        <p>About three-quarters of people who use their cell phones while driving alone in their cars called  friends or relatives, not co-workers, according to Progressive, the auto insurance company based in Mayfield Village, Ohio.

        <p>Just who are people talking to when they use their cell phones on the road? Well, probably not their bosses or secretaries.</p>
        <p>About three-quarters of people who use their cell phones while driving alone in their cars called  friends or relatives, not co-workers, according to Progressive, the auto insurance company based in Mayfield Village, Ohio. It asked the question in a survey on its Web site late last year. About 840 people responded, and the results were released last week.</p>
        <p>In fact, about one-third of those  who used their cell phones while driving alone said they had not made a work-related call in the  previous six months, although about half made their calls while driving to or from work, the company found.</p>
        <p>So who are these traveling cell phone users? Sixty-one percent were men, and 71 percent were between the ages of 18 and 34. Most drove midsize cars.</p>
        <p>About half said they used their cell phones while driving mainly because it was the most convenient time for them to be on the phone.</p>
