        <p>To the Editor: The multiple problems of Betsy Wade reminded me of Adm. Thomas H. Moorer, former chief of naval operations and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In 1942, then-Lieutenant Moorer, piloting a patrol plane, was shot down by the Japanese near Australia. A Philippine freighter rescued him and his crew, but it was sunk the same day. He assumed command of two lifeboats carrying his crew and the freighter crew. They were later rescued from an uninhabited island. He received the Silver Star.</p>
