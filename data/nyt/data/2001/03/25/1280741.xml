        <p>The Senate delivered a 69-31 rebuff to President Bush and a victory to Senators John McCain and Russell D. Feingold by rejecting a proposal to require unions and corporations to get permission from members or stockholders to use certain funds for political purposes. The vote was just one in a series that showed Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Mr. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, holding firm in their drive for a bill banning unlimited and unregulated donations to the political parties. By week's end there was even talk of compromise in the air.</p>
