        <p>Re ''His Dubya and My R,'' by Irving R. Levine (Op-Ed, Feb. 28):</p>
        <p>Here is an Irving R. Levine middle-initial story that may even compete with his own. Until my late 40's, I was just plain Irving Levine. As the American Jewish Committee's resident expert on ethnicity, I occasionally appeared in the media. I was frequently asked if I was the ''real'' Irving Levine, the famed NBC broadcaster. This was only a minor annoyance until one day.</p>

        <p>Re ''His Dubya and My R,'' by Irving R. Levine (Op-Ed, Feb. 28):</p>
        <p>Here is an Irving R. Levine middle-initial story that may even compete with his own. Until my late 40's, I was just plain Irving Levine. As the American Jewish Committee's resident expert on ethnicity, I occasionally appeared in the media. I was frequently asked if I was the ''real'' Irving Levine, the famed NBC broadcaster. This was only a minor annoyance until one day.</p>
        <p>Addressing a conference on ethnic relations, I received a message that I  was scheduled to do a live midday news show. Upon arriving in the studio, I was assaulted by the anchorwoman: ''How dare you have a full head of hair!'' (The real Irving Levine was bald.) With an arrogant recognition of error, but an unapologetic derision of me for not being the right guy, I was put on the air. Needless to say, the interview was very flat.</p>
        <p>Soon after that, I took the middle initial of my mother's maiden name.</p>
