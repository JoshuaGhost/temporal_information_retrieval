        <p>The naval inquiry into the collision between the submarine Greeneville and a Japanese fishing trawler opened with an admiral testifying that the submarine's crew made a series of errors that caused the accident, failing to communicate sonar readings and spending too little time searching the horizon.</p>
        <p>Rear Adm. Charles H. Griffiths Jr., who conducted a preliminary inquiry into the accident, said the Greeneville's ''plan of the day'' called for maneuvers to demonstrate its abilities for the visitors. But he said the sub was running about 45 minutes late because of the time the captain, Cmdr. Scott D. Waddle, spent with the visitors over lunch.</p>

        <p>Admiral Griffiths also said that the submarine's sonar room was manned by a new operator who was not qualified and was not consistently supervised during the cruise. A petty officer who could have supervised him, the admiral said, had been assigned to escort some of the 16 civilian visitors on the submarine.</p>
