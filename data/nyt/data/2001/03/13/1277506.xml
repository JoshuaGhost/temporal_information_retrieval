        <p>Bernard Holland reviews Sir Colin Davis conducting New York Philharmonic in performance of Elgar's Dream of Gerontius (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Edwardians have left us photographs, writings and even a few stammering bits of film, but it is perhaps time capsules like Elgar's ''Dream of Gerontius'' that best explain to our senses how a generation once lived. Written almost as an overture to a decade of corpulence and luxury, this near-two-hour oratorio guides a dying man from his deathbed into the next world. The big chorus speaks first from his bedside, and then transforms itself into heavenly hosts and threatening demons from below. Angels lead the man's soul along his path.</p>
        <p>''The Dream of Gerontius,'' which Sir Colin Davis brought to the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night, is a beautiful work if taken on its own terms. And that is sometimes hard to do. We live in an impatient world, and Elgar will not be hurried. Elgarian length is not the same as Wagner's, Mahler's or even Bruckner's. Wagner explodes with harmonic tension; Mahler shifts scenes nervously. Bruckner builds huge arches before our eyes and lets us hear the structural pressure of each added stone.</p>

        <p>The Edwardians have left us photographs, writings and even a few stammering bits of film, but it is perhaps time capsules like Elgar's ''Dream of Gerontius'' that best explain to our senses how a generation once lived. Written almost as an overture to a decade of corpulence and luxury, this near-two-hour oratorio guides a dying man from his deathbed into the next world. The big chorus speaks first from his bedside, and then transforms itself into heavenly hosts and threatening demons from below. Angels lead the man's soul along his path.</p>
        <p>''The Dream of Gerontius,'' which Sir Colin Davis brought to the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall on Thursday night, is a beautiful work if taken on its own terms. And that is sometimes hard to do. We live in an impatient world, and Elgar will not be hurried. Elgarian length is not the same as Wagner's, Mahler's or even Bruckner's. Wagner explodes with harmonic tension; Mahler shifts scenes nervously. Bruckner builds huge arches before our eyes and lets us hear the structural pressure of each added stone.</p>
        <p>''The Dream of Gerontius'' moves in a slow and measured walk. The orchestra prelude announces the lovely and sophisticated ideas that are about to unfold. Elgar's craftsmanship ensures a steady progress; his sincerity is passionate and utter. Elgar wins us not so much through the exciting gesture or the unexpected coup, but by accumulated weight.</p>
        <p>The true tension of this piece is in its origins: Elgar's setting of Cardinal Newman's poem during a period in England when Roman Catholics like these two were not warmly received. ''The Dream of Gerontius,'' indeed, ends not in heaven but in purgatory. Here, the soul of the dead man, according to the teachings of Rome, stops off and waits on the way to final judgment.</p>
        <p>The Philharmonic always plays well for Sir Colin and here bought into the conductor's patriotic fervor wholeheartedly. The Westminster Symphonic Choir was at least diligent in this difficult and complex music. Once one got past its odd-sounding vowels, Anthony Dean Griffey's tenor became a sympathetic and wholly committed representation of Gerontius. John Relyea's beautiful, booming bass-baritone and Michelle DeYoung's ardent mezzo-soprano took the other solo parts.</p>
