        <p>A baker's dozen down, less than a half-dozen to go.</p>
        <p>That is where the Devils stood after another impressive effort tonight in a 4-0 victory over the Vancouver Canucks at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>The Devils are playing in a manner befitting their stature as the defending Stanley Cup champions.</p>
        <p>Their winning streak rose to 13 games, and if they win five more in a row, they will surpass the National Hockey League record of 17 set in 1993 by the Pittsburgh Penguins, who will play here Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The Devils' 13 straight victories ranks as the fourth best in league history, behind Pittsburgh, the 1982 Islanders (15) and the 1929-30 Boston Bruins (14).</p>
        <p>From the backup goaltenders to the last forward on the fourth line, everyone has been playing well for the Devils.</p>
        <p>John Vanbiesbrouck was in goal tonight, as Martin Brodeur got a night off, and he registered his second shutout of the season and the 40th of his career, making 23 saves.</p>
        <p>Vanbiesbrouck, who was obtained from the Islanders in a trade earlier this month,  played extremely well, but the best player for the Devils on this night was Patrik Elias, the crafty left wing from the Czech Republic, who has been on a tear during  the streak.</p>
        <p>Elias scored two goals to reach 34 for the season, one short of the career best he set last season. He has been an inspiration to a team playing with confidence.</p>
        <p>''The whole team is playing well,'' Elias said. ''The basic part of my game is that the two guys I'm playing with are playing so well.''</p>
        <p>He was talking about his linemates, center Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora. Sykora had a goal tonight and assisted on both of Elias's goals. Arnott made the passes that led to the first goal by Elias and the goal by Sykora.</p>
        <p>Sykora said that Elias had been so effective lately because ''he's going to the net so well and he's willing to pay the price.''</p>
        <p>Elias leads the Devils in scoring with 34 goals and 48 assists. He has points in his past six games and is expected to be a key player for the Czech Republic next February in the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.</p>
        <p>He displayed his ample mobility in scoring the first goal of the game at 12 minutes 5 seconds of the first period. After pushing an opponent off the puck near the left boards, Elias sped toward an empty spot near the net.</p>
        <p>In a matter of moments, he was alone in front, from where he easily converted Arnott's pass by using his backhand to slide the puck under the left arm of Canucks goaltender Bob Essensa, who finished with 11 saves.</p>
        <p>The Devils got another goal, Jim McKenzie's second of the season, with 20 seconds left in the first, and two more before the second period was just past the halfway point.</p>
        <p>After Sykora scored his 32nd of the season only 28 seconds into the middle period, Elias got his second of the game by jamming the net and converting Brian Rafalski's pass from the right side.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Devils defenseman SCOTT NIEDERMAYER was among the first eight players named to the 2002 Canadian Olympic team. . . . Right wing TURNER STEVENSON missed the game with a sprained right ankle he sustained in the Devils' 4-0 victory over the Rangers on Wednesday night. . . . Forward SERGEI NEMCHINOV (right knee) and defenseman KEN SUTTON were the other scratches for the Devils. The Devils will play host to Pittsburgh on Sunday afternoon before leaving for games against the Tampa Bay Lightning and the Atlanta Thrashers.</p>
