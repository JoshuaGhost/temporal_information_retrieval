      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An obituary on Nov. 3 about Hellmut Alexander Lehmann-Haupt, known as Sandy, who was one of the Merry Pranksters on the novelist Ken Kesey's psychedelic bus in the 1960's, misstated the cause of his death and omitted the names of his mother and some survivors. Mr. Lehmann-Haupt died of a pulmonary embolism, not a heart attack, his family said. He was the son of Hellmut Lehmann-Haupt and Letitia Grierson. Survivors include a half sister, Roxana Lehmann-Haupt, and a half brother, John Lehmann-Haupt, both of Manhattan.</p>
