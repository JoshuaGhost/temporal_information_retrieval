        <p>Where's Osama? It is a somewhat crude way to frame the question. But among the many ''now what'' issues raised by the startlingly fast-paced events in Afghanistan, it remains the central American concern. Since Sept. 11, the main objective has been to track down Mr. bin Laden and destroy his terrorist network, Al Qaeda. Ridding Afghanistan of his Taliban protectors was a secondary goal, though obviously a big one. So Washington was delighted -- not to mention stunned -- to see the Taliban in full retreat from the capital, Kabul, as nearly half the country fell to the Northern Alliance.</p>
        <p>A MOVING QUARRY -- American intelligence officials were not sure exactly where Mr. bin Laden was, but they said he was on the move, trying to find safety in a shrinking area of southern Afghanistan that he can call a haven.</p>
        <p>The Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar, was probably not with him, the Americans said; he too was on the move. The Qaeda-Taliban marriage of convenience may be on the rocks, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said. ''Things are tough right now for some of those folks,'' he said, sounding not at all displeased.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rumsfeld reminded Americans that capturing Mr. bin Laden has been the goal from the start. It was easy to lose sight of that point, though, in the swirl of military movements. All of a sudden, Taliban forces collapsed, giving up Kabul and retreating toward Kandahar, their traditional southern stronghold. As they retreated, rebel troops moved into the capital, ignoring the wishes of Washington and its allies that they linger on the periphery until a provisional government can be stitched together from Afghanistan's rivalrous ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>SHEDDING THE OLD -- The Northern Alliance forces, helped by a small contingent of American commandos, were greeted by local residents with flowers and music. It was a good day to be a barber in Kabul. Men had their beards shaved to celebrate their release from the Taliban's viselike form of Islamic rule. Women -- a few of them, anyway -- did what was unimaginable under the Taliban: they pulled back their all-concealing robes to reveal their faces.</p>
        <p>But there were also disturbing moments that hinted at the potential for chaos. After alliance soldiers killed six Arabs and Pakistanis who had tried to ambush them, dozens of people bludgeoned the bodies with stones. One man repeatedly stabbed a corpse in the chest, then plunged his knife into the dead man's eye. Young men with stolen guns declared themselves policemen.</p>
        <p>FIGHTING FOR CONTROL -- Scenes like that stoked worries that events might be moving too fast. The United Nations, with American support, hurriedly began trying to fill the political void in Kabul with a council of disparate Afghan groups. Attention also turned to the Taliban's southern sanctuaries. There were reports of rebellious tribes massing near Kandahar, with United States Special Forces also operating in the area.</p>
        <p>No one discounted the possibility of the Taliban's holding on, or even waging an effective guerrilla war. Indeed, some of their cornered troops were fighting back in Kunduz, a northern city. And the Taliban held hostages: eight foreign aid workers, including two American women, who were arrested on charges of preaching Christianity. ''This effort against terrorism and terrorists,'' Mr. Rumsfeld cautioned, ''is far from over.''</p>
        <p>KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE -- In the United States, the terrorist attacks that produced this war continued to cause ripples. Investigators retrieved both ''black boxes'' to find out what caused American Airlines Flight 587 to crash in New York. No official called it an act of terrorism. But no one flatly ruled out the possibility, either.</p>
        <p>Another sign of the altered American landscape was a Justice Department request to various law enforcement authorities to pick up and question 5,000 men, most from the Middle East. As best as can be told, they are not suspected of terrorism, a point that led civil libertarians to condemn this ''dragnet approach.'' But the department defended its action, saying these men might know something about Al Qaeda cells in this country.</p>
        <p>And to be on the safe side, President Bush ordered that the United States' emergency supply of oil be filled to capacity for the first time. That means 700 million barrels, compared with the present 545 million barrels, good for 53 days if foreign supplies were cut off. Mr. Bush said nothing about Americans' changing their oil-consuming habits.</p>
