        <p>Shelby Lynne  Supper Club</p>
        <p>Last year Shelby Lynne released an album of songs about love and bitterness, ''I Am Shelby Lynne,'' which sloughed off a decade of Nashville habits. Its country-soul-rock hybrids baffled country-music radio programmers, yet won her a Grammy as best new artist (although it was her sixth album). On Monday night, performing at the Supper Club to introduce her new album, ''Love, Shelby'' (Island), it looked for a moment as if she was back to Nashville routine.</p>
        <p>She was wearing a rhinestone-speckled blouse and a sequined miniskirt, and she started her set belting the maudlin ''Wichita Lineman.''</p>

        <p>Shelby Lynne  Supper Club</p>
        <p>Last year Shelby Lynne released an album of songs about love and bitterness, ''I Am Shelby Lynne,'' which sloughed off a decade of Nashville habits. Its country-soul-rock hybrids baffled country-music radio programmers, yet won her a Grammy as best new artist (although it was her sixth album). On Monday night, performing at the Supper Club to introduce her new album, ''Love, Shelby'' (Island), it looked for a moment as if she was back to Nashville routine.</p>
        <p>She was wearing a rhinestone-speckled blouse and a sequined miniskirt, and she started her set belting the maudlin ''Wichita Lineman.''</p>
        <p>She is no longer holding back the ample voice that drew country producers to her in the first place, and on ''Love, Shelby,'' the songs are gussied up with gleaming, elaborate production. But onstage, she reached into her new songs more deeply. She spoke-sang verses in a lowered voice, then opened up on choruses.</p>
        <p>Her band etched contrasts more deeply instead of smoothing them over, and it dropped away entirely so she could end songs with a telling, unaccompanied phrase. ''Ain't It the Truth,'' a breakup song that sounds almost good-timey on the album, became more desperate, with slide guitar pushing toward peaks like the Rolling Stones' ''Gimme Shelter,'' while ''I Can't Wait,'' about endlessly wishing for love, almost suspended time in webs of finger-picking.</p>
        <p>Her last song, ''Tarpoleon Napoleon,'' was a quiet waltz she wrote about her father, who shot both her mother and himself. She sang it alone, recalling both his strength and his demons in a voice that merged painful memory with consolation.</p>
