        <p>Lee Ielpi, retired firefighter whose son Jonathan is buried in World Trade Center debris, succeeds in finding way for New York City to restore cuts in number of firefighters assigned to task of removing human remains from site; reduction of contingent sparked angry confrontation between firefighters and Giuliani administration; Fire Comr Thomas Von Essen, who bore brunt of firefighters' wrath, weeps as changes are announced (M)</p>

Yesterday, the size of that contingent, which the city reduced two weeks ago while citing safety concerns, was restored to its past strength.

        <p>It started with anger over a policy change at ground zero and culminated in an ugly protest with punches and barricades thrown. Yesterday, the sad story of the Fire Department at war with the mayor who loves it appeared to come to an end.</p>
        <p>The battle was fought over how many New York City firefighters should be assigned to the grim task of removing human remains at the World Trade Center. Yesterday, the size of that contingent, which the city reduced two weeks ago while citing safety concerns, was restored to its past strength. But not, it appears, because of the threats of unions or the approval of safety experts. Rather, it was because of a soft-spoken retired firefighter whose son is buried in the rubble.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as that firefighter, Lee Ielpi, told his story at the news conference where the changes were announced, Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, the object of firefighters' wrath at the most painful time in the department's history, bowed his head and wept.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ielpi worked for the Fire Department for 26 years. His sons followed him; one now works in Brooklyn, the other died in the World Trade Center, leaving a wife and two small children. Mr. Ielpi wants to recover the remains of his son Jonathan, who was 29 and worked in Squad 288 in Queens, and he doesn't want any firefighters to get hurt in the process of finding them. He thought there was a way to do both.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani listened to Mr. Ielpi's appeal in an emotional meeting with the widows and parents of firefighters on Monday. The mayor told him to go with Mr. Von Essen to ground zero and figure out how to do what he wanted.</p>
        <p>''You can't expect a city agency to be down there 8, 9, 10 hours a day,'' Mr. Ielpi said. ''I can see things.''</p>
        <p>After that site evaluation, the decision was made to increase the number of firefighters at the site to 75 per shift, about what it was before the city reduced the contingent.</p>
        <p>The city also altered procedures at the work site. The group of firefighters -- aided by 50 officers from the New York Police Department and the Port Authority Police -- will work in more organized fashion now, Mr. Von Essen said. Spotters, who peer into the moving rubble for remains, will wear high-visibility vests, and each group of workers will be assigned to a specific area instead of wandering around the site.</p>
        <p>City officials also decided to reduce the number of large earth-movers on the site to prevent bodies or body parts from accidentally being lifted and dumped into piles of rubble that are sent to Staten Island for sorting. And the department will form a family assistance unit to work with grieving families.</p>
        <p>''We've been trying to do the best we can from Day 1,'' said Mr. Von Essen, who left the news conference for a moment after he began to weep as Mr. Ielpi approached the lectern. ''We have made some mistakes. But the intentions have never been anything but the same on each side.''</p>
        <p>This month, the city ordered the department to reduce the number of firefighters at the site to 25, from about 65. The decision infuriated firefighters and many victims' families, who argued that remains were being removed in a ''scoop and dump'' fashion and that more workers were needed to properly excavate.</p>
        <p>First, members of the firefighters and officers unions tried to negotiate with Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles. Mr. Coles reiterated the mayor's safety concerns, saying that there had been accidents involving heavy equipment at the site. The union leaders warned that firefighters would protest the decision.</p>
        <p>The firefighters' demonstration, on Nov. 2, resulted in a melee at the site that ended in 18 arrests. Accusations and recriminations flew.</p>
        <p>The city added some firefighters back to the reduced recovery force, but it did not mollify the department. Union officials and others openly questioned Mr. Von Essen's motives in supporting the city's cutbacks at the site, accusing him of trying to keep overtime costs down and of simply not caring.</p>
        <p>Mr. Von Essen has said publicly that he has felt battered by firefighters' accusations, and his tears yesterday seemed a momentary culmination of two months of horror. Mayor Giuliani looked on in silence.</p>
        <p>Last week, a group of firefighters and widows of those lost in the rubble announced the formation of the Sept. 11 Widows' and Victims' Families Association, led by Marian Fontana, widow of Firefighter David Fontana from Squad 1 in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Suddenly, the embattled families had a voice outside of the unions, and the mayor and the fire commissioner agreed to listen to their concerns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Von Essen described two meetings, one last week with eight widows and another with 75 family members on Monday. At the larger meeting, families spoke about their need to find remains. The medical examiner answered bluntly that many of the bodies disintegrated in the terror attack.</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Ielpi, who was a highly decorated and respected member of the department, spoke up. ''He said he believed in safety and that he did not want to see any more firefighters lose their life,'' said one person who attended the meetings. ''But he added that he thought they could put more firefighters there and that they could run the operation better. I think it was because he spoke authoritatively and intelligently, and that impressed the mayor.''</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Ielpi visited the site and came up with a list of recommendations, many of which the fire commissioner found sound, said an official who attended the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ielpi said yesterday that he believed the conflict need never have occurred.</p>
        <p>''If the families would have started this group two weeks after the disaster, all this could have been avoided,'' he said. But then again, he said, there was no precedent. ''It was a subject that was so monstrous. We didn't know how to deal with it.''</p>
