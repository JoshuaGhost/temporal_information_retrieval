        <p>HOLLYWOOD would love to know what America wants to see at the movies this holiday season. (If only we knew ourselves.) Some big films have been moved to 2002, in hopes that times will be better or, as we say wistfully every day, ''back to normal.'' A few serious, possibly Oscar-worthy pictures will open over the next two months, but the sure thing this season is fantasy. Thank God for Harry Potter and hobbits and time travel and terrifying stories set in a distant future that has nothing to do with us.</p>

        <p>NOVEMBER</p>
        <p>'OTOMO': Racism and violence in Germany. A West African man (Isaach de Bankol√©) has an ugly confrontation with policemen in the Stuttgart subway. Inspired by a real incident and directed by Frieder Schlaich. Opens Wednesday.  'EVERYTHING PUT TOGETHER': A low-budget drama about the death of a newborn baby. Radha Mitchell (''High Art'') stars as the distraught mother, whose friends abandon her; Justin Louis plays her husband. Directed by Marc Forster, it was a hit at Sundance. Friday.  'HEIST': David Mamet's long-awaited contribution to the genre of the same name. Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito and Delroy Lindo star in this drama about a gang of thieves planning a jewelry-store job. Highly verbal thieves, we presume. Friday.  'I REMEMBER ME': A documentary about chronic fatigue syndrome. The filmmaker, Kim Snyder, is a sufferer, as are the director Blake Edwards and the former soccer star Michelle Akers. Friday.  'KEEPING IT REAL: THE ADVENTURES OF GREG WALLOCH': A documentary about a gay comic with cerebral palsy. His subjects include the sexual prowess of the disabled and a shocking campaign to promote bibliophilia in Chelsea. Directed by Eli Kabillio. Friday.  'KING OF THE JUNGLE': John Leguizamo stars in a street drama about a mentally disabled young man looking for his mother's killer. Meanwhile his mother's lover (Rosie Perez) is searching for him. Directed by Seth Zvi Rosenfeld, complete with a hooker with a heart of gold (Annabella Sciorra). Friday.  'MAZE': Rob Morrow wrote, directed and stars in a romantic drama about an artist with Tourette's syndrome who falls for his best friend's girlfriend (the easy-to-love Laura Linney). Complications: The boyfriend (Craig Sheffer) is out of the country. She's pregnant. Friday.  'SHALLOW HAL': The Farrelly brothers put Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit (for part of the movie). Ms. Paltrow plays Rosemary, an unattractive, overweight young woman adored by Hal (Jack Black), who has been hypnotized to see only women's inner beauty, not their surface appearance. And inside, Rosemary is a beautiful, thin blonde with great cheekbones. It's a comedy, with Jason Alexander as Hal's best friend. Friday.  'THE WASH': Hip-hop stars working just like regular guys. Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg take jobs at a car wash to make ends meet. Then their boss (George Wallace) is kidnapped. An action comedy written and directed by D. J. Pooh (''Three Strikes''). Nov. 14.  'ABCD': The sister is promiscuous (defined by her sex life). The brother is a successful accountant (defined by his work). They're both Asian Indian immigrants in America, torn between two cultures. With Faran Tahir, Sheetal Sheth and Aasif Mandvi. Directed by Krutin Patel. Nov. 16.  'BOMBAY EUNUCH': An ancient royal tradition meets the 21st century. The film was named best documentary at this year's New York Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. Directed by Michelle Gucovsky, Sean MacDonald and Alexandra Shiva. Nov. 16.  'THE FLUFFER': A romantic triangle in the gay porn industry. It involves a straight actor who makes gay films (Scott Gurney); his stripper girlfriend (Roxanne Day) and the new boy on the set (Michael Cunio). Richard Glatzer and Wash West directed. Nov. 16.  'HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE': Daniel Radcliffe plays the world's most famous orphan whose cruel adoptive parents don't know he's a powerful wizard. The first of J. K. Rowling's sinfully popular books about Harry comes to the screen, directed by Chris Columbus. If the books' young fans like its interpretation of Potter trademarks like the Hogwarts School, Quidditch games on broomsticks and the underground goblin sanctuary, this will be an instant classic. Also, box office will go through the roof. Supporting players include Richard Harris as Headmaster Dumbledore, Dame Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall, Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid the gamekeeper and John Cleese as Nearly Headless Nick. Nov. 16.  'NOVOCAINE': Steve Martin in a serious (well, at least very darkly comic) sex-and-drugs crime thriller. He's an affluent dentist with a new patient (Helena Bonham Carter) who runs with a bad crowd. (But how will we forget the dentist Mr. Martin played in ''Little Shop of Horrors''?) Nov. 16.  'THE SIMIAN LINE': Four couples in Weehawken, N.J. All have strong reactions when a fortuneteller (Tyne Daly) announces one relationship won't last until the new year. The couples are Harry Connick Jr. and Lynn Redgrave (May-December), Cindy Crawford and Jamey Sheridan (the ambitious ones), Monica Keena and Dylan Bruno (the young ones), and William Hurt and Samantha Mathis (the ghosts). Linda Yellen directed. Nov. 16.  'AMERICAN ADOBO': More culture-bridging. A comedy about five single Filipino- American friends in New York. With Paolo Montalban and Randy Becker. Directed by Laurice Guillen. Nov. 21.  'BLACK KNIGHT': Martin Lawrence in a time-travel comedy set in 1328. Medieval is big this year. Directed by Gil Junger (''10 Things I Hate About You''). Nov. 21.  'THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE': A ghost story set during the Spanish Civil War. A 10-year-old boy (Fernando Tielve) arrives at a school for orphans where the caretaker (Eduardo Noriega) seems dangerous and a young ghost (''the one that sighs'') wanders the grounds. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro  (''Cronos.'') Nov. 21. A related article is on Page 31.  'OUT COLD': A snowboarding comedy with Lee Majors and an ensemble of young unknowns (Flex Alexander, A. J. Cook, Caroline Dhavernas). Directed by Emmett and Brendan Malloy. Nov. 21.  'SIDEWALKS OF NEW YORK': Edward Burns's latest, already compared (for better or worse) to Woody Allen's urban-neurotic romantic comedies. Mr. Burns, Heather Graham and Stanley Tucci star in the story of half a dozen Manhattanites looking for love -- and connected in ways they don't know. Nov. 21.  'SPY GAME': Robert Redford and Brad Pitt in a C.I.A. suspense drama. How much blond handsomeness can we stand? Mr. Pitt is in a Chinese prison. Mr. Redford is his mentor, trying to free him on the brink of his own retirement (oh, that old plot device). This is the first time the two have worked together since Mr. Redford directed Mr. Pitt, then unknown, in ''A River Runs Through It.'' Tony Scott (''Enemy of the State'') directed. Nov. 21.  'THE WAY WE LAUGHED': A drama about two Sicilian brothers, one of them illiterate, living in Turin. Directed by Gianni Amelio (''Lamerica''). It won a cinematography award at the Venice Film Festival. Nov. 21.  'BANGKOK DANGEROUS': A sociopathic deaf mute killer finally meets the right woman. A Thai action thriller from the Pang brothers, Oxide and Danny. Starring Pawalit Mongkolpisit and Premsinee Ratanasopha. Nov. 23.  'IN THE BEDROOM': An intense family drama based on an Andre Dubus short story. Sissy Spacek and Tom Wilkinson play a Maine couple whose only child (Nick Stahl) is involved with an older woman (Marisa Tomei). The affair leads to tragedy. Directed by Todd Field, the film won a special acting prize at Sundance. Nov. 23.  'THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE': Hilary Swank gets dressed up. She plays Jeanne de la Motte-Valois, an 18th-century noblewoman out for revenge against the French royal family. Based on a true story. Directed by Charles Shyer, whose past films have been homier (''Baby Boom,'' ''Father of the Bride''). Nov. 30.  'BEHIND THE SUN': From Walter Salles, who did ''Central Station,'' the story of a generations-long family feud in 1910 Brazil. Based on Ismail Kadare's novel ''Broken April.'' With Jos√© Dumont and Rodrigo Santoro. Nov. 30.  'THE INDEPENDENT': You remember Morty Fineman (Jerry Stiller), the prolific filmmaker of classics like ''Cheerleader Camp Massacre'' and ''Teenie Weenie Bikini Beach.'' A mock documentary clearly inspired by the career of Roger Corman. It won the top prize at Slamdunk, one of the Sundance alternatives. Directed by Stephen Kessler, with Janeane Garofalo as Morty's estranged daughter, Paloma. Nov. 30.</p>
        <p>'IN JULY': A German romantic comedy about a young teacher who changes his mind about staying in Hamburg for the summer. Moritz Bleibtreu and Christiane Paul star. Written and directed by Fatih Akin, and filmed partly in Budapest and Istanbul. Nov. 30.</p>
        <p>'PORNSTAR: THE LEGEND OF RON JEREMY': He's a short, fat, unattractive pornography-film legend. Now, after starring in more than 600 movies (many with titles like ''Luau Orgy'' and ''For Your Thighs Only''), he wants to be taken seriously. A documentary directed by Scott Gill. Nov. 30.  'SUPER TROOPERS': Overenthusiastic Vermont state troopers having a good time. Written by and starring the five-man comedy team Broken Lizard. Directed by Jay Chandrasekhar, one of the five. They loved it at Sundance. Nov. 30.  'TEXAS RANGERS': A genuine actual western that has been threatening to open since spring 2000. The mostly young stars include some TV heroes (James Van Der Beek, Dylan McDermott, Ashton Kutcher). Directed by Steve Miner, it's about the founding of the Rangers after the Civil War. Nov. 30.</p>
        <p>DECEMBER</p>
        <p>'B-52': Hartmut Bitomsky's documentary about the bombers of the same name. They have wingspans as wide as a football field, carry a crew of six and have a range of 8,388 miles without refueling. And who would have thought we'd care? Dec. 5.</p>
        <p>'PI√ëERO': Benjamin Bratt plays Miguel Pi√±ero, Nuyorican poet, playwright, Tony Award nominee, actor, TV writer, heroin addict and ex-con. Unlike Reinaldo Arenas, the subject of last year's ''Before Night Falls,'' this artist enjoyed his success before dying young of AIDS. With Mandy Patinkin as Joseph Papp. Written and directed by Leon Ichaso. Dec. 5.  'THE BUSINESS OF STRANGERS': Think of it as ''In the Company of Women.'' At an airport hotel, an executive (Stockard Channing) and her young assistant (Julia Stiles) bridge the generation and income gap, then decide to play strange games with a corporate headhunter (Frederick Weller). A drama with black comedy, written and directed by Patrick Stettner. Dec. 7.  'EBAN AND CHARLEY': An ex-soccer coach returns to his hometown and bonds with a 15-year-old boy. Their families object. Brent Fellows and Giovanni Andrade star in this drama written and directed by James Bolton. Dec. 7.  'FINAL': Denis Leary as a man who is either insane or in a lot of trouble. Waking up in a small locked room, he believes it's 2399 and he's just been cryogenically unfrozen so he can be carved up into ''donor organ packets.'' Hope Davis plays his doctor. A psychological thriller directed by Campbell Scott. Dec. 7.  'NO MAN'S LAND': Three soldiers in an abandoned trench: one Serb, two Bosnian -- and one is lying on top of a spring bomb. When a U.N. official and a journalist try to help, the situation becomes a media circus. A satiric drama written and directed by Tanis Danovic. Filmed in the former Yugoslav republic Slovenia. Dec. 7. A related article is on Page 31.  'OCEAN'S 11': George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Julia Roberts and a few others star in a not-exactly-remake of Sinatra and the Rat Pack's not-exactly-good 1960 heist film. This time the gang is planning to hit Las Vegas casinos during a high-profile boxing match. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, which should count for something. Dec. 7.  'PRINCESA': A nice Brazilian boy working as a transvestite prostitute in Milan finds the man of his dreams, complete with more than enough money for a sex-change operation. But the dream disappoints. Directed by Henrique Goldman and based on the memoirs of Fernanda Farias de Albuquerque, who later committed suicide. Ingrid de Souza stars as Fernanda. Dec. 7.  'AS I WAS MOVING AHEAD OCCASIONALLY I SAW BRIEF GLIMPSES OF BEAUTY': A full 4 hours and 48 minutes of Jonas Mekas's 16-mm film diary. Mr. Mekas includes family scenes, European travel and lots of New York. Dec. 12.  'ESCAPE TO LIFE: THE ERIKA AND KLAUS MANN STORY': A documentary about the children of the author Thomas Mann. They were both gay, anti-Fascist and brave enough to satirize the Third Reich in their cabaret act. Directed by Andrea Weiss and Wieland Speck. With the voices of two other outspoken siblings, Vanessa and Corin Redgrave. Dec. 14.  'IRIS': A romantic, sure to be tear-jerking drama about the British novelist Iris Murdoch. She's played by Kate Winslet as a young woman at Oxford and by Dame Judi Dench as the older Murdoch, who loses all to Alzheimer's. Hugh Bonneville and Jim Broadbent play John Bayley, Murdoch's husband, whose memoirs the film is based on. Directed by Richard Eyre. Dec. 14.  'NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE': A high school football star (Chris Evans) bets he can turn a bespectacled nerd (Chyler Leigh) into a prom queen. But this comedy, directed by Joel Gallen (whose claim to fame is having produced the MTV Movie Awards show for a decade), sets out to play with the usual clich√©s. Mr. T is listed in the cast, which could be a sign. Dec. 14.  'VANILLA SKY': This year's Meg-and-Russell award -- for the co-star romance that overshadows the film where it all began -- goes to this romantic comedy from Cameron Crowe. Tom Cruise is a handsome, womanizing publishing tycoon looking for his soul (just like Jerry Maguire). Pen√©lope Cruz, as his best friend's girlfriend, has played this role before: in ''Abre los Ojos,'' the 1997 Spanish film that inspired this one. Dec.14. A related article is on Page 3.  'LITTLE OTIK': It's based on an old Czech fairy tale. When a couple can't have children, the husband just carves a baby out of a stump. Unfortunately, it turns into a monster. A combination of live action and Claymation, written and directed by Jan Svankmajer. Dec. 19.  'LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING': Elves, hobbits, trolls, dwarves, orcs, ents, ringwraiths and a magic ring that must be destroyed. The first in a film trilogy based on J. R. R. Tolkien's cult fantasy novels. With Elijah Wood as Frodo, Sir Ian McKellen as the good wizard Gandalf and a supporting cast that includes Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler, Sean Astin and Christopher Lee. Directed by Peter Jackson (''Heavenly Creatures'') and filmed in New Zealand. So that's what Middle Earth looks like. Dec. 19.  'GOSFORD PARK': Robert Altman mixes ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' and murder. A comedy-of-manners mystery set in 1932 at an English country estate. Mr. Altman loves big ensemble casts, and here he has a mostly British one, including Alan Bates, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi, Helen Mirren, Jeremy Northam, Maggie Smith and Emily Watson. Dec. 21.  'HOW HIGH': Two stupid young men get into Harvard by smoking a particular kind of marijuana (which, inexplicably, makes them temporarily brilliant). Then they run out of the stuff. With the rap stars Redman and Method Man. Directed by Jesse Dylan, son of Bob, who once had something to say about getting stoned. Dec. 21.  'JIMMY NEUTRON: BOY GENIUS': Starring space aliens who look like green egg yolks. Thank goodness they're animated, as is the brilliant 10-year-old boy who has to save the people of Retroville from the invaders. With the voices of Martin Short and Patrick Stewart. Directed by John Davis. Dec. 21.  'JOE SOMEBODY': A divorced corporate nobody (Tim Allen) turns his life around. He has to. He's just been publicly humiliated at the office in front of his daughter. A comic drama from John Pasquin, who also directed Mr. Allen in ''The Santa Clause.'' Dec. 21.  'KATE AND LEOPOLD': Time travel turns romantic. Meg Ryan is a 21st-century single American executive; Hugh Jackman is a 19th-century bachelor English duke, who has accidentally been transported (by Liev Schreiber) to present-day New York. As long as he's here, they might as well tour the city and fall in love. Directed by James Mangold, who did ''Girl, Interrupted.'' Dec. 21.  'LANTANA': One woman's disappearance affects four marriages. Anthony LaPaglia is the detective on the case. With Geoffrey Rush and Barbara Hershey. A psychological thriller directed by Ray Lawrence. Dec. 21. A related article is on Page 13.  'THE MAJESTIC': Jim Carrey gets serious again and, by all reports, highly Capraesque. He plays a 1950's blacklisted writer who loses his memory and finds a new life in a small town. With Martin Landau as the local movie theater owner, Bob Balaban as the HUAC guy and Laurie Holden as the ponytailed love interest. Directed by Frank Darabont (''The Shawshank Redemption,'' ''The Green Mile''). Dec. 21. Related articles are on Page 34.  'THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS': When bad things happen to early bloomers. Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Stiller and Luke Wilson star as the amazingly brilliant, successful children of Gene Hackman and Anjelica Huston. But they've all gone seriously downhill, and now they're having a reunion. A comedy directed by Wes Anderson, who gave us ''Rushmore.'' Dec. 21.  'ALI': If anybody can play the boxing legend Muhammad Ali with the right blend of wit, anger and, of course, greatness, it's probably Will Smith, who hasn't had a real acting challenge since ''Six Degrees of Separation.'' He gets his chance in this drama directed by Michael Mann, whose last film was ''The Insider.'' With Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, Mario Van Peebles and Jeffrey Wright. Dec. 25.  'A BEAUTIFUL MIND': Russell Crowe as a math genius with schizophrenia and an active sex life. A drama based on a biography of John Forbes Nash Jr., the Nobel Prize-winning father of game-theory economics. With Ed Harris and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Ron Howard, whose last was ''How the Grinch Stole Christmas.'' Dec. 25. A related article is on Page 13.  'IMPOSTOR': Gary Sinise and Madeleine Stowe in a futuristic sci-fi romance. He's an engineer who invented a fabulous anti-alien weapon, but now people suspect he's an alien clone. Directed by Gary Fleder. Dec. 25.  'THE SHIPPING NEWS': Kevin Spacey in Lasse Hallstrom's film of E. Annie Proulx's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. It's a drama about a writer who moves to Newfoundland after the death of his estranged wife (Cate Blanchett) and digs up a few secrets. Julianne Moore is his new love interest. Dame Judi Dench is his long-lost aunt. Dec. 25.  'MONSTER'S BALL': Billy Bob Thornton as a Southern death-row prison guard who falls in love with the widow (Halle Berry) of a man he just executed. With Heath Ledger and Peter Boyle. A drama directed by Marc Forster and filmed partly at Angola, the Louisiana penitentiary. Dec. 26.  'CHARLOTTE GRAY': Cate Blanchett as a young Scotswoman working underground in the French resistance. This is Gillian Armstrong's version of Sebastian Faulks's romantic World War II novel set mostly in rural France. Charlotte does it all in search of the R.A.F. pilot she loves but finds a handsome resistance leader (Billy Crudup) and his father (Michael Gambon) pretty fascinating too. They've changed the book's ending, which was, let's face it, a little too realistic. Dec. 28. A related article is on Page 3.  'DARK BLUE WORLD': From the people who gave us the Oscar-winning ''Kolya'' -- who must have seen ''Pearl Harbor.'' A World War II drama about two Czech pilots, close friends who join the British R.A.F. and fall in love with the same woman. Ondrej Vetchy, Krystof Hadek and Tara Fitzgerald star. Directed by Jan Sverak and written by Zdenek Sverak, his father. Dec. 28.  'I AM SAM': Sean Penn in intense dramatic mode as a mentally retarded man trying to win custody of his daughter. With Michelle Pfeiffer, Laura Dern and Loretta Devine. Directed by Jessie Nelson, who dealt with father-daughter difficulties a few years ago in ''Corrina, Corrina.'' Dec. 28.</p>
        <p>'PAULINE AND PAULETTE': Two self-involved Belgian women refuse to care for their mentally retarded sister after the oldest sister dies. Then they read the will. A family drama with Dora van der Groen, Ann Peterson and Rosemarie Berghmans. Directed by Lieven Debrauwer. December.</p>
        <p>JANUARY</p>
        <p>'EISENSTEIN': At 27 he was considered the greatest filmmaker in the world. Simon McBurney plays Sergei Eisenstein as he makes his reputation with ''The Battleship Potemkin'' (1925). Written and directed by Renny Bartlett. Jan. 2.  '42K': Four guys in a rock band end up with a necklace that wards off vampires. Ninjas, evangelical Christians and one gangsta rapper are also involved. Jan. 4.  'THE ACCIDENTAL SPY': Jackie Chan as an exercise equipment salesman? Yes, but he still becomes involved with jewel thieves, an international conspiracy and a virus. Directed by Teddy Chen. Jan. 11.  'ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS': Ice Cube and Mike Epps, who did ''Next Friday'' together, in an ''action crime comedy,'' as a bounty hunter and a bail jumper who decide to team up. Directed by Kevin Bray. Jan. 11.  'BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF': Possibly a new genre blend: a French martial-arts horror costume-drama romance. Samuel Le Bihan plays an 18th-century scientist assigned to find a homicidal monster roaming the provinces. With Mark Dacascos as the scientist's American Indian blood brother, Vincent Cassel as a one-armed aristocrat and Monica Bellucci as a psychic prostitute. A hit in France. Directed by Christophe Gans. Jan. 11.  'ORANGE COUNTY': Next-generation Hollywood steps up to the plate.

Directed by Jake Kasdan (Lawrence Kasdan's son). Jan. 11.  'THE FAREWELL': One day in the life of Bertolt Brecht. It's late summer, and he's leaving his lakeside house to go back to Berlin and surrounded by women. Josef Bierbichler stars. Jan Sch√ºtte directed. Jan. 16.  'THE ADVENTURES OF PLUTO NASH': Eddie Murphy as a nightclub owner on the moon. The year is 2087, and the local mob is making trouble. A sci-fi comedy directed by Ron Underwood (''City Slickers''). Jan. 18.  'BEHIND ENEMY LINES': A Navy pilot (Owen Wilson) is shot down over enemy territory and his commanding officer (Gene Hackman) decides to try to rescue him. A drama directed by John Moore. Jan. 18.  'BLACK HAWK DOWN': A war movie from Ridley Scott, who knows conflict and evil (from ''Alien'' and ''Blade Runner'' to ''Gladiator'' and ''Hannibal''). The true story of American special forces in Somalia in 1993, on a mission that goes extremely wrong. The cast includes Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Ron Eldard and Sam Shepard. The screenplay's co-writer is Steven Zaillian, who did ''Schindler's List.'' Jan. 18.  'ITALIAN FOR BEGINNERS': From Denmark, a romantic comic drama about students hoping to find love in Italian class. A Dogma production written and directed by Lone Scherfig. With Anders W. Berthelsen and Ann Eleonora Jorgensen. It won multiple awards at the Berlin International Film Festival. Jan. 18.  'KILLING ME SOFTLY': The Chinese director Chen Kaige makes his English-language debut with an erotic suspense thriller. Heather Graham is a London scientist who risks everything for her sexual relationship with a mountaineer (Joseph Fiennes) she meets while crossing the street. Jan. 18.  'SLACKERS': Not a sequel to Richard Linklater's ''Slacker.'' A completely different film about a geek, a college-grades scam, blackmail and the pursuit of the most beautiful girl on campus.

After the section had gone to press, ''A.B.C.D.'' was rescheduled to open on Nov. 30 (not Nov. 16); ''Behind Enemy Lines'' on Nov. 30 (not Jan. 18); ''Black Hawk Down'' on Dec. 24 (not Jan. 18); and ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' on Dec. 14 (not Dec. 21).</p>
