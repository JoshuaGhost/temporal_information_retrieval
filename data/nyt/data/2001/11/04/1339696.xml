        <p>IF you use a laptop computer while traveling, other people may be looking over your shoulder. But eShades, which look like a pair of oversized sunglasses, let you switch off the laptop monitor and view sensitive material privately. And to the outside world, you might just look like Joe Cool.</p>
        <p>When plugged into a laptop, eShades offer a large-screen viewing experience: the images look as if they are on a 19-inch monitor two and a half feet away.</p>
        <p>Alfred Hildebrand, the chairman of the eShades maker, Inviso Inc., a privately held company in Sunnyvale, Calif., has founded or worked with several companies involved in laser or optical technology. He was a co-founder of InViso in 1994, when he was a venture capital investor.</p>
        <p>To combine the benefits of the fax machine and his pager's portability, Mr. Hildebrand developed small screens to allow a pager to receive a fax message. As portable communications devices proliferated, he then redesigned the displays for personal digital assistants and laptop computers. Mr. Hildebrand produced a final eShades prototype in May 2000. The glasses will be sold starting early next year.</p>
        <p>The displays in eShades work much like traditional laptop displays. Liquid crystal is sandwiched between two pieces of glass, and a silicon chip imbedded in the glass transmits electronic signals that cue the crystal to create the desktop image. The flat-panel liquid crystal display is about an inch from each eye; an optical magnifier creates the feeling of a large display. ''It's like looking at a big-screen TV,'' Mr. Hildebrand said. Because the lighted image is so small, the battery uses only about a quarter of the power of conventional laptop displays.</p>
        <p>EShades, which weigh about twice as much as regular sunglasses, will cost about $500, but Mr. Hildebrand expects the price to drop to about $300 ''sometime later on,'' he said.</p>
