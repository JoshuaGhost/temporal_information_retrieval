        <p>A member of an American Special Operations team suffering high-altitude sickness was evacuated from Afghanistan in an emergency rescue operation, military officials said early today.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the United States Central Command in Florida, which is managing the war in Afghanistan, said, ''That person is out of Afghanistan.''</p>
        <p>An initial mission to rescue the soldier was aborted on Friday after one of two helicopters sent in to extract him crashed because of foul weather.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon continued to strike military forces of the Kabul regime on Saturday and todaywith an array of warplanes, including heavy bombers and strike fighters based on land and at sea. Military officials said the bombing had been continuous and focused on units defending key cities from opposition forces.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld left Moscow and flew to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, two states of the former Soviet Union that border Afghanistan on the north. His discussions with leaders there were to focus on cooperation in the war, including the possible expansion of basing rights, access to airspace or troop deployments. He also plans to go on to Pakistan and India.</p>
        <p>In renewed ground fighting in the north, rebel commanders claimed to have gained new ground outside the strategic crossroads city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which Taliban forces hold.</p>
        <p>Pentagon officials continue to characterize the tactical situation there as ''fluid,'' with an ''ebb and flow'' as the Taliban are entrenched but having difficulty resupplying, while the rebel Northern Alliance forces have not been able to move forcefully.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon said today that about 65 American warplanes struck targets near Kabul, Kunduz and Kandahar on Friday.</p>
