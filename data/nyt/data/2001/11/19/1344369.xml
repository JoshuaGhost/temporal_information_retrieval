        <p>The Baltimore Ravens had heard and seen enough of the Browns' crowing and clowning over Cleveland's victory when these teams met last month, so this afternoon the Ravens set out to clarify a few things. The Ravens wanted the wunderkind Browns to know that the Lombardi Trophy still resided in Baltimore. That the champion Ravens had dominated their division over the last two seasons and had no intention of relinquishing that grip.</p>
        <p>Some things, the Browns learned, you just have to take.</p>
        <p>So Cleveland did, dismissing Baltimore, 27-17, in a game in which the older, wiser, more successful Ravens imploded. A lost fumble by the Ravens coupled with four Elvis Grbac interceptions completed a game of shoddy, bumpy and perplexing play by the Ravens, who had won eight straight at PSINet Stadium.</p>
        <p>The crowd of 69,353 hardly recognized this bunch.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to lose at home, and we can't let it cascade beyond this,'' Ravens Coach Brian Billick said. ''It's not the game we wanted to play.''</p>
        <p>Ravens cornerback Duane Starks said: ''They complete passes, and they keep drives going. They play to win. We have to put this in the past because the only thing that matters now is what you do next.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the Browns' coach, receiver Qadry Ismail said: ''Butch Davis has that team believing in itself. This is not the Cleveland Browns that people are used to seeing.''</p>
        <p>Especially the ones the Ravens were used to seeing.</p>
        <p>Baltimore fell to 6-4 while Cleveland improved to 5-4. Cleveland trailed in nearly every statistical category today but turnovers, where it won, 5-3. And beating Baltimore in the turnover game means everything -- the Ravens are 0-4 when they lose the turnover battle but are 6-0 when they win it.</p>
        <p>Baltimore got through the first quarter without a turnover but trailed, 3-0. The Ravens reached the Browns' 1-yard line on their first possession, but a pass by Grbac on fourth-and-goal failed. In the second quarter, a Grbac interception by cornerback Anthony Henry -- and that would be a recurring theme in this game -- set up Ben Gay's 7-yard touchdown run. Cleveland was ahead, 10-0. On the Ravens' next possession, Grbac was intercepted by safety Devin Bush.</p>
        <p>Bush returned the ball 43 yards for a touchdown, and suddenly, 8 minutes 9 seconds before halftime, Cleveland had a 17-0 lead. It was 20-7 at halftime.</p>
        <p>Since Cleveland had lost consecutive overtime games to Chicago and Pittsburgh by a field goal, the question was, would the Browns have staying power?</p>
        <p>''First and foremost, we are an aggressive defense,'' Browns linebacker Jamir Miller said. ''We believe if we play our game things will work out fine. I don't want to hear their excuses; we had turnovers, too. It comes down to who makes the most plays. We got after it and hit their quarterback. I don't know a quarterback in this league who likes to get hit. And you hit 'em enough, it takes its toll.''</p>
        <p>It must have with Grbac, who was 23 of 44 in passing for 261 yards and 2 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>He threw another interception to Henry on Baltimore's first drive of the second half. Henry would have three by game's end. But Cleveland quarterback Tim Couch threw two interceptions in the third quarter, too. Back and forth it went, with Cleveland ahead, 20-17, entering the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Baltimore's four drives in the final quarter ended this way: punt, punt, incomplete pass and incomplete pass. Cleveland, however, pieced together a 12-play, 68-yard touchdown drive midway through the quarter that helped bury Baltimore.</p>
        <p>The key play was a fourth-and-1 quick reverse around right end by receiver Dennis Northcutt that gained 12 yards to the Baltimore 23. Jamel White's 1-yard run capped the drive. White and Gay combined for the biggest portion of Cleveland's big day (95 yards, 2 rushing touchdowns) against the Ravens' vaunted run defense.</p>
        <p>Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis blamed his entire defense. Ismail blamed the entire offense. The Browns credited themselves for finishing what they started. But Ravens tight end Shannon Sharpe, who today set the record for career catches (669) by a tight end, made it clear what the fans were thinking (they chanted for the backup Randall Cunningham to replace Grbac) and maybe what some of the Ravens and Browns were thinking, too.</p>
        <p>''He was brought here to do a job, and the job is not being done,'' Sharpe said of Grbac. ''We've got to do a better job of protecting him and he's got to do a better job of protecting the football. I think Elvis understands that when he came here he was going to be the most criticized -- win, lose or draw. I don't know if Elvis is down, but he can't go any lower. Ultimately, it comes back to Elvis. Elvis has got to pull the trigger.''</p>
