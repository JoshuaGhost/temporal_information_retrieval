        <p>One player was an unknown because he had played 133 games in the minor leagues before this season. The other player was a bit of an unknown because his glossy accomplishments had all occurred in the Japanese league. But Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals and Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners immediately became well known, and by the end of the season it was obvious that they were the best rookies in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>That notion became official yesterday when Pujols was unanimously selected the National League's rookie of the year and Suzuki took the American League honor. But shockingly, Suzuki, who had an unforgettable debut and is a strong candidate for the A.L. Most Valuable Player award, fell one vote shy of being a unanimous choice. Any doubts about the 21-year-old Pujols or the 28-year-old Suzuki never surfaced as they were perhaps the most indispensable players on their respective teams.</p>

        <p>One player was an unknown because he had played 133 games in the minor leagues before this season. The other player was a bit of an unknown because his glossy accomplishments had all occurred in the Japanese league. But Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals and Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners immediately became well known, and by the end of the season it was obvious that they were the best rookies in the major leagues.</p>
        <p>That notion became official yesterday when Pujols was unanimously selected the National League's rookie of the year and Suzuki took the American League honor. But shockingly, Suzuki, who had an unforgettable debut and is a strong candidate for the A.L. Most Valuable Player award, fell one vote shy of being a unanimous choice. Any doubts about the 21-year-old Pujols or the 28-year-old Suzuki never surfaced as they were perhaps the most indispensable players on their respective teams.</p>
        <p>Pujols, who played first base, third base and the outfield, batted .329, hit 37 homers and set an N.L. record for runs batted in by a rookie with 130. Houston pitcher Roy Oswalt finished second, and Philadelphia shortstop Jimmy Rollins was third. Suzuki, a right fielder, led the majors with a .350 average and 56 stolen bases, the first time a rookie topped both categories in a league since Jackie Robinson, whose name graces the award, did so in the National League in 1949. Suzuki also set a rookie record with 242 hits.</p>
        <p>Cleveland's C. C. Sabathia, who was 17-5 with a 4.39 earned run average, received the only first-place vote Suzuki did not get. The vote came from Chris Assenheimer of The Chronicle-Telegram in Elyria, Ohio, who covers the Indians. He said Sabathia ''met the criteria a little bit better in the truest sense of being a rookie.'' Sabathia finished second, and Alfonso Soriano of the Yankees was third.</p>
        <p>''I was so relieved today I heard the announcement I won the rookie of the year, because I felt this is an award I should have won, without any doubt,'' Suzuki said.</p>
        <p>Suzuki clarified that he was not alluding to the incredible statistics he produced. Suzuki apparently felt this award was his from the moment he signed with the Mariners last November because of the nine years he played for the Orix Blue Wave in Japan's Pacific League. Before Suzuki had his first single, he knew he could succeed here and expected this result.</p>
        <p>''Looking back where I've played nine years in Japan, I was a little embarrassed to be called a rookie here in the United States,'' Suzuki said. ''But I have not played in the United States. This is the first time playing in the United States, except the time I played winter ball in Hawaii. Maybe I was a rookie this year.''</p>
        <p>Pujols might have been the most surprising player in the majors, because not even the Cardinals could have expected him to have such an impact so quickly. He was the organization's player of the year in 2000 after batting .314 with 19 homers and 96 R.B.I. at three different minor league levels. But most of his time was spent at Class A, as he played 21 games at Class AA and 3 games at Class AAA.</p>
        <p>So Pujols essentially jumped from Class A to the majors when he made the roster with the Cardinals this season, in part because of his versatility. The combination of hitting and versatility made Pujols an excellent asset for Manager Tony La Russa; Pujols appeared in 43 games at first base, 55 at third base and 78 in the outfield.</p>
        <p>Pujols even had his own Suzuki story as he recounted how Suzuki, the first Japanese-born position player in the majors, approached him at the All-Star Game and told him he was a great hitter.</p>
        <p>''I'm excited, I'm glad; it's a blessed year,'' Pujols said. ''This is a pretty good honor. You can only win it one year. I'm honored I got it.''</p>
        <p>Unlike the confident, slightly embarrassed Suzuki, who expected to follow closer Kazuhiro Sasaki, his teammate and countryman, in winning the award, Pujols said, ''Winning the rookie of the year, I never thought that was going to happen.''</p>
        <p>The Mariners paid $13.1 million for the rights to negotiate with Suzuki and then signed him to a three-year, $14 million contract. It was a significant investment to make on a player who had never appeared in a regular-season game in the majors, but the Mariners were quite familiar with Suzuki because he had participated in spring training with them and had established himself as the premier player in Japan.</p>
        <p>Less than a month into the season, the Yankees' Derek Jeter marveled at Suzuki's speed and bat control, saying, ''He hits a grounder to short and he's halfway up the line to beat it out.''</p>
        <p>Suzuki antagonized infielders and pitchers in helping the Mariners win an A.L. record 116 games. He proved to be one of the best players in the league and was easily the best first-year player. ''I'm not surprised at all with the results,'' Suzuki said. ''To be honest with you, if I won this award, I had wanted to win unanimously.''</p>
        <p>BASEBALL  Correction:  November 24, 2001, Saturday  A sports article on Nov. 13 about the choice of Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners as the American League rookie of the year referred incorrectly to his accomplishment in leading the league in batting average and stolen bases. He was the first rookie ever to lead both categories, not merely since 1949. Jackie Robinson, the previous player to achieve the feat, did so in 1949, two years after his rookie season.</p>
