        <p>Prime Minister Tony Blair's government asked Parliament today for emergency powers to permit the detention without trial of foreigners suspected of terrorism.</p>
        <p>Home Secretary David Blunkett submitted an order to the House of Commons declaring Britain to be in a ''state of public emergency'' and therefore entitled under European law to opt out of restrictions on such detentions in the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
        <p>Under Article 15 of the convention, governments are permitted to ask for exceptions in times of war or national emergency. The step today was a preliminary one that will enable Mr. Blunkett to introduce wide-ranging antiterror legislation on Tuesday that Britain hopes to rush through Parliament by year's end.</p>
        <p>Among the provisions would be a crackdown on supporters in Britain who conspire with terrorists abroad or assist them, new requirements on airlines to supply information about passengers and freight, tighter security at airports and an extension of laws against inciting racial hatred to include religious hatred.</p>
        <p>The detention provision is aimed at people whose activities have aroused suspicions but who cannot be taken into custody or deported under existing law. Officials said the law would initially be directed at 20 people who were living here and were wanted on terror charges abroad, but could not be sent for trial because British human rights laws forbid extradition to countries that use torture or the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blunkett said the measure was intended to prevent terror attacks, a growing preoccupation here because of the nation's robust support for the American-led coalition and the presence of British troops on the ground in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>''I am determined to protect this country from anyone who is prepared to abuse our hospitality and welcome in order to plan or promote terrorism here or abroad,'' Mr. Blunkett said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Under the proposed law, Mr. Blunkett would issue a certificate to declare the foreigner to be a threat to national security. The person would have the right to appeal to a Special Immigration Appeals Commission. The appeal would be heard by a three-judge panel in sessions closed to the public and the press, and suspects would have no right to judicial review except on narrow points of law. The commission would review the detention every six months.</p>
        <p>Human rights groups expressed objections to the proposal, comparing it to similar restrictions on Iraqis in Britain during the gulf war, Germans in World War II and Irish Catholics 30 years ago. The policy of internment, officially used in Northern Ireland from 1971 to 1975 and responsible for detaining 1,981 people, all but 107 of whom were Roman Catholics, was widely viewed as an abuse that ended up creating more anti-British Irish republicans.</p>
        <p>John Wadham, director of Liberty, a civil liberties group, said he would challenge the new law in court as ''a fundamental violation of the rule of law, our rights and traditional British values.''</p>
        <p>Sadiq Khan, a human rights lawyer, said, ''There is concern that this power will be used disproportionately against those who appear to be and are visible Muslims.''</p>
        <p>The opposition Conservatives said they would back Mr. Blunkett's proposals but complained that they did not go far enough. ''Mr. Blunkett's internment plan is a poor substitute for a truly effective plan to prevent suspected terrorists from entering the U.K. in the first place and for removing them swiftly once they are here,'' said Oliver Letwin, the party's law enforcement spokesman.</p>
