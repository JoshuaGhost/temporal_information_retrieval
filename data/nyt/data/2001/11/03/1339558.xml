        <p>Unemployment in Canada reached its highest level in two years last month, climbing to 7.3 percent from 7.2 percent in September. The number of jobs was little changed, but there was a marked shift from full-time to part-time employment. Regionally, October's jobless rate varied from 4.5 percent in Alberta, where oil and natural gas activity has buoyed business, to almost 16 percent in Newfoundland. Canada's economy has been at a virtual standstill since last spring, with Statistics Canada this week reporting an insignificant, 0.1 percent rise in gross domestic product in August. The weak economy and low commodity prices have pushed the Canadian dollar down sharply.</p>
