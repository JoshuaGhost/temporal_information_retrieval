        <p>The day before the World Series began, Curt Schilling dismissed the notion that the Yankees were some supernaturally special team. ''When you use the words mystique and aura,'' Schilling, the Arizona pitcher, said, ''those are dancers in a nightclub. Those are not things we concern ourselves with on the ball field.''</p>
        <p>After watching the Yankees win two games in 25 hours after being one out away from losing each game, Schilling was asked again what he thought about mystique and aura. ''I didn't know they'd make an appearance at Yankee Stadium,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever it is that propels the Yankees to these types of victories -- pure talent, opportunism or otherworldly elements -- they have, in the last six years, become the best team in baseball history.</p>
        <p>Maybe it would be wise to wait until the Yankees won the Series with a victory Saturday night or Sunday night, but even if they were to lose both games, the reputation they have forged would not be tarnished greatly. The Yankees have simply gone beyond other teams, including their ancestors, who won five and four World Series in a row.</p>
        <p>Those teams became World Series champions by winning four postseason games. In each of their four championship seasons in the previous five years, the Yankees have won 11 games. They have beaten three teams, not just one. They have gone an astounding 44-12 in those games.</p>
        <p>To learn the difference in the degree of difficulty, ask the Atlanta Braves. Despite a sports-record 10 straight division titles, the Braves navigated the rocky shoals of the playoffs only once. The other nine times the Braves fell in one of the first two rounds before the World Series or in the Series itself.</p>
        <p>In the last six years, the Yankees have lost only one of 15 postseason series. They are one victory from making that one of 16. It is a mind-boggling record. Even more remarkable has been the way the Yankees have won many of the games. The last two at Yankee Stadium are only the latest example.</p>
        <p>Down by two runs with two outs in the ninth inning in each instance, the Yankees struck with stunning swiftness and prevented the Diamondbacks from flying home without the need of a plane.</p>
        <p>''We were one out away two times in a row, so we were two outs away from being world champs,'' Arizona's Mark Grace said.</p>
        <p>Asked if the Diamondbacks allowed themselves to think how easily they could have already won the World Series, Luis Gonzalez said: ''Well, sure. We were talking about it earlier. But it didn't happen. That's not the scenario that the movie script has writ out for us.''</p>
        <p>Albie Lopez, the losing pitcher in Game 5, has seen the Yankees during the regular season as a pitcher for Cleveland and Tampa Bay. He said the Yankees' victories in the last two games were surprising.</p>
        <p>''You're very surprised because you're not expecting something out of the ordinary, especially in the postseason,'' he said. ''When something like that happens, it's out of the ordinary.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees, however, have made winning ordinary. They have become the masters of the one-run victory. They won Games 3, 4 and 5 by one run each. The first three of their four victories over the Mets in last year's Series were by a run each. When they rallied in 1996 from a two-games-to-none deficit, they beat the Braves in Games 6 and 7 by a run each.</p>
        <p>Are the Yankees good enough to score just enough runs to win?</p>
        <p>''There's a reason why they're four-time world champions in the past five years,'' Schilling said. ''When they had to make plays and score runs, they did. That's why we're at where we're at right now.''</p>
        <p>Playing the Yankees, Grace said, has been educational. ''Having played these rascals, you realize why they're so good in the American League,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As the Diamondbacks' general manager, Joe Garagiola Jr. has a different perspective from his players, but he sees the same attributes.</p>
        <p>''Individually and as a team,'' he said, ''they have a belief that you never give away any outs, that until the other guys put 27 outs on the board, you're still playing. Mystique, aura, tradition, ghosts, whatever you want to call it, it's a group of good players who I'm guessing don't have to be told or reminded that you can't run the clock out in this game. As long as there are still some lights on the scoreboard, you can win any game.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees, Garagiola added, don't give up an at-bat or do anything with indifference. ''There's an intensity first to last,'' he said. ''Do you have to play perfectly to beat the Yankees? No. Do you have to be opportunistic? Yes. The last couple of games we weren't sufficiently opportunistic. We had opportunities to score more runs, but we didn't. If you don't, these guys are right there waiting for you.''</p>
        <p>The Diamondbacks were happy to be leaving Yankee Stadium early this morning. ''If I see this place again, it will be too soon; this place is a tough place to win,'' Grace said. Gonzalez said, ''They did some magical things here the last two nights.''</p>
        <p>They were happy to be going home and to have Randy Johnson pitching in Game 6. ''I would look for another close game,'' Grace said, ''and hopefully we can get that 27th out.''</p>
        <p>The Diamondbacks have to hope that the Yankees didn't invite Mystique and Aura to fly their charter here today.</p>
