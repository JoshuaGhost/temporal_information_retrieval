        <p>On Sept. 11, as schoolchildren across the country learned of the attack on the twin towers, there was a rush of students in Jerry Kerne's sixth-grade class asking to go to the bathroom. Actually, they just wanted to look out the hall window and see the smoking towers for themselves.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, some children in Mr. Kerne's class, at Public School 20 on the Lower East Side, recalled worrying that day that loved ones were dead, and that an attack might happen at their school. Others reported more recent concerns, like fear of reprisals against Muslim students and fear about the continuing war on terrorism. ''If we settle it with war, they're going to get angry and want to destroy New York more,'' said Alia Nicole Jimenez, 11.</p>

        <p>On Sept. 11, as schoolchildren across the country learned of the attack on the twin towers, there was a rush of students in Jerry Kerne's sixth-grade class asking to go to the bathroom. Actually, they just wanted to look out the hall window and see the smoking towers for themselves.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, some children in Mr. Kerne's class, at Public School 20 on the Lower East Side, recalled worrying that day that loved ones were dead, and that an attack might happen at their school. Others reported more recent concerns, like fear of reprisals against Muslim students and fear about the continuing war on terrorism. ''If we settle it with war, they're going to get angry and want to destroy New York more,'' said Alia Nicole Jimenez, 11.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerne's class is one of the first to participate in an after-school program that is supported in part with money from The New York Times  9/11 Neediest Fund.</p>
        <p>The fund has given $800,000 to the After-School Corporation, a nonprofit agency, to run the program at several schools south of Houston Street, including P.S. 20, where 14 children lost immediate family members in the attack and two lost relatives in the crash of Flight 587.</p>
        <p>''The after-school program helps kids by giving them a safe and secure place to express anxieties, dreams, hopes,'' said Lucy Friedman, president of the After-School Corporation. ''What we're seeing in our programs -- which are small, with one adult for 10 kids -- is one that when the world is seeming so rattled and out of control, kids know they can come to a place they can control.''</p>
        <p>To date, the 9/11 Neediest Fund has received $46.8 million in donations. Of that, $8.7 million has been given to 10 social service agencies that use the money to provide direct relief to families and individuals affected by the attack on the trade center.</p>
        <p>''We must be seeing a tenfold increase compared to our normal rates of direct relief assistance,'' said David R. Jones, chief executive of the Community Service Society of New York, one of the 10 agencies.</p>
        <p>He said the agency had been providing $100,000 a week in assistance with rent, utility bills, mortgages, food and clothing.</p>
        <p>The 9/11 Neediest Fund has also spent nearly $5.4 million on various initiatives to improve the quality of life for those affected by the attack. The largest of those grants was $1.5 million to a program that assists small-business owners in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>In addition, $775,000 has been given to the New York Consortium for Effective Trauma Treatment for a program that began yesterday to increase the number of mental health professionals in New York and Washington trained to deal with post-traumatic stress.</p>
        <p>The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund, has received 50 written proposals from groups interested in obtaining grants from the 9/11 Neediest Fund, and has made 20 grants, including $100,000 to the Columbia Center for Children's Environmental Health.</p>
        <p>The center is planning to conduct blood tests on the umbilical cords of 300 babies born to women who while pregnant were exposed to the air around ground zero. The center, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, plans to analyze the samples to search for a range of pollutants.</p>
        <p>''There is evidence that women who were pregnant at the time of the Sept. 11 tragedy are more susceptible to certain kinds of toxic exposures,'' said Dr. Frederica Perera, the center's director. ''We want to be able to provide additional data to the air-monitoring data, to place reassurances where appropriate. Hopefully that's what we'll be doing.''</p>
        <p>Large grants that have been made by the 9/11 Neediest Fund include:</p>
        <p>* $350,000 to United Neighborhood Houses, which will be used at eight settlement houses that assist poor people living in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>* $300,000 each to the Legal Aid Society and Legal Services New York, to provide help to poor families.</p>
        <p>* $175,000 to New York University Downtown Hospital, the closest hospital to ground zero, to help the hospital continue to treat field workers, residents and local employees.</p>
        <p>* $50,000 each to City Harvest and City Meals-on-Wheels to help them meet the added costs of their programs to feed the poor.</p>
