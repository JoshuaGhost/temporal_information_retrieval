        <p>Skunk Versus Dog</p>
        <p>Q.  Does anything work better than tomato juice to deodorize a dog sprayed by a skunk?</p>
        <p>A.  A formula developed by Paul Krebaum, a materials engineer in Lisle, Ohio, has been hailed by pet lovers as an effective remedy for the tenacious odors left in animal hair by oily sulfur compounds, called thiols, found in skunk spray. It works by oxidizing, or adding oxygen, to the thiols; the resulting compounds are not volatile and cannot be smelled.</p>

        <p>Skunk Versus Dog</p>
        <p>Q.  Does anything work better than tomato juice to deodorize a dog sprayed by a skunk?</p>
        <p>A.  A formula developed by Paul Krebaum, a materials engineer in Lisle, Ohio, has been hailed by pet lovers as an effective remedy for the tenacious odors left in animal hair by oily sulfur compounds, called thiols, found in skunk spray. It works by oxidizing, or adding oxygen, to the thiols; the resulting compounds are not volatile and cannot be smelled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krebaum developed the formula while working on ''scrubbing gas streams in the lab so they would not go up the hood and annoy people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The mixture must be made in a large, open container because it foams so much that it could explode a closed vessel, and cannot be stored. It contains a quart of 3 percent hydrogen peroxide, a quarter cup of baking soda (bicarbonate of soda) and a teaspoon of liquid soap. (Mr. Krebaum recommends Soft Soap or Ivory.)</p>
        <p>Work it well into the hair or fur of the victim, avoiding the eyes; while the formula is nontoxic, the salt from the baking soda will  sting. Let it sit long enough to work -- ''Let your nose be your guide,'' Mr. Krebaum said -- then rinse it thoroughly.</p>
        <p>A longer application, or a second one, may be needed, especially for an old attack that has had time to work its way into the hair shaft. The long-lasting thiol acetates cause the persistent odors and may start working again, especially if the pet gets wet.</p>
