        <p>Article on hundreds of little-known foreigners who were swept up in vast dragnet after Sept 11 terrorist attacks focuses on Yael Antebi, Israeli tourist who was taken from her Columbia, Mo, apartment and detained in jail in Kansas City because her tourist visa prohibited employment in US, offense that, in normal times, rarely results in detention; Antebi was detained for few days; photo (M)</p>

        <p>At 2:30 a.m. after Halloween night, when she heard the knock on the door at her Columbia, Mo., apartment, Yael Antebi was on the phone, calling her father in Israel, where it was morning.</p>
        <p>Her father didn't have time to answer before Ms. Antebi, 21, was arrested by immigration agents, taken to Kansas City and put in jail there. Ms. Antebi came to the United States in late September to visit her boyfriend, and the two of them, like dozens of other young Israelis here, had found work selling plastic toy helicopters and puzzles in shopping mall kiosks.</p>
        <p>While her immigration papers were valid, Ms. Antebi was detained because her tourist visa prohibited employment, an offense that, in normal times, rarely results in detention. She was not alone. Around the country, at least 70 other young Israelis, including her boyfriend, have been detained on similar charges.</p>
        <p>It was an anxious time for Ms. Antebi's parents, who live near Haifa; they got the message that their daughter had called, but all day, whenever they tried to call back, there was no answer.</p>
        <p>''We were very worried,'' said her mother, Uta Antebi. ''And then when she was able to call us, late the next day, we were very upset to find out that she was in jail.'' Ms. Antebi was worried, too. ''I was never arrested before,'' she said. . ''I had never been in jail. The people were nice to us, but it's a scary situation. Everyone said it wouldn't be very long, but as the days went on, we got more and more worried.''</p>
        <p>The logistics of calling her family in Israel made matters more complicated. Detainees were only allowed to make collect calls within the United States. For Ms. Antebi, the only route to her parents was through Yoav Cohen, a New York relative, who would arrange a conference call.</p>
        <p>''Yoav and my parents were great, and did everything they could to help,'' she said. ''I was lucky. They got me a lawyer, and I was released Monday. The sad thing is, my boyfriend is still in there, and there's nothing I can do to help him.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Antebi has agreed to go back to Israel, and she expects to leave next week. She is eager to see her parents and her two younger brothers, one of whom just went into the army.</p>
        <p>''When I got out, and I called, I told him, this is the one moment in your life when you go into the military, and here I am, getting all the attention,'' she said. ''I really hope my boyfriend is out by the time I leave.''</p>
