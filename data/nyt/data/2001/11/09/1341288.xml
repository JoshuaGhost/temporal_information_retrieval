        <p>House Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement on a bill to overhaul the nation's election system, providing $2.25 billion to the states over three years for new equipment and registration systems and an extra $400 million to buy out old punch-card voting machines.</p>
        <p>The measure would also reduce the postage rates for official election mail, to encourage states to provide voters with sample ballots.</p>
        <p>The Senate is working on a similar bill. Although the Senate is far apart at the moment, the House action raises the serious prospect for the first time since last year's election troubles in Florida that Congress could give President Bush an election-reform bill before year's end.</p>
        <p>Representatives Bob Ney, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Administration Committee, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the committee's ranking Democrat, emerged with an agreement on Wednesday night after months of negotiations.</p>
        <p>The crucial feature of the bill is that it would provide money to the states to help overhaul their systems if the states met the following minimum standards: provided a centralized database for voter registration; offered provisional voting, in which a person could vote even if his eligibility was in doubt, with the vote counting later if the eligibility is verified; provided a system for accurately maintaining voter registration records; adopted uniform standards defining what constitutes a vote for each of the different kinds of voting machines in the state; ensured that absentee ballots from people overseas and those in the military are counted; and required that new voting systems provide ''a practical and effective means'' for voters with disabilities to cast ballots in secret.</p>
        <p>The bill would provide $1 billion next year, $750 million in 2003 and $500 million in 2004 to help the states meet these standards and buy new equipment. The federal government would pay 75 percent of the costs,  with states paying the rest.</p>
        <p>It would also provide $400 million in time for the 2002 elections to buy out punchcard systems, which were used by one-third of the nation's voters in 2000.</p>
