        <p>In a bustling room on Willis Avenue in the South Bronx, a boy was enjoying his first day in pottery class. He smiled as he rounded the edges of a coiled snake.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the boy started to cry, and dropped the clay snake as if it had bit him. In a way, it had.</p>
        <p>As he smoothed the clay, Federico Gonzalez, 13, flashed back to the sweet days in Puebla, Mexico, when he and his father fetched clay from caves, or ''mud mines'' as the locals called them, to make pottery pieces they would sell on the streets. The pottery business put food on the table, and a special bond was molded between father and son.</p>
        <p>For little Federico, then 6, pottery was fun. For his family, it was fruitless. ''Federico cried because he thought back to those days with his father,'' days that he misses very much, said his mother, Mary Gonzalez. ''But life was so difficult back there, we just had to leave,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Our family would sell about 100 pieces of pottery per week. And when we counted our pesos, we made the equivalent of 20 American dollars -- it was terrible.''</p>
        <p>So in February 1994, seven members of Mrs. Gonzalez's family --  herself, her husband, three daughters and two sons -- left the mud mines for the United States, but their long road to a new beginning seems to have no end. ''We don't have any legal papers here,'' Mrs. Gonzalez said, ''so it's hard for me and my husband to get good jobs.''</p>
        <p>Raymundo, her husband, earns $5.50 an hour as a dishwasher for a catering hall, but parties have been scarce since Sept. 11, and Raymundo's hours have been severely cut. Mrs. Gonzalez helps by selling mangos and oranges near the family's tiny apartment in the summer, and homemade specialties, like rice pudding and tamales, in the winter.</p>
        <p>As she spoke, Mrs. Gonzalez smiled at Federico, who was sneaking peeks at his mother from a seat at Abraham House, an alternative to prison that provides transitional housing for former convicts, as well as counseling and day care services for their families.</p>
        <p>Two of Mrs. Gonzalez's daughters are married with children, and each of their husbands has spent time in prison. That brought the Gonzalez family to Abraham House, which is run by Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.</p>
        <p>''When this family came to us, they couldn't read or write in either English or Spanish,'' said Sister Simone Ponnet, the executive director of Abraham House. ''And most people who can't read don't keep calendars, so the kids didn't even know when their birthdays were -- we had to guess their ages, and give them birthdays.''</p>
        <p>Besides Federico, Mrs. Gonzalez also takes her daughter, Catalina, 10; her son, Antonio, 9; and two grandchildren to Abraham House every day after school. They are among 27 children, ages 3 to 13, who gather there each weekday to have lunch, do their homework, work and play on computers and share in other activities.</p>
        <p>The Gonzalezes live nearby with three other family members in a one-bedroom apartment on the fifth floor of a dilapidated tenement.</p>
        <p>Inside the cluttered apartment, Catalina's bed is nothing more than four old sofa cushions strung together on the cold tile floor, though Abraham House will soon provide a bunk bed for her and Antonio. ''Without the kind sisters from Abraham House,'' Mrs. Gonzalez said, ''life here wouldn't be much better for us than it was in Mexico.''</p>
