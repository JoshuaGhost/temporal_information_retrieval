        <p>A plywood and plexiglass dance floor set on top of a motel swimming pool collapsed early yesterday, injuring more than 50 partygoers who plunged into the water, the police said. The most serious injuries were concussions and deep cuts that were not life threatening, officials said. The incident occurred about 2:15 a.m. at the Ramada Inn. Several hundred people may have been on the dance floor, the police said. No arrests have been made, and the incident is still under investigation. Officials for Metro Lounge, the party's organizer, did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
