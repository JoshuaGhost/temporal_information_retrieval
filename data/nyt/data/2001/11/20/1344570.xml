        <p>It has always been strange, walking back and forth across the bottom of the East River in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes,'' Frank Ortiz says, ''you can hear the tugboats, going by above you.''</p>
        <p>The 53rd Street river tunnel, which runs between Manhattan and Queens, seems like something Dante imagined for the Inferno, the place where every kind of sin has a special punishment.</p>
        <p>But looking down the river tunnel, it is hard to figure out what the sin might be. It is dark. There are things to slip on, like decomposing rats. Every 10 or 15 minutes, a train thunders through, leaving little room to get out of its way.</p>
        <p>When the train is gone, there is still the third rail, with its 600 volts.</p>
        <p>And if something really bad happens, the only way out is to run to one end of the tunnel or the other. This means that safety is more than half a mile away, in either direction, if you are in the middle.</p>
        <p>''Basically, you kiss yourself goodbye,'' said Mr. Ortiz, who has thought about this.</p>
        <p>He has been a subway track inspector for more than 10 years. His job began to get stranger after the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, when the police realized that an attack in a river tunnel could spread destruction far beyond the subway: It would probably flood a lot of Manhattan, not to mention Brooklyn or Queens.</p>
        <p>So in addition to looking for cracks in rails and concrete, which are dangerous enough, Mr. Ortiz and his co-workers were deputized to look for even more dangerous things, like boxes and bags and people who are not supposed to be hanging out at the bottom of the East River.</p>
        <p>Now, after the Sept. 11 attack, the tunnel inspectors feel as if the place where they work has become as strategically important as a nuclear missile silo.</p>
        <p>To get into the river tubes, past the police officers now posted at both ends of all of them, the inspectors must show not only work identification but a driver's license. A log is also kept by transit officials, so that the police know exactly how many people are in the tubes at all times, and who they are.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortiz and his buddies find this a little funny. ''There's nobody in the innards of the subway except us,'' said Chris Fee, a track worker. ''Not the cops. Not the firemen. Nobody. We don't even want to be down there.''</p>
        <p>But behind the veneer of humor, even the toughest track workers worry more now about finding something or someone down there with them.</p>
        <p>River tunnels, buried beneath mud and water, do not seem to be the kind of shining towers of American might that would attract terrorists. But considered another way, they are just horizontal towers. And if they collapsed, it could cripple the city much more effectively than falling skyscrapers have.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortiz and co-workers were talking about this just before dawn the other morning, as the overnight shift ended and they sat in their locker room at Columbus Circle, changing out of their tunnel clothes, coated in steel dust.</p>
        <p>It is the kind of locker room you might expect for guys who work all night in such a lonely and dismal place.</p>
        <p>There is a centerfold of Shannen Doherty, partially clad, on a locker door. There is a faded sign on the wall that reads, ''I'm only laughing 'cause you're my boss.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ortiz -- whose full first name is Francisco, but who is often called Fidel because of his love for Toro Bravo cigars -- explained the nomenclature of the track worker.</p>
        <p>Tunnels are not the things that run between regular stations. Those long empty spaces are simply called ''the hole.'' Tunnels are the things that run under the river, except that these are more often called tubes. In other words, there are no tunnels.</p>
        <p>But whatever they are called and as desolate as they may be, Mr. Ortiz and the others are proud that they are their domain. ''Those guys are the eyes and ears down there,'' said John Samuelsen, the transit union official who represents them.</p>
        <p>The workers remembered the time in the mid-1990's when the police were after a suspected rapist in Brooklyn and the man dashed into ''the hole.'' The track workers led the chase into the darkness, with the police following.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the only places in the city where cops and firefighters can't go on their own,'' John Tercovich, a track welder, said. ''They don't know where they're going. And we're the only ones who know where people could hide.''</p>
        <p>This is because the track workers have come across all manner of humanity in the subway over the years. Like the homeless man who liked to sit at a Y in the tracks, in a lawn chair, with a battery-powered light, reading The Wall Street Journal. Or the one who was sometimes seen wearing white Nikes and a baseball cap and nothing else.</p>
        <p>Coming across that guy in the middle of the night could make the terrors of terrorism seem relative, the workers said.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of hard down there,'' Paul Mondiello, a track worker, said, ''to equate what's more dangerous than what else.''</p>
