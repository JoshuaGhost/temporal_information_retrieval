        <p>Federal prosecutors are weighing whether to seek a conspiracy indictment against a man in custody in New York who the authorities suspect was the 20th suicide hijacker in the Sept. 11 terror attacks, senior law enforcement officials said today.</p>
        <p>The man, Zacarias Moussaoui, a 33-year-old French citizen of Moroccan descent, was arrested in Minneapolis on Aug. 17 on immigration charges after he sought lessons on how to fly Boeing jets, but expressed no interest in learning how to take off or land.</p>
        <p>Since shortly after Sept. 11, Mr. Moussaoui has been held in New York as a material witness, but he has repeatedly refused to answer investigators' questions.</p>
        <p>''We still have questions about him, but so far we don't have a direct connection'' to the attacks, one senior law enforcement official said today. The official said it was unclear what specific charges might be brought against Mr. Moussaoui, but added that various charges were being considered.</p>
        <p>Another senior government official said tonight that one possible charge against Mr. Moussaoui was ''seditious conspiracy to levy war against the United States.'' The possibility of an indictment against Mr. Moussaoui was first reported today in The Boston Globe.</p>
        <p>Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have said in court documents that that charge is among the offenses being investigated by the grand jury looking into the attacks. The potential charge in this case was also mentioned in a perjury indictment on Nov. 1 of a Jordanian student who was living in San Diego and was charged with lying about his relationship with the suspected hijacker Khalid al-Midhar. It was also a charge used in terrorism cases in the 1990's, including the case against Sheik Abdel Rahman, who was convicted of conspiring to blow up the World Trade Center in 1993.</p>
        <p>Some senior law enforcement officials want to make Mr. Moussaoui the first person to be indicted on charges of taking part in the conspiracy that led to the Sept. 11 attacks. One senior law enforcement official said tonight that he believed a grand jury would charge Mr. Moussaoui with being involved.</p>
        <p>But other senior law enforcement officials said today that there was  not much more than circumstantial evidence linking Mr. Moussaoui to the plot.</p>
        <p>A review of Mr. Moussaoui's telephone records has not revealed a hard link to the 19 suspected hijackers or their associates, officials have said. But the German authorities have said that Mr. Moussaoui had at least one telephone conversation with the landlord of an apartment rented by Mohamed Atta, who is considered by investigators to be the ringleader of the hijacking plot.</p>
        <p>Although no important evidence has emerged about Mr. Moussaoui's role, investigators say he fits the profile of most of the 19 hijackers: a well-educated immigrant with deep ties to Muslim extremists who had sought flight training in the United States.</p>
        <p>Some officials have said they suspect Mr. Moussaoui was meant to be aboard United Airlines Flight 93, which crashed in a field in Stony Township, Pa., after the passengers apparently stormed the cockpit and attacked the hijackers. Federal authorities have said that of the four hijacked airliners, only Flight 93 had four hijackers aboard instead of the five-man teams on the other three flights.</p>
        <p>The authorities have also noted some important differences between Mr. Moussaoui and the other hijackers. He enrolled in flight school this spring, while the others had trained on large aircraft simulators for a year or more before the hijackings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moussaoui came to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Minneapolis in August after an instructor at the Pan Am Flying Academy in Eagan, Minn., called the authorities to report that a new foreign student had behaved suspiciously.</p>
