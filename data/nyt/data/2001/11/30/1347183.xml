        <p>Cable and Wireless is close to a deal to pay more than $500 million to acquire the assets of Exodus Communications, the once-highflying Web site operating company that filed for bankruptcy-law protection this fall, executives close to the talks said yesterday.</p>
        <p>A deal could be announced as early as today, the executives said.</p>
        <p>If approved by Exodus, the acquisition would be the most ambitious move into the United States by Cable and Wireless of Britain. Executives said that Cable and Wireless had been interested in Exodus even before its bankruptcy filing.</p>
        <p>Cable and Wireless acquired Digital Island, a smaller Internet company, earlier this year as part of an effort to increase sales of data services to businesses.</p>
        <p>If Cable and Wireless succeeds in acquiring the assets of Exodus, it would gain control of more than 40 data centers in North America, Europe and Asia. Before seeking bankruptcy protection in September, Exodus was the world's largest Web site operating company.</p>
        <p>Exodus focuses on clients whose businesses are heavily dependent on the Internet, like electronic-commerce companies and operators of news Web sites.</p>
        <p>Exodus, based in Santa Clara, Calif., expanded rapidly in the late 1990's and 2000 only to see its prospects deteriorate after the collapse of the dot-coms.</p>
        <p>In September, when Exodus filed for bankruptcy protection, it disclosed that it had received $200 million in financing from GE Capital.</p>
        <p>Cable and Wireless will not take on any of the $4.4 billion in liabilities and debt of Exodus, the executives said.</p>
