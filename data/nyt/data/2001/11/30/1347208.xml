        <p>The record-breaking quarterback from California had never heard of the school before it recruited him. The fullback is a poet who hopes to publish a book of his work. The star wide receiver is a former member of the basketball team who had not played football since his junior year in high school. And one of the starting defensive ends had initially gone to Kansas to play football, only to wind up on an undefeated team 60 miles from his hometown of Neptune, N.J.</p>
        <p>Justin Holtfreter, Brandon Graham, DeVeren Johnson, all seniors, and the junior Shaun Hubbard are part of the mix of players who have helped turn around the Sacred Heart football team. The Pioneers, with a 10-0 record, are now preparing for the ECAC Bowl against Duquesne on Saturday in Pittsburgh. Sacred Heart, which plays in Division I-AA, won the Northeast Conference championship, while Duquesne, 8-2, qualified by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference title.</p>

        <p>The record-breaking quarterback from California had never heard of the school before it recruited him. The fullback is a poet who hopes to publish a book of his work. The star wide receiver is a former member of the basketball team who had not played football since his junior year in high school. And one of the starting defensive ends had initially gone to Kansas to play football, only to wind up on an undefeated team 60 miles from his hometown of Neptune, N.J.</p>
        <p>Justin Holtfreter, Brandon Graham, DeVeren Johnson, all seniors, and the junior Shaun Hubbard are part of the mix of players who have helped turn around the Sacred Heart football team. The Pioneers, with a 10-0 record, are now preparing for the ECAC Bowl against Duquesne on Saturday in Pittsburgh. Sacred Heart, which plays in Division I-AA, won the Northeast Conference championship, while Duquesne, 8-2, qualified by winning the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference title.</p>
        <p>Before Coach Jim Fleming arrived in 2000, Sacred Heart had had eight consecutive losing seasons, including 2-8 and 2-9 in 1998 and 1999. But Fleming is too modest and too smart to think that this remarkable turnaround resulted solely from his coaching abilities.</p>
        <p>''The talent was already here when I arrived,'' said Fleming who came to Sacred Heart after spending 15 years as an assistant coach at South Carolina, Boise State, Brown, East Carolina and Villanova. ''I inherited a group of kids who were hungry and looking to be led. We were just missing a couple of pieces.''</p>
        <p>With five of those pieces coming from California to a predominantly East Coast roster, Fleming and some of his eight assistants assembled the rest between the time he was hired in January 2000 and the start of last season. The gem was Holtfreter, who played two seasons at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster, Calif., and was recruited on the basis of a tape Fleming requested after he heard about Holtfreter's passing prowess. Last season, the 5-foot-11, 215-pound Holtfreter broke seven Sacred Heart passing records, and he has broken most of those this season, including most completions (155 of 275, with only 7 interceptions), most touchdown passes (23) and most passing yards (2,369).</p>
        <p>Hubbard, the 6-3, 240-pound defensive end from New Jersey, spent two seasons at Fort Scott Community College in Kansas before coming back east. Another New Jerseyan, running back Marvin Royal of Pleasantville, transferred to Sacred Heart last year from nearby Fairfield University. The 5-10, 210-pound Royal has shattered some of the Pioneers' offensive records this season -- many of which he set in 2000 -- including most touchdowns in a season (16).</p>
        <p>The biggest surprise, though, has been the 6-6, 225-pound Johnson, from San Diego, who set two receiving records last season and several more this year, including receptions (48), receiving touchdowns (13) and receiving yardage (1,091). A transfer from Champlain College in Vermont, Johnson was recruited to play basketball at Sacred Heart. He did, for one season as a starting forward, averaging 12.3 points, but then quit the team because of differences with the coach.</p>
        <p>''He came to see me and told me he wanted to switch over to football, even though he hadn't played the game in a long time,'' said Fleming, who admitted he was concerned about Johnson's attitude and work ethic. ''I knew he had tremendous athletic ability, and he's done everything we've asked while maturing as a person.''</p>
        <p>Fleming said that four N.F.L. teams have scouted Johnson. ''He's a legitimate pro prospect,'' Fleming said, ''and he's going to get better.''</p>
        <p>Graham, the 6-foot, 225-pound fullback and a tricaptain, is the soul and poetic center of the team. The lead blocker for Royal, he has not only opened holes on the field for his star tailback but also in Royal's mind. ''Through Brandon, I got interested in poetry,'' Royal said, ''and am working with him and a teammate, David Carlor, on a book of poetry.''</p>
        <p>That is a more legitimate goal for Graham, who has had a number of poems printed in the student newspaper, the Spectrum, and is currently trying to have a book of about 60 of his poems published under the title ''A Love Supreme.'' Graham said he had written about 400 poems since his sophomore year at Crosby High School in Waterbury, Conn.</p>
        <p>''Most of my poems are based on love, religion and social issues,'' he said before practice on Tuesday. ''And at times, through my poetry, I try to raise the social conscience of an audience.''</p>
        <p>Can writing poetry and giving readings on campus and at schools in the Bridgeport area be beneficial to a player during Sacred Heart's best season ever? ''Yes, it can,'' Graham said. ''It's very therapeutic, and it helps me relax.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, it has helped raise the profile of one of college football's few undefeated teams as it prepares for its last game of the season.</p>
