        <p>When people in health maintenance organizations are allowed to see specialists whenever they want to, without being referred by a primary care physician, they do not flock to the specialists' offices, a new study has found.</p>
        <p>The research, being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, found no overall increase in visits to specialists when Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a health maintenance organization in Massachusetts, reversed its policy and allowed such visits without referrals. The only significant change  was a very small increase in first visits to specialists, especially for low back pain.</p>
        <p>Requiring that a primary care doctor authorize visits to specialists, known as gatekeeping, was instituted in the 1980's and early 90's by many health insurers to control costs and overuse of specialists. Without authorization, such insurers will not pay for specialty care. In many companies, primary care physicians are paid less if they refer patients to specialists or hospital care.</p>
        <p>Gatekeeping, which affects about half of Americans in health care plans, has never been popular with patients or doctors, and in recent years many insurers, facing competition from organizations without gatekeepers, have relaxed or eliminated the need for referrals.</p>
        <p>For patients, gatekeeping can mean an extra doctor visit, a delay in needed care and a belief that the doctor cares more about costs than about the patient. For primary care doctors -- internists, family physicians, gynecologists and pediatricians -- gatekeeping adds to their patient load, paperwork and staff and, because the system often angers patients, increases the likelihood of malpractice suits.</p>
        <p>The lead author of the new study, Dr. Timothy G. Ferris of the Massachusetts General Hospital Institute for Health Policy in Boston, said, ''Because the cost and inconvenience of gatekeeping to physicians and patients are great, we may want to re-evaluate the policy.''</p>
        <p>Since the Harvard medical group began in 1969, patients were required to get referrals to nearly all specialists. Exceptions were made for dermatologists and mental health services and, starting in 1995, obstetrician-gynecologists.</p>
        <p>The gatekeeping requirement was dropped for all specialties in 1998.  The researchers found that the number of visits to specialists did not change.</p>
        <p>In an editorial accompanying the journal report, Dr. David Lawrence, chief executive officer of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan and Hospitals in Oakland, Calif., praised the study, but urged caution in broadly applying its findings unless some other mechanism is introduced to assure that patients receive appropriate and coordinated care.</p>
        <p>''At Kaiser Permanente, where I work, most patients are required to see a primary care physician when they seek care for the first time or for a new illness,'' Dr. Lawrence wrote. ''Once a patient is referred by a primary care physician to a specialist, no further referral is required for continued specialty care. The primary care physicians work in close collaboration with specialty services.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lawrence also wrote, ''Financial incentives are shared by the group as a whole, including specialists.'' He added that although Kaiser has what the study authors would call a gatekeeping system, it ''is part of an integrated approach to care.''</p>
        <p>However, at most only 5 percent of the population receives its health care from physicians in an integrated prepaid group practice like Harvard or Kaiser. In most managed care companies, which buy doctors' services, care is far more fragmented.</p>
        <p>Asked to comment about the new findings, Dr. William Roper, dean of the University of North Carolina School of Public Health and a former head of a managed care organization, said: ''I have no nostalgia for the gatekeeping method. No one is very comfortable with a 'Mother, may I' approach to health care. But tossing it out without an effective substitute is a problem. What's needed is an organized health care delivery system that, within limits, permits patients to have choices and at the same time makes efficient use of health care services. We can't go back to the Yellow Pages method of going to whomever you want to and getting whatever you want. That's crazy.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Roper said that in the mid-90's there was a stabilization of health care costs because of managed care, but because ''patient choice is perceived in this country as a God-given right, we've taken our foot off the brake and there's been a resurgence in rising health care costs.''</p>
