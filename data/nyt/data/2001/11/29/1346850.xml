        <p>After surveying the impasse here from the Palestinian perspective today, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni, the Bush administration's new envoy, declared, ''Both sides have suffered far too much in the last months.''</p>
        <p>''I think it is time for change,'' General Zinni told reporters after breaking the daily fast of Ramadan tonight with the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat. ''We need to end the violence and we need to get back on track toward peace.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat urged the American to draw up a specific timetable to march the parties back to negotiations.</p>
        <p>General Zinni, a newcomer to this conflict, has spent the last two days saying little and listening by turns to Israeli and Palestinian hosts as he begins the complex task of brokering a new cease-fire. After 10 months of letting the antagonists go their own ways, the Bush administration has now made peace here a priority as it tries to hold together a global coalition against terrorism.</p>
        <p>Colin L. Powell, the secretary of state, turned to General Zinni, who has retired from the Marine Corps, to coax the two sides to resume formal steps toward negotiations, steps they previously agreed upon. But the scope of General Zinni's mission and of his authority remain unclear to Israelis and Palestinians, who have expressed doubts about the possibility of a durable truce after 14 months of bitter conflict.</p>
        <p>Secretary Powell has said General Zinni would stay in the region ''for as long as it takes.''</p>
        <p>The retired general and Mr. Arafat met in Ramallah, in the West Bank. Shortly afterward, Palestinian gunmen again opened fire from the town of Beit Jala on a Jewish area of Jerusalem, Gilo, that they regard as an illegal settlement. Israeli forces returned fire.</p>
        <p>Late last month, Palestinian officials promised to prevent such shooting in exchange for a withdrawal by Israeli forces from positions they had occupied in Beit Jala, which is in Palestinian-controlled territory. That agreement appears to be unraveling.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, an Israeli settler driving in Nablus, in the West Bank, ran over and killed an elderly Palestinian man in what Palestinian witnesses called a deliberate attack. The Israeli police said it appeared to have been an accident.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday General Zinni surveyed Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip from a helicopter in a tour conducted by Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. During that tour, two Palestinian gunmen went on a shooting rampage through Afula, in northern Israel, killing 2 and seriously wounding 10. As medics tended to the injured, Mr. Sharon gave the general a bird's-eye view of the carnage.</p>
        <p>Today, General Zinni saw the West Bank from ground level on a tour conducted by United States diplomats. He had a look at the Israeli roadblocks of cement and dirt that cut off Palestinian towns and the settlements that Israelis have built since occupying the West Bank during the 1967 war.</p>
        <p>''I had the opportunity to see firsthand the difficulties presented to the Palestinians by the current situation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Under previously negotiated agreements, Israel is supposed to lift the blockade of Palestinian areas in exchange for a crackdown by Palestinian leaders on extremists.</p>
        <p>But each side argues that the other must make the first move. Israeli officials say they cannot remove the barriers until they can be confident that their citizens will be secure, while Palestinian officials say that they will not have the political strength to arrest militants until they can demonstrate that their citizens will gain tangible benefits.</p>
        <p>After meeting with General Zinni, Mr. Arafat called peace his ''strategic choice.'' He said that ''we are exerting and we will exert 100 percent of our efforts'' toward a just agreement, one that would create a Palestinian state alongside Israel.</p>
        <p>He held Israel responsible for the violence, pointing to an ''escalation of Israeli attacks, assassinations, siege and closures.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon blames Mr. Arafat for the violence. He has demanded seven days of ''absolute quiet'' before returning to the previously negotiated steps. Secretary Powell endorsed that condition in June, but Western diplomats say that the United States would settle for two to three days of calm. They say there is no point in confronting Mr. Sharon on this issue until some calm materializes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon is scheduled to depart Thursday night for the United States, where he plans to tour the World Trade Center with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani before meeting President Bush at the White House early next week. Mr. Bush has refused so far to meet with Mr. Arafat.</p>
