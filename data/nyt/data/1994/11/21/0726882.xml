        <p>When the Jets had to win, they produced their best game this season and their best game in Boomer Esiason's two seasons.</p>
        <p>But with first place in the American Conference East at stake next Sunday against the Miami Dolphins at "the Meadowlands," the Jets now must play that "best game" again in order for yesterday's 31-21 triumph over the Vikings to mean much.</p>
        <p>If the Jets win Sunday, they will be tied for first place with the Dolphins at 7-5 with four games remaining.</p>
        <p>Even if Buffalo wins its Thanksgiving Day game in Detroit for 7-5, the Jets will maintain their tie-breaker edge on the Bills because of their head-to-head 2-0 sweep.</p>
        <p>But in looking to next Sunday's game, this is a franchise that has usually had trouble winning big games it had to win or was supposed to win. Until yesterday.</p>
        <p>But yesterday the Jets didn't drop the ball. Literally.</p>
        <p>Maybe there were two or three passes their receivers didn't quite clutch to their chests, but when the ball had to be caught, it was caught. Of Esiason's 29 passes, 22 were caught, including 11 by tight end Johnny Mitchell for 120 yards. And of Warren Moon's 50 passes, 3 were caught by a virtually unknown Jets nickel back, Marcus Turner, including a 90-yard touchdown return.</p>
        <p>"I never had three interceptions in a game before," Turner was saying now. "Two, but never three."</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the Jets have won four of their last six games after a 2-0 start was derailed by an 0-3 slump.</p>
        <p>"We're just trying to get stronger for the playoffs," defensive tackle Donald Evans said. "I knew we had to win five out of our last six games, but now it's four out of our last five."</p>
        <p>Four out of five would create a 10-6 record, which might even be enough to win the A.F.C. East, a division separated by only two games from top to bottom.</p>
        <p>As much as the Jets are looking ahead to the Dolphins next Sunday, if the Jets lose for a 6-6 record, the winner of next Sunday night's New England-Indianapolis game will also be 6-6. And after next Sunday, the Jets go to New England, play the Detroit Lions and the San Diego Chargers at the Meadowlands, then finish the season on Christmas Eve in Houston.</p>
        <p>But if Esiason is as sharp in the winds of the Meadowlands as he was in the calm of the Metrodome, the Jets will be in the Super Bowl XXIX playoffs.</p>
        <p>"Boomer was just tremendous," Coach Pete Carroll said. "He carried out the game plan, he hung in the pocket, he did a great job."</p>
        <p>He even threw to Johnny Mitchell, who departed quickly in a Viking-purple leather suit rather than discuss his best game as a Jet.</p>
        <p>"Nobody works harder in practice than Johnny does, nobody tries harder," Esiason said. "He really responded well. I told him, 'Be ready, be excited, run strong.' And he did."</p>
        <p>Mitchell had caught only 11 passes in the previous five games, but he matched that total by exploiting the gaps in the Viking defense.</p>
        <p>"He never complained outwardly, he never complained inside the locker room," Esiason said. "You never know when it's going to be your turn."</p>
        <p>Sacked only once, Esiason was throwing behind two new bodyguards who are virtual rookie offensive tackles, James Brown and Matt Willig.</p>
        <p>"I told them," the 33-year-old quarterback said, "stop reading that you're so young because I'm tired of reading that I'm so old."</p>
        <p>Of Esiason's 230 passing yards, he spread the other 110 among 6 receivers, 3 of the passes were for touchdowns to 3 wide receivers: Ryan Yarborough, Rob Moore and Art Monk. Yarborough, the Jets' second-round draft choice out of Wyoming, angled through the end zone to snatch an 11-yard arrow for his first touchdown.</p>
        <p>"You never know when Boomer's coming to you," the rookie said. "I just run my routes as hard as I can."</p>
        <p>So does Art Monk, the 36-year-old future Hall of Famer who now has caught at least one pass in 175 games, two short of Steve Largent's record. In the third quarter Monk had been shut out until he caught a short pass over the middle, but a penalty erased that reception. Not long after that he caught a 14-yard dart in the end zone for the clinching touchdown.</p>
        <p>"I was very aware that Art hadn't caught one," Esiason said. "We know that eventually he'll get his ball. And if the game's been decided, we'll just throw him a screen pass to keep the streak going."</p>
        <p>Now the Jets must keep their team winning streak going. If they beat the Dolphins, they will have won two in a row and will share first place with four games to go, their highest perch at this stage of the schedule since their 10-1 start during the 1986 season.</p>
        <p>That year the Jets were soaring, but they crashed, losing their last five games. Now, with an opportunity to share first place, this Jets team must make sure it doesn't crash.</p>
