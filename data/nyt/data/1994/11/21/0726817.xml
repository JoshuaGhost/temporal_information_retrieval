        <p>North Korea has struck its most conciliatory and cooperative note in years, announcing publicly that it had frozen its nuclear reactor program, as promised in an agreement with the United States.</p>
        <p>It also vowed to carry out its pledge to dismantle the remaining elements in its suspected nuclear weapons sites, and said over the weekend that it had permitted American experts for the first time to visit its nuclear complex at Yongbyon, just north of the capital.</p>
        <p>The visit was part of what the North called "useful and constructive" talks on safely storing and then disposing of fuel rods that the United States fears North Korea might turn into weapons-grade material.</p>
        <p>The American team visited North Korea for five days. It inspected a muddy cooling pond where North Korea is storing nearly 8,000 spent fuel rods taken from a small reactor last spring. If reprocessed, the uranium in the rods could yield enough plutonium to make four or five nuclear bombs, American intelligence officials have said.</p>
        <p>An important part of the nuclear agreement is that North Korea will not reprocess those rods and will eventually allow them to be stored outside the country.</p>
        <p>The agreement with the United States aims to dismantle three old-style graphite-core reactors that produce plutonium, the key component in a nuclear bomb.</p>
        <p>In return, North Korea is to receive two modern light-water reactors for generating electricity. The United States has promised to open normal diplomatic communications eventually.</p>
        <p>The North Korean statement conspicuously left out one important feature of the agreement. The United States has demanded that the North open two nuclear waste storage sites to inspections in the hopes that they will reveal how much plutonium the North Koreans may have diverted.</p>
        <p>North Korea has flatly said in the past that those waste sites are off-limits, although the agreement with the United States suggests that they will be opened.</p>
