        <p>Resurfacing from a 14-month sabbatical from professional tennis that turned out to be more debilitating than exhilarating, Jennifer Capriati made a spirited return tonight to the sport she abandoned in despair after it broke her spirit last year.</p>
        <p>The comeback did not, by conventional standards, end happily. The unranked 18-year-old, appearing in her first tournament since the first-round 1993 United States Open loss that provoked her exit, was defeated, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, by 13th-ranked Anke Huber of Germany.</p>

        <p>Resurfacing from a 14-month sabbatical from professional tennis that turned out to be more debilitating than exhilarating, Jennifer Capriati made a spirited return tonight to the sport she abandoned in despair after it broke her spirit last year.</p>
        <p>The comeback did not, by conventional standards, end happily. The unranked 18-year-old, appearing in her first tournament since the first-round 1993 United States Open loss that provoked her exit, was defeated, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, by 13th-ranked Anke Huber of Germany.</p>
        <p>But Capriati has never been the conventional sort.</p>
        <p>Labeled a can't-miss kid when she turned professional at 13, labeled a problem child when she began to rebel against the cage of her celebrity and a lost child during her year away from the WTA Tour, Capriati defied labels tonight.</p>
        <p>Losing didn't make her flinch. She found she missed the game too much to let this comeback become a setback.</p>
        <p>"I learned I really love this game and it doesn't matter to me if I win or lose," she said of her hiatus, which began in defiance and ended, after a stint of rehabilitation following her May arrest for marijuana possession, with her return to the practice court 10 weeks back. "I experienced a lot; I found out what makes me happy."</p>
        <p>Tonight she put up a valiant fight, suffered for not being as match tough as Huber, and got tired in the third set after sending the 19-year-old Huber muttering from the court in the second.</p>
        <p>"I got tired; I'm not used to running like that," she said. "I'm in pretty good shape, but she made me run a lot. Everything just needs to get a little bit better."</p>
        <p>Capriati, who intends to start fresh in 1995 in Australia, came onto the court with the same high-wattage grin that had all but disappeared in her last months on the tour. She wore her hair, tie-dyed in a purplish-orange haze, in pigtails beneath a black baseball cap with the Arthur Ashe anti-AIDS insignia. The fingernails on the hands that delivered her double-barreled backhand were painted blue; her clothing, an old Diadora outfit, was carefully matched.</p>
        <p>She received, both coming and going, a hearty ovation from the crowd. So far as her season of discontent is concerned, it seemed everyone, from the player herself to her peers and fans, has decided to let bygones be bygones.</p>
        <p>"What's in the past is in the past: I just want to be positive now," she said. "I just want to play my best, whatever that is."</p>
        <p>The paradox of this comeback has not been lost on Capriati. She escaped from tennis 14 months ago because playing made her unhappy and she felt a need for anonymity. But when she came here last weekend from her rented condo in California to escape from her self-imposed isolation, it was fun and fulfillment she was searching for. On a tennis court, of all places.</p>
        <p>Huber justifiably thought she had logic, if not the crowd, on her side tonight: after all, Capriati hadn't performed in 14 months.</p>
        <p>"Maybe she got a little tired, it's normal," said Huber, who isn't one of Capriati's circuit chums and was unaware that the 1992 Olympic gold medalist intended to launch her comeback here. "I think she didn't move so well as she can, but when you hear the name Capriati, you know she can play well. You know she's been No. 5." Capriati's highest ranking was actually one rung lower.</p>
        <p>Despite tonight's result and Huber's relative indifference to the momentousness of the occasion, it proved to be a homecoming for Capriati.</p>
        <p>Uncertain whether the other players would ostracize her in response to the year she spent on her own renegade circuit, Capriati's first gasp of relief came when her peers welcomed her back to the battlefield, no questions asked.</p>
        <p>The presiding WTA Tour attitude at the event Capriati had hoped would be her third of the year before injury intervened and delayed her comeback, has been forgive and forget.</p>
        <p>Capriati found a doubles partner, Mercedes Paz, without even trying. She and her unofficial coach, adviser and new neighbor, Jose Higueras, who signed on simply because he found Capriati likable, made every minute of practice count.</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't say I'm in tiptop shape," said Capriati, who continues to search out a tolerable balance between dieting and deprivation, "but I feel good enough to break the ice."</p>
        <p>And she did it on her own terms: aware that this debut of sorts would pack an emotional wallop, Capriati asked her parents to stay away. She did not, she told them, think she could cope with their tension as well as her own.</p>
        <p>Capriati still doesn't want to measure out her life in wins and losses: in her first four seasons on the tour, her self-esteem rose and fell with them. By the time she played and lost her last match, at the first round of the 1993 United States Open, she felt like she was playing because she had to. Always uncomfortable with the notion of having to be anybody's role model, she felt like everybody's robot.</p>
        <p>But time away, and ample rumination on what went wrong, has changed that.</p>
        <p>"Now there's spice in my tennis again; it's like when I pick up a racquet, my essence comes through," she said. "But I'm not even thinking about winning or losing. I'm not thinking about being No. 1."</p>
        <p>Tonight's loss was the first time in five meetings that Huber got the better of Capriati. The last time she and Huber played, in the 1993 Sydney, Australia, final, happened to be the last time Capriati won a tournament title, the sixth of her career.</p>
        <p>The returnee said she wanted to wait and use this event as a barometer before formulating further plans for 1995.  TENNIS</p>
