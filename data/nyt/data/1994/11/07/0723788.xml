        <p>The Sonic Boom festival at the Miller Theater is a kind of co-op in sound. New York's reputable new-music ensembles have never drawn particularly large audiences and now find themselves in debilitating intramural competitions for shrinking ones. Sonic Boom, six concerts that began on Friday night and will run through Nov. 19, is a joint venture in contrasting musical aspirations and a shared listenership.</p>
        <p>A restaurant analogy is not out of place, for as Friday night's tasting menu was designed to show, new music can take many turns. The Da Capo Chamber Players, Continuum, the New York New Music Ensemble, the New Music Consort and Newband form the New York Consortium for New Music, and most of its members took turns on this program advertising the kind of music they will be presenting in individual concerts this month.</p>

        <p>The Sonic Boom festival at the Miller Theater is a kind of co-op in sound. New York's reputable new-music ensembles have never drawn particularly large audiences and now find themselves in debilitating intramural competitions for shrinking ones. Sonic Boom, six concerts that began on Friday night and will run through Nov. 19, is a joint venture in contrasting musical aspirations and a shared listenership.</p>
        <p>A restaurant analogy is not out of place, for as Friday night's tasting menu was designed to show, new music can take many turns. The Da Capo Chamber Players, Continuum, the New York New Music Ensemble, the New Music Consort and Newband form the New York Consortium for New Music, and most of its members took turns on this program advertising the kind of music they will be presenting in individual concerts this month.</p>
        <p>There was an absence of sternness and rigor from beginning to end. Even Elliott Carter's "Enchanted Preludes" had a lighthearted air, offering exquisite conversation between Patricia Spencer's flute and Andre Emelianoff's cello.</p>
        <p>Flutes presided over an evening that began with Jennifer Higdon's "Steeley Pause," four of them surging together in a frantic parallelism. In David Felder's "November Sky," the instrument is commanded to go forth and multiply, the flute's basic gestures catalogued and isolated on tape and then made to grow, shrink, tighten and expand. The soloist on stage in this quasi-concerto for flute and flutes was Jayn Rosenfeld. She made her way through four members of the instrument's immediate family, from piccolo to bass, while loudspeakers on either side alternately shrieked, cooed and groaned in response.</p>
        <p>In its original solo form, Conlon Nancarrow's Sonatina for Piano may be wishful thinking. Cheryl Seltzer and Joel Sachs offered it here in Yvar Mikhashoff's more playable four-hand arrangement. The materials are mainly blues and jazz, but beneath them are Mr. Nancarrow's machine-driven obsessions with complexity and rigid energy. Dean Drummond's "Then or Never" featured the zoomoozophone, the composer's own mallet-percussion device. It subdivides the 12 chromatic tones into 31. With added flute, viola and bass, "Then or Never" has for the unaccustomed Western ear a resonating indeterminacy of intonation reminiscent of gamelan orchestras.</p>
        <p>The other piece was Francis Schwartz's vaudevillian exercise called "Cannibal-Caliban." Mugging, winks, eye- and neck-rolling, grimaces and hisses become musical devices, though often seen and not heard. The Consortium's fine player pool for the evening were: Stefani Starin, Ms. Higdon, Shelly Watson, Mark Steinberg, David Gresham, Jill Jaffe, Richard Sosinsky, Dominic Donato, Michael Lipsey and Paul Guerguerian. Mr. Sachs conducted the Schwartz, Mr. Drummond his own piece.  MUSIC REVIEW</p>
