        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Representative Dick Armey's letter ("Gag Rule Isn't Part of G.O.P. 'Contract,' " Nov. 1) is a fine example of political doublespeak.</p>
        <p>His letter does not acknowledge the fact that a welfare reform proposal, part of the House Republican "Contract With America," would create a brand-new gag rule on abortion information. His assertion that the bill would not restore the old Reagan-Bush-era gag rule on Title X Federal family planning funds is an example of being accurate and misleading at the same time.</p>
        <p>The proposed gag rule in the "Contract," which would be attached to Title IV A.F.D.C. funds, is every bit as objectionable and discriminatory as its Title X predecessor. That's the crux of the matter. As your editorial ("The Gag Rule, Revisited," Oct. 24) pointed out, any gag rule is unjust, compromises quality and draws a class distinction between women who can afford care and the vulnerable poor and young women who rely on publicly funded providers.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Armey accurately states that A.F.D.C. funds have never been used for family planning, he again misleads. What he fails to say is that the "contract" proposes redirecting some $40 billion in A.F.D.C. monies to finance state initiatives for reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies. This new, state-directed application of A.F.D.C. monies might well include family planning services; hence the attachment of a new gag rule to these funds.</p>
        <p>Last, Mr. Armey contends that a full range of family planning assistance is already financed under current law. Yet in New York State, 64 percent of sexually active, low-income women and teen-agers at risk of unintended pregnancy receive no organized family planning services. CAROL L. REICHERT Acting Exec. Dir., Family Planning Advocates of New York State Albany, Nov. 2, 1994</p>
