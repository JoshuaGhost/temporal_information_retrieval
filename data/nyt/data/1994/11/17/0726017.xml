        <p>IN Dickens's "Christmas Carol," Scrooge is as selfish as he is wealthy. Bob Cratchit, his clerk, is as loving as he is poor. When a musical version of the story begins previews next Wednesday at the Paramount, on Seventh Avenue at 32d Street in Manhattan, the gulf between the rich and the poor will be instantly evoked in the set designs by Tony Walton and the costumes by William Ivey Long.</p>
        <p>Dickens's story takes place in the 1840's. Mike Ockrent, the show's director, set the musical in the 1880's, with a flashback to the 1830's. "The 1880's was the time of England's maximum financial power," Mr. Walton said, "and polarized the comparison between the rich and the poor."</p>
        <p>Scrooge's nephew, Fred, lives in a house (at left) with gilt picture frames, voluptuously upholstered furniture and masses of candelabra. The Cratchit house (above) has drab walls, mismatched furniture and beds no better than pallets.</p>

        <p>IN Dickens's "Christmas Carol," Scrooge is as selfish as he is wealthy. Bob Cratchit, his clerk, is as loving as he is poor. When a musical version of the story begins previews next Wednesday at the Paramount, on Seventh Avenue at 32d Street in Manhattan, the gulf between the rich and the poor will be instantly evoked in the set designs by Tony Walton and the costumes by William Ivey Long.</p>
        <p>Dickens's story takes place in the 1840's. Mike Ockrent, the show's director, set the musical in the 1880's, with a flashback to the 1830's. "The 1880's was the time of England's maximum financial power," Mr. Walton said, "and polarized the comparison between the rich and the poor."</p>

        <p>To envelop the audience in Victorian London, and not leave it floating in the Paramount's cavernous space, Mr. Walton designed a set that stretches 350 feet from wing to wing. In the story, a door knocker turns into the face of Marley, Scrooge's late partner. But the audience wouldn't be able to see that, so in this show the facade of a house will become Marley's face, with windows for eyes and a lintel for a mouth. The rich women will be dressed like their houses. Skirts, like windows, will be elaborately swagged and beribboned. "I designed the clothes as architecture," Mr. Long said. The show runs through Jan. 1.  CURRENTS</p>
