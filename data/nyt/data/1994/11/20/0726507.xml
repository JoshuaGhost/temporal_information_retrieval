        <p>A BROTHER and a sister from Caldwell are trying to turn back time a bit by creating a 50's-style diner in a space that used to be a bank. While there are a few other retro diners scattered around the state, theirs, called Bobby-Q's, is in the Livingston Mall here and may be the only one in a shopping mall in the state.</p>
        <p>"That's really the first I've heard of any diner in any mall in New Jersey," said Larry Fidel, executive vice president of the New Jersey Restaurant Association in Somerset. The organization represents 1,400 restaurant owners in the state and was originally the Newark Diners Association when it was formed in 1942.</p>

        <p>A BROTHER and a sister from Caldwell are trying to turn back time a bit by creating a 50's-style diner in a space that used to be a bank. While there are a few other retro diners scattered around the state, theirs, called Bobby-Q's, is in the Livingston Mall here and may be the only one in a shopping mall in the state.</p>
        <p>"That's really the first I've heard of any diner in any mall in New Jersey," said Larry Fidel, executive vice president of the New Jersey Restaurant Association in Somerset. The organization represents 1,400 restaurant owners in the state and was originally the Newark Diners Association when it was formed in 1942.</p>
        <p>Other malls in the United States are adding diners, said Mark Schoifet, spokesman for the New York-based International Council of Shopping Centers. "Malls are looking for any kind of entertainment-oriented or food-oriented concept which will bring people into the mall," he said. "And that kind of retro diner fits into the scheme."</p>
        <p>Two national chains, Johnny Rockets and Boogies Diner, account for most of those in malls, he said. But he knew of no nonchain diners, like Bobby-Q's, in a mall.</p>
        <p>Johnny Rockets, which has "about 20" of its 62 branches in malls, opened its first mall eating place in 1989, in the Century City Shopping Center in Los Angeles, said the chain's founder, Ronn Teitelbaum.</p>
        <p>Bobby-Q's owners, Lisa and Bobby Howell, had contemplated buying a franchise, but in weighing the costs they decided to create their own business.</p>
        <p>Ms. Howell, 32, formerly a stockbroker, is the secretary and treasurer of the business. Mr. Howell, 37, a professional chef, is responsible for what he calls "the front of the house," including food, beverages, paper and chemicals. "Chemicals" refers to cleaning solutions. Mr. Howell says he is meticulous about cleanliness.</p>
        <p>The diner is named after him. As a child in Normandy Beach, where his family spent summers, he was given the nickname Bobby-Q by the owner of a surf shop when he asked too many questions about surfing. Mr. Howell became a professional surfer and traveled all over the world, using his cooking skills to earn a living on the road (or on the beach).</p>
        <p>Echoes of his surfing days can be heard in the 60's Beach Boys music he plays in the diner. That is the only non-50's music the customers will hear, Ms. Howell said.</p>
        <p>Bobby-Q's had its grand opening in June, with jitterbug dancers and a disk jockey provided by the mall, with antique cars lined up in the parking lot, and with guest appearances by several former members of the old Brooklyn Dodgers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Howell says Bobby-Q's takes him back to the time when he was young and went to Bond's on Bloomfield Avenue in Verona for a milk shake. "It was more of an innocent time," he said. He likes to see a husband and wife, or boyfriend and girlfriend, come into the diner and sit down, he said. "It gives me a great feeling."</p>
        <p>The diner's busiest times, he said, are lunch and Saturdays. Breakfast is starting to become more popular as people realize that the diner opens weekdays at 7 A.M. and Saturdays at 8:30 A.M., before the mall itself, he said. (Sundays, Bobby-Q's opens at 10 A.M.) The diner, which seats 64, is also open for dinner till 9:30 P.M. every day but Sunday, when closing time is 6 P.M.</p>
        <p>Early in the morning, before the mall opens, customers can enter the diner from the parking lot, where the chrome and red porcelain exterior sports a bright yellow awning announcing the diner in red letters.  Customers who enter it from inside the mall see a life-sized cutout of James Dean standing near the neon-lighted entrance. The diner's walls are either mirrored or are hand-hammered stainless steel in a fan design.</p>
        <p>Customers can sit at the counter's thunderbird blue spin seats (where the now defunct Howard Savings Bank's teller windows once were) or in the red booths for six. The menu features traditional diner fare: burgers, sandwiches, egg creams made with U-Bet chocolate syrup, milk shakes and homemade muffins and cakes, as well as breakfast.</p>
        <p>The menu's 50's fare is augmented by a nod to the 90's. The Howells have added a turkey burger and a veggie burger to the menu, to meet customers' demands for more health-conscious items, Mr. Howell said.</p>
        <p>Behind the counter, the vintage Coca-Cola fountain features cherry Coke and vanilla Coke, flavors of the 50's. Other items reminiscent of the past include chrome-lidded twirling glass straw holders with Coca-Cola logos and similarly marked napkin holders.</p>
        <p>Bobby-Q's is different from the chain diners. Richard Gutman, a Massachusetts architect who has written two books on diners, said Johnny Rockets is not formally a diner. He calls the chain "diner-ish," although he has included it in his 1993 book, "The American Diner Then and Now" (HarperCollins).  "In a diner, you can get breakfast at any time," he said, noting that Johnny Rockets has a limited menu and does not serve breakfast.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Boogies Diner, in a Las Vegas mall, is half diner, half clothing store, said Wendy Webster, a spokeswoman for the National Restaurant Association in Washington.</p>
        <p>Asked if he thought putting diners in malls was a trend, Mr. Gutman said, "I think you could probably call it one of many trends with diners." The original diners, he noted, were wagons in cities and went to where the people were. With the advent of cars, diners appeared on highways.</p>
        <p>"It's taken diner owners and entrepreneurs a while to realize: why shouldn't diners be in the mall?" he said.</p>
        <p>The Howells chose Kullman Industries of Avenel as the general contractors because they wanted Bobby-Q's to look authentic. Kullman Industries is the oldest diner construction company still in existence, said Mr. Gutman, the architect and author, who worked with the company on a project in Washington.</p>
        <p>Harold Kullman, the chief executive officer of the company, which his father founded in 1927, said Kullman Industries built its first mall diner in Middletown, NY., in 1984.</p>
        <p>Bobby-Q's, he said, contains exterior design elements identical to those of the former Weequahic Diner in Newark, which his company built in 1938. In fact, the vertical flutes are a Kullman design trademark, said Gary Davenport, the Kullman Industries architect who designed Bobby-Q's. Except for the red porcelain flutes (half-cylinders), which were made by an Indiana company, Mr. Kullman said, Kullman Industries fabricated all the elements of the diner in the factory, and workmen took them to the site and assembled them.</p>
        <p>As he sat in a booth with his sister and two visitors one afternoon, Mr. Howell got up to turn off the overhead lighting, to demonstrate how the diner looks at the close of the evening.</p>
        <p>"I love sitting here at the end of the night when the staff is gone," he said. "I turn all the lights off, but I leave the recessed fluorescents on, and the over-table incandescents. It gives a blue look and feeling."</p>
        <p>Ms. Howell agreed that the diner is nice at night. "But," she said, "James Dean always makes me feel like there's another customer about to come in."</p>
