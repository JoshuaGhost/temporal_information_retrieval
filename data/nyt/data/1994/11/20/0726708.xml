        <p>On a street they had strewn with rocks and stone barricades, a group of schoolchildren held an impromptu protest march today, holding a ragged Palestinian flag.</p>
        <p>"Oh martyrs, oh wounded, your blood has not been shed in vain!" they chanted, their voices lost in the rumble of passing cars.</p>
        <p>The slogans, once shouted after deadly clashes with Israeli soldiers, commemorated a different kind of martyr today: Palestinians killed by their own security forces in fierce clashes across Gaza on Friday. The chants echoed attempts by many people here to find meaning in the latest burst of bloodletting in their strife-torn city.</p>
        <p>As they visited bereaved families and paid tribute to the dead, many Palestinians acknowledged that their sense of loss was deepened by the realization that deep wounds had been self-inflicted. For many, the funerals provided a look into the abyss of civil war.</p>
        <p>With a pall of grief hanging over Gaza, many shops were closed and traffic was light. Scattered groups of demonstrators burned tires and barricaded roads as Koran verses commemorating the dead were read over mosque loudspeakers.</p>
        <p>Muslim militants set fire to the Nasser Cinema, burning movie reels and scattering them on sidewalks. But the Palestinian policemen, the object of Friday's rage, were scarcely seen, having been called back to their barracks to prevent further clashes.</p>
        <p>A few hundred supporters of the Islamic movement Hamas marched behind a black banner to the homes of the dead, vowing revenge.</p>
        <p>"Arafat, you are not one of us -- take your dogs and get out!" they shouted, waving Korans in the air. "Arafat is a collaborator! Hamas, you are the gun, and we are the bullets!"</p>
        <p>But no firearms were waved at this protest, apparently a gesture of restraint to avoid further violence. Instead, a Hamas member spray-painted angry slogans on walls.</p>
        <p>"The blood of the martyrs is a mark of shame on Arafat's forehead," one slogan said.</p>
        <p>A doctor who had treated victims of the police shootings at Shifa Hospital walked with the marchers.</p>
        <p>"Arafat is a dictator," he said bitterly. "The people don't interest him."</p>
        <p>On one street corner, men gathered around a policeman, chastising him for the actions of his comrades.</p>
        <p>"Why did you use guns?" one man asked the officer. "We are all cousins. Arabs shouldn't shoot Arabs."</p>
        <p>The policeman said little.</p>
        <p>"We had to do it," he blurted. "God will find a way."</p>
        <p>Walking down another street, two policemen expressed regret for the violence on Friday.</p>
        <p>"This was inhuman and unpatriotic," said one, who refused to be identified. "Anyone who fires on his brothers is a traitor. If I receive such orders I will not shoot."</p>
        <p>Like the policeman, relatives of the victims chose to attribute the killings to Palestinian "collaborators" and "spies" for Israel who they charged had infiltrated the police and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>"This was not simply a clash between Palestinians," said Ali Alayan, whose cousin was killed. "These were collaborators who attacked the people."</p>
        <p>Suheil Imawi, whose brother died, blamed "slaves of the Jews" for the shootings.</p>
        <p>"When the Palestinian police came to Gaza, I was among the first to greet them," he said. "I applied for a business license from the Palestinian Authority so I could pay taxes, because I felt that this government was ours. Now I won't have anything do to with it, unless it wipes out the traitors."</p>
        <p>But there were also efforts toward reconciliation as Hamas leaders met through the day with Israeli Arab mediators in an attempt to reach an understanding with the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>Dr. Saud Shawa, a Hamas supporter, said Friday's clashes were so dangerous that a way had be found for coexistence between Gaza's political factions.</p>
        <p>"It's absurd to kill one another while the enemy is watching," Dr. Shawa said. "We have no other option but dialogue between brothers. Otherwise, we Palestinians will be the losers."</p>
