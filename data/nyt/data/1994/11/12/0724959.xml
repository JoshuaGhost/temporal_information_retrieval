        <p>Moments after shooting his first hole-in-one, Emil Kijek collapsed and died on the golf course Thursday. Emergency medical workers tried unsuccessfully to revive Kijek, 79, of North Attleboro, Mass., but he was pronounced dead at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. The hospital declined to release the cause of death yesterday. A funeral home said Kijek, who played golf as many as four times a week, suffered from hypertension.</p>
        <p>Kijek teed off on the sixth hole of the Sun Valley Golf Course in Rehoboth, Mass., and his ball dropped into the cup. MORRIS DUMONT, one of Kijek's golfing partners, said: "We saw it go right to the green, drop, and roll and disappear . . . He was kind of happy, but he wasn't jumping with joy and all that." At the No. 7 tee, Dumont said, Kijek approached his ball, rolled his eyes, said, "Oh, no," then collapsed. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: GOLF</p>
