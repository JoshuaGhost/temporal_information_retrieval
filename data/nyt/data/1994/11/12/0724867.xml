        <p>Officials in this Central Valley town are not sure whether to look for Lee Lor, a 15-year-old Hmong girl with cancer who ran away from home two weeks ago with a backpack full of herbal medicines but no money.</p>
        <p>The authorities here are uncertain because the girl's parents -- and the entire community of Hmong, transplants from the mountains of Southeast Asia -- say they do not believe Lee has cancer and do not want her to have chemotherapy.</p>
        <p>So strong are their objections that when the police, acting on a court order, forcibly removed her from her home to undergo treatment on Oct. 7, they were pelted with stones and had to wrestle a knife from the father, who threatened to commit suicide if she was taken away, according to a police report.</p>
        <p>For the 35,000 Hmong refugees who have settled in Fresno, making the city home to the largest concentration of Hmong in the nation, the issue is about more than the girl's health. It is about whether she and her family have a right to choose between using herbal remedies or Western medicine.</p>
        <p>Her parents, Chong Chang and Yia Her, say the last time they saw Lee was the night of Oct. 28, when she slept on the family's sofa with several of her eight siblings. Although they filed a missing-persons report, her parents have not given the police a picture of the girl or the telephone numbers of her friends. The family shaman, a spiritual adviser the Hmong consult when they are ailing, said she had had a vision of Lee being out in the open and well.</p>
        <p>But doctors say Lee has only a 10 percent chance of survival without immediate chemotherapy. With chemotherapy, they say, she has at least an 80 percent chance of survival.</p>
        <p>The Hmong (pronounced mung), who aided American troops in the Vietnam War, were airlifted from Vietnam and Laos to Thailand after the fall of Saigon and resettled in the 1980's in cities like Fresno and St. Paul. They have been slow to embrace American culture, especially Western medicine, and Fresno has been slow to accept the Hmong.</p>
        <p>The case bears some similarities to that of Billy Best, the 16-year-old boy who is on the run from his home in Massachusetts to avoid chemotherapy and radiation therapy. But the cases diverge where culture comes into play. In Fresno, a whole community has tried to stop the authorities from treating Lee.</p>
        <p>"They were forcing her into the treatment," said Pao Fang, executive director of the Lao Family Community of Fresno Inc., a support group for Southeast Asians.</p>
        <p>Ever since the Hmong settled in the Central Valley, the authorities have grappled with enforcing laws while respecting the culture of the Hmong, who lived without electricity and running water until they came to the United States.</p>
        <p>The Fresno police have raided gardens of opium grown for medicine and responded to complaints of animals' being ritually slaughtered in apartments. Several years ago, the police began an education program to discourage men from abducting teen-age girls to marry, a common practice among the Hmong.</p>
        <p>But one of the thorniest issues has been how to treat sick children. The Hmong worship ancestors, whose misdeeds are said to resurface in illnesses for generations, said Lia Xiong, a Hmong and Laotian interpreter for Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno. In 1990, the parents of a Hmong child with club feet refused to seek treatment because they believed the child's feet were twisted to atone for the sins of ancestors. In other cases, parents fought to stop operations because they believed surgery would maim the body, leaving the patients unable to be reincarnated, Mr. Xiong said.</p>
        <p>"If a child is born blind, we don't face it," Mr. Xiong said. "If we try to change it, someone else in the family will die and get sick."</p>
        <p>The disappearance of Lee took hospital authorities and social service workers by surprise. They say they had been working closely with the Hmong community to combine Western medicine and the Hmong's own healing practices in helping sick children. At Valley Children's Hospital, shaman are allowed to burn incense outside a child's window or sacrifice a chicken or pig in the parking lot, said Cris Monahan-Bremer, the hospital spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>But Lee's case has been difficult from the beginning. In late September, she went to Valley Children's Hospital complaining of severe abdominal pains. Doctors said the girl had appendicitis. But cancer was discovered in surgery, and a tumor, an ovary and part of a Fallopian tube were removed.</p>
        <p>The Lors say they were not told about the cancer or the extensive surgery until three days later. A hospital spokeswoman said relatives were told after the operation, but there might have been a problem with the translation.</p>
        <p>In some ways, Lee is a typical American teen-ager, who likes to draw and write fan letters to Jonathan Brandis of the television show "Seaquest." But she is also Hmong and believes in shamanism and herbal remedies, her parents say.</p>
        <p>The hospital turned the matter over to Fresno County's Department of Social Services, which attained the court order to force Lee to get chemotherapy. When the police took Lee from her home in October, strapped to a gurney, the police prevented the parents from killing themselves by wresting a knife out of Mr. Lor's hands, according to Lieut. Tom Frost, a Fresno Police Department spokesman. When she arrived at the hospital, a security guard was put outside the girl's room.</p>
        <p>In protest, several hundred Hmong marched twice through the city. At a town meeting, the Hmong accused county and hospital officials of discrimination, while the officials accused the Hmong of politicizing the girl's condition, said Ernest E. Velasquez, director of the Fresno Department of Social Services.</p>
        <p>After a week of chemotherapy, Lee returned home for a few days. On the day she left, county social workers and the family attended a court hearing about whether she should be placed in a foster home until her chemotherapy was finished.</p>
        <p>Her note, written in English, read: "Dear Mom and Dad, I feel sorry it's a bad time for me, I don't want you guys to cry, it's not your fault. If I stay, there is so much trouble for me. Don't worry about me, I'll be okay. Take care of Mom and Dad everyone. I love you all. Everything is so hard on me, goodbye. Sincerely, Lee Lor."</p>
