        <p>A LAST RESORT IS NOW PART OF THE SYSTEM On many nights hundreds of people continue to take refuge in the city's after-hours homeless office in the Bronx, where straight-back plastic chairs or a plot of dirty floor are luxuries for the weary. The spectacle has become such a fixture that the city has budgeted $5 million to cover fines it owes to families dating back to 1991 and penalties it expects to pay through the end of year. And beginning next week, families left overnight in the office will be eligible for a $50 penalty payment the first night and $100 payment for each successive night. Page 1. CONSIDERING CUOMO, VOTERS SAW REVENGE Interviews with voters in five of the counties that turned against Mr. Cuomo with especial ferocity this week suggested that the main reason for their defection was their feeling that Mr. Cuomo had failed to fix their broken economy. Page 1. NEW YORK CITY  GIULIANI FIRES BACK AT REPUBLICAN CRITICS Mayor Giuliani called his fellow Republicans petty, ungracious and dangerously overconfident for the retaliation they are inflicting on him for supporting Governor Cuomo, and he warned them that if in trying to punish him, they hurt New York City, they would hurt themselves, too. Page 24. When the Mayor gave his endorsement, he knew that Cuomo campaign polls had begun to show the Governor moving ahead. Page 24. BUDGET GAP WAS NO SURPRISE, CUOMO SAYS Responding to criticism from Governor-elect Pataki about a projected $4 billion budget gap, Cuomo administration officials issued a statement suggesting that if Mr. Pataki had done his homework before promising a 25 percent cut in personal income taxes, he would have realized that there was a problem. Page 24. THE ADORNED BODY CONSIDERED Once again the Old Guy didn't get it. Hipper people than himself told him that many women were having their belly buttons perforated so that they could attach rings. He went to see for himself. About New York, Page 25. OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF LYING TO GET A DEAL After an official of the Department of Finance applied for a $1 million city contract without mentioning that he was employed by the city, he perhaps should have reconsidered announcing his job title on television. Page 25. REGION  POTATO FUNGUS IS KILLING CROP Nearly 150 years after the Irish famine of the 1840's, new virulent strains of the fungus that devastated the potato crop in Ireland are spreading across New York and many other states, plant pathologists say. Page 26. YOUTH FIGHTS REQUIREMENT TO VOLUNTEER Daniel Immediato is an unlikely litigant in a battle over the Constitution. Just 17, Mr. Immediato went to Federal District Court to fight his high school's requirement that students perform 40 hours of community service, on their own time, before they graduate. Page 26. VILLAGE TO VOTE ON OUSTER OF POLICE People in Greenport, a square-mile village near the end of Long Island's North Fork, are gearing up for a vote on whether to abolish their nine-member police force, which a grand jury report described as ill-trained, inactive and inept.
