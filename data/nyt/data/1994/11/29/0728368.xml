        <p>THAT new CD-ROM drive is aching for disks to spin. It came with an encyclopedia, a golf game and an electronic cookbook, all of which seemed like good ideas at the time. But the computer is in the spare bedroom, not the kitchen; nobody in the house plays golf, and you do not look up things in an encyclopedia that often.</p>
        <p>At around $30 to $100 a disk, few of us can afford to go wild buying software. And while books are expensive too, at least you can sample them before whipping out a credit card.</p>

        <p>THAT new CD-ROM drive is aching for disks to spin. It came with an encyclopedia, a golf game and an electronic cookbook, all of which seemed like good ideas at the time. But the computer is in the spare bedroom, not the kitchen; nobody in the house plays golf, and you do not look up things in an encyclopedia that often.</p>
        <p>At around $30 to $100 a disk, few of us can afford to go wild buying software. And while books are expensive too, at least you can sample them before whipping out a credit card.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, Sirius Publishing of Scottsdale, Ariz., has put together its second "5-ft. 10-Pak," as they call it. It holds 10 CD-ROM's in a variety of categories from a variety of publishers, and can be found in the stores for about $30.</p>
        <p>In Volume 2 are Microsoft's Multimedia Jumpstart, a potpourri; Interplay's Battle Chess, with animated pieces; Dr. Schueler's Home Medical Advisor, from Pixel Perfect; Sierra's Space Quest, an action game; Paramount Interactive's Movie Select, which interviews you to help you pick out a video to rent or buy, and Rock Rap 'n Roll, a music program to which you can add your own sounds; Two Thousand Fonts; Icom's Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective, with three cases to solve; Warbirds, from Arts and Letters, a drawing program with 400 military clip art images, and from Sirius itself, PC Karaoke Family Fun, for singing along with old favorites like "Camptown Races" and "Home on the Range." If all the disks were fully packed, that would be around 6,000 megabytes.</p>
        <p>All the programs require a computer that meets the minimal MPC (Multimedia PC) standards with a CD-ROM drive; most require Microsoft Windows; beyond that, requirements vary. Obviously, you cannot sing along with "Amazing Grace" without a sound card and microphone.</p>
        <p>These programs have been around for a while, but that makes very little difference. It is rather like waiting for a popular novel to come out in paperback. After all, fonts like Warped and Wacky, to name just two of the 2,000 Truetype and Type 1 fonts on that disk, look just as good or bad this year as they did last.  A Palette of Palettes</p>
        <p>An uncountable number of people without special training are now designing presentations because computers make it easy, or at least possible. Harvard Graphics, Coreldraw and Macdraw Pro can be mastered by anyone with a real desire to do so, the kind of desire that an order from the boss fosters.</p>
        <p>Mechanically, such programs are not that hard. But artistically? Suppose you want or need to go beyond the default palette, the combination of colors that are guaranteed to go together well, to make a presentation distinctive. Some people have the knack or the schooling to design a good-looking palette from scratch. Most of us do not.</p>
        <p>Colorup, from Pantone of Carlstadt, N.J., contains about 1,500 palettes created by professional designers for use with Windows and Macintosh business presentation programs including Harvard Graphics, Lotus Freelance, Microsoft Powerpoint, Aldus Persuasion and Micrografx Charisma and with drawing programs including Adobe Illustrator, Aldus Freehand and Coreldraw.</p>
        <p>Colorup adjusts its palette for the medium a presentation will use. The colors on the screen will be darker and denser for an image that will end up as a transparency, for instance, because the slide projector will brighten them. The colors for charts intended to be printed are not as dark, because dark colors tend to get muddied in printing.</p>
        <p>Each palette has up to 16 different colors for backgrounds, text, text shadows, outlines, highlighted words or graphics, data sets (bars in a bar chart or slices in a pie chart) and bullets. If none of the 1,500 palettes are satisfactory, they can be edited.</p>
        <p>In addition, the program contains Colorup Explorer, a six-chapter "book" on the principles of color. After you have read it, you can design your own palettes with more confidence.</p>
        <p>Colorup works on a Windows computer with 8 megabytes of free hard-disk space or on a Macintosh with 10 megabytes of space. It does not have to occupy all that space forever, of course. After you have imported a selection of palettes into the program or programs you use, you can remove it until the next time you need a new look.</p>
        <p>Colorup for Windows and Colorup for the Macintosh have a suggested retail price of $99.95 each. More information is available from Pantone at (800) 222-1149.  PERIPHERALS</p>
