        <p>The divisions between the United States and Western Europe over Bosnia erupted into unusually blunt public feuding today as leaders of Britain and France lashed out at American pressure to lift the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and step up air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces.</p>
        <p>With frustration clearly mounting among NATO members after the assault by Bosnian Serbs on the Muslim enclave of Bihac, the British Defense Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, struck back at comments by Senator Bob Dole that implied that Britain was primarily responsible for a lack of a strong military response by NATO.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rifkind said American politicians who singled out Britain as blocking decisive action by the North Atlantic alliance in Bosnia were "behaving disgracefully," given that Britain has 3,500 troops serving in the United Nations peacekeeping force there while the United States has not sent any.</p>
        <p>In Paris, a joint statement by President Francois Mitterrand and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said any moves to lift the arms embargo -- a step that has gained increasing support in the United States but that is bitterly opposed by the European Union -- would only intensify the conflict.</p>
        <p>The United States said two weeks ago that it would stop actively enforcing the arms embargo, and the Clinton Administration is under pressure from Congress to lift the ban and supply weapons to the Muslim-led Government of Bosnia. The French statement seemed to blame Washington for encouraging the Muslims to begin an offensive, provoking counterattacks by the Bosnian Serbs and the siege of Bihac.</p>
        <p>"The tragic events in Bihac show that any encouragement given to the reconquest of territory by force -- and notably the prospect of lifting the arms embargo -- is vain or dangerous," the French said. "It only fuels the cycle of violence to the detriment of the search for a negotiated peace settlement, which is the only durable solution to the conflict among the Bosnian communities."</p>
        <p>Meeting in Brussels, European Union foreign ministers argued against American calls for tougher military action and defended their diplomatic efforts. Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain said Europe had "no reason to be ashamed" of its diplomatic efforts, especially when the United States would not take part in the only kind of military option that would have a chance of imposing peace, an extensive allied ground operation.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Dole, the Republican from Kansas who will probably become the Senate majority leader when the new Congress convenes next year, is scheduled to meet NATO officials in Brussels and then to travel to London to meet Prime Minister John Major, Mr. Hurd and Mr. Rifkind on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole said on Sunday that there had been a "complete breakdown" of NATO caused by the vetoing of air strikes by "the British and the French, I must say, primarily the British." Responding to that, Mr. Rifkind told a radio interviewer:</p>
        <p>"I think that when we have thousands of brave British soldiers -- some of whom have lost their lives in Bosnia -- giving of their all to help the cause of peace, it ill becomes people in the countries that have not provided a single soldier on the ground to make that kind of criticism."</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Dole issued a statement saying: "One of the keys to a healthy alliance has been close U.S. and British ties. I hope we can narrow our differences over Bosnia, and reaffirm our commitment to a credible NATO."</p>
        <p>Mr. Major underscored Britain's position today in a meeting with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, who called for military action to help the Bosnian Muslims.</p>
        <p>British officials said Mr. Major had argued that increased use of air strikes would be of little use militarily and would not help protect civilians. They said Mr. Major had told the Pakistani leader that lifting the arms embargo would only worsen the conflict, and that the only way to reach peace was through a negotiated settlement.</p>

        <p>U.N. Chief to Visit Sarajevo</p>
        <p>UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 28 (Special to The New York Times) -- Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali will fly to Sarajevo on Wednesday to try to meet with the leaders of the Bosnian Government and the rebel Bosnian Serbs in an effort to talk them into stopping their war, United Nations officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>The officials said Mr. Boutros-Ghali would seek to meet either separately or together with President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia and Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs.</p>
        <p>The Secretary General sent letters early this afternoon to the two leaders proposing the meeting, but had not yet received a reply, said Joe Sills, Mr. Boutros-Ghali's spokesman.</p>
        <p>The Secretary General's peace initiative came after the head of United Nations peacekeeping operations asserted that the United Nations was "being made a scapegoat" for not acting more forcefully in Bosnia. The official, Kofi Annan, insisted that ordering further military action was up to the member states but that he believed that they lacked a collective will to do so.</p>
        <p>"I believe the U.N. is being made a scapegoat -- of course we do have a scapegoat function," Mr. Annan said. "But it is absolutely unfair when member states do not want to take the risks -- when they do not want to commit the resources -- but blame the U.N. for failure to act."</p>
