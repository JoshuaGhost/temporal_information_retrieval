        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"South Korea to Lift Curbs on Business Ties to North" (front page, Nov. 8) states that although South Korean companies have expressed fears that Japanese competitors might beat them in setting up factories in North Korea, the Japanese "are expected to go slow, partly because of a history of poor relations between Japan and Korea resulting from World War II."</p>
        <p>Poor relations between Japan and Korea go back much further than that. Japanese military aggression colors much of Korea's history.</p>
        <p>Seventeen centuries ago, the Japanese began taking part in the struggles between the independent kingdoms of the Korean Peninsula. By 369, Japanese forces were battling for control of southern Korea and established a small military colony near the present city of Pusan. In 391, the Japanese marched north and penetrated as far as Pyongyang.</p>
        <p>During Japan's Ashikaga shogunate (1338-1573), Japanese pirates regularly wreaked havoc along Korea's coast, raiding ports and sacking towns. In 1359, Japan attacked and briefly occupied Pyongyang. In 1592 and 1597, the Japanese feudal lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi attemptedinvasions of Korea in unsuccessful attempts to conquer the peninsula.</p>
        <p>Korea fell prey to Japanese imperialism in the late 19th century. In 1895, Japan engineered the assassination of Korea's Queen Min, the anti-Japanese royal consort. Korea became a Japanese protectorate in 1905 and was annexed to the Japanese Empire in 1910. It was under Japanese domination until 1945.</p>
        <p>Today, many South Koreans view Japan as a greater threat to their country than the regime in Pyongyang. BRADFORD TREBACH  Bronx, Nov. 9, 1994 The writer is a lawyer specializing in international affairs.</p>
