        <p>Take Six tried so hard to make something special happen at the Beacon Theater on Saturday night that it was hard not to feel some sympathy when nothing came of its work. The band, a pop-gospel group with supercharged harmonies that borrow from jazz vocal music to doo-wop to quartet gospel music, did its best to create the sort of mood that gets a house rocking, but it failed.</p>
        <p>The group tried sing-alongs. Its leader, Mark Kibble, tried to preach. With choreography, astoundingly tight vocal arrangements and costumes that looked like something out of a J. Crew catalogue, the singers tried to present a communal image, a band hard at work pleasing its constituency.</p>

        <p>Take Six tried so hard to make something special happen at the Beacon Theater on Saturday night that it was hard not to feel some sympathy when nothing came of its work. The band, a pop-gospel group with supercharged harmonies that borrow from jazz vocal music to doo-wop to quartet gospel music, did its best to create the sort of mood that gets a house rocking, but it failed.</p>
        <p>The group tried sing-alongs. Its leader, Mark Kibble, tried to preach. With choreography, astoundingly tight vocal arrangements and costumes that looked like something out of a J. Crew catalogue, the singers tried to present a communal image, a band hard at work pleasing its constituency.</p>
        <p>When Take Six first appeared, in 1988, it was a spectacularly talented a cappella group that instead relied on its music alone. In concert, the group moved between hard-driving, older gospel music and modern pop music, draping pieces with tight, close harmony singing or adding jazz harmonic movements and unexpected dissonances. It was distinct, and convincing.</p>
        <p>Their recent album, "Join the Band" (Reprise), pairs the group's six singers with a band and undistinguished material, and at the Beacon the songs that worked best were the a cappella pieces. The harmonies, with all their sophistication, set off the individual lead singers and let them emote with long melismas and bent notes and growls. And the group's smooth blend stood out, with the harmonics at the upper end of its chords glistening. But when the band started playing, the details vanished, leaving the singers sounding ordinary.</p>
        <p>When the band toured without instruments, it managed to work up sets with headlong momentum. It now tries to do too much, with individual members soloing or telling stories and the instrumentalists coming onstage only for a tune or two. Nothing seemed to lead logically to the next step, which made the show fragmented, as if the band were unsure of its role, which was to bring the transcendence that religious music can give. At times it came close, and though it was clear that in another place at another time, it could shake a house down, at the Beacon the band never quite made it.  POP REVIEW</p>
