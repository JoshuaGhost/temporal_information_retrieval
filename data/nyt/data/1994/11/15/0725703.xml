        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Stereotype of Jews Is Revived" (Arts pages, Nov. 7):</p>
        <p>Your inclusion of my name as the source of an undescribed "derogatory anecdote" for William Cash's inflammatory essay in The Spectator has occasioned a torrent of phone calls curious as to what the anecdote was and why I would participate at all in what is widely regarded here as an exercise in anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>Because relatively few people in Hollywood have seen the Spectator article, but have relied on your description for information about it, I regret that you mention me without more adequately relaying my account of how Mr. Cash quoted me entirely out of context.</p>
        <p>I had cited the incident, of a Boston Brahmin would-be producer trying to dress in a more flamboyant, "show business" mode, as the only occasion in my decade in Hollywood when someone I knew suspected he was being excluded by some sort of ethnic cabal. In seeking excuses, the Brahmin, who had failed at other careers before failing as a producer, projected his bigotry onto others.</p>
        <p>The point of the anecdote was to rebut Mr. Cash's perhaps paranoid thesis, and not in any way to support it. WILLIAM H. STADIEM  Santa Monica, Calif., Nov. 8, 1994</p>
