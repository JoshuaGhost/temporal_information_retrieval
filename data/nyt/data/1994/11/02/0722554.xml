        <p>BOBBY VALENTINE became the first former major league manager to be hired to manage in Japan with the announcement yesterday that he signed with the Chiba Lotte Marines.</p>
        <p>Valentine, who was dismissed by the Texas Rangers during the 1992 season after more than six years in the job, reportedly signed with the Marines for $1 million over three years.</p>
        <p>Valentine's contract is also said to have incentive clauses that would pay him $600,000 to $1.7 million a year depending on how high the Marines finish. Chiba finished fifth in Japan's six-team Pacific League this year.</p>
        <p>Valentine managed the Mets' Class AAA Norfolk team in the International League this year. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL</p>
