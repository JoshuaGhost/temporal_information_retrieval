        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Homeless Sleeping in City Office: Last Resort Is Now Part of System" (front page, Nov. 12) is a perfect example of why the public has become increasingly cynical about homelessness. After more than a decade, family homelessness remains the most misunderstood issue in New York City. And the most recent court-ordered response -- paying $100 a day to families for whom housing is not immediately available -- is ludicrous.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Homeless Sleeping in City Office: Last Resort Is Now Part of System" (front page, Nov. 12) is a perfect example of why the public has become increasingly cynical about homelessness. After more than a decade, family homelessness remains the most misunderstood issue in New York City. And the most recent court-ordered response -- paying $100 a day to families for whom housing is not immediately available -- is ludicrous.</p>
        <p>Homelessness is not simply a housing issue. The typical homeless family consists of a young mother with two children. She has little education and neither job nor independent living skills. She probably suffers from substance abuse and is the victim of domestic violence. Before these families can and should be permanently housed, we must deal with the problems that are keeping them homeless and dependent.</p>
        <p>This year the city has been forced to budget $5 million for direct payment in fines to these families. Both the homeless and the taxpayer would be better served if these funds were spent on education and job-readiness programs in more transitional housing facilities.</p>
        <p>In short, advocates and the courts need to allow the city to respond to this crisis through the implementation of effective public policy. When we stop creating public chaos, we can start solving the problems of homelessness. RALPH NUNEZ  President &amp; Chief Executive Officer Homes for the Homeless New York, Nov. 14, 1994</p>
