        <p>IF there is one thing that 1990's investors have had pounded into their heads, it is that stocks are the best long-term investment. Over the long stretch of history, we are told, stocks produce an average return of about 10 percent a year. The academic studies prove nothing else does as well.</p>
        <p>That belief in this is growing can be seen in the mutual fund industry's boom. The stock market may have done nothing this year, but three of the four best months ever for stock mutual funds -- in terms of net cash flow from investors -- were in 1994. Investors have put more money into stock funds than they took out for 48 consecutive months. To put that in perspective, the industry's old record was 12 months, a string that ended with the 1987 crash.</p>

        <p>That belief in this is growing can be seen in the mutual fund industry's boom. The stock market may have done nothing this year, but three of the four best months ever for stock mutual funds -- in terms of net cash flow from investors -- were in 1994. Investors have put more money into stock funds than they took out for 48 consecutive months. To put that in perspective, the industry's old record was 12 months, a string that ended with the 1987 crash.</p>
        <p>We have a theory about the relation of academic research to the stock market. First the academics discover something, and are ignored by most money managers and the public. Those who believe make money. Then, as the word spreads, more and more climb on the bandwagon and the trend gets even truer, as they drive prices to ridiculous heights. Then the bandwagon crashes.</p>
        <p>That happened, to cite one example, when the professors found that small stocks had a way of doing better than big stocks, year after year. Eventually, so many people were throwing money at small stocks that prices got out of hand in 1983, and such stocks did poorly for the rest of the decade.</p>
        <p>A couple of important stock market anniversaries serve to remind us that while stocks may be winners in the long run, the short term can be a very long time indeed. It was 40 years ago last week, on Nov. 23, 1954, that the Dow Jones industrial average first closed above its 1929 peak. Anyone who bought at that peak had a 25-year wait to break even.</p>
        <p>And next week brings the 20th anniversary of the end of the worst post-Depression bear market. On Dec. 6, 1974, the Dow closed at 577.60, a 12-year low. It was down 45 percent in less than two years.</p>
        <p>The papers then were not full of talk about how stocks were a wonderful long-term investment. Instead, they discussed how much lower the Dow would go -- another 10 percent or so was the consensus forecast -- and how long the recession would last. In fact, it would be over in a few months, but most expected it to last longer. The triumphant Democrats -- having scored big gains in mid-term elections -- were talking of imposing controls on prices, wages, executive compensation and profits.</p>
        <p>Today, things could not be more different. Over 20 years, stocks have risen at an average annual rate of 15 percent. And now the triumphant Republicans are talking of cutting government regulation and the capital gains tax.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, in 1974 people weren't that eager to own stocks. Households had 12 percent of their assets in stocks and mutual funds, compared to 22 percent now. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was trading at 7 times earnings and yielding 5.4 percent in dividends. The figures now are 18 and 2.9 percent.</p>
        <p>The bet here is that this all has a ways to go, that Americans will have more money in stocks than they do now before the bottom falls out. The sagging stock market early last week reflected unwarranted recession fears, which are likely to fade.</p>
        <p>Still, it seems like a sure bet that the next 20 years won't be as good as the last 20 for the stock market.  MARKET WATCH</p>
