        <p>OEDIPUS AT STALINGRAD  By Gregor von Rezzori. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $25.</p>
        <p>Originally published in 1954, during the first shining years of Germany's postwar reconstruction miracle, Gregor von Rezzori's novel (available now for the first time in English) is a trenchant psychological portrait of Berlin on the eve of World War II. It is the summer of 1938, and while "decisive and great events" are occurring, the city itself, awash in bourgeois self-intoxication, has begun "to rise like a magic carpet above reality." One of the inhabitants of this glib world is Traugott von Jassilkowski, the son of a Prussian estate manager; Traugott has left his studies at Konigsberg to pursue life with the fashionable cafe and bar set. In that fateful summer, he marries a munitions heiress, a "blond thoroughbred" with a "deluxe body" -- and so, he thinks, finds his entree into a more rarefied life, one that will free him from human baseness. A kind of Freudian Everyman, Traugott provides the author with numerous opportunities to satirize Germany's "philistine soul." Mr. von Rezzori (who is best known for his novel "Memoirs of an Anti-Semite" and the memoir "The Snows of Yesteryear") exposes the dreamy parvenu's vulgarity and moral lethargy. Although in this seamless translation by H. F. Broch de Rothermann and the author, the unremittingly sardonic narrative voice of "Oedipus at Stalingrad" occasionally wearies, the overall effect of this voluptuously mordant Bildungsroman is to convince us of the integrity of Mr. von Rezzori's passion for uncovering sham and self-deceit wherever, and whenever, they are found.
