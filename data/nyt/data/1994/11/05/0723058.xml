        <p>Once again Wall Street took fright at news that Main Street was doing well. The Government's report yesterday that the unemployment rate had fallen to a four-year low rekindled fears that a too-strong economy would produce an inflation rate that would hurt stocks and bonds.</p>

        <p>Once again Wall Street took fright at news that Main Street was doing well. The Government's report yesterday that the unemployment rate had fallen to a four-year low rekindled fears that a too-strong economy would produce an inflation rate that would hurt stocks and bonds.</p>
        <p>Stocks dropped even though the dollar stabilized and the earnings season was coming to a close with a surprising number of companies reporting results that beat Wall Street's expectations.</p>
        <p>Heavy use of computerized selling programs in the last 30 minutes of trading took the Dow sharply lower into the close. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.36 points yesterday, to 3,807.52, while the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 5.63 points, to 462.28. The smaller-company Nasdaq composite index dropped 6.02 points, to 766.08.</p>
        <p>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was above normal, with 282.3 million shares changing hands, about 2 percent more than this year's average of 279 million shares.</p>
        <p>The proximate cause of yesterday's slide was the Labor Department's report that the unemployment rate had dipped to 5.8 percent. Even the news that the economy added only 194,000 new jobs, fewer than the 239,000 jobs that private economists had expected, failed to ease the bond market's slide, which promptly led to the fall in stocks.</p>
        <p>"The numbers themselves were no surprise and built into prices anyway," said David Holt, market strategist for Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "The big downdraft came from the arbitragers, who were liquidating their positions as they go into the weekend."</p>
        <p>The absence of countervailing good news -- in other words, signs that elsewhere the economy was stumbling -- led the traders to veer toward pessimism over future moves by the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>Every economic report that can be interpreted as a sign of a slowing economy makes the market less certain that the Fed will raise interest rates a sixth time this year on Nov. 15. For now, however, the markets appear to be assuming the Fed will raise rates, bidding down stocks and bonds.</p>
        <p>Stock traders are in a bind. Earnings are better than ever: 441 of the S.&amp; P. 500 companies have reported earnings so far and of these, 54.6 percent beat expectations. But the strong economy that produced those earnings is alarming the bond market with inflation fears.</p>
        <p>A variety of high-technology stocks fell. Shares of Chiron, a biotechnology company, fell 3 1/8, to 59, after it reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Thursday. Megatest established a 52-week low of 8 3/4 before closing at 9 7/8, down 3 5/8. Megatest, a maker of integrated circuit-testing equipment, said it could report a loss for the first quarter ending Nov. 26.</p>
        <p>The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 2.45 points, to 254.21, with declining stocks outnumbering advancing stocks by 1,486 to 662. The American Stock Exchange market value index fell 1.66 points, to 452.91.</p>
        <p>Of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow industrials, 22 fell, led by I.B.M., which dropped 2 1/8, to 71 1/8. Of the 500 stocks that make up the S.&amp; P. 500, 390 fell, led by Exxon, which dropped 1 1/8, to 61 1/2.</p>
        <p>In Tokyo, stocks ended higher yesterday. The Nikkei index of 225 issues closed up 60.91 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, at 19,811.56. For the week, the Nikkei was up 6.4 points.</p>
