        <p>Hobbling on a cane, his torso encased in a clear plastic brace, Firefighter Greg Smith said he had been told the two children were all right, but he wanted to see them with his own eyes.</p>
        <p>Then, in a play area of Bellevue Hospital Center, he spotted Edwin Espinosa, the 4-year old boy whom he had tucked under his arm the week before and tried to protect as an aerial ladder collapsed and they tumbled six stories.</p>
        <p>"There's my buddy Edwin," he said.</p>
        <p>Edwin gave him a high five. Then they hugged.</p>
        <p>Firefighter Smith also visited Edwin's sister, Lisette, 5, who suffered two broken legs in the fall more than a week ago, as Mr. Smith tried to rescue the children and their parents from a burning building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The Fire Department is still trying to determine why the rear-mount aerial ladder buckled and careened to the ground as firefighters battled the blaze on Nov. 20. Yreno Espinosa, the children's father, fell to his death in the incident. His wife, Agueda Santana, is in serious but stable condition.</p>
        <p>"We haven't reached any conclusions as yet," said Marilyn Mode, Deputy Fire Commissioner for public information. She said that representatives of the manufacturer, Seagrave Fire Apparatus of Clintonville, Wis. and state safety officials were also helping in the investigation.</p>
        <p>Mildred Lopez, the children's grandmother, said Lisette knows her father is dead. She said it really hasn't sunk in with Edwin, but he seems to be afraid of more things now than he used to be. He was released from the hospital yesterday.</p>
        <p>Firefighter Smith, who sustained a fractured arm and several broken vertebrae, was scheduled for release today. He said he was trying not to dwell on the details of the accident, but he described the awful feeling as the ladder buckled.</p>
        <p>"You ever slip on ice, and fall?" he said. "How quick that goes? Just as quick." He shuddered. "It's scary."</p>
        <p>A N.Y.F.D. baseball cap on his head, Firefighter Smith sat with his children -- 16-month old daughter Victoria and son Gregory-- nearby. He acknowledged that as he had tucked Edwin under his left arm and tried to wedge Lisette against the rail of the ladder as it fell, he had thought of his own kids.</p>
        <p>"I just wanted to know they were doing all right," he said of his visit yesterday. "I just really wanted to know they were alive."</p>
