        <p>Cellular telephone fraud in New York City has become so rampant that a cellular service in Washington will temporarily block its customers from using their wireless phones when they travel in New York.</p>
        <p>Cellular One of Washington-Baltimore, owned by SBC Communications Inc., has sent its customers letters notifying them that it would block the service beginning on Thursday because it had compiled a huge backlog of phone numbers used in New York that appeared to be fraudulent.</p>
        <p>Company officials said they would resume service once they finished investigating each case, which they said would take three weeks.</p>
        <p>Cellular telephone fraud occurs when people use false identification numbers on their wireless telephones and make calls. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association said fraud costs had soared to about $1 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Cellular thieves typically use radio scanners to capture the identification numbers of legitimate cellular phones, which transmit the numbers each time they are used. These numbers are then written onto a computer chip inside an inactive phone, effectively "cloning" the original.</p>
