        <p>As a closet elitist and part-time Roger Kimball watcher, I was curious to see what Mr. Kimball would make of "In Defense of Elitism." I can't say I'm surprised to find that his review wholeheartedly endorses William A. Henry 3d's condemnation of egalitarianism.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a closet elitist and part-time Roger Kimball watcher, I was curious to see what Mr. Kimball would make of "In Defense of Elitism." I can't say I'm surprised to find that his review wholeheartedly endorses William A. Henry 3d's condemnation of egalitarianism.</p>
        <p>It's regrettable that Henry believed that women have made no contribution to Western civilization and that African cultures can be summed up in the image of black folks with bones in their noses. It's also regrettable that he wanted to unburden himself of such fatuous opinions and still be considered a "liberal." But I think liberalism would do well to hold to higher intellectual standards than Henry's. There's an important principle at stake here.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, Roger Kimball's and William Henry's ridicule of egalitarian "nonsense" like "the forced 'integration' of the retarded into classrooms for normal children." As the father of one "retarded" and one "normal" child, I have had to do a lot of research on this subject, and have found that "full inclusion" (as it is called) not only helps the "retarded" to model themselves on their nondisabled peers, but helps "normal" children to learn important social skills in dealing with the developmentally disabled. Teachers in inclusive programs have been known to report that their "disabled" children have fewer behavioral and social deficits than many of their "normal" charges. Are retarded children somehow damaging their classmates' chances of becoming rocket scientists? Only a rank ignoramus would say so.</p>
        <p>But here's where my closet elitism is peeking out. Unfashionable as it may be to admit, I actually believe that drama critics like William Henry -- and magazine editors like Roger Kimball -- should not try to pass themselves off as commentators on subjects about which they clearly know next to nothing. If my retarded son can do some of his homework, then surely these sorry champions of "elitism" can do some of theirs.  MICHAEL BERUBE  Urbana, Ill.</p>
