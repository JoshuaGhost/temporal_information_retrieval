        <p>The world's first marathoner didn't get to enjoy the fruits of victory for very long. Legend has it that in 490 B.C., Pheidippides ran 25 miles from a battlefield at Marathon to tell the Greeks in Athens that they had defeated the Persians. Once the message was delivered, the tuckered-out runner promptly dropped dead.</p>
        <p>Training methods and medical care have improved in the past two and a half millennia, so the vast majority of the runners lined up in Staten Island this morning at the start of the New York City Marathon should be able to proclaim their own victories: I won; I improved my time; I made it.</p>
        <p>Their trek through the five boroughs of New York will mark the 25th time the city's marathon has been run. Although it isn't the oldest marathon and it isn't the most grueling, it can boast that it provides the world's longest urinal for the world's largest starting group of runners.</p>
        <p>Boasting rights for other marathons as well as some odder incidents in the history of the sport, are noted at right. ANNE CRONIN WORLD'S OLDEST MARATHON -- The modern Olympic games, which began in 1896, included a 40-kilometer (24.85-mile) marathon. It was won by Spiridon Loues of Greece, with a 2:58:50 time. OLDEST IN U.S. -- The Boston Marathon, first run 1897, is the world's oldest annual marathon. Members of the Boston Athletic Association had attended the 1896 Olympic games and decided to start a marathon in Boston. The race, then 24.7 miles, was won by John J. McDermott in 2:55:10, although he walked several times during the final miles. GLUTTON FOR PUNISHMENT -- John A. Kelley ran the Boston Marathon 61 straight years, from 1931 to 1992. He won twice, in 1935 and 1945, and came in second seven times. In one of his runner-up runs, Mr. Kelley tapped Ellison "Tarzan" Brown, then leading, as he passed him. This riled Mr. Brown, who redoubled his efforts and went on to win. The spot of the tap was called "Heartbreak Hill" in The Boston Globe the next day. The name stuck. HOW THE MARATHON GOT ITS LENGTH -- Marathons were generally 40 kilometers long until the 1908 Olympics in London. Princess Mary, who was the official starter for the race, asked whether the starting line could be moved to Windsor Castle, so her children could watch from the nursey windows. This extended the course to 26 miles, 385 yards to the finish line. The longer "London" distance was adopted as the standard in 1924. PLEASE DON'T USE THE BUSHES -- The world's largest urinal will be installed at the start of the New York City Marathon in Staten Island. The 290-foot facility will be located at the Fort Wadsworth Naval Station along with 350 portable toilets. Another 200 portable toilets will be placed along the route. A CAST OF THOUSANDS -- This year, more than 27,000 runners will be competing in the New York City Marathon, which could break its own record for most starters -- 28,656 in 1992. The London Marathon is the second largest, with 25,194 this year. SHOELESS ABEBE -- The 1960 Rome Olympic marathon was won by an Ethiopian who had never run a marathon outside Addis Ababa. Abebe Bikila ran barefoot and won with a record time of 2:15:16.2. He was also the first man to ever win consecutive Olympic marathons, finishing the race in Toyko with another record time of 2:12:11.2, despite having had an appendectomy a month before. He wore shoes the second time around. GOLD STANDARD -- The record for Olympic marathon wins is two, shared by Mr. Bikila (1960, 1964) and Waldemar Cierpinski of East Germany (1976, 1980). Grete Waltz of Norway won in New York nine times (1978-80, 1982-86, 1988). WOMEN'S FIRSTS -- The first woman officially entered in a marathon was Violet Percy of Great Britain, who ran the 1926 London Marathon in 3:40:22. The first championship marathon for women was held by the Road Runners Club of America in 1970. Women's Olympic marathons began in 1984. LONG HAULS -- The longest marathon races ever were the 1920's transcontinental runs from Los Angeles to New York City. Andy Payne ran 3,422 miles in 1928 with a time of 573:04:34. Johnny Salo won the 1929 version of 3,665 miles in 525:57:2, for an average of 6.97 miles per hour. The longest annual race is Australia's Westfield Run. The record for the 658 miles was set by Yiannis Kouros of Greece in 1989; 5 days, 2 hours, 27 minutes, 27 seconds. The longest individual run on record was Sara Covington-Fulcher's lap around the United States, starting and finishing in Los Angeles. The 11,134 miles took from July 21, 1987, to Oct. 2, 1988, to cover.
