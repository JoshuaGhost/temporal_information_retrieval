        <p>WELCOME to my zoo," said Matthew (Pop) Shortell, ushering a guest into a room packed with more than a half a century's worth of memories. Hundreds of pictures and dozens of awards were filed away in boxes, plastered to the walls and stacked mountain-high on wooden book shelves.</p>

        <p>WELCOME to my zoo," said Matthew (Pop) Shortell, ushering a guest into a room packed with more than a half a century's worth of memories. Hundreds of pictures and dozens of awards were filed away in boxes, plastered to the walls and stacked mountain-high on wooden book shelves.</p>
        <p>Behind the oversized, elevated chair on which Mr. Shortell has spent countless hours seated -- typing game reports and compiling endless statistics of every sport played in community of Ansonia for the past 57 years -- hang autographed pictures of former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.</p>
        <p>On the wall to the left of the work station, amidst a collage of photographs and mementos of athletes from the local area, is a signed picture of Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth. Present-day players are represented by autographed pictures of the Mets' rookie first baseman Rico Brogna and a signed portrait of future football Hall of Famer, Jerry Rice.</p>
        <p>But the most cherished photographs in his shrine are of all the players who ever starred at Ansonia High School.</p>
        <p>"Every kid who puts on that uniform is my idol," said Mr. Shortell, a retired hospital orderly, who is now a regular columnist for the New Haven Register and a contributor to five other Connecticut-based newspapers. "If he or she is good enough to put that suit on, and good enough to represent us, they are good enough to be my heroes."</p>
        <p>From the age of 15, Matthew Shortell has been Ansonia's statistician. Now the town historian as well, Mr. Shortell claims to have watched or officiated at more than 30,000 sporting events in the Ansonia area.</p>
        <p>The statistician, who recently turned 72, reels off the staggering numbers as if they were printed on his own Social Security card: 15,381 basketball games, 14,042 baseball/ softball games, 559 of the Chargers 560 football games, including 493 in a row.</p>
        <p>The only football game that he missed was on Sept. 28, 1946 -- his wedding day.</p>
        <p>"I even went down to the football field on that day," Mr. Shortell laughingly remembered. "We had just gotten married and were on the way to our reception, and I stopped off in my tuxedo to wish the boys luck before the game."</p>
        <p>Mr. Shortell, a 1942 Ansonia graduate, couldn't compete in high school sports because of a hip disorder. To fill that void, he became a cheerleader for the football squad and scorekeeper for the Chargers' basketball team.</p>
        <p>He's been tracking those teams, as well as the volleyball, soccer and baseball teams, ever since.</p>
        <p>"I would have loved to play for this high school," said Mr. Shortell, resting his feet on an beat-up foot stool placed next to a box containing autographs from Jackie Robinson and Connie Mack.</p>
        <p>"But it just wasn't meant to be," he said. "Still, I know that nobody has had more involvement in this high school over the years than myself. What do most of the athletes at schools last? Four years? I'm still here, 57 years later."</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Shortell has no official title at Ansonia High School, he has been honored for his activities there with as many as 40 awards and has been the master of ceremonies at more than 500 banquets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shortell's most prominent citations include: the Sports Nut of America award presented by President Reagan in 1986, the Humanitarian award given to him in 1988 by President Bush for his work with youths and the Golden Key to his city, given to him by the Sport Writers Alliance, the first such honor bestowed upon a non-athlete or coach.</p>
        <p>In 1987, Mr. Shortell received the ultimate honor when he was voted into the Coaches Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shortell, who once umpired 11 ball games in one day, is so sports-crazed that he used to keep a transistor radio in his pocket when he worked as a second-base umpire at Ansonia 10 years ago. He just had to listen to broadcasts of his favorite team, the Yankees.</p>
        <p>"One day, I have a steal at second base," said Mr. Shortell. "So a kid slides in there and he's obviously safe. And I'm about to say 'safe,' but I hear Mel Allen say, 'He got him. He called him out.' The kid turned to me and says, 'You called me out? I'm in there, ump!' I said, 'I didn't call you out. That's some guy in the stands.' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Shortell's most memorable moment came 10 years ago at Yankee Stadium. He and his wife, Bernice, were enjoying the best seats they'd ever had at the ball park: Section 11, compliments of the Yankees public relations office.</p>
        <p>A member of the Yankees brass came over and told them that they needed to change move to make room for an unexpected celebrity who had popped in to see the game.</p>
        <p>"I was just about to tell them that I wasn't going anywhere," Mr. Shortell said, "when the whole stadium rose to their feet. And I looked over and there was General Douglas MacArthur."</p>
        <p>A father of 11 children and grandfather of 18, Mr. Shortell takes as much pride in family as he does in the Ansonia High.</p>
        <p>He smiles wide when he talks about his seven sons, all of whom played baseball, basketball and football at Ansonia.</p>
        <p>His four daughters were athletes and cheerleaders for the Big Blue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shortell himself was 14 three hip operations left him with a noticeable limp and little chance of a sports position.</p>
        <p>Almost six decades later, traces of pain can still be heard in his voice as he recalled the heartbreak of a freshman in 1937.</p>
        <p>He had made it to the last cut on junior varsity basketball team. "I was waiting for a jersey and the coach came to me and said, 'Shortell, do you want to be a part of this team?' And the first thing that I looked at was his hands and he had no jersey in it. I said, 'Yes, coach.' He said, 'I need a scorekeeper.' I said to myself, 'What?' "</p>
        <p>"Little did I know that was the best thing that ever happened to me," he continued, without a trace of bitterness.</p>
        <p>"I think what has gotten me past the adversity are the three F's -- faith, family and my friends."</p>
