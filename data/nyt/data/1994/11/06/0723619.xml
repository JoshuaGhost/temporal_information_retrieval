        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The recent disclosure of a memo by Alice Rivlin, the budget director, that raised the possibility of only the most modest revisions in Social Security caused a shameful display of ducking and covering by Democrats. Instead of using the opportunity to discuss some real solutions to our deficit and national debt dilemma, they chose not to offend the all-powerful senior citizen voting bloc.</p>
        <p>The Republicans, for their part, show themselves to be little better, with their "Contract With America." They would bring us back to the 1980's, with slashed revenue and increased spending.</p>
        <p>While Social Security and Medicare are great ideas and should always be a part of our system, they need to be rethought and overhauled. They were designed to be a safety net at a time when most elderly folks struggled and relied on others to get by. Today the elderly are demographically the most well-off age group.</p>
        <p>Everyone recognizes that we must change how we spend our money to get out from under these crushing deficits. Hence the talk of welfare reform. This is a politically popular thing to do. Social Security, health care benefits and Federal pensions, though, make up three-quarters of entitlement spending. Thus no amount of welfare reform will make a significant dent in the crisis.</p>
        <p>In addition, benefit dollars are just as likely to go to the well-off; they are disbursed without regard to financial need. And with today's longer life spans, the payback on Social Security and Medicare often exceeds what the retiree pays into the system, plus interest.</p>
        <p>I hope our elected officials of both parties have a little courage and at least talk about this most pressing of issues and possible solutions. JOHN SPENCER JR. Yonkers, Oct. 30, 1994</p>
