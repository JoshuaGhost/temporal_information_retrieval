        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Leslie Lafayette sounds like those who complain that handicapped parking spots give an advantage to persons with disabilities. The cases she cites of employees given perks for their children are extremely rare; in most cases, workers lose money and chances at promotion each time an earache, school conference or snow day causes them to lose work time. Further, her perspective on property tax is unrealistic: she is not paying tax to send our children to school; we all are paying to educate future citizens. TRACY BARRETT  Nashville, Oct. 18  The writer is a lecturer in Italian at Vanderbilt University.</p>
