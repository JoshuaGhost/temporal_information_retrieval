        <p>Trying to restore order within the Republicans' discordant house, State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, campaigned in Manhattan and on Long Island yesterday, flanked at every turn by Republicans who had feuded with him or chastised him in recent months, but who have now come around in the final days of the race.</p>
        <p>In his Manhattan headquarters yesterday morning, Mr. Pataki appeared with Herbert London, the Republican candidate for State Comptroller, who has accused Mr. Pataki of lacking substance. Yesterday he warmly praised Mr. Pataki's plan to cut personal income tax rates by 25 percent.</p>

        <p>Trying to restore order within the Republicans' discordant house, State Senator George E. Pataki, the Republican candidate for governor, campaigned in Manhattan and on Long Island yesterday, flanked at every turn by Republicans who had feuded with him or chastised him in recent months, but who have now come around in the final days of the race.</p>
        <p>In his Manhattan headquarters yesterday morning, Mr. Pataki appeared with Herbert London, the Republican candidate for State Comptroller, who has accused Mr. Pataki of lacking substance. Yesterday he warmly praised Mr. Pataki's plan to cut personal income tax rates by 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Backing off his charge of a week ago that Mr. Pataki "should lead or get out of the way," Mr. London said he thought that Mr. Pataki had shown himself to be "inspired and bold," adding, "I've seen a candidate fighting hard to win."</p>
        <p>In the afternoon, Mr. Pataki walked from the home of Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau County Republican chairman, to a strip mall in Levittown, leading a small motorcade of followers that included the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, who has also had a strained relationship with Mr. Pataki in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marino, a Republican of Oyster Bay, who has been almost invisible throughout the campaign, said yesterday that he had been ready to help Mr. Pataki for some time but that "it took them two months to find me."</p>
        <p>Later, he stood beside Mr. Pataki as the candidate addressed a small but noisy crowd outside a flea market in Levittown. Just as Mr. Marino was trying to step down from the truck, Mr. Mondello summoned him to the microphone, at which point Mr. Marino exhorted the Republican crowd in his soft voice not to let slip their first opportunity in 20 years to win back the statehouse.</p>
        <p>There has been a rift between Mr. Pataki and Mr. Marino, the most powerful Republican in state government, since 1992, when Mr. Marino was challenged by an anti-tax group that supported Mr. Pataki. This year, Mr. Marino was slow to endorse Mr. Pataki and he was accused by some Republicans of trying to undermine the candidate.</p>
        <p>Long Island, rich in Republican voters, is considered a major battleground that Mr. Pataki must win by 8 to 10 percentage points to unseat Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Republican strategists say. Yesterday they acknowledged that Mr. Pataki has been deeply hurt here by New York City's Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Republican, who has endorsed Mr. Cuomo. But they argued that Mr. Pataki had crept back into the race with his characterizations of Mr. Giuliani as a "back stabber" who had sacrificed principle to personal ambition.</p>
        <p>At his campaign stops in Levittown and Brookhaven, Mr. Pataki addressed crowds of 200 to 300 supporters in events intended by his campaign not only to energize his field workers but also to project the image for local television stations that his campaign has gained momentum and is brimming with enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>"Mario Cuomo has had his chance," Mr. Pataki said at a rally oustside Republican party headquarters in Brookhaven. "He has had his three terms. He's had three strikes. On Tuesday he'll be out."</p>
        <p>After his Long Island events, Mr. Pataki flew to Albany, where he and about 150 supporters chanted "Three more days" outside the Governor's Mansion while loudspeakers blared the theme music from the movie "Rocky," which has also been used as Cuomo theme music. Mr. Pataki was to address the crowd from atop a tractor-trailer, but the Albany city police forced him to take it away. He then crossed the street and tried to speak from the stoop of an abandoned house, but Cuomo supporters shouted him down and he cut his speech short.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said afterward that he wanted to use the speech to assure state employees that he was not planning large-scale layoffs in the state work force.</p>
        <p>"Obviously, Cuomo's people didn't want that message to get out," he said. "It's sad that they've resorted to preventing me from having my right of free speech."</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki plans to spend much of the campaign's final hours stumping in the northern part of the state, where his support is strongest. He also plans to focus on tax cuts by appearing today in Manhattan with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and at several upstate cities on Monday with former Representative Jack Kemp, both of whom are known as champions of lower taxes.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Pataki had spent much of Friday campaigning on Mr. Cuomo's opposition to the death penalty, he did little to raise the issue yesterday, beyond making passing references to Thomas Grasso, a convicted murderer whom Mr. Cuomo brought to New York State to serve a 20-year-to-life prison sentence. Mr. Grasso also faces the death penalty for a murder in Oklahoma and Mr. Pataki has said he would try to return him to that state immediately to "face his deserved justice."</p>
        <p>But even if Mr. Pataki did not work hard to raise the death penalty issue, the issue came to him. Outside the Levittown flea market, a tearful woman thrust at Mr. Pataki a photograph of her 24-year-old son, Harry Pappas Jr., who she said was slain exactly a year ago outside a Nassau County cafe where he worked as a bouncer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki promised the woman he would sign a death penalty bill and then kissed her on the forehead as reporters recorded the event.</p>
        <p>"Of course I'll support him," said the woman, Jeanette Pappas, 66, of Uniondale. "For the death penalty."</p>
