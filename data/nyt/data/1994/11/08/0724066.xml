        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While every medical resident in New York City and all their patients owe Sidney Zion an immeasurable debt (news article, Nov. 1), it should be noted that the work hours in medical fellowships (subspecialty training following residency) were largely unaffected by the Zion case.</p>
        <p>My husband is a fellow in pediatric cardiology at Columbia University's Babies Hospital and has been called upon frequently to work 50 to 60 hours without sleep. His constant sleep deprivation has caused fainting, visual problems and headaches -- not to mention the wear and tear on our family life.</p>
        <p>Patients and their families should at least be educated consumers and made aware that the highly trained people prescribing their medication, administering their anesthesia or suturing their incisions may be too tired to dial a phone number. At best, they should lobby to the Zion cause and give Mr. Zion the grassroots support his case deserves and needs. SIMA BERNSTEIN  Teaneck, N.J., Nov. 2, 1994</p>
