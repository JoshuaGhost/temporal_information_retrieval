        <p>Be honest. Isn't stuffing a bird its raison d'etre? I've heard people say they wouldn't bother with the fat and mess of a goose, if it weren't for what a goose can hold. I've heard the same thing said about ducks, pheasants and capons. I've also wondered if modern poultry techniques would have survived given the sacrifices in flavor, if not for the larger, sturdier cavity that science has devised.</p>
        <p>Considering the universal popularity of stuffing, and the prevailing tide of nutritional thought, you would think we would abandon the bird altogether and bake as much stuffing as we like, en casserole. Yet the bird remains, harboring its precious cargo like an egg. Not out of sentiment, especially, but out of utility, because a properly made stuffing is, at once, a perfume and a moisturizer that improves its host by the mere act of filling space.</p>

        <p>Be honest. Isn't stuffing a bird its raison d'etre? I've heard people say they wouldn't bother with the fat and mess of a goose, if it weren't for what a goose can hold. I've heard the same thing said about ducks, pheasants and capons. I've also wondered if modern poultry techniques would have survived given the sacrifices in flavor, if not for the larger, sturdier cavity that science has devised.</p>
        <p>Considering the universal popularity of stuffing, and the prevailing tide of nutritional thought, you would think we would abandon the bird altogether and bake as much stuffing as we like, en casserole. Yet the bird remains, harboring its precious cargo like an egg. Not out of sentiment, especially, but out of utility, because a properly made stuffing is, at once, a perfume and a moisturizer that improves its host by the mere act of filling space.</p>
        <p>The simplest stuffing -- carrots, onions and thyme, roughly chopped -- lends a faintly sweet and herbaceous taste to the fowl. This same mixture, when chopped fine along with celery, becomes that most potent of vegetable aromatics -- a mirepoix -- so popular in French and Italian kitchens alike. Stuffings made with chili on the other hand add a delicious, piquant fire.</p>
        <p>Since bread stuffings absorb drippings, they change character during the roasting, mellowing the bird while becoming more unctuous in the process. A rye bread stuffing with caraway seeds, for example, is a wonderful sponge for a rich dish like goose. Corn bread stuffings lend nuttiness to the bird, while sourdough ones insure a tart and subtle flavor.</p>
        <p>There are probably as many options for stuffings as there are personal preferences in the matter. The only caveats in making them are first, to err on the dry side (stuffing gets wetter as it cooks) and, second, to season the mixture liberally beforehand since it will inevitably be eaten alone, surreptitious bite upon bite.</p>
        <p>Though the meat of a stuffed bird is moister and more flavorful than that of an unstuffed bird, it is often soggier, too -- a disadvantage the cook might want to consider. Also, a stuffed bird takes longer to cook. A 3 1/2-pound chicken, for example, roasted at 375 degrees, requires 20 minutes per pound, rather than 15.</p>
        <p>Since the American Revolution, stuffing has gradually grown lighter, and more in keeping with the times. Fruits and vegetables have slowly replaced butter and pork, while salt has dwindled and so have eggs. Indeed, quick stuffings have upstaged slow-simmered ones, as the definition of sumptuousness has changed. Still, eternal stuffing questions remain for which there are no simple answers. For example, what is the correct proportion of fat to bread? Should you use cubed bread or bread crumbs? Are packaged crumbs an affront? These questions, like those of religion and politics are best resolved within the privacy of one's own home.  How to Roast a Bird</p>
        <p>Bring the bird to room temperature and sprinkle with salt, inside and out. Fill the cavity with stuffing (for turkey, fill the neck cavity as well), and tie the legs together with string. If cooking goose, prick all over with a fork. Place the bird in a large roasting pan and bake until it reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees at the inner thigh, pouring off the fat from time to time if it's a goose. A 3 1/2-pound chicken requires 20 minutes per pound at 375 degrees; a 10-pound capon or goose, 25 minutes per pound at 350 degrees; a 20-pound turkey 15 minutes per pound at 325 degrees. Should the bird begin to brown too soon, cover it loosely with aluminum foil. Let stand for 15 minutes before carving. Herb Bread Stuffing  2 tablespoons unsalted butter  1 medium onion, peeled and chopped  1 cup chopped celery, including leaves  1 cup chopped Italian parsley  1 tablespoon salt  1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground pepper  2 teaspoons dried thyme  1 teaspoon dried rosemary  1 teaspoon dried sage  10 cups stale bread, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, lightly toasted  3/4 cup chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned, plus more if needed.</p>
        <p>1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion and saute until soft, about 5 minutes. Add celery, parsley, salt, pepper and herbs and cook for 5 minutes. Place in a large bowl, add bread and broth and toss to combine. Let cool.</p>
        <p>2. Fill the bird loosely with stuffing; place any remaining stuffing in a casserole and moisten with additional chicken broth. Roast the bird. Bake the extra stuffing, covered, for about 30 minutes, before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: Ten cups. Oyster Stuffing  1 recipe herb bread stuffing, omitting chicken broth (see recipe)  1 pint shucked oysters, with liquid  Dash of Tabasco sauce.</p>
        <p>Make the stuffing and toss in the oysters, their liquid and Tabasco sauce. Finish as in recipe.</p>
        <p>Yield: About eleven cups.  Corn Bread-Sausage Stuffing  1 pound hot Italian sausage, thinly sliced  1 teaspoon olive oil  2 cloves garlic, peeled and</p>
        <p>minced  1 medium onion, peeled and diced  1 large red bell pepper, cored, deribbed and diced  8 cups stale corn bread crumbs  4 large scallions, green part only, thinly sliced  1 1/2 teaspoons salt  Freshly ground pepper to taste  1 cup dark beer  Chicken broth, homemade or low-sodium canned, if needed.</p>
        <p>1. Cook the sausage in a skillet over medium heat, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon. Set aside. Heat the olive oil in a medium nonstick skillet, add the garlic and onion and saute for 2 minutes. Add the red pepper and saute until just tender, about 3 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. In a large bowl, combine the corn bread crumbs, sausage and onion mixture. Toss in the scallions, salt and pepper. Stir in the beer.</p>
        <p>3. Fill the bird loosely with stuffing; place any remaining stuffing in a casserole and moisten with chicken broth. Roast the bird. Bake the extra stuffing, covered, for about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>Yield: Twelve cups. Potato-Celery Root Stuffing  6 large baking potatoes, peeled and halved  3 medium celery roots, peeled and quartered  6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces  1/2 cup chopped fresh chives or scallion greens  1 1/2 tablespoon salt  1 1/2teaspoons freshly ground</p>
        <p>pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Place potatoes and celery roots in a pot and cover with cold water. Simmer over medium heat until soft, about 30 to 40 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid. Pass potatoes through a ricer and grate the celery roots. Combine potatoes and celery roots and stir in the reserved liquid, butter, chives, salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Fill the bird loosely with stuffing; place any remaining stuffing in a casserole. Roast the bird. Bake the extra stuffing, covered, for about 30 minutes before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: Twelve cups. Three Squash Stuffing With Hazelnuts And Bourbon  1 large spaghetti squash  1 large butternut squash  2 medium acorn squash 1/2 cup bourbon  1/2 cup currants  1 cup hazelnuts, toasted, skinned and coarsely chopped  1 1/2 cups rye bread crumbs  1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary  1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage  1 tablespoon chopped fresh</p>

        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Quarter all the squash, scrape out the seeds and fibers and divide between 2 large roasting pans. Add enough water to each pan to make a depth of 1 inch. Cover with foil and bake until soft, about 1 hour. Let cool.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, warm bourbon in a saucepan, add currants and set aside. Scoop flesh from butternut and acorn squash and place in a food processor. Puree until smooth. Scrape into a large bowl. Scrape out the spaghetti squash and mix with the puree. Stir in currants with the liquid, hazelnuts, bread crumbs, herbs, salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Fill the bird loosely with stuffing; place any remaining stuffing in a casserole. Roast the bird and bake the stuffing, covered, for about 30 minutes, before serving.</p>
