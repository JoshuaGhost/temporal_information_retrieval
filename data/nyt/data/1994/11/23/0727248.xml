        <p>A HANUKKAH goose? With latkes?</p>
        <p>Those who assume that a roast goose belongs only on the holly-trimmed Dickensian table on Dec. 25 have overlooked the shtetl.</p>
        <p>In this country, latkes, or potato pancakes -- not geese -- are generally thought of as Hanukkah fare. But a well-fattened goose was a festive Eastern European Jewish tradition around Hanukkah time that crossed the Atlantic with the immigrants a century ago.</p>
        <p>"My dad always talked about his mother making a stuffed goose for the Shabbos dinner of Hanukkah," said Rabbi Jonah Gewirtz of Silver Spring, Md., using the Hebrew word for the Sabbath. "They lived in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and had chickens and geese in the back yard."</p>
        <p>Rabbi Gewirtz said the Hanukkah goose was special. "Chickens anyone can have, but a goose is a delicacy," he said. "The best Hanukkah was one with two Sabbaths, so you could have two geese."</p>
        <p>Hanukkah, also called the Feast of Lights, commemorates the miracle in ancient Jerusalem when one day's supply of oil burned in the temple for eight days. The holiday, which begins this year at sundown on Sunday, is celebrated for eight days, so it always includes at least one Saturday.</p>
        <p>When it comes to festive geese, put Dickens back on the shelf and read Sholom Aleichem, who wrote the stories on which "Fiddler on the Roof" was based. In one of his stories, called "Geese," a woman in a shtetl, as the Eastern European and Russian Jewish villages were called, vividly describes how she started fattening her geese in the early fall. "You feed them and take good care of them," she says. "Comes Hanukkah, you start killing them, and you turn geese into cash."</p>
        <p>This woman kept some 30 geese, and after they were slaughtered, she sold all but a bit of the meat, gizzards and fat, which she gave to a neighbor's children as a Hanukkah treat. She also sold the down and feathers. The fat that she rendered was sold for use at Passover the following spring. "Passover steps into the house smack in the middle of Hanukkah," she says, and even goes so far as to make her kitchen temporarily kosher for Passover before preparing the fat.</p>
        <p>In the days before commercial vegetable shortenings were sold, goose fat was important in Jewish cooking, especially in kosher homes where butter could not be used with meat. Oils were very expensive, and lard, of course, was forbidden.</p>
        <p>Zell Schulman, who lives in Cincinnati and is a consultant for Royal Kedem, a kosher wine and food company, says her grandmother made geese and saved the fat for Passover. "And she gave each of her children a down pillow when they got married," she said.</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Schulman does not keep a kosher home, she says she follows some of the traditions, like making a Hanukkah goose. "You just have to remember to order the goose in time," she said.</p>
        <p>Geese are not supermarket staples, like turkeys. Even well-stocked butchers rarely carry them except at holiday time. Geese are big fat birds and are unlikely to be popular, even as an annual treat, in the land of the fat-free.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the most recent year for which statistics are available from the Department of Agriculture, 324,472 domestic geese were sold in America. That represents a slight increase from the 311,960 in 1987 but a sharp decline from 462,436 in 1982.</p>
        <p>New York accounts for more than 25 percent of the country's goose consumption, with around 100,000 birds sold, mostly in November and December. Regular geese, sold fresh and frozen, are $2 to $5 a pound.</p>
        <p>Kosher geese, which must be plucked by hand, usually cost at least $10 a pound and are especially hard to obtain. Some kosher butchers will not even order them, and most who do need a month's notice.</p>
        <p>New breeding methods designed to increase the proportion of meat to bone and fat have improved the quality of geese on the market. And to accommodate different needs, geese are coming to market in a wider range of sizes than before, from about 7 pounds up to 15 pounds.</p>
        <p>This year, there is also very good advice for occasional or first-time goose roasters. In the November-December issue of Cook's Illustrated magazine, an article called "The Best Way to Cook a Goose" by Stephen Schmidt, a cookbook author, outlines an innovative method based loosely on the technique the Chinese use for making Peking duck.</p>
        <p>Instead of merely pricking the skin of the goose to release the fat before roasting, Mr. Schmidt pricked the skin, then plunged the bird into boiling water for about a minute. He then allowed the goose to rest, uncovered, in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before roasting it. These steps apparently tighten the skin and force out more fat as the goose cooks.</p>
        <p>The results were excellent, with the lush, tender and flavorful dark meat rimmed with crisp skin, but with relatively little fat on the bird. About a quart of fat dripped into the pan. Instead of gravy, the goose can be complemented with a tart-sweet winey dried-fruit or quince compote, or a fruit chutney.</p>
        <p>And if it's Hanukkah, there must also be latkes. Fried in the goose fat, perhaps. Why not?</p>
        <p>"The miracle of Hanukkah deals with the oil," Rabbi Gewirtz said. "It's possible that because you get so much fat from the goose it became the choice for the holiday."</p>
        <p>Roast Goose  Adapted from Cook's Illustrated</p>
        <p>Total time: About 5 hours, plus 3 days for thawing if necessary, and 1 or 2 days for drying  1 fresh or frozen roasting goose, 10 to 12 1/2 pounds total weight  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  Stuffing, if desired, or 2 to 3 apples and 2 to 3 onions</p>
        <p>1. If the goose is frozen, allow it to thaw in its original wrapper in the refrigerator for about 3 days.</p>
        <p>2. Fill a very large, deep 10-quart pot about two-thirds full of water. Bring to a boil.</p>
        <p>3. Remove the neck, the package of giblets and all excess fat from the goose. Cut off the wing tips. Using a slender skewer, make pricks in the flesh of the goose all over, about an inch apart. Make the pricks by sliding the skewer into the skin nearly horizontally, so you do not pierce the meat.</p>
        <p>4. When the water has boiled, hold the goose by one end and put it into the pot until it is partly submerged (wear rubber gloves and use a towel to protect your hands against splashes). When the water returns to a boil, carefully lift it out and turn it over to blanch the other half. Drain the goose and dry it. Place it uncovered in the refrigerator, breast side up on a rack, for at least 24 hours and up to 48 hours.</p>
        <p>5. Remove the goose from the refrigerator 1 1/2 hours before roasting. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.</p>
        <p>6. Season the goose cavity with salt and pepper. Stuff and truss it if desired, or place quartered apples and onions in the cavity. Place the goose, breast side down, on a rack in the roasting pan, and roast for 1 1/2 hours. Carefully pour off all the liquid fat from the pan, and reserve. Turn the goose breast side up and continue roasting 1 hour longer for an unstuffed bird, 1 1/2 hours for a stuffed one.</p>
        <p>7. Raise oven temperature to 425 degrees, and roast the goose about 30 minutes longer, until the skin is brown and crisp. Remove the goose from the oven, and allow it to stand for 30 minutes at room temperature. Scoop the stuffing into a serving dish, or discard the apples and onions. Carve the goose, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 905 calories, 65 grams fat, 270 milligrams cholesterol, 210 milligrams sodium (before optional salting), 75 grams protein, 0 grams carbohydrate. Rendering the Fat and Saving It for Passover</p>
        <p>THE huge globs of excess fat from the edges of the cavities of the bird should be pulled off, placed in a saucepan, cooked over low heat until completely melted, then strained into a jar or crock. The cracklings that remain in the strainer can be used as topping on salads or baked potatoes.</p>
        <p>All the fat that drips into the pan while the goose is roasting should be poured off into a bowl or crock and allowed to stand at room temperature until it turns thick and whitish. Carefully pour the white part into a jar or crock for storage, discarding all browned fat at the bottom.</p>
        <p>The excellent, silky white fat rendered from a goose can be frozen or stored in the refrigerator for months. Until Passover, in the spring, in fact.  Goose fat can be used for frying latkes or other potato dishes, or for sauteeing vegetables, meats or poultry.</p>
