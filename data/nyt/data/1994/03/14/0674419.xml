        <p>On the day after he won the Florida Derby by nearly six lengths, Holy Bull was frisky and sound.</p>
        <p>"He came out of this race the best he has ever come out of a race," said his trainer, Jimmy Croll. "The Blue Grass looks like the logical place to go."</p>
        <p>He meant the Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland in Kentucky on April 16, the final stepping stone to the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on May 7. The colt has won six of his seven starts, and he led every step of the way in the Florida Derby with no sign of the breathing problem that occurred in his only defeat three weeks ago in the Fountain of Youth.</p>
        <p>The only casualty in the field of 14 in the Florida Derby was Mr. Angel, the high-strung colt who has thrown five riders in the last month. He ran 13th in Saturday's race and later was found to have suffered pulmonary bleeding. His trainer, Marty Wolfson, said the horse would be treated with Lasix and would go back to running on turf.</p>
        <p>Ride the Rails, who finished second, will make his next start in the Arkansas Derby on April 23. Happy Alter said it was "too early to tell" where he would race Halo's Image, who ran third.</p>
