        <p>It was not a crucial game in September, it was not the Skydome and talk of a pennant race was only talk, premature talk that had been saved all winter.

        <p>It was not a crucial game in September, it was not the Skydome and talk of a pennant race was only talk, premature talk that had been saved all winter. The Yankees played the Blue Jays today for the first time since they crumbled and stumbled behind them in the final two weeks of the season and the harsh memories trickled forward.</p>
        <p>Remember how the Yankees were tied for first-place in the American League East with Toronto eight different times? Remember how the three-game series in Toronto in late September looked as if it might mean something in early September? Remember how New York's pitching fizzled and the Jays won their second straight World Series title?</p>
        <p>With their two championship trophies on display at Dunedin Stadium and some of their championship players still around, the Jays made sure the Yankees vividly remembered the frustration of second place. Although Roberto Alomar, Paul Molitor and Joe Carter did not play, Dave Stewart started while John Olerud and Devon White also played. Except for the absence of the injured Bernie Williams, New York fielded its probable opening-day lineup as the rivals clashed in a spring game for the first time in exactly seven years.</p>
        <p>"Of course," Manager Buck Showalter said, "the opposition had no bearing on what lineup we put out there."</p>
        <p>Sure, Buck. Even if the lineup configuration was accidental, it was also successful. Wade Boggs stroked three hits to end an 0-for-13 skid, Don Mattingly smoked a two-run homer and seven players had at least two hits as the Yankees hammered Stewart for 5 runs and 10 hits in 4 innings and breezed to a 12-4 victory. It was only March and it was a trite triumph that featured 5 errors and 30 hits, but somewhere and somehow, Showalter might try using this victory in some motivational manner. Well, maybe not.</p>
        <p>"It doesn't matter," said infielder Mike Gallego.</p>
        <p>Asked before the contest if it was hard not to be awestruck by the formidable Jays, Showalter bristled.</p>
        <p>"It is hard to be awestruck by them," he countered. "I wouldn't be awestruck by them in any form or fashion."</p>
        <p>In his quest for the final starting spot, Bob Ojeda was not awestruck for the first three innings before the Jays nicked him for three runs in the fourth. With the first anniversary of the March 22 boating accident that killed two of his Cleveland teammates approaching, Ojeda reiterated that he only wants to answer baseball-related questions and then left the clubhouse without speaking with reporters. Maas's Future Still Tenuous</p>
        <p>Kevin Maas played his first game after having been hobbled by an aggravating groin injury. He went without a hit in two times at bat, but his future with the Yankees remains tenuous. It had been thought that the Yankees might release Maas Tuesday, enabling them to only pay $70,833.33 of his $425,000 salary, but General Manager Gene Michael said that would not happen.</p>
        <p>"Everyone looks at that as a release date," Michael said. "I'm not looking at him like that."</p>
        <p>Once trumpeted as the next great Yankee home run hitter, Maas is now struggling for a spot on the roster.</p>
        <p>"I'm not worried about being released," Maas said. "I'm not afraid of 27 other teams possibly picking me up."</p>
        <p>The Yankees would have to pay Maas $106,250 if they release him between Feb. 15 and opening day. Michael continues dangling Maas in trade talks and claimed that the first baseman baseman/designated hitter has value. Maas, meanwhile, waits.</p>
        <p>"I'm not going to extrapolate on getting 30 homers and 100 runs batted, but I know I'm capable of it," he said. Davis Is Columbus-Bound Again</p>
        <p>Just call him Russell Davis, third baseman for the Class AAA Columbus Clippers. Again. After the Yankees revealed today that Davis's sprained right ankle was more seriously injured than originally diagnosed and that he would miss between 7 and 10 days, his return to the minors became semi-official. Davis injured his ankle during infield practice Saturday in Fort Myers, Fla., when he stepped on a ball that had deflected off his glove. Already a long shot to dent the crowded roster, Davis will have less than a week to impress the Yankees if his ankle heals on schedule. Unless there is an injury or a trade, Davis will be playing at Cooper Stadium, not Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>"I won't keep Russell here if he can't get at-bats," said Showalter. Davis, who batted .381 last spring, is 3 for 15 with no homers and no runs batted in. Mattingly Picks Kentucky</p>
        <p>Don Mattingly, a rabid college basketball fan, studies coaches and usually favors the school with the sideline teacher who most impresses him.</p>
        <p>Using this philosophy, Mattingly has chosen Rick Pitino's Kentucky Wildcats to win the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.</p>
        <p>"I hate saying that," said Mattingly, a native of Evansville, Ind. With his heart, he is picking Bob Knight's Indiana Hoosiers. "I think they're capable," said Mattingly, who was not wearing a tight red sweater, one of Knight's trademarks, as he made the remarks.  BASEBALL: NOTEBOOK</p>
