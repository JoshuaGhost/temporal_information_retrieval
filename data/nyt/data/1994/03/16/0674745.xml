        <p>Dr. David B. Simpson, who practiced as a physician and surgeon in Bayonne for more than 50 years, died yesterday at his home there. He was 85.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, said his son James Simpson.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simpson was the former chief of surgery at Bayonne Hospital and also served on the staffs of St. Francis Hospital in Jersey City and the Jersey City Medical Center. He also taught at New York University Medical School and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. He retired from surgery in 1985 and from the practice of medicine in 1990.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simpson, who retired as a colonel in the Army Reserve, was commended by the Army Surgeon General at the start of World War II for devising novel methods for transporting the wounded from the battlefield. One invention was a litter-bearing Jeep.</p>
        <p>He was a founder of the Bayonne Chamber of Commerce, the Tax Research Council of Bayonne and the Bayonne Industrial Commission.</p>
        <p>He graduated from New York University and its medical school, was an intern at St. Vincent's Hospital, and a surgical resident at the French Hospital in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Dr. Simpson is survived by his wife, Elizabeth of Bayonne; five sons, David Jr. of Bayonne, Robert of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, James of Oakland, N.J., Brian of Plymouth, Mass., and Jonathan of Houston, and two daughters, Mary Beth Sunderman of Cincinnati, and Regina Sarmini of Dallas.</p>
