        <p>Fannie Mae packages the mortgages that it buys and resells them for slightly more money and with a guarantee that Fannie Mae or the issuing financial institution will pay for mortgages that default.</p>
        <p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, better known as Freddie Mac, performs a similar role and has already expanded its financing of low-income housing in the last two years.</p>
