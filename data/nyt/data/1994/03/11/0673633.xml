        <p>British and Irish leaders said today that the search for peace in Northern Ireland would go on despite the I.R.A. attack at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday evening in which four mortar shells were fired at a runway but did not explode.</p>

        <p>British and Irish leaders said today that the search for peace in Northern Ireland would go on despite the I.R.A. attack at Heathrow Airport on Wednesday evening in which four mortar shells were fired at a runway but did not explode.</p>
        <p>Though it did not cause any casualties, the assault upon the world's busiest airport was dramatic. It was the I.R.A.'s first use of mortars on the mainland since a round crashed down on the Prime Minister's office in February 1991, and it broke a relative lull in bombings and assassinations since Britain and Ireland started a joint peace initiative on Dec. 15.</p>
        <p>[ Heathrow Airport came under mortar assault for the second time in 30 hours early Friday, but the shells failed to explode and nobody was hurt, The Associated Press reported. Scotland Yard said in a statement that a bang was heard around midnight and three unexploded mortar shells were found in the southeast area of the airport near Terminal No. 4. Authorities evacuated the terminal and closed the southern runway. The airport remained open. ]</p>
        <p>The assault on Wednesday was seen as a sign that the peace effort, which had initially aroused hopes of a settlement of the 15-year conflict, was in trouble.</p>
        <p>But the exact significance of the attack was not clear. Either the I.R.A., or a group within the I.R.A., had decided to abandon the initiative or was flexing its muscles to press the British Government into making further concessions so that it could embrace it. British Resist 'Clarification'</p>
        <p>Ever since Prime Ministers John Major of Britain and Albert Reynolds of Ireland announced the initiative, in the form of a general declaration of principles that they hoped would be acceptable to all sides, representatives of Sinn Fein, the political arm of the I.R.A., have been pressing for "clarification" of some of the points.</p>
        <p>This the British Government has been unwilling to do to any great extent, arguing that if it were to do that it would in effect be entering into negotiations. For talks to get started, it has insisted instead that the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting to expel the British from Northern Ireland, renounce violence.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A. took responsibility for the attack today in a statement that pointed out that it had given the police adequate warning but that the British authorities kept the airport open anyway. Even after the attack, the north runway, where the shells had landed, was not closed for 44 minutes -- a decision that the police and the airport authorities defended today.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, released a statement saying that his organization was still "committed to the peace process." The I.R.A. operation, he said, was far from being a setback for the peace effort. It was "a reminder that the causes of the conflict have not been removed." He called upon Mr. Major to "start talks now to end the conflict and secure a lasting peace." 'No Difference Whatsoever'</p>
        <p>Addressing the British House of Commons this afternoon, Mr. Major condemned the attack. But he went on to say, "It will make no difference whatsoever in the search for peace in Northern Ireland." In a similar vein, Mr. Reynolds, the Irish leader, vowed to the Parliament in Dublin that the initiative was still alive.</p>
        <p>The attack was apparently timed to coincide with a debate in the British Parliament over the annual renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which gives the authorities special powers to combat political violence. After a dramatic announcement of the attack to the assembled M.P.'s, the renewal passed by 86 votes.</p>
        <p>The attack came at 5:57 P.M., nearly an hour after phone calls were placed to Sky News and other offices warning that bombs would go off at Heathrow. The calls included an I.R.A. code word not known to the public, signaling that they were genuine. Though the police searched the airport it was not evacuated and flights were not held back.</p>
        <p>The homemade mortar shells were fired from four six-foot-long tubes in the back of a stolen Nissan Micra in a parking lot about 400 yards from the airport's busy north runway. A fifth tube was used to either smash the window or to detonate the car, which set four or five other vehicles ablaze.</p>
        <p>None of the four mortar rounds blew up. The police said that some explosive -- Semtex -- was found today at the runway. No one was apprehended. The police suggested that the device may have been set to go off automatically.</p>
