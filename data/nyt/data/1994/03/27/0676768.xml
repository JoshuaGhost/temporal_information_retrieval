        <p>TELLING THE TRUTH ABOUT HISTORY By Joyce Appleby, Lynn Hunt and Margaret Jacob. 322 pp. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company. $25.</p>
        <p>IS there a truth that historians can tell? Yes, in thunder, answer the authors of "Telling the Truth About History," a confident, breezy account of the historical profession's encounters with post-modernism and multiculturalism. Of course, historians are influenced by their own character and circumstances. But just because nobody can have a God's-eye view of events does not mean that historians are writers of fiction or merely the agents of particular tribes or interest groups. A genuinely diverse community of historians can neutralize the biases and compensate for the blind spots found in any person or group; the result can be history warranted widely enough to be called true.</p>
        <p>Those affirmations in this book flow from three distinguished scholars. Joyce Appleby of the University of California, Los Angeles, has worked primarily on 18th- and early 19th-century America; Lynn Hunt of the University of Pennsylvania is a specialist in modern French history, and Margaret Jacob of the New School for Social Research is a historian of science. The three speak in a single voice, in the "I work in the archives" tone of researchers unwilling to leave to theorists the task of explaining to the public the politics and cognitive mission of historians.</p>
        <p>"Telling the Truth About History" is at once a vindication of historical knowledge against skeptical and relativist doubts and a popular history of the process by which these doubts came into being. Central to both aspects of the book is the concept of absolutism. The "absolute character" of the scientific truth espoused by the Enlightenment "mimicked the older Christian truth," the authors believe; it endowed intellectuals of the modern West with the "heroic" self-conception of an "unprejudiced, dispassionate, all-seeing" investigator ready to defeat superstition, fanaticism and authoritarianism. This persona, they argue, was taken up eagerly in the 19th century by scholars developing the study of history as a profession, some of whom narrated the history of the United States as an unambiguous triumph of the Enlightenment values of freedom, equality and reason. Hence, they conclude, the 20th century inherited "absolutist" images of science, historical scholarship and American national destiny, all of which invited skeptical reassessments in the wake of the complexity of lived experience in laboratories and archives and in the American political arena.</p>
        <p>The story of the dethroning of these abso lutisms, as told somewhat melodramatically by these authors, culminates in the post-modernist denial that there can be any historical knowledge at all and in the multiculturalist rejection of a national myth that omitted the contributions and suffering of minorities and women. The authors celebrate these revolts as healthy and necessary steps toward a more accurate and sophisticated understanding of science, history and the United States. But they sensibly lament an extremity they attribute to the legacy of absolutism: Once the old faiths are shaken, chaos reigns. It's all or nothing. We have knowledge or we have a multitude of competing fictions. We have the old patriotic narrative of American progress or we have a host of stories about different groups driven by particularist sensibilities.</p>
        <p>Pragmatism to the rescue! The critical spirit of the Enlightenment can be reawakened, the authors believe, but purged of the absolutisms that have so long haunted it. Although Ms. Appleby, Ms. Hunt and Ms. Jacob sometimes speak of presenting a new way of thinking about objectivity that is suitable for a democratic society, they acknowledge in their wiser moments that their "late-20th-century understanding of historical truth" owes much to that venerable defender of science and democracy, John Dewey, and even to ideas "available since the 1860's" in the writings of the philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce. Avoiding the naive expectations that cause many of our problems in talking about historical objectivity, pragmatists understand that all knowledge can be "provisional" even though some of it may conceivably prevail "for centuries, perhaps forever." Pragmatists see truth as emerging from "a consensus of practitioners" in a social process of open struggle waged amid objects real enough to resist some of our interpretations and to confirm others.</p>
        <p>These three authors sharpen their pragmatic realism by making good use of the recent work of the philosopher Hilary Putnam, and they rightly insist that a consensus-based theory of truth is more defensible if the group of inquirers is genuinely open to women and minorities. Despite these whiffs of contemporary thought, the doctrinal core of "Telling the Truth About History" is a pragmatic realism long since appreciated by many historians in the United States. Making this pragmatic realism more accessible to the public is the greatest contribution of this book. It will no doubt serve also to help undergraduates majoring in history find their way through the post-modernist debates.</p>
        <p>It offers less when the authors turn to multiculturalism. Here their admirable effort to update the critical spirit of the Enlightenment loses the sharpness of focus they maintain when they deal with epistemological issues. Their hortatory calls for "an act of national will" to create a comprehensive narrative of inclusion provide little help in determining the terms on which this inclusion is to proceed. "Only the critical relationship between the whole, with its authority, moral force and material wealth, and each particular group, insistent upon its share, its place and its rights within the whole, can make the multicultural debate intelligible," they insist in a characteristically bland formulation.</p>
        <p>They attack a complacent, Anglo-centered historiography recounting "the progress of natural rights and democratic governance," which historians have already spent a quarter-century trying to transcend. Perhaps the battle against the old patriotic narrative is never won, but in the guise of a ringing manifesto for a history more responsive to the social diversity of the nation, "Telling the Truth About History" defends what is already the most widely proclaimed of agendas for the telling of the truth about American history.
