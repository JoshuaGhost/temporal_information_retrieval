        <p>HISTORY: The four 1,200-pound bronze eagles at the Grand Army Plaza entrance to Prospect Park are being removed for cleaning as part of a $1.3 million renovation project. The sculputres were installed nearly 100 years ago and have never been cleaned. REMOVAL: Last Tuesday workers cut a hole in the sphere under each eagle to reach the corroding cast-iron stanchions achoring the sculptures, freeing the eagles. CLEANING: The eagles were taken to the Modern Art Foundry in Long Island City, Queens. Workers will blast them with tiny glass beads or crushed walnut shells. HOME BASE: The project should be finished in August. (Source: TProspect Park Alliance Capital Projects)</p>
