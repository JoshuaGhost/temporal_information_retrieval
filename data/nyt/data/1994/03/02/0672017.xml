        <p>Even a month ago, it might not have happened. But when NATO spotters caught six Serbian warplanes blatantly violating the United Nations ban on military flights over Bosnian airspace Monday, they acted. American F-16 fighters pursued them, warned them, and when the warnings were ignored, shot four of the Serbian planes down.</p>
        <p>Technically, it was the first combat operation ever staged by the 44-year-old NATO alliance. It will, if nothing else, add credibility to future NATO warnings.</p>
        <p>Finally enforcing the flight ban is thus a step forward. But it is a relatively modest one that could be taken without directly confronting the international and political complications that stand in the way of more decisive solutions.</p>
        <p>The Serbs' advantage in the two-year-old fighting does not come from their air superiority, but from their overwhelming advantage in tanks and heavy guns. This crucial difference has been reinforced by a perverse U.N. embargo on arms imports that in practice only affects one side -- Bosnia's legal Government.</p>
        <p>But Britain, France and Russia, all with U.N. vetoes, adamantly oppose modifying that embargo so the Bosnians could defend themselves without outside involvement. And Russia now seems intent on blocking any new United Nations authorizations for combat, even limited ones, although it voiced no objection to Monday's air shootdown, which was based on previously granted U.N. authority.</p>
        <p>The Clinton White House portrays Monday's shootdown as evidence that NATO has found the will to back its military threats. But this was an unusually easy military problem and is not a useful guide for the more complicated challenges ahead.</p>
        <p>Even as the F-16's blasted their targets, new evidence was emerging that Bosnian Serb forces blatantly defied last month's NATO ultimatum on Sarajevo by concealing tanks. Those Serbian tanks, hidden within the Sarajevo "exclusion zone," moved out this week to join the siege of two other Government-held cities, Maglaj and Tuzla.</p>
        <p>Effective international policy continues to be thwarted by the competing interests of major European powers. With Britain, France and Russia effectively shielding the Serbs, and the U.S. doing what it can on behalf of the Muslim-led Government, the U.S. is now putting pressure on the third party to the struggle, the Croats, whose traditional protector, Germany, finds it impolitic to stand up to the other powers.</p>
        <p>The latest U.S. peace initiative seeks to compensate the Bosnian Government for some of its losses to the Serbs by territorial and political concessions from the Croats. That does little to ease the pressure on the Serb-surrounded cities of eastern Bosnia where a substantial portion of the Muslim population still lives and thus offers scant hope of a stable, enforceable peace.</p>
