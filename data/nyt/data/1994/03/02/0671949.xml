        <p>AGING baby boomers and millions of other Americans both older and younger received reassuring news last month: the coloring that many use to hide that telltale gray or to give themselves a fresh new look may be a lot safer than previous reports had suggested.</p>
        <p>The newest finding, as reported recently in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, was said in an editorial to show "conclusively that use of permanent hair dyes does not increase risk of cancer mortality."</p>
        <p>"Even long use of hair dye -- for 20 or more years -- does not increase the total risk of death from cancer," Dr. Graham A. Colditz, associate professor at both the Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, wrote in the editorial.</p>
        <p>The exonerating study that Dr. Colditz commented on examined the use of permanent hair dyes and the development of "selected fatal cancers" among 573,369 women who have been participating in an extensive cancer prevention study conducted by the American Cancer Society. The study, now more than a decade old, is exploring the relationship between a laundry list of living habits and the risk of dying of cancer among more than one million Americans.</p>
        <p>In 1982, when they enrolled in the study, the women -- all 30 and older -- told volunteer interviewers about their use of hair dyes, including the color, type and length of use. Then the researchers, led by Dr. Michael J. Thun of Atlanta, where he is director of analytic epidemiology for the cancer society, measured death rates from cancer among the women through 1989.</p>
        <p>Basically, they found no overall increase in cancer deaths among users of hair dyes. Nor did they see any specific relationship between dye use and cancers of the breast, bladder, brain, reproductive organs, mouth and throat or respiratory and digestive systems. When the researchers took into account cigarette smoking and a host of other factors that can influence cancer risk, hair dye use showed no relation to cancer deaths among the women studied.</p>
        <p>Even use of hair dyes for 20 years or more was not associated with an increased chance of dying of any of these cancers. Much to everyone's surprise, the risk of death from cancers of the urinary system, which had long been an area of concern among hair-dye users, actually declined as the women's use of dyes extended from a period of one to nine years to a period of 20 or more years.</p>
        <p>But hair dyes did not receive a totally clean bill of health in the study. As in previous studies, there was a worrisome suggestion that prolonged use of dark dyes, particularly black dye, might increase the risk of developing two potentially fatal cancers: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thun and his colleagues were quick to point out, though, that this one black mark against hair dyes involved only five cancer deaths, a tiny fraction of the total number of cancer deaths and an even tinier fraction of cancers that developed in the study group. Furthermore, the researchers reported, "among women who used permanent hair dyes, only six-tenths of 1 percent had used black hair dye for 20 or more years," the period that suggested an increase in risk for those two cancers of the hematopoietic system, which involves the tissues of the blood and lymph systems.</p>
        <p>Still, the researchers said, "although generally negative, the results were consistent with those of previous case-control studies and suggested that prolonged use of the most concentrated hair dyes may pose some risk." Neither case-control studies, which question cancer patients about their past exposures, nor the present cancer society study can reveal a cause-and-effect relationship. Rather, they raise questions that require more definitive research.</p>
        <p>The new cancer society analysis was undertaken at the request of the National Cancer Institute, which had done a case-control study two years ago that suggested a possible link between hair dye use and a slightly increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in women. The new findings are similar to those of another well-controlled study, the continuing Nurses' Health Study, which has been conducted since 1976 among 121,700 nurses.</p>
        <p>The nurses' study has thus far found no overall increase in cancer risk among users of hair dyes, and a preliminary analysis has produced "very reassuring evidence" about hair dyes and cancers of the blood and lymph systems, said its director, Dr. Charles Hennekens of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.  Decades of Concern</p>
        <p>Americans have been worried about hair dyes since 1975, when an extensive study by Dr. Bruce Ames of the University of California at Berkeley found that permanent hair dyes contained many compounds that damaged genes and therefore might increase the risk of cancer. Dr. Ames examined the various hair dye compounds using a bacterial test that carries his name, the Ames test, which is widely used to screen chemicals for mutagenicity, or the ability to damage genes.</p>
        <p>Many mutagens are also carcinogens; the genetic damage they do results in uncontrolled cellular growth. In the case of hair dyes, which can penetrate the skin when applied to the scalp, Dr. Ames was particularly alarmed by his results because many of the colorants are derived from coal tars, which are known to be carcinogenic. And, indeed, various animal tests using very high doses of dyes indicated that permanent hair dyes might be carcinogenic. These results prompted the cosmetics industry to stop using several of the compounds that were most suspect.</p>
        <p>In the years since the Ames report, there have been many widely publicized studies of the use of dyes by women who developed various cancers. Most of the studies suggested that risks of one or another cancer, including cancers of the breast, blood and lymph organs, were increased by long-term use of hair dyes. But what was lacking was consistency in the findings, and there was a frequent failure to take into account known risk factors for cancer, like smoking.  How to Proceed</p>
        <p>Baby boomers were, on average, a decade later than their mothers in deciding to cover their graying strands. The previous generation became alarmed in their mid 30's, but the baby boomers waited until their 40's to try to turn back the clock cosmetically. Now, after a decade of stagnation, hair dye sales in the 1990's are booming, for men as well as for women. Fully one-third of women (and fewer than 10 percent of men) color their hair with permanent dyes, according to industry estimates.</p>
        <p>Those who are reluctant to take any risks pending the outcome of future studies would be wise to stay away from the very dark, intense, permanent hair colorings. Or they might try the semipermanent dyes that wash out in a month or so. Still another approach is to use a rather challenging technique of applying the dye only to the strands of hair, without allowing any to touch the scalp.</p>
