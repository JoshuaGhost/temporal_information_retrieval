        <p>ONE THOUSAND years ago, a woman in southern Peru died at the age of 40 to 45 and was buried in a stone tomb in a river valley near what is now the coastal community of Ilo. As sometimes happened in the desiccated climate of the Atacama Desert, her body dried out and was spontaneously mummified. Now, modern scientists have come along and conducted a revealing post-mortem examination of the well-preserved body.</p>
        <p>Their research offers new evidence that pre-Columbian Americans may already have been infected with some of the devastating diseases that were thought to have been brought to the New World by Columbus and other early explorers.</p>
        <p>In the mummy's right lung and a lymph node, the scientists found scars of disease. These were small, calcified lesions typical of tuberculosis. Extracting fragments from the tissue, molecular biologists isolated genetic material betraying the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The woman probably died of something else, but she had harbored the infectious agents of the dreaded communicable disease.</p>
        <p>"This provides the most specific evidence possible for the pre-Columbian presence of human tuberculosis in the New World," the scientists are reporting today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>The findings add to the growing knowledge about the health of the American Indians before Europeans arrived, coughing, sneezing and otherwise spreading Old World microbes with deadly consequences. The research was also the first clearly successful application of a new technology for investigating the infections that plagued prehistoric people.</p>
        <p>For medical historians the results pose the problem of explaining how tuberculosis, thought to have evolved only in the pre-Columbian Old World in association with the domestication of cattle, could have arisen in the Americas centuries before 1492. Cows in the New World were an early import from Europe.</p>
        <p>For anthropologists the existence of tuberculosis in prehistoric Peru serves as important indirect evidence of living conditions in a society that many centuries earlier had made the transition from migratory hunter-gatherers to the sedentary life of agriculture. Tuberculosis is an opportunistic disease. It strikes when times are tough, often overwhelming the bodies of people already weakened by malnutrition, poor sanitation in crowded urban centers and debilitated immune systems.</p>
        <p>Although there had been some previous evidence for tuberculosis among prehistoric Americans, it was based largely on lesions in bones that could have been caused by other afflictions, like fungi and parasites, as well as tuberculosis. The new findings, anthropologists said, appeared to be unambiguous and should end any lingering debate.</p>
        <p>The paleopathologist who conducted the autopsy on the Peruvian mummy was Dr. Arthur C. Aufderheide of the School of Medicine at the University of Minnesota at Duluth. Dr. Wilmar L. Salo, a molecular biologist at Duluth, performed the genetic analysis. Co-authors of their report were Dr. Jane Buikstra and Dr. Todd A. Holcomb, anthropologists at the University of Chicago who excavated the mummy in 1990.</p>
        <p>The excavation was part of a comprehensive archeological survey of the Chiribaya, a farming people who occupied the lower Osmore River valley from about A.D. 1000 to 1300. They were descendants of people who had moved at least 2,000 years earlier from the highlands into such coastal valleys, where Andean meltwater flowed through the desert to the Pacific Ocean. They settled in villages, worked irrigated fields and produced distinctive textiles and ceramics.</p>
        <p>The Chiribaya ceramics disappeared before the rise of the Inca Empire, which occurred in the Andes about a century before European contact, but other cultures continued in the valley, perhaps under Incan hegemony.</p>
        <p>About five miles inland from the sea, the archeologists found a cluster of nine cemeteries and opened 600 graves, at least one-fourth of which contained naturally mummified bodies. They called in Dr. Aufderheide, who for more than a decade has specialized in studies of mummies from the desert of southern Peru and northern Chile, seeking new ways to determine the health of these ancient people.</p>
        <p>In one of the 140 mummies he examined, Dr. Aufderheide detected no skeletal abnormalities or any evidence of disease in the heart, liver, bowel or other preserved soft tissue -- until he inspected the intact, collapsed lungs. He immediately noticed the lesions and decided to make a more detailed study of the woman, who, according to radiocarbon dating of liver tissue, died 1,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>As a pathologist, Dr. Aufderheide suspected tuberculosis. Typically, the disease spreads when people inhale the infectious microbes. In an otherwise healthy person, the body's defenses envelope the infection in scar tissue, containing the disease and preventing its spread.</p>
        <p>For at least 9 of 10 people, nothing more happens and they probably never know that they have experienced a case of primary TB. Only when the body's defenses break down under the stress of malnutrition or other disease do the microbes become aggressive, resulting in the more serious, and possibly fatal, disease of secondary TB, with symptoms including persistent coughing, weight loss, fever and bloody sputum.</p>
        <p>Since there was no evidence of skeletal deformities associated with a full-blown case, Dr. Aufderheide concluded that the woman's disease had been contained. He could not determine the cause of death from the parts of the body that were well preserved.</p>
        <p>Because previous evidence of pre-Columbian tuberculosis has been controversial, the researchers decided to submit some of the lesion tissue to a test using a technique known as polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R. From minute amounts of tissue, the technology creates billions of copies of some selected segment of DNA, the genetic material.</p>
        <p>Analyzing these results, Dr. Salo determined that inside the lesions were preserved "a DNA segment unique to Mycobacterium tuberculosis" and that the lesions were caused by that infection. The scientists said they took precautions against contamination in the laboratory tests.</p>
        <p>"This is the ultimate in identity," Dr. Aufderheide said in a telephone interview. "It's the first time anyone has reported using this technique in ancient material to identify an infectious agent." Breakthrough Is Seen</p>
        <p>Dr. John W. Verano, an anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution who is co-editor of "Disease and Demography in the Americas" (Smithsonian Institution Press, 1992), said he had a high regard for Dr. Aufderheide's research. "It's a pretty major breakthrough," he said. "The case is now closed on the presence of tuberculosis in pre-Columbian America."</p>
        <p>Of particular interest to some scientists and scholars is the success of the new research tool. In trying to reconstruct prehistoric health, scientists have relied mainly on an examination of bones for the residual effects of malnutrition, leprosy, syphilis and arthritis. An X-ray of teeth and bones can reveal major body insults, as from starvation and widespread infection. A chemical examination of mummy hair has disclosed that as early as 2,000 years ago, the Chiribaya were habitual users of cocaine. Some biochemical tests of bones can show what kind of plants people ate. Fossilized feces and buried refuse also provide insights into diet.</p>
        <p>"We're just getting to the point where we know what kind of methods can give us information," Dr. Aufderheide said. "The DNA technique has enormous potential. We're certain scientific information is there and is extractable."</p>
        <p>Anthropologists are only beginning to assess the implications of the new findings. "It tells us that TB, one of the major diseases worldwide today, may have evolved in America independently of the Old World," Dr. Verano said.</p>
        <p>Tuberculosis is thought to have originated in animals as cowpox and crossed over to humans when cattle were domesticated. This occurred in the Middle East about 8,000 years ago. Since there were no large domesticated animals in the pre-Columbian New World, except for the llama, which is not related to cattle, scholars once doubted that tuberculosis could have been present there before the coming of Europeans.</p>
        <p>They were encouraged in this thinking by the devastating outbreak of the disease among American Indians after 1492. Epidemics of smallpox and measles more than decimated the Indian population because these diseases were new to them and their immune systems were unprepared. And so, it seemed, it was with tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>"In retrospect, this was an inappropriate interpretation," Dr. Aufderheide said. "The native Americans had so much TB in early colonial times probably because they were crowded into towns and reservations and had much poorer living conditions than before." Origins of TB in Americas</p>
        <p>Dr. Donald J. Ortner, acting director of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington and a specialist in paleopathology, said the simplest explanation of the origins of tuberculosis in the New World was that it was introduced by much earlier migrants from the Old World.</p>
        <p>The peopling of America from Asia by way of the Bering land bridge began before the end of the Ice Age more than 11,000 years ago, and thus before tuberculosis. But subsequent migrants must have come across the Bering Sea by boats or over the winter ice. They could have been carriers of the infection.</p>
        <p>However the disease appeared, it had settled into the bodies of prehistoric Americans like the Peruvian mummy, sometimes damaging their bones and leaving scars on their lungs. Perhaps this was the price of what might be called progress.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marvin Allison, a specialist in prehistoric disease at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond, was one of the first to identify the likely presence of tuberculosis in early American Indians of Peru and Chile. This was more evidence, he said, that the adoption of a sedentary life and intensification of agricultural production was not necessarily a healthful development, in part because of crowding and sanitation problems.</p>
        <p>Writing a decade ago, Dr. Allison said, "It would appear that the larger political organizations of pre-Columbian times, the last of which was the Inca, were able to store and distribute agricultural products to provide a less than optimal diet to a large potential labor force, but at the expense of its health."</p>
