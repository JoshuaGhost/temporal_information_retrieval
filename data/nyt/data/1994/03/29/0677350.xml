        <p>Martin Sulik's "Everything I Like" begins and ends at the same spot, a serene waterfront setting where Tomas (Juraj Nvota) pauses to collect his thoughts. Using these scenes as visual bookends, Mr. Sulik's rueful, quixotic film spends the rest of its time identifying the major landmarks in Tomas's life. This appealing Slovakian film is more wistful than dramatic, but Mr. Sulik's direction recalls the poetic delicacy of Czechoslovak cinema at its best. "Don't play what I sing, I haven't got a good ear," Tomas tells his son, summing up the film's intuitive spirit. "Play what's in my head."</p>
        <p>Tomas's head is filled with a lifelike array of unmade choices and unresolved family problems. The very ordinariness of the issues he contemplates gives them a certain inviting familiarity, which Mr. Sulik explores with quiet precision. "Everything I Like" offers a drily witty amalgam of minor crises, tied together by the director's eccentric overview and by Tomas's bemused outlook on his own troubles. When he decides to stop eating during the period spanned by this story, Tomas is tackling the situation about as actively as he knows how.</p>

        <p>Martin Sulik's "Everything I Like" begins and ends at the same spot, a serene waterfront setting where Tomas (Juraj Nvota) pauses to collect his thoughts. Using these scenes as visual bookends, Mr. Sulik's rueful, quixotic film spends the rest of its time identifying the major landmarks in Tomas's life. This appealing Slovakian film is more wistful than dramatic, but Mr. Sulik's direction recalls the poetic delicacy of Czechoslovak cinema at its best. "Don't play what I sing, I haven't got a good ear," Tomas tells his son, summing up the film's intuitive spirit. "Play what's in my head."</p>
        <p>Tomas's head is filled with a lifelike array of unmade choices and unresolved family problems. The very ordinariness of the issues he contemplates gives them a certain inviting familiarity, which Mr. Sulik explores with quiet precision. "Everything I Like" offers a drily witty amalgam of minor crises, tied together by the director's eccentric overview and by Tomas's bemused outlook on his own troubles. When he decides to stop eating during the period spanned by this story, Tomas is tackling the situation about as actively as he knows how.</p>
        <p>Tomas can't decide what to do about Ann (Gina Bellman), his alluring English girlfriend, who gets along with him beautifully but is gently pressuring him to accompany her when she leaves Prague. (Ann is also tutoring him in English, which allows Mr. Sulik an early scene in which Tomas plays rapist just to try out his command of English vernacular.) Meanwhile, Tomas has an ex-wife, Magda (Zdena Studenkova), who refers to Ann spitefully as "the American" and has never quite disappeared from his life. Magda has an unnerving habit of breaking into Tomas's apartment whenever Tomas leaves town.</p>
        <p>Tomas' son, Andrej (Jakub Ursiny), is approaching puberty in ways that Tomas finds utterly confounding.  The boy's flirtation with Ann, his potential stepmother, is rendered with particularly wry sensitivity. In one scene, after closing a door to escape his father's prying eyes, Andrej is seen with Ann, dancing a madly exuberant can-can, a giddy celebration of his sexual awakening. Tomas, having of course opened the door to see what he's missing, finds this so unexpected that he can only look on in wonder.</p>
        <p>In addition, Tomas is privy to the sexual secrets of his father, who shows up in town one day and is found in bed with a young woman who doesn't speak his language. The father (Anton Sulik) cannot communicate with this one-night stand at all, but he claims that she was selling him a vacuum cleaner. "Everything I Like" is capricious enough to make sure that there actually is a vacuum cleaner in the scene. It's also serious enough to carry a sting when Tomas's father chides him for making such a mess of his life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sulik presents this story in discrete, separately titled segments, which allows him some necessary detachment. Told more straightforwardly, it might seem light and prosaic; this way, the film maker's overview shapes the material and lends it substance and originality. Mr. Sulik also includes a couple of scenes featuring Jiri Menzel, the director whose 1967 "Closely Watched Trains" exemplifies the flowering of Czechoslovak cinema, and who presides over this film (in the role of a renowned intellectual) as if bestowing a benediction. In the category of wild card references, "Everything I Like" also finds ways of incorporating the Beatles, Buster Keaton and Andy Warhol's mother.</p>
