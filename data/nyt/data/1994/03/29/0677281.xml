        <p>Federal investigators said today that they had found huge variations in the approval and denial of Medicare claims for the same services in different states. And they said there were no obvious reasons for the disparities.</p>
        <p>Auditors from the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, examined claims that Medicare rejected on the ground that the services were unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who ordered the audit, said, "This evidence has great implications for the debate about national health care reform.</p>
        <p>"As part of health care reform," he said, "Congress is considering a standard national benefits package for all Americans. But the new report shows that enacting legislation is not enough to insure uniform coverage. Medicare coverage seems to depend more on where the elderly live than on their medical needs." Public Claims, Private Judges</p>
        <p>For doctor's office visits, Medicare denied 4 claims for every 10,000 approved in Northern California, while it denied 97 for every 10,000 approved in Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>An older woman whose doctor prescribed a diagnostic mammogram to detect breast cancer was 180 times more likely to have a claim denied in Southern California than in Northern California or in North Carolina, the auditors said.</p>
        <p>Likewise, for angioplasty, a technique for opening clogged blood vessels, Medicare denied 1,824 claims as unnecessary for every 10,000 approved in Southern California. Denial rates in North Carolina and Wisconsin were about 300 per 10,000. But in South Carolina and Illinois, Medicare did not reject any claims for this service in 1992.</p>
        <p>The report, prepared for a Congressional hearing on Tuesday, highlights a little-known fact about Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 36 million elderly and disabled people. Claims are reviewed and paid by private insurance companies serving as agents of the Federal Government, and their standards vary from place to place. 'A Crazy Quilt'</p>
        <p>In an interview tonight, Mr. Wyden, a co-director of Oregon Gray Panthers, said: "Most people think of Medicare as a Federal program with uniform benefits nationwide. But we are learning that Medicare is really a crazy quilt of separate and dramatically different programs run by 34 private insurance carriers."</p>
        <p>The carriers last year reviewed 576 million claims submitted by 780,000 doctors and 136,000 suppliers under Part B of Medicare.</p>
        <p>Carol Walton, director of Medicare program operations at the Federal Health Care Financing Administration, said that she had not seen the report by the General Accounting Office. But she said the regional disparities did not necessarily indicate a problem. The disparities, she said, reflect "variations in populations, disease rates and medical practice" in different parts of the country.</p>
        <p>Eleanor Chelimsky, a G.A.O. official who supervised the study, suggested several reasons for the disparities. Different carriers use different definitions of what is medically necessary, she said. In addition, she said, medical practice, billing practices and even levels of fraud vary in different parts of the country.</p>
        <p>Katy Samiljan of the Medicare Beneficiaries Defense Fund, an advocacy group in New York City, asserted that "Medicare carriers are denying coverage to patients in an arbitrary and irrational manner." As a result, she said, many people in poor health who are living on small fixed incomes do not receive the medical care they need.</p>
        <p>Ms. Samiljan said the Government gave Medicare carriers too much discretion to decide whether services were needed. The insurance company employees who review claims for the Government "generally do not have the skills, the time or the medical documentation" needed to make such decisions, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyden said the Government should consider fining Medicare carriers that improperly deny large numbers of claims.</p>
