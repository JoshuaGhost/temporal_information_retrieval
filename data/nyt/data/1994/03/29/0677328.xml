        <p>One of the Silicon Valley's respected computer designers, Carol Peters, and a well-known Hollywood producer, Jeff Apple, have formed a company to produce an interactive television network for children.</p>
        <p>The company, to be called DaVinci Time and Space, will have offices in the Silicon Valley and in Los Angeles. It will develop a computerized television service blending variations of a Disneyland-style electronic theme park and a television show like "Sesame Street" for young viewers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Peters and Mr. Apple said they intended to fill a need for programming beyond video-on-demand and interactive television shopping.</p>
        <p>The venture has so far raised $5 million from Oak Investment Partners, the Greylock Management Corporation and Venrock Associates, and it says it expects to spend $30 million to $40 million to establish the new service. Its aim is to create interactive television services that will be in cable television trials around the country through 1994 and into 1995.</p>
        <p>Such services will presumably erode traditional notions of watching one channel at a time. In contrast to conventional on-demand video offerings, DaVinci would provide a computerized "space," in which young viewers could play games, watch videos, learn or simply hang out with other children with similar access to interactive cable systems. Viewers will control their television sets with a special remote device. Partners' Background</p>
        <p>"The programming is what will be the key to interactive television," said Mr. Apple, who will be co-chief executive of the new company. He has previously headed his own Los Angeles-based television production company, Apple Productions. In 1993, Mr. Apple was a producer of Clint Eastwood's "In the Line of Fire."</p>
        <p>Ms. Peters spent 16 years at the Digital Equipment Corporation as a computer designer and more recently was director of engineering at Silicon Graphics. She led a design team there in developing a low-cost graphics work station called the Indigo, which is used in multimedia.</p>
        <p>She said she believed that the development of similar specialized services for all kinds of audiences was inevitable, given the new interactive technology.</p>
        <p>Several analysts said a risk for this kind of service was that it might be too far ahead of the available technology. But they also said that young viewers would be its first enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>"Kids are really accustomed to cyberspace," said Denise Caruso, editorial director of the Technology and Media Group, which publishes an industry newsletter. "This whole notion of virtual community is something that adults marvel at, but it's like breathing to kids."</p>
        <p>Analysts note that commercial delivery services still do not exist, and beyond that, there is a good deal of skepticism about whether consumers will be willing to pay a premium price for the ability to shop at home or dial a movie from a digital-film library.</p>
        <p>The DaVinci team said it planned to sell advertising time on the new service so that it could be provided free to users. It said it would not use interactive technology to sell products directly to children.</p>
        <p>"I know that would be crossing the line," Mr. Apple said.</p>
