        <p>LIKE the griots who roamed African villages telling tall tales and recounting tribal histories, today's black artists and designers are also sending cultural messages, with clay, iron, wood and textiles. "Much of our past is embodied in what we create," said Bing Davis, the chairman of the art department at Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, and curator of "Uncommon Beauty in Common Objects: The Legacy of African-American Craft Art," which opens on March 17 at the American Craft Museum.</p>

"Much of our past is embodied in what we create," said Bing Davis, the chairman of the art department at Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, and curator of "Uncommon Beauty in Common Objects: The Legacy of African-American Craft Art," which opens on March 17 at the American Craft Museum.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is considered one of the most comprehensive displays of black American craft and includes more than 100 examples. Ancestral references abound, from David MacDonald's 30-inch-tall "Ceremonial Bowl," reminiscent of the Akwa sacred stool of Nigeria, to Yvonne Edwards Tucker's spirit vessels honoring modern deities like B. B. King, shown at left. The show will run until June 12. The museum is at 40 West 53d Street. Lectures and workshops will also be held. Telephone: (212) 956-3535.  CURRENTS</p>
