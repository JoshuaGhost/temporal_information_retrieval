        <p>Walking past coiled firemen's hoses that had been used to wash away rivulets of blood, members of an Israeli inquiry board went into the Cave of the Patriarchs today and traced the path of the Jewish settler who had massacred Muslim worshipers there.</p>
        <p>An extraordinary security cordon was thrown around Hebron during their visit, deepening the sense of siege for Arab residents who have been under curfew almost nonstop since the settler, Dr. Baruch Goldstein, went on his rampage on Feb. 25.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of soldiers and border policemen patrolled rooftops and ringed the religious shrine, holy to both Jews and Muslims, as the five panel members spent four hours inspecting the killing ground, which has been declared off limits to regular visitors. The Blood Is Removed</p>
        <p>What they saw, Government spokesmen said, was a worshiping area for Muslims that the Israeli army had already hosed down and cleansed of blood. Islamic elders complained to the commission members that because the army had ignored a request to postpone the cleaning, they did not see the full horror of what had happened when Dr. Goldstein sprayed the mosque with automatic rifle fire, leaving a death toll that the army puts at 29.</p>
        <p>Still, panel members led by Israel's Chief Justice, Meir Shamgar, took a close look at the cave on the second day of its investigation into the bloodiest incident in the occupied territories since Israel captured them in 1967. They entered by way of the same staircase taken by Dr. Goldstein, passing a sign that said in Hebrew, English and Arabic, "Please preserve the sanctity of the site."</p>
        <p>Journalists were allowed inside the shrine, believed to be the burial place of Abraham, Sarah and other Old Testament figures. But they were confined to a long stone-floor corridor near the main entrance. Thus, they could not accompany the commission members, who walked through a narrow arched door leading to the Abraham Hall, where 13 Jews were worshiping before dawn that fateful morning, and the Isaac Hall, where 400 to 500 Muslims were said to have been kneeling in prayer when the killer entered.</p>
        <p>According to Government spokesmen, the Shamgar group was told by an army lieutenant who had been on duty that, after the massacre, soldiers found a purple bag that belonged to Dr. Goldstein and contained a "letter of confession." The contents of the letter were not disclosed, so it was unclear if it was substantially different from a suicide note that the doctor, who was beaten to death by worshipers, had left behind in the neighboring settlement of Qiryat Arba where he lived.</p>
        <p>Panel members reportedly also heard from the lieutenant that Dr. Goldstein was driven to the cave by an unknown man and dropped off, and that soldiers had seen him enter wearing protective ear cups, presumably to muffle the sounds of the rampage that was about to take place.</p>
        <p>Why soldiers would not question someone walking into a religious shrine wearing protection often associated with a shooting gallery was not explained. But senior officials argued that the confession letter, the note left in Qiryat Arba and being dropped off at the cave all suggested that he knew he was on a one-way journey. Insurance Was Increased</p>
        <p>In an added twist on this theme, the newspaper Yediot Ahronot reported that two days before the carnage at the mosque Dr. Goldstein had gone to a bank to increase his life-insurance coverage by about $80,000.</p>
        <p>An army investigation, summed up for the commission on Tuesday by the army commander for the West Bank, Maj. Gen. Danny Yatom, contends that the doctor had acted alone, firing about 110 bullets from his Galil automatic rifle and turning the Isaac Hall into a maelstrom of panic and death.</p>
        <p>The lieutenant who briefed the panel members, identified only as Rotem, said that he had tried to enter the hall, but that his path was blocked by worshipers. As he went back to his original post, he reportedly said, the shooting ended. He then returned to the hall with army reinforcements who had arrived. Hall Cleared Out</p>
        <p>In all, Government spokesmen quoted him as saying, about three minutes had elapsed after the shooting began. During that brief period, he reportedly said, the Isaac Hall was empty -- cleared of bodies, wounded and worshipers -- except for Dr. Goldstein, who lay dead in a corner.</p>
        <p>Despite the Israeli authorities' insistence that the doctor was a lone "lunatic" -- as the disciple of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane is routinely described -- some Palestinians in Hebron continue to assert that soldiers had joined him in shooting at worshipers.</p>
        <p>This charge has been repeatedly denied by the army. It says that all the Muslims in the mosque were killed by the same gun, Dr. Goldstein's, and that five deaths at the army's hands that day took place elsewhere in Hebron during ensuing street clashes between soldiers and enraged local youths. Account by Witness</p>
        <p>But on a narrow street near the patriarchs' cave, known to Muslims as the Ibrahimi Mosque, Zlekha Muhtaseb said that as she prayed that morning in a section reserved for women, she heard what sounded like an exploding grenade and she then saw soldiers shooting at worshiping men and boys.</p>
        <p>"I came to the door to see what happened," said Mrs. Muhtaseb, a school teacher. "But the soldiers closed the door as I tried to look."</p>
        <p>She said that she was prepared to testify before the Shamgar group, which is focused for now on the accounts of the army but is supposed to turn to Palestinian witnesses next week, after a holiday ending the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. It is far from clear how many Arabs here will cooperate with the Israeli inquiry, which has been matched by two separate Palestinian investigations that are still in preliminary stages.</p>
        <p>In testimony on Tuesday, General Yatom said that for various reasons, including a late wake-up call for three border policemen, only one soldier was at his post of the six men who were supposed to be outside the Isaac Hall when Dr. Goldstein showed up. Also, television cameras and monitors in the cave were not all functioning properly.  General Changes Position</p>
        <p>Had there not been this breakdown in normal security arrangements, he testified, the mass killing could have been prevented -- a position contrary to one that the general had taken two days after the massacre. Then, he said at a news conference that, even if all the assigned men were in their proper places, "it would have been almost impossible to block any intention of a lunatic" on a suicide mission.</p>
        <p>General Yatom also told the panel members that there had been no intelligence warnings about possible Jewish terrorism, even though emotions were running high in recent months among Israeli settlers across the occupied territories and even though Hebron is a perennial flashpoint between Jews and Arabs. He acknowledged that the army had concentrated solely on possible terrorist acts by Palestinians against Israelis, not the other way around.</p>
        <p>In their questions on Tuesday, the commission members -- three judges, a former army chief of staff and a university president -- dwelt heavily on basic Israeli policies in the territories, suggesting that there could be political fallout when they announce their findings. Several of them, including the sole Israeli Arab, were especially troubled by a longstanding policy of allowing Jewish settlers to bring weapons into the patriarchs' cave.</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>U.S. to Back Resolution</p>
        <p>UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Special to The New York Times) -- The United States will support a Security Council resolution condemning the Hebron massacre, but will abstain from voting on a paragraph in the draft resolution that includes Jerusalem in the Israeli-occupied territories, diplomats here said today.</p>
        <p>"The United States doesn't want to veto the resolution in its entirety," one Western diplomat said, "because it doesn't want to keep the P.L.O. from the bargaining table."</p>
        <p>A Security Council resolution was proposed the day after the attack took place and was expected to gain early approval. It is still being debated principally because the United States and Israeli are opposed to language in the draft resolution that would, they say, agree to several P.L.O. demands that should be dealt with in the peace talks.</p>
        <p>The draft resolution accedes to a P.L.O. demand for the inclusion of the Jerusalem in the occupied territories.</p>
