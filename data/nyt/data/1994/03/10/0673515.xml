        <p>The Kellogg Company, the nation's largest maker of breakfast cereal, said yesterday that it had agreed to produce a new line under the Healthy Choice brand name in a licensing deal with Conagra Inc.</p>
        <p>The arrangement is a first for both companies. Kellogg has never licensed a cereal brand from another company, nor has Conagra let another company use its Healthy Choice name. Financial terms of the joint venture were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>"It's very unusual," said Lawrence Adelman, a food analyst for Dean Witter. The alliance creates some potential economic advantages for both companies, but whether it pays off with consumers will take longer to determine, he said.</p>
        <p>Kellogg's shares, which had risen 87.5 cents Tuesday in anticipation of the announcement, fell $1 yesterday, to $48.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>"The hype was not justified," Mr. Adelman said.</p>
        <p>Conagra shares rose to $28, up 75 cents, also on the Big Board. Out of Space</p>
        <p>Conagra has 300 products under the Healthy Choice label, including soups, frozen dinners and ice cream, but only egg substitutes in the breakfast area. The brand line, which was started six years ago, accounted for $1 billion of Conagra's $21 billion in sales last year. But the company, which is based in Omaha, does not have the manufacturing capacity for all its Healthy Choice products, many of which are made in plants of private-label producers.</p>
        <p>The alliance with Kellogg gives Conagra a relatively inexpensive means to broaden its product line. "The cereal business is very capital-intensive from a start-up basis," Mr. Adelman said.</p>
        <p>Kellogg has an opportunity to bolster its 37 percent share of the $8 billion cereal business by adding three varieties to the 45 brands it produces. "They will get a jump-start because of the brand name," Mr. Adelman said.</p>
        <p>Karen MacLeod, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, said, "This will bring the Healthy Choice consumer into the breakfast category."</p>
        <p>The cereal, which will have the green Healthy Choice packaging along with the red Kellogg name, will be available in June for $2.50 to $3.50 a box, in sizes ranging from 11.5 ounces to 16.5 ounces. It will come in three varieties: flakes, squares and multigrain clusters. Consumers gave the cereal high scores in taste tests, Ms. MacLeod said.</p>
        <p>The cereal is to be marketed to adults, who can already choose from shelves full of rival brands, like Nabisco Shredded Wheat, General Mills' Total and General Foods' Fruit &amp; Fiber.  COMPANY NEWS</p>
