        <p>As Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson lies critically ill in a hospital, his body weakened by strokes and seizures, the Lubavitch Hasidim keep a sidewalk vigil, waiting and praying through teardrops and raindrops. Many thoughts rush through their minds when they contemplate the physical trials of the 91-year-old man they all call Rebbe and many call Messiah, but one thought remains unspoken, if not unthinkable: death.</p>
        <p>"It's not something we're even prepared to contemplate," said Rabbi Yisrael Deren, the regional director for Chabad Lubavitch in western and southern New England. "What if the sun doesn't rise tomorrow morning? Our assumption is the Rebbe is going to get well."</p>

        <p>As Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson lies critically ill in a hospital, his body weakened by strokes and seizures, the Lubavitch Hasidim keep a sidewalk vigil, waiting and praying through teardrops and raindrops. Many thoughts rush through their minds when they contemplate the physical trials of the 91-year-old man they all call Rebbe and many call Messiah, but one thought remains unspoken, if not unthinkable: death.</p>
        <p>"It's not something we're even prepared to contemplate," said Rabbi Yisrael Deren, the regional director for Chabad Lubavitch in western and southern New England. "What if the sun doesn't rise tomorrow morning? Our assumption is the Rebbe is going to get well."</p>
        <p>The nearly 200,000 members of this mystical, proselytizing ultra-Orthodox Jewish group, which began in Russia and was transplanted to the United States in the 1940's, see themselves as having a special, individual relationship with their Rebbe. It was he who built them into a worldwide presence, sending emissaries from the Brooklyn headquarters to run schools, social-service centers and synagogues, and it was he who exhorted them to pray and work for the coming of the Messiah. Divisions Have Become Evident</p>
        <p>But the man who is the group's unifying force was stricken with a debilitating stroke in 1992. Since then a factionalism has become evident -- in arguments over his medical care, the group's direction, the handling of the aftermath of racial disturbances in Crown Heights and even the question of whether Rabbi Schneerson himself is the Messiah. Outside scholars and members of mainstream Jewish groups say these events arise from the anomaly of being a Hasidic group essentially without a Rebbe for two years.</p>
        <p>Leaders will not even talk about the issue of succession, even though the Rebbe has no children and no heir apparent.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Deren admits there have been some differences, but likens them to squabbles among sons in a family, albeit one under tremendous pressure. "We are a family in stress, and during a period of stress you get a situation where differences are exaggerated and blown way out of proportion," Rabbi Deren said. "I think one should not underestimate how unified the Lubavitch movement is and the effect the Rebbe continues to have not just on the Lubavitch movement, but on Jewry and the world as a whole."</p>
        <p>Samuel Heilman, a professor of sociology and Jewish studies at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said the absence of leadership has brought into the open tensions between Lubavitchers who prefer a more insular existence and those involved with chabad, or outreach work on a broader scale.</p>
        <p>"Now that the center is so tragically empty for them, they are trying to fill the vacuum," said Mr. Heilman, the author of "Defenders of the Faith," a study of Orthodox Judaism. "Much of what is going on is trying to jockey for what goes on afterward. Will the Chabad side win or the Lubavitch side win?" 'Tug of War' Between Aides</p>
        <p>He said a "tug of war" existed between Rabbi Leib Groner, a secretary to the Rebbe who long controlled access to him, and Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky, another secretary and a spokesman for the Lubavitch worldwide movement. Rabbi Groner has been compared to being a chief of staff, a gatekeeper who guards the Rebbe, while Rabbi Krinsky was seen as being more like a foreign minister, the public representative who conveyed the official line. Both men were involved in dealing with the Rebbe's medical emergency and could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>A doctor who has been a member of the medical team treating the Rebbe, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two aides had differed at times over how best to treat the Rebbe, especially in his period of convalescence after the first stroke in 1992.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Groner originally took on the duties of dealing with the Rebbe's health, but his actions were criticized by others, including Rabbi Krinsky, when they thought he was shielding the Rebbe and not pursuing sufficiently aggressive treatments. Some of these differences spilled out into public, compounded by speculation among those who did not have direct knowledge of the Rebbe's condition or treatment.</p>
        <p>But the doctor added that while the rabbis close to the Rebbe may have differed, they did so without malice. "In defense of all of them, each one of these men has in his heart good intentions for the Rebbe and tries what is best to do what is right," he said. "But these are people who are strong-minded. Often they see things only one way, and it leads to difficult situations and being slow to forgive one another."</p>
        <p>Among the Hasidim, rumors and arguments over the Rebbe's medical care have spilled into the open. Part of the problem over the last two years, the doctor said, was that Lubavitch officials never really indicated the seriousness of the Rebbe's condition, from the time when the first stroke was optimistically characterized as mild when it was in fact extensive. But such terms fueled hope that there would be a quick recovery.</p>
        <p>"Nobody ever really gave an honest appraisal," he said. "The information has never been as forthright as it could be." Possible Power Struggle</p>
        <p>Mr. Heilman saw the differences over the Rebbe's care extending into another area, however, involving a struggle for power between Rabbis Groner and Krinsky, who jockey to remain in charge.</p>
        <p>"The fallacy is they never realized that their power can't last any longer than the Rebbe's power lasts," he said. "What they always fail to realize is that a new Rebbe will bring in his new cabinet."</p>
        <p>While no one is talking about succession, Mr. Heilman said it would eventually be handled by a committee that would seek someone who had proved to be a superior scholar and teacher and can lay claim to an ability to communicate with his predecessor. He said it was not an irreversible decision, and the successor would have to win over people.</p>
        <p>Some Lubavitchers said there was a split of sorts between those who are more parochially oriented around the group's headquarters in Crown Heights and those who eagerly go beyond the city in their outreach. For Rabbi Manis Friedman, the dean of a women's seminar in St. Paul, Minn., both tendencies can and should coexist.</p>
        <p>"We would both benefit from bringing a little of the cosmopolitan into the community and to bring some of the cohesiveness of the community into the activities of the outreach world," he said. "You've got to keep the home fires hot while traveling around the world." Talk of a Messianic Era</p>
        <p>But the period of the Rebbe's illness has also coincided with intensified pronouncements of the impending arrival of the messianic era, with many believing that the Rebbe will reveal himself to be the Messiah, or Moshiach. Last year a number of his supporters even held a prayer meeting hoping for such an event.</p>
        <p>"That feeds this phenomenon of being forsaken and needing a messiah to uplift them," said one Orthodox rabbi.</p>
        <p>Even while many Lubavitchers believe the Rebbe is the Messiah, there was worry among some that it would lead to a misunderstanding by the outside world.</p>
        <p>"What happened with the Rebbe's illness was there were some who made the tragic error that times had changed and the time had come to bring that message to the world," Rabbi Deren said. "The only message to the world was that we were heading off the deep end."</p>
        <p>Rabbi Shmuel Butman, the chairman of the International Campaign to Bring Moshiach, said his group's only message was that the messianic era was imminent and that the world should prepare to receive him. And while he personally believes the Rebbe to be the Messiah, he insisted that it was a separate issue from the campaign, even if some people confused the two.</p>
        <p>Leaders of mainstream Jewish organizations said they perceived a leadership vacuum that complicated matters, especially in the wake of the racial disturbances in Crown Heights in 1991, in which a Hasidic scholar was attacked by a mob of black youths and killed.</p>
        <p>"A more vibrant Rebbe I think could have made a difference in arriving at a more peaceful conclusion to the tensions between blacks and Jews," said the head of one group, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "I just think that now you have a rudderless ship. And not only is there no rudder, there's no captain."</p>
        <p>Another leader, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, noted that those Hasidim who participated in the Crown Heights Coalition, an interracial group that sought to ease the tensions and make recommendations after the violence, were not fully supported in the neighborhood. Whereas the traditional view held that there was a value to such alliances, the message coming from Crown Heights was that it was permissible to be insular.</p>
        <p>"That attitude has been costly for the whole Jewish community," this leader said. "It wasn't seen to be in the vested interest of the community to bridge issues and appear to care about the well-being of another community as it cared for itself."</p>
        <p>Rabbi Shea Hecht, the coalition's chairman, acknowledged that he could have received more support, especially since some of his fellow Hasidim accused him of "selling out." But he said that his superiors always knew what he was doing.</p>
        <p>"I felt that I was serving my community and making progress, but also had a tremendous amount of praise that the little dent I was doing has filtered down, and now the black community is not so against us," he said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, some mainstream Jewish leaders credited the Lubavitch group with having promoted Judaism, especially in parts of the world where they were often the only Jewish presence.</p>
        <p>Members of the movement acknowledge that while it has been difficult not being able to communicate directly with the Rebbe, it has not diminished their faith. In some ways, Rabbi Deren said, it seemed as if the Rebbe's discourses and exhortations of the past four decades had been preparing them all along for the travails of the last two years.</p>
        <p>"At a certain level the connection between Hasids and the Rebbe today is at a deeper stage," Rabbi Deren said. "When I am in the streets of Stamford, whether it's a question of giving a child a Jewish education or reaching out to a couple, I know at that point I cannot be any closer to the Rebbe than when I know I'm doing things I know he wants me to do."</p>
        <p>And of course, there is the firm belief that the Rebbe will recover, providing once again a single voice for the group.</p>
        <p>"As soon as the Rebbe gets better," said Rabbi Friedman, "the differences of opinion will disappear into the woodwork."</p>
