        <p>Woodbury Ski Area</p>
        <p>Route 47  Woodbury, Conn.  (203) 263-2203; (203) 263-2213  Recommended ages: 4 and up</p>
        <p>The drive from New York City to Woodbury in Litchfield County lands you in the heart of a New England town with a definite aura. The road to the resort is lined with well-kept 18th- and 19th-century houses along with Connecticut's oldest inn, Heritage Inn, in Southbury; one expects to overtake Paul Revere cantering by. Coupled with an overnight layer of snow on old drifts, the scene is as picturesque and unreal -- especially to Manhattanites -- as one from a travel magazine.</p>

        <p>Woodbury Ski Area</p>
        <p>Route 47  Woodbury, Conn.  (203) 263-2203; (203) 263-2213  Recommended ages: 4 and up</p>
        <p>The drive from New York City to Woodbury in Litchfield County lands you in the heart of a New England town with a definite aura. The road to the resort is lined with well-kept 18th- and 19th-century houses along with Connecticut's oldest inn, Heritage Inn, in Southbury; one expects to overtake Paul Revere cantering by. Coupled with an overnight layer of snow on old drifts, the scene is as picturesque and unreal -- especially to Manhattanites -- as one from a travel magazine.</p>
        <p>The 23-year-old resort is casual and tiny and proud of it. Woodbury, owned by Rod Taylor, a former member of the United States Olympic ski team, is the state's smallest ski resort and the one closest to New York City: about 95 miles (two hours from lower Manhattan). Last Saturday, with gusty winds, it was nicely uncrowded. There is a slalom course and snow-board trail and downhill skiing on novice, intermediate or expert hills.  (The expert hills, reached by a chairlift with a bar, are short.) You can also cross-country ski.</p>
        <p>My 5-year-old son, ignited by Olympic fires under his rented skis and boots (no poles), snow plowed on the bunny -- or children's -- slope, which has a rope tow. He started with a group lesson ($15), but after five minutes, it was clear that the disorganized class, with its wide age range, was making my son miserable. His afternoon sailed smoothly once my husband, on skis himself, helped out. In fact, many parents ran alongside their children on the rope tow, disregarding formal lessons.</p>
        <p>The rustic lodge has a wood-burning stove. The place is so laid-back that a golden retriever wanders around nuzzling the guests. At one point, the counterman yelled to a customer, "Your coffee is ready!" and the customer called back, "I'll be there in a minute!" Too bad the staff ignored the lodge's overflowing garbage can and dirty rugs. But Woodbury has virtues: an approachable size, friendliness and a country setting.</p>
        <p>Ski rentals are $20. Weekday and weekend downhill lift tickets are $20 for adults and $17 for children 12 and under (weekdays 10:30 A.M. to 6 P.M.; Saturdays and Sundays, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.). Half-day tickets (weekdays 1 to 6 P.M.; weekends, 1 to 5 P.M.) are $17, or $15 for children. A sledding pass is $10. There are also night skiing and first-time skiier specials. Cross-country rentals are $15; trail passes, $10. The resort is open weekdays from 10 A.M. to 10 P.M. and weekends from 9 A.M. to 10 P.M. Take 684 North to 84 East, exit 15. Follow the signs to Woodbury, where there is a sign that says "ski area."  'Monkey Business II'</p>
        <p>Emily Dickinson Theater  Public School 75  735 West End Avenue (at 95th Street)  Manhattan  (212) 666-1716</p>
        <p>Recommended ages: 4 to 10  Through March 13</p>
        <p>The monkey returns, as the subtitle, "The Continuing Adventures of Wu-Kong, the Monkey King," implies. In this play, the impish Wu-Kong, a Buddhist priest and a slobbering pig (which has the most hilarious costume and lines) discover that women are not wimps. The priest and the pig undergo consciousness-raising by miraculously becoming pregnant, which the young audience finds thrilling.</p>
        <p>The 45-minute program is enlivened by Chinese music, a martial-arts scene, shiny costumes and humor (a tad cliched when it comes to the discomforts of pregnancy). If only the On Stage Productions company could omit the preachy monologue at the end to convey its social messages. Tickets are $8 for adults and $6 for children; call for reservations or buy at the door. Performances are Saturdays and Sundays at 3 P.M. Maple Sugaring</p>
        <p>Stamford Museum and Nature Center  39 Scofieldtown Road  Stamford, Conn.  (203) 322-1646  Recommended for all ages  Sunday</p>
        <p>There are actually children who prefer fake maple syrup to the real thing. Can you imagine? (The consolation is that the pretend stuff is usually cheaper.) At this indoor-outdoor demonstration, children can watch as staff members prepare the sap using three methods: American Indian, Colonial and modern-day evaporator. Then you can buy maple syrup and also taste brownies and doughnuts with syrup on them.</p>
        <p>Admission is $4 for adults; $3 for children 5 to 14, and free for those under 5. The demonstrations will be held from 11 A.M. to 4 P.M. Take the Merritt Parkway to Exit 35, the junction of High Ridge and Scofieldtown Roads.</p>
