        <p>Five years ago this month about 50 Arab and Israeli intellectuals and diplomats met near a lake in Switzerland to pretend that their nations and peoples were at peace.</p>
        <p>What would they do with that peace? How could they join to enrich the economy and cultures of the Middle East? How could they best work together after decades of war and rage?</p>
        <p>Most of the Arabs and Israelis at the Lausanne meeting could not leap across the table, let alone their war.  The Israelis talked a lot about great technological and scientific cooperation to put deserts into joint bloom.</p>
        <p>Arabs said we do not want to be patted on the head like needy natives. We want to make our own deserts bloom with our own technology. One reason we want peace is to get away from Israelis, not to make love in some garden of their fantasies.</p>
        <p>In Israel the other day, presidents of American Jewish organizations met with Palestinian representatives. I was told that the message was pretty much the same -- peace if possible, but the peace of divorce.</p>
        <p>I have heard the contrast in tone and emotion before Lausanne and since. Often in New York I have listened to Jewish after-dinner speakers talk of the new Mideast that Israelis and Arabs could create hand in hand. Once I asked a speaker, an Israeli Labor Party politician, to name a few Arab leaders who were making that speech to their people. He smiled but I think he thought I was just being rude.</p>
        <p>Now, though, it seems to me, more Israelis are thinking that the best idea might be a swift, permanent divorce, terms to be fought over in negotiation and settled in advance, instead of the years of dangerous wrangling toward murky goals that the "peace process" calls for.</p>
        <p>That thought began to root deeper even before the hideousness of the mass murder at the mosque. Jews and maverick Palestinians were being picked off one by one by one by people who one day would be responsible for both Jewish and Palestinian safety on the West Bank.</p>
        <p>That does not seem a very peaceful process -- particularly since neither Jew nor Arab knows how the negotiations are expected to end. It is supposed to be a matter of faith that one year they will end well. How much warmth is that meanwhile to mourners at cold gravesides?</p>
        <p>Most serious negotiations have an understood goal -- a labor contract, a divorce settlement, a treaty. The job is to use negotiations to build bridges to reach the goal, not to figure out where those bridges might conceivably lead. That thought was put in my head by Kenneth Bialkin, the New York lawyer who has given many years of leadership to American Jewish organizations, after he took part in the conversations with the Palestinians this week.</p>
        <p>But the Israeli-P.L.O. scheme worked out at Oslo leaves open what is supposed to happen when it is all over five years, at least, from now.</p>
        <p>Independent Palestine? Autonomous Palestine? Partitioned, confederated, federated Palestine? What?</p>
        <p>The uncertainty is fundamentally fiction. The Palestinians know what they want all right: independence. The Israeli Government does not say exactly what it has in mind. To be specific would have driven away either the P.L.O. or the Israeli public.</p>
        <p>So for its own good reason Israel insists the end is a question it cannot talk about for a few years. Meanwhile it gives Palestinians conditions that would logically end in Palestinian independence -- or war if not.</p>
        <p>Israel has promised Palestinians swift control over Jericho and Gaza, withdrawal of Israeli forces from much of the West Bank, a Palestinian police force responsible for internal security. That amounts to the dish of independence. Does anybody really expect Palestinians then to say, how delicious but of course without permission I will not eat?</p>
        <p>Some Labor leaders are prepared to accept Palestinian independence. Those who are not worry not so much about residents of the West Bank but those millions of scattered Palestinians who would demand to return.</p>
        <p>Labor says the negotiations will bring a decent peace. The Likud opposition says they will more likely bring war. Either way, calling Israelis from New York before I arrived, I heard nothing about desert gardens. Maybe it is better to forget them until another day, another century.</p>
