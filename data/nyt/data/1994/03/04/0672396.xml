        <p>Chuck Hoberman</p>
        <p>Museum of Modern Art  11 West 53d Street  Manhattan  Through April 12</p>
        <p>Few works in art museums come with patents, but Chuck Hoberman's "Iris Dome," the subject of the latest installment in the Museum of Modern Art's Projects series, is an exception. Trained as both a sculptor and a mechanical engineer, Mr. Hoberman prefers to be called an inventor; in the "Iris Dome" he has developed an unusual form of retractable dome for stadiums.</p>
        <p>The dome consists of a network of interlocking and swiveling metal units, arranged in spiraling lines like the heart of a sunflower and carrying overlapping protective plates. As the dome expands and contracts like the iris of an eye, the plates lock into position, covering the stadium.</p>
        <p>Included here are a scale model of a domed stadium, a view from inside a computer-generated image of a dome and various blueprints related to its construction. But the centerpiece of the show is a working section of a dome to cover an area 60 feet in diameter; both the dome on the scale model and the larger working section expand and contract periodically.</p>
        <p>Few viewers are likely to be able to assess the design's structural soundness or its advantages over competing approaches. But the shape of the dome is elegant, and its structure has the convincing simplicity of organic forms CHARLES HAGEN</p>
