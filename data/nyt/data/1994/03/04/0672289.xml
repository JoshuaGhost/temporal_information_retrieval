        <p>A senior Palestinian official sent here to discuss conditions for resuming peace talks had encouraging words today, saying an agreement with Israel was the best way to ensure security for Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Nabil Shaath, the envoy from the Palestine Liberation Organization, told reporters tonight, "We want the peace process to continue and succeed because this is the only guarantee that we will have real security in the long run."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shaath suggested that some measures were needed to restart the talks after a militant Israeli settler massacred Palestinians at a mosque in the West Bank last Friday. Seeking International Force</p>
        <p>American officials said Mr. Shaath told the United States that the P.L.O.  wanted Israel to take further steps to disarm settlers and to protect Palestinians before the P.L.O. would return to the negotiating table.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaath also asked for assistance in pressing the Israelis to accept an international force to maintain peace in the occupied territories, United States officials said.</p>
        <p>"I think there is a lot that needs to be done and can be done," he said. "That's why I am here."</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaath said the purpose of his trip was "to accomplish measures that would enhance the security of the Palestinian people after this grisly massacre at Hebron, that will enable us to continue this peace process."</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaath met tonight with Dennis Ross, the senior American official involved in the Middle East negotiations, and Robert H. Pelletreau Jr., the Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. On Friday morning, he is scheduled to meet with Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said Mr. Shaath had a specific demand for the United States: that it bar Americans from contributing money to militant Israeli settlers. One official said that in response, the State Department had asked the Justice Department to examine whether the Administration could ban such contributions.</p>
        <p>The official said the Administration would examine, for example, whether it would violate the First Amendment to ban donations to militant groups that want to remove Arabs from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>In coming to the United States, Mr. Shaath clearly hopes to broadcast the P.L.O.'s message that not enough is being done to protect the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>"The peace process was rudely interrupted with the crime," he said. "We discovered we really have to protect Palestinians from settlers and not just the other way around."</p>
        <p>After the Hebron massacre, President Clinton invited the Palestinians and Israelis to resume their talks in Washington, confident that the United States could push the two sides to reach an agreement. Israel immediately accepted the invitation, but many Palestinians have pressed the P.L.O.'s chairman, Yasir Arafat, not to participate unless certain conditions are met.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaath's visit "is an indication of their desire to do things that will result in the negotations restarting," a senior Administration official.  WEST BANK MASSACRE</p>
