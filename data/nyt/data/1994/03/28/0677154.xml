        <p>Millions of Ukrainians voted today in their first free parliamentary elections as an independent country.</p>
        <p>Turnout was generally high, but in Crimea, where ethnic Russians are more than 70 percent of the population, the number of valid ballots could end up below the 50 percent of registered voters required.</p>
        <p>The secessionist president of the peninsula, Yuri Meshkov, called for a boycott, asking Crimean residents to vote instead on a non-binding poll of their views toward dual Russian-Ukrainian citizenship, equal status of Crimea with Kiev (a euphemism for independence) and more power for himself.</p>
        <p>In a symbolically important move, the pro-Russian leadership of Crimea ordered clocks put forward two hours this morning for summer time, rather than one hour, to put the peninsula on Moscow time.</p>
        <p>Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, independent Ukraine has been paralyzed by squabbles among the former Soviet elite that largely retained power here. The economy, almost entirely unchanged, has been drowning in inflation, which has devalued the Ukrainian currency from parity with the Russian ruble two years ago to 22 to 1 today.</p>
        <p>The economic distress, worsened by a large share of inefficient Soviet industry, has created a strong nostalgia for re-association with Russia, especially among ethnic Russians in Crimea and industrial, coal-mining eastern Ukraine. In areas of eastern Ukraine, voters were also asked if they favor a federal Ukraine with closer economic ties to Russia and the use of Russian as an official language.</p>
        <p>The elections are an effort to break the political stalemate and create a new, post-independence parliament to replace one elected in March 1990. But the old deputies wrote stiff rules, requiring a 50 percent turnout in each constituency, while making it easy for candidates to register.</p>
        <p>One result is that there were nearly 6,000 candidates, an average of 13 in each district, confusing voters. Only 11 percent of the candidates are affiliated with any party.</p>
        <p>Results of today's voting are not expected before Monday, and second-round runoffs on April 10 seem inevitable in most districts.</p>
        <p>In Kiev's 11th district, where there were 28 candidates, Andrei V. Koshkin, a young teacher, and his wife, Valentina, were voting but were doubtful that 50 percent of the electorate would come out again.</p>
        <p>"We've stopped believing in the promises of any politician," Mrs. Koshkin said. "Now we only believe in ourselves."</p>
        <p>For the election to be valid, at least 301 seats of the 450 in the legislature must be filled. If not enough voters turn out to fill these seats in valid elections, that is, with 50 percent of the registered voters actually voting, the old Parliament will remain in office until March 1995.</p>
