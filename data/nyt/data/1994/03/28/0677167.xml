        <p>Italians began voting today in a two-day national election widely depicted by politicians and commentators as a watershed between the old and the new -- indeed, as the dawning of a new republic. As she voted in Rome this morning, Luciana Vagnetti was not so sure.</p>

        <p>Italians began voting today in a two-day national election widely depicted by politicians and commentators as a watershed between the old and the new -- indeed, as the dawning of a new republic. As she voted in Rome this morning, Luciana Vagnetti was not so sure.</p>
        <p>"There is a saying that in Italy, everything should change so that nothing will change," the historical researcher said, citing the most-quoted aphorism from "The Leopard," a 1958 novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa.</p>
        <p>If that kind of skepticism suffused the voting today, so too did a sense that having chased away their corrupt but predictable political old guard, Italians are not quite sure what exactly they have let themselves in for in its place.</p>
        <p>"For the first time, I don't know in advance what the result will be," said Maria Antonietta Destro, a high school teacher and a leftist. She evoked Italy's collective memory of elections that regular as clockwork since 1948, have produced 52 Christian Democrat-led coalitions and 52 oppositions led by the Communists and their spiritual heirs. Christian Democrats Sink</p>
        <p>This time, though, the Christian Democrats are not even on the ballot.  Their name has changed to the Popular Party, their support has crashed because of the country's corruption scandal, and voters are facing a novel choice between fragile new alliances that could put former Communists or right-wing insurgents in power for the first time.</p>
        <p>"It will be enough for me just to get rid of the old system that robbed us for all that time," Sergio Caporilli, an office-cleaner, said after he voted in the Roma Uno district in the center of the city. He chose the leftist candidate for the lower house from the district, Luigi Spaventa, over Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate who has catapulted himself in a few months to become the leading standard-bearer of the right.</p>
        <p>Nationally, Mr. Berlusconi is in alliance with the neo-Fascist leader Gianfranco Fini and the northern separatist Umberto Bossi. On the left, the former Communist leader, Achille Occhetto, leads an alliance called the Progressives, while a third and smaller centrist grouping has formed from among former Christian Democrats.</p>
        <p>Some 48 million Italians over age 18 are eligible to vote today and Monday for the 630 seats in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, while 41 milion over age 25 are eligible to vote for the 315 upper house seats in the Senate. A New Electoral System</p>
        <p>They were voting under new, unwieldy and untested laws that apportion three-quarters of the seats according to an American-style majority system and the remaining one-quarter under Italy's traditional proportional representation by party.</p>
        <p>The national election -- usually held every five years -- is being held early, less than two years after the last one. And it is viewed as the most important since the Christian Democrats took power in 1948, backed by the United States and the Roman Catholic Church, to begin a crusade against Communism that gradually became the cover for widespread corruption.</p>
        <p>The headlines in today's papers did not miss the epochal nature of things. "Ciao, ciao, First Republic," said L'Indipendente. "The Second Republic," declared La Repubblica. "Italy -- revolution by ballot," said Il Messaggero.</p>
        <p>Beyond the hoopla, though, there seemed more doubt than conviction that some kind of new and well-governed -- if not squeaky-clean -- Italy was about to be born. "The Italy of 1994 that is going to the polls today seems to have lost all point of reference," said Ezio Mauro, a columnist in La Stampa.</p>
        <p>The country's new electoral system, he said, "is not able to guarantee the equilibrium needed to govern a complex society." And with the demise of the Christian Democrats, Italy has lost "the capability to transform the right-wing instinct into something diverse and unique -- Italian moderation."</p>
        <p>The comment reflected a sense that for all the talk of revolution and a second republic, Italy's transformation is incomplete. Speed Is Doubted</p>
        <p>"You cannot destroy the traditions of a people in a few seconds," said another voter in Roma Uno, Umberto Gamino, an engineer. "You cannot destroy a religion just like that. Today in Italy, that is what we have tried to do."</p>
        <p>The likely outcome of the two-day vote, extended to permit Jewish voters to cast their ballots after Passover, is far from clear.</p>
        <p>The last opinion surveys more than two weeks ago gave Mr. Berlusconi's right-wing alliance a slight edge over Mr. Occhetto's leftists, but suggested that no one would emerge with a clear majority. That means that the country, far from breaking new ground, could find itself in the familiar and protracted holding pattern of coalition-building among its new leaders.</p>
        <p>And since opinion polls were last published, the electoral campaign has turned into bitter and divisive mudslinging between Mr. Occhetto and Mr. Berlusconi that seemed to produce little advantage for either of them, possibly strengthening the centrists as potential king-makers.</p>
        <p>"Will anything change?" said the Rev. Domenico Chianella, a Jesuit who voted in Roma Uno. "This is known only to God. Let's hope. But only God knows."</p>
