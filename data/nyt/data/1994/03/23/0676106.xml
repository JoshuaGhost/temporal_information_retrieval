        <p>After months of testy negotiations, the International Monetary Fund agreed tonight to provide Russia with a crucial $1.5 billion loan in exchange for a promise of new taxes and strict curbs on Government spending.</p>
        <p>The agreement, signed by Michel Camdessus, managing director of the I.M.F., and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, is essential to further economic support from Western governments and private businesses. Mr. Chernomyrdin has moved to impress foreign bankers as being much more willing to carry out tough economic measures.</p>
        <p>The agreement is also a desperately needed vote of confidence for the Government in carrying out economic reforms. Without the loan, foreign investment, which is already slowing considerably, could have come to a halt. Russia already owes foreign creditors more than $80 billion. What Moscow Must Do</p>
        <p>With today's signing, Moscow can apply for an additional $4 billion loan from the I.M.F. and seek financial support from the World Bank.</p>
        <p>"It is true that in the I.M.F., we owe the truth to the international community," Mr. Camdessus said tonight at a news conference. "And so we put our friends, the countries working with us, to a severe test."</p>
        <p>But there are serious conditions: Mr. Chernomyrdin said that by April 15, he would draft measures to raise more Government revenue, including new taxes and a far more rigorous effort to collect current taxes. Additional budget cuts are also possible, he said.</p>
        <p>The International Monetary Fund has already lent Russia $2.5 billion since 1992, only a small fraction of the aid promised by the West. Most aid was contingent on austerity moves to reduce Russia's budget deficit and the inflation rate, moves that Moscow has not yet carried out. Overcoming Skepticism</p>
        <p>Prices rose tenfold last year, and deficit projections for this year are optimistic. Thus it was unclear even early this evening whether the I.M.F. would approve the $1.5 billion loan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Camdessus and his colleagues have expressed skepticism over the budget figures sent to Parliament this week by Mr. Chernomyrdin, who estimated a deficit of $36 billion, or 9 percent of the gross domestic product.</p>
        <p>But the Government reported a sharp drop in the inflation rate this month, to 9.9 percent, the lowest figure in more than a year.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Chernomyrdin's attempts at reform have won praise, even from the former Finance Minister, Boris Fyodorov, whose departure in January was seen as a severe setback to free-market economic policies. At that time, many experts predicted that Mr. Chernomyrdin would continue pumping credits and subsidies into the economy, keeping inflation high.</p>
        <p>But many serious obstacles to significant economic improvement remain. Industrial production has fallen shaprly -- almost 25 percent since the start of the year -- and the Government continues to support dozens of bloated industries. Tax revenues have not nearly kept pace with spending.</p>
        <p>In addition, Moscow's spending projections may be unrealistically low. This week Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev warned that his $105 billion budget would not cover half the cost of maintaining even diminished forces.</p>
        <p>All this has left the I.M.F. and other economists deeply concerned about the long-term prospects for economic reform. But the fund itself has also been criticized for its seemingly tentative support of reform efforts.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Chernomyrdin faces his own political problems: in December, hard-liners triumphed in elections at least in part because they opposed the economic reforms that agencies like the fund have demanded. Chernomyrdin Is Upbeat</p>
        <p>Mr. Camdessus promised that he would move forward with the new loan as soon as he is convinced that Russia is doing all it can to control inflation and reduce budget deficits.</p>
        <p>"I must say outright that there is work ahead on this document," Mr. Chernomyrdin said tonight. "We have assumed an obligation to the I.M.F. experts, and we will draft our package of measures by April 15."</p>
        <p>A senior Clinton Administration official, alluding to Mr. Chernomyrdin's political opponents, said today: "The agreement is essential for several reasons. Of course it represents an official I.M.F. endorsement of the policies that Russia is now following. But it is also meant to lead to further investment. And that should help the reformers."</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin said the Government would not artificially support the ruble, whose value has fallen by nearly half since the end of 1993. Today the rate was 1,750 rubles for a dollar.</p>
