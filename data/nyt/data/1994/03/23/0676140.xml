        <p>An experimental cancer treatment that recruits the immune system to destroy malignant cells has been shown to help a small percentage of patients, according to a study being published today.</p>
        <p>But experts cautioned that the rate of response was very low and that the treatment was very toxic. Many of those who were not helped suffered severe side effects, and some died.</p>
        <p>The study, by Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg and his colleagues at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., is a long-term follow-up of 283 patients who had the skin cancer melanoma or kidney cancer that had spread and who were no longer helped by conventional treatments.</p>
        <p>Reporting in today's Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Rosenberg said that when they gave the patients an immune system stimulator, interleukin 2, 7 percent were apparently cured. An additional 10 percent of the melanoma patients and an additional 13 percent of the kidney cancer patients had partial responses, meaning that their tumors shrank temporarily.</p>
        <p>The idea of the treatment is to attack cancer indirectly by giving patients interleukin 2, which can stimulate white blood cells to kill the invading cancer cells. Interleukin 2 by itself has no effect on cancer cells, so in this respect it is very different from other cancer therapies, like chemotherapy or radiation, that are directed against malignant cells. "You can bathe cancer cells in interleukin 2 and you get no response," Dr. Rosenberg said. "All the impact is through the immune system."</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenberg said in a telephone interview that he believed that the treatment had proved itself, but that more research and modifications were necessary.</p>
        <p>"I think this treatment as it stands can be a significant help to a small population of patients who have metastatic kidney cancer or melanoma," Dr. Rosenberg said.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, the findings "represent a proof of the principle that you can get enduring complete regression with strictly an immunological maneuver." "Not the Panacea"</p>
        <p>In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Samuel Hellman, a cancer researcher at the University of Chicago, cautioned that interleukin 2 was "not the panacea for which we have hoped." He added, however, that the treatment responses were "better than described with any other regimen" and that the results, although limited, showed that immune system therapy could work.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jeffrey Bluestone, an immunologist at the University of Chicago, said, "I think that just the idea that one can think about in the future using immunological therapy for cancer is a dramatic and important observation." But he added, "Even Steve would say that this is not the magic bullet."</p>
        <p>In his report on the treatment, Dr. Rosenberg noted the low response rate and side effects that can harm the heart, the kidneys, the liver and the nervous system. Three patients died after receiving interleukin 2.</p>
        <p>George Annas, an ethicist and health lawyer at Boston University, criticized the scope of the study, noting that only 10 patients who responded were followed for more than two years. "That's pretty weak," he said. The effectiveness of the treatment was questionable, he said, since a small percentage of patients with these cancers live for years after metastasis anyway and there are, rarely, spontaneous remissions.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Annas said, in Dr. Rosenberg's study, "more than 80 percent of the patients did not do any better and they actually did worse. They died harder." He added: "That's not irrelevant. We always tend to concentrate on the survivors, but we've got to make that point that more than 80 percent had terrific side effects and didn't get any measurable increase in longevity."</p>
        <p>Mr. Annas said he would have preferred a study in which patients were randomly assigned to receive interleukin 2 or no treatment, to see if those who were treated fared better as a group.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rosenberg said that such studies were "exceedingly difficult to do" because patients were reluctant to risk being in the group receiving no treatment. And, he said, "with patients with metastatic cancer, if you see the cancer going away, you know you've done something."</p>
        <p>And now, having shown that the treatment can work for some, Dr. Rosenberg said, "the goal is to improve it."</p>
