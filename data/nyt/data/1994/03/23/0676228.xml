        <p>Amid the abundant joy here today in celebration of just the second Sweet 16 appearance by a University of Florida basketball team in the program's 75 years, there is anger and some confusion.</p>
        <p>The Gators were allotted 1,000 tickets to the East regional commencing Friday at Miami Arena, 850 of which will go to alumni who have demonstrated their faithfulness (read: money) and the remainder to students.</p>
        <p>"A lot of people are mad," Norm Carlson, the university's assistant athletic director for communications, said today. "They don't understand the process. They think that tickets just went on sale, not that the place has long been sold out.</p>
        <p>"I guarantee you that if they had a 20,000-seat arena down there, we could more than fill it up with Gator fans."</p>
        <p>Still, a number of Florida loyalists will make the 330-mile trek to Miami. Finding a Way</p>
        <p>"People have told me they're gonna find a way to get in," said Dametri Hill, Florida's 6-foot-7-inch, 286-pound center. "I'm rooting for 'em."</p>
        <p>Certainly, the Gators' proximity to the regional appears to make their meeting Friday night against Connecticut the next best thing to a home game -- unlike last week, when they were roundly booed against Pennsylvania at Nassau Coliseum at Uniondale, L.I.</p>
        <p>"If we can give them something to get excited about, then they might really get involved," Florida Coach Lon Kruger said. "Of course, too, you have to consider Boston College fans and Indiana fans. They're going to be on our side because they don't want to play UConn, either."</p>
        <p>The Gators (27-7) could well be the most faceless group this year to make the Sweet 16. Most of the players look like crewcut clones of their coach. There is no National Basketball Association first-round draft choice among them. Nobody averages as high as 16 points a game. They preach team unity. There are no discipline problems.</p>
        <p>These guys don't even yield to the fashionable temptation of the day -- trash-talking their opponents.</p>
        <p>That is just the way the mild-mannered, organized, blend-into-a-crowd Kruger likes it. He says he believes you win with good people, an approach that served him well in four seasons at Kansas State. Before he got here four seasons ago, discipline was a foreign word in the program. No Valets on This Team</p>
        <p>One of his first moves was to make the players start carrying their own bags on road trips.</p>
        <p>"Obviously, there were some things that needed to be changed perception-wise, both internally and externally," Kruger said. "I think the key to that is just getting the type of people that are interested in being here, the type of people who are going to work hard on and off the basketball floor."</p>
        <p>Kruger still hasn't made many in-roads to the vast reservoir of Florida talent. One of his two Florida starters, 6-10 Andrew DeClercq, had doubts.</p>
        <p>"I had no intention of staying within the state until he took this job," said DeClercq, who added that he had associated the university with its National Collegiate Athletic Association football and basketball violations that punctuated the 1980's.  The Kids Grew Up</p>
        <p>This team long ago surpassed all expectations. Even earlier this season, after a fast start, Kruger had no reason to believe that his Gators would be among the final 16 teams.</p>
        <p>"It's like you go on vacation for a couple of weeks and come back to find the kids have grown up," he said. "Things have changed so much that all of a sudden we're sitting here talking, 'Well, we've got a chance to beat UConn, and then the next team might forfeit.' That's a big change in attitudes, big change of perceptions."</p>
        <p>On Friday, of course, Connecticut, with Donyell Marshall, could bring the Gators crashing back to reality.</p>
        <p>"Our primary objective going into the ball game is to handle their pressure, because if you don't do that, then I really don't think you have a chance to win," Kruger said. "And that is only step one among many steps. But it's the most crucial."</p>
        <p>He hasn't divulged his strategy for dealing with Marshall.</p>
        <p>"If you double on him you give up a lot elsewhere, and you make players around him even much better than what they are, and they're already pretty good," he said. "Otherwise, maybe you just play everyone straight up and recognize that Donyell is going to get his. I would imagine we'll mix that up a little bit.</p>
        <p>"We don't have the luxury of dictating the situation. We'll have to react a little bit." Team Find-a-Way</p>
        <p>Early this season, Kruger said his team appeared to "find a way to win." Eventually it caught on. Florida became Team Find-a-Way.</p>
        <p>"Not always have they shot the ball well or not always have they rebounded effectively," the coach said. "But they've really not been consistently poor in any one area.</p>
        <p>"Plus, they've developed a realization of what our strengths are and let's play to those, and let's not try to do things we can't do individually. That's the trademark of this team."  N.C.A.A. TOURNAMENT</p>
