        <p>YACHT RACING  Intrum Justitia in Lead  Intrum Justitia opened a lead of 31 nautical miles yesterday on the fourth leg of the Whitbread Round the World Race. The European Whitbread 60 Class yacht, skippered by Lawrie Smith of Britain, was reported 917 miles from the finish of the leg in Punta del Este, Uruguay. New Zealand Endeavor, the leading Maxiclass entry, was second and Tokio was in third place, 37 miles behind Endeavor, with Yamaha another three miles back. Most of the 14-yacht fleet have rounded Cape Horn, but some were struggling to continue. The British boat Dolphin and Youth reported a badly damaged mainsail, while the all-female entry, Heineken, suffered a broken rudder. The leaders are expected to reach Punta del Este on Friday. The 5,900-mile leg began Feb. 20 in Auckland, New Zealand. The 32,000-mile, six-leg race is expected to finish in Southampton, England, in July. (AP) TENNIS  Svensson Advances</p>
