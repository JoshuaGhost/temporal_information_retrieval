        <p>For nine months, the Muslim-controlled eastern part of Mostar suffered under ceaseless artillery and mortar bombardment, its residents huddling in dark basements while their community was destroyed and more than 2,000 of their neighbors were killed or wounded.</p>
        <p>Now, emerging into the light and surveying the ruins, people in eastern Mostar must absorb two shocks. The first is the scope of devastation here, an apocalypse beyond imagining even for people in other long-besieged cities like Sarajevo.</p>
        <p>The second is perhaps even more difficult to accept. Muslim leaders have told people here that they must now become allies of the same Croatian nationalists who, until two weeks ago, were bombing and killing them from their positions on the west bank of the Neretva River, which divides this town. Peace Pact Signed</p>
        <p>Bosnia's Croatian and Muslim leaders signed a peace accord in Washington last month. They agreed to form a federated state, and then to establish a loose union with Croatia.</p>
        <p>Three men standing amid the debris on eastern Mostar's main street were among many pondering this challenge today.</p>
        <p>"When I visit the cemetery and see the fresh graves of my students, I wonder how I can ever be friends with the Croats again," said one, Emir Zvonic, who taught school here in better times. "My family is still afraid to come out of the basement because they don't believe this cease-fire. To trust the people who have done this to us is impossible."</p>
        <p>The scale of destruction in eastern Mostar inspires awe even in those who lived through the ceaseless bombing in their underground hideouts. Not a single edifice is without heavy damage. Modern apartment towers and ancient mosques alike were blown apart. 'Unspeakable Misery'</p>
        <p>These days, people are outside for the first time since May, stolling the main streets that were once lined with shops and cafes. Some older residents promenade in their finest suits, as if to prove to themselves and the world that they have survived unbowed.</p>
        <p>Eastern Mostar is still largely sealed off from the outside world, although 37 amputees were airlifted out last week and a trickle of aid workers and journalists are allowed to pass through Croatian checkpoints.</p>
        <p>One visitor last week was the chief United Nations envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi. "I have been deeply impressed by the utter destruction of this city and the unspeakable misery in which these people must live," he said.</p>
        <p>United Nations troops and observers now patrol the streets of eastern Mostar. Plans call for them to supervise a gradual withdrawal from front-line positions and to collect weapons from both armies.</p>
        <p>In the basement of an apartment complex near what was once the center of town, 32 people from 13 families took up residence soon after the shelling began. Two were killed and six others were wounded during forays in search of food, water and firewood. All the casualties were older people, since the younger ones were not allowed to take such risks. 'We'll Never Trust Them'</p>
        <p>"I can't describe what it was like," said Razija Tanovic, 48, one woman who lived in the cellar. "Every day we woke up with the same thought, 'Oh God, will we survive this day?'</p>
        <p>"Now our Government is telling us that we should live together with the Croats. We'll do it, but we'll never trust them. We trusted them once, and look what they did to us."</p>
        <p>Mostar's Muslims and Croats were allies defending their city against Serbian attackers for three months in the spring of 1992. After they managed to fend off the Serbs, the city enjoyed a year of relative peace. But when Muslim forces in other parts of Bosnia began retaking Croatian strongholds from which they had been expelled earlier in the war, Mostar's Croats began a local "ethnic cleansing" campaign of their own.</p>
        <p>They drove thousands of Muslims from the mostly Croatian side of the Neretva to the Muslim side on the east bank. Then they began their campaign of bombardment. Human rights workers in eastern Mostar counted more than 100,000 mortar and artillery impacts in the nine months that followed.</p>
        <p>Croatian forces have many heavy weapons, most brought from Croatia. Muslims here, crippled by the United Nations' arms embargo, have only rifles and a few small-caliber mortars.</p>
        <p>As a result of this imbalance, the contrast between Mostar's two sections is stark. As Muslims creep cautiously out of their makeshift bunkers and sift through the remains of their neighborhoods, Croats on the other side of the river fill popular hangouts like the Hollywood Cafe, eating, drinking and living almost normal lives. Bridges Are Destroyed</p>
        <p>Bridges that joined Mostar's two communities were destroyed one by one. The last to fall into the Neretva was the Old Bridge, built 400 years ago by the Ottoman Emperor Suleiman the Magnificent.</p>
        <p>Two temporary bridges have been erected. Muslim soldiers nearby still fear snipers, and recommend that pedestrians cross one at a time so that snipers will have only single targets.</p>
        <p>Such concern is evidently well founded. At the makeshift hospital in eastern Mostar, victims of sniper fire are continuing to arrive.</p>
        <p>There has been no normal mail service in eastern Mostar for nine months, but messages may be transmitted through the Red Cross. Among Muslims who have maintained contact with Croatian friends across the river is Vanja Buljina, 19, whose studies were interrupted by the fighting and who now works for a relief agency. Her willingness to see beyond ethnic hatred is a glimmer of hope amid the devastation here.</p>
        <p>"I send them letters, and they reply," Miss Buljina said. "We tell each other: 'I'm still your friend. I don't care about nationality.' " General Predicts Peace</p>
        <p>Perhaps predictably, Muslim soldiers are less willing to forgive.</p>
        <p>"We were like brothers, and they put a knife in our back," said one fighter at the front line, peering out past sandbags at the decomposing body of a Muslim civilian that has been lying in no man's land for two months because Croatian snipers prevent its retrieval.</p>
        <p>But in a dim subterranean bunker, the commander of Muslim troops in Mostar and the surrounding region, Gen. Ramiz Drekovic, said he believed his men would observe the cease-fire and gradually, under United Nations supervision, allow tensions here to ease.</p>
        <p>"The fighting has gone on long enough," General Drekovic said. "People on both sides are going to have to respect this agreement. We hope it will mean peace. I believe personally that it will."</p>
