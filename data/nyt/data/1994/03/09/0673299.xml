        <p>A speeding train packed with commuters derailed early this morning and jack- knifed into a wooded gorge near Durban, flinging scores of passengers to their deaths.</p>
        <p>By tonight rescue crews had found 63 dead and 370 injured, and more were believed trapped in the wreckage of the eight cars on the train.</p>
        <p>The police said they had no reason to believe the train was sabotaged, but given a recent spate of political bombings, some on railroad lines, they were investigating the possibility.</p>
        <p>Surviving passengers said the train had accelerated faster than it usually does before leaving the rails at a sharp bend. Some passengers, alarmed at the mounting speed, hopped off as it rumbled past a station platform minutes before the crash. 800 Passengers on Train</p>
        <p>The train was carrying about 800 passengers from the suburb of Cato Ridge into Durban, South Africa's second largest city. Commuter trains in South Africa serve almost exclusively black passengers, transporting workers from outlying townships into industrial areas.</p>
        <p>Burger van Heerden, the director of the rescue effort, told the South African Press Association that rescuers were hampered by the inaccessibility of the gorge where the derailed cars came to rest. Some injured passengers were carried 500 yards on stretchers to ambulances.</p>
        <p>The train crash was the worst in South Africa since 1965, when 91 people died in a wreck near Durban.</p>
        <p>Officials from the railroad workers' union and some political parties were quick to speculate that the train might have been sabotaged by one of the groups opposing the country's first free elections in April.</p>
        <p>Since mid-December the police have reported dozens of bombings of railway lines, power pylons and African National Congress offices. But those attacks, mostly attributed to white separatists, have been confined to Afrikaner strongholds in the Orange Free State and Transvaal.</p>
        <p>Natal, the predominantly Zulu province where the crash took place, has been the main battleground between the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party. Inkatha has threatened to boycott the election, but has agreed to reconsider pending mediation of its demands for greater provincial autonomy.</p>
