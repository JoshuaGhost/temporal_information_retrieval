        <p>Penguins 7, Bruins 3</p>
        <p>Martin Straka scored three goals, including a pair 21 seconds apart in a four-goal second period last night in Pittsburgh, as the Penguins ended the Boston Bruins' six-game winning streak with a 7-3 victory.</p>
        <p>The Bruins had also been unbeaten in seven games (6-0-1). The Penguins have won their last seven games against Boston, including four this season.</p>
        <p>Straka completed his first National Hockey League hat trick with a spectacular goal at 13 minutes 59 seconds of the third. He stopped Greg Brown's pass with his hand, then outskated defenseman David Shaw to the net to put a shot past Vincent Riendeau.</p>
        <p>Ray Bourque opened the scoring in the second period with a short-handed goal that gave Boston a 1-1 tie. Straka answered with his first two goals. He tipped Larry Murphy's point shot one second after a power play expired and he then cleaned up a Kjell Samuelsson rebound.</p>
        <p>Mario Lemieux scored for Pittsburgh during a delayed penalty. He tapped in a rebound for his seventh goal in 11 games this season. Nordiques 5, Senators 2</p>
        <p>At Quebec, Ron Sutter scored a pair of goals -- the second into an empty net in the last minute -- as the Nordiques handed Ottawa its sixth straight loss.</p>
        <p>The Nordiques, who rank 25th out of 26 teams in power-play efficiency, notched three goals with the man advantage. Besides Sutter, Valery Kamensky and Joe Sakic connected for power-play goals. Stars 4, Flyers 3</p>
        <p>Neal Broten scored a power-play goal 2:43 into overtime to give Dallas the victory in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Broten poked in a rebound from the left side of the net for the game-winner as the Stars snapped a three-game winless streak (0-2-1). Philadelphia's Dave Tippett was penalized at 2:01 of the final period for holding his stick.</p>
        <p>Dallas is 11-1-1 this season when Broten scores.</p>
        <p>The Stars, 4-1-2 against Atlantic Division opponents this season, also snapped a six-game losing streak in Philadelphia. The Stars are 6-3-2 in their last 11 games.  HOCKEY</p>
