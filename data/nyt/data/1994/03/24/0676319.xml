        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he would sign a bill that will extend most of the city's rent control and rent stabilization rules but lift controls from at least 1,500 apartments with relatively wealthy tenants over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who had originally supported a straight extension of the current rent regulations, said that because the regulations were to expire on April 1, he had little choice but to support the legislation that was forwarded to him by the City Council, which passed it on Monday.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he would sign a bill that will extend most of the city's rent control and rent stabilization rules but lift controls from at least 1,500 apartments with relatively wealthy tenants over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who had originally supported a straight extension of the current rent regulations, said that because the regulations were to expire on April 1, he had little choice but to support the legislation that was forwarded to him by the City Council, which passed it on Monday.</p>
        <p>"This is the law that is in front of me at this point in time, and I have elected to insure that rent stabilization protections remain in place," he said in a written statement. If rent protections were to expire, he said, "the result would be disastrous for the residents of more than 1 million households."</p>
        <p>The legislation, approved 28 to 18 by the Council after emotionally charged debate, expands a plan passed by the State Legislature last summer that deregulated about 12,000 luxury apartments. Doubts on Aid to Rich</p>
        <p>"I find it highly doubtful that anyone believes that these rent regulations exist to benefit those wealthiest individuals," the Mayor said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the change in rent regulations expressed disappointment at the Mayor's announcement. "I would have preferred that he vetoed it," said City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Manhattan Democrat, who said that apartments could have been recontrolled retroactively if the April 1 deadline had passed without a new law in place. "That's an excuse, not a reason."</p>
        <p>It remains unclear whether the provision in both the state and local laws requiring tenants to reveal their income can be enforced or will stand court tests, Council staff members said. Although the state law has yet to be challenged, lawsuits are expected since tenants could argue that asking for their tax returns would be an invasion of privacy.</p>
