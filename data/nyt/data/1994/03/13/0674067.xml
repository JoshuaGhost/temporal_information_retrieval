        <p>One noteworthy addition to your glowing Streetscapes profile of the American Radiator Building ("A 1924 Precursor of Art Deco," Feb. 20) is an acknowledgment that this New York City landmark has been immortalized by one of America's finest painters. In 1927, three years after the building opened, Georgia O'Keeffe painted "Radiator Building -- Night, New York," one of a series of New York cityscapes. In the painting O'Keeffe depicts a nocturnal view of the dark tower brightly lit by the floodlighting that made the building such a popular spectacle in its heyday.</p>

        <p>One can only imagine what an uplifting experience it would be in 1994 to sit in the refurbished Bryant Park on a pleasant summer evening and gaze up at a dazzling Radiator Building tower. Developers wake up -- this is another New York City attraction waiting to be rediscovered.  GEORGE ZITO  Fort Lee, N.J.</p>
