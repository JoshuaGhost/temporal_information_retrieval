        <p>As an aerosol spray, it's quite a puzzle. The label of the product, commonly sold in bodegas and delis, reads Money House Blessing Gold Spray With Indian Spirit. What? The label is cryptic and obscure, but it certainly seems to suggest that using the spray will bring a blessing or money. Telephone pursuit of the makers of Money House Blessing led to E. Davis Inc., of Piscataway, N.J., a spokesman and the following interview:</p>
        <p>Q: Hi.</p>
        <p>A: I want to tell you that we do not seek publicity for this product.</p>
        <p>Q: Do you think this spray has spiritual or magical powers?</p>
        <p>A: I won't comment on that.</p>
        <p>Q: Do your customers believe it will bring them money?</p>
        <p>A: That would be conjecture.</p>
        <p>Q: Who is the Indian on the label?</p>
        <p>A: I won't say where he came from.</p>
        <p>Q: What is the Genuine 9 Indian Gold Oil that's mentioned on the label? Is it real gold?</p>
        <p>A: I can't comment on that. I've already given you more information than I've ever given anyone else.</p>
        <p>Q: The label is bilingual. Do you have many Spanish-speaking customers?</p>
        <p>A: All types of people buy it. Across the board, all over the country. This product has been very successful for us and we don't want to tamper with that.</p>
        <p>Q: The label says, "Money House Blessing. . . .  There's Nothing Like It!" Is that true?</p>
        <p>A: Yes. To the degree that when you use it it works better than anything else.</p>
        <p>Q: Better at what? What does it do?</p>
        <p>A: Freshens the air.</p>
        <p>Q: That's it?</p>
        <p>A: That's it.  SUNDAY, MARCH 13, 1994</p>
