        <p>It must be enormously difficult to be a 15-year-old whose every move is watched with consuming fascination.  Kimberly Mays lives that way, working out the tangled loyalties of her life while trailed by dozens of reporters, television cameras and celebrity photographers.</p>
        <p>Her latest encounter with the difficulties of growing up was played out in full view last week, after she announced that she had run away from her Englewood, Fla., home and had decided to live with Ernest and Regina Twigg of Sebring, Fla., the biological parents she legally "divorced" last summer.</p>

        <p>It must be enormously difficult to be a 15-year-old whose every move is watched with consuming fascination.  Kimberly Mays lives that way, working out the tangled loyalties of her life while trailed by dozens of reporters, television cameras and celebrity photographers.</p>
        <p>Her latest encounter with the difficulties of growing up was played out in full view last week, after she announced that she had run away from her Englewood, Fla., home and had decided to live with Ernest and Regina Twigg of Sebring, Fla., the biological parents she legally "divorced" last summer.</p>
        <p>Kimberly was switched at birth in a hospital with the ailing daughter of Robert Mays and his late wife, Barbara. The Twiggs raised the other child, Arlena, until she died of a congenital heart ailment at the age of 10, and genetic testing revealed she was not a blood relative. They discovered Kimberly was their biological daughter, and sought custody. After five years of litigation, the court last summer permitted Kimberly to sever ties with the Twiggs in order to stay with Mr. Mays and his current wife, Darlena.</p>
        <p>But two weeks ago, Kimberly fled to a Sarasota teen shelter following a "parent-teen conflict" with the Mayses, according to a lawyer's statement. She announced last week that she and her two families had decided she would now live with the Twiggs. SARA KENNEDY</p>
