        <p>Plans to transform the abandoned Macy's on Flatbush Avenue into a Caldor's have hit a surprise snag, community leaders and elected officials said last week.</p>
        <p>The Giuliani administration, looking for ways to cut a daunting budget gap, has proposed removing from its capital improvements budget a $4 million contribution toward parking for the project, including a rooftop lot on the new structure to be built for the store. A total of $10 million in city financing for the 645 parking spaces was pivotal in persuading Caldor's to lease the site. The new store would be one of a wave of large discounters now moving into the city.</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor John S. Dyson met on Tuesday with Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden and officials of Forest City Ratner Companies, a Brooklyn-based company that bought the site last year, to discuss the problem. Caldor's declined to comment.</p>
        <p>"We are optimistic that this will be resolved," said Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner, who said that the lot was crucial in the company's ability to lure Caldor's, with 136 stores one of the largest discounters in the Northeast. "But we are concerned."</p>
        <p>The lot is designed in two sections, with 300 spaces on the roof of the new store at Flatbush and Tilden Avenues and the remainder near Sears at 2307 Beverly Road, a site the city agreed to acquire. Mr. Golden set aside $6 million for the project, and the city was supposed to come up with the rest, he said.</p>
        <p>"Caldor's is very important to that area and so is the lot," said Mr. Dyson, who declined to discuss details of the meeting. "So, we're working hard to find a way to make things work out."</p>
        <p>As part of its bankruptcy agreement, Macy's closed its Flatbush Avenue store in 1992. The store was the anchor of the Flatbush Avenue retail hub for more than 40 years.</p>
        <p>Last October, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the store to Forest City Ratner, which will demolish the existing building and build a new 90,000-square foot department store, the total cost of which is estimated to be $20 million. L.H.  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FLATBUSH</p>
