        <p>Senior officials of the South African Police armed and assisted Zulu nationalists in a campaign of partisan warfare, political hit squads and terrorist attacks, according to testimony disclosed today by a judicial inquest.</p>

        <p>Senior officials of the South African Police armed and assisted Zulu nationalists in a campaign of partisan warfare, political hit squads and terrorist attacks, according to testimony disclosed today by a judicial inquest.</p>
        <p>The report by Judge Richard J. Goldstone, the chairman of a standing commission on violence, was the strongest evidence South Africans have seen of what is popularly called a "third force" -- a conspiracy within top levels of the security forces to sabotage the transition to majority rule.</p>
        <p>Judge Goldstone said the investigation, while not yet complete, was being made public because unless the plotters were thwarted they might succeed in aborting the country's first nonracial elections next month. Embarrassment for de Klerk</p>
        <p>The disclosures, less than six weeks before the election, were a major embarrassment for President F. W. de Klerk, who has been campaigning for black votes by blaming the African National Congress for the country's violence.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Klerk, struggling to seize the initiative in the worst scandal of his presidency, appeared alongside Judge Goldstone at a news conference tonight and said all the police officers implicated in the report would be placed on immediate leave. He proposed that international police experts be invited to pursue the investigation.</p>
        <p>"I have an absolutely clear conscience," Mr. de Klerk said, when challenged on his ability to control his own security forces. "There's no suggestion in this report that we knew about this or should have known about this. There's no suggestion of Government involvement."</p>
        <p>The report did not suggest that Mr. de Klerk or any of his Cabinet members knew of the subversion being directed within the police, and Mr. Goldstone praised the President for cooperating with the investigation. Pressure to Move on KwaZulu</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most difficult question Mr. de Klerk now faces is whether to move against the volatile KwaZulu homeland, the fief of Mangosuthu G. Buthelezi. The Goldstone report implicated senior officials of Mr. Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party and top officers of his homeland police force in death-squad violence. Mr. Buthelezi's party is boycotting the election.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Klerk will certainly come under pressure to take control of the Zulu homeland from Mr. Buthelezi, who is, among other things, the minister of police in the homeland. Last week Mr. de Klerk sent the army to take control of another defiant homeland, Bophuthatswana, after an uprising begun by civil servants who feared for their futures if they were left out of the elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buthelezi warned on Thursdaythat KwaZulu, where the Zulu King commands a devoted following, would not be so easily overcome. Any move against KwaZulu, he threatened, "will spawn a struggle for liberation" that he said "will have no parallel in Africa."</p>
        <p>But the fact that KwaZulu police officials are among the witnesses who have begun coming forward with information on police abuses was a sign that Mr. Buthelezi's hold on the homeland may be weakening.</p>
        <p>Nelson Mandela, the president of the African National Congress, canceled two public appearances in KwaZulu this week because, congress officials said, they feared an attempt on his life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstone said his commission's investigation had not identified specific plots against Mr. Mandela or other senior A.N.C. figures, but the judge's report makes clear why Mr. Mandela would not want to rely on the KwaZulu police for his safety. Number Killed Is Unknown</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstone said the commission had not yet determined how many people were killed as a result of the police conspiracy.</p>
        <p>"The impression I have is that the scale is serious in terms of the number of people whose lives were lost," he said. Asked if the death squads and other activities were still operating, he said, "It's an open question."</p>
        <p>Even for South Africans jaded by tales of police malfeasance, the report released today was a stunning saga of uninhibited police power.</p>
        <p>Witnesses, themselves police officers, told the inquest that from 1989 until "the very recent past" Lieut. Gen. Basie Smit, now the second-in-command of the South African Police, and Maj. Gen. Krappies Engelbrecht, now the chief of counterintelligence, oversaw a network that supplied automatic rifles, grenades, mortars and other weapons to Inkatha. General and 20 Others Named</p>
        <p>Another general and 20 lower-ranking officers were identified in the report as participants in the activities.</p>
        <p>The report suggested that the police were driven by their desire to prevent majority rule, but it also reports that they skimmed large sums of money from the transactions.</p>
        <p>According to the report, the police obtained weapons from Namibia and Mozambique, filed off the serial numbers and gave them to Inkatha warriors in KwaZulu and the battle-torn black townships east of Johannesburg. For a time, the commission was told, the police actually ran a factory to produce homemade guns for Inkatha.</p>
        <p>The evidence indicated that the police network orchestrated massacres of train commuters, trained Inkatha hit men and took part in killings of A.N.C. rivals.</p>
        <p>To finance their operations, the police had access to a large secret slush fund. To disguise their activities they obtained false passports from the Government, and created front companies.</p>
        <p>When members of the network were in danger of being exposed, they were retired with generous severance bonuses. In one case, the report said, the Cabinet authorized an unusual $340,000 payout to the commander of a secret police unit when he was discharged. The report said he continued his gun-running as a civilian.</p>
        <p>Inkatha has long been a favorite of hard-liners in the South African Police and military, dating from the days when the Government found the Zulu organization a useful ally in an all-out war against the banned African National Congress.</p>
        <p>Previous investigations have disclosed Government financing of Inkatha and military training of Inkatha members, but this is the first to implicate the police directly in the violence. Anonymous Police Testimony</p>
        <p>The investigation began last month with testimony from a police officer identified only as Q who cooperated with Mr. Goldstone under a promise of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The commission managed to corroborate many peripheral details of his story, including the issuance of false passports and records of ammunition purchased from a gun dealer.</p>
        <p>Then on Wednesday and Thursday the commission brought the accused policemen to a luxury hotel in Johannesburg, placed them individually in guarded rooms with no telephones, and conducted a whirlwind interrogation.</p>
        <p>Several of the accused confirmed key details of the plot, the report said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstone said that with this corroboration the commission rushed to make the information public, completing the report at 3:30 this morning.</p>
        <p>"If those intent on further destabilization succeed in aborting the election, an investigation afterward would be a futile exercise," the report said.</p>
