        <p>THE Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is still sorting through its records to identify the 92,000 or so customers it estimates are eligible for refunds of policies improperly sold by some of its agents from 1989 through 1993.</p>
        <p>The nature of the misdeeds varied. Agents in Tampa, Fla., misled customers across the country by describing life insurance policies as retirement or savings plans. Agents near Pittsburgh specialized in persuading customers to trade in or borrow from old policies to buy new ones, even though the exchange was not in the best interest of the customer.</p>
        <p>One common theme to the improper activities was the agents' desire to earn a big commission from the sale of a new policy, rather than banking on a long-lasting customer relationship. Agents of companies that do business in New York commonly receive 55 percent of their total commission in the first year, then 5 percent annually for nine years. Some companies pay even more up front.</p>
        <p>Selling life insurance can certainly be a tough business. Three-fourths of all new agents last less than five years, and a recent issue of Money magazine said the average income of the country's 230,000 life insurance agents was $35,000.</p>
        <p>So insurance company executives defend the way commissions are paid as a necessary incentive for the sales staff. But criticism of the current commission system is emerging.</p>
        <p>In Pennsylvania, which recently fined Met Life $1.5 million and extracted a promise that the company would rescind policies that were improperly sold, legislators are considering new limits on insurance sales practices.</p>
        <p>One part of the Pennsylvania bill would limit commissions paid to agents and their supervisors to 10 percent a year when a policy is sold as a replacement for an older one. The bill would also limit commissions on new policies to a maximum of 50 percent in the first year.</p>
        <p>The proposal would also require agents to disclose to their customers the commission they will earn on the sale, which is standard practice in the securities business.</p>
        <p>In New York, where the insurance department rules on limiting agents' commissions and other bonuses are already stricter than many other states, officials say changes may be coming, with an eye toward changing commissions so that agents are rewarded for building customer relationships rather than how quickly they can make a sale.</p>
        <p>Mary Griffin, an insurance expert at Consumers Union, the research organization, said all proposals to change compensation "involve some spreading out of the commission over more years, so the incentive is to serve the client better."</p>
        <p>In Canada, many companies are moving toward reducing commissions that now equal 75 percent of the first year's premium. Among the five largest companies, the most radical change has been at Mutual Life of Canada, which in 1989 began paying agents a 15 percent commission as long as the policy exists.</p>
        <p>"Because agents receive the same compensation on older policies as new policies, we find they are providing a lot more service to existing clients," said Daniel Lauzon, sales force commission officer at Mutual Life, in Waterloo, Ontario. He said that only 5.5 to 6 percent of the company's policies lapsed now, compared with 7.5 to 8 percent before 1989.</p>
        <p>Among Mutual Life's 1500 sales agents, Mr. Lauzon said older agents with a long list of customers were earning more than before, because the company is paying the 15 percent annually on existing policies, on which it previously payed as little as 2 percent. New agents are earning about the same as under the old system with the help of a more generous salary paid by the companies in the first few years of their employment, he said.  INSURANCE</p>
