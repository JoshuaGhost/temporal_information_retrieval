        <p>MOVING from the old computing model of mainframes and minicomputers to the world of client-server computing is like building a bridge. Without powerful tools, you can't get there from here.</p>
        <p>Most corporations reside in a kind of computing limbo, with their core sales data, payroll, inventory and all other vital information perhaps on an I.B.M. mainframe running DB2, or minicomputers running Oracle.

        <p>MOVING from the old computing model of mainframes and minicomputers to the world of client-server computing is like building a bridge. Without powerful tools, you can't get there from here.</p>
        <p>Most corporations reside in a kind of computing limbo, with their core sales data, payroll, inventory and all other vital information perhaps on an I.B.M. mainframe running DB2, or minicomputers running Oracle. They would like to get to an environment where their programs could run on networks of personal computers and servers, which are a much cheaper and friendlier source of computing power. But making the move requires a set of programming skills and tools seldom to be found on either the mainframe side or the PC side.</p>
        <p>Two companies that have focused on filling that gap are the Gupta Corporation, of Menlo Park, Calif., and the Powersoft Corporation of Burlington, Mass. Both produce tools that allow corporate programmers to create new custom applications by "painting" them on the screen -- clicking on symbols with a mouse, dragging them across the screen and "dropping" them elsewhere -- rather than by writing endless lines of code. Both had very successful initial public offerings of stock last year; both have revenues in the $50 million range, and both are growing rapidly.</p>
        <p>Gupta and Powersoft's products, introduced in the late 80's but hitting their stride only in the last two years with the upswing in client-server computing, are not for programming neophytes. Instead they are aimed at programmers who have a background either in mainframe computing languages like Cobol, or in personal computer languages like dBase or Visual Basic. The companies provide a link between these two very different worlds. Both companies' tools work with all the major relational data base programs, like Oracle, Sybase or Informix, which most corporations use.</p>
        <p>Both use Structured Query Language, or SQL, the standard language for speaking to relational data base programs. Relational data base software allows a user to assemble data from a number of different sources.</p>
        <p>"What Powersoft and Gupta bring us that is most laudable is visual programming, by drag and drop," said Mike West, an analyst with the Gartner Group in Santa Clara, Calif.</p>
        <p>"As you drop a 'scrolling list' box on the screen, underneath, all that code is coming with it," he said. Still, he adds, "it isn't enough all by itself; you must get in and do some text."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the programs speed the creation of graphical user interfaces -- the symbols and menus that enable the non-techies in accounts payable and other corporate end-users to get at the company's data base without needing to be programmers themselves. But creating those interfaces can represent 80 percent of the work an in-house programmer puts in to create a new application.</p>
        <p>That's where Gupta's SQL Windows and Powersoft's Powerbuilder can save time for the in-house corporate programmers. SQL Windows and Powersoft automatically provide the interface basics -- commonly used items like button bars and dialogue boxes, which can be dropped into a program. In effect, the programs exploit the ease of use of Microsoft's Windows operating system software to create new programs more easily.</p>
        <p>"In the 90's, instead of high-level languages, it's high-level tools," said Adam Green, a consultant based in Cambridge, Mass.</p>
        <p>Programmers must still write code for the underlying actions and "events" that the user interface functions are meant to prompt, so SQL Windows and Powerbuilder contain their own programming languages. Because some customers may want to create functions that are beyond the capacity of those languages, the programs also can be extended to work with many of the leading programming languages, like C++.</p>
        <p>"A toolset of this kind is intended primarily for a programmers who wants to build an application, to make them more productive and quicker," said Umang Gupta, Gupta's president and chief executive. "Most of the customers using our product are moving down from mainframe and minicomputer tools."</p>
        <p>These tools can be deployed in large, complex systems of PC's. The Dreyfus Corporation, the big mutual fund company, is using Gupta's SQL Windows to create a common interface for a data base of financial information and client accounts, spread over six software systems on two mainframes. These half-dozen data bases were all created at different times, using different software tools.</p>
        <p>Dreyfus's new consolidated system will run a custom application created with Gupta products on PC's. The flow of data between desktops and mainframes will be handled by I.B.M. RS 6000 server computers, running Sybase's SQL Server relational data base software.</p>
        <p>Another major attraction of the Gupta and Powersoft tools is that the drag-and-drop approach is a form of object-oriented programming, making it easier to create custom applications. Object-oriented programming is a modular approach to writing software that incorporates functional and descriptive code in reusable chunks.</p>
        <p>Developers can create applications using objects supplied with SQL Windows or Powerbuilder, or buy objects from independent software developers.</p>
        <p>Tim Theriault, vice president of trust systems at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, cited object-oriented programming, quick development times and ease of use for in-house software programmers with little PC experience as reasons the company chose Powersoft tools to add a graphic, interactive interface to its systems. "The other piece of good news is Powersoft's commitment to multiple clients," he said, using the techspeak term for a melange of brands of desktop machines and operating systems.</p>
        <p>So far, Gupta and Powersoft have concentrated on the corporate market, each pricing their products at just under $4,000 for a complete developer's kit. But, perceiving a niche in serving smaller business customers, Powersoft earlier this month introduced a stripped version of its toolset, called Powerbuilder Desktop, at an introductory price of $249. The company is also offering one-day training seminars at 56 sites worldwide for $399, which includes software.</p>
        <p>"We see that as a new market, the person who is using dBase, Paradox, Access or Clipper and feels they are at a technological dead end, and would like to move to client-server," said Mitchell E. Kertzman, Powersoft's chairman and chief executive. He was referring to PC data base products from Borland, Microsoft and Computer Associates, none of which are client-server software packages. "We've tested out this course with some of the leading people in the dBase world and had very positive responses," he said.</p>
        <p>Although Gupta sells its own relational data base program, SQL Base, and Powersoft sells a program called Watcom SQL, their products are very often used with software from the big data base providers, like the Oracle Systems Corporation and Sybase Inc. Analysts say the data base suppliers lagged in introducing development tools that were truly client-server-oriented, and that took advantage of the graphic orientation of Windows. This left the opening into which stepped Powersoft and Gupta. But nearly all of the data base companies have recently announced new tools, and they will be a force in the market, analysts say.</p>
        <p>"The tools market is highly fragmented and there's no such thing as one all-purpose tool which can be used for all projects and environments," said Robert Epstein, executive vice president and co-founder of Sybase.</p>
