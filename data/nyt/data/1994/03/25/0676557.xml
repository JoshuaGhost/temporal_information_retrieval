        <p>Eating in most museums is like eating on an airplane; you do it because you're hungry but it doesn't feel very good. We all know it does not have to be this way, which is why there was such a surge of optimism when the Museum of Modern Art announced that an elegant new restaurant would soon be opening on the premises. Were we about to enter a new era of museum dining?</p>

        <p>Eating in most museums is like eating on an airplane; you do it because you're hungry but it doesn't feel very good. We all know it does not have to be this way, which is why there was such a surge of optimism when the Museum of Modern Art announced that an elegant new restaurant would soon be opening on the premises. Were we about to enter a new era of museum dining?</p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>Sette Moma occupies a vast, airy space on the second floor of the museum. A great wall of windows overlooks one of New York's loveliest open spaces. Lots of waiters go rushing about. The walls are covered with impressive pieces of art. (Roy Lichtenstein's "Entablature" has been replaced by two huge works by Josef Albers.) Still, the room looks like a high-class cafeteria.</p>
        <p>The grease spots on the menu don't help. Neither does the stale bread in the baskets. And the service is sometimes so irritating you find yourself wishing you could just help yourself. Ask for "thin slices of smoked fish with oil and lemon," and the waiter looks puzzled. Then his brow clears. "Ah, carpaccio di pesce," he says reprovingly, as if you have somehow blundered. Given half a chance, he is very pleased to help you pronounce "orecchiette," sounding out the syllables: ohr-ay-KYEHT-ee.</p>
        <p>Then, after all that trouble, the pasta is tepid when it arrives. You look down at your plate and wonder why you are here.</p>
        <p>It is convenient, for one thing; if you want to spend the day at the museum, this is a better option than the cafeteria downstairs with its endless lines. It is also glamorous; at lunch the room is filled with the buzz of power. Is that a famous artist over there? Heads turn. Surely that elegant man over there is the celebrated curator?</p>
        <p>When a grande dame sweeps in, everyone in the room turns to look. She folds herself into the chair at the next table and surveys the room. She has good bones and good clothes, and when she orders a plain green salad and a plate of spaghetti with tomato sauce her voice sounds like money.</p>
        <p>Clearly she has eaten here before; she knows pasta is the best bet at Sette Moma. Tortellacci di caprino, melanzane e ricotta (round ravioli filled with goat cheese, eggplant and ricotta) would be delicious if the plump little pillows were hot. Fusilli with artichokes and tomato sauce, a special, comes dotted with little squares of mozzarella; it is a pleasant dish, the sort of thing you might make for yourself at home. Gnocchi are unremarkable. And the linguine alle vongole turn out to be the best thing on the menu, a simple plate of nicely cooked pasta tossed with small sweet clams still in their shells.</p>
        <p>Salads are pretty safe too, provided your expectations are not great. Insalata Sette Moma is a familiar mix of mesclun, marinated red peppers, mushrooms, olives and capers. Tricolore con parmigiano, a toss of arugula, radicchio and endive, is predictable, too.</p>
        <p>You have seen this menu before, dozens of times. Sette Moma has written something that is almost a parody of the Italian menu in America, beginning with carpaccio and ending with tiramisu. In between are Caesar salad, spaghetti with tomatoes and basil, and a grilled veal chop. The sole departure from triteness in the antipasto department is calamaretti dorati, an unfortunate foray into experimentation. Small squid seem to have been breaded before grilling, leaving them with an unpleasantly mushy texture.</p>
        <p>The main courses run the gamut from unremarkable to unexciting. Nothing is terrible; nothing is memorable. If the prices were half what they are, you might not mind so much. But when lamb chops cost $25, the least you can expect is that they be cooked as requested. But here they are, what were supposed to be medium chops, dusted with rosemary and thyme and still quivering red at the center. Veal Milanese, a great piece of pounded veal still on the bone, is almost tasteless beneath its tired topping of diced tomatoes and arugula. Galletto al mattone, a flattened grilled baby chicken, might once have had a crisp skin, but by the time it arrives at the table the crispness has faded. The dice of eggplant, peppers and zucchini on the side is simply salty.</p>
        <p>Frittura mista, a heap of fried calamari and fried shrimp, tastes just fine, but all the seafood has been carelessly tossed onto the plate. The result is an unappealing pile of food that suffers by comparison with what is served in other restaurants; Amarcord, for instance, presents this dish in a beautiful potato basket.</p>
        <p>Dessert is a puzzle. Cheesecake? Tiramisu? Gelato? The woman with the voice like money asks for the fresh fruit tart, and a person would be wise to follow suit. The little round of raspberry-topped pastry is very pretty, very delicious and very superior to the sweet coffee creme brulee and the even sweeter cheesecake.</p>
        <p>With the bill comes the realization that all this convenience has been rather expensive; a three-course lunch for two without wine can cost $100 with tax and tip. On an airplane you are trapped, but at the Museum of Modern Art you are surrounded by some of the world's best restaurants. Many of them would be happy to feed you better for less. Sette Moma</p>
        <p>Satisfactory</p>
        <p>11 West 53d Street (in the Museum of Modern Art), Manhattan; after 5 P.M. the entrance is through the back of the museum at 12 West 54th Street, (212) 708-9710.</p>
        <p>Atmosphere: The big, bright, open, modern room overlooks the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden, but in spite of the important view and the important art that fills the room, it does not feel like an important restaurant.</p>
        <p>Service: Perfunctory.</p>
        <p>Recommended dishes: Linguine allea vongole; orecchiette with broccoli; penne with pancetta, radicchio and smoked cheese; frittura mista; fresh fruit tart.</p>
        <p>Wine list: The small assortment of mostly Italian wines has some interesting choices. Unfortunately, in five visits, no one offered me the list; I always had to ask.</p>
        <p>Hours: Lunch: noon to 3 P.M daily except Wednesdays; dinner: 5 to 11 P.M. daily except Wednesdays and Sundays.</p>
        <p>Price range: Appetizers $6 to $12, pastas $13 to $17, main courses $16 to $25, desserts $7.</p>
        <p>Credit cards: All major cards.</p>
        <p>Wheelchair accessible.</p>
        <p>What the stars mean: (None) Poor to Satisfactory * Good ** Very Good *** Excellent **** Extraordinary</p>
        <p>Ratings reflect the reviewer's reaction primarily to food, with ambiance and service taken into consideration. Menu listings and prices are subject to change.</p>
