        <p>When Marshella Atkinson's parents decided to leave Brooklyn for Long Island, the enthusiasm of friends and teachers made her smile with anticipation.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they pictured the swimming pools of nearby Levittown, or the shopping centers of Garden City, or the well-stocked library and spotless corridors of Plainview-Old Bethpage High School. Ms. Atkinson is not sure.</p>
        <p>But four years later, the 16-year-old does know one thing: They could not have meant Roosevelt, where boarded-up houses dot the walk home from high school and people complain that their streets are last to be plowed by the Town of Hempstead, where Roosevelt is the most troubled section.</p>
        <p>"I think they set it up so that when a black family moves here, it ends up in Roosevelt," said Ms. Atkinson, a junior at Roosevelt High School. She glanced at a hole in her classroom ceiling where tiles had been ripped away.  Graffiti scarred the walls. "I thought it was going to be a dream place," she said.</p>
        <p>Drawn by the promise of escape from inner-city congestion and violence, more and more families like the Atkinsons are moving to America's suburbs. Like the white middle class before them, they come for a home of their own, good schools, open spaces and relative safety, everything that the suburbs symbolize in the American narrative.</p>
        <p>But segregation is not declining as black and Hispanic people move to the suburbs, according to John R. Logan, a sociologist at the State University of New York at Albany, who has studied segregation around 10 major cities. Nationally, 1 black person in 3 now lives in the suburbs, but even those with middle-class incomes usually end up in middle-class pockets of poorer neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Lily-white communities tend not to become integrated but to remain largely lily-white, with the addition of well-defined minority precincts. On Long Island, 95 percent of black residents are concentrated in 5 percent of the census tracts. According to census data, the average white person in Nassau County lives in a census tract in which only 8 percent of the residents are black or Hispanic. The average white child attends a school that is just 9 percent black.</p>
        <p>In New York City, by contrast, the comparable figure is 18 percent on either score, or more than twice the degree of integration, said Dr. Andrew A. Beveridge, director of the Program of Applied Social Research at Queens College of the City University of New York, who analyzed the data.</p>
        <p>Suffolk, slightly less segregated than Nassau, is more like suburbs around the country, Professor Beveridge said. Laws Have No Effect</p>
        <p>"Both within cities and suburbs, Hispanics and blacks are segregated, and they're forced to locate in the least desirable communities," Professor Logan said. "And I see no evidence that any change in civil rights laws or fair housing legislation is having any effect."</p>
        <p>Of course, some blacks choose to live in black neighborhoods. Others opted for integrated areas that white flight has since rendered mostly black. Still others can afford only the cheapest suburban housing. But a great many blacks complain they are never shown the full range of housing choices or are discouraged from buying in predominantly white communities.</p>
        <p>Once they arrive, blacks find that the suburban landscape and the suburban way of life increase racial isolation: The tendency to restrict parks, libraries and other amenities to local residents; to rely on cars rather than on mass transit, and to emphasize home rule in government promote a segregated existence, no matter what the intent. White Flight  Integration, Then Racial Isolation</p>
        <p>While the Long Island suburbs, in their postwar expansion, were providing the blueprint for an America of the automobile age, the plan accepted white prejudices of the day, typically restricting the emerging communities to "members of the Caucasian race."</p>
        <p>Federal laws now bar discrimination, but mechanisms of segregation endure. James Thomas landed in the Suffolk County hamlet of Bellport after a thwarted attempt to buy a house in white Port Jefferson 33 years ago. Mr. Thomas's mailman, who was white, offered to sell Mr. Thomas his Cape Cod in Bellport for $10,500. "You have to take where you can get," the retired factory supervisor said.</p>
        <p>For 20 years, Bellport remained a "solid, good community." But what he thought was steady integration turned out to be a white hemorrhage. A decade ago, Mr. Thomas realized that the people moving in were no longer working class or middle class but getting by on government aid. Bellport became as blighted as any city neighborhood, its streets lined with prostitutes and certain corners given over to drug dealing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas looked across the hedges at a house that had burned down several months before: a jungle of exposed wires and half-fallen floors. For him, the delay in razing the house, since removed, was sure proof of the Town of Brookhaven's disregard for blacks. "You can't tell me that this would be left to stand this way in a white neighborhood," he said. Services Dwindle</p>
        <p>Whites who bought homes in the suburbs typically began a lifelong climb up the social and economic ladder. Many blacks are forced to watch their investment decline as whites flee, poorer minorities move in and services dwindle. Homeowners like Ed Larson of the North Amityville Taxpayers Association meet to enlist police against drug peddlers, prostitutes and street crime, problems that seldom preoccupy their white counterparts.</p>
        <p>"If the American dream is to buy a house in the suburbs, send your kid to a good school and have some grass, yes, it's the American dream," said Hugh A. Wilson, director of the Institute for Suburban Studies at Adelphi University. "If it's also to do that in an integrated setting, then for blacks, it's not fulfilling the dream."</p>
        <p>Some blacks complain that isolation feeds a quiet acceptance of racism. Alton Williams, first vice president of the Nassau County Guardians, which represents black police officers, said he was shocked to see a white supremacist flyer on another officer's bulletin board. It showed a smiling blond child with the caption "MISSING: A future for white children in America."</p>
        <p>"The fear is that if people from the inner city come out to this pristine land, it will be ruined," said Melvin Boone, president of the Guardians. "And by saying 'people from the inner city,' who are they talking about?"</p>
        <p>"They're talking about me," Mr. Williams replied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boone nodded. "And about me," he said. Fragmented Power  Property Taxes Punish Blacks</p>
        <p>In Roosevelt, 70 of the 92 members of the volunteer fire department are black. But last week the New York State Attorney General disclosed that for 26 years blacks had been kept out of a fraternal group that provided insurance for Roosevelt firefighters. The group was ordered to open its doors and pay $53,000 in retroactive benefits.</p>
        <p>While overt racism is not the norm, many experts say that political and institutional barriers work against minority residents.</p>
        <p>For example, the tax system on Long Island appears to penalize minorities. According an analysis of Census data, blacks on Long Island and in many other suburbs pay higher rates of property taxes than homeowners in more affluent white communities. Poorer blacks in effect subsidize wealthier whites.</p>
        <p>In Suffolk County, blacks pay 17.6 percent higher property taxes than whites on homes of comparable market value, while in Nassau the figure is 5.6 percent. The data, which compared homes bought by blacks and whites in the 1980's, may actually understate the disparity by not including property taxes for longtime homeowners.</p>
        <p>Tax experts say the disparity reflects voter pressure that protects the status quo and deters governments from reassessing properties in a timely fashion. As real estate values in many white communities soared throughout the 1980's, homes were seldom reassessed. When growing numbers of minority families were funneled into suburban neighborhoods where values dropped as whites began to flee, their homes were not reassessed downward either.</p>
        <p>Overtaxing minority communities contributes to the higher number of foreclosures in these areas, said George Peterson of the Urban Institute. Money that homeowners could have spent on upkeep goes instead to pay bloated tax bills, planning officials say. Roosevelt's residents, like Sheila Caballero, executive director of the I Am Corporation, a nonprofit group that works to build self-esteem among black youngsters, say the neighborhood has only become more run down with the years. No Blacks Elected Countywide</p>
        <p>Neither Nassau nor Suffolk has ever elected a black to countywide office. Nassau is under a court order to overhaul its form of government for failing adequately to represent the county's minority residents, 14 percent of its population.</p>
        <p>At the town level, officials are typically elected at large, making it difficult for black or Hispanic people to be elected or to win support for issues important to their neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Ms. Caballero, who has campaigned for a youth center in Roosevelt, says the Hempstead Town Board, which elected its first black member last year, is consistently more attuned to the wealthier voters of Garden City. "Everywhere we turn, we're in a box, and we can't figure out how to get out of that box," she said. The Next Generation  Patchwork Quilt Of School Districts</p>
        <p>In the public schools, too, many minority residents say they are ill served by a patchwork of school districts that protects local control over enrollment, programs and curriculum. The combination replicates in suburbia the disparities that the New York State Department of Education recently said most glaringly divide school districts in white, middle class suburbs from minority, low-income urban districts.</p>
        <p>Recently, Raymond Mattry, a program coordinator for I Am, took some Roosevelt students to Plainview-Old Bethpage High School, where the New York Civil Liberties Union had come for an anti-hate workshop.  Akilah Watkins, a junior from Roosevelt, seemed shocked by the contrast between her own high school and Plainview, with its almost all-white student body.</p>
        <p>At Roosevelt, library books from the 1930's describe the Treaty of Versailles as the last word in arms limitation. The football team works out in a cramped room lighted by a bare bulb, on equipment that Joseph Vito confesses he borrowed from his town's recreation center. ("I don't think they noticed it's gone," the gym teacher said, ducking his head in embarrassment.)</p>
        <p>At Plainview, the science chairman, Saul Reine, shows off his newest addition: a dedicated computer network that he was able to buy despite budget tightening.</p>
        <p>"If you walked into our high school, you'd be surprised," Ms. Watkins told the audience.  "It isn't anything like this."</p>
        <p>During a later tour of Plainview-Old Bethpage, Gail Weinstein, an assistant principal, described extra steps the school takes to help students succeed: a ninth period set aside for remedial help and teachers monitoring the halls, both of which are written into the teacher contract.</p>
        <p>The library door was open, the tables were filled with students. In the weight room, where one wall was covered with mirrors, a custodian dropped to his knees upon seeing some chewing gum on the carpet. "Oh, terrible," he mumbled and scraped it clean.</p>
        <p>"There's a misconception that affluent communities don't have problems," Mr. Reine said. "They do. It's just we have a safety net to catch the children, to help them when they fall."</p>
        <p>At both schools, students said that segregation created a gap in their education. "We aren't exposed to people of a different race," Ms. Watkins said.</p>
        <p>At Plainview-Old Bethpage, student officers were discussing several proposals at a recent meeting: establishing an anti-vandalism fund, sectioning off a lounge in the cafeteria, helping the environmental club.</p>
        <p>None of the youths expressed any defeatism until the subject was race. The students said they missed contact with black and Hispanic people, but suggested such exposure should have begun in elementary school.</p>
        <p>"I think it would be a good thing, but I can't see it happening," said Shari Glockner, student vice president. "I feel so sheltered in this community."</p>
