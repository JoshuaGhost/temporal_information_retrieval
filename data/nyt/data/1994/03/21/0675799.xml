        <p>Isolated on a remote field of a vast Russian collective farm called Lenin's Legacy, lies a freakish sliver of the suburban American dream.</p>
        <p>Behind high steel gates, rows of semidetached, pearl gray wooden town houses are artfully arranged along flagstone paths. Each of the 67 prefabricated units is equipped with plush wall-to-wall carpeting, a working fireplace, two-car garage, air-conditioning, microwave oven, washing machine, dryer and cable television. A few yards away, 40 more units are under construction.</p>
        <p>It could be Potomac, Md., or New Canaan, Conn., but in fact, the condominium-style community known as Rosinka is just outside Moscow, 15 miles from the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>And beneath its air of dreamy suburban perfection lies a complicated tale of folly and greed straight out of Gogol, with a dash of John Grisham's legal melodrama. Partners Differ Vastly</p>
        <p>The partners in the joint venture -- a Westport, Conn., real estate development company, Senie Kerschner International Housing, and a former Soviet model collective farm that has fallen on hard times -- are locked in a bitter dispute over who owns the property. Each side accuses the other of deception, greed and theft.</p>
        <p>Such conflicts are not rare in post-Communist Russia, where joint ventures between Western companies and their Russian partners are new and risky, and cultural collisions inevitable. This has especially been true lately; as the Russian economy worsens and the political situation becomes more unstable, most joint ventures are experiencing tension.</p>
        <p>For example, Occidental Petroleum, which has a joint enterprise in Siberia, is tied up in a dispute with its Russian partner over ownership of the oil that is not earmarked for export -- 1.2 million tons in 1993. Because of that, Occidental has recalled all but 6 of its 48 Western experts from the site, and the joint venture, called Vanyoganneft, is not producing any oil for export.</p>
        <p>But the battle over Rosinka has a special flavor. "This case is unusual for the degree of acrimony," said Marc J. Halsema, a lawyer with Steptoe &amp; Johnson, which represents Senie Kerschner and more than 50 other Western companies with joint ventures in Russia. "It's a little unusual to see a joint venture deteriorate this badly."</p>
        <p>The dispute is also unusual because the United States is the leading tenant at Rosinka, renting 40 units for embassy personnel and 9 for employees of the Agency for International Development, at a 5 percent discount on apartments that lease for $4,000 a month. (Executive town houses, with five bedrooms and saunas, go for $7,000, but even at those rents, the community is fully occupied.)</p>
        <p>So far, officials at the United States Embassy have listened sympathetically to American complaints, but continue to pay rent to the Russians. Embassy spokesmen declined to comment on the case.</p>
        <p>"There is a sense here that we don't have the full story from either side," an American diplomat said. "Neither side seems to have behaved according to Hoyle."</p>
        <p>Oleg A. Zakharov, who manages Rosinka as the collective's farm's representative, says the Americans never provided the $2.1 million capital contribution they pledged to the project and instead, using sneaky American accounting ruses, funneled money lent to Rosinka back to their businesses. "They cannot be robbed of something they never owned," he said scornfully.</p>
        <p>Nolan K. Kerschner denied such machinations, and retorted that the Russians took advantage of complex new Russian laws to re-register the joint venture as a Russian company, usurping the Americans' half share and investment, which they calculate at $3.5 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerschner, who has complained to the embassy, the State Department and Congress, is seeking arbitration in Sweden and a Congressional investigation. "Why should the U.S. send all this aid to Russia if they are going to treat American companies like this?" he asked.</p>
        <p>The partnership collapsed as Rosinka appeared to be teetering on the brink of profit. Christopher Senie, the former managing director of Rosinka and the son of Alan Senie, thought that the United States Government was considering a plan last year to buy the units it was leasing, which could have brought Rosinka $10 million. The State Department has denied this.</p>
        <p>Mr. Senie estimated that in five years, if other corporate tenants elected to buy, profits could reach $150 million. "What is being fought over is power and money and access to millions of dollars," he said. Optimism and Vodka</p>
        <p>It all began in a haze of laughter, vodka toasts and vows of eternal friendship in April 5, 1990, when Mr. Kerschner and Alan Senie formed a joint venture with the collective farm, represented by Mr. Zakharov, a suave former K.G.B. officer who looks a little like James Mason.</p>
        <p>Their dream was to build an $88 million development of 478 town houses to pamper Western executives in the kind of gilded ghettos that a Moscow magazine once described as "hygienically sealed hard-currency colonies."</p>
        <p>The Americans promised to provide financing, building materials and know-how. The Russians would find the land and negotiate the bureaucratic maze.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zakharov became the godfather of Christopher Senie's first child. "These people were my best friends in the world," he said. Two years later, Mr. Senie and his family fled Moscow, saying the Russians were trying to intimidate him by turning off his utilities. "They were trying to make my wife and children uncomfortable, to drive the American partner out," he said.</p>
        <p>"Preposterous," Mr. Zakharov replied with a shrug. Nonpayment of Salaries</p>
        <p>Each side has a different version of how the relationship soured, and a competing list of grievances. Mr. Zakharov said the Americans refused to pay the hard-currency salaries and bonuses they had agreed upon, including his own. That was supported by Richard D. Williams, the construction manager, who quit Senie Kerschner and stayed on at Rosinka, working for the Russians.</p>
        <p>"They just didn't have the money to stay on for the long term," Mr. Williams said. "They were using so-called 'fees' out of here to prop up their business at home."</p>
        <p>The relationship was irreparably damaged when Mr. Zakharov brought together a group of Russian businessmen, including himself and Viktor P. Malnev, general director of the farm, to buy some of its shares. The collective farm, under Mr. Malnev's leadership, agreed to sell, but the American partners refused.</p>
        <p>Christopher Senie said Mr. Zakharov was trying to enrich himself and wrest control of the property. Mr. Zakharov said he was only trying to raise money for a farm community in desperate financial straits. The director, Mr. Malnev, declined to be interviewed, saying he was too busy trying to keep the collective farm afloat.</p>
        <p>There were other battles, but both sides agree that the critical issue was the $2.1 million each says the other stole. The Americans, who say they spent $2.1 million in expenses just trying to put together a financing package, hired the Moscow office of the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which reported that the money could be accounted for. A Russian accounting firm drew the opposite conclusion.</p>
        <p>"I'm not saying either side is at fault," said Donald E. Meske, president of Deluxe Homes of Pennsylvania, in Berwick, Pa., which built Rosinka's houses and guaranteed its first construction loan, $1.5 million from the First Eastern Bank in Wilkes-Barre, Pa.</p>
        <p>"I think both sides are at fault," Mr. Meske said, noting that he is still owed the $1.5 million. He said he expected Mr. Zakharov to repay it soon, in which case, he would enter into new deals with him.</p>
        <p>The directors of Senie Kerschner say their last resort is in arbitration in Swedish courts, under the joint-venture agreement, but even there, each side says the other is stalling. Back on the Collective Farm . . .</p>
        <p>Rosinka itself -- serene, well-tended and eerily quiet -- appears unruffled by the fight over its control. "It's a little bit like living in the twilight zone," Richard A. Conn said smilingly of the suburban patch grafted onto Russian soil. Mr. Conn, managing partner of Latham &amp; Watkins's Moscow law office, said the Russian managers and maintenance workers "do a great job."</p>
        <p>"We have no complaints," he said.</p>
        <p>On the collective cattle farm that now owns Rosinka, the commotion over the joint venture is unnoticed. Lenin's statue still presides over the main entrance, faded Communist exhortations to produce are still posted on a giant red billboard, and very little meat or milk is being produced by the 400 workers who are housed, fed and employed there.</p>
        <p>Though the farm is technically independent now and owned by the workers, five-year plans seem alive. None of the workers interviewed had any sense that they owned shares of their farm, or for that matter, a piece of the shining American hamlet on the hill.</p>
        <p>"I've seen it on TV," a ruddy-faced welder named Nikolai remarked. "I've never gone to look at it," he added with a wry smile. "It would only upset me to see those rich houses."</p>
