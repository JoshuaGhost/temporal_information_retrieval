        <p>Construction at two busy intersections near Grand Central Terminal has been a headache for pedestrians, who for months have had to negotiate wooden barriers, plywood ramps and deep puddles in holes in the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>As part of a $30 million improvement project around the terminal, sidewalks and street-light stanchions are being replaced on 43d Street at the corners of Madison and Fifth Avenues. But the project has become yet another casualty of the harsh winter: as on many such sites, the cold has prevented concrete workers from doing their jobs. Now the project, which was to be completed in mid-March, is at least six weeks behind schedule, say officials at the Grand Central Partnership, the business improvement district financing the improvements.</p>

        <p>Construction at two busy intersections near Grand Central Terminal has been a headache for pedestrians, who for months have had to negotiate wooden barriers, plywood ramps and deep puddles in holes in the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>As part of a $30 million improvement project around the terminal, sidewalks and street-light stanchions are being replaced on 43d Street at the corners of Madison and Fifth Avenues. But the project has become yet another casualty of the harsh winter: as on many such sites, the cold has prevented concrete workers from doing their jobs. Now the project, which was to be completed in mid-March, is at least six weeks behind schedule, say officials at the Grand Central Partnership, the business improvement district financing the improvements.</p>
        <p>In mid-November workers tore up the eight corners and erected fences, leaving only a small lane between the barriers and building walls. Three corners have been completed and one is partially completed, but the four remaining are still blocked. Inside the barriers lie stacks of the pinkish-gray Stony Creek marble that will cap the corners.</p>
        <p>Adding to the obstacle course: ramps covering gaps in the sidewalk. During this freeze-and-melt weather, low-lying areas fill with water, or ramps ice over.</p>
        <p>"The wood is always slippery," said Nandram Balrag, who works at Innovation Luggage at 43d Street and Fifth Avenue. "When I walk by there I hold on the mesh netting to keep from falling down."</p>
        <p>His co-worker, Angel Nionakis, complained of the constant logjam. "There are so many people trying to get through such a little space," said Ms. Nionakis. "I've missed two walk signs trying to cross the street."</p>
        <p>Perhaps the project's most vocal opponent is Ved Mehta, a staff writer for The New Yorker, 20 West 43d Street, just off Fifth. Mr. Mehta, who is blind, has been complaining to the partnership for months, he says, that he has difficulty getting around the construction, largely because, he contends, ramps and fences have not been maintained.</p>
        <p>"I've been using 43d Street since 1961," Mr. Mehta said. "I've been here for the construction of the Princeton Club and the renovation of the Century Club, and nothing has been as bad as this."</p>
        <p>Arthur Rosenblatt, in charge of capital programs for the partnership, says they maintain the site as well as they can in inclement weather; no citations for safety violation have been issued.</p>
        <p>Something of a feud has developed between Mr. Mehta and Mr. Rosenblatt, both of whom are members of the Century, a social club mostly of artists and writers situated on a block known as Clubhouse Row because of its many social and university clubs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta said he has nearly slipped twice; Bernard Moreau, the manager of the Century, said he did slip on an icy ramp in January but didn't blame the partnership.</p>
        <p>Generally, the temperature has been too cold for concrete to set and be waterproofed, Mr. Rosenblatt said. "This has been a terrible tragedy for us," he added. "We are doing everything we can." RANDY KENNEDY  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MIDTOWN  Correction:  March 13, 1994, Sunday</p>
        <p>An article in the Neighborhood Report last Sunday about the Grand Central Partnership's decision to suspend a homeless-outreach program referred incorrectly to financing arrangements. The New York Community Trust, a foundation, had agreed to provide $45,000 of the cost; it made no commitment to raise additional funds.</p>
