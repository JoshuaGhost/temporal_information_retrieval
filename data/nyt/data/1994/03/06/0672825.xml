        <p>Bernard W. Nussbaum, the White House counsel, reluctantly submitted his resignation today in an effort to set aside mounting questions over his repeated contacts with Federal officials who are investigating President and Mrs. Clinton's ties to a failed Arkansas savings and loan.</p>

        <p>Bernard W. Nussbaum, the White House counsel, reluctantly submitted his resignation today in an effort to set aside mounting questions over his repeated contacts with Federal officials who are investigating President and Mrs. Clinton's ties to a failed Arkansas savings and loan.</p>
        <p>The move came a day after 10 White House and Treasury Department officials were subpoenaed by the grand jury that is investigating whether there was any improper financial relationship between the failed thrift, Madison Guaranty, and the Whitewater Development Company, a real estate venture in Arkansas in which the Clintons were partners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nussbaum's departure, which is effective on April 5, and the subpoenas brought by the special prosecutor, Robert B. Fiske Jr., shifted the focus from business dealings in Arkansas to the behavior of top Administration officials since the investigation began. The actions left White House officials reeling, and the mood in their offices today ranged from bitter to fatalistic. Elusive Goal</p>
        <p>In forcing Mr. Nussbaum's resignation, White House aides hoped to take another step toward the goal that has eluded them for months: to isolate the Whitewater matter and keep it from further tarnishing the President. But no one would hazard a guess today that this had been accomplished.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nussbaum defended his actions in a four-paragraph letter delivered to President Clinton late this morning, maintaining that as the President's lawyer he had run the counsel's office "in an absolutely legal and ethical manner."</p>
        <p>"Unfortunately, as a result of controversy generated by those who do not understand, nor wish to understand, the role and obligations of a lawyer, even one acting as White House counsel, I now believe I can best serve you by returning to private life," Mr. Nussbaum wrote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nussbaum's letter was drafted after he met with Mr. Clinton in the Oval Office for more than an hour on Friday evening. Mr. Clinton, who had told Mr. Nussbaum during that conversation that he could no longer stay on, immediately accepted the resignation today with what he said was "deep regret." 'Serving Is Hard'</p>
        <p>"It has been said that the best a man can give is his living spirit to a service that is not easy," Mr. Clinton wrote in the response. "And we have worked together in Washington at a time when serving is hard."</p>
        <p>Mr. Nussbaum's departure, to be delayed for a month so that the White House chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty 3d, can find and hire a successor, comes at a particularly turbulent time in the White House, which is trying to sell a health care plan that appears to be losing public support.</p>
        <p>The 57-year-old Mr. Nussbaum continued to work in his office in a jacket and tie this afternoon as Mr. Clinton and his family left to spend the rest of the weekend at Camp David, Md.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nussbaum, who was the senior lawyer on the Senate Watergate committee that laid out the case for impeaching President Richard M. Nixon, met Mrs. Clinton when she was a junior member of the committee's staff. They remained especially close, and in his letter of resignation he made a special mention of the value he attached to their friendship.</p>
        <p>But some officials said that his loyalty to the Clintons had become a liability as he appeared to step in repeatedly to shield the President and the First Lady from embarrassment on matters involving the Federal inquiry.</p>
        <p>Along with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Nussbaum resisted appointing a special counsel to look into the Whitewater matter, creating a delay that gave Congressional Democrats pause and Republicans fodder to assert that a cover-up was under way. Republican Skepticism</p>
        <p>Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, issued a statement today calling it "inconceivable" that President Clinton and his wife were unaware that Mr. Nussbaum had met with Treasury officials to discuss the case.</p>
        <p>"These White House staffers are just scapegoats," the Senator said. "They work for the President, and the President is responsible for his staff."</p>
        <p>Mr. Nussbaum was also involved in several other embarrassing incidents during the Clintons' first year, including the fitful search for an Attorney General, the decision to drop the nomination of Lani Guinier to the Justice Department's chief civil rights post, the dismissals of several employees in the White House travel office and the cataloguing and hasty removal of papers from the office of his deputy, Vincent W. Foster Jr., who died last July in an apparent suicide.</p>
        <p>In issuing the subpoenas, Mr. Fiske also asked the White House to produce documents relating to the case.</p>
        <p>There was no indication that the subpoenas were issued for anything other than information-gathering purposes, and Joel Klein, the White House deputy counsel, immediately instructed the White House staff, janitors and technicians not to destroy information and documents in files, computers, waste baskets and burn bags. Discussions Acknowledged</p>
        <p>The legal action came after Mr. Nussbaum, Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert C. Altman and other officials acknowledged that they had discussed the Federal investigation of Madison Guaranty, the Arkansas-based savings and loan that was headed by James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater company. Mr. Altman is the acting head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Government agency that is charged with disposing of failed thrifts and that is conducting the investigation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nussbaum attended each of three meetings that have drawn Mr. Fiske's attention. He held one conversation with Jean Hanson, the lawyer for the Treasury Department, in early October, about a week before the Resolution Trust Corporation asked the Justice Department to investigate the failure of Madison. Mr. Nussbaum also participated in a meeting with several other senior aides in which Mr. Altman discussed the status of the Resolution Trust investigation, and he met with press officials who were presenting reporters' questions.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Nussbaum, only Ms. Hanson took part in all three of the sessions. The two were the only participants in what White House officials have described as the most troublesome encounter, on Sept. 29. In that meeting, Ms. Hanson told Mr. Nussbaum that the Clintons would be mentioned as possible beneficiaries of illegal actions in the Resolution Trust Corporation's request for a Justice Department investigation of Madison. Aides Subpoenaed</p>
        <p>The six White House aides subpoenaed to testify were Mr. Nussbaum; Bruce Lindsey, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton; Harold M. Ickes, the deputy chief of staff; Mark D. Gearan, the communications director; Maggie Williams, the chief of staff to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Lisa Caputo, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary.</p>
        <p>At the Treasury Department, Mr. Altman, Ms. Hanson and Josh Steiner, chief of staff to Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, were subpoenaed, along with Jack DeVore, who was previously Mr. Bentsen's chief spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Altman this week released a letter he wrote on Thursday to Senator Donald W. Riegle, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, in which he said that an ethics officer in the Treasury Department had said in advance that such a meeting would be "no problem."</p>
        <p>After disclosing the meeting in testimony to Congress late last month, Mr. Altman said he would recuse himself from future participation in the matter. White House and Treasury Department officials said today that there had been some White House unhappiness about Mr. Altman's decision to recuse himself but that no one had directly suggested to him that he change his mind.</p>
        <p>Others, however, including Vice President Al Gore, supported Mr. Altman's decision to recuse himself. Some officials had also urged White House strategists to acknowledge quickly the impropriety of the meetings and state that they would not recur. White House Intransigence</p>
        <p>But White House spokesmen did not reverse themselves and admit that such meetings could be considered improper until Republicans, and some Democrats, in Congress began to complain that the exchanges of information were inappropriate.</p>
        <p>The White House intransigence swung the spotlight back to Mr. Nussbaum from Mr. Altman and, officials said, it finally became inevitable that Mr. Nussbaum, who had emerged as the common denominator in several White House embarrassments, would have to resign.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Nussbaum resisted previous calls for his resignation, and in the exchange of letters today both he and Mr. Clinton called attention to the White House counsel's achievements, including the successful appointments of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Attorney General Janet Reno and Louis J. Freeh, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>White House officials said that the Government would not provide lawyers for the staff members who have been subpoenaed, and it remained unclear how many of them would have to testify in person before the grand jury and where that would occur.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, some staff members were furious at having been drawn into a mess that they had worked so hard to set aside and at a time when they were trying to focus on legislative matters.</p>
        <p>"It's not because anybody did anything wrong," said one White House official. "I don't think anybody did anything wrong. It's just the idea that you have to call home and explain it."</p>
        <p>THE WHITEWATER INQUIRY  Correction:  March 8, 1994, Tuesday</p>
        <p>An article on Sunday about the resignation of Bernard W. Nussbaum as White House counsel misidentified the Congressional committee on which both he and Hillary Rodham Clinton were staff lawyers. It was the House Judiciary Committee, which was considering the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon, not the Senate Watergate committee.</p>
