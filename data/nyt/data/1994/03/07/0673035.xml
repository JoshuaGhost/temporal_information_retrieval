        <p>At Tolstoy's vast country estate, Yasnaya Polyana, everything is just as it was when the great writer died. His pen lies on his writing table. The simple peasant blouse he always wore hangs from a peg in his bedroom. His beloved birch-lined drive still thrives.</p>
        <p>And so does the bitter fighting that divided Tolstoy's household during his last, famously unhappy years.</p>
        <p>Now a museum and nature preserve, the 1,100-acre sylvan retreat where Tolstoy wrote "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina" is caught between the old Communist way of doing business and the uncharted new.</p>
        <p>And a little like Tolstoy's wife, Sofiya, who competed with her husband's fanatical disciple, Vladimir G. Chertkov, over how Yasnaya Polyana should be run, Tolstoy's descendants are battling with powerful local authorities for control of the estate -- and, occasionally, with each other.  And curiously, two different men, one a Tolstoy, the other an appointee of the former local Communist Party, both claim the title of estate director.</p>
        <p>Critical issues that divide the Russian nation are being played out here in miniature: Should state-owned property be developed privately? Can commercial development be controlled? What can be done to protect the environment? And who decides such matters, local authorities or the state? Vodka as 'Blasphemy'</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most troubling question involves the sudden appearance of Tolstoy kitsch.</p>
        <p>"Tolstoj," a German-made brand of vodka that carries the writer's portrait and his dates of birth and death on the label, is on sale for 3,300 rubles a bottle ($2) at the gate of the writer's estate, the sort of cheesy Graceland tribute that is still rare in Russia. "This is neither trivial nor funny," Vladimir I. Tolstoy, 31, a great-grandnephew of the writer, said sternly. "It is blasphemy." Mr. Tolstoy said the family planned to sue the manufacturer.</p>
        <p>A slender, earnest young man who works at the Ministry of Culture in Moscow, Mr. Tolstoy said he had been chosen by the far-flung Tolstoy clan to run Yasnaya Polyana, which means Clear Glade and lies about 200 miles south of Moscow. He said his appointment, supported in Moscow, is being blocked by power-hungry local politicians, cronies of the actual director, Andrei I. Tyapkin.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyapkin, who was appointed seven years ago, said the Tolstoy family had no say in the matter because Yasnaya Polyana belongs to the Government. "I was told to keep working, and not worry," he said with a prim smile.</p>
        <p>The issue of who should head the institution in the post-Communist era has been complicated by a recent change in the museum's status. Last November, President Boris N. Yeltsin named several famous landmarks, including the Hermitage museum and Tolstoy's country home, as national treasures entitled to special protection and financing by the national Government.</p>
        <p>The new special status means that Yasnaya Polyana, which had been under the joint jurisdiction of local and state governments, will become the responsibility of Moscow, a change that requires new bylaws and endless red tape. Both Mr. Tyapkin and Mr. Tolstoy have written their own proposals on how they would reorganize the institution once the Government assumes control. Two Draft Proposals</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyapkin's first draft proposal was rejected by experts in the Ministry of Culture. Mr. Tolstoy, who was given a two-year contract to work at the Ministry of Culture on the estate's bylaws, said his would probably be accepted.</p>
        <p>But the Minister of Culture, Yevgeny Y. Sidorov, who is himself a member of Parliament from the Tula area, did not give Mr. Tolstoy a ringing endorsement. "Just because someone belongs to a great family is not a guarantee of brilliant administrative talent," Mr. Sidorov said drily. He said that if the institution's new status required a new director, he would consider offering Mr. Tolstoy a year in the job to prove himself, but that first he would need to study museum management.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Tyapkin is the director," Mr. Sidorov added. "And he can't be fired by whim of the Tolstoy family."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tolstoy charges that under current management, pollution from a gigantic nearby chemical plant has killed some of the trees in the orchards and caused autumn leaves to fall in July. He also complains that the estate has been neglected while neighboring plots on protected land were used to build private dachas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyapkin and local officials deny mishandling the real estate, but concede the pollution, saying they too deplore the damage. The regional administrator, Nikolai V. Sevryugin, like Mr. Tyapkin, a product of the local Communist machine (he resigned from the party around the same time as Mr. Yeltsin), said that emissions had been significantly reduced in the last two years.</p>
        <p>"It has gone from near-death to just really bad," Mr. Tolstoy complained. "If I were director, I couldn't stop it overnight but I would prevent new polluting." To Regain Control</p>
        <p>Mr. Tolstoy wants the entire extended Tolstoy clan -- and there are some 300 living descendants -- to band together in a new foundation and regain administrative control of the estate, which Tolstoy's widow donated to the Russian people, with himself in charge. He would be the first relative to administer Yasnaya Polyana since the writer's daughter, Sofiya, died in 1956.</p>
        <p>"I am anticipating a struggle at the top," he said, "between the regional powers-that-be and the artists and intellectuals who think that the return to Yasnaya Polyana of the Tolstoy family is the logical step."</p>
        <p>Of course, not all Tolstoy families are alike.</p>
        <p>In Paris, 83-year-old Serge M. Tolstoy, the last surviving grandson of Tolstoy, said he had no complaints with the current director, but grumbled about his great-grandnephew Vladimir's efforts to take over the post. Serge Tolstoy and his wife, Colette, agitated some relatives three years ago by offering to pay for the construction, with some help from private developers, of a cultural center and hotel complex to serve tourists. Mr. Tyapkin favored the project and helped select a site. Vladimir Tolstoy and others oppose it.</p>
        <p>Vladimir Tolstoy said he favored the building of a hotel and cultural center someday, but only after Mr. Tyapkin left his post. He said he fought to table his Parisian relative's proposal because it would only embolden Mr. Tyapkin to broker development deals of his own. "If a Tolstoy sponsors a hotel," he said, "Tyapkin would probably think he can put up a casino." 'A Natural Desire'</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyapkin, in turn, hinted that some Tolstoy family members might be trying to privatize the estate, out of what he called, "a natural desire to regain what was lost." And with a sly smile, he suggested that venality could run in the family. "Don't forget," he said, "after his death, some of Tolstoy's sons tried to sell Yasnaya Polyana to the Americans for $1 million."</p>
        <p>He stoutly denied charges that he allowed the construction of private dachas on the protected territory surrounding the estate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sevryugin, the regional administrator who helped appoint Mr. Tyapkin, defended him this way: "It wasn't him; it was a few local district leaders. We have looked into it; all such construction has stopped." He added quickly, "Actually, it never happened."</p>
        <p>In this milieu Tolstoy's life and work are like the Bible: in any dispute, each side cites a different fragment from Tolstoy's work or life to justify its position.</p>
        <p>Vladimir Tolstoy said that the sale of Tolstoj vodka was particularly obscene because the writer "crusaded against drunkenness." Mr. Tyapkin argued: "Tolstoy was never an ascetic. He opened three wineries here."</p>
        <p>(They are both slightly wrong, said Berta M. Shumova, deputy director of research at the Tolstoy museum in Moscow. Mrs. Shumova explained that Tolstoy discussed starting a winery with local farmers, but abandoned the idea while writing "War and Peace." He did not lead a temperance movement in his old age, but did write a pamphlet against drunkenness in 1887.) Same Basic Goals</p>
        <p>Oddly, given the jousting over who should run the institution, both sides seem to share the same basic goals: preserving the estate, protecting its environment and keeping Tolstoy's spirit alive.</p>
        <p>And no one is closer to Tolstoy's spirit than the estate's retired caretaker, Nikolai P. Puzin, 83.</p>
        <p>A dedicated family biographer who keeps a record of all 280 Tolstoy descendants and corresponds with most, Mr. Puzin strolled through the property he lovingly maintained for 50 years and confessed he was tired of the infighting. "I have lived through many directors," he said. "It's all God's will in any case, because Yasnaya Polyana will always be a mecca for all the people of the world."</p>
        <p>But in perhaps the ultimate example that no man is a hero to his valet, Mr. Puzin confessed that he spent his holidays on the nearby estate of the writer Ivan Turgenev. (Mr. Puzin's godmother was the housekeeper of the Turgenev estate, which is also now a museum.) Turgenev and Tolstoy had a good-natured rivalry over whose country seat was better. "I serve Tolstoy," Mr. Puzin explained, "But I prefer Turgenev's home."</p>
