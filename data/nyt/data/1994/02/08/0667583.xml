        <p>A young team, emerging from the Culbertson Club, at 24 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, has already made a notable mark on the current New York season.</p>
        <p>Ernie Campbell of Fresh Meadows, Queens; Anne Mittman, John Ramos and Matthew Connor, all of Manhattan; Charles Whitney of Newark and Sanjiv Gupta of Roselle Park, N.J., whose average age is well under 30, have won three straight matches in the Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship. Their victims, including bunches of players with significant national and international records, were the second-seeded team headed by Michael Kamil, the 15th-seeded team led by Dorothy Truscott and the seventh-seeded team headed by David Rosenberg.</p>
        <p>On the diagramed deal from the Charity Pairs in the New York Regional Championships at New Year's, Ramos as South landed in four spades and made a remarkable number of tricks. West led the diamond ace and shifted to a heart. South put up the ace, ruffed a diamond and cashed the ace and king of spades. He ruffed another diamond, returned to dummy with a club lead and ruffed one more diamond with his last trump.</p>
        <p>[ DIAGRAM ]</p>
        <p>Now Ramos was able to cash three club tricks, discard dummy's remaining heart and ruff a heart. He had made an improbable overtrick and collected all the match points.</p>
