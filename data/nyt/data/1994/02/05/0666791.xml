        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for "China Becomes Theme Park, but Cultural Debate Remains Real" (news article, Jan. 9), on the opening of the Splendid China theme park at Kissimmee, Fla. I wish to set the record straight on the spelling of my name and other points.</p>
        <p>I was surprised by your heavy emphasis on politics, since this is strictly a cultural and tourism park. The object of China Travel Service (Holdings) Hong Kong Ltd. was to introduce Americans to Chinese culture and tourist attractions, and to promote tourism and cultural exchange.</p>
        <p>There are many marvels to be seen in China, including the Great Wall, the terra cotta warriors and, yes, the Potala Palace in Lhasa. Thus, it was only natural to recreate these in miniature at the park. Tibet, to my best knowledge, became part of China during the Tang Dynasty between A.D. 618 and 907, 1,000 years ago!</p>
        <p>The performers at the park are from a variety of ethnic groups, so we could provide visitors with authentic entertainment from China. You imply that these performers may be at the park involuntarily. On the contrary, they have signed contracts to be in America and are happy to have the opportunity to perform and experience life in Central Florida.</p>
        <p>Some people you quote suggest that children should be discouraged from visiting the park for political reasons. Why deprive children of a learning experience in the name of politics?</p>
        <p>You quote John Ackerly, director of the International Campaign for Tibet, saying that Americans support the Chinese Government by visiting the park. Many goods purchased by Americans are made in China. Hundreds of American companies have invested in China. Should Americans stop buying Chinese goods and investing in China? The park has given jobs to the Americans building and running it.  PAN XINLIANG  Managing Director, China Travel Service (U.S.A.) San Francisco, Jan. 24, 1994</p>
