        <p>The pickings are slim at the Manhattan Class Company's sixth annual Class One-Acts festival.</p>
        <p>Of the four offerings on the bill, only "Good as New," written and directed by Peter Hedges, has any sticking power. The others are piffle. It wouldn't take a strong wind to blow them over; someone inadvertently opening a door backstage during the performance could probably do it.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Hedges's work is slight. A 16-year-old daughter (Margaret Welsh) is driving her middle-aged mother (Jenny O'Hara) home from the hospital. The mother has just had her face lifted and is still bruised and bandaged. If the daughter is unsure at the wheel, she has already developed some firm feminist opinions and considers the operation a deplorable instance of "the unnecessary mutilation of women."</p>
        <p>The mother, whose marriage has gone stale, tries to explain that she had the operation to shore up her sagging dignity as much as her falling features. But the daughter is a little petulant and doesn't want to understand. And that's pretty much it.</p>
        <p>"Good as New" is a generation-gap drama in a nutshell (or in the front seat of an automobile). However, Mr. Hedges, the author of the novel and screenplay for the current film "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," writes dialogue that is humorous and resonant, and the actresses are excellent. While you see the characters only for a brief period as they tootle down the highway, you end up with a real sense of where they've been in their lives and where they're headed.</p>
        <p>The other three plays are stillborn. Annie Evans's "I Can't Stop Thinking Today" is a trite monologue about a woman (Allison Janney) who has an apocalyptic imagination. Although there's a good reason she pictures exploding blimps in the sky and cancer in passing pedestrians, you won't be very surprised when she gets around to spilling it.</p>
        <p>In "The Amazon's Voice," the playwright Allan Heinberg introduces us to a cartoonist (Tim Blake Nelson), who has been asked to reconceive the character of Wonder Woman for today's audience. To that end, he summons up memories of his mother (Ellen Parker), a dynamo who vanished on her 45th birthday. In a series of flashbacks, we meet the woman, a doctor's wife, who decides to become a doctor herself, divorces her cheating husband, takes up with another man, marries him, suffers his abuse and somehow remains incredibly energetic through it all.</p>
        <p>Apparently the playwright is paying tribute to the indomitable woman, a combination of Auntie Mame and Florence Henderson. Ms. Parker is certainly blindingly bright in the role. But the piece is a jumble, and you know you're in trouble when the son admits he is an unfulfilled homosexual and the mother tries to buck up his spirits by boasting about his "perfect penis."</p>
        <p>As for Robert Shaffron's "Endless Air, Endless Water," it is a dopey sketch about two astronauts on a mission to the moon, who reveal to a television audience of millions that they are in love. As they slip beyond gravity's pull, the actors (Bill Christ and Scott Paetty) are hoisted off their feet by wires and dangle helplessly in space. Neither, however, is clown enough to rise above the hoary material, and Jimmy Bohr's direction offers no assistance.</p>
        <p>Class One-Acts, which runs through March 12, invites one of two conclusions. Nobody talented is writing plays these days. Or the good stuff just hasn't found its way to the Manhattan Class Company. I lean toward the latter. Class One-Acts Festival  Four one-act plays. Sets by Rob Odorisio; lighting by Stewart Wagner; costumes by Judy Jerald Sackheim; sound by John Kilgore; production supervisors, Laura Kravets Gautier and Ira Mont. Presented by Manhattan Class Company, Robert LuPone and Bernard Telsey, executive directors. At 120 West 28th Street, Chelsea. I CAN'T STOP THINKING TODAY, by Annie Evans, directed by Max Mayer. With Allison Janney. THE AMAZON'S VOICE, by Allan Heinberg, directed by Melia Bensussen. With Tim Blake Nelson and Ellen Parker. ENDLESS AIR, ENDLESS WATER, by Robert Shaffron, directed by Jimmy Bohr. With Bill Christ, Scott Paetty, Bill Timoney and Penny Ejke. GOOD AS NEW, written and directed by Peter Hedges. With Jenny O'Hara and Margaret Welsh.</p>
