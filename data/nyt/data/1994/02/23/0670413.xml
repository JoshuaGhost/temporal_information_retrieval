        <p>The United States and Europe appeared headed toward another confrontation over the film industry after an unusually sharp dispute broke out today between the European Union and United International Pictures, a film-distribution company owned by three big Hollywood studios.</p>

        <p>The United States and Europe appeared headed toward another confrontation over the film industry after an unusually sharp dispute broke out today between the European Union and United International Pictures, a film-distribution company owned by three big Hollywood studios.</p>
        <p>Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the European commissioner in charge of audio-visual issues, told reporters in Brussels that United International should not receive an extension of an antitrust waiver granted in 1989 that allows the three studios -- Paramount, Universal and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer -- to distribute films to theaters in Europe through a single organization.</p>
        <p>He said the company had acted in a way that impeded competition, for example, by forcing theaters to take a package of less popular movies in order to be able to show a big hit like Universal's "Jurassic Park."</p>
        <p>United International, based in London, denied the assertion and challenged Mr. Deus Pinheiro to produce evidence to back up his statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deus Pinheiro said he was not trying to limit distribution of American-made movies. But he said that United International, one of the two largest American film distributors in Europe, might be impeding growth in European films.</p>
        <p>He said he would recommend to the European Commission, the bloc's policy-making body, that it revoke the antitrust waiver, which formally expired last year, when it takes up the issue this summer. "What I want in this expanding market is more room for European works and fairer distribution," he said.</p>
        <p>If the waiver is revoked, it could jeopardize United International's existence and greatly increase the cost to the three studios of distributing their movies in Europe. It threatens to become another flashpoint in European-American trade relations, which are still rocky after repeated clashes last year over cultural trade issues during the negotiations for a new world accord under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.</p>
        <p>Responding to Mr. Deus Pinheiro, Brian F. Reilly, United International's senior vice president and general counsel, said, "We are very disturbed that Commissioner Pinheiro should have publicly expressed these negative opinions about U.I.P. when neither he nor his staff have approached us for facts or comment."</p>
        <p>He called Mr. Deus Pinheiro's assertion that U.I.P. controlled 80 percent of film distribution in Europe "grossly misinformed" and said his company's share of the European film market had been running at 15 to 20 percent for several years.</p>
        <p>Last year, he said, United International was most likely beaten out as the largest of the American distributors in Europe by Warner Brothers, although complete figures are not yet available. The Walt Disney Company, the 20th Century Fox Film Corporation and Columbia Pictures also compete in Europe.</p>
        <p>United International has struggled somewhat because of the difficulties of its parent companies. MGM has been trying to remain afloat for years. Paramount Pictures, one of the prizes won recently by Viacom in the takeover battle for Paramount Communications, has had a dismal record for the last few years. Despite the great success of "Jurassic Park," Universal has not produced many movies that have done well in Europe.  COMPANY NEWS</p>
