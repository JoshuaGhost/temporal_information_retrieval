        <p>A day after New York State's highest court ordered New York City to comply with its own 1989 recycling law, a senior official in the Giuliani administration said the Mayor might seek to renegotiate the law's timetables with the City Council because of the costs of complying with the statute.</p>
        <p>Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers suggested that the recycling goals set forth in the law were no longer affordable given the fact that the law was passed "when the finances of the city were nicer."</p>
        <p>He said the administration wanted to talk to Council leaders to see if it were possible to change the law, which originally called for the city to be collecting 4,250 tons of recyclable material a day by this April, or about 25 percent of the city's total waste. The city currently is collecting about 15 percent, said Sanitation Commissioner Emily Lloyd. 'Got to Get Realistic'</p>
        <p>"We've got to get realistic about things," Mr. Powers said at a breakfast forum with business executives. "We set goals with certain economics in mind. We no longer have those economics. So we've got to revisit those goals. The Mayor's in favor of recycling. He wants to achieve it. He wants to achieve it as fast as we can. But he also has to put a lot of services out there for the people of the city with not enough money to do it."</p>
        <p>But City Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone yesterday hailed the ruling by the State Court of Appeals and said the money could be found for recycling. "The job of the executive branch now is to comply with the recycling law," he said. "If it can't comply with the law, it has to come back and tell us why."</p>
        <p>The 1989 law, signed by Mayor Edward I. Koch, requires the city gradually to increase the amount of residential garbage that is recycled. But as the recession took hold, Mayor David N. Dinkins imposed budget cuts that delayed the expansion of the recycling program.</p>
        <p>The Court of Appeals found in a ruling on Tuesday that the recycling measures in the law are mandatory and not goals that could be delayed by fiscal constraints as the Dinkins administration had argued. The ruling sent the Giuliani administration and the plainfiffs -- the Natural Resources Defense Council and two City Council members -- back to court to draw up a new schedule for meeting the recycling requirements.</p>
