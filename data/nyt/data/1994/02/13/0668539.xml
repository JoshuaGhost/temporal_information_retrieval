        <p>In New York City, Le Marquis is unique: part single-room-occupancy hotel, part halfway house for prisoners sentenced for nonviolent crimes.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, the marriage has worked. Permanent residents -- some there for more than four decades -- generally agree conditions are better than in the mid-1980's, when the hotel housed welfare families. They do complain about noise and an overcrowded elevator, but the prisoners attend to separate lives, and enforced house rules forbid them from communicating with neighbors.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, tensions are running high at Le Marquis, 12 East 31st Street, whose most famous recent occupant was Leona Helmsley. At issue are tenant fears that they are being edged out by the Marquis's management company, Esmor Correctional Services, which has tried to increase the number of rooms allotted for prisoners.</p>
        <p>At least two tenants, Carlos Ramires and Steven Gonzales, say that Esmor has offered them less expensive accommodations elsewhere. And Joan Piker, who heads a group set up by Community Board 5 to monitor the hotel, says Esmor has moved prisoners and prison furniture into rooms reserved for residents.</p>
        <p>The problems surfaced on Jan. 13, when James Slattery, president of Esmor, appeared at a community board meeting with a request for 10 additional rooms for prisoners. Saying that he had the support of 80 percent of the tenants, he presented two pages of signatures. Tenants denied having ever seen the petition but recalled signing a piece of paper for holiday gift baskets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slattery eventually apologized and withdrew his request.</p>
        <p>"That was when we formed our tenants association," said Mr. Gonzales, a security guard who pays $350 for a room at Le Marquis.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Fish, the community board chairman, wrote to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, protesting what he called "a serious misrepresentation and possible fraud." The matter has been referred to the Office of Internal Affairs for "possible investigation," the agency says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slattery did not return repeated calls.</p>
        <p>Under a written agreement with the community board in 1990, Esmor took over management of Le Marquis on condition that 75 of the 150 rooms be reserved for tenants. The Long Island-based company, which also operates halfway houses in several other states, went public on Feb. 2 with a $6 million stock offering.</p>
        <p>"Halfway-house rooms are big business and pay far more than rent-stabilized rooms," said Karen Stamm, lawyer with MFY East Side S.R.O. Legal Services Project. She said there were about 60 tenants paying $100 to $600 a month.</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Prisons pays $72 to $75 a day for each of its 108 Marquis prisoners, said Merle Reams, community corrections manager. In addition, the state has a $3.8 million contract with Esmor for 150 beds -- 25 at Le Marquis and 125 at a halfway house in Brooklyn. The Esmor program includes food, counseling, vocational assistance and job placement.</p>
        <p>At a tenants meeting last week, a list of demands was drafted to be presented to Esmor. Among them were designating which rooms prisoners can occupy and consolidating them in specific areas. (Tenants now share floors with prisoners.)</p>
        <p>June Kane, a retired secretary, came to Le Marquis in 1949, when "it was a real hotel with maid service, clean towels daily, a restaurant bar and chairs and sofas in the lobby." Ms. Kane, who pays $481 a month, said, "It's not right to have prisoners and tenants on the same floor." MARVINE HOWE RULES FOR HALFWAY HOUSE LIVING</p>
        <p>From "Le Marquis Community Corrections Center Handbook":</p>
        <p>Bathe at least once a day.</p>
        <p>Be subject to pat shakes as well as strip searches.</p>
        <p>Be subject to random urinalysis and breath analyzer tests.</p>
        <p>Be in the room for 9:15 P.M. head count and 11 P.M. curfew.</p>
        <p>Submit packages for inspection.</p>
        <p>Do not receive phone calls, and limit outgoing calls to 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Do not holler, whistle or communicate with passers-by or neighbors.</p>
        <p>Do not leave the center without approval of an on-duty employee.</p>
        <p>Participate in a personalized counseling program.</p>
        <p>Seek full-time employment with help from the center.</p>
        <p>Pay the center 25 percent of weekly gross income from employment.  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: MURRAY HILL</p>
