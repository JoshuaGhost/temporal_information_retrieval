        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Now that President Clinton is embarked on health reforms, it is to be hoped a long-overdue reciprocity for the free emergency health treatment given United States citizens visiting Britain will not escape his attention.</p>
        <p>For the first 38 years of Britain's National Health Service after its inception in 1948, American visitors falling ill while in this country were given, absolutely free of any charge, the same medical care as Britons, whether costly surgery, long stay hospitalization or local doctor service was required. There were no limits, and it applied to all foreign nationals even though the majority of the world's countries -- like the United States -- then, as now, refused to offer a reciprocal agreement.</p>
        <p>However, by 1983 the National Health Service was in severe financial difficulties, and the newly re-elected Thatcher Government was forced to revise the rules, including those pertaining to foreign emergency use. Those revisions are still in force and continue to give full use of the National Health Service free to foreign visitors but for limited, rather than open ended, periods.</p>
        <p>All in all, Britain's record of medical hospitality compares nobly with that shown to Britons by the United States, where the rule seems, as ever, to be put your money down, or fall down. Such a policy sits strangely on the shoulders of a nation so justly famed for its generosity to others.</p>
        <p>It is surely high time the United States put an end to this indefensible attitude by which it receives our services for nothing and gives us nothing in return. LAURENCE LAIGHT  Wadebridge, England, Feb. 4, 1994</p>
