        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I've never before heard the anecdote recounted by Martin Filler in his article on Robert Morris  [ " 'Taking the Temperature of His Own Ideas,' " Jan. 23 ]  that when told of the death of Marcel Duchamp, Picasso said, simply, "He was wrong." Mr. Filler and Mr. Morris understand this as a put-down of Duchamp's art, and perhaps it was also that, but it sounds like a response to a famous mot of Duchamp's, which is inscribed on his tombstone: "D'ailleurs c'est toujours les autres qui meurent" -- "Besides, it's always the others who die."
