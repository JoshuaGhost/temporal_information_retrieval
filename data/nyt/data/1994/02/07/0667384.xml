        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is disheartening to see intelligent political figures like President Bill Clinton and New York's Gov. Mario M. Cuomo embracing with shameless enthusiasm the "three strikes and you're out" proposal.</p>
        <p>Despite the broad public appeal of it, these leaders must surely realize that locking up three-time violent offenders for life would do nothing to control crime, would wreak havoc on our prison systems and would result in squandering huge amounts of government resources.</p>
        <p>In New York State, such a proposal would affect 300 offenders a year. In the short term it would have no effect on crime or prisons because these people will be incarcerated under existing laws anyway. But the long-term consequences would be calamitous. In 20 years, for example, New York would have in custody 6,000 people who would have to stay confined, at state expense, not only past, say, 40 years old, by which time virtually all of them will have aged out of any inclinations to additional violence, but also for their entire lives.</p>
        <p>Prison officials would be charged with running geriatric institutions, instead of correctional facilities, for thousands of inmates no longer dangerous to public safety, and taxpayers would be picking up the tab involving billions of dollars in operating and construction costs.</p>
        <p>So, of course, less money would be available to support measures that actually stand a chance of reducing crime, ranging from drug rehabilitation and community policing to economic development programs. It should also be noted that most jurisdictions already have on their books mandatory sentencing statutes that will send three-time felony losers away for a long time.</p>
        <p>"Three strikes and you're out" represents extension of a policy that has proved a failure: prison expansion. Since 1973, New York's prison population has grown more than 500 percent, from 12,500 inmates to 64,500 today. But can anyone argue that the streets are safer, or that drug abuse and violence are less a threat to the quality of our lives?</p>
        <p>It is time for the American public to see past the pandering of political leaders and understand that tough-sounding baseball metaphors are no substitute for smart, effective anti-crime policies. ROBERT GANGI  Executive Director, Correctional Assn. of New York New York, Jan. 28, 1994</p>
