        <p>The new Yankee Bob Ojeda needed to ask where the clubhouse was, Jim Abbott graciously signed autographs and chatted with the few fans in attendance and Manager Buck Showalter actually left Fort Lauderdale Stadium before it turned dark.

        <p>Since players could simply telephone the Yankees to inform them that they had arrived, and since the first organized workout is not until Thursday at 10 A.M., few ventured onto the field or into the batting cages. Abbott and Bob Wickman graced the outfield grass by running and tossing a baseball, Mike Gallego whacked baseballs and Matt Nokes lifted weights. Ho-hum.</p>

        <p>The new Yankee Bob Ojeda needed to ask where the clubhouse was, Jim Abbott graciously signed autographs and chatted with the few fans in attendance and Manager Buck Showalter actually left Fort Lauderdale Stadium before it turned dark. Pitchers and catchers trickled into camp today and the pace was relaxing, even restful.</p>
        <p>Since players could simply telephone the Yankees to inform them that they had arrived, and since the first organized workout is not until Thursday at 10 A.M., few ventured onto the field or into the batting cages. Abbott and Bob Wickman graced the outfield grass by running and tossing a baseball, Mike Gallego whacked baseballs and Matt Nokes lifted weights. Ho-hum.</p>
        <p>Because the spring is about answering questions, addressing concerns and being optimistic, Wickman was a symbolic figure today. Same Topic. Different Year.</p>
        <p>There he was, sweating beside his locker after a brief workout, discussing his future and wondering where he fits on the staff. Same topic. Different year. A sensitive sort, Wickman smiled nervously about being the pitcher without a role. Again.</p>
        <p>"I hope to make the team," said Wickman, his first comments of the spring proving extremely humble. "I think if there's a guy at my age and my experience who doesn't worry about making the team, there's something wrong with him."</p>
        <p>Wickman, who turned 25 this month, won 14 games last season, second to Jimmy Key and only two fewer than the combined total of Abbott and Melido Perez. He was a valuable utility pitcher, shifting from the rotation to the bullpen, where he was tied for second in saves with four. With a bloated earned run average of 4.63, Wickman obviously benefited from the Yankees' averaging 7.3 runs in his 19 starts. But he also had a penchant for winning. He won 2-1 games, won 7-6 games and has a career mark of 20-5. Chances of Starting Are Minimal</p>
        <p>Although Wickman enhanced his repertory by attending the Instructional League and adding a "slip" curveball and modifying his changeup, his chances of securing a spot in the rotation are minimal. Key, Terry Mulholland, Perez and Abbott are assured of spots if they are healthy. That leaves Scott Kamieniecki, Bob Ojeda, Mark Hutton and Sterling Hitchcock as the primary candidates for the fifth position.</p>
        <p>Wickman, who shed 15 pounds, nodded and said nothing when it was mentioned he is usually excluded from discussions about the rotation. He has dissuaded friends from planning visits to New York, until his situation is clearer.</p>
        <p>"I have no idea when this will be settled," Wickman said. "I like to start. They have a lot of other guys who can, too. If I have a long career, I think everything will set up so that I become established. Maybe as a starter. Maybe as a reliever."</p>
        <p>Even Showalter is unsure which role Wickman will handle. While saying that relievers Xavier Hernandez, Paul Assenmacher and Steve Howe had roster spots solidified, Showalter made no such guarantee for Wickman. Of course, part of the omission was motivational and part of it deals with which veterans have guaranteed contracts.</p>
        <p>"We feel Bob has a real good chance to make the club," Showalter said. "That's going to be up to him. At this point, we see him in the bullpen. We know he's capable of doing both."</p>
        <p>Since the Yanks are uncertain whether Hernandez will succeed as a closer, Showalter conceded that he might use several pitchers in that role. Hernandez has only 19 career saves and was basically a setup man for the Astros, which is why the Yankees attempted to sign Gregg Olson and Steve Farr. Now they may use a committee and Wickman could be included in it.</p>
        <p>"It makes it a lot easier for the manager to have one guy," Showalter said. "That's not the only way I know to close games. Would I feel comfortable having two or three people closing games? Yes. There's a chance we'll do that. That may be the way we come out of here." INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>JIM ABBOTT reiterated his plan to stop punishing himself after difficult outings, but gave no insight about his future in New York. "I don't think it's a concern," said Abbott, who can be a free agent after 1994. "Whatever the situation is, it's not going to change the fact that you have to throw a pitch right now." . . . BUCK SHOWALTER hinted that MELIDO PEREZ might not make Thursday's workout because of visa trouble in the Dominican Republic. DAVE SILVESTRI, a minor league shortstop, signed a one-year contract. . . . For the third straight season, STEVE HOWE told the Yankees he would not be speaking to reporters. Howe is suing The New York Post over a gossip item that appeared on Page Six last season. Before he made the announcement Wednesday, no reporters had attempted to interview Howe.</p>
