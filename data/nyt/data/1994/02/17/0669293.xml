        <p>Stock traders nudged up shares across the board yesterday, as the Clinton Administration continued to reassure the currency markets that it was not politicizing the dollar and bond markets were relatively calm. The best movers were economically sensitive stocks like United Technologies and Alcoa.</p>
        <p>Still, bears were turning ever more bearish. Harrison Roth, a senior options strategist at Cowen &amp; Company, derided the notion that the stock market would get to or near the 4,000 level on the Dow because the market was awash in money. Last year, individual and other investors poured a record $128 billion into stock mutual funds.</p>

        <p>Stock traders nudged up shares across the board yesterday, as the Clinton Administration continued to reassure the currency markets that it was not politicizing the dollar and bond markets were relatively calm. The best movers were economically sensitive stocks like United Technologies and Alcoa.</p>
        <p>Still, bears were turning ever more bearish. Harrison Roth, a senior options strategist at Cowen &amp; Company, derided the notion that the stock market would get to or near the 4,000 level on the Dow because the market was awash in money. Last year, individual and other investors poured a record $128 billion into stock mutual funds.</p>
        <p>"The perceived wisdom is that equities is the only game in town, but the fact of the matter is there's more than one town," Mr. Roth said. He cited record dollar inflows into bond funds as well as foreign equity funds, especially those in emerging markets like Mexico and Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Anthony F. Dwyer, chief market strategist for Sherwood Securities Inc., said: "This is the perfect time to be a contrarian, when everyone is putting money into stocks. Pretty soon the buying power of this market is going to run out, probably by the end of the first quarter." Utilities Average Down</p>
        <p>Indeed, yesterday the Dow Jones utilities average, an avidly scrutinized market barometer, declined 2.70 points, to 212.76. When the average, comprising a group of power companies including Pacific Gas and Electric, declines, it is said to signal higher interest rates, which would hurt stocks. Utilities, rich in dividends, act like stocks but also somewhat like fixed-income bonds, analysts say, making utilities useful as an indicator.</p>
        <p>The Dow industrials rose 9 points, to 3,937.27, and the broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 0.27 point, to 472.79. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2.50 points, to 792.62 and the American Stock Exchange market value index rose 0.48 point, to 475.32.</p>
        <p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.19 point, to 262.55, on volume of 295.5 million shares. Advancers exceeded decliners by 1,183 to 965.</p>
        <p>The economic news of the day was generally ignored because traders expect January and February economic data to be distorted by the severe winter in the Northeast and the ruinous California earthquake.</p>
        <p>The Commerce Department reported that January housing starts plunged to an annual rate of 1.29 million units, far worse than the expected 1.38 million units. There was some encouraging news. January building permits, running at an annual rate of 1.36 million, fell less sharply than those of housing starts, indicating more robust building later this year.</p>
        <p>Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, hurt by a slump in demand for jets, got a $6 billion order yesterday from Saudi Arabia, which had been actively courted by the United States.</p>
        <p>Details of the accord were not released but are likely to favor the far larger Boeing, whose stock rose $2.50, to $46.625 a share, in active trading. McDonnell Douglas's stock rose $1.875, to $118.875. The stock of United Technologies, a major aerospace contractor, also benefited, rising $2.625, to $71 a share. United Technologies accounted for 5.9 points of the 9-point gain in the Dow.</p>
        <p>Intel was the most active stock, with volume of 8.2 million shares, in over-the-counter trading. The microchip maker's share price rose $2, to $67, in part because of traders' expectations that a recovering economy would lift its sales of advanced microprocessors.</p>
