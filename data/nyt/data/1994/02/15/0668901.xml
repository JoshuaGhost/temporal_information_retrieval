        <p>When the Fulton Mall was first proposed by the Lindsay administration in the 1960's, it was conceived as a project that would bolster a blighted downtown Brooklyn, one that would maintain a commercial base in an area suffering a long decline. Now more than a decade old, the strip ranks among the nation's busiest urban shopping streets, doing more than $1 million a day in business.</p>
        <p>But recently, the Fulton Mall has drawn attention not for the business it attracts, but for some particularly disturbing crimes. In the most recent incident, an off-duty police officer getting her hair done was in a shootout with three robbers, and survived only because a gun aimed at her head misfired twice.</p>

        <p>When the Fulton Mall was first proposed by the Lindsay administration in the 1960's, it was conceived as a project that would bolster a blighted downtown Brooklyn, one that would maintain a commercial base in an area suffering a long decline. Now more than a decade old, the strip ranks among the nation's busiest urban shopping streets, doing more than $1 million a day in business.</p>
        <p>But recently, the Fulton Mall has drawn attention not for the business it attracts, but for some particularly disturbing crimes. In the most recent incident, an off-duty police officer getting her hair done was in a shootout with three robbers, and survived only because a gun aimed at her head misfired twice.</p>
        <p>The incident, which occurred on Feb. 5, four months after a shooting at the complex's movie theater that killed one and left two bystanders wounded, has left some merchants calling for drastic moves to confront the violence, including the arming of security guards for the outdoor shopping complex that draws an average of 100,000 shoppers a day.</p>
        <p>Though the consensus among store owners and shoppers is that crime is not out of control there, the fear, touched off by the shootout involving the officer, Arlene Beckles, at the beauty parlor, Salon La Mode at 469 Fulton Avenue, set off some tremors.  Shaken by Shooting</p>
        <p>Two men were indicted yesterday on charges of attempted murder in the incident. The Brooklyn District Attorney's office identified one as Luis Medina, 19, of 201 Hawthorne Street in Brooklyn and the other as "John Doe, also known as Fernando Gordon, age and address unknown."</p>
        <p>A third man accused of having been involved in the incident, Fernando Douglas, 19, of 2121 Beekman Place in Brooklyn, on Saturday died of wounds he suffered in the shootout.</p>
        <p>Genevieve McDonald, co-manager of the complex's Lane Bryant outlet, was seriously shaken by the shooting. "We need helicopters overhead," she said. "I feel like I've got to be a cop here every day."</p>
        <p>Last Labor Day, Ms. McDonald was robbed at gunpoint at the store. "The same guys robbed Roy Rogers and a shoe store," she said.</p>
        <p>Rocky Singh, manager of Sack a Gold, a jewelry and electronics store, said hiring more private guards would not suffice. "You don't just need more security," he said. "You need somebody with a gun."</p>
        <p>Arthur Preston, manager of the Nobody Beats the Wiz store, thought it unwise to arm the guards, who are paid for through fees from the local owners. "Those merchants who are concerned should have their own armed security," he said. "We have regular city police officers around here."</p>
        <p>Police Department officials said they have saturated the area with both uniformed and undercover officers over the last few years and pointed out that serious crime in the area has dropped 7 percent over the last two years. Precinct Force Doubles</p>
        <p>Still, the day after the recent shootout, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton cited the incident in announcing that officers would be authorized to use 15-round magazines in their 9-millimeter handguns, instead of 10-round clips.</p>
        <p>The 84th Precinct has a Downtown Squad specifically assigned to patrol the complex and the nearby MetroTech office complex, the business hub of the borough. The squad's leader, Sgt. George Papazahariou, said the unit has been in existence since 1980, but that the precinct commander, Capt. William Dwyer, doubled it to 20 officers over the last three years.</p>
        <p>"It's been the difference between night and day in the quality of life down there," Sergeant Papazahariou said.</p>
        <p>A department spokeswoman, Officer Merri Pearsall, said the number of crimes in five categories -- robbery, burglary, grand larceny, purse snatching and felonious assault -- for the sector that includes the shopping complex had declined to 601 last year from 646 in 1992, a 7 percent drop.</p>
        <p>The Fulton Mall is not a mall in the traditional sense; rather it is an outdoor shopping complex along Fulton Street that was redeveloped to cater to shoppers. Vehicular traffic is mainly banned except to public vehicles like buses.</p>
        <p>Many of the merchants and shoppers, interviewed last week along the street, were not overly alarmed, saying that their chief concern was shoplifting. They added that it would be a grave mistake to give guns to the members of the shopping complex's private security force.</p>
        <p>"In the heat of the moment, some merchants said our guys should have guns," said Robert Ohlerking, director of the Fulton Mall Improvement Association.  Against Arming Guards</p>
        <p>"If a bystander gets shot by one of our guards, to cover that would be much too prohibitive," Mr. Ohlerking said. "It's really not the position of street security to take on the role of the Police Department; it's to be the eyes and ears of the police, to assist shoppers and prevent minor incidents by their presence."</p>
        <p>Mr. Ohlerking said the complex's primary security problems are shoplifting, illegal street peddlers -- most of whom have been chased by the police -- and "rowdy kids who come through after school."</p>
        <p>"Yes, we occasionally have a more serious crime," he said, "and it makes the papers and television. But it happens everywhere."</p>
        <p>Emilio Matos, manager of the Father &amp; Son shoe store, agreed. "I've been here 27 years and I've had three incidents that whole time -- no shooting and no roughness, either," he said. "That ain't bad; I bless myself."</p>
        <p>"The mall guards shouldn't be armed," Mr. Matos added. "Leave that to the police. Some guards aren't screened properly; could be more dangerous than the guy who holds you up."</p>
        <p>Art Saperstein, manager of Sight 'N Style Optical, said arming the guards would breed more violence, "and then innocent people are hit."</p>
        <p>Mr. Saperstein cited his experience in the National Guard during the Newark riots in the 1960's. "Somebody yells, 'Sniper on the roof!' and before you know it 30 people are shooting at the building."</p>
