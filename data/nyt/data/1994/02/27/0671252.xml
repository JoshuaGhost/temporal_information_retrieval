        <p>For the last decade, Michael Dadap and his wife, Yeou-Cheng Ma, have run a mom-and-pop operation from their house in Fresh Meadows: a world-traveling orchestra of youngsters.</p>
        <p>It is called the Children's Orchestra Society, a 120-member ensemble of violinists, cellists, pianists, flutists and guitarists who are following in the bow strokes of the orchestra's most illustrious alumnus: Ms. Ma's younger brother, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma.</p>
        <p>Many of the players have been with the orchestra society for much of their lives, meeting with other members each week for rigorous instruction. Over the years, the youngsters have gone from playing at local churches and community centers to performing at major concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Alice Tully Hall.</p>
        <p>On March 11, the organization is to celebrate its 25th anniversary with a concert at Tully Hall featuring Mr.  Ma. The cellist's appearance with the orchestra represents something of a payoff for the devotion the budding musicians have shown toward their work over the years.</p>
        <p>"From the beginning, I told them, 'You're not going to play with Yo-Yo until you deserve it,' " said Mr. Dadap, a classical guitarist who conducts the orchestra.</p>
        <p>But the organization's goals have gone far beyond simply cultivating the children's musical talents. The Dadaps maintain that the skills required for learning music and performing in an orchestra are the same as those required for daily living: teamwork, discipline and perseverance.</p>
        <p>The two make no profit from running the orchestra; they have devoted themselves to it out of a commitment to music and to children.</p>
        <p>"Our purpose is not to produce the next generation of world-renowned musicians," said Ms. Ma, a developmental pediatrician and the orchestra society's executive director. "Our purpose is to teach them the life skills they will need."</p>
        <p>The organization dates from 1962, when Ms. Ma's father, Dr. Hiao-Tsiun Ma, founded it with a similar vision. Both Ms. Ma and her brother were members of the orchestra until they went to college in the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>By 1977, their father retired from teaching music and conducting the orchestra. But Mr. Dadap and Ms. Ma decided to resurrect the orchestra in August 1984 with 18 new students of their own.</p>
        <p>Since then the organization has flourished, drawing students of varying degrees of proficiency -- most of them between 6 and 18 years old -- from New York City, Long Island and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>It has also given hundreds of performances, trained musicians who went on to study at institutions like the Juilliard School of Music, and completed a concert tour this summer in Asia, performing at one concert before an audience that included the first family of the Philippines.</p>
        <p>"We provide them with a bridge to the professional world," Ms. Ma said, "but they have to trek over it themselves." RAYMOND HERNANDEZ  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: FRESH MEADOWS</p>
