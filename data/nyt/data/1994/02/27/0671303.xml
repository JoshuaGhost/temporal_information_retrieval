        <p>He may be the ultimate model of the devoted father, though he is a bit webbed of paw: He's a bat with breasts.</p>
        <p>Reporting in the journal Nature, scientists last week said they have discovered the first example of a wild male mammal that lactates: a fruit-eating bat called Dyacopterus spadiceus.</p>
        <p>Upon capturing a group of the bats from the Malaysian forest canopy, the researchers were shocked to find that the breasts of all of the adult males were swollen with milk -- a glandular state seen before only in human men suffering from diseases like mammary tumors, or in inbred and possibly mutant domesticated animals.</p>
        <p>The researchers have yet to learn whether the male bats actually suckle their young. Alternatively, the milk could be the incidental byproduct of a diet rich in the plant version of estrogens.</p>
        <p>In any case, said Dr. Thomas H. Kunz of Boston University, who led the team, "this does not mean that a man can eat something, start lactating, and stay home to nurse the kids." NATALIE ANGIER  FEB. 20-26</p>
