        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Alice Kessler-Harris's review is further evidence that the worst enemy faced by career mothers is other women, especially female social scientists who defame women as separate-but-equal nurturers whose sex determines their destiny. Career mothers do not make a Hobson's choice between work and family. The choice they make is to be viewed by their children as a paid-for-her-skills, equal-partner parent, not as the parent who picks up socks and defers to Dad.</p>

        <p>Alice Kessler-Harris's review is further evidence that the worst enemy faced by career mothers is other women, especially female social scientists who defame women as separate-but-equal nurturers whose sex determines their destiny. Career mothers do not make a Hobson's choice between work and family. The choice they make is to be viewed by their children as a paid-for-her-skills, equal-partner parent, not as the parent who picks up socks and defers to Dad.</p>
        <p>Granted, women face many challenges in the workplace, especially when certain men persist in thinking that a woman's place is birthin' babies or, at best, taking dictation. But resourceful women manage to overcome these obstacles. They choose to work with men who don't get bent out of shape when they have to take time off during snow days and sick days. They also select marriage partners who hold up their end of the partnership by performing domestic duties.</p>
        <p>Above all, today's career mothers take pride in the fact that they're raising the first generation of girls to assume that a mother's rightful place is in the workplace.  JANE WHITE  Waldwick, N.J.</p>
