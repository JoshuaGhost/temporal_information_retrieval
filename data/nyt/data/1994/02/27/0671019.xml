        <p>GEORGE WALLACE American Populist. By Stephan Lesher. Illustrated. 587 pp. New York: A William Patrick Book/ Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. $29.95.</p>
        <p>DURING most of George C. Wallace's extraordinary political career, his many detractors usually characterized him in one of two ways. To some, he was an authentic voice of white supremacy. Whatever he said, on whatever issue, contained a coded racist message. To others, he was a rank opportunist -- a man of no real convictions, seeking nothing but political advantage. A Southern moderate early in his career, Mr. Wallace became a strident segregationist after losing an early campaign for governor of Alabama to a candidate who played the race card more effectively than he did. Much later in his life, he tried to conciliate black Alabamians after they became a significant voting bloc in his state.</p>
        <p>Stephan Lesher, a former correspondent who covered Governor Wallace for Newsweek, offers a different assessment in this informative biography, the first serious study of the whole of Mr. Wallace's career -- and one with which Mr. Wallace himself cooperated extensively. Mr. Wallace was often a racist and often an opportunist, Mr. Lesher says, but he was, above all, a populist; it was his instinctive understanding of what he called "this average man in the streets" that drove his politics from beginning to end.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesher maintains that this broad populist message, much more than its racist mutation, was responsible for Governor Wallace's extraordinary success in national politics. Mr. Wallace was not just the last of the great racial demagogues of the Jim Crow South (although he was that for a time). He was also the first of a new breed of protest politicians, the first to articulate themes that have no inherent racial content and that have now become a staple of American politics, having shaped every national campaign from Richard Nixon's in 1968 to Bill Clinton's and Ross Perot's in 1992.</p>
        <p>There is much in Governor Wallace's life and career to support the claims Mr. Lesher makes in "George Wallace: American Populist." He was born in 1919 in the small town of Clio, Ala., into a family clinging precariously, and not always successfully, to its middle-class status. Mr. Wallace gravitated toward politics as if by instinct. He became active in campus politics at the University of Alabama as the champion of relatively poor students like him against the wealthier fraternity elites. And he entered state politics as a young man, attaching himself to James E. (Big Jim) Folsom, the flamboyant populist governor who always championed the "little man" against the "interests."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallace rose in state politics through the same kind of constant and obsessive effort that characterized the early careers of his contemporaries Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon. He served briefly in the state legislature and then as a state circuit court judge. In 1958, when he lost his first race for governor to his fellow Democrat John Patterson, a more stridently racist opponent, he did not, Mr. Lesher argues, make the oft-quoted statement "I'm not going to be out-niggered again." But he did conclude that a fierce defense of white supremacy was becoming the sine qua non of Alabama politics. And four years later, he stormed into the governorship with a campaign based on almost nothing else.</p>
        <p>In 1963, Governor Wallace gained national prominence as a result of a dramatic confrontation with Federal authorities as they tried to integrate the University of Alabama. Shortly after that, he began cultivating an audience beyond Alabama while clinging to the governorship with an almost desperate persistence. In 1966, barred by law from succeeding himself, he persuaded his wife, Lurleen, to run in his stead. She won the election, but died of cancer early in her term. Mr. Wallace won the governorship again in 1970. From 1964 through 1976, he was a factor in every Presidential election campaign. And in 1968, running as the candidate of his newly created American Independent Party, he won more than 13 percent of the popular vote. In the 20th century, only Theodore Roosevelt, Robert La Follette and Ross Perot have done better in challenging the two major parties.</p>
        <p>As his ambitions grew and his constituencies expanded, Mr. Lesher reports, Governor Wallace gradually broadened his message. In Alabama and in his early national campaigning, he focused almost exclusively on race. There was an element of class resentment in his rhetoric, to be sure, but it was the resentment of one class of whites (ordinary people) against another (liberal elites) over racial policies. By 1968, however, his rhetoric had become more generically populist.</p>
        <p>The Federal Government, he contended, was an affront to ordinary people not just because it forced them to integrate their schools and businesses, but also because it saddled them with excessive taxes, created bloated bureaucracies and subjected them to the whims of a smug and complacent class of people who scorned their values and goals. His famous litany of average Americans -- "this man in the steel mill, this barber, the beautician, the policeman on the beat . . . the little businessman" -- drew a line in the sand between "the people" and what Governor Wallace often called "the pointy heads," the haughty, condescending elitists who presumed to govern them.</p>
        <p>In his national campaigns, Governor Wallace laid out in flamboyant and often witty form much of what would soon become the program of the New Right. Back home in Alabama, however, he was in some respects a progressive figure. He supported more money for education and for social services to the poor. And he made his contempt for wealthy aristocrats a staple of his rhetoric.</p>
        <p>In 1972, an apparently deranged stalker, Arthur Bremer, shot Mr. Wallace during a campaign stop at a Maryland shopping center. The assassination attempt left him crippled and in constant pain. It also, he later claimed, gave him a new outlook on suffering. Partly as a result of that and partly in response to the growth of the black electorate, he set out in the early 1970's to reconcile with African-Americans. In his later terms as governor (the last of which ended in 1987), he began appointing blacks to government jobs and extending social services in black communities. And in 1979, he made an unannounced appearance at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery -- the church of which Martin Luther King Jr. had been pastor during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955 -- and told the congregation: "I have learned what suffering means. . . . I think I can understand something of the pain that black people have come to endure. I know I contributed to that pain, and I can only ask your forgiveness." A recent poll of black Alabamians ranks Mr. Wallace as the best governor in the history of the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lesher is certainly correct that we need to think more broadly about the meaning of the Wallace phenomenon. The glib way so many liberals once dismissed Governor Wallace and his followers as white-trash racists says more about the narrowness of vision among elitists than about the character of the Wallace movement itself. But Mr. Lesher also overstates his case. Governor Wallace's message was never a purely racist one, but at the height of his power he drew his strength almost entirely from white anxieties about integration. He did nothing to discourage Klansmen, Birchers and racial extremists of all kinds from flocking to his banner; in many places outside the South, they formed the organizational heart of his campaigns. And through 1968, at least, opposition to race-related Federal initiatives was always at the center of his message.</p>
        <p>Nor were the anti-Government resentments Governor Wallace so effectively articulated in any way new sentiments, as Mr. Lesher says at times. Mr. Wallace did not create ideas. He simply tapped into a well-established tradition of populist resentment that had been in wide and constant circulation since at least the 1890's.</p>
        <p>What was new about George Wallace was his style -- a caustic, snarling, gleefully disdainful, distinctively Southern political style that had rarely before (and has never since) been nearly so visible or effective in national politics. The style was responsible for much of Governor Wallace's popularity but also, to a large degree, for the very real limits of his appeal. It remained for more polished politicians to pillage the store of ideas and grievances that Governor Wallace helped elevate to prominence and make them the basis of more viable national movements.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most surprising thing about this book, however, is that it has taken this long for someone to write a serious study of one of the 20th century's most important political figures. Historians will debate Governor Wallace's impact for many years, but few will question that his legacy is a major one.  Alan Brinkley is a professor of American history at Columbia University.</p>
