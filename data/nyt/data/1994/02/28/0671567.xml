        <p>A few bars into Simon Shaheen's violin introduction, opening the second half of "The Music of Lebanon" at Washington Square Church on Friday night, the memories of the first half began to dissipate nicely. Mr. Shaheen, originally from Lebanon but now living in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, exudes excellence. He snapped his rhythms percussively and stretched them out. He made notes insinuate all sorts of things; he played cadences out of the European classical tradition, then nudged his notes from above and below, using the Arabic tradition to make them cry.</p>
        <p>The first half of the concert presented rural tunes played for marriages, parties and funerals. The two main performers, Ali Jihad Racy on various flutes and string instruments, worked with Mansour Ajami, a singer and poet who also performed on the oud, a lutelike instrument. They were backed by two singers and a percussionist and for the most part they performed sedate music that probably needed a marriage or a party or a funeral to get it charged up. It's beautiful, often simple music based on a chord or two and repeating melodies, all embellished with trills and wavering melismas. Mr. Ajami clearly likes his fun, and by the end of the first half he broke a bit of a sweat, and the performance began to coalesce.</p>

        <p>A few bars into Simon Shaheen's violin introduction, opening the second half of "The Music of Lebanon" at Washington Square Church on Friday night, the memories of the first half began to dissipate nicely. Mr. Shaheen, originally from Lebanon but now living in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, exudes excellence. He snapped his rhythms percussively and stretched them out. He made notes insinuate all sorts of things; he played cadences out of the European classical tradition, then nudged his notes from above and below, using the Arabic tradition to make them cry.</p>
        <p>The first half of the concert presented rural tunes played for marriages, parties and funerals. The two main performers, Ali Jihad Racy on various flutes and string instruments, worked with Mansour Ajami, a singer and poet who also performed on the oud, a lutelike instrument. They were backed by two singers and a percussionist and for the most part they performed sedate music that probably needed a marriage or a party or a funeral to get it charged up. It's beautiful, often simple music based on a chord or two and repeating melodies, all embellished with trills and wavering melismas. Mr. Ajami clearly likes his fun, and by the end of the first half he broke a bit of a sweat, and the performance began to coalesce.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shaheen's presence, and his musical authority, changed everything during the second half. The musicians began playing music associated with urban areas, and it became more complicated and more percussive. He and Mr. Racy opened with a composition of Mr. Racy's that used harmony, and the two musicians swapped unaccompanied improvisations until they both moved into composed sections. Mr. Shaheen brought out his oud, and he and Mr. Racy were joined by the percussionist Michel Merhej. The music, more rhythmic, moved from tense rubato sections to driving, powerful improvisations. The rest of the performers came out and the music became orchestral, with Mr. Ajami singing wave after wave of surging melody, only to be answered by the instrumentalists. Riffs pealed; the music, tough and lush, built and built as it tried to take the audience away with it.</p>
