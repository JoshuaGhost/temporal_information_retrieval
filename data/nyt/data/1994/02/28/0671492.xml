        <p>On the night before he killed more than three dozen Muslims at prayer in the dimly lighted Cave of the Patriarchs, Dr. Baruch Goldstein himself prayed in the cave, on the Jewish side of the shrine.</p>
        <p>He was there to participate in services marking the Jewish holiday of Purim. But when Arab worshipers on the other side of the partition began to taunt the Jews, Dr. Goldstein seemed particularly distraught, other settlers said.</p>
        <p>"The Arabs were screaming out during our prayers that the Jews should be slaughtered," said Yehuda Burdman, a settler. "The fact that he could not even say his prayers greatly upset him." A 2,500-Year-Old Story</p>
        <p>The next morning at about 5, Israeli Army investigators said, Dr. Goldstein walked out of his ground-floor apartment here dressed in the captain's uniform he wore as an army reserve doctor. He carried an Israeli-made Galil rifle and at least four ammunition clips with 35 bullets apiece.</p>
        <p>It was the dawn of Purim, a raucous holiday celebrating the deliverance of Persian Jews from a plot to destroy them in the fifth century B.C. and the fierce revenge they took against their enemies. Dr. Goldstein's friends, as perhaps he hoped they would, compared him today to Mordechai, the hero of the Purim story.</p>
        <p>The doctor, who was well-known to soldiers and settlers, arrived at the Cave of the Patriarchs at about 5:30, entering through a side entrance and passing by soldiers, who did not challenge him. He moved swiftly toward the door of the mosque, where hundreds of Arabs were saying their Friday morning prayers in observance of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of penance.</p>
        <p>Muhammed Abu Saleh, a guard at the mosque door, said that Dr. Goldstein had demanded to enter, saying he was the duty officer, and that when Mr. Abu Saleh objected, the doctor knocked him down with the butt of his rifle.</p>
        <p>"When I saw him, he was running toward the hall where everyone was saying prayers," said Khatem Kafisha, who had been taking off his shoes near the door. "He could have shot any one of us who was outside, but it was clear he only wanted to open fire on the worshipers so he could hit as many people as possible.</p>
        <p>"He didn't say a word."</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein slipped a clip into his assault rifle, put on what witnesses described as protective ear cups to deaden the noise and opened fire on the Muslims kneeling in tight rows, heads bowed to the ground. He stood near near the back wall of the mosque, out of range of closed-circuit television cameras that are monitored by Israeli soldiers at the shrine.</p>
        <p>The doctor fired 111 rounds from three and a half clips, army investigators said.</p>
        <p>Worshipers reported hearing long bursts of gunfire. Some also said loud explosions shook the mosque, but Israeli officials said there was no evidence that grenades were used. The massacre was over in about two minutes.</p>
        <p>As the dead and wounded lay on their blood-soaked prayer rugs, survivors stampeded for exits and jittery Israeli soldiers fired several rounds into the ceiling in an effort to restore order, according to army investigators. Survivors rushed to help the wounded, and a worshiper knocked Dr. Goldstein to the ground with a fire extinguisher. He was beaten to death by the enraged crowd, some using metal bars that were part of a partition in the shrine.  A Private Burial</p>
        <p>"The crowd finished him off," said Mr. Abu Saleh, the guard.</p>
        <p>The doctor was buried late this afternoon with a private ceremony in Qiryat Arba. The army was concerned that burial in the Jewish cemetery in the center of Hebron could set off a clash with Arab residents. News reports said one funeral home in Jerusalem had refused to prepare the body.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein had been deeply distressed by recent Palestinian attacks against Jews, several of whom died under his care, according to his friends and neighbors. Several friends described him as unusually edgy in recent days, even refusing to visit patients.</p>
        <p>"Last week we called him because our four-month-old was running a temperature," said Baruch Ben-Yaacov, a settler who lives in a small Jewish enclave inside Hebron. "He was unusually brusque with us. He said there was no need for him to come see the baby. This was very unlike him, and the next day he came back and apologized. He was under a lot of stress and it showed." A Deepening Sense Of Betrayal</p>
        <p>The mayhem unleashed in the mosque and the doctor's death have turned him into a martyr to many of the settlers, who were busy today putting up posters in his memory.</p>
        <p>But as details emerge about the attack, it appears to have been the culmination of weeks, even months, of bitterness and anger at what Dr. Goldstein considered a betrayal by the Government, and frustration at mounting attacks by Arab militants, an enemy many settlers freely equate with Nazis.</p>
        <p>"He talked a lot about the Holocaust," said Mr. Ben-Yaacov, who was stabbed in the neck by Palestinians and treated by Dr. Goldstein. "He said Jews should never again be led like sheep to the slaughter."</p>
        <p>The massacre seems to have been a fitting climax for a man who had centered his world around what he saw as a sacred war against his enemies. And many Jews said he had cracked under the strain of too much violence and a peace accord that seemed to betray what he saw as a Biblical quest for a greater Israel.</p>
        <p>Many Jews, who gathered in small groups in the drizzle that drenched Qiryat Arba today, said they shared Dr. Goldstein's anger and feeling of powerlessness.</p>
        <p>"Until you experience the pain he felt you can't condemn him," said a middle-aged woman who lives near the Goldsteins. "It crushed him to see Jews get hurt and no one, not even the Government, ever react. He could not stand to see the Jewish people live in their own land and yet not be free."</p>
        <p>The inner world of Dr. Goldstein was clearly colored by the messianic, often racist rantings of radical Jewish settlers who deny Palestinian rights to the occupied territories and say the world is bent on exterminating the Jews.</p>
        <p>But such extremist ideology provided more than a framework for Dr. Goldstein's world view; it also allowed a man filled with rage to find an outlet.</p>
        <p>A penchant for violence was apparent just outside the door of the apartment where Dr. Goldstein had lived.</p>
        <p>Two Jewish settlers, speaking fluent English, stood at the door. When two reporters from The New York Times identified themselves, one settler attacked them in the narrow corridor, kicking and shoving the reporters out of the building.</p>
        <p>"You're not moving fast enough!" screamed the heavy-set man, with a pistol tucked in his belt. "I'll kick you down the stairs! Get out! Get out!" The Painful Sight Of Friends Dying</p>
        <p>As the doctor's ideological structure began to crumble, first with the assassination of the radical Rabbi Meir Kahane and then with the peace talks with the Palestinians, it cast him adrift, neighbors said. And when several friends were killed by Palestinians, something in him snapped, they said.</p>
        <p>"The murder of Rabbi Kahane had a huge effect on him," said a neighbor in the building, who would only identify himself as Eli. "He looked like a shadow of himself after the Kahane murder, but the killing of his friend Mordechai Lapid, who died in his arms last December, broke him. His ideas became even more radical.</p>
        <p>"He always talked of revenge. He was a quiet man, but in his heart he was seething with anger."</p>
        <p>Mr. Lapid was ambushed on Dec. 6 by Palestinian gunmen just outside the settlement. One of Mr. Lapid's sons also died in the shooting and three of his children were wounded.</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldstein was one of the first people on the scene, but he could not save his friend.</p>
        <p>"If the people he took care of died, we would see him crying," said a 16-year-old neighbor. "He loved Jews. He was a righteous man." No Tears Here For Dead Arabs</p>
        <p>There was little remorse expressed by the settlers in Qiryat Arba for the scores of dead Palestinians left sprawled on the floor of the mosque. But most bemoaned the death of the doctor -- and even defended his attack.</p>
        <p>"This act should not be condemned," said Mr. Ben-Yaacov, who immigrated from Stony Brook. L.I., and converted to Judaism. "If none of us condemn the act, it will make the Arabs afraid and prevent many attacks.</p>
        <p>"This act, which sanctified God's name, shows the Arabs that we will not remain silent and watch them spill Jewish blood with impunity."</p>
        <p>Matityahu Alansky, a New York native, stood outside Dr. Goldstein's yellow limestone apartment building, where he had just left a letter of condolence for the doctor's widow and children.</p>
        <p>He said the doctor had bolstered the spirits of many settlers, who fear the Government will close the settlements as part of the peace accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>"We are proud of what he did," Mr. Alansky said. "He has given us pride as Jews. He is a hero. People may have died, but he has given life to the country. He has shown us that God is with us, that Jews will now fight back."</p>
        <p>At a small grocery just yards from Dr. Goldstein's apartment, employees were pasting a large sign in Hebrew on the window. The men, some carrying automatic weapons, stood under a small tarpaulin that protected them from the rain. Many wore damp black army boots.</p>
        <p>"We wish to express our pain and sorrow at the loss of the martyr Dr. Baruch Goldstein," the sign read.</p>
        <p>The hand-lettered notice likened the death of Dr. Goldstein to that of the prophet Elijah, who ascended to heaven in a chariot of fire.</p>
        <p>"He was a good doctor," said a 35-year-old man standing in front of the sign. "We called him the angel."  WEST BANK MASSACRE</p>
