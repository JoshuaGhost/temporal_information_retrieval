        <p>Meeting at an Italian restaurant on Long Island on Saturday night, the power brokers of the state Republican party failed once again to bury their differences and forge a consensus around a candidate for governor, leaving the party still directionless as it heads into a campaign ripe with possibility.</p>

        <p>Meeting at an Italian restaurant on Long Island on Saturday night, the power brokers of the state Republican party failed once again to bury their differences and forge a consensus around a candidate for governor, leaving the party still directionless as it heads into a campaign ripe with possibility.</p>
        <p>Like previous such gatherings, the session between Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato; Ralph J. Marino, the State Senate majority leader; Joseph N. Mondello, the Nassau County Republican leader, and William D. Powers, the state Republican chairman, ended without an agreement, Mr. D'Amato said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Three of the four who broke bread at Giulio Cesare, a D'Amato haunt in Westbury, L.I., are products of the vaunted Nassau Republican machine. But each has his own political agenda, and those agendas have largely been at cross-purposes when it comes to picking a gubernatorial candidate.</p>
        <p>If they are to take advantage of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's unquestioned vulnerability this year, party leaders feel it is vital to find a consensus candidate early. Their goal has been to rally the party machinery around a candidate who can win the support of both the Republican Party and the Conservative Party to avoid a costly, time-consuming primary campaign. 'Some Progress'</p>
        <p>Of the meeting, Senator D'Amato said, "We talked and talked and talked and we agreed to continue to work together to develop the strongest candidate to beat Cuomo. There was no resolution, but we made some progress. The progress was that we're going to continue to talk."</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers said, "We agreed to keep trying to agree. That really was the summary of four hours."</p>
        <p>Four years ago, the Republicans and Conservatives nominated different candidates and split the anti-Cuomo vote. The Governor won re-election with 53 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Now two full months into 1994, and only three months before the state convention, where the Republicans are to endorse a candidate, the party's leaders have made little progress. Fourteen potential candidates are still at least considering the race, and a difficult September primary seems more and more likely.</p>
        <p>Some top Republicans believe a primary could help an unknown candidate win needed statewide attention. But others feel it will only drain resources that are better saved for the general-election campaign against Mr. Cuomo, who already has a war chest of more than $3 million. 'Only One Way'</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the efforts of party leaders to anoint a nominee have deeply alienated many Republicans who are actively running. "There seems to be only one way to win and that's the way Al D'Amato and his pundits say," said Herbert London, who ran four years ago as a Conservative and is running again this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Amato, who like Mr. Marino and Mr. Mondello is from Nassau County, has been pushing the candidacy of State Senator George E. Pataki of Peekskill. He is supported in this by Mr. Powers, a former D'Amato aide who runs the state party.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Pataki is little known outside of his district, both Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Powers believe he fits the profile of a Cuomo slayer, as defined by the party's public-opinion polls and focus groups. He is middle-aged, suburban, ethnic and telegenic, and is an elected official who has voted against tax increases and for the death penalty. He also says he supports abortion rights, although abortion-rights advocacy groups point out that he has voted to restrict access to abortion. A Hard Line</p>
        <p>But Mr. Marino has taken a hard line against Mr. Pataki, even though he is one of the 35 members of Mr. Marino's Senate Republican caucus. Mr. Pataki, a former Assemblyman, angered Mr. Marino by running successfully in 1992 against an incumbent Republican senator. More significantly, he won with heavy support from Change-N.Y., a conservative anti-tax group that was simultaneously trying to unseat Mr. Marino.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marino does not want to send a message to his Republican members that such disloyalty will be tolerated, much less rewarded, his aides say.</p>
        <p>Marino aides said late last week that they expected Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Powers to suggest that Mr. Pataki would resign from the Senate in exchange for Mr. Marino's support. But they said Mr. Marino would not accept the deal. "It doesn't do anything to change what happened before," said one aide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marino, meanwhile, might be willing to support Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who has expressed interest in running for governor after winning a difficult re-election campaign last year. But Republican leaders said Mr. Gulotta has faced resistance from Mr. Mondello, who in turn holds significant sway over Mr. Marino and Mr. D'Amato. Mr. Mondello is said to be concerned about keeping the county executive's seat in Republican hands if Mr. Gulotta leaves for Albany.</p>
        <p>The result is that the Nassau Republicans' squabbling threatens to derail what many view as the party's best chance in years to win the governor's office. "Nassau County could be portrayed as a major force in picking the statewide ticket," said one Nassau Republican leader, speaking on condition of anonymity. "But tragically, right now it's the opposite."</p>
