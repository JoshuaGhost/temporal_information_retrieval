        <p>Juliet Sieveking Saunders, a former New York City school district superintendent whose doctoral dissertation became the basis for a handbook for the city's elementary school principals, died on Saturday at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 86.</p>
        <p>The cause of death was a heart attack, said Jack Bloomfield, a friend.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Saunders started her career as a teacher and an assistant principal and then worked as principal at Junior High School 220 in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. In 1969, she was among the first district superintendents to be selected by the newly decentralized community school boards.</p>
        <p>In her dissertation, written while she was a student at New York University's School of Education, Mrs. Saunders found that the city's elementary school principals performed an average of 446 different duties as part of their jobs.</p>
        <p>The tasks ranged from helping to repair broken windows to fine tuning the school's curriculum. The study concluded that principals spent too much of their time doing routine paperwork and that they should get more help in managing their schools. A handbook for elementary school principals, published by the Board of Education, included much of this information and was edited by Mrs. Saunders.</p>
        <p>She was named to the hall of fame at Hunter College, her alma mater, and received the Medal of Honor from the New York Academy of Public Education in 1988.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Saunders's husband, Leonard, died in 1967.</p>
        <p>She is survived by a nephew, Harry Saunders of Stamford, Conn.</p>
