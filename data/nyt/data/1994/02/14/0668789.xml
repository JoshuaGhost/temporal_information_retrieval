        <p>The collapsed parking garage on the campus of California State University at Northridge is in many ways the signature image of last month's violent earthquake here, a tangle of concrete and steel that in one deadly instant could have been a coffin for countless students and faculty members had the quake not struck in the predawn hours and during the semester break.</p>
        <p>Classes for 24,000 students are to resume at Northridge on Monday in a hastily assembled village of trailers and tents. Repairs to the 53 buildings on campus, all of them damaged in varying degrees, are expected to cost at least $250 million.</p>

        <p>The collapsed parking garage on the campus of California State University at Northridge is in many ways the signature image of last month's violent earthquake here, a tangle of concrete and steel that in one deadly instant could have been a coffin for countless students and faculty members had the quake not struck in the predawn hours and during the semester break.</p>
        <p>Classes for 24,000 students are to resume at Northridge on Monday in a hastily assembled village of trailers and tents. Repairs to the 53 buildings on campus, all of them damaged in varying degrees, are expected to cost at least $250 million.</p>
        <p>But except for the total failure of the two-year-old garage of questionable design, the amount of destruction is about what experts expected at a site that was virtually at the epicenter of a violent earthquake.</p>
        <p>And of the structures that cracked, shifted, burned or sheared from their moorings at the Northridge campus, only one, a classroom and office tower, was on the state's list of university buildings known to be earthquake hazards, a list that also includes Royce Hall on the University of California campus here and Memorial Stadium in Berkeley. A Call for Priorities</p>
        <p>It is those listed buildings, scores of them across the state that have been identified as dangerous but are awaiting costly repair, that raise subtle but complicated questions about how the California state university systems should spend their limited capital.</p>
        <p>Should the systems, comprising 29 campuses serving nearly a half-million students, be expected to immediately upgrade or demolish all of their buildings known to be hazards? Or should earthquake safety be but one concern among many for the cash-starved institutions?</p>
        <p>State Senator Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, a Democratic candidate for governor, has argued that the tax-supported universities should be required to fix every building known to be at risk of collapse before embarking on any other capital projects and meanwhile should post warning signs.</p>
        <p>"In my view," Mr. Hayden said, "there shouldn't be one dime spent until the existing buildings are safe."</p>
        <p>University officials countered that Mr. Hayden's absolutist approach ignored the realities of educating huge numbers of students and maintaining adequate structures in recessionary times. It also fails to take into account that seismic work can be done on only one or two buildings at a time.</p>
        <p>And, the officials say, Mr. Hayden's recommendations exaggerate the risks. In the five major earthquakes in California since 1971, campuses have sustained millions of dollars in damage but only one person has been killed, a student at California State University at Los Angeles, who was crushed by falling plaster in 1987.</p>
        <p>"What happens after these occurrences is people get panicky and say you have to spend all the money on seismic stuff," said Larry Hershman, associate vice president for the budget at the University of California. "But it can't work that way. There are a lot of pressures and a lot of needs."</p>
        <p>While elected officials and university administrators debate the pace of seismic repair, a group of architects and engineers huddles here each day outside Royce Hall, looking toward the pair of brick towers that cracked in the Jan. 17 quake and threaten to fall at the next tremor. Temporary Safety Measures</p>
        <p>As the men ponder the endangered towers, classes continue inside the Italian Romanesque building, where students and faculty members, some nervous and others blase, enter and exit through new enclosed passageways that funnel them far from the front portico and are reinforced to bear 650 pounds of rubble per square inch.</p>
        <p>The stricken landmark, about 20 miles from the epicenter, is one of several buildings known to be hazardous in the original quadrangle at U.C.L.A., where officials estimate the recent quake caused at least $20 million in damage.</p>
        <p>The hazardous buildings on California's campuses were first identified in the 1970's by the state Seismic Safety Commission, using a formula that took into account the age of the structure, its design, its location in relation to the web of earthquake faults and its patterns of occupancy. Meeting Other Requirements</p>
        <p>But few repairs were made in the administrations of Gov. Ronald Reagan, a Republican, or Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., a Democrat, when the universities received no state money for capital projects. That changed in the mid-1980's with a series of bond measures, which allowed the public universities to begin playing catch-up.</p>
        <p>But during those boom years for California, the universities, which are required to accommodate a certain percentage of the state's high school graduates, also embarked on huge building projects. They began modernizing laboratories and electrical systems, many of which posed safety hazards. More recently, they met Federal requirements on the environment and access for the handicapped.</p>
        <p>Little by little, said L. Thomas Tobin, executive director of the state commission, university administrators have focused on seismic safety, particularly in the last few years as enrollment has leveled off and with it the pressure to expand. But scores of unsafe buildings remain, like the library at California State University at San Bernardino and the dining commons at Humboldt State. Despite the Risks</p>
        <p>The Berkeley stadium, where 75,000 people watch football games directly atop a creeping earthquake fault, is a chilling example of poor decision-making at the universities. The brittle concrete structure, built in 1923 and noticeably deformed from the movement of the Hayward fault, was rated as "fair" rather than "poor" or "very poor" only because of it stood empty on all but a half-dozen autumn Saturdays.</p>
        <p>Despite the known risks, the athletic department at Berkeley used privately raised money to expand in the basement of the stadium, where coaches' offices and a weight room were constructed, thus changing the building's occupancy patterns and its safety rating. In a 1990 report, the seismic commission criticized the department's decision, touching a nerve of fear by noting that Candlestick Park in San Francisco had been full for a World Series game when the 1989 earthquake struck there.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from the commission, the athletic department then agreed to seek financing for a seismic upgrade or move the offices and weight room. No money could be found, and the offices remain in use. They are scheduled to be vacated at the end of this academic year, said Jeffrey Gee, the director of project management on the Berkeley campus.</p>
        <p>Similarly, at Royce Hall here, private donations made possible the construction of a rehearsal hall when there was no money available for earthquake-related improvements. That rehearsal hall is now closed because the front section of the 1929 building is at risk of collapse.</p>
        <p>The classrooms in the rear are in use, deemed safe by campus architects and essential to the crowded university, said Cynthia Ingham, the assistant director of capital planning at U.C.L.A.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ingham said all of Royce Hall would be vacated at the end of March, when the hectic winter quarter was over. And the schedule for seismic work has been speeded, with the $23 million project scheduled for next year rather than 1999. A Right to Know?</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, students differ on whether it makes them nervous to be inside. "I don't even think about it," said Dona Won, a graduate student in education.</p>
        <p>Ms. Won's classmate, Karie Mize, disagreed. "I'd rather be moved to a different building," she said, adding that feeling aftershocks while inside the building made her queasy.</p>
        <p>Royce Hall needs no warning sign of the kind Mr. Hayden advocates because the sight of the safety tunnel speaks louder than words. But that debate continues here. The seismic commission endorsed the idea of signs, saying people had a "paramount right to know if a building they enter poses an appreciable hazard to life."</p>
        <p>But University of California lobbyists have blocked such measures. "You would have to close buildings, turn away students," said William B. Baker, vice president for external affairs.</p>
        <p>The chancellor of the California State University system, Barry Munitz, said he was neutral on the matter of warning signs. Yet he mused on the folly of thinking that the state can tell people what is dangerous.</p>
        <p>"If we had done this at Northridge," he said, "the building that really fell down wouldn't have had a sign on it."</p>
