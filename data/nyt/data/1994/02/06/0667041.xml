        <p>THE debate over health care reform increasingly takes on the trappings of a morality play, but how should the doctor be cast?</p>
        <p>Americans aren't sure. They like their own doctors, but increasingly they think the profession is greedy and arrogant, according to surveys for the American Medical Association. They think most doctors are genuinely interested in their patients, but they also think doctors charge too much and keep people waiting too long. They cling to a golden view of the past: More than half agree with the statement that "Doctors don't care about people as much as they used to."</p>
        <p>Looming over any health care debate is the image of the general practitioner of yesteryear: Marcus Welby before his practice was purchased by a managed-care corporation. Hillary Rodham Clinton waxes rhapsodic about primary care physicians, the foot soldiers of the Administration's stated goal of providing preventive medicine and cost-effective health care to all. Government programs and reimbursement policies helped create the current imbalance between primary care doctors and specialists, she says -- an estimated 70 percent of all American physicians are specialists -- and the government should try to change it. "The American people did not stand on the street corners and say, 'Give us more thoracic surgeons,' " she told doctors in Georgia.</p>
        <p>Of course, neither are most people out in the streets chanting "Give us more primary care physicians," which in the Administration's proposal covers family practitioners, internists, general pediatricians and obstetrician/gynecologists. Americans clearly long for a personal relationship with their doctor -- this is particularly true for women -- and older Americans can often summon up halcyon memories of a doctor who knew the family, came to the house, attended births and deaths. In many medically under-served areas, especially rural and inner-city communities, the hunger for this kind of doctor is acute.</p>
        <p>But many Americans have also gotten used to the stacks of specialists in the acres of medical office buildings that have spread like high-tech shopping malls in the last 40 years. Specialists are often cast as villains in the debate over health care -- avaricious, chilly, prone to prescribing expensive tests and excessive procedures. But many Americans still want an otolaryngologist when a child gets an ear infection and a breast cancer specialist when a lump appears. People may pine for the old but they demand the new, particularly when they are sick. They may love their family doctor, but the phrase "the best in his field" has a powerful allure. Choosing a Villain</p>
        <p>Bob Blendon, an expert on public opinion and health at Harvard, describes a kind of Mayo Clinic syndrome: "I don't care who my primary care doctor is, when I get really sick I'm going to Mayo or Hopkins and I don't want anybody telling me I have to go to a local hospital."</p>
        <p>Against the image of the kind and empathic family doctor is another image, increasingly offered up by the critics of managed care, on Capitol Hill and elsewhere: The primary care doctor as gatekeeper, standing in the way of patients who would rather be seeing a specialist, but have no choice because of their insurance company policies. The Clinton forces say that their plan guards against that kind of practice: Employees are to be given a choice among several plans. And every region is explicitly required to include among those options a fee-for-service plan -- the traditional form of medicine, in which the patient chooses a doctor who is then reimbursed on the basis of each service performed.</p>
        <p>All of these contradictory impulses make for complicated politics for the Clintons, who would like to be seen as the leaders of a people's rebellion against the medical-industrial juggernaut. This is easy enough when it comes to the insurance industry: Despite the best efforts of their neighborly spokespeople, Harry and Louise, insurance companies still engender considerable resentment, according to the public opinion polls. The pharmaceutical industry, despite its own frenetic efforts at image repair, is another easy villain. But even though doctors have been among the more outspoken critics of the Clinton plan, they retain a certain amount of political protection.</p>
        <p>Even as the Mercedes-driving physician becomes a staple of the popular culture, people still want a sense of personal connection with their doctor. If faith in technological expertise keeps the specialist in power, the Marcus Welby syndrome protects the primary care physician. "It has to do with whether you care about me or not," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic polltaker who has studied people's attitudes toward primary care physicians. "It's that notion of caring and continuity."</p>
        <p>Throughout all the changes in American medicine, that yearning has endured. "It's become much more depersonalized and much more technological, and because of the high overhead, doctors tend to spend very few minutes with patients and run them through," said Representative Jim McDermott, a Washington Democrat who has practiced medicine and is now involved in the effort to reshape it. "So there's been an erosion of that feeling of connectedness, but it's still there."</p>
        <p>It's not just older people who feel this need. Dr. Robert Graham, executive vice president of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said, "I sense even within the well-insured, affluent, what we used to call yuppie communities, there's a movement toward people feeling there's a degree of fragmentation in their medical care that they'd like to get a handle on." Primary care doctors can become the guides through a complicated maze of specialists and insurance requirements.</p>
        <p>These attitudes, confused as they are, present a challenge for Mr. Clinton, and for anyone advocating a comprehensive restructuring of the health care system. Warnings that health care plans will restrict the choice of physicians can cut two ways: People may worry about losing a primary care doctor with whom they have a long-term relationship -- and they may worry about never getting to see the specialist they want.</p>
        <p>Some analysts argue that the choice issue is nowhere near as powerful as it once was, that "the sort of image that was set with Norman Rockwell is just no longer the reality for an awful lot of people," as the pollster Peter Hart put it. In the current system, these analysts say, more and more people are forced to change doctors more often, more and more people have grown accustomed to group practices, and more and more people have become used to episodic, on-the-fly care.</p>
        <p>By and large, though, Administration strategists seem unwilling to take a chance, treating doctors with far more delicacy than they have most of the players in the struggle.</p>
        <p>That was clear in Mrs. Clinton's speech Friday in Philadelphia: "We're confusing the fact that we have the finest physicians and hospitals in the world with the fact that we have the stupidest financing system for health care in the world," she said, going on to blast insurance companies and the drug industry. After all, an insurance executive is rarely the subject of a TV series or a fond memory from a grandparent. The cult of the doctor may not be what it was, but it still endures.</p>
