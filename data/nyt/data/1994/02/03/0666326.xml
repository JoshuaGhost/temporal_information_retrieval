        <p>The release by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of his preliminary spending plan is the opening of a five-month process by which the New York City government determines its budget for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The plan, which is required by the City Charter, gives projections of spending and revenue for the next four years, but its details focus primarily on the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Members of the Giuliani administration, including budget officials and agency heads, will meet with City Council committees over the next month to discuss details of their initial proposal. Mr. Giuliani and some of his aides will also meet, no doubt, with state legislative leaders over the next two months, seeking more aid to the city in the state's spending plan, which by law is to be completed by April 1.</p>

        <p>The release by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of his preliminary spending plan is the opening of a five-month process by which the New York City government determines its budget for the next fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The plan, which is required by the City Charter, gives projections of spending and revenue for the next four years, but its details focus primarily on the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Members of the Giuliani administration, including budget officials and agency heads, will meet with City Council committees over the next month to discuss details of their initial proposal. Mr. Giuliani and some of his aides will also meet, no doubt, with state legislative leaders over the next two months, seeking more aid to the city in the state's spending plan, which by law is to be completed by April 1.</p>
        <p>Then, in late April or early May, the Mayor will propose his final spending plan, called the executive budget. That plan will take into account any new state aid and the reaction to his preliminary plan, as well as changes in the city's revenue and spending estimates during the first five months of the year. It then goes to the Council for a second round of committee hearings.</p>
        <p>Finally, in early June, the Mayor and the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, will begin serious negotiations on the final details of the budget. These private talks can last for days and sometimes for a week or more, and they are followed by a final vote by the full Council.</p>
