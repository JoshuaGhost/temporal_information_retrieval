        <p>NEW YORK CITY</p>
        <p>HOSPITAL PROJECT IS CALLED A FAILURE</p>
        <p>Charging a decade of mismanagement, the new chairman of New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation said that his agency had "completely screwed up" the planned reconstruction of Kings County Hospital. A1.</p>
        <p>WAY IS CLEARED FOR A NEW SUBWAY LINK</p>
        <p>The Federal Government cleared the way for a new subway link between Manhattan and Queens lines that would allow thousands more trips a day across the East River. A1.</p>
        <p>BOMB MANUALS ARE FOCUS IN BLAST TRIAL</p>
        <p>The lawyer for one defendant in the World Trade Center bombing trial showed the jury how easy it is in this country to obtain booklets and videotapes on bombs and bomb making. B2.</p>
        <p>MEMO ON WELFARE IS PLAYED DOWN</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani sought to distance himself from a memorandum written by one of his senior deputies that suggested that welfare recipients should clean up highways and parks as a condition of receiving benefits. B3.</p>
        <p>SCHOOL DISTRICTS ASSAILED ON SPENDING</p>
        <p>A City Council panel accused local school districts of excessive spending on meals, conferences and travel for school board members. B3.</p>

        <p>Tenants in five low-income Manhattan apartment buildings are suing the New York Housing Authority, demanding that the agency provide them with adequate heat and hot water. B5.</p>
        <p>A former spokesman for the Nation of Islam who was rebuked by the group's leader, Minister Louis Farrakhan, insisted that he remained in Mr. Farrakhan's good graces. B4.  REGION</p>
        <p>COURT UPHOLDS MURDER CHARGE</p>
        <p>Upholding a major exception to New York State's double jeopardy law, the state's highest court ruled that a person who has pleaded guilty to attempted murder may be charged with murder if the victim later dies. B6.</p>
        <p>NOBODY SHOOTS A LAME DUCK</p>
        <p>Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut said he would roar through his last year in office like "something coming out of 'Jurassic Park.'
