        <p>A California court has ordered C &amp; C Beauty Sales Inc., a Miami-based importer, to pay Parfums Givenchy Inc. about $112,000 in damages for copyright infringement caused when it sold Givenchy's Amarige perfume without the company's permission.</p>
        <p>Last year, Parfums Givenchy, the United States arm of the French fragrance and cosmetics company, pioneered the use of copyright law to protect brand-name luxury products from distribution in discount stores and other unauthorized outlets, a practice called diversion. It copyrighted the opulent box in which Amarige is packaged and began suing distributors and retailers for, in effect, selling the box without Givenchy's permission.</p>

        <p>Last year, Parfums Givenchy, the United States arm of the French fragrance and cosmetics company, pioneered the use of copyright law to protect brand-name luxury products from distribution in discount stores and other unauthorized outlets, a practice called diversion. It copyrighted the opulent box in which Amarige is packaged and began suing distributors and retailers for, in effect, selling the box without Givenchy's permission.</p>
        <p>Givenchy brought a similar suit against Drug Emporium Inc., a discount drugstore chain that was one of C &amp; C's customers. Judge Mariana R. Pfaezler ruled in Givenchy's favor in that case, which is currently under appeal in the Ninth Circuit Court. "Awarding damages gives her original decision a lot of teeth, which should send a message to those people who traffic in diverted goods," said Robert L. Brady, president of Parfums Givenchy.</p>
