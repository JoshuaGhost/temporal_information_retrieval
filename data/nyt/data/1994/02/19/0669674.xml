        <p>Tokyo String Quartet  With Marilyn Horne Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>The Tokyo String Quartet's Wednesday night concert inspired two topics for speculation: first, elegance as profit and loss, and second, the human voice as chamber-music instrument. Before intermission came two different works played much the same way. Haydn's "Lark" Quartet, with its deceptive naivete and startling harmony, invited the kind of sophisticated sound the Tokyo is so good at making. The finale tempts musicians toward intemperate speed, but these players held measured tempos in satisfying control.</p>
        <p>Dvorak's "American" Quartet, although a European impression of a country's spirit, is filled with the impetuosity of its subject matter. Written in a bare few weeks during a summer in Iowa, the music thrives on enthusiasm that barely stops to think. The Tokyo made it coolly elegant; the notes and rhythms sounded eminently familiar, but the piece itself was different.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Horne appeared after intermission in Barber's "Dover Beach" and "Il Tramonte" by Respighi. When quartets augment their numbers, the additions are usually to the lower instruments. Here was no viola, cello or double bass, but Ms. Horne's mezzo-soprano voice. Matthew Arnold's famous poem has been intelligently musicalized, while Respighi's Italian translation from Shelley wraps bleak pictures in luxuriant, sighing impressionism. Ms. Horne used her assets effectively.  BERNARD HOLLAND</p>
