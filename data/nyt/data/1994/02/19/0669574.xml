        <p>On Wednesday, a woman told the police that a laughing man put a gun to her 2-year-old daughter's head and robbed her at a Valley Stream, L.I., automated teller machine. Yesterday, the police said it never happened.</p>
        <p>Mary Rose Posner, 28, of Valley Stream was arrested yesterday and charged with filing a false police report. Ms. Posner, who was released and told to return to court on March 3, faces a maximum sentence of a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.</p>
        <p>"She wanted some attention," said Officer Bill Bendel, a spokesman for the Nassau County police. "There has been some discussion as to her being a bit lonely." 'It Wasn't Adding Up'</p>
        <p>Elements of Ms. Posner's story began to draw investigators' suspicion on Thursday, Officer Bendel said, and "They brought her in for questioning this afternoon, because it wasn't adding up."</p>
        <p>She had said that at 7:52 A.M., when she withdrew $200 at the gunman's command, no one else was near the Chemical Bank automatic teller machine on Merrick Road. After some investigation, "It seemed highly unlikely that she could have been there all by herself at that time," Officer Bendel said.</p>
        <p>Most important, he said, a check of the machine's records showed that a man had used it just four minutes before Ms. Posner. He said that when detectives interviewed the man, he said he had not immediately left the area of the automatic teller machine, and had seen no sign of the crime or the robber. Widely Publicized</p>
        <p>In a region where thousands of robberies go largely unnoticed, the horrific details of Ms. Posner's story brought considerable attention from the police, who held a press conference on the day of the reputed robbery, and from the press.</p>
        <p>"She wanted it to be dramatic," Officer Bendel said. "It was very believable."</p>
        <p>Ms. Posner told investigators that the robber was a young black man who, after taking her money, ran to a waiting silver Toyota, in which there were three other man, and then sped off.</p>
        <p>Investigators did not get to the point of identifying anyone as a suspect, Officer Bendel said, "But we had everyone out looking for a silver Toyota."</p>
