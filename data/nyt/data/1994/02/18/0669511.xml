        <p>While other cross-country skiers are spending their Olympics chasing Lyubov Yegorova, the Russian is spending hers chasing the ghosts of Olympics past.</p>
        <p>After winning her fourth career gold medal on Tuesday in the 5-kilometer classical event, Yegorova held off a late rush today from Manuela Di Centa of Italy to win the fifth gold of her career, in the 10-kilometer pursuit.</p>
        <p>"I simply know and simply show what I can do," Yegorova said. "This is what medals mean." Doing It Faster</p>
        <p>Today's gutsy performance means Yegorova now has an excellent chance of equaling the Winter Games records for gold medals and total career medals for men or women before she leaves Lillehammer.</p>
        <p>Lidiya Skoblikova, a Soviet speed skater who competed in 1960 and 1964, holds the career record for golds with six. Raisa Smetanina, one of Yegorova's former Soviet cross-country teammates, holds the record for total medals with 10.</p>
        <p>But while Smetanina needed five Winter Games to acquire that many, Yegorova has needed only two Winter Games to move within striking distance. The 27-year-old from St. Petersburg who once dreamed of being a ballerina has now participated in eight Olympic events and won medals in all eight, including two golds and a silver in Norway.</p>
        <p>The career medals record for either a Winter or Summer Games is 18 by Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina from 1956-64.</p>
        <p>"Yegorova is a stud," said Nina Kemppel, an American cross-country skier who finished 31st today. "She doesn't necessarily ski with the most beautiful technique like the Norwegians. What she is is tough. When it gets difficult out there, she pushes herself like nobody else."</p>
        <p>Yegorova is virtually guaranteed of a ninth medal in Monday's 20-kilometer relay, which the Russian team is a heavy favorite to win. All she then would need to catch Smetanina would be a medal in the final women's race, the 30-kilometer classical, on Feb. 24.</p>
        <p>The skier with the best chance of blocking her path to gold remains Di Centa, the lively 31-year-old from northern Italy who came to Norway without any individual medals and now has one gold and two silvers.</p>
        <p>Today, she started the pursuit 19 seconds behind Yegorova, and after two kilometers, the Russian had added seven seconds to her lead. But Di Centa is in the shape of her life, and she steadily cut into Yegorova's lead. The final gap was only 8.3 seconds.</p>
        <p>"Of course, I was worried," Yegorova said. "But I felt I could hold up rhythm, and I felt I could win. With two kilometers to go, I was confident I could win." Prefers It Warm</p>
        <p>The bronze medal went to Di Centa's more celebrated teammate, Stefania Belmondo, who started in 13th position but moved up 10 places by recording the fastest time of the day. Belmondo, who won a gold, silver and bronze in the 1992 Games, said the brutally cold temperatures in the first two races here had hurt her considerably.</p>
        <p>"It wasn't that cold, so I was much better today," she said.</p>
        <p>Clearly, it will take more than a change in the weather to slow down Yegorova.  WINTER OLYMPICS</p>
