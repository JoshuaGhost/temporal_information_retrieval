        <p>Maria St. Just, an actress and longtime friend of Tennessee Williams, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was in her late 60's or early 70's, her family said.</p>
        <p>The cause was heart failure brought on by severe rheumatoid arthritis, said her daughter Natasha Grenfell.</p>
        <p>Lady St. Just was born in Petrograd but was taken by her mother to London when she was an infant. Her father, a doctor, remained in the Soviet Union and was later executed. She studied ballet as a young girl, but a leg operation when she was 14 put an end to her plans for a dancing career.</p>
        <p>She won a scholarship to study at the Old Vic, after which she joined John Gielgud's company.</p>
        <p>In 1948, before the company embarked on a foreign tour, she attended a party given by Mr. Gielgud in honor of Williams. A lifelong friendship with the playwright ensued. Lady St. Just was a co-executor of Williams's estate, and in 1990 she published "Five O'Clock Angel: Letters of Tennessee Williams to Maria St. Just, 1948-1982" (Alfred A. Knopf).</p>
        <p>She appeared in the film "Room With a View" (1985) and in "Maurice" (1987), which was filmed at her estate near Salisbury.</p>
        <p>In 1956 she married Peter Grenfell, the son of a British partner of J. P. Morgan. In 1973 Grenfell became a peer. He died in 1984.</p>
        <p>In addition to her daughter Natasha, of London, she is survived by another daughter, Pulcheria, of Orleans, France, and two granddaughters.</p>
