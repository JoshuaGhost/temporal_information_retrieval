        <p>Two former executives of Young &amp; Rubicam London have been officially appointed to top positions at Lowe Howard-Spink in London. Lowe's parent, the Lowe Group, had lured them away in December, but their contracts with Y.&amp; R. had kept them from joining their new agency.</p>
        <p>Jerry Judge, 43, was named chief executive, and Tim Lindsay, 38, was named managing director; they previously held similar positions at Y.&amp; R. London. Mr. Judge succeeds David Jones, 46, who was promoted to the new position of chief executive at Lowe Group Europe. Mr. Lindsay succeeds David Wheldon, who left to become director of advertising at the Coca-Cola Company, an important Lowe client. Also, Adrian Holmes, 40, the chairman of Lowe Howard-Spink, was named to the additional new position of chief creative officer at Lowe Group Europe.</p>
