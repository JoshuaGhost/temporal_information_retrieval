        <p>Japan's Government pulled itself back from the brink last week by passing landmark political reform legislation after a bitter five-year struggle, but the success only cleared the way for a battle on a potentially even more complex and divisive issue -- reviving the economy.</p>
        <p>Some top Cabinet members have already clashed over the matter, with the Prime Minister scolding his chief Cabinet secretary in public on Monday in a dispute over tax policy.</p>
        <p>Adding to the problems is the fact that the Clinton Administration has taken sides, making it clear that it favors strong action from Tokyo to pull the economy out of its worst recession in the postwar era. A recovery would be likely to reduce Japan's trade surplus, which has soared to record levels in the last two years, straining Tokyo's relations with Washington. Heading for Washington</p>
        <p>With Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa scheduled to meet President Clinton in Washington on Feb. 11, and trade likely to dominate their talks, there is a great sense of urgency to the debate that is expected to unfold over the next 10 days.</p>
        <p>While the list of difficulties is a long one, the stock market expressed its delight that at least the Government was finally addressing the economic slowdown after months of neglect.</p>
        <p>In the first two days of the week, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks jumped a total of 1,658.46 points, or 8.8 percent. Monday's gain for the Nikkei was its fourth-highest on record in terms of percentage, an extraordinary rise of 1,471.24 points, or 7.84 percent, to 20,229.12. Some profit taking set in today, traders said, and the Nikkei closed down 166.31 points, or about eight tenths of 1 percent, at 20,250.03.</p>
        <p>The Government has lost no time in setting out the battle lines. Nearly everyone agrees that a huge emergency package of tax cuts and public- works spending is required. The news media have been filled with reports that the total package could amount to as much as 16 trillion yen, the equivalent of $146 billion -- which would come on top of $260 billion of similar emergency packages enacted over the last 18 months.</p>
        <p>But there is little agreement yet on how to finance such a package. The more conservative members of Mr. Hosokawa's coalition Government have insisted that any income tax cut must be offset by an increase in the 3 percent national sales tax, perhaps after a delay of a year or so.  Behind this approach is a fear of running up large Government budget deficits, a concern that is prevalent at the Finance Ministry.</p>
        <p>The Socialists, the largest party in the coalition, have insisted that a big sales tax increase would fall disproportionately on salaried workers, and that the Government should just incur a deficit to be covered by the sale of bonds.</p>
        <p>The United States has said there should be no increase in the sales tax, or at least not an immediate increase, because that would all but negate the benefits of the income tax reduction. The Americans say that since the Japanese Government has been running budget surpluses in recent years, there is plenty of room to use deficit spending to stimulate the economy.</p>
        <p>The Finance Ministry issued a lengthy statement to foreign reporters on Monday to counter Washington's arguments, point by point.  Reworking the Numbers</p>
        <p>It argued, for instance, that Japan only had a budget surplus if contributions to its social security fund were added in -- something the United States Government does not do in its accounting. Without those funds, Japan actually has a proportionally larger budget deficit than the United States, the ministry said.</p>
        <p>Japan's deficit will equal 5.5 percent of the gross domestic product this year, the ministry said, compared with 3.6 percent in the United States.</p>
        <p>"They don't appreciate the extent of the deterioration of Japan's fiscal balance," a senior ministry official said, referring to American officials.</p>
        <p>The official, who insisted on anonymity, acknowledged that the ministry had been wrong in its forecast that the economy would begin to recover last spring or summer.</p>
        <p>But, he said, in a sort of trial run of what the Government was likely to be explaining to President Clinton on Feb. 11, the fiscal package being discussed should be sufficient to finally get economic growth back on track.</p>
