        <p>WHEN, three weeks ago, this column took account of Gerry Frank, an Oregonian author of a guide to New York City, and quoted his authenticating claim that good egg creams were available at Moisha's Luncheonette at 239 Grand Street, 15 readers wrote to say that Moisha's was defunct and had been replaced by a Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>"You can get great egg drop there, not egg creams," wrote one man who, like the other correspondents, revealed nostalgia for the luncheonette while lamenting the decline and increasing unavailability of egg creams. Clearly such a response demanded contemplative reflection. Had the passage of candy stores and soda fountains driven a distinctive nectar, a once cherished local staple, to the verge of extinction? Was the egg cream, like stickball, like Checker cabs, a lapsing aspect of city culture? If so, should we care?</p>

        <p>WHEN, three weeks ago, this column took account of Gerry Frank, an Oregonian author of a guide to New York City, and quoted his authenticating claim that good egg creams were available at Moisha's Luncheonette at 239 Grand Street, 15 readers wrote to say that Moisha's was defunct and had been replaced by a Chinese restaurant.</p>
        <p>"You can get great egg drop there, not egg creams," wrote one man who, like the other correspondents, revealed nostalgia for the luncheonette while lamenting the decline and increasing unavailability of egg creams. Clearly such a response demanded contemplative reflection. Had the passage of candy stores and soda fountains driven a distinctive nectar, a once cherished local staple, to the verge of extinction? Was the egg cream, like stickball, like Checker cabs, a lapsing aspect of city culture? If so, should we care?</p>
        <p>For the benefit of outlanders and those raised in the era of canned sodas and designer waters, egg creams are drinks made from milk, soda water and syrup that were widely concocted and dispensed at neighborhood centers called candy stores. Stickball, by the way, was a game played in the middle of the street with a broom-handle bat and a pink rubber ball known as a spaldeen, and Checker cabs were roomy taxis.</p>
        <p>There are no eggs in egg creams and usually no cream. The name comes either from the drink's foamy head, which resembles beaten egg whites, or it is a corruption of the French "eau creme," meaning creamed water. Nobody knows for sure. What is certain is that for much of this century into the 60's, egg creams were a New York specialty.</p>
        <p>While people in Chicago drank black cows, which are scoops of ice cream in root beer, and Bostonians drank phosphates and frappes, which are sodas and milkshakes, New Yorkers had their egg creams. Until recent times no New Yorker was ever far from an egg cream, and teen-agers argued over which store made the best ones.</p>
        <p>But that was then. What now?</p>
        <p>It turns out that the egg cream, though in decline, is not quite dead. It turns out that as soda fountains vanish, egg creams are coming back. It turns out that at this moment egg creams are bottled and distributed throughout the country as "Jeff's Amazing New York Egg Cream."</p>
        <p>The Jeff of the bottled egg cream is Jeff Glotzer, a 42-year-old Brooklyn native whose company, Egg Cream America, maintains offices at 114 East 32d Street. There, surrounded by bottles of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and coffee egg creams, both diet and regular, Mr. Glotzer explained his vision and his mission.</p>
        <p>"I grew up in the Midwood section of Brooklyn," he said. "I drank egg creams at Benny's, the Paradise, dozens of places. Then I went to the University of New Mexico to study anthropology. They did not have egg creams in Albuquerque. When I came back after graduation Benny's and the other places were gone. It was hard to find an egg cream. I had some ideas about commercializing egg creams, but I went into the export business."</p>
        <p>But in the late 80's Mr. Glotzer returned to his old ideas. "I learned that no one had ever succeeded in carbonating milk. That was the big hurdle. I hired a beverage chemist. It took a long time but he came up with our process. What is it? It's a secret like Coca-Cola's. Who was the chemist? He's a very modest man and would not want me to reveal his name."</p>
        <p>Mr. Glotzer, who is not all that modest himself, designed the label putting his own mustached face on every 10-ounce bottle. "Why not? If there's a real Ben and Jerry behind Ben and Jerry's, a real Amos behind Famous Amos, why not a real Jeff?" he said, continuing his story.</p>
        <p>"We started selling at the end of 1990," he said. "We basically had three target areas, New York, Florida and California. But pretty soon we got included in the Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue. They offer a case of 24 bottles for about $30. Bloomingdale's also started carrying the line. Now we are distributing in 31 states. In Nebraska the favorite flavor is strawberry."</p>
        <p>"We are selling in North Dakota, Texas, Alaska," Mr. Glotzer said, adding that Jeff's Amazing New York Egg Cream is available in several grocery chains in the New York area. Last month the company started advertising on the back of some city buses that exhort, "Get Creamed."</p>
        <p>So what's the prognosis? Will the egg cream, so long a moribund and flagging taste, rise to fizz again? Will it emerge, years after its golden age, to slake thirsts far and wide? Will it follow the proliferation and cultural diffusion of the bagel?</p>
        <p>Who knows? But when you ask Jeff Glotzer, the visionary founder of Jeff's Amazing New York Egg Cream, he looks you straight in the eye and says, "Why not?"  ABOUT NEW YORK</p>
