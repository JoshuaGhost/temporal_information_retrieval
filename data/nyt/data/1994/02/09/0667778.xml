        <p>Islanders 3, Sabres 1</p>
        <p>Playing before only 2,966 fans, the smallest home crowd in franchise history, the Islanders beat the Buffalo Sabres, 3-1, at Nassau Coliseum last night.</p>
        <p>Fans with tickets who were not able to get to the game because of the snow will receive tickets for a future date.</p>
        <p>"I thought for a while they would cancel it, but with both teams and the officials here, they made a go of it," said Uwe Krupp of the Islanders. "You have to give the fans credit for showing up in weather like this."</p>
        <p>Teammate Derek King added: "I've never seen so many extra tickets in the dressing room. It was hard to get people to come."</p>
        <p>Fans were allowed to park free, saving them the usual $4.25. On their way out, programs were given away.</p>
        <p>"These are the staunch Islander fans," New York goalie Ron Hextall said. "The car is not where you want to be on a day like today."</p>
        <p>Buffalo has not won in its last five visits (0-4-1) to the coliseum, dating to Oct. 20, 1990. But it was only the Sabres' second loss in eight games over all.</p>
        <p>It was the Islanders' third victory in their last five games (3-1-1). Patrick Flatley put them ahead, 2-1, at 1 minute 49 seconds of the third period. The goal was confirmed after officials checked a video replay.</p>
        <p>Steve Thomas made it 3-1 with a power-play rebound goal at 13:03.</p>
        <p>Goalie Jamie McLennan, a rookie, stopped 26 shots for the Islanders. Grant Fuhr made only his second start in goal for Buffalo since Nov. 24, and made 33 saves, many of them difficult.</p>
        <p>Buffalo held a 30-minute closed door meeting after the game, and when it was over, Fuhr explained what went on behind closed doors.</p>
        <p>"When you don't play well, you expect to hear about it," Fuhr said. "Everybody had something to say, and we just have to get it together."</p>
        <p>Krupp was plenty happy with the win. "It was an awful game, a game where you can fall asleep," Krupp said of the game that lasted 2 hours 55 minutes. "With all the penalties, it was a slow game. There was no flow to it." Bruins 6, Nordiques 1</p>
        <p>Adam Oates scored three goals in the third period, with Cam Neely assisting on all three, to power the Boston Bruins to a rout of the Nordiques in Quebec.</p>
        <p>Oates was benched for much of the second period by Bruins Coach Brian Sutter. He responded by boosting the Bruins to a 3-1 lead 22 seconds into the third period, firing a slap shot past goaltender Jocelyn Thibault. Oates scored his second goal at 5:46 on a soft back-hander that dribbled between Thibault's legs. Oates completed his hat trick at 15:26, tipping in a pass from the corner by Neely. Senators 3, Flyers 3</p>
        <p>Vladimir Ruzicka scored on a power play with 2:47 left in the third period Tuesday night, giving the Ottawa Senators a 3-3 tie with visiting Philadelphia and ending the Flyers' team-record six-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>All three of Ottawa's goals came with an extra man. Philadelphia was held scoreless during four power plays, including one during the final two minutes of the game. Blues 6, Jets 5</p>
        <p>Brett Hull had a goal and two assists as the host St. Louis Blues built a four-goal lead and then hung on for a victory over the staggering Winnipeg Jets. The Jets are in an 0-8-2 slump and haven't won since Jan. 12, falling out of playoff contention without injured star Teemu Selanne. They've allowed 21 goals in the last four games and 226 over all, better only than Ottawa. Canucks 6, Red Wings 3</p>
        <p>Jimmy Carson scored twice and Cliff Ronning and Pavel Bure each had a goal and two assists as the Vancouver Canucks beat the Red Wings in Detroit.  HOCKEY</p>
