        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Both "Let Her Skate" (editorial, Jan. 30) and "Harding, the Games and Us" (Sports of The Times, Jan. 28) seem to have lost all perspective on the role of sports and sportsmanship in this country.</p>
        <p>It is true that Tonya Harding is entitled to due process protections, such as "beyond a reasonable doubt" and additional procedural protections in the context of a criminal prosecution, where criminal sanctions, including prison, are a possible outcome. But that is not the issue facing the United States Olympic Committee in deciding whether or not to allow the figure skater to represent the United States in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>Like many private sporting associations, such as the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League, the Olympic Committee sets standards of conduct to which athletes must conform if they are to compete. Internal procedures are, of course, necessary to assure that those systems of private rules are administered fairly and that there is an opportunity for an athlete to explain his or her behavior. But the substantive standard applied says something about the expectations and ideals the athletes as members of that organization set for themselves.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harding has now given a press conference and acknowledges that she learned about the attack on a fellow competitor and yet did nothing. Indeed, there is some evidence to suggest that she may have even been more directly involved.</p>
        <p>The Olympic Committee owes to itself and to other Olympic athletes an uncompromising statement that neither the Olympic Games nor the United States condones conduct of this sort. Sufficient culpability or proof to send Tonya Harding to jail is not the issue; the issue is whether or not she is a worthy participant in an international competition with noble traditions. LINDA SILBERMAN  Prof. of Law, New York University New York, Jan. 31, 1994</p>
