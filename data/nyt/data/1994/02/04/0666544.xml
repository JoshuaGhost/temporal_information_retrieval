        <p>Chambers's Drums</p>
        <p>Joe Chambers, Birdland, 2745 Broadway, at 105th Street, (212) 749-2228. Joe Chambers is one of the best drummers jazz has, a living reminder of how well some musicians, during the 1960's, incorporated experimentalism in their playing. And as a composer, he writes music that never seems quite settled, just the sort to force his musicians to think before they play. He's leading a quartet that features the ever-improving Antonio Hart on saxophone. Shows tonight and tomorrow night are at 9, 10:30 and 12. There is a $10 cover and a $10 minimum. PETER WATROUS Zairian Sounds</p>
        <p>Tabu Ley Rochereau, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. This great Zairian singer is a real treat to hear. He'll croon some, but more than anything he'll engage the whirling guitars of his band. He leads one of the dance world's best groups, a 13-member orchestra that's meant to keep people going and happy all night long. The two shows tomorrow night are at 11 and 1 A.M.; there is a $16 cover. P. W. Radio Stories</p>
        <p>Duplex Planet Radio Hour, Church of St. Anne and the Holy Trinity, corner of Clinton and Montague Streets, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 858-2424. David Greenberger, the host of the show, collected reams of interviews with the residents of a nursing home where he worked. The content ranges from the surreal to the measured, and Mr. Greenberger reads them blandly, letting the words and ideas pop and crackle with humor. The music is provided by the pianist Terry Adams, of the group NRBQ, and he'll be joined by a quartet. The show is on Sunday at 7 P.M. Tickets are $15 for reserved seats, $13 for general admission.
