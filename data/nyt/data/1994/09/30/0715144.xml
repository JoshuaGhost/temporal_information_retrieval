        <p>Authorities in New Delhi closed schools, colleges and movie theaters here in response to concern about the possible outbreak of bubonic or pneumonic plague in the capital.</p>
        <p>The Health Minister of the state of New Delhi, Harsh Vardhan, said that the closings were "precautionary" and that they would remain in effect at least until next week.</p>
        <p>A senior official of the World Health Organization was quoted as saying here tonight that the pneumonic plague could be controlled in two or three weeks.</p>
        <p>The Press Trust of India said there were 51 deaths in the city of Surat, the hardest-hit area, and in two neighboring villages. Although no fatalities have been reported from other parts of India, the Press Trust said that 93 new cases of pneumonic plague had been reported in new areas of Surat in the last two days.</p>
        <p>Surat, a port and trading center, had a population of 2.7 million. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled since the first cases of plague were reported there last week, leading to fears that the refugees were carrying the virus to other parts of the country.</p>
        <p>At least 20 different cities and towns have reported cases of suspected plague, including each of the three largest cities, Bombay, New Delhi and Calcutta.</p>
        <p>The Reuters news agency reported that 18 of the 47 suspected plague victims in New Delhi were confirmed to have the disease. It said that 60 people were being treated for plague-like symptoms in Calcutta -- 950 miles northeast of Surat -- but that none had been confirmed as plague victims.</p>
        <p>News accounts from Surat said that the city's stores, banks and offices had begun to open.</p>
        <p>At least 1,200 cases of suspected plague have been reported in five states -- Gujarat, Maharashtra, New Delhi, Rajasthan in the Northwest and West Bengal to the east.</p>
        <p>The outbreak of plague has led several Arab nations to suspend flights to India, leaving many passengers stranded.</p>
