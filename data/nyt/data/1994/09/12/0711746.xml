        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Irish and British governments must now pointedly assure the unionist and nationalist communities that any political reform will be structured to improve the civil rights and economic prospects of all the people in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Reform is needed to end a bitter legacy. Northern Ireland was forcibly created to placate extremist British loyalists. Their philosophy of union with Britain is an abject failure politically and socially. It has rendered supporters and opponents alike into victims of a militarized, demoralized society. There is an alternative.</p>
        <p>The unionist community fears becoming a powerless minority within a reunited Ireland. But the Irish Republic can offer to establish a federal relationship with the North as part of a reunification accord.</p>
        <p>Under such an arrangement, voters in the six counties would elect a regional assembly and a political executive with full powers to govern on local issues. The assembly and the executive would not be supervised by Dublin, but they would have to comply with the provisions of the national Constitution -- especially its fundamental rights provisions. For now, a ray of hope has broken through for a land too long in the shadow of war.  DANIEL J. DONOVAN  Brooklyn, Sept. 6, 1994</p>
