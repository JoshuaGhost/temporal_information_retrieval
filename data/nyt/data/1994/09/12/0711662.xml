        <p>Senior Administration officials appeared today to disagree on Washington's plans for the future of Haiti's military leaders.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher seemed to leave open the possibility that the three leaders could lead normal lives in Haiti if they relinquished power voluntarily.

        <p>Senior Administration officials appeared today to disagree on Washington's plans for the future of Haiti's military leaders.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher seemed to leave open the possibility that the three leaders could lead normal lives in Haiti if they relinquished power voluntarily.  Asked on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" whether the leaders could remain in Haiti and even organize politically, Mr. Christopher said that the restored Government would have to decide.</p>
        <p>But Madeleine K. Albright, the American delegate to the United Nations, said today on the ABC News program "This Week" that Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the junta leader, Col. Michel Joseph Francois, the police commander, and Gen. Philippe Biamby, the army Chief of Staff, would have to leave Haiti to avoid an invasion.</p>
        <p>Later, Administration officials said that Mr. Christopher was speaking technically, saying that the three might physically remain in Haiti, but that they would risk prosecution.  They said that Ms. Albright had taken a more practical approach -- that the military leaders would be prosecuted or could risk death if they remained in Haiti.</p>

        <p>WARSHIPS OFF CAPITAL</p>
        <p>PORT-AU-PRINCE, Sept. 11 (Special to The New York Times) -- An American destroyer and two other ships steamed to within a mile of the Port-au-Prince waterfront Sunday afternoon in what was probably the strongest show of force by the United States in Haiti so far. But the warships turned around and went back beyond the three-mile limit they usually keep.</p>
