        <p>It was the quintessential Vail date. In a town where the skiing is the predominant social institution and dinner-and-a-movie evenings are rare, Mike Harvey invited his new flame, Lanell Avery, to compete on July 3 in the Vail Hill Climb, the annual 10-kilometer run that rises 3,000 grueling feet up the side of Vail Mountain. As usual, more than 600 residents, about a quarter of the town's permanent population, showed up to compete.</p>

        <p>It was the quintessential Vail date. In a town where the skiing is the predominant social institution and dinner-and-a-movie evenings are rare, Mike Harvey invited his new flame, Lanell Avery, to compete on July 3 in the Vail Hill Climb, the annual 10-kilometer run that rises 3,000 grueling feet up the side of Vail Mountain. As usual, more than 600 residents, about a quarter of the town's permanent population, showed up to compete.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey, 31, and his svelte companion jockeyed for a starting position at the front of the pack and began to jog.</p>
        <p>"I haven't run in this big of a crowd in years," Mr. Harvey, who was competing in the race for the first time, said.</p>
        <p>"The last time I did anything like this was the New York Marathon," Ms. Avery, a local entrepreneur, replied.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey gulped. The New York Marathon? Though he works as a sales manager at Vail's chic Cascade Athletic Club and considers himself something of a hardbody, he suddenly envisioned his worst nightmare: getting dusted by his date. Pumping up his pride, he finished the race at her side, though thoroughly winded.</p>
        <p>Romance is like everything else in this high-powered ski town. "If you can't keep up, don't bother showing up," said Kristen Coil, a resident whose choices in boyfriends lean heavily toward the toned and the fleet. "We work hard, we play hard and we party hard. A lot of people can't deal with that."</p>
        <p>Unlike rival ski towns like nearby Aspen, whose past as an old silver mining town is integral to its hip image, Vail remained a sleepy backwater until the ski resort's founding by Vail Associates in 1960. That group has turned a valley inhabited by sheepherders and lettuce growers into the largest ski resort in Colorado. Originally dubbed "Shake 'n Bake Bavaria" for the fake Alpine architecture the founders used to fabricate an ambiance, Vail now defines itself by the competitive zeal its residents bring to nearly everything they do.</p>
        <p>When the resort managers chose mountain biking as a way to attract more summer visitors, they immediately set about securing the sport's premier event, the World Mountain Bike Championships, which will begin on Tuesday and will continue through next Sunday on Vail Mountain. "Why go for the No. 2 event when we can go for No. 1?" said John Garnsey, who headed the campaign to secure the event for the Vail Valley Foundation, a private nonprofit group that promotes cultural and sports events. "Vailites want the best."</p>
        <p>Nowhere is Vail's competitive bent more evident than in the successful campaign to bring in the 1999 World Alpine Skiing Championships, which is second only to the Winter Olympics as the most important ski-racing event. Going head-to-head with its more formal European rivals at the site-selection conference last spring in Rio de Janeiro, the Vail contingent -- including everyone from the town's Mayor to Vail Associates' chairman -- filled a promotional booth with cowboy gear and went about wooing votes by offering tastes of medallions of elk and lessons in country-and-western line dancing. Organizers had already scored a public-relations coup last winter, when Hillary Rodham Clinton donned a Vail '99 jacket while attending the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.</p>
        <p>"We've always been very goal-oriented here," said Peter Seibert, 70, Vail Associates' founder. "And when you exude that, you draw more and more people who fit that personality type."</p>
        <p>To be sure, Vail has a history of attracting the powerful. The list of the resort's original partners reads like a Who's Who of American industry, including the chairmen of I.B.M., Kellogg's and Motorola. Their $10,000-apiece investment in 1960, which bought 2 acres of land, 100 shares of stock and 4 lifetime season ski passes, paid off: each stake is now worth more than $1 million.</p>
        <p>Of course, wealth begets wealth, and heavy hitters like Henry R. Kravis, the financier, and Peter A. Cohen, the former chairman and chief executive of Shearson Lehman Hutton, built lavish second homes here. And politicians like former President Gerald R. Ford, Ross Perot and Jack F. Kemp, who also have homes here, have found gushing support among Vail's conservative elite.</p>
        <p>"What Aspen is to Hollywood, Vail is to Wall Street," said Jerry Jones, who helped Vail's founders market the resort to a select group of newcomers.</p>
        <p>Even the ski bums who move here are Type A's. "The young guy who goes to Telluride or Crested Butte has probably heard so much from his old man about getting a job and succeeding that he just wants to go somewhere and hang out," Mr. Seibert said. "The guy who comes to Vail is a bit more career-oriented, at least in the back of his mind."</p>
        <p>And those who arrive here as ski bums often become infected with the entrepreneurial spirit. New businesses, many of which cater to Vail's rich and time-strapped second-home owners, seem to sprout like wildflowers, bolstering a local economy that's become one of the fastest-growing in the state.</p>
        <p>In Vail, ambition takes many forms. This, after all, is a town where more than 500 residents race in a highly competitive weekly mountain-bike series and dozens of superfit men and women juggle professional bike-racing careers in the summer and professional mogul skiing in winter.</p>
        <p>"The level of athleticism is unparalleled," said Davis Phinney, a bicylist who won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics. He now runs an annual summer cycling camp in Vail with his wife, Connie Carpenter, a bicyclist who won a gold medal in 1984. "I avoid the bike club's training rides because I know I'll get shellacked."</p>
        <p>Vail residents have even elevated relaxation to a competitive level. Members of the renowned Lawn Chair Drill Team handle lounge chairs with the same precision as soldiers handling rifles. "We'll challenge anyone to a competition," said Josh Hall, 40, who marched with the team in President Clinton's inaugural parade. "We've got muscles in places these all-American runners and skiers just can't imagine."</p>
        <p>Craig Campbell, the leader of the drill team, added: "In a regular town, the competition is over who has the biggest house or the best job. But here, it's all based around who's the best at recreating: who skis the most days or bikes the most miles. The drill team kind of fits right into that. We call it the 'Pro Leisure Tour,' and we get a lot of points for being on the team."</p>
        <p>Attendance at ski-conditioning classes each fall is worth big points, too, if you can survive. Led through a strenuous series of workout stations by a team of trainers and professional mogul skiers, enthusiasts at the Cascade Athletic Club drop like flies as the sessions stretch on. "It's like boot camp here," said Annegret Howe, a nutritionist at the Vail Valley Medical Center who quit the ski classes after a few weeks. "Between the power lunges, the plyometrics and the suicide sprints, you've got to be a superwoman just to keep up."</p>
        <p>And where does that leave the rest of the pack? Melodee Crawford, who manages the T. Lame clothing store, has found that Vail's hardbodies have little patience with laggards.</p>
        <p>"I was going out with this guy, but he dumped me after we went skiing," she said. "He told me: 'You've got the basics down, but you're just not good enough. So our relationship isn't going to last.' I was appalled."  OUT THERE</p>
