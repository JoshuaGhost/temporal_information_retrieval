        <p>To the Editor: Amy Engeler's article may have been more aptly titled "On an Ego Trip, Running Into Trouble."</p>
        <p>She speaks of her group of 16 "neophyte rafters" who exhibited varying degrees of optimism and bravado. Sadly, they did not exhibit common sense. The rapids she speaks of are designated Class 4 and 5 for a reason. These are not meant for beginners.  The rating system is not meant as a marketing ploy to lure unwitting city dwellers, but to rate the degree of difficulty in navigating.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Amy Engeler's article may have been more aptly titled "On an Ego Trip, Running Into Trouble."</p>
        <p>She speaks of her group of 16 "neophyte rafters" who exhibited varying degrees of optimism and bravado. Sadly, they did not exhibit common sense. The rapids she speaks of are designated Class 4 and 5 for a reason. These are not meant for beginners.  The rating system is not meant as a marketing ploy to lure unwitting city dwellers, but to rate the degree of difficulty in navigating.</p>
        <p>As is typical of our society today, when something goes wrong we look to place blame elsewhere, in this case on the outfitters who run these trips. They may be responsible for making clear the dangers, but I believe it is up to individuals to assess their abilities. MARY E. HASKELL  Ludlow, Vt. The author responds: Ms. Haskell should note that the participants in my group included many experienced outdoorsmen, among them a professional ice-skater and a tennis pro, who, with competent guidance, are the equal of demanding rapids. It seems reasonable to expect outfitters' guides to be responsible both for letting rafters know of potential danger and, more significant, for knowing each whirlpool, barely submerged rock and bend in the river before venturing out so they may direct the rafters away from constantly shifting dangers and not toward them.</p>
