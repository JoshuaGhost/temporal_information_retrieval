        <p>To the Editor: Like Amy Engeler, I too had a harrowing adventure on a Hudson River raft tour that took place about 10 years ago.</p>
        <p>At the end of a rather uneventful first day, as our group of eight was making camp on the riverbank, two rafts floated by. Our guide yelled to them that there was no safe landing place farther on that they could reach before dark, but their leader answered that they were only on a day trip and could make it to town.</p>
        <p>After we had built fires, eaten dinner and set up tents, our guide walked downstream on the bank. Below us he found both rafting parties covering themselves with leaves to keep warm in the 32-degree dark. One member, a man who had fallen overboard, was missing. Our guide led the rest of the party back to our camp.</p>
        <p>In the morning, some of us continued rafting, on the lookout for the missing man -- who was, to my knowledge, never found -- while others went to tell the police. What began for us as a simple, safe weekend outing had turned into a scene from "Deliverance." We had naively been assured by a brochure that danger was not part of the package.
