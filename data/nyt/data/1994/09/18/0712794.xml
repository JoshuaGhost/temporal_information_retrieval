        <p>READY?" asked Kurt Swanson. "Ready," said Lisa Schwartz, preparing to make a quicksilver maneuver with molten glass. Turning from the glory hole, a fiery oven used to reheat glass, Ms. Schwartz crossed to where Mr. Swanson, her husband and partner in Pinkwater Glass here, sat turning a glob of hot, clear glass attached to a tube. The rod she held had colored glass at the end, and now the two hot bubbles were melded together for further shaping into a bowl.</p>

        <p>READY?" asked Kurt Swanson. "Ready," said Lisa Schwartz, preparing to make a quicksilver maneuver with molten glass. Turning from the glory hole, a fiery oven used to reheat glass, Ms. Schwartz crossed to where Mr. Swanson, her husband and partner in Pinkwater Glass here, sat turning a glob of hot, clear glass attached to a tube. The rod she held had colored glass at the end, and now the two hot bubbles were melded together for further shaping into a bowl.</p>
        <p>The two have performed this motion hundreds of times in recent weeks as they prepared for the Westchester Craft Show, planned for next Saturday and Sunday at the County Center in White Plains. Whimsical and Colorful</p>
        <p>The couple were the only artists from the Westchester area selected for the juried show, which will feature the work of 110 fabric artists, metalworkers, jewelry and furniture designers and glass blowers from around the country. Seated in front of the furnace of the couple's shop in a big green barn, Mr. Swanson blew into the tube and continued to rotate the glass as it expanded, using tools to shape it.</p>
        <p>Everything has to be done quickly with glass before it loses heat, he said; at 1,500 degrees, Ms. Schwartz's colored glob was "almost too cold" to meld properly with his clear one.</p>
        <p>The furnace blazed fiercely as he opened the door. Inside were 100 pounds of glass at 2,100 degrees, he said, enough for a week's work. The couple, who met as graduate students at the Massachusetts College of Art in Boston, design vases, bowls, furniture and sculptural works that are known in the crafts world for their vibrant color and whimsey. Since establishing Pinkwater Glass 11 years ago, the artists have sold glass pieces to retail stores like Barney's, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. Their artwork is also included in the permanent collection of the American Craft Museum in Manhattan, the Renwick Museum in Washington and other institutions. A Laborious Task</p>
        <p>Exhibiting at craft shows is a laborious task, the couple said, so they only attend a few carefully picked ones each year. "It's so nice to have a local retail show of high quality," Ms. Schwartz said, referring to the County Center event. She said the couple would sell their work there for prices ranging from as low as $30 to a high of $4,000 or $5,000.</p>
        <p>Crafts America of Westport, the show's producer, is best known for its success with the Washington Crafts Expo, held every year in Washington for the last seven years.</p>
        <p>Betsy Kubie, president of Crafts America, said she spent years searching for a New York location for the show and wants to make the White Plains exhibition an annual event. She said the artists, who are charged a booth fee and pay for their own expenses, are required to attend and receive all income from any sales.</p>
        <p>The exhibition was curated by a three-member jury and also includes such metal artists as Michael and Maureen Banner of Monterey, Mass., who make museum-quality silver teapots; Yvonne Arritt of McLean, Va., known for her silver spoons, and Peter Petrochko of Oxford, Conn., who fashions sculptural bowls.  Wooden Hats and Paper Vests</p>
        <p>Other artists take a humorous approach, Ms. Kubie said, observing the "tongue in cheek" furniture of Daniel Hale of Severna Park, Md.</p>
        <p>She said other unusual items included made-to-measure wooden hats by Johannes Michelsen of Manchester Center, Vt., which are "very lightweight, comfortable and fashionable"; and handmade paper vests by Donalyn Schofield of Shelburne Falls, Mass., which are meant to be hung as wall pieces.</p>
        <p>Admission to the show is $7. The hours are 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Saturday and 11 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Sunday.</p>
        <p>A preview party will be held at the County Center Friday from 6 to 9:30 P.M. to benefit the Westchester Philharmonic Education Scholarship Fund.</p>
        <p>Tickets to the party range from $35 to $75 and can be reserved by calling the Westchester Philharmonic at 682-3707. A brass quintet will provide music for the occasion.</p>
