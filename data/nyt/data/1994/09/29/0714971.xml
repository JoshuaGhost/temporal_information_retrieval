        <p>In a cordial, almost jocular atmosphere, President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin agreed today to speed destruction of nuclear weapons, but they made only limited progress on several other issues.</p>
        <p>"Relations between our nations are moving forward at full speed," Mr. Clinton said at a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House after the signing of documents pledging cooperation on economic and security matters.</p>
        <p>On most things, Mr. Yeltsin said, "for peace, for humanity, for mankind, for our whole planet, we have agreed."</p>
        <p>Two things made this, the fifth summit meeting between the two leaders, different from the others.</p>
        <p>First, the contentious questions today are small potatoes compared with those of the recent past, like arms control and the very survival of the Russian reformers. Second, Mr. Yeltsin appears to have regained his stride after having seemed off-balance for months following the attempt to oust him a year ago.</p>
        <p>The two leaders, burly extroverts who obviously enjoy each other, agreed to speed implementation of the Start II agreement, reached in 1993, which calls for the reduction of each nation's arsenal to between 3,000 and 3,500 long-range nuclear warheads by 2003. "Instead of taking the nine years allowed," Mr. Clinton said, dismantling will begin as soon as the accord is ratified.</p>
        <p>But Start II cannot be ratified until an earlier agreement, Start I, comes into effect. The Administration hopes that will happen by the end of the year and that ratification can be completed -- and dismantling can therefore get under way -- by mid-1995. Congressional approval seems sure; a struggle is expected in the Russian Parliament, but Mr. Yeltsin will probably prevail.</p>
        <p>Obviously delighted with what he had accomplished during two days in Washington, the Russian leader hammed it up with reporters, taunting them for falling behind. "You can't think fast enough?" he asked, stretching out his words to comic extremes. Mr. Clinton did not quite manage to keep a straight face.</p>
        <p>Earlier, at the Library of Congress, Mr. Yeltsin robustly rebutted those who have suggested recently that the United States and Russia will eventually come into conflict.</p>
        <p>"I would like to tell you," he said in his booming baritone, "that we never fought the United States, and I believe I can say as President of Russia that we will never fight the United States in the future. Instead, we will focus on building a world of decency and welfare."</p>
        <p>But on Bosnia, cooperation between the two nations is still imperfect, and only limited progress was made. A close adviser to Mr. Yeltsin said, "If it were easy, the thing would have been settled long ago."</p>
        <p>Russia, in part because of its cultural links to the Serbs, has long opposed the lifting of the international arms embargo against the former Yugoslavia, which would benefit the Muslim-led Government in Bosnia. The British and the French, who have peacekeepers in Bosnia, are also opposed. But under Congressional pressure, Mr. Clinton had pledged to ask the United Nations to lift the ban by Oct. 15.</p>
        <p>An open split was averted when the Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdzic, suggested a six-month delay in authorizing arms shipments.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed hope that some settlement could be reached during this period, but Mr. Yeltsin was blunt. After a meeting with United States Senators, he said that at the end of six months, "perhaps we can decide once and for all that this should not be done at all."</p>
        <p>On another vexing question, that of Russian arms shipments to Iran, Mr. Clinton said only, "We've made progress." In fact, American officials said, Mr. Clinton was not able to extract from Mr. Yeltsin any firm pledge to slow the flow of submarines, tanks and air-launched missiles, which amounted to more than $1 billion last year.</p>
        <p>The Russian leader said Russia would honor a contract signed with Iran in 1988 but would sign no new deals. But "we don't know how long or how wide the current pipeline is," an American expert said. Without that information, it is hard to say whether the Russian's new pledge has much significance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin also refused to budge much on Russian intervention in other nations of the former Soviet Union. Concerned about what might happen if Russian troops went into Nagorno-Karabakh, which is disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe has asked to monitor any intervention.</p>
        <p>So far Russia has balked, and Mr. Yeltsin showed no sign that he would yield. Instead he reasserted his claim to a Russian sphere of influence not unlike that which Washington claims in its hemisphere.</p>
        <p>"These are our neighbors," he insisted. "Yesterday we lived in the same house, in the Soviet Union. They're our blood, right? Come on, let's be honest."</p>
        <p>In the economic discussions, the emphasis was on American private investment, not American Government aid. The Russians promised to improve the laws governing business, which are so lax and change so often that most foreign business executives have shied away.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration, for its part, pledged $525 million in financing and insurance for new investments in Russia, and additional agreements are expected to raise the total to $1 billion.</p>
        <p>In the days when squabbles between the United States and the Soviet Union shook the world, American presidents encountering stormy political weather at home looked to summit talks for a bit of distraction. But this meeting was so low-key, so "normal," that Mr. Clinton, hard-pressed in the mid-term elections, can probably expect little in the way of direct obvious benefit.</p>
        <p>Still, the change in the relationship has been remarkable.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Clinton was in Moscow in January, he spent most of his time with Mr. Yeltsin, even though the political situation was confused, with reformers and pragmatists struggling for power. Some Russians and some diplomats complained, arguing that Mr. Clinton should have paid more attention to Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, an economic gradualist.</p>
        <p>All that seems like ancient history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin did not come with Mr. Yeltsin to Washington; he is required by the Constitution to stay at home when Mr. Yeltsin is out of the country. But the two have long since reached an understanding on the pace of economic reform, and Mr. Yeltsin praised his erstwhile rival this week.</p>
        <p>Several times he even used a very Chernomyrdin-like word -- pragmatism. Eight months ago that word would have upset American officials because it would have sounded like a signal that Mr. Yeltsin planned to ease reform measures as a concession to Russian nationalists.</p>
        <p>This week, none of the Americans who heard him batted an eye.</p>
