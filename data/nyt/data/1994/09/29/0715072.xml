        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The City of London's proposal (news article, Sept. 20) to bury the dead two to the plot to accommodate its overcrowded cemeteries may shock modern sensibilities, but reusable graves were commonplace in Europe from the high Middle Ages until at least the 17th century for those who could not afford a more permanent resting place in the floor of a church.</p>
        <p>Typically, the shrouded corpse was buried a few feet deep in the church's graveyard. After the flesh was consumed (which was said to take just nine days in the "miraculous" soil of the cemetery of the Church of the Holy Innocents in Paris), the bones were dug up and stacked in a charnel house or ossuary, a small enclosure or arcade attached to the church's wall. Sometimes bones were dumped down a hole cut into the church's wall.</p>
        <p>When parish sextons dug a grave, they regularly encountered and removed the remains of its previous occupant. Indeed, graves were dug so shallow and reused so often that scattered human bones were easily visible in many churchyards -- a sharp reminder of how familiar death and its trappings were to our ancestors and how queasy this inevitable event in life makes us now.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare vividly paints this funerary tradition in that famous scene from "Hamlet" (Act V, Scene i) where Hamlet and Horatio watch the clowning grave digger unearth three skulls, including, alas, poor Yorick, as he digs the hole for the dead Ophelia.
