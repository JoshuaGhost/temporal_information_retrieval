        <p>For her staging of "The Tempest," presented free by the Kings County Shakespeare Company at 8 nightly through Sunday in the Prospect Park Band Shell in Brooklyn, Deborah Wright Houston, the director, turns King Alonso, Sebastian, Trinculo and Ariel into women; as Miranda she casts a blind actress and as Gonzalo a mute actor who delivers his speeches by signing; and she fills the stage with half a dozen "spirits" who, although silent, seem to take control of the action.</p>
        <p>If the program did not mention that Maria Hansen is sightless, the audience might not notice. But the odd effect of the signing by Gonzalo (Matthew Hutton), with someone else translating his lines into speech, is to vastly inflate the role of this old wise man. That Naples has a Queen, not a King, hardly matters; and turning the drunken Stephano's sidekick into Trincula is inspired. Vicki Hirsch is very funny in this role.</p>

        <p>For her staging of "The Tempest," presented free by the Kings County Shakespeare Company at 8 nightly through Sunday in the Prospect Park Band Shell in Brooklyn, Deborah Wright Houston, the director, turns King Alonso, Sebastian, Trinculo and Ariel into women; as Miranda she casts a blind actress and as Gonzalo a mute actor who delivers his speeches by signing; and she fills the stage with half a dozen "spirits" who, although silent, seem to take control of the action.</p>
        <p>If the program did not mention that Maria Hansen is sightless, the audience might not notice. But the odd effect of the signing by Gonzalo (Matthew Hutton), with someone else translating his lines into speech, is to vastly inflate the role of this old wise man. That Naples has a Queen, not a King, hardly matters; and turning the drunken Stephano's sidekick into Trincula is inspired. Vicki Hirsch is very funny in this role.</p>
        <p>But those spirits are most intrusive: dancers in body stockings who swirl about the other characters constantly, often pushing or pulling them like so many mannequins. They turn the play into a kind of rambunctious ballet with speaking episodes, and after a while one wishes they would be like real-life spirits: invisible.</p>
        <p>Although most cuts made in the text here are innocuous, dropping almost all the songs turns the play from a dreamy, fanciful tale into a more somber work. But Ms. Houston's really serious innovation is to play down the romance of Miranda and Ferdinand and greatly magnify Prospero's dominance of all the other characters. This emphasis gives a somewhat puzzling political twist to the play.</p>
        <p>Altogether this is an energetic and often interesting "Tempest," even if it convinces one that Shakespeare's version is much better. THE TEMPEST  By William Shakespeare; directed by Deborah Wright Houston; movement and assistant director, Liz Shipman; production stage manager, Paul Marquis; composer, Peter Griggs; voice and verse consultant, Sandy Goodman; lighting by Athomas Goldberg; technical director, Kim Hanson; costumes by Renee Elizabeth Wright; props master and fight director, Lucie Chin. Presented by the Kings County Shakespeare Company. At the Prospect Park Band Shell, Prospect Park West and Third Street, Brooklyn.  WITH: Mark Schulte (Prospero), Matthew Hutton (Gonzalo), Bill Cohen (Stephano), Randy Aromando (Caliban), Maria Hansen (Miranda), Vicki Hirsch (Trincula) and Amy Schwartzman (Ariel).
