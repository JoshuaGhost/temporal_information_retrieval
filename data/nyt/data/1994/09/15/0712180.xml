        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that it had reached a final settlement of an insider trading case with the Southampton socialite Edward R. Downe Jr. that could total more than $11 million and leave him with nothing more than a few personal belongings.</p>
        <p>And in a rare display of social commentary, the S.E.C. declared Mr. Downe a financial and social has-been, portraying him in a press release as a "once prominent New York businessman and socialite."</p>
        <p>The case involved some of the most visible members of New York and Long Island society.</p>
        <p>Mr. Downe, a former director of Bear, Stearns &amp; Company and the former husband of Charlotte Ford, the automobile heiress, was sentenced to 3,000 hours of community service in September 1993, after pleading guilty to wire fraud and tax violations.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. said yesterday that he had exploited insider trading information and set up offshore bank accounts to hide millions of dollars of illegal profits for himself and members of his wealthy social circle.</p>
        <p>As part of the civil settlement approved yesterday by Judge Peter K. Leisure in the Federal District Court in Manhattan, the S.E.C. said Mr. Downe was ordered to pay $5,764,909 to compensate for his illegal trading profits and an additional $5,414,109 in interest.</p>
        <p>The commission said it would waive any civil penalty on the basis of Mr. Downe's claim that millions of dollars in legal fees had left him virtually bankrupt.</p>
        <p>As a result, lawyers familiar with the details of the case said, there is very little chance that the S.E.C. will collect anything close to $11 million from Mr. Downe.</p>
        <p>Still, the commission said a court-appointed lawyer, Bart M. Schwartz, would liquidate most of Mr. Downe's assets, including a summer mansion in Southampton, a condominium in Florida and an art collection, and recover any money that Mr. Downe might have set aside, "either intentionally or recklessly," to "hinder, delay or defraud the commission."</p>
        <p>The commission said Mr. Downe could keep the apartment he owns in Manhattan for the rest of his life, but it will go to the Federal Government on his death. He can also keep a car, clothing, some furniture and personal effects that the commission said had modest value, but nothing else.</p>
        <p>The civil settlement also bars Mr. Downe permanently from the working in securities industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Downe, who is 65, could not be reached for comment. His lawyer, Thomas P. Puccio, issued a statement confirming the settlement without giving the amount.</p>
        <p>The statement said, "Mr. Downe neither admitted nor denied any violations of the securities laws" and had "finally settled with the S.E.C. after incurring extensive legal costs for several years in order to devote his full attention to business pursuits."</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. charged in 1992 that during the mid- to late 1980's, Mr. Downe and a number of his friends and business associates had exchanged inside information to reap millions of dollars of profits through stock transactions carried out by Milton Weigner, a former senior broker at Oppenheimer &amp; Company who pleaded guilty to perjury in the case.</p>
        <p>Some of the accounts included those of Mrs. Ford, who recently divorced Mr. Downe, Leonard Lauder, president and chief executive of the Estee Lauder Companies, and Peter Duchin, the band leader.</p>
