        <p>Fox took over National Conference coverage from CBS, which had the rights for 38 years. Fox also beat NBC, which averaged a 12.4 overnight rating and 31 share for its coverage of American Conference games. NBC's overnight rating for 1 P.M. Eastern time games was up 16 percent from its opening Sunday rating last year. Both networks had the benefit of not having to compete with local baseball coverage in many markets.  PRO FOOTBALL</p>
