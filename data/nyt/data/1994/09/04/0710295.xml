        <p>The Miami Hurricanes won by 56-0 and improved to 58-0.</p>
        <p>Miami, ranked No. 6 by The Associated Press, routed Georgia Southern to break a National Collegiate Athletic Association record yesterday with its 58th consecutive victory at the Orange Bowl.

        <p>Miami 56, Georgia Southern 0</p>
        <p>The Miami Hurricanes won by 56-0 and improved to 58-0.</p>
        <p>Miami, ranked No. 6 by The Associated Press, routed Georgia Southern to break a National Collegiate Athletic Association record yesterday with its 58th consecutive victory at the Orange Bowl. The Hurricanes surpassed Alabama's record of 57 victories in a row at home set from 1962 to 1982.</p>
        <p>"We won this one for the fans," said Miami defensive end Rusty Medearis. "They're as much a part of the streak as the players. We thank them. This is something they can take home with them and enjoy."</p>
        <p>Stingy Miami allowed overmatched Georgia Southern 5 first downs and 54 total yards. The score equaled the most lopsided victory during the winning streak, which began nine years ago.</p>
        <p>James Stewart rushed for 145 yards and 3 touchdowns. He carried 17 times and scored on runs of 31, 16 and 2 yards. Alfred Shipman scored on an 82-yard run and finished with 130 yards on 5 carries. Frank Costa threw for 168 yards and 1 touchdown.</p>
        <p>Miami gained 627 yards over all and 415 rushing in the opener. Florida 70, New Mexico State 21</p>
        <p>Terry Dean showed why there's no quarterback controversy at Florida, the No. 1-ranked team in A.P. Dean tied an N.C.A.A. record with seven touchdown passes in the first half to lead the Gators over visiting New Mexico State.</p>
        <p>The fifth-year senior, who considered transferring when he lost his job to Danny Wuerffel last September, threw for touchdowns on seven of Florida's first eight possessions. Coach Steve Spurrier called on the third-stringer, Eric Kresser, to lead the last scoring drive of a 56-point half.</p>
        <p>Dean tied the record for touchdown throws in a half set by Dennis Shaw of San Diego State against New Mexico State in 1969. Dean, who completed 20 of 30 for 271 yards with no interceptions, broke his Southeastern Conference record of 6 set against Southwestern Louisiana last season.</p>
        <p>"He's got a chance to be the best quarterback I ever coached," Spurrier said, "and he played like it tonight." U.C.L.A. 25, Tennessee 23</p>
        <p>Wayne Cook passed for 295 yards and a touchdown and Bjorn Merten kicked four field goals as U.C.L.A., ranked No. 14 by A.P., held off No. 13 Tennessee at Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>The Volunteers, who lost their starting quarterback, Jerry Colquitt, when he injured his left knee on the game's seventh play, scored all their points in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough. The preliminary diagnosis was a torn anterior cruciate ligament, an injury that would probably sideline Colquitt for the year.</p>
        <p>Daron Washington's 30-yard touchdown run with 1 minute 34 seconds remaining made it 25-16 and clinched the victory for the Bruins. Tennessee's James Stewart scored on a 1-yard run with 10 seconds left.</p>
        <p>U.C.L.A. went ahead for good on its first possession when Cook, who was 25 of 38, teamed with Kevin Jordan on a 51-yard pass play, capping an 8-play, 90-yard drive. By that time, the Vols had already lost Colquitt. Southern Cal 24, Washington 17</p>
        <p>Shawn Walters ran for two second-half touchdowns, the last with 7:14 remaining, to lift Southern Cal, ranked No. 17 by A.P., over No. 23 Washington at Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Walters scored on a 3-yard run to snap a 17-17 tie after John Herpin intercepted a pass by Washington's Damon Huard at the Huskies' 34-yard line to set up the deciding score. Walters had pulled the Trojans even when he scored on a 7-yard run late in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>Southern Cal's victory overshadowed a 152-yard rushing performance by the Huskies' Napoleon Kaufman, who carried 26 times and scored on a 1-yard run. Penn State 56, Minnesota 3</p>
        <p>Kerry Collins passed for 260 yards, Ki-Jana Carter rushed for 210 and Penn State shut down Minnesota's vaunted passing attack as the Nittany Lions, ranked No. 9 by A.P., opened with a Big Ten victory in the Metrodome.</p>
        <p>Collins had 14 consecutive completions during one stretch, besting by 2 Bill Smaltz's 54-year-old school record. Collins finished 19 of 23, including touchdown passes to Freddie Scott, Keith Olsommer and Bobby Engram. Colorado 48, Northeast Louisiana 13</p>
        <p>Northeast Louisiana, the longtime Division I-AA power, was given a rude welcome in its jump to college football's elite division by Colorado, which is ranked No. 8 by A.P.</p>
        <p>Rashaan Salaam ran for 184 yards and 3 touchdowns as Colorado generated 649 yards of offense in the victory at Boulder, Colo. Alabama 42, Tennessee-Chattanooga 13</p>
        <p>Sherman Williams rushed for a career-high 153 yards, scoring 2 touchdowns, and host Alabama, ranked No. 11 by A.P., piled up 343 yards on the ground to cruise past Division I-AA Tennessee-Chattanooga.</p>
        <p>The Crimson Tide defense, which is supposed to rival Alabama's great unit of two years ago, surrendered two second-quarter touchdowns to the Moccasins. Auburn 22, Mississippi 17</p>
        <p>Stephen Davis emerged as another Auburn running back to be reckoned with, rushing for 158 yards and a touchdown as Auburn held off Mississippi in a Southeastern Conference opener at Oxford, Miss.</p>
        <p>Auburn, 11-0 last year while on N.C.A.A. probation and ranked No. 12 by A.P. this season, had to hold on as Ole Miss rallied in the second half. The Tigers extended Division I-A's longest winning streak to 12 games.</p>
        <p>Junior quarterback Patrick Nix threw for a touchdown and ran for one in his first start. With James Bostic, Auburn's leading rusher for the last two seasons, now in the National Football League, Davis got his first opportunity to showcase the talent that made him the national prep player of the year in high school. Georgia 24, South Carolina 21</p>
        <p>Eric Zeier passed for 485 yards and three touchdowns as Georgia got past South Carolina in a Southeastern Conference opener.</p>
        <p>Playing on an unusually cool night in Columbia, S.C., Zeier was 31 of 51 and bettered his league-leading 1993 average of 414 yards per game.  COLLEGE FOOTBALL: AROUND THE NATION</p>
