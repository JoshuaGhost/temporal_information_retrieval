        <p>President Clinton will be pushing "aggressively" for campaign finance and lobbying reform when Congress returns. So said Tony Coelho, the former California Congressman turned New York investment banker who is now calling the shots at the Democratic National Committee, in a television interview last week.</p>
        <p>As a House leader, Mr. Coelho helped teach the Democrats how to harvest money from political action committees and resigned his seat in 1990 under a cloud caused by a questionable investment. So he seems an unlikely choice to be speaking for the President on the stalled campaign finance and ethics legislation. But given the dilatory performance of his President and the Democrats in Congress, help from any quarter is welcome. Perhaps the energetic Mr. Coelho can move Mr. Clinton from crowd-pleasing talk to action.</p>

        <p>President Clinton will be pushing "aggressively" for campaign finance and lobbying reform when Congress returns. So said Tony Coelho, the former California Congressman turned New York investment banker who is now calling the shots at the Democratic National Committee, in a television interview last week.</p>
        <p>As a House leader, Mr. Coelho helped teach the Democrats how to harvest money from political action committees and resigned his seat in 1990 under a cloud caused by a questionable investment. So he seems an unlikely choice to be speaking for the President on the stalled campaign finance and ethics legislation. But given the dilatory performance of his President and the Democrats in Congress, help from any quarter is welcome. Perhaps the energetic Mr. Coelho can move Mr. Clinton from crowd-pleasing talk to action.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Coelho and Mr. Clinton want to make a real push for political reform, there is no mystery about whom to push -- House Speaker Thomas Foley, Richard Gephardt, the majority leader, and their fellow House Democrats. Thanks to their recalcitrance, and in the absence of any Presidential leadership, important legislation challenging Washington's influence-peddling and PAC addiction now languishes on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>More than a year has gone by since the Senate passed its campaign finance bill; the House approved its weaker version last November. Reconciling the two should have been simple. The story of why the two bills have not been reconciled is familiar to readers of this page. Both chambers are controlled by Democrats who had no problem delivering a reform measure two years ago, when assured of President Bush's veto. Yet negotiations are stalled because reform-fearing House Democrats want to maintain a $10,000 cap on the amount of money a member may accept from a single political action committee. This unreasonably high limit is destined to lose the votes of the seven swing Republicans needed to beat back a Republican-led filibuster in the Senate.</p>
        <p>House Democratic leaders also resist an end to their ability to collect even more special-interest money through personal "leadership" PAC's. And the Democrats would leave room for members to continue converting leftover campaign funds to personal use -- currently a widespread practice.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, negotiations are inching forward on the lobbying reform measures approved months ago by the House and Senate, but conference agreement on a final bill has yet to be reached. Both bills address the gifts that lobbyists drop on lawmakers to gain a legislative advantage. Again, the Senate bill does a more honest job. It would firmly ban free meals, entertainment and paid vacations from lobbyists and other special interests.</p>
        <p>Even if a strong lobbying-and-gift bill finally emerges, it will be no substitute for action on the larger issue of campaign financing. Lurking here is a danger that the Democrats may deliver on lobbying and gift reform, declare a big victory for ethics and then call it a day. So far, Mr. Clinton has been too busy helping the Democratic National Committee collect millions in soft money from wealthy contributors to provide leadership on the campaign financing legislation.</p>
        <p>All the dawdling has made a tough fight harder. Even in the present Congressional climate of heightened partisanship, there is a chance to overcome the expected Republican opposition in the Senate to any final campaign finance bill. But the first task is to overcome the obstructionism of House Democrats. When Congress gets back, Mr. Clinton, realistically, will have just days -- not weeks or months -- to save legislation that, after all, he promised to deliver.</p>
