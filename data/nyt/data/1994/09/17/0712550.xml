        <p>It is easy to imagine, during a Bargemusic concert of chamber music under the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn Heights, that you are actually sitting in a chamber: a living room, perhaps, with a low-slung but panoramic view of the financial ramparts of lower Manhattan. In fact, it is easy to imagine all sorts of things in the slightly giddy glow induced by the gentle rocking of the moored boat: might there, for example, be another group playing a Mozart trio on that fast-moving barge headed up the East River? (Oops! Suddenly the rocking is less gentle.)</p>
        <p>Well, O.K., so it was not always easy to keep the mind focused on Mozart's Piano Trio in C (K. 548). In current wisdom, hearing Mozart makes you smarter, as listeners were reminded by the cellist, Ronald Thomas; but perhaps not this piece, which is laid out from beginning to end for the piano, with the strings brought in as a mere afterthought.</p>

(Oops! Suddenly the rocking is less gentle.)</p>
        <p>Well, O.K., so it was not always easy to keep the mind focused on Mozart's Piano Trio in C (K. 548). In current wisdom, hearing Mozart makes you smarter, as listeners were reminded by the cellist, Ronald Thomas; but perhaps not this piece, which is laid out from beginning to end for the piano, with the strings brought in as a mere afterthought.</p>
        <p>The piano part is impressive, to be sure, and it was in excellent hands here once Randall Hodgkinson surmounted some early stiffness. But Carmit Zori, the violinist, seemed content with a halfhearted effort of her own, her intonation occasionally rocking with the waves.</p>
        <p>Ernest Chausson's little-known Piano Quartet in A (Op. 30) drew a more committed and cohesive response from all parties, now including Cynthia Phelps, the violist. Here Ms. Zori's slightly acidic edge kept the work's sweetness from growing sickly, and the three string players joined in a lovely sustained unison early in the second movement.</p>
        <p>But the finest performance of the evening came in the finest work: Schumann's "Marchenbilder" (Op. 113) for viola and piano. Ms. Phelps, who is the superb principal violist of the New York Philharmonic, is equally adept in chamber music, and she captured Schumann's glinting moods touchingly. Mr. Hodgkinson proved an eminently worthy partner in the full, rich piano part.</p>
        <p>The program is to be repeated on Sunday afternoon.  MUSIC REVIEW</p>
