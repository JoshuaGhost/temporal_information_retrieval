        <p>The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, proposed a $1.6 billion budget today that he said would hold county property taxes at their current level through next year.</p>
        <p>The budget includes money to hire more than 100 police officers, increasing the size of the county force to 2,701, the highest level since 1989, said Mr. Gaffney, a Republican in the third year of a four-year term.</p>

        <p>The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, proposed a $1.6 billion budget today that he said would hold county property taxes at their current level through next year.</p>
        <p>The budget includes money to hire more than 100 police officers, increasing the size of the county force to 2,701, the highest level since 1989, said Mr. Gaffney, a Republican in the third year of a four-year term.</p>
        <p>But he said the county would have to ask the State Legislature for permission to extend the part of the sales tax that expires at the end of 1995 to insure future financial stability.</p>
        <p>An added percentage point in taxes was approved in half-point increments in 1991 and 1992, producing revenues that allowed Mr. Gaffney to avoid major property tax increases while closing a budget deficit that exceeded $99 million three years ago.</p>
        <p>The 1 percent tax will produce $138 million in revenues in 1995, according to a projection released today.</p>
        <p>The Democratic leader of the county legislature, Maxine S. Postal, said Mr. Gaffney's claim that he was not raising taxes was "an absolute misrepresentation" because of continued dependence on the higher sales tax. "Whether it comes out of your left pocket or your right pocket, it's still taxes," Ms. Postal said.</p>
        <p>Suffolk retains 4.25 percent of the 8.5 percent sales tax collected in the county. The state gets 4 percent and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority gets a quarter of 1 percent. The combined rate is one of the highest in the nation and is matched only by Nassau County in the state.</p>
        <p>Sales tax revenues will rise 3.8 percent this year and 4.4 percent in 1995, the county executive's budget officials projected. Mr. Gaffney said the increased rates showed the county was "recovering slowly from the recession."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said the county had reduced the number of welfare recipients to 16,941 cases as of last month, from 18,600 cases in August 1993. He said this continued a downward trend at a time when other counties, including Nassau and Westchester, were reporting higher caseloads.</p>
        <p>He said the trend showed the success of a Suffolk program requiring able-bodied recipients to work in assigned jobs as a condition for receiving benefits. "People must understand that the rule in Suffolk County is if you can work, you must work," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said he was dropping a controversial plan to lease the county's fleet of some 8,000 cars from a Maryland company. He said he and county legislators were now discussing "a blend" of bought and leased cars to replace the aging fleet.</p>
        <p>In a public split with Mr. Gaffney, Republicans in the county legislature said the leasing plan would waste millions of dollars. Mr. Gaffney said he was forced to consider leasing because the legislators would not appropriate money or sell bonds to buy cars.</p>
        <p>Donald R. Blydenburgh, a Republican and the presiding officer of the 18-member legislature, declined today to comment on the proposed budget or on Mr. Gaffney's revised position on car leasing.</p>
