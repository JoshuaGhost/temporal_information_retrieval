        <p>SCIENTISTS have long known that insect species can hone their skills over evolutionary time to become expert at attacking a single species of plants. Now, in a series of new studies, researchers are finding that insects take their specializations to surprising extremes, becoming highly adapted to eating not just plants of a particular species but specific plants. So fine-tuned are these pests that they can fail to thrive even on plants of the same species growing as little as a few feet away from the one they are adapted to.</p>
        <p>The discovery of this evolution of eating preferences has helped explain the long-puzzling observation that some plants can be devastated by voracious insect pests while others of the same species, some close enough to have their branches entwined in their beleaguered neighbors', remain virtually untouched. Researchers say the studies also provide new insights into the evolutionary race between insect pests and the plants they attack, revealing both how quickly insects adapt to their hosts and how variable plants' defenses can be. At the same time, the new work has signaled the importance of maintaining heterogeneity in crops as a means of preventing pest outbreaks.</p>

        <p>The discovery of this evolution of eating preferences has helped explain the long-puzzling observation that some plants can be devastated by voracious insect pests while others of the same species, some close enough to have their branches entwined in their beleaguered neighbors', remain virtually untouched. Researchers say the studies also provide new insights into the evolutionary race between insect pests and the plants they attack, revealing both how quickly insects adapt to their hosts and how variable plants' defenses can be. At the same time, the new work has signaled the importance of maintaining heterogeneity in crops as a means of preventing pest outbreaks.</p>
        <p>"This is about as fine-scale as you can get in natural systems," said Dr. Susan Mopper, an insect ecologist at the University of Southwestern Louisiana in Lafayette. "These are examples of very rapid evolution and genetic differentiation. It is something that occurs within the life of the host plant, so it's an example of evolution almost right before our eyes."</p>
        <p>Dr. Sharon Y. Strauss, an ecologist at the University of California at Davis, said, "To think if you take a large step you might be looking at two entirely differentiated insect populations -- I think that was a pretty big surprise, that adaptation could result in differentiation even at these very small distances."</p>
        <p>So far, researchers have found moths, flies, scale insects and thrips that are adapted to eating particular plants, and some scientists think the phenomenon may turn out to be widespread.</p>
        <p>"Not many people have looked at this," said Dr. Tom Whitham, an ecologist at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. "We know so little about it." But, he added, he thinks it will be found in "an awful lot of organisms out there."</p>
        <p>The suggestion that insects could adapt to feast on individual host plants was first put forth almost 20 years ago in a groundbreaking paper by Dr. George F. Edmunds Jr., a retired biologist who was then a professor at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, and Dr. Donald Alstad, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. The researchers found that tiny insect pests of ponderosa pine, known as black pineleaf scale, seemed to thrive only on the tree from which they originated.</p>
        <p>The suggestion that these needle-sucking bugs could have adapted so quickly as to home in on an individual tree intrigued ecologists, who then went in search of more examples. But when early attempts to find similar specialization in other insects failed, the hypothesis of so-called "local adaptation" to individual host plants began to fall from favor.</p>
        <p>Most of the researchers involved in the new studies said they began their work expecting not to find support for the hypothesis. "I thought it would be the final nail in the coffin for the idea," said Dr. Larry Hanks, an insect ecologist at the University of California at Riverside who, with Dr. Robert Denno, an ecologist at the University of Maryland in College Park, found evidence for local adaptation in insects known as white peach scale on mulberry trees.</p>
        <p>The new studies are also helping to identify the rules that govern which insects can and cannot adapt and are giving clues to why the phenomenon may have eluded researchers in the past.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Karban, an ecologist at the University of California at Davis, is credited with providing one of the best demonstrations of insect adaptation to an individual plant, in this case tiny bugs called thrips and a shrub known as the seaside daisy. The thrips, which are about the size of the commas in this sentence, feed by rasping the plants' leaves and flowers.</p>
        <p>By bringing clones of the daisy into the laboratory and growing thrips on both their original plant and on others of the species, Dr. Karban was able to show that these insects thrived on the original plant and did poorly on the other ones.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karban said the thrips, like other insects that have evolved to feed on individual plants, appear able to achieve such specialization at least in part because of their rapid rate of reproduction as compared with the plants'. The same seaside daisy sits for tens or hundreds of years on the same spot. Meanwhile, the parthenogenetic thrips on the plant are doing evolutionary cartwheels, with as many as eight generations produced in a single year, and with natural selection working its magic on every new round of offspring.</p>
        <p>"So each individual plant is going to be sitting prey for many, many generations of these very, very short-lived insects," said Dr. Karban.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the thrips enjoy an extremely sedentary life style. Dr. Strauss and Dr. Karban found that uninfested seaside daisies sitting just yards from daisies teeming with millions of thrips are visited by, on average, one or two thrips in an entire year.</p>
        <p>More mobile insects find themselves and their offspring partaking of numerous plants as food sources, with accompanying evolutionary pressure to be able to eat and grow using any of them. In contrast, thrips and other sedentary bugs can focus on adapting to the one plant that they and their offspring will use. At the same time, they never interbreed with others of their species that evolved on a different plant. Unhindered by the influx of genes for eating other plants, each population remains specialized to its own host.</p>
        <p>The ponderosa pine insects that originally inspired this research show the extremes to which insects that hardly move at all during their lifetimes can become isolated on their host plants.</p>
        <p>These tiny creatures often move just inches from their mother before they attach themselves to the same pine needle or a neighboring one, remaining in the same position for their entire lives. As a result of such homebody habits, generation after generation of insects can remain on the same branch or twig. Dr. Alstad examined genetic variations in the proteins expressed by populations of scale insects on different twigs of a single pine tree and found that these populations were so different, it was as if mountain ranges loomed between them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alstad said that individual ponderosa pines were known to be chemically very heterogeneous. For example, needles exposed to sun differ in their chemical makeup from needles in shade.</p>
        <p>Some of the new research also suggests why other scientists have failed to find such specialization. At first pass, for example, it appeared that moth caterpillars eating sand live oaks in northern Florida were not adapted to individual trees. In a study to be published in the journal Evolution, Dr. Mopper and colleagues report that when they grew the caterpillars both on their natal trees and on novel trees, they saw no difference in mortality. But the unusual life style of these caterpillars, which spend their days mining the tissue of a single leaf, provided researchers with the opportunity to examine the situation more closely.</p>
        <p>"Leaf miners are unique because you can determine what causes their mortality," said Dr. Mopper. "They have a lot of natural enemies that leave characteristic scars in the mine when they attack the leaf miner. The host plant can also kill the leaf miners via defensive compounds, so they just die in the mine."</p>
        <p>When researchers carefully examined the causes of death they found that the leaf miners were indeed better at eating their home tree's leaves, and were not killed by the plant itself as often as they were on new trees. But overall mortality rates of both sets of caterpillars were similar. The reason is that as leaf miners become more finely adapted to their hosts, their enemies become more better at finding them, thereby wiping out their advantage.</p>
        <p>Because researchers have not looked as carefully into the causes of death or success of other insects, biologists say they could easily have missed local adaptation in other systems.</p>
        <p>The leaf miners are also unusual in that they grow to become moths, easily able to fly from tree to tree, raising the question of whether other mobile insects might also be adapted to individual host plants. Work by Dr. Strauss on a the sumac flea beetle also hints that even when insects can fly about and have their choice of hosts, they may end up concentrating on one particular plant.</p>
        <p>Researchers say the intense specialization of insects to individual plants and their subsequent inability to colonize neighbors indicate how widely plants can differ in their defensive abilities. The fact that different plants have many different defenses appears to be a major barrier to insects' attacking and devouring all hosts they might encounter. And, scientists warn that highly homogeneous stands of crops or cultivated forest trees might be especially susceptible to devastation by locally adapted insects, since these plants are much more similar to one another than are plants in wild populations.</p>
        <p>"There are a lot of potentially important consequences of this kind of fine-scale adaptation," said Dr. Karban. "We're planting hundreds of square miles of plants that are genetically uniform. And if there is this sort of fine-scale adaptation by herbivores to their host plants, and there's a lot of evidence that there is, then large-scale plantings of genetically uniform plants might be an invitation for disaster."</p>
        <p>Dr. Alstad agrees. "The fundamental take-home message is that if we engage in cultural practices that eliminate the heterogeneity in plants, then we eliminate evolutionary trade-offs that insects face," he said. "If we do that, they'll be the master of the only trade in town, and they'll take our forests apart."</p>
