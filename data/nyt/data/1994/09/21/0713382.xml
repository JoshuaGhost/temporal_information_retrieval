        <p>In a good-will gesture for a summit meeting with Russia next week, President Clinton signed a declaration today that frees the former Soviet state from one of the central political weapons of the cold war, a law tying trade conditions to emigration, senior Administration officials said.</p>
        <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, who will meet with Mr. Clinton in Washington next week, had contended that his country remained unfairly burdened by the 20-year-old American law, known as the Jackson-Vanik amendment, which was intended to embarrass Moscow for policies that made it difficult for Jews to emigrate.</p>
        <p>Since 1990, former President George Bush and Mr. Clinton have waived the law in granting Russia the standard level of low tariffs that the United States grants to almost every trading partner. But Mr. Yeltsin has complained, most recently at the Group of Seven meeting this summer, that the strides he and his country have taken in recent years should free them from the need to seek the annual waivers.</p>
        <p>"We're saying, 'Let's give us equal rights, get rid finally, once and for all, of this red jacket,' " Mr. Yeltsin declared at a joint news conference with Mr. Clinton in Naples last July. What has most annoyed Mr. Yeltsin, Administration officials say, is that the cold war-vestige that forces Russia to gain a special trade waiver appears to leave his country in the company of those like China rather than Britain or France.</p>
        <p>Since 1990, more than half a million Jews, 200,000 of them from Russia, have emigrated from the former Soviet Union, most of them to Israel. And in the last week, after years in which the Soviet Union allowed Jews to emigrate only in small numbers, leaders of major American Jewish groups have said that they believe Russia is now in full compliance with the American law.</p>
        <p>By making that declaration himself in a letter to Congress today, Mr. Clinton will make automatic the granting of the annual waiver necessary to allow Russia to maintain its favored trade status. Only Congress can repeal the law itself, so Russia will still be subject to its terms, including a requirement that the State Department report to Congress twice a year about its emigration practices.</p>
        <p>"This separates them from their Communist past," a senior Administration official said in disclosing the decision today. "And it separates them from China, with which they don't want to be compared."</p>
        <p>White House officials said Mr. Clinton planned to announce the decision before meeting with Mr. Yeltsin at the United Nations on Monday. The two leaders are to meet again in Washington on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The summit meeting will be the fifth between the two leaders since Mr. Clinton took office 20 months ago. But it will be their first in Washington, and it comes at a time of mounting tensions between the two countries about what steps to take next in quelling violence in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Today, senior American officials described the new trade guarantee as the redemption of a promise that Mr. Clinton made in July after the Russian President complained that his disavowal of Communism meant that he deserved better treatment. "I've taken that red, besmirched jacket off by myself," Mr. Yeltsin declared at the time.</p>
        <p>To help build support for move, the White House sought the endorsement of major American Jewish groups, including the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, whose leading members agreed in a conference call on Monday that Russia was in compliance with the Jackson-Vanik amendment.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Jacobson, a senior official of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, also noted in an interview that there had been a striking change in statistics since the mid-1980's, when his organization was monitoring the cases of tens of thousands of Jewish dissidents to whom the Soviet Union had refused permission to leave.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jacobson and other leaders of American Jewish organizations said they were glad that Mr. Clinton did not appear to be asking Congress to repeal the Jackson-Vanik law. They said they believed it was important that the legislation remain on the books to serve as a ready tool against Moscow in case Russia's leaders sought again to cap emigration.</p>
