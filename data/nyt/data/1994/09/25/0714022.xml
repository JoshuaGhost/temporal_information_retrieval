        <p>HOUSE WORK By Kristina McGrath. 198 pp. Bridgehampton, L.I.: Bridge Works Publishing Company.</p>
        <p>"MEMORY was the work of the house," Kristina McGrath writes in her moving first novel, a novel bold in accomplishment yet quiet in tone. The house, in a working-class Pittsburgh neighborhood, is for Ms. McGrath the locus of a child's first memories and, as such, a Garden of Eden before the Fall:</p>
        <p>"A wind-brought green all around us, the yard immense with high tipped-over grass. And when the wind turns . . . the fate of neighbors is swirling through the trees, and I am brought back to it, to that wind . . . to its something brewing, all awhirl with what we would become."</p>
        <p>The "house work" of the title is both the labor of a dedicated 1950's wife and mother, for whom keeping "a good house" is tantamount to keeping all of life in order, and also the work of a daughter, who uses domestic detail to reveal the family history. One is house-proud, the other house-haunted, and the result in Ms. McGrath's hands is a powerful evocation of childhood and an unforgettable portrait of a sad, chaotic marriage.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGrath wisely lets the truth about the marriage unfold slowly, seen from the shifting perspectives of the wife, the husband and their three children. The reader is allowed to settle in with these people, so when disaster strikes -- or even ordinary cruelty -- the shock is fresh.</p>
        <p>As the good marriage that Anna Hallissey thought she'd made turns sour, housework becomes for her both refuge and prayer. She cleans house compulsively as her husband, Guy, begins to spend more time in taverns. Her naive optimism sags as her husband's mood swings become more disruptive. She takes to tiptoeing around her own house, stopping only when she notices her children imitating her. This action is a key to Anna's character. Even if she can no longer care for her husband, she can make a good life for her children.</p>
        <p>"House Work" is finely constructed, its revelations so well paced that I don't want to give too many of them away. I do want to reassure the reader that this is not a male-bashing novel but a heart-rending depiction of a certain kind of family. As Guy becomes unhinged by the responsibilities of fatherhood, he is recognizable and thoroughly believable. Housework is Anna's escape; Guy finds solace elsewhere. When the collapse comes, Anna finally realizes that whatever is wrong, it's beyond her ability to fix.</p>
        <p>The prose of "House Work" has the pleasing complexity of high-flown lyricism frequently brought down to earth with sensory images that are exactly right: a group of boys on a city street, "church-solemn about being boy"; a man's beard stubble seeming to a child a chin "blue as mud," while laundry gives her mother "new hands afterward, changed by the starch, bittered."</p>
        <p>IT is the youngest daughter who, as a grown woman, fleshes out the story. Childhood terror is recalled -- "We hide knives behind the Magnavox because my sister says Daddy will make Mummy go to jail when she kills him" -- as is a powerful confidence: "River has a voice and I do too; from the very first day I've been hearing. And although I am stranded here . . . low to the floor, in a shaft of sunlight, simple as a bead, all along it's lap lap lap with a voice underneath that knows things." As a child, she promises herself "a larger life." That she eventually is able to view both parents with a sympathetic eye is one of the astonishments of the book.</p>
        <p>There are flaws in "House Work," occasional lapses into the verbal overkill that is a hazard of writing lyrical prose. Images are sometimes asked to carry too much weight, and end up seeming sloppy or arbitrary. The voice of the daughter in particular can become preachy, unwieldy with similes: "Daylight like a jailbreak is over. We hang around like a legend of blasted-out coops to nowhere."</p>
        <p>In prose as poetically charged as this, beauty matters; every word counts. And most of the time Ms. McGrath carries it off. All in all, "House Work" is a remarkable achievement. Kristina McGrath has set out to write a novel that tells us things we need to know about marriage and childhood, love and regret, memory and pain, and she has succeeded.  Kathleen Norris's most recent book is "Dakota: A Spiritual Geography."</p>
