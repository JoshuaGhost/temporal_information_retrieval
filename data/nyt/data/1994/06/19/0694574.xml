        <p>Growing up in Tampa, Dwight Gooden always looked forward to Fridays. Fridays were Father and Son Days in the Gooden household, the day he spent time alone with his dad.</p>
        <p>On those days, Dan Gooden would finish his job as a maintenance worker at Gardner Chemical, a local plant, and head straight home to pick up Dwight, his youngest child by 13 years. Together, Dan and Dwight would go to the bank and cash Dan's paycheck, then they would go to a local Italian restaurant, the same one every Friday, and have dinner. Dwight ordered spaghetti every single time.</p>

        <p>Growing up in Tampa, Dwight Gooden always looked forward to Fridays. Fridays were Father and Son Days in the Gooden household, the day he spent time alone with his dad.</p>
        <p>On those days, Dan Gooden would finish his job as a maintenance worker at Gardner Chemical, a local plant, and head straight home to pick up Dwight, his youngest child by 13 years. Together, Dan and Dwight would go to the bank and cash Dan's paycheck, then they would go to a local Italian restaurant, the same one every Friday, and have dinner. Dwight ordered spaghetti every single time.</p>
        <p>"It was always just me and Dad," said Dwight, now nearly 30 years old. "No one else was allowed to come."</p>
        <p>Dwight started canceling on his Fridays in high school -- "He started chasing girls, and he didn't want any more spaghetti after that," Dan said -- but the two found a new version of Father and Son Day once Dwight signed a major league contract with the Mets. Those days came when Dan flew to New York to stay with his son and accompany him to the ball park, the best days being the ones that Dwight pitched.</p>
        <p>It has been six years, though, since Dan Gooden has been able to watch the youngest of his four sons pitch a game in person. Complex health problems have limited his mobility and made it extremely difficult to travel. An Exception This Year</p>
        <p>He is making an exception this Father's Day. Friday night, Dan and his wife, Ella, flew to the Miami area and they are spending this weekend at the home of the Marlins' Gary Sheffield, who is Dwight's nephew and their grandson. And much of the family -- Dan included -- plan to make the pilgrimage to Joe Robbie Stadium Sunday night, in order to see Dwight pitch against Florida.</p>
        <p>"You miss it," said Dan, who last saw Dwight pitch in person at the All-Star Game in 1988. "We have a flight home, so I'll probably only go for a couple of innings. But I'm looking forward to being out there again."</p>
        <p>At age 66, Dan Gooden has undergone five operations related to his hip replacement and on a sunny day in South Florida, he needs a pair of crutches to walk his thin body from the front driveway at the Sheffield home into the dining room. He also has kidney problems that have forced him to undergo nearly four hours of dialysis three times a week every week for more than six years. 'Can't Get Around Well'xxx</p>
        <p>"He really can't get around that well and that's why he hasn't come to many games," said Dwight, who bought his father a satellite dish and a large-screen television so that he still could see him pitch. "It's been difficult for him."</p>
        <p>It's been difficult, too, for Dwight, who had grown accustomed to his father's long visits to New York during Mets' homestands and his semi-annual pilgrimages to Atlanta when the Mets played the Braves. Dan's last visit to New York was for a stay at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan in 1989, when Dwight brought him up to see specialists for his hip, which had become seriously infected.</p>
        <p>That year, 1989, Dwight spoke openly about how difficult it was for him to concetrate on his pitching while his father was so ill. He had similar problems this spring, when his father had to be hospitalized after his lungs filled with fluid and it became nearly impossible for him to breath on his own. Doctors have told Dan and the family that it would be best if he had another operation to help alleviate what are certain to be ongoing breathing problems, but Dan has refused. 'I Understand Now'</p>
        <p>"In the beginning, it made me mad," Dwight said of his father's decision. "But I understand now. When you spend 6 or 7 years always in and out of hospitals, you get tired of it."</p>
        <p>In an effort to better understand his father's trials, Dwight accompanied him to some of his dialysis appointments a few years ago. While Dan was attached to the machine, Dwight sat with him and tried to tell entertaining stories, but it was difficult, and both of them knew it.</p>
        <p>"I know he got bored," Dan said. "But he'd never say it. He was just walking around and walking around. I was glad, though, that he came."</p>
        <p>As Dan says, "Everything I have now, Dwight gave me -- he's taken care of me and his mom." But Dwight has done so because his father did so much for him as a child. There were, of course, those Father and Son Days, and the baseball practices in the park, and the trips to his games from Little League to the big leagues, and, of course, all their joint excursions to the ball park when Dwight was a child. 'He Was Very Supportive'</p>
        <p>"He sacrificed a lot of things for me," Dwight said. "He taught me all the basic stuff about baseball, went to all my games. He was very supportive, and I was very fortunate."</p>
        <p>Dan was a ballplayer himself, a first baseman who played in semi-pro leagues in Georgia before moving to Tampa, where he was a part-time coach. He once tried out for the Philadelphia Phillies, back in the early 1940s, but that was before Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in baseball, and, according to Dan, the Phillies told him at the time that it just wouldn't be possible for him to be on the team.</p>
        <p>"By the time they let us play, I was too old," Dan said. "So I told myself I might have a kid who played in the major leagues. And I did."</p>
        <p>The proudest day of Dan's life was the day Dwight signed his first major league contract, back in 1982, the year the Mets made Dwight their first pick in the free agent draft. Dan had secured an agent for his son, but he participated in the contract talks with Joe McIlvaine, then on his first stint as the Mets' general manager, and the two still joke about it today.</p>
        <p>"He tells me that I got the best of him that time," Dan said of McIlvaine. "But I tell him that if he looks at what Dwight's done for him, he got the best of me."</p>
        <p>Dan didn't get to see Dwight pitch in the minor leagues, but he flew to Houston in April 1984 to see Dwight's major league debut. And for the five innings that Dwight was on the mound, he hardly could sit still.</p>
        <p>"I think I was more nervous than he was," Dan said. "I felt like I was playing. I always feel that way."</p>
        <p>Dan still gets nervous -- and excited -- every time he watches Dwight pitch a baseball game, even though he must do so via the satellite dish. It's not the same, though, as being there. And that is something both Dwight and Dan have missed.</p>
        <p>"He says now that when I'm out there playing, it's like he's out there," Dwight said. "He's living his dream through me. And that's fine with me."</p>
