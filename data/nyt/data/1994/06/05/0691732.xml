        <p>ON a warm summer day, when you want to eat something light, a seafood salad is particularly refreshing. One of my favorites is a classic spicy Thai salad made with shrimp, scallops and fish tossed in a dressing of green chilies and coriander and served with rice.</p>
        <p>Sea scallops are good seared and served on thick slices of ripe tomato, topped with fried capers and onion rings, which add a crunchy texture.</p>
        <p>Daniel Boulud, chef of Daniel Restaurant in Manhattan, serves squid on a bed of arugula, in a vinaigrette dressing made with sesame and shallots. The mild taste of the squid goes very well with the sharpness of the dressing and the pleasant bitterness of the arugula leaves.</p>
        <p>I prefer seafood salads served at room temperature, not ice cold, so that you can taste the full flavor of the ingredients. The ingredients should be impeccably fresh, of course, and seafood should be cooked within a few hours of being served. Vegetables should never be left sitting in the refrigerator. This is particularly important for tomatoes.</p>
        <p>A chilled dry white wine or beer goes best with the following dishes. Squid and Arugula Salad With Sesame Seeds Total time 25 minutes  1 sprig thyme  1 bay leaf  10 coriander seeds  Juice of 2 lemons  1/2 pound squid, cleaned, washed and drained  2 sweet red peppers, split and seeded  3 tablespoons olive oil  1 small clove garlic, peeled and chopped  2 sprigs fresh coriander, leaves only, chopped  1/2 tablespoon sesame oil  1 tablespoon shallots, peeled and finely chopped  1 sprig fresh mint, leaves only, half of them chopped  2 bunches arugula, leaves only  1 tablespoon chives, minced  1 tablespoon sesame seeds  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. In a large pot over high heat, combine one quart water with one teaspoon salt, thyme, bay leaf, coriander seeds, the juice of half a lemon and freshly ground pepper. Bring to boil and cook for three minutes. Add the squid and boil again for another two to three minutes. Drain the squid and set aside to cool. Discard the cooking liquid with the herbs and condiments. Slice the squid into fourth-inch pieces and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat the broiler. Brush the skin of the sweet red peppers with a half tablespoon of the oil and place on a baking sheet. Cook under the broiler until the skin turns black, about five to seven minutes. Remove from heat, let cool and wash the burned skin off under running water. Pat dry and cut the roasted pepper into thin strips. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. In a bowl, mix the squid, the red pepper strips, the juice of one lemon, one-and-a-half tablespoons of the olive oil, the garlic, half of the chopped coriander leaves, the sesame oil, the shallots, the chopped mint leaves and salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>4. In a separate bowl, mix the arugula with half of the chives, half of the sesame seeds, juice from one-half lemon, the remaining tablespoon olive oil and salt and pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>5. Toast the remaining sesame seeds in a dry pan over medium heat or under the broiler, tossing often for one to two minutes or until golden, and set aside. Divide the arugula among four plates and spoon even amounts of squid on top of each bed of leaves. Sprinkle with the remaining minced chives, toasted sesame seeds, coriander leaves and mint leaves.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings. Seared Sea Scallops With Fried Onions Total time: 20 minutes  4 tablespoons salted capers  1 medium red onion  Peanut or vegetable oil for deep frying  Flour for dredging  16 large sea scallops (about 1 1/2 pounds)  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper  1/4 cup plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil  4 to 5 large ripe tomatoes, sliced 1/4-inch thick  1 clove garlic, minced (green part removed)  1 to 2 tablespoons balsamic</p>
        <p>vinegar (to taste)  1/4 cup fresh basil leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Soak capers in water to cover for 10 minutes. Rinse under cold running water and pat dry. Slice onion in rings one-fourth-inch thick. Separate rings.</p>
        <p>2. Heat enough peanut or vegetable oil to come one-fourth of the way up the side of a deep fryer. Lightly dredge the onions in the flour and place in a frying basket. Deep-fry until golden. Drain on paper towels. Dredge the capers with the flour, deep fry and remove with a slotted spoon when golden. Drain on paper towels.</p>
        <p>3. Heat a large nonstick skillet until hot. Season scallops with salt and pepper and saute them in two teaspoons olive oil in one layer over high heat, turning once, until seared and opaque, about two minutes each side.</p>
        <p>4. To assemble the salad, arrange the tomatoes on four plates. Place the scallops on top. Combine the quarter-cup olive oil, garlic and vinegar and sprinkle lightly over the scallops. Season with pepper and garnish with the onion rings, capers and basil leaves.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings. Spicy Thai Seafood Salad Total Time: 25 minutes  3 cloves garlic, green part removed  2 green chilies  1 bunch coriander  1 teaspoon sugar  3 tablespoons Thai fish sauce  1/2 cup fresh lime juice  4 cups water  1/2 pound medium shrimps, peeled  1/2 pound white fish fillets, like sea bass or monkfish, cut in 1/2-inch pieces.  1/2 pound bay scallops, or sea scallops halved  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  3 scallions, sliced  1 red chili  Coriander leaves to garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Combine garlic, green chilies, coriander, sugar, fish sauce and one-fourth cup lime juice in blender's bowl. Puree.</p>
        <p>2. Bring water to boil in a saucepan with one-fourth teaspoon salt and remaining lime juice. Poach seafood two to three minutes, or until cooked. Drain and toss in a bowl with the coriander dressing. Add pepper, scallions and red chili. Garnish with coriander leaves and serve warm or at room temperature.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings</p>
        <p>Note: Serve with rice. Thai fish sauce is found in specialty stores.  FOOD</p>
