        <p>"What did you do in the war, Daddy?" is the question American children of my generation asked their fathers, and the answers were the stuff of a thousand unforgettable bedtime stories. As my own father, who served in the China-Burma-India Theater during the war, said to me as I turned 45 last week: "I can't remember what I was doing when I was 45, but I still remember everything about what happened on D-Day, when I was 23."</p>
        <p>Many of today's children must ask their fathers a radically different question: "How did you get out of the war, Daddy?" And the answer can be simple or complex. Of the many American men who eluded service in the Vietnam War, only a fraction can boast that they resisted the draft, paying a price in exile or jail or both for that principled stand. The rest of us, as strongly opposed to the war on moral grounds as we might have been, found other, easier, often devious ways out -- from a high number in the draft lottery (my lucky case) to the intricate manipulation of educational and medical deferments (which would have been my case had I been less lucky).</p>

        <p>"What did you do in the war, Daddy?" is the question American children of my generation asked their fathers, and the answers were the stuff of a thousand unforgettable bedtime stories.

        <p>Many of today's children must ask their fathers a radically different question: "How did you get out of the war, Daddy?" And the answer can be simple or complex. Of the many American men who eluded service in the Vietnam War, only a fraction can boast that they resisted the draft, paying a price in exile or jail or both for that principled stand. The rest of us, as strongly opposed to the war on moral grounds as we might have been, found other, easier, often devious ways out -- from a high number in the draft lottery (my lucky case) to the intricate manipulation of educational and medical deferments (which would have been my case had I been less lucky).</p>
        <p>This, of course, is the Bill Clinton story, and as he heads toward Normandy for the 50th anniversary of the Allied invasion, his draft history of a quarter-century ago threatens to paralyze his Presidency. From his post-inaugural waffle on homosexuals in the military to his inconsistent and often incoherent policies on Bosnia, Haiti, China and Rwanda, he is addled by any issue that involves even the rumor of war. And the ante keeps rising, most alarmingly now in North Korea.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton must pull himself out of this quandary. But he isn't likely to do so as long as he tries to pretend to be what he is not. Instead of boning up on D-Day to gild his disingenuous Commander in Chief photo ops -- as he showily did by conferring with the scholar Paul Fussell pre-departure -- he might better acknowledge his solidarity with the millions of men of his age who stopped at nothing, from using pull to get into the reserves to faking transvestism, to escape duty in Vietnam. Only if the dirty little secret of the cold-war generation is fully declassified will the national dialogue be candid enough to sort out the country's mission in the post-cold-war world.</p>
        <p>The phrase "dirty little secret" I borrow from the writer James Fallows, whose 1989 book "More Like Us" offers a ruthless account of what went on during the Vietnam draft. Mr. Fallows describes how he, as a Harvard undergraduate with a low lottery number, depressed his weight and psychological profile to flunk his draft examination. So did four out of five of his peers. Calling the Vietnam War "America's most blatant class war since the Civil War" -- in which Northerners bought their way out of the draft -- Mr. Fallows recalls how "the college-educated class" stayed at home while "the less educated and less privileged" went to Vietnam.</p>
        <p>That college-educated, war-shirking class of the Vietnam era is the one running the United States today. It includes not only Mr. Clinton but Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and the vast majority of the White House staffs in both this White House and the last, not to mention most 40-something pundits, left and right. The pretense that Bill Clinton's behavior was anomalous among ambitious, affluent and white draft-age students of the Vietnam era is absurd. Senator Bob Kerrey's war service is the exception; Mr. Clinton's behavior was the norm.</p>
        <p>That history cannot be rewritten now. It's the hand the country has been dealt. No matter how much we all bone up on our fathers' inspiring D-Day recollections this weekend, we cannot transform today's generation of leaders into yesterday's. Nor, short of an upset Bob Dole victory in '96, will we elect a World War II hero President again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has lately taken to attributing his foreign policy woes to failures of communication; he has just quadrupled the staff in his foreign policy press office. But this President is a brilliant communicator when he has something to say. To find his voice, he needs to free himself from the past that is choking it. Were he to articulate honestly where he's been, then maybe he could figure out where he is going. The antiwar generation that shares his dirty little secret might even follow him into battle, if only he would stop posturing and start to lead.</p>
