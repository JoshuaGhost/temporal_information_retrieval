        <p>WHEN the ocean is one's work muse, setting up an office takes ingenuity, and tires with good traction.</p>
        <p>Dan Rattiner's office-by-the-sea is a Toyota van parked on the sands of Sagaponack. Practicing ergonomics, Mr. Rattiner avoids the steering wheel and sits in the passenger seat. The back seat is filled by his sheepdog, Wags. As Wags sleeps, Mr. Rattiner writes, the waves of the Atlantic lapping near his laptop.</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine a more ideal way of making a living than writing a newspaper overlooking the ocean in Southampton. As chief reporter, columnist, editor, publisher and president of Dan's Papers, Mr. Rattiner (pronounced ra-TEEN-er) may have discovered journalistic heaven. He is, however, mortal.</p>
        <p>"I almost locked myself in my car today," he said as a visitor approached. It seems that when the muse is missing Mr. Rattiner takes a nap in his van. But first he is always careful to lock the doors by pressing his remote alarm setter-door opener.</p>
        <p>As he took a nap the other day the battery for the automatic opener ran out. "I couldn't open the car doors," he said. "Well, I could have opened a door, but that would have set the alarm off, and I don't know how to stop it. I knew two years ago when I first got the car, but I don't remember now."</p>
        <p>Which meant that Mr. Rattiner and Wags stayed trapped until the publisher finally jiggled the opener enough times that it signaled one last, "Shut off the alarm."</p>
        <p>"I've got to go right away to Radio Shack and get a new battery," he said. "After I go for my frozen yogurt. I always get a TCBY yogurt after I finish writing at the beach." Mix of 'Fact, Fiction and Whimsy'</p>
        <p>The yogurt is Mr. Rattiner's reward. For many Hamptonites, his newspaper is the reward for enduring endless traffic jams to reach one of America's most celebrated resorts. "Everybody out here loves Dan's Papers," said Connie Collins of Bridgehampton, a former reporter for WNBC-TV News. "Dan is to the Hamptons what Nathans hot dogs are to Coney Island. I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds good."</p>
        <p>For 34 years, Mr. Rattiner has written about the Hamptons in what his associate publisher, Tim McDarrah, calls a combination of "fact, fiction and whimsy, and often all three in the same sentence."</p>
        <p>His free weekly newspaper, one of the first free papers in the country, has become so popular that to balance the advertising with the editorial content Mr. Rattiner now writes five articles a week. "They're from 800 to 2,000 words each," he said. "I figure it's equivalent to writing a novel every two or three months."</p>
        <p>No wonder he needs a muse. This month more prose will become available from Mr. Rattiner. "Who's Here: The Heart of the Hamptons" is being published by the Pushcart Press of Wainscott. The book is a selection of his profiles of the prominent and not-so-prominent who inhabit the Hamptons. The subjects vary from Martha Stewart to Alger Hiss. Jerry Della Femina rates two profiles, "because his life has changed so," Mr. Rattiner said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rattiner's life, however, remains constant. His newspaper has changed little over 30 years. In the Rattiner style of journalism truth doesn't get in the way of a good story. With the exception of the paper's profiles, one never knows what is fact or fiction. "I want to throw the reader off stride," Mr. Rattiner said. "I want to say to them, 'Don't believe everything you read in the newspaper.' "</p>
        <p>He succeeds so well that even the staff is not sure. "When I got back from Hawaii a few months ago," said Maureen Taylor, managing editor of The Montauk Pioneer, one of Dan's Papers, "I picked up a paper and read about a deer hunt in North Haven. It said 240 people had been slaughtered along with the deer. I thought, 'What have I missed!' I read it and I believed it."</p>
        <p>"It was obvious it was a hoax," another employee, Roger Ziegler, said.</p>
        <p>"Not to me it wasn't," Ms. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>From Montauk to Manhattan everybody with a tie to the Hamptons seems to have a favorite Dan story.  Mr. McDarrah's favorite was during the "Jaws" era. "I was a teen-ager then," he said. "We had a house in East Hampton. I heard on every radio station that people were going down to the beach with raw meat and throwing it in the water so the sharks would eat it and not the people."</p>
        <p>Other media organizations, as often happens, had picked up one of Mr. Rattiner's hoaxes and were broadcasting it as fact. Mr. Rattiner had published a feeding schedule for great white sharks. If, for example, sharks were fed on Mondays at one beach it would be safe to swim at another beach across town.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taylor's favorite story was "when Dan said government officials were threatening to blow up the Montauk Lighthouse."</p>
        <p>"They had blown up the Shinnecock Lighthouse and they said the Montauk Light wasn't necessary, either," she said. "So Dan called for a 'light-in' at the lighthouse. Thousands showed up with candles and flashlights."</p>
        <p>Many give Mr. Rattiner credit for saving the Montauk Lighthouse, as well as other landmarks. Interspersed with his tongue-in-cheek articles are pieces that crusade for economic and social issues and institutions on the South Fork. "I like to think I'm helpful to the community," he said. "To make it a better place. I often use humor for that." Which Shopping List? Which Day?</p>
        <p>In person Mr. Rattiner is no Henny Youngman. There is almost a meekness to the man whose dry sense of humor is so evident in his writing.  "He really lives in his mind," his wife, Susyn, said. "He's shy. He's gentle and he has this interesting sense of humor.</p>
        <p>"He is always preoccupied with his stories. So much so that I once gave him a list to go food shopping. He was gone for hours. When he came back, and I said, 'Where is the food?' he said, 'Oh, I forgot.' A few days later I came home, and he said, 'Well, I went food shopping and I got everything on the list.' And I said: 'What list? You mean the list I gave you a few days ago?' I had gotten everything on that list. But he was so proud that he had remembered to shop. That captures who he is."</p>
        <p>What he looks like -- with a white beard, white outfits and fedora hats -- is a cross between Rip van Winkle and Tom Wolfe. The look is not for image, he maintains. "I've developed an allergy to the sun," he said. "The hats and the white clothing help with that."</p>
        <p>The white hair must be premature. Mr. Rattiner is 54. But his persona and his writing style have made him a celebrity in the Hamptons. George Plimpton calls him "one of the great institutions of the South Fork, right up there with the windmills."</p>
        <p>"He's an icon," Ms. Collins said. He certainly seems to know everybody.</p>
        <p>"And everyone knows Dan," said Don Evans, who with David Loewenberg held a book party for Mr. Rattiner at their restaurant, 95 School Street in Bridgehampton. It was the second book party in a week for the newspaperman. The first, in Manhattan, drew 500 people. At both parties guests spent most of their time feverishly scanning the index to find out whether they were in the book.</p>
        <p>Ms. Collins was one of the lucky few. "I come from such a small hometown, Vinton, Va.," she said. "It's so small that I'm the most famous person to ever have come from there. They've started a historical society, and this book will definitely go in it."</p>
        <p>One of those whose profile made the paper but not the book was Robert Morton of Bridgehampton, executive producer of "The Late Show With David Letterman." "I guess I'm one of the 335 rejects," he said after checking the chapter headings. Still Mr. Morton didn't put down the book. "I'm curious to see how Dan treats Alger Hiss," he said.</p>
        <p>According to Bill Henderson of Pushcart Press there is such interest in the book -- at least from those who are not in it -- "that it could be a series."</p>
        <p>"The people who were left out will have to wait for the next edition," Mr. Henderson said.</p>
        <p>That's a long list. Mr. Rattiner has a Rolodex with 1,000 names and home telephone numbers, from A, for Elkan Abramowitz, Woody Allen's lawyer, to Z, for Mort Zuckerman, publisher of The Daily News. Mr. Rattiner counts among his friends some of the most influential citizens of Manhattan and the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>Celebrity friends were nonexistent when he moved with his parents, Alan and Jeanette, from New Jersey to Montauk in the 50's. His father took over White's drugstore, and as a teen-ager Mr. Rattiner worked there. "He was the worst employee," his mother recalled. "His father kept firing him." Until he found his niche. "Dan was put in charge of the soda fountain," Mrs. Rattiner said.</p>
        <p>At 19, during a summer off from the University of Rochester, Mr. Rattiner started The Montauk Pioneer. He distributed it free. "Everybody thought I was crazy," he said. "But I thought people coming to motels are not going to pay for a paper. But if I make it real pretty they might read it." The income would come from advertisements sold to restaurants.  What he put in obviously paid off. The paper was profitable in its first summer.</p>
        <p>After Rochester he attended Harvard, where he studied architecture, but the journalism drive continued. With a partner he started The East Village Other. At the same time he was starting an East Hampton edition of his free weekly newspaper. He didn't know what to name his East End papers. "So a friend, Ron Ziel, told me to call them Dan's Papers," he recalled. "Like Joe's Hots."</p>
        <p>When profiling a Hamptons resident in his paper, Mr. Rattiner always asks what one thing happened in their lives to cause them to become who they are today. "I have two moments of truths," he said when asked that question. "In high school I took a journalism course and I had a violent reaction to all those rules: News must be on the front page. You must use the inverted pyramid."</p>
        <p>Journalism should not be so structured, Mr. Rattiner decided. And in 1966, he said, "I was running The East Village Other and I went to St. Thomas on vacation. I came back and I'm walking to work when I passed a crowd of people gathered in front of a restaurant on Avenue A. They were watching a giant rat eat the garbage. The day before I had been sitting under a palm tree. I said, 'I don't want to be here anymore. I want to be where there is salt spray and beauty.' "</p>
        <p>He moved his career permanently to the Hamptons. He has never looked back.</p>
        <p>Through the years there were four children, -- Maya, Adam, David and Gabriel -- and three wives. In the early days Mr. Rattiner would shut down the paper for six months, and he and his family would take out an atlas and pick an exotic location. "Then we'd go live there for months," he said. "We lived in Maui, France, the Canary Islands, Guatemala."</p>
        <p>Today there is little time for travel.  He is too busy overseeing what he calls Dan's Papers world headquarters in an old house on Montauk Highway in Bridgehampton.</p>
        <p>A few years ago Jerry Finkelstein, the communications magnate, purchased part of Dan's Papers. "It wasn't for sale," Mr. Rattiner said. "But he made it happen. I was very happy. We own it together. He just owns a bigger part."</p>
        <p>The Finkelstein connection has made the paper bigger and slicker.  Last summer its circulation reached 87,000. People pick it up at 2,500 businesses on the Island and in outlets in Manhattan. There are also the special deliveries. Each week 150 copies are hand-delivered to a few of the most exclusive homes in the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>"We deliver to Gin Lane," Mr. McDarrah said. "And a few of the roads south of the highway. We toss a paper in Calvin Klein's driveway and Spielberg's. Martha Stewart gets a copy. They all know Dan. They want to read Dan. But maybe they don't go to the local supermarket. And it's important they see the paper."</p>
        <p>Celebrities are a critical part of the readership and the draw of Dan's Papers, and Mr. McDarrah realizes that. Before joining the paper he worked for eight years at The New York Post. "Part of me is totally shameless," he said, "I have swiped pictures of dead people off the family mantle."</p>
        <p>For several years he wrote the gossip items for Page 6 of The Post.  Now he knows all the gossip in the Hamptons. "So many boldface names are out here," he said. "People thought I was coming out of the loop, but the loop is out here. I play softball with Mort Zuckerman and Ken Auletta. I just got back from Kurt Vonnegut's house."</p>
        <p>Working for Mr. Rattiner has been an inspiration, he said. He admires his writing and his contacts. The celebrities in Mr. Rattiner's Rolodex are impressive, Mr. McDarrah said. "But he doesn't have Yoko Ono's phone number, and I do." Then he paused. "But then," Mr. McDarrah added, "he has Ralph Lauren's car-phone number, and I don't."  ABOUT LONG ISLAND</p>
