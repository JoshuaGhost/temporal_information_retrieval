        <p>A Federal judge today gave the deadlocked Nassau County Board of Supervisors one last chance to come up with a plan for a new county government that will comply with the one-person, one-vote principle.</p>

        <p>A Federal judge today gave the deadlocked Nassau County Board of Supervisors one last chance to come up with a plan for a new county government that will comply with the one-person, one-vote principle.</p>
        <p>The judge, Arthur D. Spatt, said that if the board failed to endorse a plan within two weeks, he was prepared to appoint a "politically neutral" special master to formulate a plan that the court would then impose on the county.</p>
        <p>Judge Spatt's decision surprised board members and represented a setback for Republicans, who have dominated county government here. Two weeks ago, the judge said that if the board failed to endorse a plan for a new county legislature, he would probably impose the Republican-sponsored plan adopted by the charter revision commission. As a result, Republicans resisted compromise with Democrats, who have charged that the plan unfairly insured an overwhelming Republican majority on the 19-member legislature. Bipartisan Support</p>
        <p>Supervisor Thomas Suozzi, a Democrat, and Mayor of the City of Glen Clove, said he was pleased with the judge's two-week extension.</p>
        <p>"The Republicans thought they controlled all the cards and that the judge would adopt their plan," Mr. Suozzi said. "Faced with the possibility that the judge might appoint a special court master, the Republicans can't be so certain they'll get what they want. They should now be willing to negotiate."</p>
        <p>Gregory P. Peterson, a Republican and Presiding Supervisor of the Town of Hempstead, also said he was pleased with the extension. "This should give us enough time to work things out," he said. "Nearly 99 percent of our differences have to do with district lines, and that's an appropriate matter for the board to settle." Opportunity to Vote</p>
        <p>Judge Spatt said Nassau voters should have an opportunity to vote on a new form of government, but he said that if he were to impose a plan on the county, he would lack the power to order a referendum. He said that only the board could place a plan on the November ballot.</p>
        <p>Last year, Judge Spatt declared the board and its weighted voting system unconstitutional, finding that it failed to meet the constitutional requirement of one-person, one-vote. He ordered that the county devise a plan to replace itself with a new legislature that also conformed with the Federal Voting Rights Act by providing representation for Nassau's growing minority community.</p>
        <p>The board is in general agreement that the new legislature should consist of 19 members, with two elected from districts where minorities are the dominant voting bloc.</p>
        <p>Although the board is currently made up of two Republicans and four Democrats, its weighted voting system has left the members deadlocked. No issue can win approval without the support of at least one member from the opposite party.</p>
        <p>Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the county by a ratio of 3 to 2. And since Republicans also dominate the Commission on Government Revision, Democrats have argued that many of the district lines drawn by the commission unfairly favor Republicans.  Several Plans to Be Weighed</p>
        <p>Judge Spatt said today that while the commission's work was commendable, its plan would be among several, including two from the Democrats, that he or a special court master would consider.</p>
        <p>He said he not only questioned the "political fairness" of the plan produced by the commission, but did not like the fact that some of the lines on its 19-district map "unfairly cut through community areas."</p>
        <p>Should he appoint a special master, the judge said he would choose a person from outside the county who is a political independent to review all of the proposed plans. "Only the two minority districts are etched in stone," he said.</p>
        <p>Black members of the commission and several people who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to the judge's original order told the judge today that they were concerned that further debate might cause them to lose the two districts drawn by the commission.</p>
        <p>Judge Spatt ordered the board to resume efforts to reach a compromise, and scheduled a status conference for July 6 at 4 P.M.</p>
