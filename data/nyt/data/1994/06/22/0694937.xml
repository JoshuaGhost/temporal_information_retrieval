        <p>There was just one thing that the Nigeria national team, the Super Eagles, failed to accomplish in its first appearance in the World Cup finals. Keep a secret. Nigeria's debut, a 3-0 victory over Bulgaria this evening in which it overcame some early mistakes, created the possibilities that the Eagles could duplicate the accomplishments of Cameroon four years ago.</p>
        <p>Rashidi Yekini's goal, in the 21st minute, showed the precision and passion that the Nigerians have brought to the competition. After Yekini converted a centering pass from George Finidi, he kept running until he reached the rear of the net.

        <p>There was just one thing that the Nigeria national team, the Super Eagles, failed to accomplish in its first appearance in the World Cup finals. Keep a secret. Nigeria's debut, a 3-0 victory over Bulgaria this evening in which it overcame some early mistakes, created the possibilities that the Eagles could duplicate the accomplishments of Cameroon four years ago.</p>
        <p>Rashidi Yekini's goal, in the 21st minute, showed the precision and passion that the Nigerians have brought to the competition. After Yekini converted a centering pass from George Finidi, he kept running until he reached the rear of the net. Yekini held the netting with both hands, his eyes pressed shut with the setting sun shining on his face, as he screamed with joy.</p>
        <p>The victory, which gives Nigeria 3 points in Group D going into its meeting with Argentina on Saturday at Foxboro, Mass., served to raise the collective sense of confidence of a team made up of players that all compete professionally outside of Nigeria.</p>
        <p>"Most of the players play in Europe," Yekini said. "So we have the confidence from the clubs. But coming into the World Cup was not easy as a group." 17 Losses for Bulgaria</p>
        <p>Bulgaria, which has never won a match in the World Cup finals, extended its winless streak to 17 with the loss. Bulgaria outshot Nigeria, 18-11, and had several early opportunities that could have produced a lead.</p>
        <p>"You have to get a grip on the game," said Peter Rufai, the Nigeria goalkeeper. "You have to see the game. You have to see what the opponents are up to. They seized the opportunity to come to us. It was not because we were nervous. From the moment we got our composure, we took over the game."</p>
        <p>Rufai made several difficult saves in the first 30 minutes. And the Eagles received some help when Hristo Stoitchkov, Bulgaria's player of the year from 1989 through 1992, failed to realize that he had been awarded an indirect kick in the 37th minute.</p>
        <p>Stoitchkov, who was fouled by Austin Eguavoen, took a hard shot that beat Rufai over his left shoulder into the upper right corner of the net. But it was disallowed. Rufai had recognized the signal for an indirect free kick. "I was kind of surprised he would play the ball one time into the goal," Rufai said.</p>
        <p>Dimitri Penev, the Bulgarian coach, acknowledged that there had been confusion. "We couldn't quite see what the referee was showing," he said through a translator. Stoitchkov, also through a translator, said he had not received a clear signal.</p>
        <p>Six minutes later, Nigeria took a 2-0 lead when Yekini advanced the ball past Bulgarian defender Trifon Ivanov and made a pass to Daniel Amokachi. When another Bulgarian defender, Zlatko Iankov, fell, Amokachi was able to successfully chase the loose ball towards the right of goalkeeper Borislav Mihailov. Amokachi turned, and from a difficult angle made a left-footed shot beneath the crossbar for a 2-0 lead that took control of the game.</p>
        <p>"After the second goal," said Penev, the Bulgarian coach, "the team lost its motivation and the quality of the game came down."</p>
        <p>Not for the Nigerians, who were enjoying a long-awaited arrival of their program before a crowd of 44,132, slightly more than two-thirds of capacity at the Cotton Bowl, and an international audience. "I told them it's showtime," said Clemens Westerhof, the Nigeria coach. "You show them what you can do. We came here to show we can play football in Africa. We are there. Maybe the next match we lose. It doesn't matter."  WORLD CUP '94</p>
