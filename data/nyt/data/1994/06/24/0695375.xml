        <p>In a chaotic melodrama worthy of Italy's other great passion, grand opera, the Italian national soccer team pushed itself to the brink of elimination from the World Cup today, before Dino Baggio's diving header salvaged a 1-0 victory over Norway.</p>
        <p>The lanky midfielder scored with about 21 minutes left in the game -- a game that had already seen the more famous Baggio, Roberto, no relation, yanked by his coach less than a quarter of the way into the match. That move came moments after Italy's goalkeeper, Gianluca Pagliuca, was red-carded by the referee, forcing him out of the game and requiring Italy to play with 10 men the rest of the way.</p>

        <p>In a chaotic melodrama worthy of Italy's other great passion, grand opera, the Italian national soccer team pushed itself to the brink of elimination from the World Cup today, before Dino Baggio's diving header salvaged a 1-0 victory over Norway.</p>
        <p>The lanky midfielder scored with about 21 minutes left in the game -- a game that had already seen the more famous Baggio, Roberto, no relation, yanked by his coach less than a quarter of the way into the match. That move came moments after Italy's goalkeeper, Gianluca Pagliuca, was red-carded by the referee, forcing him out of the game and requiring Italy to play with 10 men the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>And the rest of the way saw even more plot contortions. Franco Baresi, Italy's sweeper, had to leave with an injury a few minutes into the second half. Paolo Maldini, the left fullback who took over the captain's role after Roberto Baggio left, was kicked hard by Jostein Flo midway through the second half and Italy played two men short for nearly four minutes while Maldini got the ankle taped.</p>
        <p>With 74,624 fans sounding ready to roar "EE-TAL-YA" all the long sunny afternoon at Giants Stadium, the Italia team started off strong. Norway was playing its infamous negative game -- like hockey's dump-and-chase tactic, except without much chase.</p>
        <p>Italy kept pressure on the Norwegian defense and Norway didn't get a shot off for the first 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>Then the game got bizarre. Little Erik (the Mosquito) Mykland, one of Norway's few talents with the ball, sliced a through pass behind Italy's attempted offside trap and suddenly, Oyvind Leonhardsen was dashing toward the penalty area on a breakaway.</p>
        <p>There was nothing for Pagliuca to do but race to meet him. Unfortunately for Italy, the race ended just outside the area, where goalies cannot use their hands. Pagliuca flung himself on his right side at the oncoming ball and player; his left arm flew up, deflecting the ball away and tripping Leonhardsen.</p>
        <p>Referee Hellmut Krug of Germany immediately showed the red card. Pagliuca was ejected for intentionally using his hand to stop a breakaway. It Couldn't Be True</p>
        <p>The back-up keeper, Luca Marchegiani, went in, but Italy had to play a man short, so someone else had to come off. The whole stadium went quiet as the throng realized which player was being taken off: Baggio.</p>
        <p>"I did it to save him and to save the team," said Arrigo Sacchi, Italy's coach. "He has some injuries. We needed 10 players on the field who could run all the time."</p>
        <p>Baggio has been bothered by a sore Achilles tendon, but the look on his face as he saw the coach waving him off made it perfectly clear he didn't think his injuries were serious enough to prevent him running hard for 70 more minutes. As for Italy's fans, most of them thought Sacchi had gone mad. Three New Starters</p>
        <p>The game, already less than elegant, became a disorganized mess after Baggio's removal. Italy not only was missing Baggio and Pagliuca, but had three new starters on the field: Pierluigi Casiraghi, trying, with little success, to operate as a center forward; Nicola Berti in midfield and Giuseppe Signori dropping back there as well, the two replacing Alberigo Evani and Roberto Donadoni; and Antonio Benarrivo replacing Mauro Tassotti at right fullback.</p>
        <p>After Baresi left and Maldini got hurt, there was even more chaos. Italy appeared lucky to hold onto a 0-0 draw.</p>
        <p>But another of Norway's endless succession of brutish fouls gave Italy a free kick about 10 yards left of the penalty area. Signori, with his wicked left foot, launched the ball to the goalmouth, where Dino Baggio -- who scored the goal that beat Portugal, 1-0, to seal Italy's qualification for this World Cup -- got his head on it for the winning goal. Perils of Playing Short</p>
        <p>"We knew, after the sending-off, that Italy couldn't score on anything other than a set play," like a free kick, said Norwegian Coach Egil Olsen. "But they're always a problem on set pieces."</p>
        <p>Sacchi said his team was nervous playing with only 10 men.</p>
        <p>"We deserved to win this game because we played with nine and sometimes eight on the field," he said, not counting the goalkeeper.  "Playing 70 minutes with only 10 men is very hard. We left our hearts on the field."</p>
        <p>And, he added, "The other team didn't want to win -- they played for a tie."</p>
        <p>A tie would have suited the Norwegians fine; they won their first game against Mexico, 1-0, in Washington last Sunday, the day after Italy lost to Ireland by the same score and put itself in jeopardy regarding advancement to the second round. Now, Norway, Italy and Ireland all have 3 points in Group E. Mexico and Ireland meet in Orlando, Fla., on Friday; the Italy-Mexico and Ireland-Norway games will be played next Tuesday. CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>The red card issued to GIANLUCA PAGLIUCA means he must miss Italy's next game, against Mexico, and may miss an additional one; the length of suspension should be announced on Friday. As far as FIFA officials and veteran journalists could remember, this was the first time a goalie was ejected from a World Cup game. . . . Italy's trainer said defenders FRANCO BARESI and PAOLO MALDINI were injured severely enough that they would miss next Tuesday's game.  WORLD CUP '94  Correction:  June 28, 1994, Tuesday</p>
        <p>A sports caption in some editions on Friday with a picture by Reuters showing the Italian soccer star Roberto Baggio misstated the timing of his removal from the match. It happened later than the scene shown.</p>
