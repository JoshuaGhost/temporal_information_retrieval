        <p>As prosecution and defense lawyers labored today to prepare for a preliminary hearing on Thursday on the murder charges facing O. J. Simpson, some indications emerged about how both sides view -- and may try -- the case.</p>
        <p>The prosecution said it would go beyond presenting just a skeleton of evidence, as is often the case in preliminary hearings.</p>
        <p>"The rules permit us just to put on the investigating officers," said Suzanne Childs, the spokeswoman for the District Attorney. "But we intend to put on other witnesses."</p>
        <p>When prosecutors present a parade of witnesses at a preliminary hearing, they are often trying to minimize the risk of having their case thrown out of court for lack of probable cause, even though they may tip their hand as to how much evidence they have.</p>
        <p>But sometimes the prosecutors present a little extra evidence in an effort to force the defense to tip its hand a bit as to how the case will unfold. Defense Says It's Ready</p>
        <p>Ms. Childs would not say why the prosecution adopted its strategy. But whatever the rationale, Mr. Simpson's defense team said it would not be fooled either way. Its investigators were seen at the suspect's home throughout the weekend, at one point taking pictures and making measurements in the driveway.</p>
        <p>That activity was another indication that the Simpson case would probably turn in good part on large batches of physical and forensic evidence that both sides have collected, among them extensive samples of blood and tissue.</p>
        <p>In fact, F. Lee Bailey, one of the lead defense lawyers, said this afternoon in a telephone interview that he would not be surprised if prosecutors sought to delay the preliminary hearing to be able to complete tests on some of the samples. In particular, he mentioned DNA tests, which in theory can pinpoint the origin of blood, tissue and hair but which still provoke considerable debate about their value in criminal proceedings.</p>
        <p>"Of course," Mr. Bailey added, "if they delay, they have to let O. J. out on bail because Thursday is the deadline for getting the preliminary hearing under way." High-Profile Case</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson, whose career in professional football and on television made him a familiar national figure long before he was arrested in the slaying of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and one of her friends, Ronald L. Goldman, is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and is being held without bail in the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment last Monday. Should he go to trial and be convicted, he could face life in prison and maybe even the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Ms. Childs said the prosecution intended to go through with the preliminary hearing on Thursday. "We'll be ready," she said.</p>
        <p>So will the defense, Mr. Bailey said.  "The prosecutors say they have the goods, so let 'em prove it," he said.  "That's our defense. Always has been. You say I've done something criminal -- prove it."</p>
        <p>If the preliminary hearing results in Mr. Simpson being bound over for trial, there will be no effort to defend him on grounds of insanity, as prosecutors -- and even a member of the defense team -- have speculated, Mr. Bailey added.</p>
        <p>He also said no attempt would be made to change the location of a trial, despite an avalanche of pretrial publicity that led a judge to halt a grand jury inquiry last week. Insanity Plea Is Dismissed</p>
        <p>"Speculation about an insanity plea is nonsense because in California the prosecution has to prove its case first before you even get to that question," Mr. Bailey said. "It's outrageous that they would talk this way and convict O. J. even before a trial has been held."</p>
        <p>As for requesting a new location for a trial -- a change of venue, in legal parlance -- Mr. Bailey said that would not be a realistic remedy.</p>
        <p>"You can't get far enough away to escape the impact of nationwide, and even international, publicity," he said. "This case is now known about from one coast to the other and then some."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey said Mr. Simpson had a credible alibi as to where he was on the night of June 12, when Ms. Simpson and Mr. Goldman were fatally slashed outside Ms. Simpson's condominium in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>"He says he was at home waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport," Mr. Bailey said. "So, if he was home, he couldn't have done it, could he?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey also insisted that Mr. Simpson was not fleeing when he led the police on a lengthy, televised freeway cavalcade that ended with his arrest at his home, also in Brentwood. A Chase in Slow Motion</p>
        <p>"You can't call it a chase when it went as slow as that ride went," Mr. Bailey argued. "That doesn't qualify as flight from anything. He said he was going home and he did go home. So, he wasn't running from doing something wrong."</p>
        <p>The preliminary hearing will be in Los Angeles Municipal Court before Judge Patti Jo McKay, who conducted Mr. Simpson's arraignment.</p>
        <p>In many instances, preliminary hearings last from a few minutes to a few hours, even when the charges are murder. But in a high-profile case like the Simpson case, there is always the possibility that the hearing could last days, maybe even weeks.</p>
        <p>How long will the Simpson case hearing run?</p>
        <p>"As long as it runs," Mr. Bailey replied. "We've got a lot of questions to ask. Let's see what they've got."</p>
        <p>Most preliminary hearings result in the accused being bound over for trial.</p>
        <p>"First, you must establish that a crime has been committed, which is easy enough in this case, what with the pictures of the slashed bodies," said Bradley W. Brunon, a prominent criminal-defense lawyer in Los Angeles. "Then you saddle suspicion on the accused, tie him or her to the crime -- suspicion at this point, not proof beyond reasonable doubt. Only about 1 in 100 times does the hearing result in the charges being thrown out."</p>
        <p>Another well-known Los Angeles defense lawyer, Danny Davis, said the preliminary hearing would also offer the defense an opportunity to "infect" the case with error, even if Mr. Simpson were sent on to trial.</p>
        <p>"What the defense has a chance to do," he explained, "is throw up as many roadblocks as it can and hope that somewhere along the line the judge rules wrong or the prosecution slips up. Then, when the trial actually starts, the defense can come in, point out the mistake and ask that the whole thing be thrown out. You get away with that twice -- and it has been done before -- and O. J. walks."</p>
        <p>Some members of the grand jury that was taken off the Simpson case have begun to talk about their experience, though none have been willing to be identified, since grand jury business is meant to be secret.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, one told The Los Angeles Times that though members of the panel had been warned not to watch, listen or read news reports about the Simpson case, some jurors had nevertheless learned about the police tapes on which Mr. Simpson curses and threatens his wife.</p>
        <p>"The only way you could avoid it was not watch TV," the juror was quoted as saying. "It was a surprise to us when it came on."</p>
        <p>Another juror told the newspaper that prosecutors had almost completed presenting their evidence when the order came down for the jury to stop work on the case. The juror said the panel had been shown pictures of the bodies of Ms. Simpson and Mr. Goldman and described them as shocking.</p>
        <p>"This crime was such a blood mess," the juror added.</p>
        <p>Still another juror said, "This was butchery, absolute butchery."</p>
