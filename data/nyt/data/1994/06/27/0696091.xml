        <p>A convoy of ancient North Korean trucks, some listing precariously under their brimming loads of sacks of Chinese rice, rumbled home recently over the one-lane bridge that spans the Tumen River here.</p>
        <p>The bridge and a half-dozen others like it along the 310-mile frontier with North Korea have become a critical lifeline for the Government of that country's President, Kim Il Sung.</p>
        <p>The $300 million in border trade between China and North Korea, part of the $735 million trade relationship between the two Communist stalwarts, is one reason China was reticent as the United States talked about sanctions on North Korea in response to its nuclear program.</p>
        <p>Ever more isolated these days, North Korea is leaning more and more on China to prop up its economy. That is evident here with the increasing shipments of food, fuel and other essential commodities across this frontier.</p>
        <p>So far, China's Communist Party leaders are signaling that they intend to stay as close to their longtime ally as "lips to teeth," an old party slogan that the Government has resurrected.</p>
        <p>A tough economic embargo would force China to shut down trade along this border, a move that local officials say would wipe out a third of this border region's economic output.</p>
        <p>"Any sanctions will only do harm to the peace of the area and it will not make the people of the region happy," said Chao Zhizhong, the deputy director of the state enterprise running the largest trade and barter business. "I am engaged in trade with North Korea, so of course I worry about it."</p>
        <p>Sun Jinhu, an official in the Government agency that supervises border trade, added, "We have the same political system and a long history of friendly relations with North Korea, and they depend on China as their elder brother."</p>
        <p>There are questions about whether China could enforce sanctions here, where smuggling is rampant. The Communist Party recently removed the mayor of a city in a neighboring province who was running a car smuggling operation.</p>
        <p>Clues to the porousness of the border are as common as the right-hand-drive taxicabs in the cities, all smuggled from Japan or Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>The river is a thin and unguarded boundary that in the winter can be breached by a short walk, or drive, across the ice.</p>
        <p>A tour of the Yanbian Korean Nationality Autonomous Prefecture, as this border enclave in Jilin Province is called, reveals a growing hub of commerce. Local industries manufactured $140 million worth of goods in 1993 that were sold across the border.</p>
        <p>Forty percent of the 2.1 million inhabitants of the Chinese prefecture are ethnic Koreans. Most residents speak Korean, which is taught in the schools and is pervasive in street signs, billboards and news broadcasts.</p>
        <p>Even local officials are astounded at the tenfold expansion of border trade in the last several years.</p>
        <p>Travel agencies in Seoul, South Korea, have been sending more than 15,000 tourists a year to Long White Hair Mountain, a volcanic peak that straddles the border and is the legendary birthplace of the Korean nation. With recently relaxed visa restrictions, the number is expected to reach 100,000 in 1994. Until China and South Korea re-established diplomatic relations last year, it was very difficult for South Koreans to make the pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>Now the most popular restaurants and nightclubs in Yanji, the prefecture's capital, are joint ventures with North or South Korean companies.</p>
        <p>The Korean market in Yanji is bursting with North Korean goods, proof of economic integration. Its vendors hawk the bountiful array of North Korean seafood, pastries and household goods.</p>
        <p>"I have been here 10 years now and business is very good," said Cui Hui Shu, a peddler, holding up the pelt of a North Korean red fox for which she was asking $75.</p>
        <p>At Man Kang Hotel in Yanji, a North Korean waitress was wearing a Kim Il Sung button.</p>
        <p>In Tumen, the number of convoys moving across this border is increasing, local officials say.</p>
        <p>During a recent visit to the border crossing, convoys carrying other staple grains followed the rice trucks. Then came four truckloads of Chinese beer.</p>
        <p>The trucks rumbled under a modern Chinese archway and onto the narrow 1,500-foot span to the North Korean border town of Namyang, which appeared drab and lifeless in the distance. The only sound from the North Korean side was the shrill whistle of a steam locomotive, whose antiquity sharpened the contrast with the bustling Chinese side.</p>
        <p>Tanker trucks of gasoline also pass this checkpoint to supplement North Korea's critically short supply. The shortage is shutting factories, causing the economy to contract further.  Loads of North Korean timber, steel, cement and seafood come back as barter payment.</p>
        <p>North Korea's mineral and seafood resources, under strict Government control, are exported because the state gets a good price for them. But people at the border reported that the workers get a meager dole of rice that is barely enough for two meals a day.</p>
        <p>A local official in Tumen said that all the evidence suggested that shortages were getting worse across the border. "But even though they have a food problem," he said, "they would never admit it."</p>
