        <p>Claudio Caniggia is one of several stars in their prime on the national team of Argentina, but he and the others live in the shadow of the aging Diego Armando Maradona. On and off the field, Maradona grabs the headlines. Few paid attention to Caniggia even last month, when he completed a 13-month suspension by FIFA after having tested positive for cocaine use.</p>
        <p>Caniggia's ban by the world governing body of soccer ended May 8. He immediately went to work and has brought his play to the level he achieved in the 1990 World Cup, when he was the most dangerous striker for his country in leading Argentina to the final.</p>
        <p>Caniggia showed his scoring prowess again in the 2-1 triumph over Nigeria Saturday at Foxboro Stadium in Massachusetts. He scored both goals for Argentina despite being bothered by a severely bruised toe.</p>
        <p>Argentines around the globe hope Caniggia will emulate Paolo Rossi, the diminutive Italian. Rossi came off a suspension in 1982 for allegedly fixing games and then led Italy to its third World Cup triumph. Trying to Get Fit</p>
        <p>"I'm Caniggia, I'm no Rossi," Caniggia said last week after a practice at Foxboro, where Argentina played its first two games of the World Cup. "I'm trying to get in shape to play the best I can."</p>
        <p>Wasting no time after the completion of his suspension, Caniggia played his first game May 9 and scored a goal in Roma's 3-1 victory over River Plate of Argentina in a four-team tournament in Buenos Aires.</p>
        <p>Like most of the top Argentine players, the 27-year-old Caniggia made his name playing overseas -- in his case in the Italian League. His exceptional speed and scoring ability make him one of the world's elite forwards.</p>
        <p>With his stringy blond hair flowing, a cigarette hanging off his lips, the skinny Caniggia looks more like a rock star than a soccer player. Put a soccer ball in front of him, however, and he turns into a deadly striker.</p>
        <p>Against Nigeria, Caniggia's scoring skill was clearly displayed when he pounced on a rebound for his first goal and when he picked his spot from an acute angle on the left for his winner. Only One Cover Boy</p>
        <p>But Maradona got most of the credit, having started both plays that led to the goals. Maradona was also the center of attention in Argentina's 4-0 victory over Greece last Tuesday even though Gabriel Batistuta scored three goals.</p>
        <p>Maradona grabbed headlines last fall when he became heavy and seemed questionable for the World Cup. He was back in the news four months ago when he fired pellets from an air gun at reporters and was not allowed to enter Japan because of a drug conviction.</p>
        <p>After the game against Greece, soccer fans throughout the world wanted to know how Maradona played in his first game in the World Cup, how much weight he lost, what earring he was wearing.</p>
        <p>"Diego deserves all the headlines, all the attention," Caniggia said. "He is Maradona. He has the magic name."</p>
        <p>Maradona gets the attention because he still does things only he can do. He has been the most recognized figure in soccer for a decade and almost single-handedly led Argentina to its World Cup triumph in 1986.</p>
        <p>Every country that has won the World Cup has had at least one exceptional player. In Caniggia and Batistuta, Argentina has an outstanding pair of strikers to complement Maradona, who has lost a step.</p>
        <p>"I have a feeling that great things await Argentina," Caniggia said after the victory over Nigeria. "Now, we are certain to move to the next round. This was Argentina's best game."</p>
        <p>Argentina's superiority was plain against Nigeria despite the physical tactics employed by the Super Eagles. Argentina Coach Alfio (Coso) Basile said after the game that five or six of his players were hurt because of Nigeria's rough play.</p>
        <p>"Our team went out there and played against Mike Tyson," Maradona said. "It was a fight, not a game."</p>
        <p>Nigeria committed 33 of the game's 38 fouls, a number of them rather violent, leaving Maradona, Caniggia, Fernando Caseres, Roberto Sensini and Diego Simeone hurting after the game.</p>
        <p>Maradona took the hardest hit, in the face. He said he was afraid that he might have suffered a broken jaw.</p>
        <p>"I'm beaten up all over," Maradona said. "The referee did not employ fair play."  WORLD CUP '94</p>
