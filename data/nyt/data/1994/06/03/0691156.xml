        <p>Observing the customary edict to be brief on an occasion where a full stand-up routine might have been welcomed, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld spoke at Queens College's commencement yesterday for only two minutes (and three jokes), telling the graduates that one of his most poignant memories as a student there was the time he found a parking spot near the campus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seinfeld, Class of '76, said he had "a lot of other wonderful memories" of Queens College and its theater department, "which allowed me to pursue independent study here in stand-up comedy."</p>

        <p>Observing the customary edict to be brief on an occasion where a full stand-up routine might have been welcomed, the comedian Jerry Seinfeld spoke at Queens College's commencement yesterday for only two minutes (and three jokes), telling the graduates that one of his most poignant memories as a student there was the time he found a parking spot near the campus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seinfeld, Class of '76, said he had "a lot of other wonderful memories" of Queens College and its theater department, "which allowed me to pursue independent study here in stand-up comedy."</p>
        <p>"I feel that worked out pretty good," added the comedian, the star of the NBC-TV series "Seinfeld."</p>
        <p>Under crisp blue skies, 3,300 graduates marched onto the main quadrangle at the Flushing campus, with perhaps 10,000 friends and family members applauding. The crowd cheered as 11 members of the Class of 1944, in golden gowns, proceeded toward the platform.</p>
        <p>"Who would have thought that I would be the opening act for Jerry Seinfeld?" the Queens Borough President, Claire Shulman, said. She then commended Shirley Strum Kenny, who after nine years as Queens College president is to take the helm at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.</p>
        <p>Mr. Seinfeld, after receiving an honorary doctorate in humane letters, told the graduates, who responded with knowing laughter: "I spent several wonderful years here. The best spot I ever got was in my junior year. It was right out here on Kissena Boulevard near Melbourne Avenue. I didn't even have to parallel; I pulled right in. It was a beautiful spot."</p>
        <p>"My only regret," Mr. Seinfeld continued, "is if I could have foreseen that I would be standing here today, when my parents were pushing me to become a doctor, I could have at least said to them, 'All right, all right, just let me tell jokes to strangers in nightclubs for 18 years and I'm sure after that they'll make me a doctor.' "</p>
        <p>Also receiving an honorary doctorate was George Temmer, a professor emeritus of physics at Rutgers University who calculated the shortest time interval ever measured -- 10 to the minus 18 seconds -- by determining how fast nuclear particles move through a particular crystal.  Baruch College</p>
        <p>Henry Cisneros, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, urged Baruch College graduates yesterday to work to eliminate what he called "American apartheid."</p>
        <p>In a commencement address at the Paramount Theater, Mr. Cisneros spoke of urban problems like drugs, crime and teen-age pregnancy, then asked the graduates and their relatives and friends if they would commit to making change.</p>
        <p>"How is it that there are people in this nation still living in conditions that would shame Third World countries?" he asked. "How is it that parents are being forced to raise their children in what can only be called war zones?</p>
        <p>"This is happening in America today," he said, "because 40 years after the Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. the Board of Education that separate facilities are inherently unequal, we still live in a society divided into racially separate communities that are inherently unequal."</p>
        <p>The college awarded him an honorary doctor of laws degree, and honorary degrees to David Driskell, a painter and art scholar, and Koji Kakizawa, Japan's foreign minister. Lehman College</p>
        <p>Tempering his congratulations with a note of sorrow for low enrollments at City University, Herman Badillo, representing the City University trustees, urged graduates of Lehman College to take their success into the streets of New York and encourage younger people to stay in school.</p>
        <p>"In the past, the City University was the gateway to opportunity for the poor," Mr. Badillo said. "Today, we need you remain in your communities and inspire other young people to do what you have done."</p>
        <p>The college conferred 1,029 bachelor's and 371 master's degrees. Long Island University</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn Campus of Long Island University conferred 1,100 graduate and undergraduate degrees on Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. A Brooklyn native, Associate Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the Supreme Court, received an honorary doctor of laws degree.</p>
        <p>Also receiving honorary degrees were the commencement speaker, Judith Heumann, class of 1969, assistant secretary of special education and rehabilitative services in Washington; Dr. Benjamin S. Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon; the band leader Tito Puente; Edward Stack, director of the Clark Foundation; Robert Spector, an author, and Borough President Howard Golden of Brooklyn.</p>
