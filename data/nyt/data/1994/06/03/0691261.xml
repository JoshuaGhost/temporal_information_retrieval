        <p>"The Slingshot" takes a light-handed approach to the idea that surviving childhood may be the toughest part of life. Though every coming-of-age story has a personal quirk, this one is built on a most particular identity crisis. "Can you be a Jew and a socialist?" wonders 10-year-old Roland, who is doubly persecuted in the Sweden of the 1920's. Once he has solved that problem, he goes on to ask, "How do I know I was meant to be Swedish?"</p>
        <p>Roland's father is a socialist with heroic illusions and a serious limp; his mother is a Russian-born Jew, an idealist who sells condoms illegally; his older brother is an aspiring boxer who practices on Roland's nose instead of a punching bag. Roland's other problems include ordinary sexual curiosity, a sadistic anti-Semitic teacher and being teased by bullying older boys. It's a wonder he survived at all.</p>

        <p>"The Slingshot" takes a light-handed approach to the idea that surviving childhood may be the toughest part of life. Though every coming-of-age story has a personal quirk, this one is built on a most particular identity crisis. "Can you be a Jew and a socialist?" wonders 10-year-old Roland, who is doubly persecuted in the Sweden of the 1920's. Once he has solved that problem, he goes on to ask, "How do I know I was meant to be Swedish?"</p>
        <p>Roland's father is a socialist with heroic illusions and a serious limp; his mother is a Russian-born Jew, an idealist who sells condoms illegally; his older brother is an aspiring boxer who practices on Roland's nose instead of a punching bag. Roland's other problems include ordinary sexual curiosity, a sadistic anti-Semitic teacher and being teased by bullying older boys. It's a wonder he survived at all.</p>
        <p>Ake Sandgren's winsome film, which opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, is based on an autobiographical novel by Roland Schutt. The film's immense visual clarity -- bright light illuminating the picturesque landscape and the dark wood of cluttered interiors -- reflects the hero's attitude. Roland senses that life is too complicated, but he never whines and the film is never sentimental. As Roland walks along a snowy street with his father, they pass trolley tracks, horse-drawn carts and the occasional car, all suggesting that the century itself is at a crossroads. Poor Roland is buffeted by it.</p>
        <p>Early in the story, some mean older boys dare him to put his tongue on a lamppost, and his mother has to release him with the help of a blowtorch. "Time for some fried Jew-nose," one boy sneers, and from then on Roland is rarely without a bloody nose from one source or another.</p>
        <p>His mother sells a socialist paper, "Red Voices," and after she begins selling condoms, Roland becomes an inventor. The film's liveliest moments come from his enterprising ideas. He stretches a condom over his foot, immerses it in a bucket of water, and announces to himself: "The Underwater Sock, by Roland Schutt." When he tries to sell condom-slingshots at school, it's another excuse for the teacher to beat him. One of his father's fiercest lessons is that Roland must learn to take all of life's beatings, physical and verbal, with his eyes open.</p>
        <p>Scene for scene, "The Slingshot" achieves just the right tones: it is tough and political when Roland defies his teacher; comic when he sells his condom inventions; gently sad when this child of two socialists shows his kitten a bike he bartered for, saying: "That's mine. Do you get it? That's mine." By giving Roland's large and small crises equal importance, Mr. Sandgren purposefully captures the quality of daily life. But that is also the problem with "The Slingshot." Whenever it seems about to explore one issue in some depth, the film moves on to another and never accumulates the weight or feeling it promises.</p>
        <p>Jesper Salen is ideal as Roland. The wide-eyed boy is defiant to the end, even after he is duped by the older boys and made to take the blame for petty crimes he was too innocent to know he was committing. But for all his idiosyncrasies, this Jewish-socialist-Swedish hero is finally too much like many other film characters. "The Slingshot" is a bit like "Europa, Europa" and a bit like "My Life as a Dog." Its freeze-frame ending suggests Mr. Sandgren has seen "The 400 Blows" one time too many. Though "The Slingshot" doesn't have the spark of originality that set those other films apart, it has inherited much of their alluring style.</p>
        <p>"The Slingshot" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual innuendo, a couple of slightly bloody accidents and a glimpse of a drowned corpse.</p>
