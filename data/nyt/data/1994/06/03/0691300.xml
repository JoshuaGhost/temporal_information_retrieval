        <p>Alberto Giacometti 'Early Works in Paris (1922-1930)'</p>
        <p>Yoshii Gallery  20 West 57th Street  Through June 25</p>
        <p>This small, outstanding exhibition should not be missed by anyone interested in modern sculpture. Its subject is the period of Giacometti's apprenticeship in Paris, when he was restlessly searching for a direction and pursuing remarkably diverse paths at the same time.</p>
        <p>A viewer can't help being powerfully struck by Giacometti's extreme openness: to African, Cycladic, Aztec and Oceanic art, to Picasso, Lipchitz, Laurens and Brancusi, not to say to more traditional modes of European sculpture. In 1922, he went to Paris and signed up for life-drawing and sculpture classes with Antoine Bourdelle, an esteemed disciple of Rodin, at the Academie de la Grande-Chaumiere. The nude figure drawings, the product of this academic training, describe volumes of bodies through a network of connected points and faceted planes. They look back to Cezanne and to early Cubism. They also hint at the eroticism and nervous energy that would come to characterize Giacometti's mature art.</p>
        <p>"Torso" was his first important sculpture. Its trunklike, angular and tensile form is like a rougher, more energized female counterpart to Brancusi's famous "Torso of a Youth" that nonetheless retains the phallic connotation. Giacometti also made Cubist sculptures composed of tightly compacted shards and blocks with figural references: the barrel shape in "Cubist Composition" seems to lean affectionately into a kind of boxy form, suggesting two lovers' heads.</p>
        <p>In these years he made open, scaffolded works, too, the gridded "Man (Apollo)" among them, which are indebted to African sculpture and also have something of the quality of drawings in space. And he invented the radical thin slabs of the Plaques: simplified, Cycladic-inspired near-reliefs, with their subtly hollowed shapes as abstracted signs for eyes or noses. "The idea of cold eroticism emerges in the 'Plaques,' " observes Casimiro Di Crescenzo, the show's curator, in his extensively documented catalogue. (A monograph on the artist, edited by Angela Schneider, has recently been published in an English edition by Prestel and includes an essay by Karin von Mauer on Giacometti's early years.)</p>
        <p>The Plaques helped to secure Giacometti's reputation and led to a show with Miro and Arp, and to his association with the Surrealists. By 1930, still only 29, he was a rising star in Paris. Later, he tried to minimize what he had done in the 1920's. (At the same time, he had bronze casts made of many of these early works.) In any case, the energy and invention that one senses from the works in this show are undeniable and inspiring. Every young artist should see the exhibition. MICHAEL KIMMELMAN</p>
