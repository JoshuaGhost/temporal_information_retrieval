        <p>I've been sitting here staring out at the Gulf of Mexico, watching row after row of powerful waves tumble onto the beach.</p>
        <p>At any moment I expect to see Knick bodies washing up on shore. It appears the Knicks have been kicked aside and left for dead after a loss to Indiana on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The Gulf is more than a thousand miles from New York, but I can feel the shock waves emanating from Madison Square Garden, where Knicks fans watched Reggie Miller put on one of the greatest shooting exhibitions in National Basketball Association playoff history. All the king's horses, all the king's men -- not even Spike Lee -- couldn't pull the Knicks together.</p>
        <p>From what I've heard, folks are blaming the Brooklyn-born film director for Miller's 25-point fourth-quarter explosion.</p>
        <p>Antonio Davis, Indiana's forward, said Lee was definitely a factor.</p>
        <p>"I think it was Spike Lee; tell him thanks for us," Davis said. "Reggie is the king of talk and Spike definitely said something that set him off. I'm not sure what it was."</p>
        <p>I was curious, too. The sound on my television was turned down for most of the game and I was in the middle of listening to an Eric Dolphy-John Coltrane rendition of "Naima" when I noticed Miller and Lee woofing vociferously at each other. By now the Knicks' 14-point lead had been cut to 2 points.</p>
        <p>After another Knicks turnover -- they had 26 for the game which would seem to have more to do with losing than a filmmaker's provocation -- Miller made a jumper from what seemed like Seventh Avenue. He looked over and gave the choke sign to Lee, then reached down and made an obscene gesture toward Lee and his wife.</p>
        <p>Forgetting that this was Miller's movie and not his, Lee protested to the official, asking him to penalize Miller for unsportsmanlike conduct. What did Lee say to make Miller so angry?</p>
        <p>"I had nothing to do with it," Lee said by phone from the Brooklyn headquarters of his production company, 40 Acres and a Mule. "I'm not wearing a uniform. I'm 5-6, 125 pounds. He needs me to get fired up? Why couldn't he go to Ewing or Starks or Oakley. Why me? After he scored a basket he wasn't thinking about getting back on 'D' or looking for his man, he was staring at me."</p>
        <p>The dialogue between Miller and Lee began in Games 1 and 2, and continued in Game 5 during the first half. "All I said was that I'm going to see you in Indianapolis," Lee explained.  "Whenever he went to the foul line in the fourth quarter I just said 'Reggie. Reggie.' I never talked about his momma or anything. But from then on every time he hit a basket he stared at me. It escalated from there and pretty soon the roof caved in."</p>
        <p>The Knicks' roof is on fire, no question about it. But I hope that writers and fans will have a little mercy on them. This team, after all, is a creation of our collective aspirations and desires to have champions. We invented them.</p>
        <p>One of the difficulties of working in New York in the public's eye is that the competition to disseminate information is so intense that it's a virtual lock that everything -- wretched as well as noble -- will be blown out of proportion.</p>
        <p>The Knicks are not as wretched as everyone is accusing them of being, and they were never as good as everyone proclaimed.</p>
        <p>"We're going to win this series," Lee promised. "I'll be in Indiana at 7 A.M. on Friday, wearing a John Starks jersey. And I'm going to talk to Reggie."</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets trickled into their hotel this morning in preparation for three days of fine tuning in this relaxed beachfront setting.</p>
        <p>With New York on the ropes, however, the Rockets' stay here will not bring as much peace of mind as they had hoped.</p>
        <p>Houston shed its Choke City image with an impressive victory over Utah, and was looking forward to vanquishing the image for good with a victory over New York in the championship series.</p>
        <p>The team, the fans -- even city officials, who have said that a series against New York would bring more revenue and attention to Houston than one against Indiana -- have put so much emotional energy into a potential series with the Knicks that an Indiana victory will throw the Rockets' emotional gyroscope out of kilter.</p>
        <p>Houston could be set up for another heartbreak.</p>
        <p>Hakeem Olajuwon doesn't think so. After practice here yesterday, the Rockets' center spotted me and said, "What's wrong with your boys in New York?"</p>
        <p>I tried to make a case for a Knick comeback. Besides, I said, the people want to see Houston and New York.</p>
        <p>"I do, too," he said. "But I think it's too late. I think they're going to close them out."</p>
        <p>His opinion notwithstanding, and for all the hand-wringing and finger-pointing I know is taking place in New York, a Knicks-Rockets series is not out of the question.</p>
        <p>There's still hope. I'm looking at the waves crashing in and no bodies have washed ashore yet.</p>
