        <p>Concert promoters are calling this season the Summer of Greed. With Pink Floyd, the Eagles, Barbra Streisand, the Rolling Stones and the Billy Joel-Elton John team on the road, promoters predict that 1994 will be the concert industry's highest-grossing year, topping 1990's record of $1.1 billion in ticket sales for touring acts. For some bands, however, there is no worse time to be on the road than the present.</p>
        <p>"We are, no pun intended, in heavy traffic," said Ron Weisner, who manages Traffic, one of several bands that have reunited to tour this summer. "Some of the markets we've gone to have been milked to the bone prior to us even going on sale."</p>

        <p>Concert promoters are calling this season the Summer of Greed. With Pink Floyd, the Eagles, Barbra Streisand, the Rolling Stones and the Billy Joel-Elton John team on the road, promoters predict that 1994 will be the concert industry's highest-grossing year, topping 1990's record of $1.1 billion in ticket sales for touring acts. For some bands, however, there is no worse time to be on the road than the present.</p>
        <p>"We are, no pun intended, in heavy traffic," said Ron Weisner, who manages Traffic, one of several bands that have reunited to tour this summer. "Some of the markets we've gone to have been milked to the bone prior to us even going on sale."</p>
        <p>Since Traffic began touring last month, most of the places it has performed in have been less than half full. In some cities, the band has decided to open for the Grateful Dead instead of headlining its own concerts.</p>
        <p>There are more than a hundred tours to choose from this summer -- a few of them charging more than $100 a ticket -- and concertgoers are getting picky. When the Rolling Stones put their $25-to-$50 tickets on sale in selected cities last month, sales were said to be slower than expected, and few shows sold out in a day (though in New York, where ticket sales tend to fare better than elsewhere, two of the Stones' shows at Giants Stadium, on Aug. 12 and 14, did sell out in a 90 minutes; a third show, also sold out, has since been added for Aug. 16). Tickets for Rolling Stones dates in California, South Carolina and elsewhere are still available. Plans to add extra shows in several cities were reportedly abandoned. Sellouts Are What Matter</p>
        <p>"With the high volume of tours and the high cost of tickets, it takes a longer quantity of time to sell out," said Michael Cohl, head of Concert Productions International, the Toronto-based company that is handling the Rolling Stones tour. "The only question I'm concerned with is whether the Stones sell out, and all of the shows are at least nearly there."</p>
        <p>The Rolling Stones and Traffic aren't the only bands feeling the pinch. A Billy Joel-Elton John concert in Cleveland was canceled and an Eagles concert in Buffalo was moved to a smaller site because of slow ticket sales, although both tours have been doing brisk business in other cities.</p>
        <p>Peter Gabriel's traveling music and art festival, Womad, canceled several planned stops and also switched to smaller arenas in New York and Los Angeles after tickets went on sale. The heavy-metal band Scorpions and the pop singer Richard Marx moved some concerts to smaller stages after lackluster ticket sales. Groups that are touring for their second summer in a row, including the Steve Miller Band, the Beach Boys (who canceled some shows this year), Depeche Mode and Santana, are also experiencing languid sales. Business in the Southeast has been especially slow, with some top acts selling under half the available seats.</p>
        <p>"This is an unusual year because there are so many stadium shows," said Bob Grossweiner, New York bureau chief for the concert trade journal Performance. "We're going to see blockbuster records in terms of money, but when you add it up at the end of the summer, attendance might be down." The Better Part of Valor</p>
        <p>Some musicians have backed out of this summer's battle of the bands. The rock singer Boz Scaggs postponed his tour because, according to a statement from his record label, Virgin, ticket sales were soft. Tom Petty, Lenny Kravitz and Emerson, Lake and Palmer, all of whom were expected to release albums and tour this summer, decided to spend more time in the studio before going on the road, their record labels said. (Mr. Kravitz will be opening some shows for the Rolling Stones.)</p>
        <p>Roger Daltrey, who was to begin his tour in June, won't take to the road until late July, after his new album is released. "Now we're going to miss the big crunch, which is June and July," said Richard Flanzer, Mr. Daltrey's manager. "When we go out, there's only the Rolling Stones."</p>
        <p>Even the recent industry trend of packaging several popular acts together on one tour hasn't guaranteed strong sales. Only Lollapalooza, an alternative rock festival featuring the Beastie Boys, Smashing Pumpkins and many others, has been a hot ticket. The Horde festival, featuring the Allman Brothers Band and Blues Traveler, has had disapointing sales in some cities, while the Southern Spirit Tour, featuring the Fabulous Thunderbirds and Marshall Tucker, had to discount tickets. Creative pairings -- including Foreigner with the Doobie Brothers, Lynyrd Skynyrd with Ted Nugent, and Crosby, Stills and Nash with Fleetwood Mac -- have failed to stimulate strong ticket sales.</p>
        <p>John Scher, chairman of the New Jersey-based promotion company Metropolitan Entertainment, said: "The people that are getting hurt are the weaker acts. As a promoter, you try to be realistic with regard to the traffic that's out there. With bands that aren't hot, you tell them to stay home and wait until the fall." Cycles and Chance</p>
        <p>Like other concert promoters, Mr. Scher attributed the summer glut to the cyclical nature of the concert business and to coincidence. "When people made their touring plans this summer," he said, "nobody believed that Streisand would tour, that hell would freeze over and the Eagles would tour, that the Stones and Pink Floyd would go out at the same time, and that there would be a pairing of Billy Joel and Elton John."</p>
        <p>Even though some tickets are proving to be a hard sell, promoters and managers have yet to find a limit to what people will pay to see a popular act. They note that scalpers have been getting prices upward of $500 for tickets for some time and that expensive seats tend to sell more quickly than cheap seats. The Streisand concerts, which have been sellouts, have a top ticket price of $350; the Eagles' top is $119.25, Pink Floyd's, $75. One promoter said that some bands, while keeping price ranges the same, had been increasing the number of high-priced seats at the expense of cheaper ones.</p>
        <p>Some acts, like Brooks and Dunn, Soundgarden and the Grateful Dead,have been trying to keep their ticket prices to a minimum this summer. Although prices are generally determined by the bands and their managers, Pearl Jam recently discovered that there is a limit to how low prices can go. The Seattle rock band wanted to keep ticket prices for a summer tour (which it has canceled) at $18 or below and surcharges at a maximum of $1.80. Ticketmaster, the country's largest ticket distribution agency, typically charges between $5 and $10 in processing and phone-service fees. When Pearl Jam was unable to book a single date, the band filed a complaint with the Justice Department's antitrust division on May 6, accusing Ticketmaster of organizing a boycott against the band and exercising a monopoly over ticket distribution. Ticketmaster has denied Pearl Jam's charges. The Justice Department has said it is investigating "anti-competitive practices in the ticket distribution industry."</p>
        <p>Louis Messina, chairman of Pace Music Group, a Houston-based concert promotion company, predicts that ticket prices will come down next summer. "Ticket prices are all artist-driven," he said, "and this year, competing promoters and agents bid the artists up high."</p>
        <p>Mr. Messina predicts a slow autumn. "There's talk of Eric Clapton coming out this fall," he said, "but there are not that many decent bands left to play. It's very light so far."</p>
        <p>Promoters are not making any predictions for next summer. But no one has forgotten what happened in 1991, the year after the concert industry hit its all-time high. Concert halls closed, promoters went bankrupt and the industry experienced its worst year ever.</p>
