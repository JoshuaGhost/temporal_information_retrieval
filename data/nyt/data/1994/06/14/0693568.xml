        <p>Workout for the von Beckerath Before It Is Worked On  St. Michael's Episcopal Church</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old von Beckerath organ in St. Michael's Church has a wonderfully bright, clear sound, and in the hope of keeping it that way, the church is about to disassemble it and ship it to Hamburg, Germany, for preventative maintenance and refurbishing.

        <p>Workout for the von Beckerath Before It Is Worked On  St. Michael's Episcopal Church</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old von Beckerath organ in St. Michael's Church has a wonderfully bright, clear sound, and in the hope of keeping it that way, the church is about to disassemble it and ship it to Hamburg, Germany, for preventative maintenance and refurbishing. There are a few recitals scheduled before the organ's departure, however, and on Sunday evening the von Beckerath was given a strenuous road test by Harald Vogel, a specialist in North German Baroque music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vogel devoted the first half of his New York debut program to works by a handful of J. S. Bach's predecessors, role models and contemporaries. Bach had the second half of the program to himself. With the exception of Buxtehude, whose music has a life of its own, Bach's predecessors are often presented as historical footnotes, dry and somewhat severe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vogel, a vivid colorist and an inventive, energetic interpreter, seemed intent on overturning that impression. In works by Matthias Weckmann and Vincent Lubeck, he drew liberally on the 55-rank organ's registrational palette, differentiating between sections of a piece with radical changes in timbre. In a Praeludium in D minor by Lubeck and pieces by Buxtehude, Nicolaus Bruhns and Georg Bohm, his crisp articulation made the counterpoint both transparent and, at times, almost tactile.</p>
        <p>At first, his Bach seemed staid by comparison. Yet if his coloration was generally less dramatic than in the earlier works, there were compensations, among them the fluidity and detail he brought to the Prelude and Fugue in G minor (BWV 535), and an electrifyingly brisk, ornately voiced approach to the Fugue from the Fantasie and Fugue in G minor (BWV 542).
