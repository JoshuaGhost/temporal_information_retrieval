        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am really disgusted. On May 15 there were three articles about biking and not one expressed any concern for the safety of pedestrians.</p>
        <p>Central Park, the subject of one of the articles ("Ban the Cars! A Historical Plea."), was created mainly for the enjoyment of pedestrians. Remember us? But try crossing the park drive on a weekend! The bikers pay no attention to the 15 mile-an-hour speed limit, and they don't give us pedestrians a chance.</p>
        <p>Countless adults and chldren, including one of my own, have been hit by bikers in Central Park. A co-worker was crossing the street on Fifth Avenue when she was struck by a biker and wound up in intensive care.</p>
        <p>Why doesn't the Parks Department take some real responsibility for solving the problem? If the department can't enforce the bikers' speed limit, at least enforce stopping at red lights. Would that deprive bikers of some aerobic intensity? Tough noogies!  FRANCINE JACOBS  Manhattan</p>
