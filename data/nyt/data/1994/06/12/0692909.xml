        <p>THE Americans With Disabilities Act was signed into law almost four years ago, but to date the question of whether it can be enforced on foreign-registered cruise ships remains unanswered.  The cruise lines, with their eyes on the 80 percent of their passengers who are Americans, may beat the law to the punch, which would suit wheelchair users and probably the Department of Justice, too. Expert examination of vessels shows increasing awareness of what makes a cabin accessible.</p>
        <p>A.D.A., the far-reaching civil rights act enacted in July 1990, will in time encompass all components of travel: airports, trains, places of accommodation and entertainment and even long-distance buses. The Department of Justice has determined that it applies to passenger vessels with "places of public accommodation," including sightseeing boats, ferries, riverboats and floating restaurants. The Departments of Justice and Transportation are emphatic that the law also applies to cruise ships, "a hybrid of a transportation service and a public accommodation." But applying it to ocean-going cruise vessels is more complex, because virtually all the 140 ships that call at United States ports are registered in foreign countries, and Government agencies point out that enforcement steps might conflict with treaties with the countries of registry.</p>

        <p>THE Americans With Disabilities Act was signed into law almost four years ago, but to date the question of whether it can be enforced on foreign-registered cruise ships remains unanswered.

Expert examination of vessels shows increasing awareness of what makes a cabin accessible.</p>
        <p>A.D.A., the far-reaching civil rights act enacted in July 1990, will in time encompass all components of travel: airports, trains, places of accommodation and entertainment and even long-distance buses. The Department of Justice has determined that it applies to passenger vessels with "places of public accommodation," including sightseeing boats, ferries, riverboats and floating restaurants. The Departments of Justice and Transportation are emphatic that the law also applies to cruise ships, "a hybrid of a transportation service and a public accommodation." But applying it to ocean-going cruise vessels is more complex, because virtually all the 140 ships that call at United States ports are registered in foreign countries, and Government agencies point out that enforcement steps might conflict with treaties with the countries of registry.</p>
        <p>In drawing up the regulations for the transportation sections of the law, the Department of Transportation postponed writing the parts on water transportation. It said in 1991 that no one had determined if the provisions of the disabilities act conflicted with any treaties, particularly the international convention on Safety of Life at Sea. The department said it would have to research this area and then write regulations that would avoid conflict.</p>
        <p>Since then, little progress has been made. The Department of Transportation is hoping to assign a research project on water transportation in the next 12 months. Robert C. Ashby of the department's legal staff said in an interview that the department knew some of the questions but so far had no answers. One example of a conflict he cited was Coast Guard safety requirements for the height of coamings, the ledges on ships' cabins, and other places. High coamings, especially on doors to decks, keep water from flowing into a compartment, but they also impede wheelchair passage. If steps and ramps are provided, these problems can be resolved, and some modern ships have worked their way around the coaming obstacle. Another question is how to safeguard wheelchair users in an emergency: that is, how to get them to their life jackets, or into lifeboats.</p>
        <p>The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, the Federal agency responsible for creating minimum guidelines for the disabilities act, will convene an advisory committee on water transportation next year, along with the Transportation Department. David Capozzi, director of technical information and service at the compliance board, said: "It's not at the top of the agenda." Mr. Ashby agreed things would not get moving until 1995.  Which Lines Measure Up</p>
        <p>Kevin M. Anthoney, president of Cruise Consultants International, a travel agency in Santa Monica, Calif., has made a specialty of measuring the crucial dimensions of cabins that cruise lines list as wheelchair-accessible. He said that many lines used blueprint dimensions, which in the case of doorways are often diminished by moldings and hinges. When he gets there with a tape measure, he is looking for a door wide enough for a 26-inch standard wheelchair to get through, 27 or 28 inches at least. He estimates that 70 to 80 percent of the figures used by the cruise lines are inaccurate, although this may not matter when, for example, a door is an inch narrower than the three-foot width given on a diagram.</p>
        <p>With the permission of the lines, Mr. Anthoney has measured and photographed 90 vessels, mostly in port.  His data are used in presentations to travel industry groups and have not been independently published. However, he has shared his information with the publisher-authors of two recent guides to accessibility: "Wheels and Waves" by Genie and George Aroyan, and "Travel Agent Guide to Wheelchair Cruise Travel" by Bill Cushing. Mr. Aroyan, a naval engineer, and his wife, a wheelchair user since childhood, have taken 15 cruises, inspecting as they go. They sent diagrams to the cruise lines and asked them to fill in specific measurements. They also used Mr. Anthoney's data.</p>
        <p>The adjoining chart represents data on which the Aroyans and Mr. Anthoney agree. It lists 36 cruise vessels with cabins that have doorways to the bathroom that will accommodate a 26-inch-wide standard wheelchair. Some vessels with wide doorways have been omitted because the ramp to the bathroom is too steep for easy access, in the experts' view. Many cabins that the lines list as "accessible" specify that a less comfortable 22-inch portable wheelchair be used. Independent access to the bathroom in the user's regular chair, all experts agree, is what dictates whether a cruise is comfortable for a wheelchair user. A few vessels that qualified on the basis of measurements have been omitted from the chart because Mr. Aroyan and Mr. Anthoney considered them too crowded for wheelchair users to enjoy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anthoney, like others, cites Holland America Lines and Princess as giving serious attention to passengers with special needs. The Statendam and the Maasdam of Holland America have six accessible cabins each, and the Rhinedam, now being built, will also have six. Princess Cruises' Sun Princess, also under construction, is to have 12 accessible cabins, and the 100,000-ton liner to follow will have 28. Two Guides to Accessibility</p>
        <p>"Wheels and Waves: A Cruise, Ferry, River and Canal Barge Guide for the Physically Handicapped" was published in hard and soft cover in October 1993 by the Aroyans' company, Wheels Aweigh, 17105 San Carlos Boulevard, Suite A-6107, Fort Myers Beach, Fla. 33931; $19.95 for the hard cover; $13.95 for the paperback, postage included. The book has charts with dimensions -- not always complete -- and information on whether a ship's tender will accept wheelchairs, which can make a crucial difference in harbors too shallow for docking. Accessible cabins are identified by room number. Chapters list specialized travel agencies.</p>
        <p>"Travel Agent Guide to Wheelchair Cruise Travel" by Bill Cushing, a travel agent who has retired several times but is working again, was published in 1993 by TAG Publishing, Post Office Box 1046, Camarillo, Calif. 93011. The cost is $19.95 plus $2 shipping. Each vessel gets a chart on the basis of the lines' information and Mr. Anthoney's data.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anthoney's company, Cruise Consultants International, 1527 Yale Street, Suite 3, Santa Monica, Calif. 90404, does not seek out wheelchair users as clients because he does not use a wheelchair and says he is not sufficiently qualified. He lectures and writes on his research.  PRACTICAL TRAVELER  Correction:  June 19, 1994, Sunday</p>
        <p>The Practical Traveler column last Sunday about cruise ship accommodations for the disabled described Cruise Consultants International of Santa Monica, Calif., incompletely. In addition to being a travel agency, it consults with cruise companies on travel for the disabled.</p>
