        <p>Since its release six years ago, "Die Hard" has spawned a batch of blatant imitators. Among the essentials for a "Die Hard" clone: a tightly confined setting, a lone-gun-type hero and a game of cat-and-mouse. Not to mention considerable gunplay and pyrotechnics.</p>
        <p>These movies also have another common thread: they have revived actors' stalled careers. Bruce Willis was considered a turn-off to audiences when "Die Hard" was released in 1988. Sylvester Stallone's career was on the ropes when he starred in "Cliffhanger." Steven Seagal didn't click with mainstream moviegoers until "Under Siege." And now Keanu Reeves's career may get a lift out of "Speed" (which opened on Friday) because the role finds him prancing about in a tight T-shirt showing off his new physique (a "Die Hard" essential).</p>

        <p>These movies also have another common thread: they have revived actors' stalled careers. Bruce Willis was considered a turn-off to audiences when "Die Hard" was released in 1988. Sylvester Stallone's career was on the ropes when he starred in "Cliffhanger." Steven Seagal didn't click with mainstream moviegoers until "Under Siege." And now Keanu Reeves's career may get a lift out of "Speed" (which opened on Friday) because the role finds him prancing about in a tight T-shirt showing off his new physique (a "Die Hard" essential).</p>
        <p>As for other "Die Hard" knockoffs, they include the recent "Beverly Hills Cop III" ("Die Hard" in an amusement park), and several movies in the works: "Avalanche" ("Die Hard" in a cabin), "20 Minutes" ("Die Hard" in a Las Vegas casino), "Maelstrom" ("Die Hard" in a hurricane) and, of course, "Simon Says: Die Hard 3" and "Under Siege II: In Dark Territory."
