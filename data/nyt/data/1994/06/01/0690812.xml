        <p>A Federal grand jury indicted Representative Dan Rostenkowski today on 17 criminal charges, accusing him of engaging in a two-decade pattern of corruption, including the embezzlement of more than $500,000 from his official expense accounts "to benefit himself, his family and his friends."</p>
        <p>The broad felony indictment charges Mr. Rostenkowski with fraud, concealing material facts, tampering with a witness and conspiracy. Prosecutors said Mr. Rostenkowski would be arraigned within two weeks. The most serious charge, tampering with a witness, carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.</p>

        <p>A Federal grand jury indicted Representative Dan Rostenkowski today on 17 criminal charges, accusing him of engaging in a two-decade pattern of corruption, including the embezzlement of more than $500,000 from his official expense accounts "to benefit himself, his family and his friends."</p>
        <p>The broad felony indictment charges Mr. Rostenkowski with fraud, concealing material facts, tampering with a witness and conspiracy. Prosecutors said Mr. Rostenkowski would be arraigned within two weeks. The most serious charge, tampering with a witness, carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and $250,000 in fines.</p>
        <p>Under House Democratic Caucus rules, the indictment means that the Congressman must immediately relinquish his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee to the senior Democrat on the panel, Sam M. Gibbons of Florida.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gibbons, 74, will serve as acting chairman until Mr. Rostenkowski's case is resolved or the chairman leaves Congress. Unlike Mr. Rostenkowski, Mr. Gibbons is not considered a political deal-maker and, in 32 years in Congress, has emerged as something of a loner.  [ Page B7. ]</p>
        <p>Mr. Rostenkowski has dominated the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee with a hard-nosed style and legislative mastery for more than 13 years. He had been expected to play a crucial role in the legislative battle over President Clinton's health care plan, as well as over major tax, trade and welfare measures.</p>
        <p>The United States Attorney who presented the case to the grand jury, Eric H. Holder Jr., said at a news conference: "The allegations contained in today's indictment represent a betrayal of the public trust for personal gain. In essence, this indictment alleges that Congressman Rostenkowski used his elective office to perpetuate an extensive fraud on the American people."</p>
        <p>Mr. Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, did not comment today, nor did his defense lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, whose relations with his client seemed to be seriously strained after last week's collapse of negotiations for a plea agreement. Mr. Bennett had advised Mr. Rostenkowski to accept a tentative agreement that he arranged, but the lawmaker refused.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued on Monday evening through the Ways and Means Committee, the 66-year-old lawmaker said he would fight any charges against him, insisting they were false. "Truth," he said, "is on my side."</p>
        <p>Some of the accusations in the indictment had already been disclosed, like those that Mr. Rostenkowski took cash payments disguised as office purchases of stamps from the House post office from January 1978 to April 1991. The indictment said that Mr. Rostenkowski had received at least $50,000 this way and that he had handled the expense records used to conceal the illegal payments.</p>
        <p>Other accusations in the indictment had not been previously disclosed, including what prosecutors said was a kickback scheme in which Mr. Rostenkowski since 1971 hired 14 employees who performed little or no work or performed personal services for him, like mowing the lawn at his summer home in Wisconsin or taking photographs at his daughters' weddings. Employee Checks</p>
        <p>Several employees were required to submit their Government salary checks to Mr. Rostenkowski's Chicago office manager, who then disbursed cash to the employees in amounts less than the face value of their paychecks, the indictment said. The indictment did not indicate how the funds withheld by the office manager were used.</p>
        <p>Another new accusation involved what prosecutors said was an attempt by Mr. Rostenkowski in September 1993 to dissuade a witness from cooperating with the grand jury investigating the Congressman. The witness was an engraver who had inscribed plaques for crystal sculptures that Mr. Rostenkowski charged on his expense account at the House stationery shop but never paid for.</p>
        <p>Altogether, the indictment said, Mr. Rostenkowski charged more than $40,000 in goods at the stationery store for himself or his family from April 1988 to January 1992, including hand-painted chairs, fine china, crystal and luggage.</p>
        <p>The fresh charges underscored the overall impression that the prosecution's case included more serious charges and reflected a broader array of accusations of illegal conduct than had previously been known.</p>
        <p>The prospect of criminal charges had hung over Mr. Rostenkowski for months, creating an agonizing wave of doubt among his fellow Democrats about what his departure would mean for the health care legislation, the main issue under consideration by his powerful committee and a top priority on President Clinton's domestic agenda.</p>
        <p>If the indictment took few people by surprise, the scale of abuses it outlined and the multiplicity of felony counts seemed to stun some of Mr. Rostenkowski's staunchest allies, who offered careful comments that neither criticized nor strongly supported him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's comments were typical. "Like all Americans, Chairman Rostenkowski has the right to contest the charges made against him and to have his day in court," the President said. "Chairman Rostenkowski and others have helped create real momentum for health care reform, and I am confident that legislation will pass this year."</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Rostenkowski's colleagues said he was indispensable, a big-city politician who alone could hold the unruly committee together on a divisive issue like overhauling the health care system and how to pay for it. But today, other House leaders, including Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader, predicted a health care bill would pass this year without Mr. Rostenkowski as head of the panel.</p>
        <p>"This is an issue that transcends committee politics and procedure," Mr. Gephardt said in a statement. "And I'm fully confident we will have a bill on the floor of the House in the coming months."</p>
        <p>Some officials said Mr. Rostenkowski, who can retain both his Congressional seat and membership on the Ways and Means Committee while his case proceeds, might continue to play a significant role on health care from the sidelines. But several colleagues said that his influence would ebb without his title because he could no longer control the committee's agenda or staff and would have to prepare to fight the charges against him.</p>
        <p>The criminal inquiry that led to the felony indictment of Mr. Rostenkowski began in 1991 as an investigation of low-paid employees at the House post office who were accused of stealing small amounts of money from their cash drawers. Up the Ladder</p>
        <p>Prosecutors followed the investigative trail up the ranks, a path that eventually led to Robert V. Rota, the former House postmaster. In July 1993, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor embezzlement charges and implicated Mr. Rostenkowski in a stamp scheme.</p>
        <p>According to the indictment, Mr. Rostenkowski would sign and present a purchase order to Mr. Rota for a certain dollar amount of stamps for official mailings that were not covered by Congress' free-mailing privileges. Mr. Rostenkowski would later redeem those stamps for cash at the House post office, prosecutors said. On other occasions, the indictment said, Mr. Rota would simply give the cash first to Mr. Rostenkowski, who would later submit a purchase order made out as a stamp purchase.</p>
        <p>The charges seemed to illustrate how Mr. Rostenkowski had been caught in the ethical sea change that has swept over Congress in recent years. Office expense accounts, perquisites that were once considered nearly a fringe benefit of office, have come under attack by younger members elected by a public impatient with Congressional excess.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Holder, who has led the prosecution team since October 1993, rejected the idea that Mr. Rostenkowski was a victim of shifting standards. "This is not a petty matter," Mr. Holder said. "The cost of such misconduct must also be measured in terms of the corrosive effect it has on our democratic system of government and on the trust our citizens have in their elected officials."</p>
        <p>Today's charges followed a futile behind-the-scenes effort by Mr. Rostenkowski's lawyers to negotiate a plea agreement, an effort that collapsed late last week when the lawmaker balked at an arrangement that would have required him to spend six months in prison, pay a $38,000 fine and plead guilty to a crime.</p>
        <p>Early last week, his chief lawyer, Mr. Bennett -- who is representing Mr. Clinton in a civil suit accusing the President of sexual harassment while he was Governor of Arkansas -- reached a tentative deal with Mr. Holder that would have required Mr. Rostenkowski to plead guilty to misusing his office accounts but did not require him to admit wrongdoing in connection with the stamp purchases.</p>
        <p>"It was the deal of the century," said a person who had closely followed the negotiations. Friends' Advice</p>
        <p>Mr. Rostenkowski sounded out friends and colleagues, some of whom had urged him to fight on and to follow his combative instincts. But others warned that he faced a legal problem, not a political one, and would risk a long term in prison if convicted.</p>
        <p>The witness-tampering charge arises, prosecutors said, from Mr. Rostenkowski's asking an engraver, who also worked as a House employee, to inscribe brass plates used as support bases for crystal sculptures that the Congressman charged to his office account in the Capitol store in 1993. After the engraver received a subpoena to testify to the grand jury in September 1993, Mr. Rostenkowski, the indictment said, "instructed the engraver, over the telephone, that he should not say anything about the crystal sculptures."</p>
