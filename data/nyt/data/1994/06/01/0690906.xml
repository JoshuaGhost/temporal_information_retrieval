        <p>Padres 15, Pirates 5</p>
        <p>San Diego tied a team record by scoring 13 runs in the second inning as the Padres won their fifth straight game, 15-5, over the visiting Pittsburgh Pirates last night.</p>
        <p>The Padres set a club record by having the first 11 batters reach base in the inning, and matched a club mark for runs and hits in an inning set last Aug. 24 in the first inning against St. Louis.</p>
        <p>San Diego's outburst enabled Andy Benes (3-9) to break a personal four-game losing streak. Benes, who had lost 17 of his previous 21 decisions, allowed four runs and six hits in six and two-third innings. He walked 2 and struck out 10, raising his league-leading total to 83. Reds 5, Expos 4</p>
        <p>Reggie Sanders led off the bottom of the 13th inning with his second homer of the game, giving Cincinnati a victory over visiting Montreal. Sanders worked Jeff Shaw (2-2) to a full count, fouled off a breaking ball and then hit a belt-high fastball well beyond the wall in center field for his ninth homer. Pete Schourek (3-0) pitched out of a scoring threat in the 12th and retired the side in order in the 13th. Phillies 8, Cubs 7</p>
        <p>Jim Eisenreich's two-out, run-scoring single in the eighth inning lifted Philadelphia to victory over Chicago at Wrigley Field. Trailing, 7-5, in the eighth, the Phillies rallied for three runs against Jose Bautista and Randy Myers (0-2).  Braves 6, Giants 3</p>
        <p>Javier Lopez broke a ninth-inning tie with a leadoff home run as Atlanta rallied for the second straight day and beat host San Francisco. Matt Williams homered in the first inning, tying the National League record for homers in the first two months of the season at 19. The record was set in 1987 by Eric Davis of Cincinnati. Astros 5, Marlins 3</p>
        <p>Andujar Cedeno hit a two-run single to break an eighth-inning tie and sent Houston to the home victory. In the eighth, Luis Gonzalez and Chris Donnels hit two-out singles, and pinch-hitter Kevin Bass walked to load the bases. Cedeno followed with a single to left off Richie Lewis (1-3). Cardinals 6, Dodgers 0</p>
        <p>Rick Sutcliffe pitched a solid seven and two-thirds innings to send visiting St. Louis to victory over Los Angeles. Sutcliffe (2-1), gave seven hits, walked four and didn't record a strikeout in his fifth start with the Cardinals. Royals 9, Red Sox 7</p>
        <p>Mike Macfarlane made up for an error and getting thrown out at home by hitting a grand slam as Kansas City beat the Red Sox in Boston. Brian McRae had the first five-hit game of his career with four singles and an r.b.i. double in the ninth. He went 5 for 5 and scored once. Tigers 7, Orioles 6</p>
        <p>Cecil Fielder, Kirk Gibson and Junior Felix homered in a five-run fifth inning that lifted Detroit past slumping Baltimore at Camden Yards. Leo Gomez, Harold Baines and Mark McLemore homered for the Orioles, who have lost four of five. Mike Moore (5-4) allowed four runs and eight hits in five and a third innings, but still got his 150th career win. He is 150-155 in 13 seasons. Rangers 7, Brewers 4</p>
        <p>Oddibe McDowell drove in three runs and Roger Pavlik earned his first victory with seven solid innings as Texas beat host Milwaukee. McDowell and Rusty Greer each had two-run singles off Jaime Navarro (2-5) in the first inning for the Rangers, who won for the fourth time in five games. Twins 6, Mariners 2</p>
        <p>Scott Erickson made a successful return from the disabled list, limiting Seattle to four hits in six innings, as Minnesota won at home. Kirby Puckett drove in three runs with a bases-loaded single and a walk. The Twins sent Seattle to its sixth loss in eight games. Athletics 7, Blue Jays 2</p>
        <p>Ron Darling gave up two hits in seven and one-third innings and Troy Neel and Rickey Henderson drove in three runs apiece as Oakland won in Toronto. Darling (4-6) struck out eight and walked five as the A's won their fourth straight over the Blue Jays. AROUND THE MAJORS</p>
        <p>The Boston Red Sox, seeking to add right-handed power to one of the American League's weakest offenses, traded pitcher PAUL QUANTRILL and outfielder BILLY HATCHER to the Philadelphia Phillies for outfielder WES CHAMBERLAIN and minor league pitcher MIKE SULLIVAN last night.  BASEBALL</p>
