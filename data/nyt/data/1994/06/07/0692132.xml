        <p>After a four-day boycott, the Bosnian Government joined talks today on stopping the fighting in Bosnia, but there was little indication that differences with the Serbs over the length and nature of a cease-fire could be bridged.</p>
        <p>Ejup Ganic, vice president of the newly formed Muslim-Croatian federation in Bosnia, agreed to start talking after determining that no Serbian forces were left in the eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave of Gorazde. The presence of a handful of Serbs, in defiance of a six-week-old NATO ultimatum, had been the reason given by the Muslim-led Government for its boycott.</p>
        <p>But the Bosnian acquiescence to the talks was scarcely enthusiastic. In a proposal submitted to Yasushi Akashi, the top United Nations official in the Balkans, the Government suggested that a cease-fire be limited to four weeks.</p>
        <p>The document said this brief truce could be extended "if a substantial and serious improvement" was made in separate political negotiations on a territorial settlement in Bosnia. Bosnias Fear a Status Quo</p>
        <p>This stance underscored the main Bosnian preoccupation: that a cease-fire could consolidate the Serbs' current hold on 72 percent of Bosnia without offering any guarantee that the Serbs would soon surrender land to gain a political accord. A cease-fire that took hold in Croatia over two years ago has not led to any relaxation of the Serbs' hold on the 25 percent of that country's territory they occupied in 1991.</p>
        <p>For Bosnia, Mr. Akashi today proposed a renewable four-month cease-fire, the withdrawal of forces on either side of the front lines to a distance of a mile and a quarter, the removal by both sides of weapons with a caliber of over 12.7 millimeters beyond 12 1/2 miles from the line, and the positioning of United Nations troops between the warring armies.</p>
        <p>The Serbs, content with the territory they hold and anxious to secure the lifting of international trade sanctions on Serbia, have broadly backed this proposal. Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, said today that he generally accepted the draft and that "its weakest point is that it is limited to just four months."</p>
        <p>Michael Williams, a spokesman for Mr. Akashi, said that the view of the United Nations was that anything less than a four-month cease-fire would be ineffective and vulnerable.</p>
        <p>"Four months," he said, "would provide a lot of stability and a favorable context for a political settlement, while a shorter duration may fray at the edges more quickly." 'Very Long Way to Go'</p>
        <p>Asked if the difference between the Bosnian proposal of four weeks and the Serbian insistence on at least four months could be bridged, Mr. Williams said, "We have got a very long way to go."</p>
        <p>Mr. Akashi plans to submit a revised draft for a cessation of hostilities to both sides before talks resume on Tuesday. It was not clear how this would differ from his original proposal.</p>
        <p>A four-month cease-fire was requested last month by the United States, Russia and the European Union as an essential prelude to a political settlement.</p>
        <p>Diplomats from this so-called "contact group" have proposed a partition of Bosnia that would give 51 percent to the Muslim-Croatian federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.</p>
        <p>Both sides have rejected the proposal, and the Bosnian Government is anxious to see these political talks advance further before any long cease-fire is agreed.</p>
        <p>Another problem with any cease-fire is that the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia, Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Rose, estimates that a further 5,500 United Nations troops would be needed in Bosnia to patrol the 750-mile front line between the armies.</p>
