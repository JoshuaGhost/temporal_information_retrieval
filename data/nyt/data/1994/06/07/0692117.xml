        <p>A MYSTERIOUS ailment has been devastating the much studied lions of the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and scientists said yesterday that it had been identified as canine distemper, a viral disease that causes severe neurological symptoms and death.</p>
        <p>Prides of lions in the Serengeti, whose behavior has been the subject of intensive study for almost 30 years, have been decimated by the disease outbreak since it was first noticed at the beginning of the year, said researchers monitoring the animals.</p>
        <p>"Of the 250 or so study animals we've been following, perhaps a third have been wiped out by what we've just found out to be distemper, and many more are sick," Dr. Craig Packer of the University of Minnesota said in an interview. Dr. Packer and Dr. Anne Pusey, a fellow zoologist, have directed the lion project since 1978.</p>
        <p>Since early February, researchers and two graduate student assistants, Sarah Legge and Pamela Bell, have found bodies of lions and directly observed the deaths of seven animals that appeared to suffer neurological seizures. The dying lions were unable to stand because of severe convulsions and one animal repeatedly turned in tight circles, they said.</p>
        <p>They said other lions showed signs of persistent twitches and facial contortions while some jerked and flailed their paws when they relaxed. Damage in Brain Cells</p>
        <p>Veterinarians led by Dr. Melody Roelke of the Tanzania National Park Service collected blood and tissue samples from 60 lions and sent them for study to several universities in Tanzania, Switzerland and the United States. Preliminary studies found evidence of cell death and damage in two brain tissue samples, and early analysis ruled out rabies and feline leukemia virus as possible causes, researchers said.</p>
        <p>These studies also at first ruled out distemper, Dr. Packer said, but a detailed analysis by Dr. Linda Munson of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville found evidence of viral distemper. Samples were then sent to Dr. Max Appel at Cornell University, an expert on distemper, who last week confirmed evidence of the virus with a special assay.</p>
        <p>Dr. Munson, a veterinary pathologist, said that when the virus reproduced in certain cells, it made proteins that could take on a distinctive spiral shape, which she found in tissue samples from the dead lions.  There have been several recent outbreaks of canine distemper among big cats, she said, and Dr. Appel plans to examine the virus found in the lions closely to see if it is a new mutant strain that makes large cats particularly vulnerable. Plan to Vaccinate Dogs</p>
        <p>Researchers suspect that the lions may have contracted distemper from the many dogs kept by local tribesmen. One approach to controlling the disease among lions might be to vaccinate dogs against it as part of a new campaign to inoculate them against rabies, Dr. Packer said.</p>
        <p>Canine distemper got its name because it is a common viral ailment in dogs, wolves and foxes. But the virus has turned out to have a large species range, and can also inflict big cats like lions, tigers and leopards, as well as raccoons, skunks and other animals. The disease, which is distinct from feline distemper virus that affects small domestic cats, almost wiped out the endangered black-footed ferret in Wyoming a decade ago.  Symptoms include thick nasal discharge, watering eyes, inflammation of the lungs and other organs, and damage to the nervous system displayed as twitching and walking in circles.</p>
        <p>The most effective distemper vaccines use weakened live viruses to initiate protective immune responses, but because these vaccines carry a small risk of actually causing the disease, he said, they cannot be used on wild animals.</p>
