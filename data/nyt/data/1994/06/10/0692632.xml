        <p>Think of three sailors on the town during World War II, and you will think "Fancy Free," the very first ballet created by Jerome Robbins and Leonard Bernstein. Nothing better illustrates the difference between a cliche and a classic in art than this evergreen masterpiece, especially as it is being performed on its 50th anniversary this season by the New York City Ballet.</p>
        <p>Although the actual premiere in 1944 took place with Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater), "Fancy Free" has gradually found its proper niche in the City Ballet. In 1979, Mr. Robbins transferred the work from his first company to the troupe where he has done most of his creative work and where his esthetics have been very different.</p>

        <p>Think of three sailors on the town during World War II, and you will think "Fancy Free," the very first ballet created by Jerome Robbins and Leonard Bernstein. Nothing better illustrates the difference between a cliche and a classic in art than this evergreen masterpiece, especially as it is being performed on its 50th anniversary this season by the New York City Ballet.</p>
        <p>Although the actual premiere in 1944 took place with Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater), "Fancy Free" has gradually found its proper niche in the City Ballet. In 1979, Mr. Robbins transferred the work from his first company to the troupe where he has done most of his creative work and where his esthetics have been very different.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Robbins never did create another ballet like "Fancy Free," and the sharp change in direction he made immediately afterward was visible even on Wednesday night at the New York State Theater. The program, which included repeats of George Balanchine's "Kammermusik No. 2" and Peter Martins's "Valse Triste," juxtaposed "Fancy Free" with "Interplay," which Mr. Robbins created in 1945.</p>
        <p>In this second ballet, he is already more abstract, abandoning the narrative vignette at the heart of "Fancy Free" and more open about the classical technique that is essential to "Fancy Free" but often hidden under a vernacular veneer.</p>
        <p>If "Fancy Free" has a literary pretext, the reason may be that Mr. Robbins's starting point was the written scenario he was obliged to submit to Ballet Theater as an aspiring choreographer. The management had previously rejected his visions of a full-evening epic. Mary Hunter, an associate of Agnes de Mille, suggested another springboard: "The Fleet Is In," Paul Cadmus's typically erotic painting of sailors having a good time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robbins opted for a more innocent view, still possible in wartime America; his three sailors in Times Square are good boys visibly keeping adolescent hormones under control. Their encounters are with what used to be called nice girls. Atmosphere is what "Fancy Free" is really about. Bernstein's wonderful score incorporates the jazz and Latin dance rhythms of a still recognizable urban past. Oliver Smith's superb set evokes a mythical New York rooted in reality, with its Hopper-like bar set against a backdrop of skyscrapers.</p>
        <p>The current cast of sailors looking for action is among the best. Robert LaFosse, Tom Gold and Damian Woetzel keep up the essential spirit of camaraderie. All are wide-eyed at first, but the distinctions between them are quickly conveyed, so brilliantly is characterization built into the movement.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaFosse's ballroom duet with Melinda Roy, whose leggy dancing suggests more of a tease than usual, is full of make-believe sophistication. That posture is poignantly torn away in the solo through which Mr. LaFosse so effectively reveals the sweetness underneath.</p>
        <p>In contrast to this lyricism with masculine grace, Mr. Gold and Mr. Woetzel are all brashness. Bravado is bravura in Mr. Gold's case, with his fantastic double air-turns ending in a split, while Mr. Woetzel's extraordinarily springy rumba is full of sinuous wit. William Otto's bartender is nicely deadpan. Sherri LeBlanc is pert as the first woman, and Aura Dixon makes her cameo fresh through some amusing self-awareness.</p>
