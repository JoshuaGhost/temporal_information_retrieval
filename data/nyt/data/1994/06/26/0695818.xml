        <p>THE ECONOMY Suddenly, All Eyes Are on the Dollar (Just Look Down)  Currency traders took the markets on a wild ride last week, with the dollar crossing the 100-yen barrier for the first time in the postwar era. And central banks, it seems, can do little. By Friday, the White House decided to intervene and got 16 central banks to join it in a $5-billion shopping trip for dollars, but traders didn't even blink, as the dollar hit a '94 low of 1.58 marks. The next step, of course, could well be for the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws again in early July, and this prospect didn't make the stock market happy at all, as the Dow industrials plunged 62 points on Friday, ending a dismal week in which it lost 140 points, or close to 4 percent. President Clinton couldn't figure out why all this was happening, saying the dollar's fall was "puzzling a lot of economists." He insisted, probably correctly, that the American economy "is performing so well." But for today's hair-trigger markets, nothing is ever remotely that simple.</p>

        <p>Health Care: Limping Onward  Health care legislation has become like an ambulance crossing a war zone. Snipers abound, two tires are flat, the windshield's smashed, but if it can just get through, maybe all can be patched up. In last week's skirmishes, the Senate Finance Committee, trying to break a deadlock, flirted with the idea of making individuals, not employers, buy coverage. This drew quick fire from a coalition of labor and consumer groups, who said middle-income people would get the short end. But Senator Thomas Daschle cut right to the chase when he said, "It keeps the process going." And the Clintons, still vowing universal coverage, floated above the fray, hoping that in the end their vision would be fulfilled. John Sculley, Part-Timer  This is the 90's. Good jobs vanish, yesterday's hotshot drives a cab, many settle for part-time work. And it's not just the other guy any more. Last week none other than John Sculley, once king of the technology hill, fell into step by taking a part-time job at Kodak. The former Apple Computer chairman took a humiliating detour recently by heading Spectrum Information Technologies, then beating a hasty retreat, pleading ignorance, when all sorts of messy questions popped up about the company. Now he'll spend about a quarter of his time helping Kodak, in the midst of a back-to-basics blitz, build up its digital imaging business. One wonders if, unlike most part-timers, he gets health benefits. Bennington's Reality Seminar  When a baby-boom parent has a dark-of-night panic attack, chances are it's brought on by that monster looming too-few years away: college tuition. But small colleges have nightmares, too: not enough baby-bust kids to pay those fancy tuitions. And if the school's tucked off in a bucolic corner, it can't lure the older student who's dipping back into the books. Take Bennington. At $25,800, its annual cost is among the highest, but its enrollment is down. Something had to give, and last week it did. In a drastic effort to close a $1 million deficit, it's cutting tuition, reducing faculty and scrapping tenure. If this spreads, the tuition sticker could soon be less of a shock. Trial by Jeans  To pitch No Excuses jeans, you've got to hit just the right level of naughtiness -- not too much or too little -- and, of course, be famous. Donna Rice, yes. Marla Maples, definitely. Tonya Harding? Sorry. Last week Paula Jones joined this galaxy, accepting $50,000 for showing up at a press conference sporting No Excuses jeans and T-shirt. The check will help with her legal bills, and half goes to a center for abused women. Will her new image help in her case against President Clinton? Who knows. Mrs. Jones said she was unaware of prior No Excuses ads, saying only, "I knew the company favors women's rights." INTERNATIONAL Japan's Economy, on the Mend?  For the moment, at least, Japan's economy seems to have shaken off its slump. Last week came a report that G.D.P. grew at a surprisingly strong 3.9 percent rate in the first quarter, and a real bright spot was a hefty rise in consumer spending. Japan, it seems, is learning about discounting, and customers are taking to it just as Americans have. But while one official assessment was that "the worst period is over," caution is still the word. The economy is often strong in the first quarter, only to fall later, and the strong yen could make it awfully hard to sell exports.  Wiring the Global Village  This "global village" stuff is getting serious. Why, they're even playing soccer in the United States, land of the sacred football. The phone giants badly want to be in the thick of it when this village's corporate citizens want to communicate with one another: MCI just got the go-ahead for a link with British Telecom, and Sprint made a deal with the French and German phone companies. AT&amp;T has been trying to get in the act, too, and last week it teamed up with phone companies in Switzerland, Sweden and the Netherlands. AT&amp;T's deal is more humble than those of its rivals, though, so it's still searching for more.  A Drop of Microsoft Blood  Microsoft is mortal after all: a small company called Stac Electronics has actually drawn blood. A Federal judge recently ordered Microsoft to recall two versions of its MS-DOS software that a jury had found to infringe Stac patents -- an order that could have wreaked havoc on sales. But last week Microsoft descended from it mountain and settled with Stac, agreeing to pay $1 million a month in royalties and invest nearly $40 million in Stac. That's a minor bruise for Microsoft -- and, who knows, that investment may even wind up being a good one. But the deal certainly emboldens its once-quaking rivals. Lotus Takes Its Lumps  One of Microsoft's rivals, though, had big troubles of its own last week. Late on Monday, Lotus made a surprise announcement that its quarterly earnings would fall short of expectations, and the next day Lotus shares plunged 28 percent. They slipped even more by the week's end, to close at $34.25, a far cry from their lofty $86.50 just three months ago. The culprit, Lotus said: its Windows desktop software was suffering in its competition with Microsoft products. Why? Because in this industry of day-old antiques, Lotus's package, now more than a year old, is from the dark ages, while Microsoft put out a fresh version this year. Again, Caterpillar vs. the U.A.W.  Caterpillar and the U.A.W. just can't seem to work things out. In the last 16 labor contracts, there have been 14 strikes, with the latest one coming last week at about a dozen plants. As the bitterness mounted, Caterpillar tried to get its assembly lines moving by using supervisors and other white-collar workers, which prompted one striker to recall, "The last time they tried this, the foremen wrecked some of the machinery." Philip Morris, Undaunted  The tobacco industry is circling its wagons. There had been talk at Philip Morris of splitting tobacco from other businesses, but the board recently shelved that idea. And last weekend its chairman, Michael Miles, a nonsmoker who'd headed Kraft when Philip Morris bought it, resigned unexpectedly -- apparently because he'd backed that split. And his successors hit the ground smoking, with Geoffrey Bible, the new chief executive, vowing to "defend our industry and the rights of our consumers as briskly as we possibly can."  Tastes Great, Not Addictive  The tobacco industry also came under attack last week as David Kessler, the F.D.A. commissioner, testified before a House panel that Brown &amp; Williamson had manipulated its cigarettes' addictive nature by using a high-nicotine tobacco. But Thomas Sandefur, Brown &amp; Williamson's chairman, was not about to let that pass. In his own testimony, he called Dr. Kessler's charges "a crusade for the sake of a political agenda" and "grandstanding." He conceded the existence of the high-nicotine tobacco, but insisted that the goal was better taste, not greater addiction. And nicotine, he repeated, is not addictive anyway. Now, G.M. as Mother-in-Law  Most people wouldn't equate buying a car with joining a "family." But they wouldn't be reckoning on that odd car called the Saturn. Well, not odd car, exactly -- it's much like other cars -- but the ads make buying one seem like bonding, like joining a cult. Saturn took the cultishness to an odd extreme last week, inviting Saturn owners to a "family get-together" at its factory in Spring Hill, Tenn. And, in clear proof that people love to belong, no matter the cause, thousands planned to make the trek. One hopes that afterward, in a sea of Saturns, they all found their cars.  A Kidder Head Had to Roll  It was nothing personal, really. Michael Carpenter is a friend of his. But John Welch, G.E.'s chairman, said last week that he had to replace Mr. Carpenter as Kidder, Peabody's chief executive because, well, securities are different from refrigerators. When other people's money is involved, there must be total confidence about a firm's future. After the Joseph Jett scandal, that confidence was less than total. "Though they have no basis in reality," Mr. Welch said, perceptions "can become reality." So a corner-office head had to roll, with two G.E. executives taking the reins for now.</p>
