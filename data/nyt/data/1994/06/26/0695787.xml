        <p>The undeveloped plot of land on Manhattan's Upper West Side that is known as Riverside South has become a canvas of sorts for a literal landscape by the environmental artist Stan Herd.</p>
        <p>The plotting and planting of the earthwork, "Countryside," began last month, but the one-square-acre project did not become visible until earlier this month; it will continue to evolve over the summer. Mr. Herd is using a variety of planted crops, like squash, along with flowers, grasses, clover, groundcover, paving stones, and natural materials, like topsoil, to create an undulating image of trees and clouds.</p>

        <p>The undeveloped plot of land on Manhattan's Upper West Side that is known as Riverside South has become a canvas of sorts for a literal landscape by the environmental artist Stan Herd.</p>
        <p>The plotting and planting of the earthwork, "Countryside," began last month, but the one-square-acre project did not become visible until earlier this month; it will continue to evolve over the summer. Mr. Herd is using a variety of planted crops, like squash, along with flowers, grasses, clover, groundcover, paving stones, and natural materials, like topsoil, to create an undulating image of trees and clouds.</p>
        <p>The son of a Kansas farmer, Mr. Herd began using large plots of land for artworks in 1980 and has created images of Will Rogers, a vodka bottle and still-lifes that can be seen from passengers in aircraft flying overhead. "This is the smallest image I have ever attempted," he said. "It's also the first one that will be visible to passers-by on an overlook, and to the people in Lincoln Towers who face New Jersey."</p>
        <p>"Countryside" will run along the Hudson River from 68th to 70th Streets along the old Penn Central railyards. The area is part of the 74.6-acre Riverside South, a planned multibillion-dollar housing and commercial project that is being developed by the Trump Organization, which owns the property, and six civic, community and environmental groups. Mr. Herd approached the Trump Organization last fall about licensing the land rent free; supporting landscaping services and supplies are being donated.</p>
        <p>"It may seem presumptuous to lay down a piece of art so large that it's hard to ignore," Mr. Herd said. "But I presume most people will enjoy it, and if they don't, well it won't last forever."</p>
        <p>Mr. Herd's license expires Nov. 1, but the art might be left dormant in the winter -- when a snowfall will create a subtle bas relief effect. "And who knows?" he said. "Maybe we'll replant in the spring."</p>
