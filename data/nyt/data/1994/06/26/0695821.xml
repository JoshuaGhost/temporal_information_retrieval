        <p>The long effort to build a police academy in the South Bronx reached a milestone last week when Mayor Giuliani, under pressure from Bronx officials and black and Hispanic Council members from around the city, restored money to pay for the initial stages of the project. But the academy's future still hangs in abeyance.</p>
        <p>The new budget approved by the City Council early Thursday morning included only $11 million for design work on the new eight-story academy at 153d Street and Park Avenue, but no one at this point can say when the city will be able to come up with the $138 million to build the project.</p>
        <p>Restoring the design money was the focus of a hard-fought battle between elected officials in support of the project and the Giuliani administration, which announced in February that the academy had been cut from the budget to close a $2.3 billion gap.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Dinkins administration delayed the project because of concerns about its costs. The move came several years after the Koch administration announced in early 1989 that the academy would anchor an ambitious plan to rebuild the South Bronx.</p>
        <p>So after years of delays, Bronx elected officials and their constituents, mostly blacks and Hispanics, began pressuring the Giuliani administration to restore the money. The fight was led by Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer and Councilwoman June M. Eisland, who garnered the support of Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone and the Council's black and Hispanic caucus.</p>
        <p>In spite of questions about when the construction will actually occur, proponents of the academy celebrated a victory, saying they are certain construction dollars will appear after the design is complete.</p>
        <p>"Everybody thought the push to restore the police academy was a fool's errand, that it had no chance to survive a mayoral budget cut, but the City Council stood tall," Mr. Ferrer said. "This has been a tough budget year with much pain and many cutbacks, but the police academy was a project this city couldn't afford to lose."</p>
        <p>Forrest R. Taylor, a deputy press secretary for Mr. Giuliani, said the Mayor decided to restore the design money for the project because the officials made a case for it.</p>
        <p>"He needed the additional information to determine whether this was a good project for the city, and they were able to do that," Mr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>But he said that Mayor Giuliani would not commit to full construction funding until he saw the design. It is unclear how long it will take to complete the design.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrer referred to the academy as a shot in the arm for the borough's redevelopment plans.</p>
        <p>The police academy is the key public-works project in the Bronx Center Plan, a comprehensive 300-block revitalization effort in the South Bronx. It includes land around Yankee Stadium, the 1,500- to 1,700-unit Melrose Commons housing project, the one-million-square-foot State Supreme Court super-block on East 161 Street and the Bronx Housing Court on 165th Street and the Grand Concourse.</p>
        <p>Parts of the plan are under way. Although no major funding is committed yet, the Melrose Commons project began its public-review process about a month ago.</p>
        <p>"I would like to assume that we are going to end up building the academy," said Richard Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly, an non-profit urban affairs group, and chairman of the Bronx Center Plan. "It's one of the most important projects in the South Bronx right now, and we're going to try to see that it happens." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: SOUTH BRONX</p>
