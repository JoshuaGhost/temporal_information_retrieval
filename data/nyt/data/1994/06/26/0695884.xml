        <p>I have served as the entertainment and celebrity coordinator for Sunday by the Bay for three years and was elected to the board of Stopping AIDS Together in January 1994. I can thus state unequivocally that the article is unnecessarily sensationalist and extremely misleading.</p>
        <p>Stopping AIDS Together has not "split." In its highly successful four-year history -- and for four years prior as P.T.A.A.A. -- Stopping AIDS Together has always had a coming and going of active members. There was a minor reorganization of the group this year, including the election of new board members and the creation of an executive committee, which has 19 members, not three, as stated in the article.</p>
        <p>Second, while there is no question that Ingo Thouret was an integral part of the event during his tenure, to claim that "Ingo honestly is the benefit" is absurd. No one person is or ever has been "the benefit," -- not even Stopping AIDS Together founder and president Deanna Annis, for whom such a claim might more readily be made. Sunday by the Bay has always been a team effort, with a core group of about 30, plus well over 100 volunteers. And Clare Connaughton's statement -- "It really pains me not to be involved" -- is specious at best. She never attended a meeting of Stopping AIDS Together.</p>

        <p>I have served as the entertainment and celebrity coordinator for Sunday by the Bay for three years and was elected to the board of Stopping AIDS Together in January 1994. I can thus state unequivocally that the article is unnecessarily sensationalist and extremely misleading.</p>
        <p>Stopping AIDS Together has not "split." In its highly successful four-year history -- and for four years prior as P.T.A.A.A. -- Stopping AIDS Together has always had a coming and going of active members. There was a minor reorganization of the group this year, including the election of new board members and the creation of an executive committee, which has 19 members, not three, as stated in the article.</p>
        <p>Second, while there is no question that Ingo Thouret was an integral part of the event during his tenure, to claim that "Ingo honestly is the benefit" is absurd. No one person is or ever has been "the benefit," -- not even Stopping AIDS Together founder and president Deanna Annis, for whom such a claim might more readily be made. Sunday by the Bay has always been a team effort, with a core group of about 30, plus well over 100 volunteers. And Clare Connaughton's statement -- "It really pains me not to be involved" -- is specious at best. She never attended a meeting of Stopping AIDS Together.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to the salary issue, which is really a nonissue. In fact, the entire salary question looks quite different when you consider that Mr. Thouret was the first person to demand that he be paid for his work on the event, a demand which was so important to him that he resigned from the board in order to have it met.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thouret earned $15,000 for approximately five months' work, plus about $5,000 for expenses. Ms. Annis's $25,000 annual salary -- voted before I became a member of the board -- comes into even clearer perspective when you consider that she gave up her business to run the event; that she spent thousands of dollars of her own money producing the event in past years, little of which was ever reimbursed; that she is recently divorced and has thus lost whatever additional income she may have had, and that producing the event is a full-time occupation for her. Indeed, an annual salary of $25,000 is low for a good secretary, much less the founder and president of a major AIDS organization.</p>
        <p>Finally, while it is true that Ms. Annis is being forced to sell the estate which has served as the venue for Sunday by the Bay for the past seven years, Stopping AIDS Together expects to continue to hold an annual AIDS fund-raising event each year. And although future events will almost certainly take on a different form, they will be no less fabulous, fun and successful than Sunday by the Bay has been since 1987.</p>
        <p>P.T.A.A.A. and Stopping AIDS Together have raised approximately $2 million in seven years, almost 75 percent of which has been distributed to AIDS groups throughout Long Island and New York City. This ratio of dollars taken in to dollars distributed makes us one of the most efficient AIDS organizations in the entire country. Among our many important successes was our helping to underwrite the original Community Research Initiative study that led to the development of aerosolized pentamidine, which is now the leading AIDS-related antipneumonia drug in the world.</p>
        <p>And the personal and financial integrity of Ms. Annis, the board of Stopping AIDS Together and the event itself are not only as good or better than most nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations, they have been and continue to be completely above reproach. IAN ALTERMAN New York City</p>
