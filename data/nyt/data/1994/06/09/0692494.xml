        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a teacher with 30 years' experience teaching science and math from first grade to senior year, I generally agree with Lou Gerstner's estimate of where American education is failing its students (Op-Ed, May 27).</p>
        <p>However, he does not mention one of our most glaring faults, and that is our inability to engage the minds of our students with discourse and logic. No amount of hands-on exploration can substitute for the minds-on conceptual stimulation and logical analysis that serve as the foundation for truly successful college work.</p>
        <p>Large doses of hands-on activities are necessary for the very youngest children whose cognitive development is only beginning, and for those on a vocational track who will become the future factory workers of America. Successful workers in the Information Age, however, will need to be equipped with logical and conceptual skills that are best developed through intensive thinking, writing and argumentation.</p>
        <p>My guess is Socrates and Einstein will prove better models for educational change in the competitive world market than Henry Ford or Thomas Edison.  JOHN E. HELBOK  Bronx, May 30, 1994 The writer teaches science at the Horace Mann School.</p>
