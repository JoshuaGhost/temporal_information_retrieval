        <p>Unless an agreement is reached soon, the All-Pro cornerback DEION SANDERS will not play for the Atlanta Falcons next season, the team said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Falcons are offering Sanders, who also plays major league baseball, a one-year contract for $2.88 million, prorated by the number of games he plays. Sanders is demanding a three-year contract, said his agent, EUGENE PARKER.</p>
        <p>"It's to the point now where we need a commitment," said the Falcons' vice president of player personnel, KEN HEROCK, who has spent the past week devising a formula that would fit Sanders's salary under the team's $34.6 million cap.</p>
        <p>If Sanders rejects its latest offer, Atlanta is expected to sign the former Cleveland linebacker CLAY MATTHEWS, an unrestricted free agent. Falcon Coach JUNE JONES said the team could not afford to sign both veterans. The Falcons also could wind up losing Matthews, who has also had discussions with the Los Angeles Raiders, if the talks drag on. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: PRO FOOTBALL</p>
