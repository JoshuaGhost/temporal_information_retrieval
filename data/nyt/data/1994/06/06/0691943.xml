        <p>The Seagram Company has ended an agency relationship of 32 years by dismissing DDB Needham Worldwide in New York as one of its global agencies, handling accounts with billings estimated at $41 million. The dismissal came as Seagram placed all its brands at the agency, like Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, in review and excluded DDB Needham from that review.</p>
        <p>"DDB Needham helped Seagram to grow those brands over the years," Chris Tofalli, a Seagram spokesman in New York, said Friday, "but we feel it's an appropriate time to begin a review on a global basis." Besides the Chivas brand, the review involves two other global accounts, Crown Royal whisky and Cordon Rouge de Mumm Champagne, and two Seagram accounts in this country, Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum and Myers's rum.</p>

        <p>The Seagram Company has ended an agency relationship of 32 years by dismissing DDB Needham Worldwide in New York as one of its global agencies, handling accounts with billings estimated at $41 million. The dismissal came as Seagram placed all its brands at the agency, like Chivas Regal Scotch whisky, in review and excluded DDB Needham from that review.</p>
        <p>"DDB Needham helped Seagram to grow those brands over the years," Chris Tofalli, a Seagram spokesman in New York, said Friday, "but we feel it's an appropriate time to begin a review on a global basis." Besides the Chivas brand, the review involves two other global accounts, Crown Royal whisky and Cordon Rouge de Mumm Champagne, and two Seagram accounts in this country, Captain Morgan Original Spiced Rum and Myers's rum.</p>
        <p>Lou Tripodi, a DDB Needham spokesman in New York, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Tofalli declined to elaborate on the details of the review, agencies most likely to be among the participants are the three other Seagram shops: Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, which was recently awarded the Martell Cognac brand from DDB Needham; TBWA Advertising in New York, which already handles brands like Absolut vodka and which expanded its relationship with Seagram last week by picking up the Glenlivet single malt Scotch whisky brand, and Wells Rich Greene BDDP in New York, which handles brands marketed by the Seagram Beverage Company unit.</p>
        <p>The Seagram and DDB Needham relationship dates to 1962, when Seagram hired a predecessor agency, Doyle Dane Bernbach. Trade publications have speculated that the bond with DDB Needham had been weakening because of a recent reassignment for John Bernbach, the agency's vice chairman, whose father, William, was instrumental in creating campaigns for Chivas that are considered among the best ever in advertising.
