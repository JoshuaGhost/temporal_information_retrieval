        <p>If there were lingering doubts about how interconnected the world's financial markets have become and how powerful an effect they can have on the world's economies, this week's turmoil should have laid them to rest.</p>
        <p>The turmoil encompassed a weakening dollar and plunging stock and bond prices. It washed indiscriminately over the major exchanges in Tokyo, London, Frankfurt and New York, seemingly oblivious to very real differences in national economic conditions.</p>
        <p>At work are factors as diverse as rising commodity prices, which economists and investors around the world see as a precursor to inflation, and political instability in Japan, which is an impediment to progress in reducing that nation's trade surplus with the United States.</p>
        <p>In Frankfurt, meanwhile, the selloff in the bond market has driven up long-term interest rates, perhaps endangering Germany's chances of pulling itself out of recession. International Cooperation Needed</p>
        <p>The global nature of the problems has put a premium on international cooperation, economists said. The situation is certain to be at the top of the agenda at the meeting of leaders from the world's seven largest industrial democracies starting on July 7 in Naples.</p>
        <p>But it remains unclear what action the Group of Seven nations might take, aside from jawboning -- urging the United States, which has made progress in bringing down its budget deficit, to cut it further and faster, or pressing Japan to buy more imports -- or endorsing more concerted intervention to prop up the dollar.</p>
        <p>"In terms of the bond markets, there's not very much they can do about it except to stress that inflation fears are overdone," said Tapan Datta, a senior economist at the American Express Bank in London. "One of the things they can do is support the dollar. We haven't seen a sustained generalized intervention yet." Bears on the Bourses</p>
        <p>In London today, stocks fell to their lowest level this year; the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares plunged 65.8 points to close at 2,876.6. Shares also tumbled in Frankfurt, Paris and Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Bond prices dropped in all the major markets, sending yields up substantially, although the selloff was tempered late in the day when central banks, seeking to stop the dollar's fall, bought the American currency.</p>
        <p>The bottom line was bad news for just about everyone. The dollar's weakening has increased the chances that American interest rates will have to rise faster than they would otherwise, to minimize the risk that rising import prices will fuel inflation. The falling dollar has imperiled Japan's fragile economic recovery by making Japanese exports more expensive relative to American goods.</p>
        <p>Falling bond prices mean higher long-term rates, and higher rates could choke off economic recovery in Germany and the rest of Europe. German Rates Rise</p>
        <p>The yield on Germany's 10-year Government bonds has risen from 5.5 percent earlier this year to about 7.10 percent now. The increase in long-term yields has been even more pronounced elsewhere in Europe. Economists in Britain said rising long-term rates were already putting a crimp in what had been shaping up as a recovery in the housing market.</p>
        <p>For investors and analysts outside the United States, the key question is whether the Clinton Administration is really dedicated to strengthening the dollar, thereby calming global financial markets, or whether it would like to keep the dollar weak to wring more trade concessions from Japan.</p>
        <p>"The underlying economics of the dollar are quite good, but they're completely overrun by the political situation, which is interpreted in a very negative fashion in the markets," said Steve Barrow, an economist at Chemical Bank in London.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrow said currency traders were not yet convinced that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen was willing to support the dollar aggressively -- meaning Europe is likely to face falling stock and bond prices and growing questions about its ability to drag itself out of recession.</p>
        <p>"The situation doesn't just ripple, it bangs into the European markets," Mr. Barrow said. "We're in a situation now where it's in everybody's interests to have a stronger dollar. Either the G-7 nations don't see it that way, or they do see it that way but can't get themselves together to do something on the dollar. I don't think they see the seriousness of the situation."
