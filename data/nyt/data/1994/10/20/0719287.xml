        <p>Johnson &amp; Johnson reported an increase of 15.6 percent in its profits for the third quarter, as worldwide sales rose and costs were reduced.</p>
        <p>"It was a blowout quarter," said Samuel Isaly of Mehta &amp; Isaly Worldwide Drug Research.</p>
        <p>Ralph S. Larsen, chairman and chief executive of Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the performance was solid in all three divisions: consumer products, prescription drugs and hospital supplies.</p>
        <p>"The great shock was how fast they are growing in the pharmaceutical business," Mr. Isaly said.</p>
        <p>Worldwide pharmaceutical sales rose 21.2 percent in the quarter, reflecting big gains in domestic sales of new products like Risperdal for schizophrenia and Propulsid for gastrointestinal problems. In only six months on the market, Risperdal sales exceeded $100 million, the company said.</p>
        <p>That growth far outpaced the worldwide pharmaceutical industry, which was growing at only 3.5 percent, Mr. Isaly said.</p>
        <p>Overall worldwide sales increased 15.2 percent, helped by favorable currency rates. Sales rose 22.1 percent overseas, spurred by strong growth in emerging markets, and 8.9 percent in the United States.</p>
        <p>On the cost-cutting front, Mr. Larsen said the company, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J., had reduced sales, marketing and administrative spending as a percent of sales to 39.6 percent, a drop of 1.6 points from a year earlier.</p>
