        <p>The White House said yesterday that President Clinton would go ahead with plans to visit Israel and Jordan next week despite the deadly terrorist bombing in Tel Aviv, which Mr. Clinton called "an outrage against the conscience of the world."</p>
        <p>In a written statement, Mr. Clinton called on leaders around the world to condemn the attack, which came just two days after he announced that he would travel to the region to join Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and King Hussein of Jordan as they sign a peace treaty. Later, in a speech in New York, Mr. Clinton denounced the attack as one that aimed "to wreck the quest of the Arabs and Israelis for peace in the Middle East." He labeled those responsible as terrorists and declared, "They must not be allowed to succeed."</p>

        <p>In a written statement, Mr. Clinton called on leaders around the world to condemn the attack, which came just two days after he announced that he would travel to the region to join Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and King Hussein of Jordan as they sign a peace treaty. Later, in a speech in New York, Mr. Clinton denounced the attack as one that aimed "to wreck the quest of the Arabs and Israelis for peace in the Middle East." He labeled those responsible as terrorists and declared, "They must not be allowed to succeed."</p>
        <p>In traveling to the region, Mr. Clinton will become the first American President to visit Israel since Jimmy Carter went there in 1979, and the White House was drafting extensive plans yesterday for his four-day journey.</p>
        <p>After witnessing the signing of the accord next Wednesday on the Israel-Jordan border, Mr. Clinton is likely to fly on to Amman, Jordan, where he will spend the night and address the Jordanian Parliament, White House officials said yesterday. He will return to Israel on Thursday to visit Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, where he will address the Israeli Parliament, and then fly on to Kuwait on Friday to visit the American soldiers and marines he dispatched there this month to deter an Iraqi invasion.</p>
        <p>White House officials traveling with the President in New York yesterday said that Mr. Clinton remained determined to compress his journey into about 72 hours so that he could return to the United States and a heavy schedule of campaigning for Democratic candidates in the Nov. 8 elections.
