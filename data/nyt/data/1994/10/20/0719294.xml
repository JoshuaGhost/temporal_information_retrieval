        <p>The book that is causing all the fuss in Judge Lance A. Ito's courtroom sold about 10,000 copies yesterday alone, according to its publisher, Dove Books.</p>
        <p>Michael Viner, the president of Dove Audio and Dove Books, said in an interview from his office in Los Angeles that Dove had printed 600,000 copies of the book, "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted" by Kaye D. Resnick.</p>
        <p>That is an extraordinarily large number, particularly at a time when a number of other big-selling books are in stores.</p>
        <p>But David Nelson, vice president and director of sales for adult hardcovers at Penguin, which is distributing the Resnick book, said that early sales had been very promising, with some stores reporting that they had sold out their stock since the book began arriving on Monday.</p>
        <p>"Judge Ito's stopping the trial and putting a ban on the book for the jurors really helped the book out," Mr. Nelson said. "When you tell people they shouldn't read something, it encourages them to do it."</p>
        <p>But an employee at the Barnes and Noble store at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan said that while the book was selling well, it was not doing any better than several other books out now. "They're asking for this book, they're asking for the Pope book," the employee said.</p>
        <p>"And they're also asking for the new biography of Michael Jackson that's coming out soon."</p>
