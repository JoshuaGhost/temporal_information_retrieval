        <p>PRIMO NEBIOLO, president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, has announced plans for revitalizing the sport of track and field in the United States.</p>
        <p>"We hope to embark on a serious support program for track and field in the United States so that U.S. athletes can receive the publicity and recognition they deserve," Nebiolo said yesterday in Mar Del Plata, Argentina, where he is attending the Ibero-American championships. "A more healthy, visible status for U.S. athletics will certainly help the overall publicity of our sport internationally."</p>

        <p>PRIMO NEBIOLO, president of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, has announced plans for revitalizing the sport of track and field in the United States.</p>
        <p>"We hope to embark on a serious support program for track and field in the United States so that U.S. athletes can receive the publicity and recognition they deserve," Nebiolo said yesterday in Mar Del Plata, Argentina, where he is attending the Ibero-American championships. "A more healthy, visible status for U.S. athletics will certainly help the overall publicity of our sport internationally."</p>
        <p>Track and field has suffered from a lack of popularity in the United States, home of many of the world's top athletes. Many top American athletes get more recognition in Europe than they do in the United States. Nebiolo suggested that revenues accrued from track and field at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta could be funneled into the United States program. He said plans would be discussed with USA Track and Field and the United States Olympic Committee. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: TRACK AND FIELD</p>
