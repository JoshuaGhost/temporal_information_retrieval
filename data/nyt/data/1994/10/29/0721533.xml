        <p>Stephen Foster and Friends In an Evening on the Back Porch Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>Thomas Hampson stepped back from the standard art-song repertory on Wednesday evening to explore the world of 19th-century salon songs, particularly those of Stephen Foster. Collaborating with the Jay Unger Trio, Mr. Hampson sang many a Foster favorite -- "Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair," "Gentle Annie," "Old Folks at Home" and "Beautiful Dreamer" were all offered in relaxed, easygoing arrangements -- as well as a few interesting rarities. He also sang a few ballads by Robert Burns and Thomas Moore, who influenced Foster. And Mr. Unger, best known for his soundtrack performances for Ken Burns's "Civil War" series, led his band in Civil War songs and a few robust 19th-century fiddle pieces.</p>

        <p>Stephen Foster and Friends In an Evening on the Back Porch Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>Thomas Hampson stepped back from the standard art-song repertory on Wednesday evening to explore the world of 19th-century salon songs, particularly those of Stephen Foster. Collaborating with the Jay Unger Trio, Mr. Hampson sang many a Foster favorite -- "Jeanie With the Light Brown Hair," "Gentle Annie," "Old Folks at Home" and "Beautiful Dreamer" were all offered in relaxed, easygoing arrangements -- as well as a few interesting rarities. He also sang a few ballads by Robert Burns and Thomas Moore, who influenced Foster. And Mr. Unger, best known for his soundtrack performances for Ken Burns's "Civil War" series, led his band in Civil War songs and a few robust 19th-century fiddle pieces.</p>
        <p>There was a studied informality in Mr. Hampson's presentation. Wearing a vest and an open collar and sitting on a high swivel chair, Mr. Hampson, a baritone, sang effortlessly and chatted amiably between songs, encouraging listeners to sing along and promoting his recent Foster recording (on Angel Records).</p>
        <p>There was evidence that he originally had a more usefully didactic plan. Deane L. Root, the curator of the Stephen Foster Memorial at the University of Pittsburgh, gave a pre-concert lecture on Foster's innovations. The thorough, contextualized annotations that have become standard at Mr. Hampson's recitals were included in the program book, and the program itself was supposed to include Foster and his antecedents before the intermission, with his musical descendants on the second half. The performance, though, was more of an amorphous entertainment, in the style, Mr. Hampson said, of a 19th-century evening on the back porch.</p>
        <p>Actually, some of the most interesting and spirited performances of the evening were the folksy instrumental medleys. The ensemble included Mr. Unger (on violin, banjo, mandolin and harmonica), Molly Mason (on guitar, bass, banjo and piano) and David Alpher (on piano). ALLAN KOZINN</p>
