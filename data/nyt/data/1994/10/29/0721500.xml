        <p>The creation of the first new major baseball league in 80 years will be announced at a news conference in Manhattan next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The United Baseball League sent out a news media advisory yesterday with information about a news conference.</p>
        <p>"The United Baseball League will unveil details and leadership of a new sports enterprise at a news briefing," the advisory said, adding that leaders of the new league would be on hand. The advisory also referred to "the innovative organizational structure that the United League envisions for the American and international sports scene."</p>
        <p>John Griffin, one of the public relations people, declined to add any information about the league, but a lawyer with knowledge of the enterprise identified Richard Moss, former general counsel of the Players Association and a players' agent, and Bob Mrazek, a former five-term Congressman from Long Island, as two of the organizers.</p>
        <p>The lawyer said Moss and Mrazek recently held a meeting with a select group of agents to discuss the league. Asked yesterday about his involvement with the league, Moss said, "I can't really comment on it at this time, but don't be surprised if you see me next Tuesday."</p>
        <p>The lawyer, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said one person who will be seen with Moss is Curt Flood, the player who unsuccessfully challenged baseball's reserve clause nearly 25 years ago.  BASEBALL</p>
