        <p>For two and half years, the drum-shaped Teletrack horse racing theater in New Haven, one of the most visible sites along Interstate 95, has been empty. In August, however, Autotote Enterprises of New Haven bought the three-story, 83,000-square-foot building from General Instrument for $4.7 million. It intends to expand and reopen the 1,800-seat theater by early 1995.</p>
        <p>"Connecticut likes to gamble," said Rick Cowan, president of Autotote. "There is a real market out here for this."</p>

        <p>For two and half years, the drum-shaped Teletrack horse racing theater in New Haven, one of the most visible sites along Interstate 95, has been empty. In August, however, Autotote Enterprises of New Haven bought the three-story, 83,000-square-foot building from General Instrument for $4.7 million. It intends to expand and reopen the 1,800-seat theater by early 1995.</p>
        <p>"Connecticut likes to gamble," said Rick Cowan, president of Autotote. "There is a real market out here for this."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowan said Teletrack had closed in 1992 because it featured only New York races. The new one, he said, will show races from several states, including Florida and California, as well as dog races and jai alai.</p>
        <p>He also said Teletrack would be renovated, "up-scaled" and have several new restaurants. A Teletrack in Windsor Locks, Conn., underwent a similar expansion and renovation 15 months ago, he said, and the response has been higher attendance.</p>
        <p>Selling Teletrack wasn't easy, however. "It's kind of a unique building," said Frederick P. Perella, a senior associate with Cushman &amp; Wakefield in New Haven, which brokered the deal. The asking price was $7 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perella said numerous organizations, including several religious groups, had looked at the 15-year-old building.</p>
