        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his Sept. 25 Soapbox essay, "9:30 P.M., RVSD: a Nonvictim," Adam Rothman characterizes his encounter with a mugger as leaving him "with my wallet, my dignity and his respect." The idea that a potential mugging victim (or rape victim or murder victim, for that matter) should be happy gaining the "respect" of a man who was apparently ready to kill just goes to show how much blaming the victim has become internalized in American society.</p>

        <p>I wonder what the mugger did to the victim he no doubt went on to after Mr. Rothman; the one who couldn't think quickly enough on his or her feet to gain the mugger's respect. ERIC WAKIN Manhattan</p>
