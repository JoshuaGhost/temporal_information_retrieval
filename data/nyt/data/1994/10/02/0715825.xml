        <p>A single shot from a 9-millimeter automatic pistol killed one of Mexico's most important political leaders last week and shattered the sense of calm that Mexicans were just getting accustomed to after an unpredictably violent year.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty and fear linked to the bloody rebel uprising in Chiapas last January, the assassination in March of the governing party's presidential candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio, and the threat of trouble following the Aug. 21 presidential election, had seemed to fade by the time September began.</p>
        <p>Trouble reappeared when electoral officials, claiming fraud, overturned results of the mayoral election in Monterrey, Mexico's third largest city. In Chiapas the Zapatista rebels refused to accept the winner of the governor's race, a candidate of the ruling party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or P.R.I.</p>
        <p>Then, last Wednesday, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, the P.R.I.'s No. 2 man and an important ally of President-elect Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, was shot leaving in downtown Mexico City.</p>
        <p>Police arrested a suspect, who later admitted he had agreed to kill Mr. Ruiz Massieu for the equivalent of about $15,000. Neither the suspect, Daniel Aguilar Trevino , nor authorities have yet explained why Mr. Ruiz Massieu was murdered. After this second assassination in just over six months, the question now asked by many bewildered and frightened Mexicans is, "Who's next?" ANTHONY DePALMA</p>
