        <p>A 60-year-old woman was struck and killed in Queens last night by a car whose driver had an invalid license with multiple suspensions, the police said.</p>
        <p>The woman, who was not identified, was killed instantly when the car struck her at an intersection in Flushing, said Sgt. John McCluskey, a Police Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>The 24-year-old driver, Michael Cornetta of 189-12 43d Avenue, was charged with driving with a suspended license, the sergeant said. His license had been suspended on four separate occasions, but it was not clear what the suspensions were for.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred shortly after 7 P.M. on 46th Avenue and Utopia Parkway, a busy intersection near a neighborhood shopping strip. Mr. Cornetta's 1970 Buick was traveling eastbound on 46th Avenue when the incident occurred.</p>
