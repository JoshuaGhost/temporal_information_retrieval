        <p>Anyone who doubted the depth of the unhappiness over plans to turn five squatter-occupied buildings on East 13th Street into low-income housing had only to attend a community board meeting Thursday.</p>
        <p>With more than 50 police officers patrolling the meeting at Public School 20 on Essex Street, some 80 squatters and supporters marched with drums and banners, to join hundreds of others for two hours of pandemonium. Protesters shouted, chanted and shoved, grabbing the microphone and issuing threats. Board chairman Luis Soler angrily called for calm. "I cannot allow anyone to intimidate the board," he said.</p>
        <p>Peter Spagnuolo, a squatter, warned, "We'll barricade ourselves in our homes and they'll have to use armed force to get us out."</p>
        <p>Board members, some infuriated by the squatters' tactics, retreated behind a barrier of a dozen shield-bearing officers to vote "yes" on the project (to howls of "We know where you live!") or "no." By 8:30 P.M., there were 26 votes for, 2 against, 4 abstentions and 3 arrests for disorderly conduct.</p>
        <p>At issue is a two-year-old plan to turn five city-owned tenements, at 535, 537, 539, 541 and 545 East 13th Street over to the Lower East Side Coalition for Housing Development, a nonprofit group, for conversion to low-income housing.</p>
        <p>The community board's vote is the latest of the official approvals needed for the plan to proceed. In June, the City Council approved the $3.5 million project, to be financed by the city Department of Housing Preservation and Development and corporate tax credits funneled through the Local Initiatives Support Corporation and the Enterprise Foundation.</p>
        <p>While disapproving of the squatters tactics, Armando Perez, the head of Charas, a cultural group, voted no. "Low income housing should be built," he said, "but not at the expense of evicting families."</p>
        <p>Last week, Mara Neville, assistant commissioner of the department, said: "We are planning gut rehabilitation of the East 13th Street buildings, but there is no timetable yet. When the time comes, we will evict the squatters as peaceably as they allow."</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, squatter advocates disrupted a meeting of the community board's housing committee, smashing furniture, throwing stink bombs and finally padlocking members inside the Hamilton Fish Park Recreational Center. M.H.  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: THE VILLAGE, EAST AND WEST</p>
