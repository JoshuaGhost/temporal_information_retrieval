        <p>In a decision that could result in higher electricity rates across the New York region, the governors of 10 Northeastern states have agreed to require power plants to cut pollution from smokestacks sharply over the next nine years.</p>
        <p>The agreement will force utilities and factories to cut, on average by the year 2003, more than two-thirds of the pollution they release into the air, Federal officials say.

        <p>In a decision that could result in higher electricity rates across the New York region, the governors of 10 Northeastern states have agreed to require power plants to cut pollution from smokestacks sharply over the next nine years.</p>
        <p>The agreement will force utilities and factories to cut, on average by the year 2003, more than two-thirds of the pollution they release into the air, Federal officials say. If successful, the measures -- along with recently agreed-upon limits on car emissions -- would substantially improve air quality in the Northeast, these officials say.</p>
        <p>Several power companies said they welcomed the agreement because it offered a flexible approach to reducing plant emissions. But they warned that fitting the costly anti-pollution devices to their oil-and coal-burning boilers would result in rate increases for some customers, although no firm estimates were available.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists, for their part, predicted that the agreement would not reduce pollution enough to meet the requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act. They argued that the proposed regulations had been watered down to let power companies choose the easiest target to meet: either reducing pollution to a fixed level, or by a certain percentage below 1990 levels, something favored by dirtier plants.</p>
        <p>"The way this is designed, the plants that are dirtiest today will remain dirtiest because they will choose the less stringent option," said David Hawkins, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council in Washington. "We think they should have come up with a program that eliminated that choice."</p>
        <p>The agreement, to take effect next year, is part of a larger effort by state governments in the Northeast to meet a requirement to reduce smog under the 1990 Clean Air Act. Because pollutants drift across state boundaries, the act set up a regional body called the Ozone Transport Commission made up of officials from 12 Northeastern states and the District of Columbia. The states are the six New England states, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware and Virginia.</p>
        <p>In February, the commission took a significant step toward reducing smog by voting in favor of strict auto emission standards modeled on California's, including a requirement that automobile companies produce low-emission and electric cars. The Environmental Protection Agency is expected to give final approval to that request next month despite heavy opposition from car makers.</p>
        <p>But Federal and state officials have said that at a minimum, the states will also have to cut in half the tons of pollutants being pumped into the air by power plants and factories with large boilers burning coal or oil.</p>
        <p>On Monday, after two years of meetings and proposals, 10 states and the District of Columbia agreed to do just that. Under the agreement, the region will be divided into three sections, and each section will have to meet certain goals in reducing pollution. Utilities that cut pollution more than required would also be allowed to sell the credit for that reduction to those who fall short of the goals.</p>
        <p>Two states, Massachusetts and Virginia, rejected the agreement, arguing that more studies are needed to demonstrate a need for the standards. And in some states, the regulations must be approved by their legislatures. In New York, the regulations do not need legislative approval.</p>
        <p>When negotiations began, environmentalists had urged the states to adopt an across-the-board cap on pollution for individual plants.</p>
        <p>But several states with a large number of older coal-burning plants, notably Pennsylvania and Maryland, protested that a fixed cap on pollution would prove too costly and would run into stiff opposition from power companies, big businesses and ratepayers. The states argued that since many of their plants are much older, it would be prohibitively expensive to force them to reduce pollution levels to the same levels as regions with newer plants. They urged instead a percentage reduction in pollution.</p>
        <p>"A single meat-ax approach across the region just wasn't going to cut it," said Arthur A. Davis, the secretary of environmental resources in Pennsylvania and the chairman of the transport commission.</p>
        <p>Langdon Marsh, the New York State Commissioner of Environmental Protection, said New York had argued for an absolute standard but later bowed to the political realities on the commission. "From New York's point of view that would be the best thing to do, but there was not a consensus," he said.</p>
        <p>In the end, the group compromised to reach an agreement before Nov. 15, when the states must submit plans to the E.P.A. for cleaning up the air, several members said. They agreed to slightly higher limits, allowing plants to discharge the equivalent of about four pounds of pollution for every ton of coal by 1999. That standard would be tightened to three pounds per ton by 2003 for most of the region.</p>
        <p>But utilities with older plants were given a loophole. If the strict standard is too tough to meet, companies may use a different yardstick: a percentage reduction from 1990 pollution levels. They also agreed that the regulations would be tightened in 1997 if tests show not enough progress has been made.</p>
        <p>Federal environmental officials estimated that the proposed regulations, if enacted, would reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides, a component of smog that comes out of utility smokestacks, by 690,000 tons before 2003, a 69 percent reduction from the 1990 level of one million tons a year.</p>
        <p>Smog is produced when nitrogen oxides and hyrdocarbons react with sunlight to produce ozone. Apart from cars and trucks, power plants and other fossil-fuel-burning boilers are the biggest producers of nitrogen oxides. Before the Clean Air Act was amended in 1990, power plants and factories in the region were producing 1.2 million tons of nitrogen oxides a year while cars and truck spewed out 1.5 million tons.</p>
        <p>Mary Nichols, the E.P.A. assistant administrator for air and radiation, acknowledged that the agreed-upon regulations might not be stringent enough to meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act. "It is true that more reductions may be needed to attain the ozone health standard," she said. "But all of us with responsibility for making public policy need to value the old adage that 'the perfect is the enemy of the good.' "</p>
        <p>Executives at several major utilities in the region said they were relieved that the states had decided on a flexible approach. A fixed standard for emissions across the region would have cost far more to put in place, resulting in significantly higher electric rates, they said. Several said they had already made significant reductions in the last four years to comply with the Clean Air Act, so meeting the new requirements would not be impossible.</p>
        <p>"There were a whole lot worse things that could have happened that were under consideration," said William L. Stillinger, the director of technology planning for Northeast Utilities in Berlin, Conn.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists contend that the states have merely forestalled politically difficult decisions they would eventually have to make. "What they did was settle to a commitment to bake three-quarters of a loaf," Mr. Hawkins said.</p>
