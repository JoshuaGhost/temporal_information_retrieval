        <p>I wonder what sort of world Stephen Dixon (letter, Sept. 28) lives in to suggest that a writer like Allen Ginsberg should donate his papers to a university, rather than sell them? Does Mr. Dixon realize that long-term medical care in this country is not free but expensive?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I wonder what sort of world Stephen Dixon (letter, Sept. 28) lives in to suggest that a writer like Allen Ginsberg should donate his papers to a university, rather than sell them? Does Mr. Dixon realize that long-term medical care in this country is not free but expensive?</p>
        <p>Does Mr. Dixon know Allen Ginsberg is nearly 70 and in frail health, that he has dependents, some of them elderly, unwell and uninsured.</p>
        <p>As Robert Frost wrote:</p>
        <p>Better to go down dignified</p>
        <p>With boughten friendship at your side</p>
        <p>Than none at all. Provide, provide!</p>
        <p>Anyone who has observed Allen Ginsberg closely at all knows that his generosity, with both his money and his time, has always been exemplary.  SAM ABRAMS  Prof. of Language and Literature Rochester Institute of Technology Rochester, Sept. 29, 1994</p>
