        <p>Greyhound Lines Inc. announced today that it would bring back Craig R. Lentzsch, a former vice chairman, to become president and chief executive of a company nearly overwhelmed by losses, debts and passenger desertions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lentzsch, 46, was among the investors who took over Greyhound in a leveraged buyout in 1987. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1990, the year after he left, and is now negotiating an emergency financial overhaul with shareholders and creditors to avoid a repetition.</p>

        <p>Greyhound Lines Inc. announced today that it would bring back Craig R. Lentzsch, a former vice chairman, to become president and chief executive of a company nearly overwhelmed by losses, debts and passenger desertions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lentzsch, 46, was among the investors who took over Greyhound in a leveraged buyout in 1987. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1990, the year after he left, and is now negotiating an emergency financial overhaul with shareholders and creditors to avoid a repetition.</p>
        <p>Andrew Leinoff, a debt analyst at Duff &amp; Phelps, said Greyhound might be beyond hope. "I'm not altogether convinced that anybody can help," he said. "No matter how wonderful the new management might be, they have a fundamental problem that nobody wants to use their product."</p>
        <p>Low gasoline prices, cheap flights and aggressive regional bus lines have cut Greyhound riders from 7.2 million in the first half of 1993 to 6.7 million in the first half of this year.</p>
        <p>Greyhound, the only nationwide bus service, compounded its problems by bungling the introduction of a computerized information and reservations system last year, often leaving passengers unable to get through.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lentzsch will first try to persuade bondholders to exchange some of that debt for new shares, and current shareholders to approve the issuance of more stock. "Without the financial restructuring, all bets are off," he said in an interview. Then, he said, another bankruptcy filing would be "a significant possibility."</p>
        <p>The company's senior debt was quoted at about 60 cents on the dollar today. The stock closed at 27/16 up 1/4. As recently as a year and a half ago, the company raised $100 million by selling shares at $21.25.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lentzsch said he had attracted more riders during his previous stint and could do it again despite tougher competition. While Frank J. Schmieder, who resigned as chief executive last summer, had spoken of concentrating on short trips between major cities, Mr. Lentzsch intends to maintain a full, long-haul system.</p>
        <p>"The fundamental value of Greyhound Lines lies in its national network," he said, adding that he wants to make it easier for riders to transfer from regional lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lentzsch also intends to keep prices lower than for any other transportation competitor and to start answering the phones. "It's pretty hard to get somebody to take the bus if you don't tell them when the bus is leaving," he remarked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lentzsch has been chief financial officer of Motor Coach Industries, Greyhound's largest provider of buses. Noting that many Greyhound managers came from outside the bus business, he repeatedly said that he planned to hire new ones with the right experience.</p>
        <p>He will take over on Nov. 15 from Thomas G. Plaskett, a Greyhound board member and former chief executive of Pan Am, who has been interim chief executive.</p>
