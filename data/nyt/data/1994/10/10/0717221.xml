        <p>Ross Perot, one of America's best-known talkers, officially became a talk-radio host tonight with the exhortation, "Call in and get in line, because the phones are ringing tonight, and believe me, the roof is shaking in Washington!"</p>
        <p>The Dallas billionaire certainly did his part to get things shaking on his new one-hour, nationally syndicated show, calling President Clinton a draft dodger and Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a drug dealer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot, who drew 19 percent of the vote as an independent Presidential candidate two years ago, reiterated suggestions he had made in recent days that control of Congress should be turned over to the Republicans to "see if things get any better -- if they don't, I promised the American people we'd start a third party."</p>
        <p>And the new host was scathingly critical of Mr. Clinton's conduct of foreign policy, especially his handling of Saddam Hussein, the President of Iraq.</p>
        <p>"He's back," Mr. Perot said of Mr. Hussein. "He's crazy, he's smart, and he's back. We have known he was coming back. The C.I.A. knows the license plates on everything that moves over there. Don't you find it interesting that suddenly it becomes a front-page story 30 days before the election and we're sending in 4,000 marines at warp speed?"</p>
        <p>Several of the nearly two dozen people whose calls were taken during the program said they were faithful supporters of Mr. Perot, and at least two identified themselves as organizers for his group, United We Stand America.</p>
        <p>But if a talk-radio format implies freewheeling conversation between host and caller, Mr. Perot's debut may well have been mislabeled. Typically, callers would ask a brief question that would prompt a homily from Mr. Perot, who then concluded by saying that the lines were jammed with fervent callers and he needed to take the next one. Most calls lasted less than a minute.</p>
        <p>To Joseph, a caller in Perry, Fla., who complained of an unspecified "systematic poisoning" of people in his hometown, Mr. Perot responded: "It's time to send in the marines, isn't it? Too bad they're halfway around the world." A woman named Alicia from Long Island asked Mr. Perot whether his entry into the 1992 Presidential race had ultimately been responsible for Mr. Clinton's election. Mr. Perot vehemently denied it. "All I did was stop Clinton from getting a landslide," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perot also used the program to condemn Mr. Aristide, saying Clinton Administration officials had made him out to be "the second coming of George Washington" when he was, according to information Mr. Perot said he had received from Government sources, "a major drug trafficker in Haiti."</p>
        <p>The program, to be broadcast weekly on Sunday evenings for at least the next several months, was available in 83 media markets from coast to coast last night, according to Tribune Radio Networks, the program's syndicator, based in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Perot is not a declared candidate for any office, the program is not subject to any Federal regulations that might require equal time for his opponents. Mr. Perot says he is not paying for any of the air time, but terms of his contract with the syndicator and payment to him, if any, have not been disclosed.</p>
        <p>The radio host was no less bombastic this morning as a guest on the CBS News program "Face the Nation." On that program, Mr. Perot appeared to suggest that the Clinton Administration had purposely allowed the situations in both Haiti and Iraq to escalate to the verge of military conflicts to boost the President's political popularity.</p>
        <p>"We're about to have an election, right?" Mr. Perot said. "This is the old game. The first war didn't get him a bump in the polls; now let's try a second one."  THE 1994 CAMPAIGN: INDEPENDENT</p>
