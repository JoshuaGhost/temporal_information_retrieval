        <p>Cindy Mooney just wanted to have a private word with her elected officials when she called Town Hall here the other night. Instead, people all over town wound up hearing what she had to say.</p>
        <p>"I guess I'm on a speaker phone, is that right?" a puzzled Ms. Mooney asked when her call was patched through to a Town Board meeting.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mooney had unknowingly stumbled onto this Westchester town's attempt to bring democracy into the electronic age -- an experiment in which town meetings feature call-in segments that are broadcast on the local cable-access television station.</p>
        <p>Initially, some officials wondered if they were inviting trouble. "Some Council members were skeptical," said Paul J. Feiner, the Town Supervisor. "They were concerned about people cursing us, insulting us. I figured people already insult us at our Town Board meetings, so why should we be afraid of somebody insulting us by telephone?"</p>
        <p>The program -- equal parts "Larry King Live" and C-Span -- allows people to participate in government meetings -- questioning town officials, giving testimony and engaging in debate -- without leaving their living rooms.</p>
        <p>The notion of using technology this way was advocated by Ross Perot during the 1992 Presidential election campaign. But Greenburgh is one of a handful of communities across the country that have tried to put the concept into practice.</p>
        <p>"The implications of what they're doing in Greenburgh are phenomenal," said Michael Harrison, the editor of Talkers, a magazine that covers talk radio. "They've demystified government by bringing it into the home. It's opened up the process for everyone in town."</p>
        <p>But this application of technology has raised questions about how far elected officials can go in tinkering with the machinery of representative democracy.</p>
        <p>More ambitious efforts elsewhere -- like a two-way television service introduced in several cities by Warner Amex Cable Corporation creating "electronic plebiscites" on local affairs -- have been discontinued. Among the problems were a lack of interest and participation.</p>
        <p>"People don't necessarily want to vote," said Bill McGill, the deputy city manager of Upper Arlington, Ohio, a suburb of Columbus, where the Warner Amex two-way television service was tried. "That's what they've elected officials to do. Why would they want to vote?"</p>
        <p>In Greenburgh, officials are looking into the legality of using the technology to allow Town Council members to vote during government meetings they are unable to attend. "This is an experiment," said Mr. Feiner, who proposed the idea to his colleagues. "We have to refine and improve it. But its potential is limitless."</p>
        <p>In Reading, Pa., which has pioneered the use of such technology, officials have been wary of having their deliberations disrupted by verbal attacks from anonymous callers, and so have not used the call-in format at meetings.</p>
        <p>"You can be a real brave person when no one knows who you are," said Bill Martin, who coordinates the city's programs on the local cable-access station. "You don't have to be responsible with what you say because you can always deny you called."</p>
        <p>Instead, individual officials in that city of 75,000 have been host to weekly programs on the cable-access station in which they take questions from residents and try to gauge public opinion on issues like zoning. Calls are limited to four minutes, and no one is permitted to call more than once per program.</p>
        <p>For their part, officials in Greenburgh have tried to insure orderliness by instituting time limits on calls, barring personal attacks, asking callers to limit their comments to local issues, setting aside a specified block of time during meetings for calls and disconnecting callers who get out of hand.</p>
        <p>There is even a screener who sits in a rear office asking callers to give their names, phone numbers and the topics they wish to discuss.</p>
        <p>"If somebody wants to insult someone," Mr. Feiner announced at the beginning of a recent meeting, "we will either hang up on them or transfer them to 1-800-HOWARD STERN."</p>
        <p>To many here, it is not surprising that Greenburgh has taken such an innovative approach in opening up the democratic process. After all, this is the town where officials have had meetings at parks, beside a swimming pool and inside grocery stores to give residents greater access.</p>
        <p>Although the call-in program started just last month, there are signs that it is beginning to catch on. The town's Planning Board is considering adopting the format, and the local Democratic committee used it during a recent gathering at Town Hall.</p>
        <p>More than two dozen people called during last month's two Town Board meetings, voicing concerns on a broad range of issues, from traffic safety and commercial development to noisy leaf blowers.</p>
        <p>But not everyone in at a recent meeting was pleased with the intrusion from home viewers.</p>
        <p>"I suggest you stop on the telephone calls," one man piped in after a rambling call. "These people go on and on and on. And you give them no time limit."</p>
        <p>Mr. Feiner responded, "We give them two minutes."</p>
        <p>The man shot back, "You're interfering with the meeting."</p>
        <p>But in an age of increasingly tight schedules, many residents in this town of 83,000 have embraced the call-in format as a convenient way to have a role in government affairs.</p>
        <p>Murray Schwab said he was too busy helping his son with homework to attend a Town Board meeting last month. Nevertheless, Mr. Schwab wanted to voice his opposition to a proposal for new tennis courts. So he picked up the telephone and became the first resident to use the service.</p>
        <p>"This is a great idea for an average person like me who can't go to every meeting," Mr. Schwab said. "This system gives me a voice. I wish they would do something like this up in Albany."</p>
        <p>Before the call-in segment was instituted, Jaman Bates used to get frustrated watching the televised Town Board meetings. He recalled one meeting last year in which officials refused to answer questions about a town employee who was dismissed for skimming town funds.</p>
        <p>"I was pretty mad, cursing and screaming at my TV," Mr. Bates recalled. "I wanted to go down to the meeting and speak my mind."</p>
        <p>But he did not suffer quietly one night last month when he made a call to the Town Board meeting to ask officials what they planned to do about an abandoned building that has become an eyesore in his neighborhood.</p>
        <p>"I don't have a lot of time, but I try to be involved with what's going on in Greenburgh," he said. "That's why this call-in is a good thing for people like me."</p>
        <p>As for Ms. Mooney, she has since learned that her call -- to urge officials to ban noisy leaf blowers -- wound up being broadcast for all her neighbors to hear.</p>
        <p>It took her by surprise, she said. "But I think the electronic town hall is a great way to open up communication between constituents and government. Whether I'll use it again depends on the issue."</p>
