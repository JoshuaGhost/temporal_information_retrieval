        <p>For most fashion insiders, this season will be remembered as the one when Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace seemed to have switched roles: Armani, known for his good taste, showed a sexually charged collection today; Versace, known for his sexually charged collections, did a collection in good taste the day before.</p>
        <p>Of course, the terms "sexually charged" and "good taste" are relative. There was still sexiness in Versace's good taste and good taste in Armani's new sexiness. But it is Armani who left his audience more stunned. Good taste, after all, stuns no one. The industry is reacting to Armani, with his more voluptuous vision, a bit like one might to a boss who has brought an 18-year-old girlfriend to a party. And since Armani is a safe harbor for every retailer, there are bound to be some waves.</p>

        <p>For most fashion insiders, this season will be remembered as the one when Giorgio Armani and Gianni Versace seemed to have switched roles: Armani, known for his good taste, showed a sexually charged collection today; Versace, known for his sexually charged collections, did a collection in good taste the day before.</p>
        <p>Of course, the terms "sexually charged" and "good taste" are relative. There was still sexiness in Versace's good taste and good taste in Armani's new sexiness. But it is Armani who left his audience more stunned. Good taste, after all, stuns no one. The industry is reacting to Armani, with his more voluptuous vision, a bit like one might to a boss who has brought an 18-year-old girlfriend to a party. And since Armani is a safe harbor for every retailer, there are bound to be some waves.</p>
        <p>Armani has also provided a safe harbor for those with something to hide under a loose, forgiving suit, but there was no hiding in this show. Trousers were sheer, and jackets with looped buttons opened to reveal bra tops. Every skirt was short -- some flounced and tiered, some straight and slit up the sides, others with ruffles that draped over ruffled shorts. Even the safest chalk-stripe pants suits opened to show gray bra tops.</p>
        <p>Having discovered the bustier, Armani used it in every way. He layered it over sheer dresses for an Empire effect. He put it under a shimmery silver-collared shirt with an organza skirt. He built it into his jackets to give them a fitted form. He put it under a series of jackets that were wrapped shut with braided satin rope belts. There were banded halter tops that crossed well above the waist, worn under soft jackets with drawstring pants. And there were beautiful little jackets that tied with ribbons instead of buttoning, some double breasted, some with three little ribbons up the front and a bra peeking from beneath.</p>
        <p>This was a collection without a single sharp edge, save the stern little stilettos that models tick-tacked across the runway in. Lapels turned softly back, with no peaks. Tiny buttons closed some slim-shouldered jackets, stopping just at the breast, and then the fluid lines of the jacket flowed into the lettuce leaf hem of a skirt fluttering beneath.  Florals and ferns were strewn delicately across fabrics, elaborate lace patterns decorated sheer shirts, pretty brocades made light jackets, and a cascade of shimmery organza flowed from beneath tight bodices.</p>
        <p>The show was successful, even beautiful. But it was disorienting to see Armani, who normally resides in a citadel of his own style, appear to be following trends.</p>
        <p>At their best, runway shows are a careful mixture of art and commerce; at their worst, they offer grotesque caricatures of women. If Armani's was an example of the former, offering retailers the powerful combination of a hot trend and a 24-karat imprimatur, Dolce &amp; Gabbana's presentation this afternoon of the lower-priced D &amp; G collection was an example of the latter.</p>
        <p>It was as if the audience had entered the dream sequence of a heavy metal music video. There was a seemingly unending parade of very young women mostly undressed, mostly undignified, with thigh-high hose, stilettos, Lolita heart-shaped sunglasses, plastic shower curtains made into trench coats, bras showing through dresses, or above them.</p>
        <p>It's remarkable how many cinema images can be brought to mind by the word "prostitute." D &amp; G had them all on the runway, from the stripper Replicant, in "Blade Runner," wearing a clear plastic raincoat, to Jody Foster in "Taxi Driver," whom the design team cited as their muse. Ms. Foster's performance "perfectly captured," they wrote in their program notes, how "an imperceptible borderline exists between adolescence and one's own femininity, between being a girl and the aspiration towards becoming a woman." Maybe it lost something in the translation.</p>
        <p>Katharine Hamnett, on the other hand, with almost no two pieces alike in her collection, designs for women as quirky individuals. Ms. Hamnett, a British designer, is the life of the party in the Milan show schedule. And she has the same problem that all lively guests at serious parties do: everyone enjoys her company but wonders what's in it for her. Her kindred spirits, designers tuned into the London scene, have taken their collections to Paris and New York.</p>
        <p>Like an opera singer flaunting her range, Ms. Hamnett started with a witty group she called "crazy golf" -- cashmere sweaters printed with argyles and figures of Scottie dogs and of golfers teeing off, short plaid golf pants, little vests and tiny zip-front skirts. Then she did a knowing take on 1970's disco, with shiny black cat suits over bra tops, Courreges- style squared-off shiny dresses and skirts, a zip-front stand-up-collar dress and a miniskirt in two pieces, held together by a silver chain. She showed a zebra-print pink and blue dress, a suede pink halter top, pink go-go boots and diamond-studded jean jackets. There were also tidy little Jackie Onassis suits in bright pink. Ms. Hamnett is no dictator, and she offered something for almost everyone.</p>
