        <p>The inspiration for Westchester County's so-called workfare program -- which Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wants to copy in New York City -- was a slew of dead, smelly fish called mossbunkers.</p>
        <p>When the fishkill hit the shores of Rye, Mamaroneck and Larchmont some years ago, county officials thought about who they could assign to clean up the mess -- and had a brainstorm. Why not the single, able-bodied people receiving welfare from the county?</p>
        <p>Mary E. Glass, then an assistant commissioner for social services assigned to County Executive Andrew O'Rourke's office, said she and Mr. O'Rourke devised a program to require Home Relief recipients to work 20 hours a week on public projects.</p>
        <p>That program was set up five years ago (too late to clean up the fishkill) and christened Pride in Work, but Miss Glass, now the county's Commissioner of Social Services, said she and other county officials referred to it by a different name: the mossbunker program. "We didn't say that publicly, but we said it to each other privately," she said.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, able-bodied recipients of Home Relief, the welfare program for single people, must now remove graffiti, paint park benches and swimming pools, pick up trash along the railroad and do other unskilled jobs requested by county or municipal government agencies.</p>
        <p>About 13 percent of the 6,671 people receiving Home Relief in the county are currently assigned to the program. They do the work in exchange for their monthly welfare benefits, which average $400 a month in rental allowances and cash grants, as well as Medicaid benefits that the county values at $440 a month.</p>
        <p>"If people walk off the job, we cut them off welfare," Mr. O'Rourke said. "If they call in and say they're sick, we have them examined by a doctor."</p>
        <p>Those who are homeless, sick, disabled, in training programs or over 60 years old -- the vast majority of recipients -- are exempt.</p>
        <p>County officials say the program, combined with a tough new screening process for new Home Relief applicants, has kept the caseload down. It has grown less than 1 percent since 1990, while New York City's has grown 59 percent, Nassau 93 percent and Suffolk 9 percent.</p>
        <p>Beginning last year, the county began investigating all applicants, rather than spot-checking a fraction. County workers visit the home of each applicant, contact landlords and past employers, and check credit references, officials said.</p>
        <p>Miss Glass said the county has found that 30 percent of applicants are not eligible for benefits, often because they failed to report off-the-books income or lied about where or with whom they live.</p>
        <p>County officials said they do not know how many of the people in the program got other jobs later.</p>
        <p>Studies of such programs by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a national nonprofit group that evaluates welfare experiments, have found they do little to better participants' job prospects.</p>
        <p>But Mr. O'Rourke said he is convinced the program helps people get back on their feet while doing good work for the county.</p>
        <p>"We have the only graffiti-free parkway in the world," Mr. O'Rourke said. "In New York City, you could have an army of people taking off graffiti."</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Rourke himself was on welfare as a child because his mother was blind and his father dead. He said he keenly remembers the shame he felt about being on welfare. After he graduated from college, he worked as a welfare caseworker in the mid-1950's around Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. He said both experiences of the welfare system convinced him of its failings.</p>
        <p>Of the $26 million the county spends on Home Relief, $2 million pays the salaries of 48 workfare supervisors and other staff members who carry out the program.</p>
