        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It has become fashionable for the authors of popular books on social issues to claim the status of "amateur anthropologist." Upon reading your review of Julia Blackburn's "Daisy Bates in the Desert" (Aug. 14), in which Linda Simon called Bates "a self-taught anthropologist," my wife, a journalist, asked me, a professional anthropologist, just what an amateur anthropologist is. I wasn't sure. No one speaks of amateur doctors, amateur lawyers or amateur journalists, and to call someone an amateur psychologist is vaguely insulting, not book-jacket copy.</p>
        <p>I do, however, know what a professional anthropologist is. The 10,000 or so of us in the United States are professionals because our careers are focused on anthropological research, teaching and writing. We share an understanding of the basic concepts and methods used in anthropology, we have conducted field research, we have credentials in the form of master's degrees and Ph.D.'s and we are participants in the profession.</p>

        <p>It has become fashionable for the authors of popular books on social issues to claim the status of "amateur anthropologist." Upon reading your review of Julia Blackburn's "Daisy Bates in the Desert" (Aug. 14), in which Linda Simon called Bates "a self-taught anthropologist," my wife, a journalist, asked me, a professional anthropologist, just what an amateur anthropologist is. I wasn't sure. No one speaks of amateur doctors, amateur lawyers or amateur journalists, and to call someone an amateur psychologist is vaguely insulting, not book-jacket copy.</p>
        <p>I do, however, know what a professional anthropologist is. The 10,000 or so of us in the United States are professionals because our careers are focused on anthropological research, teaching and writing. We share an understanding of the basic concepts and methods used in anthropology, we have conducted field research, we have credentials in the form of master's degrees and Ph.D.'s and we are participants in the profession.</p>
        <p>It seems to me that those who claim amateur status as anthropologists do so because they have traveled widely, because they are observers of the human scene, because they have an interest in non-Western cultures or because they have taken a class in anthropology at some point in their careers. Traveling widely generally makes one a tourist. An interest in non-Western cultures means that one is curious. Observing the human scene means that one is a normal human being, and taking courses makes one educated. While anthropologists are human, educated and curious, and as a rule enjoy travel, that is only part of what makes us anthropologists.</p>
        <p>While I am happy to see the words "anthropology" and "anthropologist" in print as often as possible, I am troubled by the misuse of the concepts and methods and terminology of the profession, creating a distorted image of the way anthropology increases our understanding of the human situation, past and present and across cultures. I would like to think that we professional anthropologists and professional writers could collaborate, sharing ideas and information.</p>
        <p>Readers would be better served by writers who write -- from their observations of the human condition, of course, as writers always have -- leaving anthropology to those whose profession it is. DAVID LEVINSON New Haven</p>
