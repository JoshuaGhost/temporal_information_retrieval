        <p>When Pope John Paul II announced that he was canceling his fall trip to the United States because of poor health, he did more than just disappoint the many American Catholics who were passionately counting on his visit. He also put a glitch into the plans of Alfred A. Knopf, the American publisher that recently paid nearly $9 million for the chance to publish a book of his religious and philosophical musings.</p>
        <p>Though the Pope was in no way planning to hawk his forthcoming book, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," by appearing on talk shows or signing copies at bookstores, his very presence would have drawn constant attention to the book and its message and would have been one of the best built-in marketing campaigns a book could have.</p>

        <p>When Pope John Paul II announced that he was canceling his fall trip to the United States because of poor health, he did more than just disappoint the many American Catholics who were passionately counting on his visit. He also put a glitch into the plans of Alfred A. Knopf, the American publisher that recently paid nearly $9 million for the chance to publish a book of his religious and philosophical musings.</p>
        <p>Though the Pope was in no way planning to hawk his forthcoming book, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," by appearing on talk shows or signing copies at bookstores, his very presence would have drawn constant attention to the book and its message and would have been one of the best built-in marketing campaigns a book could have.</p>
        <p>It is hard to calculate exactly how the huge media attention generated by the Pope's visit would have translated into book sales, publishers say, but the appearance of an author of his stature can often provide an enormous surge in sales.</p>
        <p>Without the Pope's visit (he plans to make the trip next year, if his health permits), several rival publishers said, the equation changes for Knopf, which took a big chance when it agreed to spend such an enormous amount on the book in the first place.</p>
        <p>"It isn't going to help, that's for sure," said the publisher of a rival house. "They paid so much money for the book that they really need to take it to a transcendent level. We all know that the author's being present helps, and without him it will be very damaging."</p>
        <p>But Sonny Mehta, publisher and editor in chief of Knopf, said he was not especially worried about the Pope's cancellation, particularly as orders from bookstores had held firm. "I'd much rather he hadn't adjusted his plans, but we haven't substantially altered ours," Mr. Mehta said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mehta said that the Pope's book -- which has a first printing of about one million copies -- should be in stores across the country around Oct. 20.</p>
        <p>Among other things, the company plans to market the book heavily to religious bookstores and to Spanish-speaking Catholics in a Spanish-language edition. And of course, there is an enormous built-in audience of Catholic readers, presumably the same audience that has propelled sales of the hefty revised catechism of the Catholic Church to well past the 1.5 million mark.</p>
        <p>But how the book does in stores remains to be seen. In addition to the Pope's canceled trip, sales might also suffer from the numerous re-issues of various books by and about the Pope that have been previously published for tiny advances and have not done particularly well. "This is bound to have an impact, particularly with so much other stuff coming out at the same time," one publisher said.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Mehta, Knopf has one of the best reputations in the business for its ability to publish, market and sell books. It has also had a terrific year, a result in large part of the runaway success of "In the Kitchen With Rosie," a low-fat cookbook by Rosie Daley, Oprah Winfrey's chef, which was published six months ago and is still going strong on best-seller lists.</p>
        <p>All this means, rival publishers and people within Knopf say, that Mr. Mehta's standing will not suffer if the Pope's book ends up selling poorly.</p>
        <p>In the eyes of colleagues, at least, it is Mr. Mehta's boss, Alberto Vitale, the president and chief executive of Random House Inc., who really lobbied for the project and who would be most embarrassed if it failed. "It's my company reading that it's very much an Alberto enterprise, rather than a Sonny enterprise," said an editor at the company, who insisted on anonymity.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS</p>
