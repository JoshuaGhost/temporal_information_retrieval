        <p>The evolution of Hawaii's architecture from the grass shack of the 19th century to the buildings of the 1990's will be described in an exhibit this fall and winter at the Gentry Pacific Design Center in Honolulu.</p>
        <p>"From Grass to Glass: The Search for a Hawaiian Sense of Place" will spotlight Hawaii-based architects whose commercial and residential structures are considered leading examples of a Hawaiian style of design. The exhibit, which will include photographs and models of buildings, will run from Oct. 28 to Jan. 8.</p>
        <p>Visitors will enter the show through a grass house, turn a corner and find themselves in a glass-walled room. The exhibit will pay particular attention to C. W. Dickey, who worked in the 1920's and 30's, and Vladimir Ossipoff, identified with the modern movement of the postwar years. Among Dickey's best-known work is Honolulu's Alexander and Baldwin Building on Bishop Street, designed in collaboration with Hart Wood. Ossipoff's work includes the Outrigger Canoe Club just below Diamond Head in Waikiki. Both men's styles often incorporated broad porches and interior courtyards to bring the outdoors in.</p>
        <p>The show will be held in the second-floor atrium and galleries of the Gentry Pacific Design Center, 560 North Nimitz Highway,from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. daily. Admission is free. More information: (808) 599-8200.  TRAVEL ADVISORY</p>
