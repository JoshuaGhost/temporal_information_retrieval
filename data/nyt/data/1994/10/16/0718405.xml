        <p>If you're looking for real life, go to the mall. Opera -- or at least a lot of opera -- is the big issues of existence blown up on giant billboards. Things are larger than you're used to, including the sopranos. Get used to being patient. Music moves more slowly than acting and words; don't mind people standing around on stage. Overlook a lot of plot and staging. Much of the music is permanently attached to theatrical values that may have worked 150 years ago but seem kind of silly now. The truth is in the music. If you can't believe what your eyes are seeing, listen: your ears can. It's a world with a reality all its own.</p>
        <p>Here is a starter list for newcomers:</p>
        <p>1. "La Boheme" by Puccini. Starving artists in love. Deserves its popularity. CITY OPERA, Oct. 22, 25, 28; Nov. 2, 5; April 14, 18, 22. MET: Oct. 20; March 8, 11, 14, 18.</p>

        <p>2. "La Traviata" by Verdi. Courtesans and consumption, the medical kind. Glitter and tragedy. Act One is nonstop brilliance. CITY OPERA, March 16, 25, 28; April 1, 6, 8, 16, 19. MET: Feb. 13, 17, 22, 25; March 2, 9, 13, 17, 20, 24, 30; April 5, 8, 11.</p>
        <p>3. "Don Giovanni" by Mozart. Sex, violence, humor and the supernatural in Seville. Some think the best of them all. MET: Nov. 17, 21, 25, 28; Dec. 2, 6, 10, 16, 20, 24.</p>
        <p>4. "Cavalleria Rusticana" by Mascagni. Short, brutal story. Love triangles and murder. Never keeps us waiting. MET: Oct. 24, 28; Nov. 2, 5, 9, 12, 15, 19; Feb. 1, 4, 7, 10, 16.</p>
        <p>5. "Carmen" by Bizet. Has its troughs, but the music at its best is pure sunshine. CITY OPERA: Oct. 23; March 5, 11, 14, 17, 24, 29.</p>
        <p>6. "Wozzeck" by Berg. The musical language will be strange to beginners, but the drama is as gripping as it it is sordid. None better in our time. The Cleveland Orchestra will perform this in concert form at Carnegie Hall, Jan. 28.</p>
        <p>7. "Boris Godunov" by Mussorgsky. Generous panorama of Russian history.</p>
        <p>8. "The Magic Flute" by Mozart. Solemn mysticism set against high good humor. CITY OPERA Oct. 22, 26; Nov. 4.</p>
        <p>9. "Faust" by Gounod. Not good for the blood sugar, but the tunes are irresistable.</p>
        <p>10. "Tosca" by Puccini. Police work, Italian style. Fidelity and betrayal. No trouble telling the good guys from the bad. Swift, streamlined melodrama. MET: Oct. 18, 22, 27, 31; Nov. 4; March 22, 25, 29; April 1.  CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK</p>
