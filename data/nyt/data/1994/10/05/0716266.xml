        <p>Goodbye to the Farm</p>
        <p>Charles Chevillot has closed La Petite Ferme, his restaurant at 973 Lexington Avenue, near 70th Street, which for years drew fashionable patrons like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. "It has been 23 years, and you don't have the same energy after all that time," he said. He is considering opening a country inn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chevillot originally opened the restaurant in 1971 in the tiny space on West 10th Street that now houses La Metairie. In 1978, he packed up his pair of trademark white doves and moved uptown.</p>

        <p>Goodbye to the Farm</p>
        <p>Charles Chevillot has closed La Petite Ferme, his restaurant at 973 Lexington Avenue, near 70th Street, which for years drew fashionable patrons like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. "It has been 23 years, and you don't have the same energy after all that time," he said. He is considering opening a country inn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chevillot originally opened the restaurant in 1971 in the tiny space on West 10th Street that now houses La Metairie. In 1978, he packed up his pair of trademark white doves and moved uptown.</p>
        <p>Gerard Oliver is taking over the Lexington Avenue space and plans to open Le Petit Hulot there on Nov. 1. He and his partner, Richard Egan, are closing Hulot's, two blocks north, because they could not negotiate a satisfactory new lease.  Restaurants and Satellites</p>
        <p>Most double-barreled restaurants open their main dining rooms first and add an informal bistro or cafe later. But Erik Blauberg, the chef and an owner of American Renaissance, a multilevel space (complete with waterfall) in the landmark American Thread Building, 260 West Broadway (at Walker Street), in TriBeCa, has done the reverse.</p>
        <p>Last month he opened the Cafe at American Renaissance, which serves food that is more serious -- and expensive -- than one might expect in a cafe. Main dishes like herbed ravioli with lobster and mushrooms, or braised cod with vegetables and fingerling potatoes, are $14 to $18.</p>
        <p>On Monday, he opened the main restaurant, where the menu is in the same spirit, but entree prices are about $10 higher.</p>
        <p>At the Cub Room, which opened this summer at 131 Sullivan Street (at Prince Street), in SoHo, the owners, Henry Meer and Philip Saunders, followed the more traditional route. They have just opened the Cub Room Cafe, 185 Prince Street (near Sullivan Street), the space formerly occupied by Elephant and Castle. It has a salad and sandwich menu and looks as though it had been there forever.  Mondays at Chanterelle</p>
        <p>Next week, Chanterelle, 2 Harrison Street (at Hudson Street), in TriBeCa, breaks a longstanding tradition: it will open on Mondays, but only for dinner. "Our clients have been asking for it," said Karen Waltuck, who owns the restaurant with her husband, David Waltuck. Young Chef for Judson Grill</p>
        <p>Judson Grill, at 152 West 52d Street, now has one of the youngest executive chefs in town. John Villa, 24, who was a sous chef at the restaurant when it opened, last winter, has been named to the post vacated this summer by Ed Brown. Mr. Villa is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, and his style blends American, Mediterranean and Asian influences. He has hired his older brother, Jerry, as a sous chef. Healthy Candle Expands</p>
        <p>The Healthy Candle, a juice bar and health-food cafe that had been at Lexington Avenue and 71st Street for 10 years, has moved into a larger, less cluttered and more serene space, at 1307 Third Avenue (near 75th Street). It has been renamed the Candle Cafe. An expanded vegetarian menu (good soups, chili, sandwiches on peasant bread and a tempeh-portobello mushroom burger) is being prepared by Cliff Preefer, a lawyer turned vegan chef. Laura Belle Is Back</p>
        <p>Laura Belle, the supper club at 120 West 43d Street, which closed several months ago, has reopened. It is used mostly for private parties but is open to the public for dancing and light food on Saturday nights after 10 P.M., with late Friday evenings to follow soon.</p>
        <p>Buzzy O'Keeffe, an owner, said he had closed because crowds at another club on the block had led to street closings and a large police presence. "Our business dropped off to zero," he said. "But they closed the other club and the block is pristine, so we're reopening."</p>
