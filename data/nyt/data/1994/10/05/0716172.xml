        <p>Government officials said today that they would charge a former federal official and a fugitive congressman with plotting the assassination of the second-ranking leader of Mexico's governing party.</p>
        <p>The prosecution of the two men, one of them formerly a close political associate of the slain party leader, Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, suggests that the authorities' theory is that the motive for the killing was at least in part personal revenge.</p>
        <p>But officials emphasized that they had not ruled out the possibility that Mr. Ruiz Massieu had been the victim of a plot involving major cocaine traffickers, conservative politicians within the governing party, or both.</p>
        <p>"What is coming to the surface are the resentments of some minor politicians," one official familiar with the investigation said, referring to the two suspects. "But these two still appear to be intermediaries. It is possible that there are others behind them."</p>
        <p>In a letter sent to the Attorney General on Sunday, the fugitive legislator, Manuel Munoz Rocha, admitted having taken part in the plot, but said he had done so largely on behalf of the former federal official, Abrahan Rubio Canales.</p>
        <p>Mr. Munoz also said in the letter that he feared for his life, alluding to contacts between Mr. Rubio Canales and leaders of one of Mexico's biggest cocaine smuggling organizations. Officials confirmed the authenticity of the letter.</p>
        <p>The question of motive is complicated in part by the political origins of Mr. Munoz Rocha and Mr. Rubio Canales in the Gulf Coast state of Tamaulipas, a place where political power, corruption and drugs have long been part of one stew.</p>
        <p>Both men rose there through the ranks of the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, under local political bosses who have been variously linked to hard-line factions of the party that oppose recent moves toward reform, to narcotics traffickers and to a former leader of the oil workers' union who was jailed six years ago by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.</p>
        <p>In 1987, the year before Mr. Salinas was elected, he was instrumental in winning Mr. Ruiz Massieu the PRI's nomination for the governorship of the western state of Guerrero. The two men had been friends and close allies throughout their political careers, and Mr. Ruiz Massieu (pronounced roo-EASE MAH-see-eh) was married for a time to Mr. Salinas's sister.</p>
        <p>On the recommendation of a Tamaulipas political leader whom Mr. Ruiz Massieu had known, Mr. Rubio Canales traversed the country to help run his successful gubernatorial campaign. After the election, Mr. Ruiz Massieu had Mr. Rubio Canales put in charge of a federal land development agency in Acapulco, Guerrero's largest city.</p>
        <p>Government officials said the relationship had soured after Mr. Rubio Canales was charged with defrauding the Government of millions of dollars in the sale of federal lands under his control.</p>
        <p>One official familiar with the murder investigation said Mr. Rubio Canales had been deeply angered when Mr. Ruiz Massieu had not interceded with federal investigators on his behalf. Until late last week, when prosecutors began questioning him in connection with the murder, he had been serving a 14-year sentence in a Guerrero prison.</p>
        <p>On Monday, a caller identifying himself as Mr. Munoz Rocha telephoned the offices of the governing-party leader in the lower house of Congress, and admitted to a role in the killing. The caller accused Mr. Rubio Canales of responsibility for the slaying, and said he would turn himself in to the authorities if his personal safety was assured.</p>
        <p>At least seven other people have also been implicated in the attack on Mr. Ruiz Massieu, 48, which took place as he was driven from a meeting in downtown Mexico City last Wednesday morning. The man believed to have recruited most of the suspects, Fernando Rodriguez, worked on the staff of the Water Resources Commission of the lower house of Congress, over which Mr. Munoz Rocha, 47, presided.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rodriguez also remains a fugitive. But investigators have reported that his brother, Jorge, who was captured after the killing, told them that Mr. Ruiz Massieu was apparently on a list of important politicians whom Mr. Munoz Rocha wanted killed because they supported political reforms.</p>
        <p>The evidence that the slaying might be linked to drugs is vague, stemming in part from the fact that a son or nephew of Mr. Rubio Canales is married to a daughter of a major cocaine trafficker. One Government official also said Mr. Rubio Canales had been investigated in connection with the laundering of drug profits in Acapulco.</p>
