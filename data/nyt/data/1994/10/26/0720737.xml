        <p>Following is an excerpt from the debate last night between Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, at Faneuil Hall in Boston, as transcribed by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Q.  Mr. Romney, you personally oppose abortion and as a church leader have advised women not to have an abortion. Given that, how could you in good conscience support a law that enables women to have an abortion, and even lets the Government pay for it? If abortion is morally wrong, aren't you responsible for discouraging it?</p>

        <p>Following is an excerpt from the debate last night between Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, at Faneuil Hall in Boston, as transcribed by The New York Times.</p>
        <p>Q.  Mr. Romney, you personally oppose abortion and as a church leader have advised women not to have an abortion. Given that, how could you in good conscience support a law that enables women to have an abortion, and even lets the Government pay for it? If abortion is morally wrong, aren't you responsible for discouraging it?</p>
        <p>ROMNEY One of the great things about our nation, Sally  [ Sally Jacobs of The Boston Globe ] , is that we're each entitled to have strong personal beliefs, and we encourage other people to do the same. But as a nation we recognize the right of all people to believe as they want, and not to impose our beliefs on other people. I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country; I have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a U.S. Senate candidate.</p>
        <p>I believe that Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, that we should sustain and support it, and I sustain and support that law and the right of a woman to make that choice. And my personal beliefs, like the personal beliefs of other people, should not be brought into a political campaign. Too much has been written about religion in this race. I'm proud of my religious heritage; I am proud of the values that it's taught me. But if you want to know my position on issues, ask me and I'll tell you. I think the low point of this race was when my opponent and their family decided to make religion an issue in this campaign -- brought it out, attacked me for it. I think that's a mistake. I think the time has passed for that. John Kennedy was the one who fought that battle; let that battle live for all of us of all faiths.</p>
        <p>KENNEDY I would agree with Mr. Romney that religion has no place in this campaign. And the best way to make sure that it doesn't is not to talk any further about it, and I don't intend to do so.</p>
        <p>On the question of the choice issue, I have supported Roe v. Wade. I am pro-choice; my opponent is multiple choice.</p>
        <p>I have not only introduced the freedom-of-choice legislation but I have fought -- wrote and saw successfully passed -- the clinic access bill that will permit women to be able to practice their constitutional rights in selection of abortion. And I have also led the fight against judges in the Supreme Court of the United States that refuse to permit a woman's right to choose.  THE 1994 CAMPAIGN</p>
