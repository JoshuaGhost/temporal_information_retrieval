        <p>Kmart Opening in the Bronx, And Brooklyn May Be Next</p>
        <p>Kmart, the national discount retailer best known for its blue-light specials, plans to open its first store in the Bronx and is considering two locations in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The Bronx store, a 128,000-square-foot mega-store, is under construction at 300 Baychester Avenue near Co-Op City and is to open on Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving, according to Michelle DeLand, a spokeswoman for Kmart.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, Ms. DeLand said, Kmart is looking around Bensonhurst and also at a site in Park Slope. Kmart has stores in Queens and Staten Island.  And the Rest Is History: Landmark Makes a 'Fantastic' Rug Showroom</p>
        <p>The New York Bank for Savings building, the striking, copper-domed landmark on the northwest corner of Eighth Avenue and 14th Street, has been empty since 1981, when a bank merger closed it. Yesterday, after a two-year renovation, Central Carpet opened its second store at the location. The building, bought by Central Carpet in 1992, was built in 1896 and designated a historical landmark, for its interior and exterior, in 1988.</p>
        <p>"It was love at first sight," said Scott Newborn, the general manager. "As you do with a home, there are times when you walk in and you see the furnishing in the space. We instantly pictured it as this fantastic showroom."</p>
        <p>The architects, Scarano, Englert &amp; Norton, added a free-standing mezzanine -- avoiding the antique marble walls -- that overlooks the original banking hall. The design incorporated the central Corinthian columns.</p>
        <p>Central Carpet plans to display up to 15,000 carpets in the store, making it one of the largest showrooms in the city. Imax in the Evening, or Afternoon, As 3-D Comes to Lincoln Center</p>
        <p>Workers are completing the Sony Theaters Lincoln Square complex, a 12-screen movie multiplex that features the world's largest 3-D movie screen, an 80-by-100-foot sheet of vinyl equivalent in height to an eight-story building. The screen will show movies shot with the Imax system, which uses extra-large film frames (up to 10 times the size of standard 35-millimeter film) to create very clear images and depth of field.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the complex is the 900-seat Loews auditorium. With a crystal chandelier, oversized seats and balcony seating, it is designed to evoke the spirit of the original Loews Theater, a 1930's movie house on West 72d Street. It was demolished in 1961. The Lincoln Square complex, at Broadway and 67th Street, is to open in mid-November.</p>
