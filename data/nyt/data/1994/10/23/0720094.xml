        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>New York, not Boston, is the nation's cultural capital. You'd never know it from watching the Public Broadcasting Service. William F. Baker, president of WNET-Channel 13, New York's public television affiliate, wants to put the station's financial house in order (arts pages, Oct. 18). But what is being saved?</p>
        <p>New York's PBS station should be a beacon, a national center of production and an originator of programming for PBS. It is, alas, the opposite. And downsizing will make the situation worse.</p>
        <p>"Money follows art," Joseph Papp used to say. And it did: the New York Public Theater impresario was not afraid to run deficits. He insisted to corporations and New York City that his Shakespeare Festival was as necessary to the city's life as public libraries and the Fire Department.</p>
        <p>He built his castles in the air. The money came. Landmark productions made his theater, at its height, the most important in the country (and for a while the richest).</p>
        <p>It is a scandal to see WNET, surrounded by rich cultural resources, withering away to nothing more than another local PBS affiliate. Boldness and vision could make it what it should be: the most important PBS affiliate in the country because of the original programming that it creates.  CHARLES E. MC CARRY  New York, Oct. 19, 1994</p>
