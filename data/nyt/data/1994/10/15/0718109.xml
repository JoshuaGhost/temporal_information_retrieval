        <p>Giants linebacker Carlton Bailey said he planned on bringing some aspirin to the game. Linebacker Corey Miller joked that he would wear extra padding in his helmet. No, they are not preparing to go on the world's fastest roller coaster. Actually, that would be easy compared to what the Giants' defense must do on Sunday.</p>
        <p>It must stop Los Angeles Rams running back Jerome Bettis, the 250-pound bruiser who regularly runs over linebackers for breakfast. Indeed, it might be easier tackling a roller coaster.</p>
        <p>If Bettis is able to run loose among the Giants, bouncing off players the way a bowling ball bounces off pins, then it will be a long afternoon for New York at Anaheim Stadium. The Giants must do what few other teams have done to the former Notre Dame star: shut him down.</p>
        <p>"He's a big back," Bailey said today, "and if you don't come at him with everything, he'll hurt you."</p>
        <p>Bettis is only in his second year but already he is rewriting Rams records as Coach Chuck Knox -- otherwise known as Ground Chuck -- has yet another back who can consistently rush for 1,000 yards a season. Bettis had 1,429 yards in his rookie year, and after opening this season with 52 yards against Arizona, he proceeded to chalk up four consecutive 100-yard games, the most by a Ram since Eric Dickerson rushed for a club-record six straight in 1984.</p>
        <p>The Rams aren't the only people who notice what Bettis is doing. Like the Giants' Rodney Hampton, he has an 'X' on his back as opposing teams stack eight and nine men on the line of scrimmage. "I think toward the end of last year I was pretty much a marked man," Bettis said. "It hasn't changed."</p>
        <p>It's easy to understand why. He is the National Football League's second-leading rusher with 572 yards. And despite the armies set up on the line of scrimmage to stop him, Bettis still manages to get free. The Giants only hope he doesn't get free very much against them. Kicking a Job Away?</p>
        <p>Giants punter Mike Horan has been struggling. He is in a definite slump, maybe one of the worst of his career. And if he doesn't improve soon, the Giants may have no choice but to let him go.</p>
        <p>The Giants are 24th in the league with a net punt average of 34.6 yards. Last week against Minnesota, Horan struggled. To be fair to him, he was kicking into the wind for most of the night. But he has not kicked well in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>"He's struggled more than I've ever seen him," said Coach Dan Reeves.</p>
        <p>Speaking of punting, the former Giant Sean Landeta, now with the Rams, bruised his shoulder last week trying to make a tackle. He should be fine for the Giants game. The Losses Last</p>
        <p>When Giants quarterback Dave Brown was in college and he hit a few bumps in the road, as he is doing now, he got over them a lot quicker than he does as a Giant. But in the pros when people play football for a living and losing a game is like losing your dog, it takes longer to get over the losses. This is something the young quarterback now realizes.</p>
        <p>"In high school or college if you lose a game, you are disappointed for the night then you can go on," said Brown. "These last two weeks have been kind of torture. When you come here and you want to win so badly and you are working so hard and watching film and doing the things that you have to do -- when you lose, you have to kind of look deep down and do a little more.</p>
        <p>"I think this whole offense is kind of looking at themselves, watching more film and trying to get off on the right track." Hampton Back in Stride</p>
        <p>The one bright spot for the Giants is that running back Rodney Hampton, who missed two games with back and kidney injuries, looks as if he is back in sync. All week during practice he ran hard and cut well and was doing the things that landed him in the Pro Bowl last season.</p>
        <p>Against the Vikings, Hampton looked a little sluggish and didn't hit holes with the explosion he usually does. Now it seems that Hampton is himself again.</p>
        <p>"You always miss a runner because it's timing and the vision," said Reeves. "It's just like in a game where he gets into a rhythm. You get in a rhythm by weeks, too, by running plays and seeing things and reacting to them and the players realizing, too, in running the plays constantly that he's used to." Tough, for Openers</p>
        <p>The Giants' defense has not surrendered a touchdown on an opponents' opening drive in 27 games. The last time was against the Denver Broncos in 1992. That team was coached by -- guess who -- Dan Reeves . . . This may be the healthiest the Giants have been all season. On the other hand, the Rams are pretty beat up. . . . Earl Leggett, the Giants' defensive line coach, was on the Rams' roster in 1966. . . . Despite Dave Brown's 7 interceptions, the Giants still have a turnover ratio of plus 2 (11 takeaways, 9 turnovers), which ties them for fifth in the conference.  PRO FOOTBALL: GIANTS NOTEBOOK</p>
