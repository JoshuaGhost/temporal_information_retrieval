        <p>Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate challenging Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, was asked in one of their debates what his position was on health care.</p>
        <p>"I want universal coverage," he replied. And, he said, Americans should be able to move without losing their insurance and should not be excluded because of pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
        <p>"But I am not in favor of a program that adds to our taxes or deficit," he said, adding that he also opposed employer mandates.</p>
        <p>In other words, he favored covering the 39 million Americans who are not now insured and guaranteeing lifetime coverage for everyone -- all without costing the taxpayers or anyone else a penny.</p>
        <p>Offering voters a free lunch is a familiar tactic in American politics, but it has never been used more brazenly than in this Congressional election. Mr. Romney is by no means an extreme example.</p>
        <p>Newt Gingrich, the putative Speaker-to-be, set the tone with the "contract" that he had Republican candidates for the House flourish. They undertook to cut taxes, increase defense spending -- and pass a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Contractual voodoo.</p>
        <p>The distinctive feature of this year's free-lunch campaign is that it is accompanied by a heavy dose of hate. Republicans are trying, evidently with a good deal of success, to tap into the public's anger at politicians and government itself.</p>
        <p>The anti-government message has been carried to its logical conclusion by Michael Huffington, who opposes Senator Dianne Feinstein in California. Tasked with not doing much in his one term in the House, Mr. Huffington said he was proud of that:</p>
        <p>"I did not go to Washington to pass a lot of new legislation. For the past 200 years, that's all they have been doing."</p>
        <p>(We are indebted to Linda Douglass of the "CBS Evening News" for her report that preserved Mr. Huffington's words for history.)</p>
        <p>The 1994 campaign, nasty and vacuous at the same time, raises puzzling questions. Why are the voters so angry? Why is it a successful tactic for candidates to denounce Washington and all its works while promising to go there and deliver something for nothing?</p>
        <p>The best answer I have seen comes from abroad. It is in the current issue of The Economist of London, in a leading article headed, "Voters, blame thyselves."</p>
        <p>America is not in the terrible state that public anger would suggest, The Economist says. Crime rates are actually falling. "Census figures show that Americans on average are healthier and better educated than ever before and that, even allowing for inflation, disposable income is rising. Indeed, the economy is roaring away." Then why the angst?</p>
        <p>"The reason seems to be that Americans, despite their patent good fortune when compared with most other people, feel deeply insecure. The job market is changing in swift and unpredictable ways, ways they are often not equipped for.  They are no longer sure that even two incomes can maintain their standard of living. Many of them, because of the recent messy death of health-care reform, must still dread the expense of falling ill."</p>
        <p>But there is more: a paradox that I think The Economist correctly identifies as a key to the current American mood.</p>
        <p>"Americans rail against their Government's weakness, paralysis, venality, profligacy. Yet it is citizens who give their money and time to insure that no changes can be made that are at the expense of their subsidy, their Social Security check, their tax break; it is mostly the voters' money that bribes the politicians; it is voters who insist that more needs to be done, but with lower taxes and without killing any existing programs.</p>
        <p>"It is not, in other words, the work of some unholy Messrs. Big. It is the result of actions by ordinary voters, organized in their associations of pensioners, miners, farmers and thousands more."</p>
        <p>Yes, the Government we have is the one we asked for. If we are ashamed of our creation, self-examination would be a wiser remedy than anger. At the least we should be prepared to answer the political con artists as in the old song:</p>
        <p>"There'll be pie in the sky by and by."</p>
        <p>"It's a lie."</p>
