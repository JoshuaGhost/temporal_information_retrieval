        <p>Wooden sailing ships, steel steamships, destroyers, frigates, icebreakers, ferries, freighters and tankers have been launched at the MIL-Davie shipyard here since Allison Davie founded the company in 1829. But now the future is uncertain for the last big shipyard in Quebec.</p>
        <p>A Canadian Navy destroyer, the Huron, is getting an electronic overhaul, one of the yard's last big contracts. When the Huron sails for sea trials at the end of November, employment will plummet to 300 from the current 1,200, already well below the 2,250 workers employed at the end of last year and the 3,200 at the end of 1992. Without new work, shipbuilding here could go the way of buggy whip  making.</p>
        <p>Like many shipyards in North America, MIL-Davie, which is owned by the Province of Quebec, has been desperately trying to convert from military to civilian operations. It has drawn up plans to fill a niche market of 40,000- to  70,000-ton bulk carriers and tankers. Two American yards, Newport News in Virginia and Avondale in Louisiana, are working on similar concepts.</p>
        <p>But while military orders have dried up, the commercial shipbuilding industry has yet to see any sharp pickup in demand.</p>
        <p>And compounding the competitive pressure is an increase in civilian shipbuilding capacity in South Korea, Russia, other former Soviet republics and  Poland.</p>
        <p>Guy C. Veronneau, MIL-Davie's president and chief executive, readily acknowledges that he is uneasy about the yard's future -- though if it can just  survive the next few years, he said, better times are ahead, as the many old tankers and freighters now in service finally give out.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, his workers feel the pressure in this town just half a dozen miles down the St. Lawrence River from the provincial capital, Quebec.</p>
        <p>Henri Pelletier, a 40-year-old who has worked here for 24 years as a marine  mechanic, seemed oblivious to the surrounding hills blazing with autumn colors.  Among his co-workers there is "much fear," he said, adding that he and his wife  worry about what kind of Christmas their children will enjoy, if new business is not found for the shipyard.</p>
        <p>Enter the newly elected provincial government under the separatist Parti Quebecois.</p>
        <p>Many Quebecers who voted for the Parti Quebecois see MIL-Davie, with its nearly blank order book and looming layoffs, as a symbol of a failed federalism.</p>
        <p>"The federal Government could have done something earlier," said Jean Garon, who represents Lauzon in the Quebec Assembly, to which he was recently re-elected with 83 percent of the vote. "But it gave orders to New Brunswick and Newfoundland, even as two other shipbuilders in Quebec had to shut down."</p>
        <p>The new provincial government, he pledged, "will maintain this shipyard as a going concern." The party's leader and Quebec's new Premier, Jacques Parizeau, said something similar when he campaigned a few weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Yet in this era of rocketing government debt and tight budgets, the question is just how much government can do.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garon wants Ottawa to spend $100 million (United States) on a new ferry  from Prince Edward Island to Magdalen Island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The existing ferry is 30 years old.</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, the federal Government should order a prototype for a  new fleet of Navy supply vessels known as Smart ships (for strategic multi-role  aid replenishment transport), which cost about $150 million each. Such a fleet could swiftly deploy a battalion of peacekeepers to a foreign crisis spot and provide takeoff and landing sites for helicopters, he said.</p>
        <p>And if the federal Government in Ottawa balks, Mr. Garon said Quebec itself  should order a ferry and use it to open a new provincial service from the tip of the Gaspe Peninsula to Magdalen.</p>
        <p>Both Gaspe and Magdalen are part of Quebec. Because the existing Prince Edward Island-Magdalen service is inter-provincial, it comes under federal jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>With MIL-Davie's high visibility in Quebec, many analysts expect the Parti Quebecois to stick by its campaign pledge to save the yard. Pierre Fortin, an economist at the University of Quebec at Montreal, said that the spending on a Gaspe-Magdalen ferry could be easily defended as an investment.</p>
        <p>There is still a possibility that the federal Government could order a replacement ferry from Lauzon because of the age of the existing ship. Ottawa faces a difficult choice, however, because another big shipyard, Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., owned by the Irving family of New Brunswick, would also like  to get the business. Saint John now has more navy contracts than Lauzon does.</p>
        <p>Mr. Veronneau, the head of MIL-Davie, insists that the yard is proposing valid projects, not white elephants. The Smart ships and the ferry, he said, would be "useful for the federal Government."</p>
        <p>Even though MIL-Davie is government-owned, Mr. Veronneau said, his mandate is to run it "as a private and profitable company." Indeed, he said, should the  shipbuilding industry recover, the government would sell the company to investors. "The Quebec government," he asserted, "has no business in shipbuilding."</p>
        <p>For now, projects like the ferry and naval transports are needed to carry MIL-Davie until the expected surge of new commercial orders to replace aging cargo vessels and tankers.</p>
        <p>Nearly half the tankers on the high seas are at least 15 years old, and of tankers exceeding 200,000 tons, 70 percent are in that category. The useful life of a ship is 22 years. In the next 10 years, many analysts say, half the world fleet of tankers may have to be replaced. Freighters have a similar age profile.</p>
        <p>"People are surprised that so many ships have stayed operational for so long," said Stuart Nicoll, deputy editor of Lloyd's Shipping Economist of London, a monthly magazine covering the shipping market. "A phenomenal amount of shipbuilding will be needed. The debate is over when the surge will take place. Some say two to three years, others say four to five."</p>
        <p>Will the Quebec yard be competitive? Yes, insists Mr. Veronneau, a 57-year-old former international marketing vice president for the transport conglomerate Bombardier Inc., which is based in Montreal.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, he noted, Japan and Germany were paying lower wages. Today Germany's wages are higher than Canada's, and Japan's are about the same. South  Korea still has an advantage, but the gap is closing, with South Korea's wages only about 25 percent below Quebec's. At MIL-Davie, average pay is about $13.30  (United States) an hour.</p>
        <p>"There should be a lot of room for a lot of people," he commented in an office looking out on huge dockside cranes that stand mostly idle. "You don't have to be No. 1. There are 300 shipyards in the world, and you only need to be  in the first third."</p>
