        <p>AKBAR * (212) 838-1717; 475 Park Avenue, near 58th Street; $$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>Ornately designed with pilasters, dining alcoves and a stained-glass ceiling, Akbar is a reliable spot for the refined and highly seasoned Mogul cuisine of Northern India. Among starters are the mildly peppery mulligatawny soup; papri chat, puffed crackers served with cubed potatoes in an invigorating tamarind-yogurt sauce, and tasty little potato-bound vegetable patties called samosas. Enticing main courses include the tandoor-roasted marinated chicken and moist chicken ginger kebabs. Other options are vindaloo of lamb, a spicy dish with cinnamon and ginger, and biryani, the house special, a traditional basmati rice dish that combines chicken, saffron and other spices. Akbar has a nice selection of well-prepared vegetarian dishes including bhurta (mashed, garlicky eggplant) and matter paneer (cubes of fresh cheese with fresh peas in hot sauce). (Review: 3/19/93)  BRASSERIE *  (212) 751-4840; 100 East 53d Street; $$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>Open around the clock, Brasserie has a sweeping, comfortable main dining room with a giant U-shaped eating bar in the center and a smaller room off to the side. Start with snails in a garlic-herb butter; mixed greens topped with warm goat cheese; crab cakes with a white butter sauce, or vegetable terrine with a parsley coulis. For entrees there are duck confit with stewed beans and tomatoes; choucroute a l'Alsacienne, a dish combining smoked meats, sauerkraut, wine and potatoes; grilled marinated chicken with a warm lime and lemon-grass vinaigrette; grilled lamb chops with ratatouille, and grilled Black Angus steak served with herbed butter and frites. (Review: 6/7/91; article: 10/30/92)  LE COLONIAL **  (212) 752-0808; 149 East 57th Street; $$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>Ceiling fans stirring the air, potted palms, green shutters mounted on the walls and subdued lighting -- there's an exotic tropical feel at this new Vietnamese restaurant. Sprightly starters on the current menu include goi cuon, lettuce, shrimp, bean sprouts, skinny slivers of rice noodle and herbs wrapped in sheets of rice paper, served with an aromatic peanut sauce on the side; delicately fried spring rolls, and goi bo, a spicy beef salad with lemon grass, basil and chili. Among entrees are sauteed shrimp in a sauce of curried coconut with eggplant; roast duck marinated in ginger and served with a tamarind sauce; grilled spiced beef brochette set over angel hair pasta, and crispy whole snapper with a light and spicy citrus sauce. (Review: 4/1/94)  ROSA MEXICANO ** (212) 753-7407; 1063 First Avenue, at 58th Street; $$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>One of the few authentic Mexican restaurants in town, Rosa Mexicano is largely the creation of Josephina Howard, the chef and co-owner, who is a diligent researcher of Mexican regional cooking. Her menu is relatively light, emphasizing grilled meats and fish as well as casseroles seasoned with mole sauces, various chili combinations and herbs. A fine way to begin is with the excellent chunky guacamole with lemon and coriander, prepared at tableside to your heat specification. Other starters include sauteed oysters in a marinade of spiced chilies and shrimp Nayaril, sauteed and served cold marinated in a mustard and chile vinaigrette. Also recommended are the tablas, or short ribs of beef marinated in beer and lemon, then grilled over an open fire and the posole, an earthy stew combining pork, chicken, hominy, coriander and lime and served with assorted condiments. (Review: 5/28/93)  SOLERA ** (212) 644-1166; 216 East 53d Street; $$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>This comely Iberian spot combines comfort and congeniality with some of the best Spanish fare in the city.  Solera has a colorful tiled tapas bar in the front and a sunny glass-enclosed private room in the back seating 20.  The tapas bar has Spanish tortillas made with golden cubed potatoes, tasty white beans and strips of salchichon (a dried chorizo made with pork and beef); sparkling fresh head cheese with red onions; big marinated green olives, and grilled shrimp with garlic. Another way to start is with a pheasant and guinea hen terrine with morels, or spicy fried calamari with basil aioli. Among main courses are grilled salmon set over a grilled vegetable puree with stuffed eggplant; grilled grouper with a red pepper coulis and black olive polenta, and roasted duck breast with lemon and a spiced peach and rhubarb compote. (Review: 6/21/91; revisited: 6/23/94)  TATOU ** (212) 753-1144; 151 East 50th Street; $$$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>This former cabaret is a handsome supper club with a 30-foot-high ceiling and ornate balcony. A massive chandelier hangs from the center, and faux antique windows run from floor to ceiling. In this nightclub setting, with live music nightly, Scott Cohen, formerly of La Reserve, turns out some beguiling regional American fare. Current starters include crab ravioli in a smoky tomato sauce with braised fennel; a terrific tortilla soup with strands of chicken and tortillas, and smoked salmon served with dill pancakes, creme fraiche and salmon caviar. Among entrees are roasted honey-mustard-marinated salmon drizzled with a basil vinaigrette; grilled Arctic char with a roasted corn vinaigrette, wild mushrooms and brown rice, and broiled chicken with mushroom sauce, sweet potato and collard greens. (Review: 10/4/91; article 1/17/92)  ZARELA ** (212) 644-6740; 953 Second Avenue, near 51st Street; $$; American Express, Diner's Club, Carte Blanche</p>
        <p>At this superior Mexican restaurant, named after its exuberant owner, Zarela Martinez, every night is a party. The place is festooned with colorful paper cutouts. Antique Mexican masks decorate the downstairs dining room; upstairs, the walls are lined with banquettes covered in bright fabric. As for the food, the kitchen turns out some of the most authentic and spirited Mexican dishes around. For starters there are chicken enchiladas with a pumpkin seed sauce; red-snapper hash cooked with tomato, scallions, jalapeno and spices, and guacamole. Among main courses are roast marinated pork with a tomato, onion and chipotle chilies sauce; grilled marinated skirt steak with salsa and guacamole, and grill-smoked salmon served with a chipotle mayonnaise and cucumber relish.

        <p>Stylish Indian  DAWAT ** (212) 355-7555; 210 East 58th Street; $$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>Dawat is one of the more stylish and innovative Indian restaurants in Manhattan. Among the best appetizers are shami kebab, disks of ground lamb with mint, and dahi aloo poori, wafers tossed with potato cubes and chickpeas in yogurt. Excellent main courses include shrimp with coconut milk flavored with mustard seeds, curry and tamarind (konju pappaas); salmon fillet with coriander chutney, steamed in a banana leaf, and chicken badami, in a creamy sauce of ground almonds.
