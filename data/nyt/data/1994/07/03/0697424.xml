        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thank you for "Rebelling Against Disney" (editorial, June 19), on the proposed Disney theme park in Virginia. It sometimes seems there is no concern for our historic heritage.</p>
        <p>I was especially interested in your "little history lesson" about Ulysses S. Grant and the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. Nathaniel Pitt Langford, my great-granduncle, was a member of the Washburn Expedition in 1870 that explored the Yellowstone area that became the first national park.</p>
        <p>He left a diary in which he told of seeing water thrown high into the air from what would be called a geyser. He was especially impressed by one that did not erupt constantly, but once every hour! He urged President Grant to set this area aside for the use of the people and not let it become a commercial venture.</p>
        <p>He was among those instrumental in establishing the National Park Service and was named Yellowstone's first superintendent. A ranger told me he was known as National Park Langford. JOHN M. ALDEN Staatsburg, N.Y., June 21, 1994</p>
