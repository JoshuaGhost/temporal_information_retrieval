        <p>There is no question that Rodney Hampton is a leader, but you will never see him stand up in the middle of the Giants' locker room to give a George Patton-like speech. Chances are he will sit quietly by his locker nibbling on a Snickers bar, let the other guys do the talking, then go out and stampede for 150 yards. So when Hampton today guaranteed that the Giants would make the playoffs, it was an unusually bold statement for someone who is so quiet.</p>
        <p>Quiet but powerful. And it is clear that Hampton, the heart and soul of New York's running game, has quietly become one of the team's most respected players. That might explain the bold prediction. Bold because many people expect the Giants to miss the playoffs because of the loss of so many key players, such as Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, and 75 percent of the starting secondary. Hampton dismissed the doomsayers. His thoughts? The Giants will get in -- count on it. 'We Believe in Ourselves'</p>
        <p>"I heard people say we weren't going to make the playoffs last year," Hampton said. "Then before you know, we were 3-0 and then people were saying we hadn't played anybody. Then we went to the playoffs. I think the same thing will happen this year. We'll get there. People can doubt us if they want to, but we believe in ourselves and we'll be in the playoffs.</p>

        <p>There is no question that Rodney Hampton is a leader, but you will never see him stand up in the middle of the Giants' locker room to give a George Patton-like speech. Chances are he will sit quietly by his locker nibbling on a Snickers bar, let the other guys do the talking, then go out and stampede for 150 yards. So when Hampton today guaranteed that the Giants would make the playoffs, it was an unusually bold statement for someone who is so quiet.</p>
        <p>Quiet but powerful. And it is clear that Hampton, the heart and soul of New York's running game, has quietly become one of the team's most respected players. That might explain the bold prediction. Bold because many people expect the Giants to miss the playoffs because of the loss of so many key players, such as Phil Simms and Lawrence Taylor, and 75 percent of the starting secondary. Hampton dismissed the doomsayers. His thoughts? The Giants will get in -- count on it. 'We Believe in Ourselves'</p>
        <p>"I heard people say we weren't going to make the playoffs last year," Hampton said. "Then before you know, we were 3-0 and then people were saying we hadn't played anybody. Then we went to the playoffs. I think the same thing will happen this year. We'll get there. People can doubt us if they want to, but we believe in ourselves and we'll be in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>"Oh, yeah, I guarantee it. That's our goal. That's the first and most important goal. People may not think we have the talent to do it, but we do. We'll get there. If we play hard like we did last year, play as a team, then we will get in the playoffs. And I know these guys, everyone will play hard because they want to play hard and because Coach Reeves demands that we play hard."</p>
        <p>Coach Dan Reeves believes a good work ethic that includes a strong mental presence -- make as few mistakes as possible -- can often carry a team far, even if the talent isn't always there. Last year, Reeves did a masterly job of getting the most out of the Giants he could. He will have to do even better with this version and, depending on who you speak to, it all begins with Hampton and the running game.</p>
        <p>Neither Hampton nor the coaches will say publicly that the burden has increased two-fold on their 230 pound, Pro Bowl back. But clearly it has. The team has two unproven quarterbacks, so the running game will become much more important. There is also talk of shortening the passing game somewhat, and throwing to the backs more.</p>
        <p>Whatever the Giants do, one thing is certain: Hampton will get the ball. He is one of the most powerful backs in the league, one of the top five when it comes to combining power, pure speed and quick feet. Now in his fifth year, Hampton is the only Giants player to rush for 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons (1991-1993). He rushed for 1,077 yards last year despite missing four games because of arthroscopic surgery on his left knee. Another 1,000-Yard Season?</p>
        <p>Is a 1,000 yard season likely again this year? "I really don't think too much about it," he said. "Hopefully I can get over that hump again this season. My main thing this season is trying to stay healthy, but sometimes you can't control what happens."</p>
        <p>Though Hampton says he was in just as good shape at the beginning of camp last year, many around him disagree, saying Hampton showed up this year in even better condition. George Sefcik. the running backs coach, is one of those people. Hampton said he did hit the weights more this time around and spent more time on the track and in the swimming pool.</p>
        <p>"I know what it takes to get ready," Hampton said. "I was ready last year and I'm ready this year." Casual at Training Camp</p>
        <p>Hampton has always had a kind of casual approach to training camp. He doesn't like to leave it all at Florham Park and then have little left for the season. When the real season begins, he is a monster. During the first week of camp, some of the rookie backs were at first less than impressed, saying that they couldn't believe this guy was the Rodney Hampton. Then second-year fullback Kenyon Rasheed set things straight.</p>
        <p>"I told them I thought the same thing when I was a rookie," said Rasheed. "But then I said wait until the season starts. You can't believe it's the same guy."</p>
        <p>It is. And if Hampton's guarantee comes true, he will have another chance to show what he can do -- in the playoffs. EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The preseason game between the Giants and Miami on Saturday night at Giants Stadium will be played without Dolphins quarterback DAN MARINO, who does not want to take a chance in an exhibition with his surgically repaired Achilles' tendon. Also out for the Dolphins are running back TERRY KIRBY (knee) and defensive back TROY VINCENT (knee).</p>
