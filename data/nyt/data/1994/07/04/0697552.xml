        <p>The Dinkins administration vastly overstated the success of its minority contracting program, a recent series of articles in The Times has revealed.

        <p>The Dinkins administration vastly overstated the success of its minority contracting program, a recent series of articles in The Times has revealed. Some companies that won contracts by claiming female or minority ownership may actually be owned by men or whites -- facts that city officials could have ascertained if they had not been so cavalier in their investigations. Misleading bookkeeping also let the administration make exaggerated claims about the number of contracts going to women and minorities -- claims Mr. Dinkins used in his mayoral campaign.</p>
        <p>Such flim-flam is hard to avoid in municipal contracting, especially in affirmative-action programs. The reason is basic: money and politics are involved. But the difficulties of creating effective affirmative-action programs is no excuse to give up, as Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has, in effect, done.</p>
        <p>The Mayor, who called the Dinkins program "bad social policy" during the mayoral campaign, began dismantling it soon after he took office. He abandoned the Dinkins practice of awarding contracts to qualified minority- or women-owned companies even if they bid up to 10 percent higher than the lowest bidder. Now he has dropped the other key feature of the program -- its long-term goal of awarding 20 percent of all city contracts to such companies.</p>
        <p>Randy Mastro, Mayor Giuliani's chief of staff, says other steps will be taken to expand dramatically the chances for minority- and women-owned businesses to compete for contracts. These businesses will be carefully certified as minority- or women-owned by the Department of Business Services. They will then be given access to a city computer system listing prospective contracts, enabling them to know about and bid on many more contracts than in the past.</p>
        <p>These steps, while useful, are too limited. Absent a stated goal, where is the city's incentive to promote the awarding of contracts to companies owned by women and minorities? Affirmative-action programs, despite the problems that often arise, are proven mechanisms for giving minority groups a chance to enter fields of work previously closed to them.</p>
        <p>If the Mayor wanted to design an effective minority contracting program with safeguards against abuse, surely he could. Few are better equipped to do so than Mr. Giuliani, a former Federal prosecutor with strong law-and-order credentials. But Mr. Giuliani remains opposed to the goals and set-asides of many affirmative-action programs. It is disappointing that he chooses to duck a challenge that could no doubt be met if the political will existed to do so.</p>
