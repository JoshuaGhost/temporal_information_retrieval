        <p>The Philadelphia Eagles filled a void in the defensive backfield today by signing the veteran free-agent safety Greg Jackson to two one-year contracts. Financial terms weren't disclosed. Jackson was paid $650,000 last season with the Giants.</p>
        <p>Jackson, 27, played for the Giants for the past five seasons. A third-round pick out of L.S.U. in 1989, he started 59 games, amassing 311 tackles and 14 interceptions.</p>

        <p>The Philadelphia Eagles filled a void in the defensive backfield today by signing the veteran free-agent safety Greg Jackson to two one-year contracts. Financial terms weren't disclosed. Jackson was paid $650,000 last season with the Giants.</p>
        <p>Jackson, 27, played for the Giants for the past five seasons. A third-round pick out of L.S.U. in 1989, he started 59 games, amassing 311 tackles and 14 interceptions.</p>
        <p>Considering our situation, safety is an area where we felt we needed some help, we're doing all that we can to upgrade the safety positions," Eagles Coach Rich Kotite said. "Greg has been a solid starter with the Giants and he's a guy  who should be able to come in here and help us."</p>
        <p>Jackson, a 6-foot-1-inch, 210-pound native of Miami, started 16 regular-season and two post-season games at free safety for New York last season and tied for the team lead with four interceptions.</p>
        <p>"Greg's a young, proven veteran who can play either safety spot if he has to. He's a big hitter who also brings a lot of poise and leadership to the ball club," Kotite said.</p>
