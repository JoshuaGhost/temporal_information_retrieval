      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Supreme Court's approval of a buffer zone keeping anti-abortion demonstrators a safe distance from a Florida abortion clinic is a victory for law and order over the disruptive zealots of Operation Rescue. Writing for a 6-to-3 majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist provided a model for judges trying to preserve the rights of a clinic's patients and staff to go about their business, unimpeded. He did so without disturbing the free speech rights of abortion opponents who are content to wage their protests peacefully.</p>
        <p>The Chief Justice, who has long been personally opposed to abortion rights, nevertheless had no trouble drawing the line against illegal interference with those rights. He upheld key parts of a lower court injunction against protesters who intimidated and threatened a clinic in Melbourne, Fla. That included approving a 36-foot buffer zone to let patients and staff move in and out of the clinic freely. But Chief Justice Rehnquist struck down stricter restraints, including a ban on protesters' trying to speak to patients within 300 feet of the clinic, as excessively curbing rights of free speech.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court's approval of a buffer zone keeping anti-abortion demonstrators a safe distance from a Florida abortion clinic is a victory for law and order over the disruptive zealots of Operation Rescue. Writing for a 6-to-3 majority, Chief Justice William Rehnquist provided a model for judges trying to preserve the rights of a clinic's patients and staff to go about their business, unimpeded. He did so without disturbing the free speech rights of abortion opponents who are content to wage their protests peacefully.</p>
        <p>The Chief Justice, who has long been personally opposed to abortion rights, nevertheless had no trouble drawing the line against illegal interference with those rights. He upheld key parts of a lower court injunction against protesters who intimidated and threatened a clinic in Melbourne, Fla. That included approving a 36-foot buffer zone to let patients and staff move in and out of the clinic freely. But Chief Justice Rehnquist struck down stricter restraints, including a ban on protesters' trying to speak to patients within 300 feet of the clinic, as excessively curbing rights of free speech.</p>
        <p>The calmly worded opinion by the Chief Justice rejected a dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, who was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Anthony Kennedy. They claimed that abortion opponents had been singled out for speech suppression. Mr. Rehnquist replied simply that Operation Rescue people had been  the only parties who had threatened to violate local law, which was itself evenhanded in prohibiting breaches of the peace regardless of the motives of the protesters.</p>
        <p>The Court's decision gives timely guidance to judges implementing a new Federal law safeguarding clinics. That law provides heavy penalties for clinic rioters and allows state and Federal attorneys to seek injunctions to forestall  violence.</p>
        <p>Operation Rescue and its violence-prone allies are hollering persecution, but they are only being asked to observe the rules that demonstrators have always been required to obey: express your opinion, but pay the price of prosecution and court injunction if your trespass infringes the rights of others.</p>
