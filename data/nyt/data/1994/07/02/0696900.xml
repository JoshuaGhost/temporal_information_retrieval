        <p>As many as one in four homes in the United States tuned in to the opening day of O. J. Simpson's court hearing, a television analyst said yesterday.</p>
        <p>"That would be supplemented, of course, by a significant out-of-home audience, since it ran in the lunch hour for most of the country," said David Poltrack, an audience researcher for CBS.</p>
        <p>ABC, CBS and NBC pre-empted their regular programs for live coverage on Thursday, earning a combined rating of 16.6 and a 49 audience share for the period from noon to 3 P.M. Eastern time in the 31 markets covered by the overnight report of the Nielsen rating service.</p>

        <p>As many as one in four homes in the United States tuned in to the opening day of O. J. Simpson's court hearing, a television analyst said yesterday.</p>
        <p>"That would be supplemented, of course, by a significant out-of-home audience, since it ran in the lunch hour for most of the country," said David Poltrack, an audience researcher for CBS.</p>
        <p>ABC, CBS and NBC pre-empted their regular programs for live coverage on Thursday, earning a combined rating of 16.6 and a 49 audience share for the period from noon to 3 P.M. Eastern time in the 31 markets covered by the overnight report of the Nielsen rating service.</p>
        <p>A single ratings point in the 31 markets equals 496,703 households; the share is the percentage of sets in use that are tuned in to a certain program.</p>
        <p>"Over the course of those three hours, we figure that somewhere between 20 to 25 percent of all U.S. homes tuned in for some coverage," Mr. Poltrack said.</p>
        <p>He called the ratings "significant, but not overwhelming," adding that the figures represented a 24 percent increase in network viewing over the corresponding day and time last week.</p>
        <p>For the same three-hour period, CNN had a 3.4 average rating, meaning it was  watched in about 2.1 million homes.</p>
