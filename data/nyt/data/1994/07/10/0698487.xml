        <p>Proposed addendum to city fact sheets. Place after Tallest Building. Greatest Known Height From Which Cat Has Fallen and Survived: 46 Floors. Set: June 25, 1994, by Leo, of Manhattan Plaza off Tenth Avenue. Details: Owner, Kirk Romero, leaves apartment at 3 A.M. to walk puppy, leaving door to terrace open. Owner returns, hunts for cat; finally found in planter at base of building. Dr. Mary Suchowiecki at Animal Medical Center finds injury common in high falls: pneumothorax, air forced out of lungs and into lung cavity. Footnote: Cats achieve terminal velocity (60 m.p.h., half that of humans) after 7 to 10 stories, so the impact is never greater than that. Experts believe cats relax at that speed, lessening impact trauma. Epilogue: "He's getting back to his own self," Mr. Romero says. "He wants to go back on the balcony."</p>
