        <p>Baby's Day Out  Lara Flynn Boyle, Brian Haley, Joe Mantegna Directed by Patrick Read Johnson PG 90 minutes</p>
        <p>Baby Bink, the 9-month-old child of a wealthy, self-absorbed couple, is kidnapped by three hoods posing as photographers. But Bink escapes through an open window while one of the stooges is sleeping. Parents may find the premise of a baby crawling through the streets of Chicago distinctly unfunny; children, however, may see it as "Home Alone" in diapers. Bink, a Rasputin in rompers, is impervious to harm. As he crawls past speeding cars and heedless shoppers, the film underscores the invisibility of children in our culture. But even 4-year-olds will spot the hole in this plot: a city of hapless adults couldn't help noticing a baby this cute. VIOLENCE Endless, repetitive bone-crunching wounds are inflicted on the bad guys. It looks too realistic to be painless, and yet it's the kind of movie violence that leads children to think it doesn't really hurt to be hit in the crotch with a 2 by 4. On the kidnapping: Bink never looks upset, so it doesn't seem scary. SEX None. PROFANITY Very mild. For Which Children?  AGES 3-6 Will probably laugh at the very parts that make parents wince. Will need help understanding kidnapping. AGES 7-10 Afterward, you may want to talk about how stunt men work, so older children can make the distinction between movie violence and the real thing.
