        <p>Dr. Robert J. Stein, the first person to hold the post of medical examiner in Cook County, Ill., , died Tuesday at Highland Park Hospital in Highland Park, Ill., his hometown. He was 82.</p>
        <p>The cause was complications of gastrointestinal surgery, said his son Peter.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stein was named the first medical examiner of Cook County -- Chicago and environs -- in 1976, shortly after the post was created to make it a professional position. It replaced the old coroner's office, which had been filled by patronage.</p>
        <p>During a tenure of 17 years, Dr. Stein investigated more than 20,000 deaths, including those of the 33 men whose bodies were discovered on the property of the serial killer John Wayne Gacy. His largest cases were the Gacy killings and the 1979 crash of a DC-10 jetliner near O'Hare International Airport that killed 279 people.</p>
        <p>By the time he retired last year, he had gained international recognition for expertise in forensic pathology.  After his retirement, the county morgue was renamed the Robert J. Stein Institute of Forensic Medicine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Stein, a native of Russia, immigrated to New York, grew up in Brooklyn and graduated from medical school at the University of Innsbruck in Austria.</p>
        <p>In addition to his son Peter, who lives in Lake Forest, Ill., he is survived by his wife, Elsa, and another son, Dr. Ty Stein of Crystal Lake, Ill.</p>
