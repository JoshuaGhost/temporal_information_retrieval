        <p>JAMES (BUSTER) DOUGLAS was hospitalized in serious but stable condition and was being treated for complications of diabetes, the Grant Medical Center in Columbus Ohio, announced yesterday. Douglas, 34, was being treated for diabetic keto-acidosis in the hospital's coronary-care unit. The announcement was the first statement the hospital has released about the former champion since he was admitted Monday.</p>
        <p>No other details were released at the request of Douglas's family, the statement said. Messages left at the home of his father, BILL, and the office of his business manager, LAWRENCE NALLIE, were not returned. No one at a recreation center Douglas built on the city's east side after he became champion had further information.</p>

        <p>JAMES (BUSTER) DOUGLAS was hospitalized in serious but stable condition and was being treated for complications of diabetes, the Grant Medical Center in Columbus Ohio, announced yesterday. Douglas, 34, was being treated for diabetic keto-acidosis in the hospital's coronary-care unit. The announcement was the first statement the hospital has released about the former champion since he was admitted Monday.</p>
        <p>No other details were released at the request of Douglas's family, the statement said. Messages left at the home of his father, BILL, and the office of his business manager, LAWRENCE NALLIE, were not returned. No one at a recreation center Douglas built on the city's east side after he became champion had further information.</p>
        <p>Diabetic keto-acidosis is a type of diabetes common in children who are not able to produce insulin, said JANET GORMAN, a nurse with the Central Ohio Diabetes Association.</p>
        <p>"This tells me that his diabetes is going to be harder to control," Gorman said. "He will have to take insulin the rest of his life." She said it is not life-threatening if the patient follows prescribed insulin treatments. Douglas was the heavyweight champion for only eight months.</p>
        <p>He was a 42-1 underdog when he won the title in February 1990 with a 10th-round knockout of the then-undefeated MIKE TYSON in Tokyo. Eight months later, an out-of-condition Douglas lost his first title defense in three rounds to EVANDER HOLYFIELD.</p>
        <p>Douglas weighed 232 pounds when he beat Tyson and 247 against Holyfield. Douglas is now said to weigh more than 350 pounds. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BOXING</p>
