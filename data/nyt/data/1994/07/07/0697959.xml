        <p>The oddest thing about the JVC Jazz Festivals is that they are, year in and year out, much better in practice than on paper. The concerts are badly presented, usually fueled by that most tired of formulas, the tribute. They never address any of jazz's hot topics, nor do they, like Lincoln Center's jazz program (and the American Jazz Orchestra before it), indulge in programming that finds its backbone in a theme. Nevertheless, over and over again, the festival pulls off a handful of concerts that are truly special.</p>
        <p>This year's festival was no exception, and most of the epiphanies came from the least likely places. A concert built around the pianist Dick Hyman, a fine player and historian but hardly known for his transcendental abilities, turned out to be, well, transcendental. Mel Torme, the 68-year-old singer, performed a concert full of bravura and showmanship and stunning musicality, which was a pleasure both for the musicians and the audience. And at what could have been a jam session run amok, last Friday night's tribute to the Rev. John Garcia Gensel, the pastor to the jazz world, the constantly shifting group of improvisers maintained a level of music that's often found in clubs but rarely on concert stages.</p>

        <p>The oddest thing about the JVC Jazz Festivals is that they are, year in and year out, much better in practice than on paper. The concerts are badly presented, usually fueled by that most tired of formulas, the tribute. They never address any of jazz's hot topics, nor do they, like Lincoln Center's jazz program (and the American Jazz Orchestra before it), indulge in programming that finds its backbone in a theme. Nevertheless, over and over again, the festival pulls off a handful of concerts that are truly special.</p>
        <p>This year's festival was no exception, and most of the epiphanies came from the least likely places. A concert built around the pianist Dick Hyman, a fine player and historian but hardly known for his transcendental abilities, turned out to be, well, transcendental. Mel Torme, the 68-year-old singer, performed a concert full of bravura and showmanship and stunning musicality, which was a pleasure both for the musicians and the audience. And at what could have been a jam session run amok, last Friday night's tribute to the Rev. John Garcia Gensel, the pastor to the jazz world, the constantly shifting group of improvisers maintained a level of music that's often found in clubs but rarely on concert stages.</p>
        <p>A good portion of the success of the Hyman and Gensel concerts stemmed from their dependence on a common language, a common set of rhythmic ideas and a common harmonic vocabulary. Had the two shows exchanged half their performers, the music wouldn't have suffered a bit, despite differences in age, race and styles, though not sex, as this critic didn't see any women onstage at any of the dozen or more concerts attended. These shows were a tribute to the ability of good or even ordinary musicians to elevate the standard 32-bar song form and its relative, the 12-bar blues form, to greatness.</p>
        <p>The concerts showed that nearly a century after the formation of both the basic jazz language and the song structures, the forms are still pliable and still allow for real improvisation in the right hands. Jimmy Heath's saxophone solo, "Lester Leaps In," at the Gensel tribute, with its belly-deep honking notes and its darting in and out of conventional harmonies, or the trumpeter Wallace Roney's inspired rewriting of "Con Alma" the same night, showed how a neutral subject, like a song or the blues form, could inspire musicians to make real achievements.</p>
        <p>Ten years ago it might have been easy to bemoan the loss of ability on the part of younger musicians, the loss of that common language. But at "A Historic First Meeting," a big-band blastoff between the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band led by Jon Faddis and Wynton Marsalis's Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, much of the music was played by bands whose personnel ranged from their early 20's to their 70's. There was a sense that big bands, those great reservoirs of knowledge and jazz's original music schools, are still flourishing as academies. The same could be said about Slide Hampton's band, which turned in a brilliant show early in the festival. One had only to look at the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra's reed section to see the 72-year-old Norris Turney, taking his sparkling blues choruses, casting a mighty impression.</p>
        <p>The concert was enormously rich with ideas as well. Not only did it present differing conceptions of the role and abilities of a repertory orchestra (a term now disavowed by both Mr. Faddis and Mr. Marsalis), with Carnegie Hall's team using contemporary arrangements while Lincoln Center's drew mostly on Ellington, but it also made comparisons to the classicism of the European orchestral tradition seem inane. These were richly improvised performances, almost all worth hearing as new pieces, not as interpretations.</p>
        <p>The free outdoor concerts, the richest with promise, suffered the most, in part because five hours of anything is grueling, especially since JVC's pet demons -- incompetent sound systems -- were out in force. But the concerts offered a pleasant, democratic way to hear musicians usually confined to clubs. The saxophonist Thomas Chapin's set with his trio was ebullient; he knows how to fill that sort of space. David Sanchez, a young tenor saxophonist, had an almost unbelievably fluid improvisational flow, effortless and swinging, as if Stan Getz had been imagined through Wayne Shorter and John Coltrane. And the saxophonist and composer Julius Hemphill, closing the outdoor performances, led his sextet through his acrid and beautiful harmonies.</p>
        <p>Two last images. Somewhere between 1 and 2 A.M. on June 28, Lionel Hampton rose from his seat at the Iridium and sat down at the piano. Wynton Marsalis and three exceptional young trumpeters, Marcus Printup, Nicholas Payton and Russell Gunn, joined later by an unidentified and good young trumpeter and the veteran trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, were onstage. Mr. Hampton began playing "How High the Moon," and for half an hour the trumpeters went at it. Mr. Hampton, playing two-handed piano, outswung them all with his polished elegance. Mr. Printup chopped down all the other trumpeters, with Mr. Payton coming in behind him.</p>
        <p>The next night at the Iridium, the young alto saxophonist Abraham Burton was making his first club appearance, and some participants in the shootout between the Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center orchestras came to hear him play. Mr. Marsalis sat in on a blues, Kenny Clarke's "Royal Roost," which is also known as "Tenor Madness." The two went at it, riffing, trading solos, playing an inspired polyphony. It was as exciting as music gets, and it wasn't part of an institutional program, or on a concert stage or even in front of a big audience. At both events, the audience heard jazz played at the high level that has become almost ordinary nowadays, by musicians who used two standards, both older than most of their interpreters, as doorways to brilliant improvisation.
