        <p>AMERICA'S postwar boom brought with it an official style and an official narrative. The mood was optimistic. The cars, the kitchen appliances and even the people were shiny and bright.

        <p>AMERICA'S postwar boom brought with it an official style and an official narrative. The mood was optimistic. The cars, the kitchen appliances and even the people were shiny and bright. After a depression and a world war, the vision of a split-level suburban house and a happy nuclear family took up permanent residence in the national brain. All endings were happy ones. Officially, there were no shadows.</p>
        <p>Well, forget all that.</p>
        <p>With the persistence of a recurring nightmare, images of the other postwar America now stalk the land, offering lurid testimony of an alternative nation -- an America of cheese, tease and sleaze -- of bondage princesses, third-rate dinosaur and outer-space movies, dark and violent tough-guy thrillers, scandal rags, "nudie-cutie" adult films, body-builders, hot rodders and juvenile delinquents.</p>
        <p>In an orgy of historical revisionism, collectors, amateur historians and the style-hungry have been working the margins of late-40's and 50's America, turning over rocks and peering into forbidden corners with the savage glee of a gang of bikers holding Ozzie and Harriet hostage.</p>
        <p>There's a lively market in drugstore pulp paperbacks, scandal magazines (especially if the cover shows trash goddesses like Mamie Van Doren or Jayne Mansfield), and pinup art. Video distributors, having worked their way through the B material, are frantically exhuming levels C and D, in some cases bringing out 50's films that never even made it to the screen. Publishers like Vintage have reissued a slew of tough-guy 50's crime writers like Jim Thompson and Charles Willeford. Picking up the scent, Showtime recently asked a handful of well-known directors to remake 1950's B movies for a new series, "Rebel Highway."</p>
        <p>"People think of the 20 years after the war as this Eisenhower, golf, 'Leave It to Beaver,' plastic sort of time, but there was a real undercurrent of sex, violence, mystery and exploitation," said Alan Betrock, an archivist who publishes collectors' guides to popular scandal and girlie magazines like Confidential, Dare, Glance and Naked Truth.</p>
        <p>The cover lines sizzled. "To Get Him Back I Had to Become . . . A Cheap Pickup." "Those Naughty, Naughty Stories About Diana Dors." "Have You Tasted Forbidden Love?" "Hollywood Dope Racket." The magazines offered everything that television didn't.</p>
        <p>Did the people at Disney know about this? And couldn't they do anything to stop it?</p>
        <p>"These magazines sold 35 million copies a month," Mr. Betrock said. "Confidential was the largest-selling newsstand magazine in America. This wasn't a small thing; it was a big thing."</p>
        <p>It's still a big thing. James Ellroy has mined a rich vein of sleaze in books like "The Big Nowhere," "L.A. Confidential" and "Hollywood Nocturne," double-hard-boiled crime stories that make Los Angeles in the early 50's seem like a bubbling cesspool. Everyone is crooked, the double-cross is the usual form of human interaction, the cops are barely distinguishable from the creeps they bust. The prose is nonstop uppercuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellroy, whose next novel, "American Tabloid," will be published by Knopf in the fall, takes a ghoulish pleasure in mingling with his kind of people, whom he describes, with pleasure, as "the peepers and prowlers, homosexual informers and hepcat junkies, voyeuristic cops and dope addicts."</p>
        <p>Those were the days.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Ellroy sees a kind of innocence behind the world he describes. "Back then, square Americans knew the dark stuff was out there, but it was contained," he said. "It didn't have a name; it wasn't thrashed out on television like it is today. People want to go back into an era when there were shadows."</p>
        <p>There are many roads back into the murk. Through their Norton record label, Miriam Linna and her husband, Billy Miller, repackage little-known rebel rockers and ultrafrantic rockabilly singers like Hasil Adkins and Johnny Powers, the ultimate in teen alienation.</p>
        <p>Their series "The Raging Teens," now at three volumes, offers a seeming impossibility: New England rockabilly.</p>
        <p>"You wouldn't think you'd get one volume of that," Mr. Miller said, "but we may put out Volume 4." (Volumes 1 through 3 include promising angry-teen titles like "Gangwar," "Gimme the Keys" and "Renegade.")</p>
        <p>Pride of place in the Norton catalogue goes to Link Wray, master of the scary, reverb-rich guitar solo. "I like the Hell's Angels instrumental kind of stuff, when he was a real maniac," said Ms. Linna, who pointed out that Mr. Wray's 1958 hit "Rumble" was the only instrumental ever to be banned as a possible incitement to gang warfare.</p>
        <p>At Kim's Video in the East Village, a sign near the door promises "horror, sci-fi, mindless action and gratuitous violence" by the best of the nation's drive-in auteurs. This includes special sections for biker films, juvenile-delinquent films, exploitation films and, of course, the complete works of Ed Wood Jr., the legendary director of "Plan 9 From Outer Space," "Jail Bait," "Bride of the Monster" and other triumphs of cinematic incompetence.</p>
        <p>Wood has become a figure of fascination for revisionists. A cross-dresser, he played a thinly disguised version of himself in the very strange "Glen or Glenda," a film that was made in 1953 but not released until 1981. "The world still wasn't ready," Michael Weldon justly noted in his seminal guide, "The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film."</p>
        <p>But the wheel of history has turned. Today, Wood stands as a towering anti-auteur, technically awful but mysteriously compelling. (Tim Burton, the director of the Batman films, is making a feature film on his life and work.) And along with him, a host of despised cinematic subgenres have risen from the depths.</p>
        <p>Video companies like Sinister Cinema in Medford, Ore., and Something Weird in Seattle are busy mining every one of them, from horror, sci-fi, juvenile delinquent and exploitation to such intriguing hybrids as sword-and-sandal meets sci-fi ("Hercules Against the Moon Men") and horror westerns ("Billy the Kid Meets Dracula").</p>
        <p>"This was the fun stuff that didn't make any apologies," said Michael Barson, the editor of the forthcoming "I Married a Monster From Outer Space: Tear-and-Send Postcards From the Truly Terrible Fantasy and Science Fiction B-Movies of the 40's and 50's" (Pantheon).</p>
        <p>As Mr. Barson sees it, this type of movie holds up a lot better than the top-of-the line product. "It has an honest energy now, while the classy end of the spectrum is not so much fun anymore," he said. " 'Gigi' may be great, but as a kid in the 50's you didn't care. What you really wanted to see was 'From Hell It Came,' in which a walking tree monster was brought back by voodoo."</p>
        <p>The appetite for films like "Spider Baby" may seem suspect, perhaps even a little decadent, but the taste for trash masks a serious purpose: the recovery of forms of expression that were denied by the dominant culture. At the same time, researchers in this terrain experience the undeniable appeal of a time in which subcultures really were sub. Body-builders, teen-age rebels, hot rodders and beatniks revolved in their own orbits, undisturbed by the glare of television lights.</p>
        <p>"There was a sense that you could have a private world, and it wouldn't get co-opted or diluted," said Michael Stern, who with his wife, Jane, has written a number of books about popular culture. "Drag-strip guys and the early surfers felt that they had discovered paradise, and it was theirs alone. They didn't get on 'Geraldo' to share it with the rest of us."</p>
        <p>The devotees of Betty Page, the pinup and bondage queen, could not have shared their enthusiasm even if they had wanted to. It was barely legal.</p>
        <p>The cult of Ms. Page eclipses even that of Ed Wood Jr. Almost 40 years after she withdrew into obscurity, her star shines more brightly than it ever did in her brief heyday, from 1951 to 1957.</p>
        <p>Ms. Page, who lives quietly in California, avoiding the press, arrived in New York in 1948 from Tennessee with dreams of becoming an actress. Instead she ended up doing nude modeling for magazines like Eyeful, and Wink. Hundreds of others did, too. Only Betty Page lives on, instantly recognizable for her signature short black bangs, voluptuous figure and mile-wide smile.</p>
        <p>Certainly the hundreds of Page photos that survive look innocent enough by modern standards, as do her only film performances, in "Teaserama" and "Striporama." Her fans can find more explicit material on any newsstand or in any small-town drugstore. But they don't want explicit. They want Betty Page.</p>
        <p>The boom began in the mid-80's, when Dave Stevens, a cartoonist, included a Betty Page look-alike in his comic book The Rocketeer, introducing the vanished pinup goddess to a new audience and galvanizing old-timers. One fan, Greg Theakston, began publishing The Betty Pages, a TV Guide-size magazine that presented photographs as well as biographical material. In Chicago, a play, "The Betty Page Story" enjoyed a five-month run at the Prop Theater and has inspired a sequel, "Good Time Girls," scheduled to open in late September. Later this month, St. Martin's Press will publish "Betty Page Confidential," a collection of essays and photographs made after she fled New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Page towers over the competition, but the interest in postwar cheesecake extends far and wide. Mr. Barson has put together a set of trading cards for Kitchen Sink Press that reproduces the cover illustrations of girlie magazines of the 40's and 50's. The tireless Ms. Linna of Norton records explores the genre in a fanzine called Smut Peddlers, devoted to pulp paperbacks like "Campus Tramp" and "Lavender Love Rumble," as well as adult magazines and cartoons.</p>
        <p>In New York, the Wessel O'Connor Gallery has presented one-man shows of two physique photographers, Bruce of Los Angeles and Robert Mizer, whose studies of young male body-builders in the late 40's and 50's often appeared in digest-size magazines, ostensibly for use by artists.</p>
        <p>"There were somewhere between 12 and 18 studios of physique photography in California at the time," said William O'Connor, a co-owner of the gallery. Then, in 1966, the Supreme Court ruled that a picture showing a frontal male nude was not necessarily obscene.</p>
        <p>"After that, all hell broke loose, and everything became pornographic," Mr. O'Connor said. "I think a bit of the eroticism and mystery was lost."</p>
        <p>The nostalgia for a world with limits and restraints hangs heavy over the whole enterprise of redefining the 40's and 50's. Yes, the mainstream culture was repressive and bland, but just look at all the wonderful weirdness that flourished along the edges. Somehow, somewhere along the line, fans believe, something precious has been lost.</p>
        <p>Even sleaze can be innocent. The 50's may not have been "Leave It to Beaver," but even the dark side seems wholesome by current standards. There were zip guns and switch-blades instead of AK-47 assault rifles, goofballs and reefers instead of crack, Wink instead of Hustler.</p>
        <p>"Back then there was this big, wonderful, healthy, thriving mainstream pop culture," Mr. Stern said. "When you know there's that bedrock, you can dip your toe into naughtiness and not get swallowed up."</p>
