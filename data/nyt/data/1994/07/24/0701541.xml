        <p>HISTORY  MEDIEVAL LIVES  Eight Charismatic Men and Women  of the Middle Ages. By Norman F. Cantor. HarperCollins, $23.</p>
        <p>Norman F. Cantor, the author of "The Civilization of the Middle Ages" and "Inventing the Middle Ages," takes another look at the period in "Medieval Lives," this time by offering portraits of eight dynamic figures. He begins with Helena Augusta, the mother of the Roman Emperor Constantine, as she conducted a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 326 to recover the True Cross, and ends with John Duke of Bedford, the brother of Henry V, who struggled to hold France for the English crown following Henry's death in 1422. The author presents all eight in a contemporary light, with an emphasis on trendy issues like empowerment, gender and diversity. He discusses Alcuin of York, an Englishman who headed Charlemagne's palace school; Cardinal Humbert of Lorraine, whose proposals for papal reform led to the schism between Eastern and Western Christianity; Hildegard of Bingen, a visionary abbess who fought male domination of the church hierarchy. It is sometimes disconcerting to read references to sexism and multiculturalism in the fourth century or to see Augustine described as "very much a hands-on bishop." However, Mr. Cantor's decision to "dissolve the bafflement of archaic language and articulate in the language of today, at risk of superficial anachronism" is generally successful. The scenes he devises, though sometimes wooden and talky, compress a surprising amount of medieval ideology and social history into a readable and engaging format.  DAVID WALTON</p>
