        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"The civil war tearing Yemen apart threatens wider troubles," you write in "Yemen: Risky War, Cautious Response" (editorial, July 5). Yet you fail to mention the true vested interest of the neighboring countries in the region, namely the Saudis and their allies.</p>
        <p>A news article June 6 from Sana, Yemen, stated: "Saudi Arabia was reportedly unhappy with a unified democratic Yemen, which it apparently saw as a threat to its domination of the region."</p>
        <p>The reason is obvious: Yemen stands to be the seed of democracy in that region. It has demonstrated this potential with the last parliamentary election in 1993, which was monitored and recognized by international observers. Democracy in a united Yemen, therefore, poses a threat to the ruling families of the Saudis and their allies in the region.</p>
        <p>Yet the quick support and assistance to the rebels by the Saudis and their allies goes beyond quelling democracy in the area; their support of the breakaway south is in reprisal for Yemen's support of Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>However, the vinegar of one man is the honey of another. It is my belief that the people of the region, not the governments, consider the unification of Yemen a sweet prospect, for a unified Yemen stands to foster democracy throughout the region. Yemen has taken the lead in introducing democracy in the area and should be encouraged to stay the course.</p>
        <p>Staying on that course should be encouraged by the Clinton Administration. Moreover, the United States should encourage regional mediators, with special emphasis on weeding out those in support of despotism and a divided Yemen.  ABDO A. ZANDANI  Staten Island, July 8, 1994</p>
