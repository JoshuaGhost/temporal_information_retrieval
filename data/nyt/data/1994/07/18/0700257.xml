        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made no secret of his unhappiness with New York City's school system. Last week he received a proposal that would largely break up the central Board of Education. Although he did not fully endorse the plan, the Mayor said he would like to "crush" the board's infamous bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>But the plan given the Mayor seems shaped by politics rather than a sensible, coherent approach to improving schools. If Mr. Giuliani seriously wants to help city schoolchildren, he will stop the rhetorical excesses and show calm leadership on education reform.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has made no secret of his unhappiness with New York City's school system. Last week he received a proposal that would largely break up the central Board of Education. Although he did not fully endorse the plan, the Mayor said he would like to "crush" the board's infamous bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>But the plan given the Mayor seems shaped by politics rather than a sensible, coherent approach to improving schools. If Mr. Giuliani seriously wants to help city schoolchildren, he will stop the rhetorical excesses and show calm leadership on education reform.</p>
        <p>Tension between the Board of Education and City Hall is inevitable. The board is a semi-independent agency, but it represents the largest item in the city's budget. In addition, the school system itself is pulled between a centralized headquarters operation and decentralized school districts.</p>
        <p>The entire system suffers from crazy-quilt accountability. Each of the five borough presidents appoints one of the seven central board members and the mayor selects two. The 32 community boards are elected every three years, but barely 10 percent of the voters turn out.</p>
        <p>Several weeks ago, Mr. Giuliani asked Edward Costikyan, a former Manhattan Democratic leader and now a Giuliani supporter, to propose an overhaul of the system. Mr. Costikyan's final report, released last week, is a mishmash that does not add up to a thoughtful blueprint for reform.</p>
        <p>For starters, he would replace the Schools Chancellor -- now selected by the board -- with a commissioner of education who would be chosen by the mayor with the approval of the City Council. It makes sense to give the city's highest elected official more responsibility for the schools. But putting a mayoral appointee over the schools would make them even more vulnerable to political shifts, wipe out any semblance of independence and undermine academic credibility. What respectable schools chief would want to be under the mayor's thumb?</p>
        <p>New York City's schools have endured the turmoil of 6 chancellors in 11 years. After nearly a year in the job, Ramon Cortines is exercising real academic leadership and getting a handle on administrative changes. This is hardly the time to undermine his efforts by pushing for a plan that makes him obsolete. What is needed is a balance -- a strong, relatively secure chancellor and a mayor influencing school policy through a larger number of appointees to an expanded Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Costikyan's plan, the central board would be largely replaced by five borough boards. That, too, is a bad idea. It adds an unnecessary bureaucratic layer and, as envisioned, could encourage schools not to provide services like special education.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Costikyan makes some sensible suggestions on spending money according to the needs of individual schools, his treatment of the corruption issue is inadequate. Too many community boards have been plagued by corruption. Mr. Costikyan endorses legislation pending in Albany to help clean them up. But even that would not warrant giving community boards broad new responsibilities without proper monitoring.</p>
        <p>As serious educational policy, the entire exercise rings hollow. Mr. Giuliani seems to have adopted the board, its bureaucracy and Mr. Cortines's budgeting skills as political targets. Mr. Costikyan's report focuses less on improving what happens in classrooms than on providing a rationale for Mr. Giuliani's sniping. That is hardly a prescription for leadership -- or school reform.</p>
