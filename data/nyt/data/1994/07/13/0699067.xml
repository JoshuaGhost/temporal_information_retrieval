        <p>The Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee accused the Clinton Administration today of dragging its feet on a 117-nation free-trade pact, and warned that the measure might not win Congressional approval if action was not taken soon.</p>

        <p>The Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance Committee accused the Clinton Administration today of dragging its feet on a 117-nation free-trade pact, and warned that the measure might not win Congressional approval if action was not taken soon.</p>
        <p>The remarks by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York were the latest sign that while business lobbying for the latest pact to expand the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade seems to be winning support for the pact in Congress, the accord remains in trouble because Congress will be in session for only a few more weeks this year and health care legislation will dominate its time.</p>
        <p>Senator Moynihan said on the Senate floor today that he planned to hold a committee hearing next Tuesday to produce the necessary legislation to approve the pact and put it into legal force in the United States on the scheduled date of Jan. 1, 1995. But he threatened to postpone the hearing unless the Administration decided this week how it wanted to pay for the pact, which was concluded last December.</p>
        <p>"Delay creates risks, it breeds opposition," Senator Moynihan said, adding that he still strongly favored the pact. Offsetting a Loss</p>
        <p>Administration officials insisted today that they wanted to put the agreement through Congress this summer but were vague about when they would settle on a way to offset the loss of about $12 billion in import tax revenue that the agreement would eliminate during the next five years.</p>
        <p>Leon Panetta, the outgoing director of the Office of Management and Budget and the new White House chief of staff, said at a White House news conference on the budget, before Senator Moynihan's speech, that Administration officials would hold talks throughout the week with Congressional Democrats and Republicans.</p>
        <p>"I can't give you a firm date as to when all of this is going to be nailed down, other than to say that we're making good progress on it and our hope is that we can get GATT adopted by the Congress before the August break," he said.</p>
        <p>Anne R. Luzzatto, the press secretary for the Office of the United States Trade Representative, said after Mr. Moynihan's remarks that, "We appreciate the chairman's support and we're working night and day to get the information to the Hill to meet the chairman's deadlines."</p>
