        <p>Although it opened just a few weeks ago, First, an East Village storefront with an eclectic mix of foods, is already a happy place to eat. The owners, Stephen Billings, Joanne Coraci and Samuel DeMarco, seeing how Blue Ribbon has built a thriving late-night crowd in SoHo, hope to do the same thing on First Avenue, serving food until 2 or 3 A.M. nightly. But the food, with nods to Mexico, Thailand, Japan, France and Italy, is delicious at any hour.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeMarco, the chef, last cooked at Luxe, a luxury Manhattan restaurant that closed this year. Now he has taken a less-expensive turn that does not sacrifice creativity. Crisp squid rings ($6.50), for example, are far superior to ordinary fried calamari. This dish is an artful composition of squid perfectly fried in a salt-tinged batter and arranged around slices of sweet-and-spicy pickled ginger and slivers of marinated seaweed, with a small bowl of wasabi-flavored mayonnaise.</p>

        <p>Although it opened just a few weeks ago, First, an East Village storefront with an eclectic mix of foods, is already a happy place to eat. The owners, Stephen Billings, Joanne Coraci and Samuel DeMarco, seeing how Blue Ribbon has built a thriving late-night crowd in SoHo, hope to do the same thing on First Avenue, serving food until 2 or 3 A.M. nightly. But the food, with nods to Mexico, Thailand, Japan, France and Italy, is delicious at any hour.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeMarco, the chef, last cooked at Luxe, a luxury Manhattan restaurant that closed this year. Now he has taken a less-expensive turn that does not sacrifice creativity. Crisp squid rings ($6.50), for example, are far superior to ordinary fried calamari. This dish is an artful composition of squid perfectly fried in a salt-tinged batter and arranged around slices of sweet-and-spicy pickled ginger and slivers of marinated seaweed, with a small bowl of wasabi-flavored mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>Grilled chicken satay ($6.50) is another splendid appetizer, the chicken, served on a stick, spicy and moist, set off by a cooling pineapple-cucumber salsa. Salmon tartar ($8) is also a thoughtful composition, ground salmon mixed  with mustard oil, capers and onions arranged over greens and surrounded by salty salmon roe, which go beautifully with the rich fish. It comes with thin baguette slices, just right for making little open sandwiches. Gazpacho ($7) is the only  appetizer that doesn't excite. It's certainly fresh enough, and the four jumbo shrimp with it are fine for dipping, but the flavor is surprisingly one-dimensional.</p>
        <p>All this inventive food makes one wonder about the restaurant's motto, "Inner city flavor," a bit of marketing silliness that Mr. Billings translated as "Hearty flavors and large portions." The dining room itself exudes downtown flavor with its long brick wall, muted colors, scalloped ceiling and unusual hammered-metal tables in front near the bar. A long thin cable stretches from the top of the front wall to the rear above the open kitchen like a laundry line, holding a metallic sculpture resembling an enormous silver sea urchin. The lush carpeting, tablecloths and soft banquettes keep the noise at a gentle level, though the music occasionally gets too loud. Typically in the East Village, service is at times amateurish, though always friendly, and smoking is  apparently permitted anywhere.</p>
        <p>Main courses combine simple ingredients to produce complex flavors. Fusilli with thin slices of chorizo, white beans and broccoli rape and greens ($12.50) is a sumptuous rustic blend. Hanger steak ($15) is beefy and chewy, served with  a slab of pungent blue cheese that melded lusciously with the meat. Duck ($14.50) is tender and rich, marinated in honey and soy and served with a fresh  fruit salad of ginger, blueberry and apple. A pork chop ($12.50), which will appeal to anyone who likes a chop as thick as a porterhouse steak, is paired with rice and beans and fried sweet plantains. The only combination that doesn't work is pan-seared salmon ($13.50) with a harsh curry coating that overwhelms the bland fish.</p>
        <p>The wines, like the food, are moderately priced and show evidence of careful  thought. Among the wines that go well with these dishes are a fruity German riesling from M. Prum ($19), New World Red ($19) from Edmunds St. John in California and an excellent pinot noir ($21) from Domaine de Clarck in California.</p>
        <p>At each meal, the warm chocolate pudding cake ($4.50) was recommended enthusiastically and with good reason. It's like a wonderfully moist brownie. Caramel creme brulee ($4.50) is just right. Apple tart ($4.50) is fair, but the  scoop of cinnamon ice cream on top gradually bathing the pastry made me very happy.</p>
