        <p>The 72-year-old Mr. Lindsay, apparently suffering from heat exhaustion, felt  faint as he stood on Track 18 about 10:15 A.M. and was taken to the hospital by  the Emergency Medical Service, the police said. It was unclear how long he might be hospitalized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsay, who was the Mayor of New York City from 1966 to 1973 after serving four terms in Congress, has a history of heart disease and has been in fragile health in recent years. He underwent surgery to repair a heart valve in  January 1988, suffered a mild stroke in March 1989 and was hospitalized in January 1990 after collapsing at a luncheon with what was diagnosed as a drop in blood pressure.</p>
