        <p>IN a novel approach to treating toxic shock syndrome, researchers in Seattle have developed a chemical that blocks the formation of a protein responsible for the life-threatening consequences of the disease.</p>
        <p>The protein, tumor necrosis factor, plays a critical role in the body's normal immune response to tumor cells and infection but can cause severe damage when produced in excess amounts. This is what happens in the case of toxic shock. The protein exists in two forms, a long form that is anchored inside the cell but extends outside its membrane, and a shorter form that is soluble and is released to roam in the blood. It is when too much of the soluble form is released that problems occur.</p>

        <p>IN a novel approach to treating toxic shock syndrome, researchers in Seattle have developed a chemical that blocks the formation of a protein responsible for the life-threatening consequences of the disease.</p>
        <p>The protein, tumor necrosis factor, plays a critical role in the body's normal immune response to tumor cells and infection but can cause severe damage when produced in excess amounts. This is what happens in the case of toxic shock. The protein exists in two forms, a long form that is anchored inside the cell but extends outside its membrane, and a shorter form that is soluble and is released to roam in the blood. It is when too much of the soluble form is released that problems occur.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roy A. Black and a team of researchers at the Immunex Research and Development Corporation have found a way to prevent the release of soluble tumor necrosis factor into the blood by blocking the protease, the enzyme that directs the cell to turn it loose. Their findings are reported in the current issue of the British journal Nature.</p>
        <p>The tests so far have been on mice, and Immunex officials said more animal testing must be done before the company decides whether to begin the long process of clinical trials needed to obtain Federal approval of a drug. Complication of Blood Poisoning</p>
        <p>Tumor necrosis factor has been linked to a number of autoimmune diseases, including arthritis and multiple sclerosis, as well as asthma and transplant rejection, said Dr. Steven Gillis, the chief executive of Immunex. Biotechnology companies have been in a heated competition to find ways to inhibit its function. Several widely touted discoveries in the field have failed to live up to their early promise.</p>
        <p>Immunex researchers believe that their discovery of the release mechanism has enabled them to develop a unique approach, Dr. Gillis said. Dr. Paul R. Sleath, a chemist with Immunex, developed the hydroxamic acid compound that inhibits the processing of the factor.</p>
        <p>Toxic shock, a rare form of septic shock, a dangerous complication of blood poisoning, is best known for its association with tampon use and has also been linked to staphyloccocus and strep A bacteria infections. It occurs when an otherwise healthy body mounts an excessive immune response to a large bacterial infection. Symptoms include fever, diarrhea and nausea, and in some cases, shock, organ failure and death.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles J. Fisher Jr., a leading investigator of septic shock who is the director of critical-care research at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, said the protease inhibitor is "very exciting because it is a small molecule" that would be easy to distribute throughout the body at the cellular level.</p>
        <p>"Further, it has the potential, by virtue of being a small molecule, to be made into a medication that can be taken orally," he said.</p>
        <p>Each year more than 400,000 Americans are affected by some degree of sepsis, Dr. Fisher said. Of those cases, some 250,000 progress to become septic shock, including cases of toxic shock, and more than 100,000 people die as a result.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kendall M. Mohler, an immunologist, tested the most stable of the compounds in mice injected with a dose of bacterial toxins large enough to cause fatal toxic shock. Half were also injected with the protease inhibitor. Some 85 percent of the mice that received the inhibitor survived.</p>
        <p>Dr. Black said that further study is needed to determine whether other autoimmune diseases related to the production of tumor necrosis factor will respond to similar treatments.</p>
