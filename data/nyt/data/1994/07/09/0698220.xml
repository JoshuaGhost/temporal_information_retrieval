        <p>The United States Coast Guard cutter Vindicator took 407 Haitians home today, the largest group since the Administration began processing refugee applications at sea, but Haitians kept arriving faster than ships could pick them up.</p>
        <p>To keep up with the flow -- since Monday, more than 10,000 have poured out of Haiti -- American officials said today that thay they plan to add staff and speed up operations so that next week they can send back 1,000 asylum-seekers a day.</p>
        <p>When the program began three weeks ago, the first few days brought only a handful of fleeing Haitians, but the number being interdicted at sea each day has risen to more than 1,500. Even the Banks Are Empty</p>
        <p>The Haitian Red Cross, which is involved in repatriation, said today that it was having difficulties finding money to give to the returning Haitians because the country's banks, which are starved for cash, cannot honor the agency's checks. But United States Embassy officials advanced the Red Cross enough money to hand $20 to returning Haitians.</p>
        <p>Before the new program, fleeing Haitians intercepted at sea were routinely returned to their country without being interviewed by immigration officials.  Once the offshore processing began, the number of boat people swelled, and to keep up, officials say they will increase the number of applications processed to 1,000 a day next week.</p>
        <p>"It's a little tight scheduling, but it can be done," said Stanley Schrager, a spokesman for the United States Embassy at Port-au-Prince. No Waves From Panama</p>
        <p>There was no sign that the decision from Panama not to allow Haitians to stay there temporarily will stem the flow of refugees that have taken to the seas in craft ranging from small rafts and 40-foot vessels.</p>
        <p>Scores of Haitian peasants interviewed have said that only the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, would prevent them from leaving their country. Father Aristide was ousted during a military coup in September 1991.</p>
        <p>Today, American officials recorded new radio messages intended to discourage Haitians from fleeing their country. The minute-long announcements in Creole will be broadcast throughout the country. The messages tell Haitians of the dangers of taking a boat, emphasize that the streets of the United States are not paved with gold and that the best way to apply for asylum is in one of three centers within Haiti.</p>
        <p>The Haitian military-backed government of Emil Jonassaint has done little to stop the exodus despite a recent declaration that it would enforce a 1980 law prohibiting such departures. Instead, the Government issued a communique earlier this week, accusing the United States of picking up legitimate fishermen as refugees.</p>
        <p>Some repatriated Haitians are arrested by military officials after being dropped off but most are released within 72 hours, and few if any are prosecuted.</p>
