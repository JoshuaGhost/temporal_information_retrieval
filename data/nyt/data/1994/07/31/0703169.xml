        <p>Some motorcycle rally. No one is popping wheelies. Men walk past monster bikes talking about their urologists. The women don't have tattoos. There are seminars. You can hear yourself think.</p>
        <p>T-shirts are on display in the vendors' tents. "This Is Your Brain," one says, over a BMW logo. "This Is Your Brain on Drugs," the next line says, over a Harley.</p>
        <p>This is a BMW rally, and this is what happens when Marlon Brando starts taking his wife along on his trips out of town, and when the real fun of what the couple refers to now as their "hobby" is getting there safely.</p>
        <p>For more than 5,000 owners of BMW motorcycles arriving here for the BMW Motorcycle Owners of America's international rally, this Connecticut River town  is a communal target, a common direction to steer in, just like Oshkosh, Wis., was last year, and as Durango, Colo., will be next year. BMW's are touring machines, autobahn bikes, built to eat up miles instead of tear around corners,  and rallies are places to gather and talk about the road.</p>
        <p>The Road Grows Slicker</p>
        <p>The road, however, is more expensive, more sophisticated, more gadget-oriented than it used to be, and the rallies reflect that. The top-of-the-line K1100LT, with anti-lock brakes, stereo cassette and automatically-adjusting wind screen, is $15,590. Shoei helmets are $280. Under the hot tents, the leather sales areas are air-conditioned.</p>
        <p>"It used to be a bunch of old guys getting together and talking about the places they'd been," said Jim Sylvia, who had just arrived from Martha's Vineyard on his classic 1967 BMW with a friend, Hellie Neumann, in his 1951 Bender sidecar. "It's changed in the last 10 years; I guess it's been sort of yuppified."</p>
        <p>Mr. Sylvia, who is 48 years old, has been riding since his teens, has been to the other kind of rallies, has fond memories, in fact, of very un-BMW weekends in Laconia, N.H., where motorcyclists used to run out of control.</p>
        <p>"It's one of the last rites left where you can go be yourself and get drunk and puke on your shoes," he said wistfully of Laconia. Ms. Neumann glanced over  from where she was blowing up their air mattress, smiling the kind of puzzled smile that women reserve for male nostalgia.</p>
        <p>But times have indeed changed, and as talk turned to the differences between  BMW owners and Harley-Davidson owners, Mr. Sylvia segued easily into the details of Harley's stock price. "It's split twice," he said, wistful again. "I think I'm too late to get into it."</p>
        <p>He left it to another friend, Jimmy Burgoff, whose usual sidecar companion on the Vineyard is his dog, Salaam, to get down to basics. "What's the difference between a Hoover and a Harley?" he said. "With a Hoover, the dirt bag's on the inside."</p>
        <p>Harleys, however, have come a long way from the Hell's Angels, and these days are as upscale as BMW's, marketed to the same kind of professionals that BMW appeals to in ads that say: "It's even more fun than cornering the stock market." Harleys, besides their image, offer a sharper jolt to riders, while BMW's are built for distance and speed.</p>
        <p>There are much bigger rallies. Laconia. The Americaid in Lake George, N.Y. Bike Week in Daytona. The thunder of Harleys in Sturgis, S.D. BMW owners are still trying to figure out what they have in common with other BMW owners besides a love for big, smooth-running machines that leave them still able to walk at the end of a day astride them.</p>
        <p>"If you want to do some sports-riding or canyon-bashing, those Japanese bikes will outperform a BMW," said Jim Bateman, who had ridden in from Denver. "But if you try to ride one of those 600 miles in a day, well, it'll beat you to death."</p>
        <p>The club sponsors an annual mileage contest. Last year's winner logged 102,976 miles in six months, which computes to an average of eight hours a day speeding 70 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>More Definitions</p>
        <p>Not everyone can identify with that. A recent writer to the club's magazine  couldn't quite decide what to call the high-milers (as they call themselves), skipping back and forth between "crazy," "obsessed," "maniacs," "anti-social," "insane" and "suicidal."</p>
        <p>The international rallies do attract high-milers, acknowledged Deb Lower, the chairwoman of this rally, who rode her motorcycle from Denver in May to begin the preparations here.</p>
        <p>Irv MacDougal, who had ridden up from Daytona, Fla., was proceeding on to Boston before meeting his son in Peoria, Ill., and touring out to Colorado with  him. He was cutting back a little, though; last year he went on to Alaska.</p>
        <p>"I always say, I ride my Harley from tavern to tavern; I ride my BMW from state to state," Mr. MacDougal said as he washed and polished his bike.</p>
        <p>But suicidal? The standing-room-only crowd in a seminar on "What to Pack and  Where to Put It," mainly couples, was interested in the latest in waterproof packs and inflatable mattresses and pillows, two essentials to touring.</p>
        <p>If life is a series of compromises, it is not hard to imagine who compromises most on vacations that the wife spends sitting behind her husband on a motorcycle. So it pays to be, most of all, practical.</p>
        <p>"Let me tell you guys," a motorcycling outfitter, Dave Witmer, told his audience, "you keep her dry and comfortable, and you'll do a lot more touring."</p>
        <p>After the laughter stopped, he had their full attention.</p>
