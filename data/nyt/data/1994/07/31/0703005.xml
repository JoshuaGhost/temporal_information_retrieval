        <p>THE Studio Museum in Harlem has sent on the road a small excerpt from its collection -- 46 works out of about 1,500 -- and the first port of call is the Montclair Art Museum.</p>
        <p>Valerie Mercer, associate curator of the Harlem museum's collections, masterminded the show, expanding upon one that was recently organized on behalf  of Paine Webber. The result is a crowded but cool anthology that spans the last  25 years of work by black painters and sculptors in the United States.</p>
        <p>It begins -- or rather waylays the viewer -- with Kerry Marshall's "Silence  Is Golden." This three-quarters figure is a silhouette in black except for the teeth and whites of the eyes, and it is posed against a background of olive green, playfully suggesting the silence with one upraised hand. On the right is  a stack of rectangles, one containing a red cross against white, another a lattice of red, black, green and yellow, and still others in solid colors.</p>
        <p>The execution is smooth but the image is as sardonic in spirit as any by Robert Colescott and, hung at the entrance to the show, threatens to dominate it. Mr. Colescott himself is represented by "Auvers-sur-Oise," a relatively demure drawing in charcoal on a scroll. It features, at the top, Van Gogh with a bandaged ear; at the bottom, an apparently American painter at work in a Hawaiian shirt, complete with headset, and, between the two, skeletons cavorting in bikinis.</p>
        <p>Another memorable image is the gouache-drawing of a parrot "inhabited" by a figure that stands against a background busy with flowers and decorative scribble. This is the work of an "outsider" artist, Nellie Mae Rowe.</p>
        <p>There are many Norman Lewis works that make an impact out of all proportion to their cobweblike consistency. An example here is the 1973 lithograph that is  a row of figures drawn in a fine orange line on gray paper.</p>
        <p>Almost as fragile-looking are the drawings spread over large sheets of paper  by Barkley Hendricks and John Dowell. Mr. Hendricks's incorporates a small, shadowy self-portrait together with lines and a compasslike shape; Mr. Dowell's  consists of lines and insectlike notations scattered Steinberg style.</p>
        <p>Apropos notations, Howardena Pindell makes some of her own, using sequins, glitter and confetti on long strips of fabric (or paper). These she lashes together and covers with creamy paint. The result is a wall hanging that is both soarkling and opaque.</p>
        <p>With the painting "Nativity," Manuel Hughes contributes a Dali-esque kind of  mystery -- broken fragments of plastic that hang in a pink and blue space but also cast multiple shadows.</p>
        <p>Jack Whitten's "Dead Reckoning" of 1980 is as diagrammatic as his later monochrome abstractions but hardly as rich in its textures.</p>
        <p>Though the predominant color is green, "Jammin' at the Savoy," a collage by late Romare Bearden, has the overheated look that characterizes much of the work produced by the artist in his latter years. On the other hand, Sam Gilliams's canvas blotted with blue and the occasional red seems atypically drab for the artist as he was in 1968.</p>
        <p>Things pick up in the sculpture category, and not just with the lone piece from the "Lynch Fragment" series of Mel Edwards, which is reproduced on this page, but also with the works of Richard Hunt and Nadine DeLawrence. Mr. Hunt's  is "Hybrid No. 3," a yearling shape that in outline evokes Rodin's "Prodigal Son" but that is part female torso and part protuberances suggesting antlers. The DeLawrence sculpture is an engaging work that, made of aluminum stained pink, green and blue, suggests a rake's top hat.</p>
        <p>As already indicated, the display is less than could be. It has a high proportion of good work, including the Betye Saar assemblage, also reproduced on this page, and a handsome William T. Williams canvas of 1969 that is all diagonals in all colors.  But it could use more space between the objects and more than one explanatory statement.</p>
        <p>Even so, before this lineup of the knowns and the unknowns leaves next Sunday for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, it should have lured not a few visitors to the Studio Museum itself.</p>
        <p>The Montclair Museum is at 3 South Mountain Avenue. Its summer hours are noon to 5 P.M. Wednesday through Sunday.</p>
