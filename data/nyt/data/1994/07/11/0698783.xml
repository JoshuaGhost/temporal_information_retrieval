        <p>GOLF  Robbins Wins Playoff for L.P.G.A. Title  Kelly Robbins birdied the first playoff hole yesterday to win the Jamie Farr Toledo L.P.G.A. Classic in Sylvania, Ohio. Robbins and Tammie Green finished 54 holes tied at nine-under-par 204. Robbins then rolled in a five-foot putt for a birdie on the par-4 18th hole, the first of the playoff, while Green left a 16-foot birdie putt inches short. Robbins shot a final-round six-under 65 at the 6,319-yard Highland Meadows Golf Club, with birdies on four of the final nine holes. Green had a 67. Kim Williams, who was struck by a stray bullet while entering a drug store after the second round of last weekend's Youngstown-Warren Classic, had a 70 and finished tied for 10th at 210 with Amy Alcott and Dawn Coe-Jones.

        <p>Losing Streak Ends: Mark McCumber shot a 66 and broke his five-year drought in impressive fashion, chipping in for consecutive back-nine birdies on the way to winning the Anheuser-Busch Golf Classic in Williamsburg, Va. McCumber, who also won the Anheuser-Busch in 1987, finished four rounds of the 6,797-yard layout at 17-under 267, one shot off the tournament record. (AP) TENNIS  Bruguera Wins Third Straight Swiss Title  Top-seeded Sergi Bruguera defeated Guy Forget, 3-6, 7-5, 6-2, 6-1, yesterday to win the Swiss Open in Gstaad for the third consecutive year. Forget started strongly, attacking Bruguera's ground strokes. Forget, who was sidelined by a knee injury for nearly a year, reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon last week, and his performance this time as a wild-card entry should see his world ranking rise from 1,130 to about 100. (AP) AUTO RACING  Unser Defeats Mansell in Cleveland  Al Unser Jr. led from start to finish and beat Nigel Mansell by nearly 24 seconds in the Budweiser Cleveland Grand Prix. It was Unser's fifth victory in eight Indy-car races this year, and the seventh straight triumph on the circuit for Marlboro Team Penske. Paul Tracy and Emerson Fittipaldi have each won once for Penske during the string. Unser won from the pole for the second straight race, moving to the front at the start and steadily pulling away in his Ilmor-powered Penske racer. Unser's unofficial average speed of 138.30 m.p.h. was a record for the 2.37-mile temporary course at Burke Lakefront Airport, the fastest road course on the Indy-car series. Tracy was third.
