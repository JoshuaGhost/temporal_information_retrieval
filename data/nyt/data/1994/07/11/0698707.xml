        <p>AN Inspector General's report scheduled to be the subject of a Congressional hearing today suggests that the National Institutes of Health, by failing to track patented technologies developed in part through Federal financing, may have abdicated the Government's rights to valuable medical inventions.</p>
        <p>"We're talking about billions of dollars of taxpayer money that goes toward developing these technologies," said Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who is conducting the hearing by the House subcommittee on regulation, business opportunity and technology, of which he is the chairman. "The N.I.H. isn't minding the store."</p>

        <p>AN Inspector General's report scheduled to be the subject of a Congressional hearing today suggests that the National Institutes of Health, by failing to track patented technologies developed in part through Federal financing, may have abdicated the Government's rights to valuable medical inventions.</p>
        <p>"We're talking about billions of dollars of taxpayer money that goes toward developing these technologies," said Representative Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, who is conducting the hearing by the House subcommittee on regulation, business opportunity and technology, of which he is the chairman. "The N.I.H. isn't minding the store."</p>
        <p>The report, prepared by the Health and Human Services Department's Inspector General, states that "fundamental problems exist with N.I.H.'s ability to monitor" whether recipients of financing from its Extramural Research Administration have complied with a law requiring that the role of such money be acknowledged in patent applications.</p>
        <p>The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was meant to speed the commercialization of discoveries. It permits those who develop technologies with the aid of Federal money -- whether from the N.I.H. or another agency -- to keep the profits from a technology. But the patent applications covering such technology are supposed to specify that the Government retains certain privileges.</p>
        <p>Chief among those privileges are "march-in" rights, which allow the the Government to intervene and potentially co-license technology when it believes an invention is being improperly commercialized.</p>
        <p>The Government has apparently never exercised its march-in rights. But legislators like Mr. Wyden say the privilege serves as a big stick to prevent price gouging by pharmaceutical companies and others.</p>
        <p>The Inspector General's office focused on the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif., finding that Scripps had acknowledged Government financing in 51 of 121 patents reviewed. Investigators considered that a suspiciously low number given that Scripps, the largest nonprofit bio-medical research institution in the United States, gets $70 million of its annual $120 million budget from N.I.H. and other Government sources.</p>
        <p>Saying that it had made inadvertent reporting errors that had since been corrected, the institute subsequently revised the number of patents it identified as originating from Federal research to 94, from 51.</p>
        <p>"Scripps is a microcosm," Mr. Wyden said in a telephone interview last week. A number of institutions spot-checked by the Inspector General, he said, "appear to have a rather dramatic under-reporting of Federal involvement in technology that is later patented."</p>
        <p>Most of 23,000 organizations that received grants from the N.I.H.'s nearly $7 billion extramural budget in 1993 were nonprofit institutions like universities and research institutes. But many of these institutions license their patents to companies that commercialize the technology.</p>
        <p>Last month, for example, Scripps got the Government's clearance for a $200 million partnership with Sandoz Pharmaceuticals, which will develop inventions made by the institute's scientists.</p>
        <p>The Assistant Secretary of Health, Philip R. Lee, who oversees the N.I.H., said in a written response to the report that an effort to track down patents that improperly failed to acknowledge Government support would "result in an enormous burden that we believe would show little gain in compliance."</p>
        <p>A former director of technology transfer at N.I.H., Reid G. Adler, who is now a partner at the Washington law firm of Morrison &amp; Foerster, concurred, saying that the spirit of Bayh-Dole was to spur commercialization. "The staff resources available at N.I.H. for technology transfer are very limited to start with," he said. "It should be careful about how many resources are diverted for policing activities."</p>
        <p>A Snap-On Method To Anchor Dentures</p>
        <p>About 20 million Americans have lost their teeth and many of them use dentures as a substitute -- an imperfect solution, according to Dr. Neal B. Gittleman, a prosthodontist in Houston.</p>
        <p>"Dentures rub, they ulcerate," he said. "Most people I see are dental cripples. It can be psychologically debilitating to have to excuse yourself from the table to rinse out your mouth every time you get food stuck."</p>
        <p>Dr. Gittleman has developed a new type of denture-anchoring device that he hopes will be an alternative to a technique developed in recent years for anchoring individual or groups of false teeth deep into the jawbone. That process yields an effect much closer to real teeth, but it is lengthy and expensive.</p>
        <p>"Everything is made by hand and you have to build it from the ground up," Dr. Gittleman said. "The idea is to offer to the masses something similar that is prefabricated and affordable."</p>
        <p>Dr. Gittleman said that with his technique dentures would snap onto a titanium foundation that rested just above the lower gum but was permanently anchored to each side of the jawbone by clasps embedded under the soft tissue of the mouth. The titanium foundation would be tacked into the jawbone at the front of the mouth where the patient's lower incisors used to be.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gittleman said the dentures could be mass-produced in different sizes and then easily adjusted to fit different mouths. Although he has not performed the procedure -- and animal experiments would have to be conducted before such an implant could be tried in people -- he said installing the titanium structure would take three to four hours.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gittleman received patent 5,306,150. New Phone Features Dial-Tone Indicator</p>
        <p>When Henry Gifford of Mahattan started using his new cordless telephone, he became irritated.</p>
        <p>"It was a nuisance turning the phone on and having to bring it to my ear to listen for a dial tone before bringing it back in front of me so I could see to dial," he said.</p>
        <p>So, he designed a "dial-tone annunciating system and method," which features a small light near the keypad that lights up when the dial tone is present.</p>
        <p>"Some phones have a little light that tells you the phone is talking to the base, but that doesn't mean anything to me," Mr. Gifford said. "The light still comes on even if there is no dial tone."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gifford received patent 5,327,494.</p>
