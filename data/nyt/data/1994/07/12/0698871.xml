        <p>A former director of the Soviet Union's largest missile factory won Ukraine's presidential election on Sunday after promising to cooperate more closely with Russia and to speed economic reform.</p>
        <p>The victory by the industrialist, Leonid D. Kuchma, shocked nationalists, who fear he will push Ukraine back into Moscow's orbit. He denies any such intention but he must deal quickly with a deepening split between nationalistic western Ukraine and the Russian-speaking eastern part of the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma, a former Prime Minister, defeated Ukraine's first President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, who was forced to call early elections in the middle of a steep economic decline. Mr. Kuchma got 52 percent of the vote, to 45 percent for Mr. Kravchuk.</p>
        <p>Both men are former Communists. But Mr. Kravchuk, who was fervently supported in the western half of Ukraine, campaigned as an experienced statesman and the best guarantor of sovereignty, stability and unity. He accused Mr. Kuchma of a dangerous willingness to accommodate Russia over issues like the former Soviet fleet in the Black Sea, a source of dispute between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma promised an alternative to the current economic disaster, including an immediate cut in taxes. He also focused on the collapse of living standards. Economic output fell by 30 percent in the first four months of this year, workers are not being paid on time and the national currency, once equal to the ruble, is now worth less than 5 percent of a ruble.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma said that Ukraine's history and its failure to modernize had left it dependent on Russia for energy, timber, raw materials and industrial orders, and that closer economic ties and a free-trade agreement were a prerequisite for Ukrainian well-being. Those who voted for him seemed less interested in joining Russia than in getting Russian business.</p>
        <p>Like the populist President-elect in Belarus, Aleksandr Lukashenko, Mr. Kuchma criticized the corruption and complacency of Government while ordinary people suffered.</p>
        <p>As in Belarus, which also held its presidential election on Sunday, the incumbents in Ukraine were penalized for their failure to effect real change in this newly sovereign state, thus undermining the idea of sovereignty itself. From the Communist Elite</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma and Mr. Kravchuk were both members of the old Communist elite. But while Mr. Kravchuk was a party bureaucrat and a secretary for ideology, Mr. Kuchma spent his life in industry, working as the missile factory's party organizer before rising to director, a job won through merit even in the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The election results highlight the deepening split between eastern and western Ukraine, heightening fears among diplomats that Ukraine may split, with the eastern part and the Crimean peninsula in the south realigning with Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma's first task will be to reassure western Ukraine and the passionate nationalists there that he intends to protect their interests. He began this evening upon arrival in Kiev, calling the campaign's divisions between east and west "criminal," implying it was Mr. Kravchuk's strategy to exploit regional fears. 'We Can Overcome This Split'</p>
        <p>"If we act intelligently, we can overcome this split," he said. Ukraine is one of the largest countries of Europe, with a population of 52 million, of whom 11 million are ethnic Russians, mostly working-class voters concentrated in the east.</p>
        <p>While Ukraine has agreed to rid itself of inherited nuclear weapons, most of which are useless for defense anyway, it remains the world's third-largest nuclear power. During the campaign, Mr. Kuchma also raised questions about the need for rapid ratification of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which was promoted by Mr. Kravchuk. Any such hesitancy is bound to worry Washington.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Kuchma has promised compliance with an agreement by Ukraine, Russia and the United States to rid Ukraine of nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>Today's result will please Moscow, which has had a bumpy relationship with Mr. Kravchuk. Mr. Kuchma, for instance, has said that Ukraine has no real use for the Black Sea Fleet and that he would be content to sell Ukraine's share to Russia for gas and oil and to lease the fleet's headquarters at Sevastopol to Moscow.  Doing the Numbers</p>
        <p>According to official preliminary results announced late today by the Central Election Commission, Mr. Kuchma received 52.15 percent of the votes and Mr. Kravchuk had 45.06 percent. Turnout was 69 percent, two points more than during the first round two weeks ago. Final results should not affect the outcome.</p>
        <p>"Leonid Kuchma has become the second President of Ukraine," said Igor Tseluiko, a secretary at the Central Election Commission.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma, 55, won about two-thirds of the votes in eastern Ukraine, where ethnic Russians dominate, and nearly 90 percent in Crimea, where the population is 70 percent ethnic Russian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk, 60, took most of the votes in western Ukraine, which was only Sovietized after World War II. In the Lviv region, for instance, he received 94 percent of the vote. There, Mr. Kuchma is regarded as a "traitor" to Ukraine who may undermine the country's hard-won independence. Mr. Kuchma has denied any such intentions. They Voted, Didn't They?</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma's aides tried to calm passions. About Crimea, for instance, they stressed that 70 percent of the population voted in Ukrainian election. Thus one aide said: "The question is moot whether Crimea will remain in Ukraine or not. It's resolved."</p>
        <p>They noted that he is also working to improve his weak spoken Ukrainian.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk, despite his ideological past, took the country to independence as the Soviet Union broke up. He was elected President in a landslide in December 1991 for a five-year term. But his ambivalent efforts at economic reform were stalled by an unchanging party, the bureaucratic elite and a Parliament held over from the Communist era.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma's 11 months as Prime Minister were marked by a frustrating failure to begin even modest economic reforms, nearly all of which were blocked by Parliament and the Cabinet. He resigned last September and broke with Mr. Kravchuk, and their relations have been bitter.</p>
        <p>After a severe miners' strike over poor pay and conditions, Mr. Kravchuk agreed to early elections. The parliamentary voting this spring went against him, however, producing a majority of neo-Communists and eastern Ukrainians as the nationalists and democrats in the Rukh movement splintered over policy and personalities. Tending Toward the Middle</p>
        <p>The parliamentary results caused Rukh to throw its support unambiguously to Mr. Kravchuk. Mr. Kravchuk, a noted political strategist, then moved to the left, naming a former Communist Prime Minister, Vitaly A. Masol, to run a new Government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk also called for closer economic ties to Russia, while Mr. Kuchma softened calls for Ukraine to adopt the ruble as its currency.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kuchma kept his eastern base and did surprisingly well in the central farming district, which had voted in the first round for the neo-Communist parliamentary speaker, Aleksandr O. Moroz. Mr. Moroz, who also ran for President in the first round, has talked of a parliamentary state, dispensing with a presidency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kravchuk got a big boost on Saturday, the day before the vote, when the major industrial democracies, meeting in Naples, approved $4 billion in aid to Ukraine, subject to progress on economic reform, and an initial $200 million to help Ukraine shut down the nuclear reactors at Chernobyl.</p>
        <p>But the support came too late.  A Need for Sausages</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuchma spent most of his career at Yuzhmash, the missile factory in Dnepropetrovsk, in eastern Ukraine, 300 miles from Kiev, which he took over in 1986 after two decades on the shop floor. In the 1950's, President Nikita S. Khrushchev boasted that it turned out missiles like sausages.</p>
        <p>It will be Mr. Kuchma's task now to turn out sausages, or at least to make them affordable in a country where the average monthly wage is $15, compared to $100 in Russia.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, Mr. Kuchma said: "The main thing is to stop lying to the people. A genuine leader is not one who knows how to tell beautiful lies, but rather one who can bravely tell the truth, even in the most difficult times."</p>
        <p>Like Winston Churchill, one of his heroes, he said: "I am not promising the Golden Kingdom for tomorrow. But what I promise I will fulfill, without searching for 'objective reasons' as to why something cannot get done."</p>
