        <p>Big Mig is back.</p>
        <p>Riding with his accustomed power, Miguel Indurain trashed the Tour de France pack today in an individual time trial and started toward his fourth consecutive victory in the world's greatest bicycle race.</p>
        <p>There had been some doubts about the Spaniard's strength and speed because he finished third in the three-week Giro d'Italia in June after two consecutive victories in that race. Worse, he failed to win a time trial after dominating the race against the clock in the Giro for two years.</p>
        <p>Not to worry. Indurain answered his critics in the initial 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) as he clocked the fastest time to that first checkpoint. Then he began gathering speed.</p>
        <p>Barely 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) later, he had overhauled the rider who started two minutes before him, Lance Armstrong of the Motorola team. Other victims began turning up regularly in Indurain's wake.</p>
        <p>At the end of the 64-kilometer (39.7-mile) time trial from Perigueux to Bergerac in the extremely hospitable Perigord region of southwestern France, the problem was nearly total.</p>
        <p>Indurain, who rides for the Banesto team, finished at least four minutes ahead of all 175 other riders except for his main rival, Tony Rominger. And the Swiss, who rides for Mapei-Clas, was able to limit his loss only to two minutes.</p>
        <p>The winner was timed in 1 hour 15 minutes 58 seconds over a demanding course in stifling heat in the low 90's. An intermittent light breeze did nothing to hinder the riders but kept tens of thousands of fans along the course from swooning.</p>
        <p>"Despite the heat, I tried to do my maximum, and I think I succeeded," said Indurain, who can understate almost as well as he can time trial. His face impassive, he gulped water from a big bottle once across the line and then continued: "I think we have the team to defend the jersey." Astronomical Numbers</p>
        <p>He is wearing the yellow jersey of the overall leader by 2:28 over Rominger, with Armand De Las Cuevas, a Frenchman with Castorama, third, 4:40 behind. Thereafter the numbers belong to astronomy.</p>
        <p>De Las Cuevas finished third today with a deficit of 4:22. Thierry Marie, another Frenchman with Castorama, was fourth, 4:45 behind, and Chris Boardman, the Englishman who rides for the Gan team and who wore the yellow jersey for three days after he won the prologue on July 2, was fifth, 5:27 behind. Boardman is in seventh place over all.</p>
        <p>Looking wan, Rominger paid the obvious tribute. "I have to admit that Indurain was stronger today," he said.</p>
        <p>Rominger, who had spurts of bad luck last year when he finished second to Indurain in the Tour, had a flat tire a bit less than halfway through the stage and lost perhaps 30 seconds while having his wheel changed.  Mountains Are Obstacle</p>
        <p>Wearily referring to his two-minute deficit, he said, "I'll have to see if I can make it up in the mountains."</p>
        <p>This 81st Tour will enter the Pyrenees on Wednesday and the Alps next Tuesday. The end of the three-week race is scheduled in Paris on Sunday, July 24.</p>
        <p>Although there will probably be many challenges and surprises before then, Indurain answered the big question today. He regained his rhythm, he said, in the first eight stages of the Tour.</p>
        <p>He demonstrated that rhythm as he rode along a twisty back-country road that had several patches of melted tar. Up the gradual climbs and down the sinuous descents went Indurain, his body immobile from the waist up to reduce resistance, his face set in concentration, his line of attack through the many turns always tight.</p>
        <p>His power and speed were plain to see. At the 15-kilometer (9.3-mile) checkpoint, he led Rominger by 55 seconds, De Las Cuevas by 1:02 and Boardman, the former holder of the record for the hour's ride against the clock, by 1:36.</p>
        <p>The lead increased by the next checkpoint, at Kilometer 29.8 (Mile 18.5), where Rominger was 1:23 behind, De Las Cuevas 1:59 behind and Boardman 2:28 behind.</p>
        <p>The road became gentler after that, its curves tamed and its surface smoother. Indurain kept pounding and caught and passed De Las Cuevas with 10 kilometers to go. Earlier Casualty</p>
        <p>An earlier casualty of the Indurain flypast, Armstrong, the American who is the professional road-race world champion, finished in 13th place, 6:23 down. He was hoping to monitor his development in the race against the clock since the last Tour and the finding was mixed: Last year he lost 6:04 to the winner, again Indurain, but finished 27th.</p>
        <p>Further down the list was Luc Leblanc, the Frenchman with Festina who rashly decided Sunday to expend his energy by impressing fans in his native region and going on a long and personally unsuccessful breakaway.</p>
        <p>Leblanc finished 26th today, 8:04 down, and ranks 16th over all. Possibly Leblanc believed all the hooey about Indurain's loss of dominance and thought the time trial would be close.  CYCLING</p>
