        <p>When Norplant went on the market in 1991, it was hailed as a "dream contraceptive," a breakthrough for women who could have a simple, 10-minute insertion procedure and then not worry about getting pregnant for five years.</p>
        <p>But now that nearly a million American women have chosen to have the hormone-releasing capsules implanted in their arms, some users charge that removing a Norplant can be a painful and complicated matter.</p>
        <p>Some 400 women are seeking to join a class-action lawsuit against Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the company that sells Norplant. They contend that they suffered severe pain and scarring when their doctors removed the six matchstick-size capsules.</p>
        <p>"We heard from 200 women by June 30, and another 200 in the last week and a half, as there has been more publicity," said Jewel Klein, the lawyer who has brought the case.  "This is a method that only went on the market in 1991, and is supposed to last five years, so this is just the beginning." Ms. Klein filed the suit in Chicago in September on behalf of an unidentified plaintiff, and a Cook County judge certified it as a class action last month so that any woman who had suffered injury from removal of the device was eligible to join in the lawsuit. Pain and Scars</p>
        <p>Ms. Klein said that some of her clients had gone through several painful attempts at removal or needed surgery under general anesthesia to remove the contraceptive. Other women were left with extensive scars, she said.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction to prevent Wyeth-Ayerst from selling the contraceptive to doctors who have not been trained to insert and remove it. Ms. Klein estimated that $20,000 to $50,000 in damages would be sought for most of the women.</p>
        <p>Wyeth-Ayerst said in a prepared statement that the vast majority of Norplant removals were not difficult.</p>
        <p>"The procedure usually takes about 15 to 20 minutes, no stitches are required and bruising is minimal," Dr. Marc W. Deitch, vice president and medical director at the company, said in the statement.</p>
        <p>According to the statement, the incidence of difficulties with Norplant removal was below the 6 percent rate predicted by the company based on early studies.</p>
        <p>Wyeth's statement also said the company believed the class-action litigation was "inappropriate" because the removal of the Norplant devices was an individual procedure affected by many variables, including the way the capsules were originally inserted, the procedure used for removal and the particular patient's circumstances.</p>
        <p>The company said it had instructed more than 28,000 doctors and medical assistants on the proper procedures for inserting or removing Norplants. But Wyeth does not require that doctors who buy the devices meet any special training requirements.</p>
        <p>About 20 percent of Norplant users drop the method in the first year, either because of side effects like irregular menstrual bleeding or because they want to become pregnant.</p>
        <p>Doctors and nurses familiar with Norplant agree with Wyeth that removing the capsules is usually uncomplicated when the contraceptive has been inserted properly.</p>
        <p>"I have done about 500 removals and my average is about 15 minutes," said Lybia Burgos, a nurse-practitioner who trains doctors to insert and remove Norplants at Planned Parenthood of New York City and the Staten Island University Hospital. "I tell patients that I will try for half an hour and if it takes longer than that, they will have to come back a second time. But I have only had two cases where they had to come back. It's very important for doctors to get the right training. If they do, it's usually a tiny incision, and easy to get the Norplant out."</p>
        <p>But where the capsules have been implanted too deeply and are difficult to find, or where large masses of scar tissue have formed around the capsule and make it difficult to extricate, removal can be complicated and may require several operations.</p>
        <p>Some doctors and women's health experts say they are concerned that the publicity about the occasional complications with Norplant removals will frighten some women away from what many still see as an excellent contraceptive method.</p>
        <p>"There is no perfect contraceptive, but Norplant is getting pretty close," said Alexander C. Sanger, president of Planned Parenthood of New York City. "It absolutely is a method that should be offered to every woman seeking contraception."  Decline in Demand</p>
        <p>But many doctors and clinics say demand for Norplants has been falling off over the last year, partly in response to negative publicity and partly because of the appeal of a new, cheaper contraceptive, Depo Provera, which lasts for three months and requires only an injection.</p>
        <p>"Since Depo Provera came on the market, Norplant has lost some of its glamour," said Sue Ortileva, a nurse-practitioner at Planned Parenthood in Sacramento, Calif., who has removed about 300 Norplants. She said she now saw more demand for removals than insertions.</p>
        <p>"In a smooth removal, you numb the arm, make a tiny incision, go just below the surface of the skin, remove the fibrous tissue that has formed around the capsule, grasp the capsule with a little instrument that looks like a curved tweezer, and slide it out," Ms. Ortileva said. "The problem is finding the capsules. You're operating entirely by feel, so if they're too deep, or they've been pushed out of their original placement, they can be hard to find."</p>
        <p>"Sometimes I've had to poke around for an hour, at which point the tissue is so swollen you can't find anything, and you have to ask the person to come back a month later after it's healed, and try again," she said, adding that some of her patients had been referred by doctors who said they were not equipped to perform removals. "A lot of women are scared now, saying they just want their Norplant out, to make sure it will come out. I tell them it will be just as easy, or just as hard, in a few years."</p>
