        <p>The players' labor leader is resigned to a strike. The owners' chief representative is "much less optimistic" than he had been about the chances of averting a strike. In short, after yesterday's brief and meaningless bargaining session, no one had any suggestion that something would happen to keep the players playing after Thursday's games.</p>
        <p>"There is an air of inevitability that we will not reach an agreement," said Donald Fehr, head of the union.</p>

        <p>The players' labor leader is resigned to a strike. The owners' chief representative is "much less optimistic" than he had been about the chances of averting a strike. In short, after yesterday's brief and meaningless bargaining session, no one had any suggestion that something would happen to keep the players playing after Thursday's games.</p>
        <p>"There is an air of inevitability that we will not reach an agreement," said Donald Fehr, head of the union.</p>
        <p>Richard Ravitch, the owners' man, didn't sound much different, but he tried to offer one glimmer of hope.</p>
        <p>"When you're in a collective bargaining situation like this, and the subject matter is as important as baseball is to as many people," he said, "I wouldn't dare predict what is going to happen between now and Friday. That doesn't mean the fairy godmother is going to descend with a solution, but I don't know everything that's going to happen." An Empty Meeting</p>
        <p>Given the firm, diametric positions the two sides have taken, it seems like the Wicked Witch of the West has inflicted so much damage that no fairy godmother could undo it.</p>
        <p>Negotiators met for an hour and a half yesterday but did not address the salary cap issue that divides them. They spent the time discussing proposals the players made last week on such matters as having waivers faxed to the Players Association instead of mailing them and the procedure of designating players for assignment.</p>
        <p>As Ravitch said, "Nobody is going to strike over any issue that was discussed today."</p>
        <p>Nor will they over the subjects that are on the agenda for discussion at today's subcommittee meetings. There won't be any sign of the salary cap there either. Presumably, the two sides will get to the core issue tomorrow, though as of late yesterday afternoon, no definite meeting had been set.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the two sides stride closer toward baseball's eighth shutdown in the past 23 seasons. Players Are Ready</p>
        <p>"The players are ready to go out," Fehr said. "We're getting questions about whether players should fly out after games Thursday or wait until Friday. Players assume the strike will take place."</p>
        <p>It will take place because the owners won't budge from their cap proposal and the players won't consider buying into it.</p>
        <p>"The players will not address the issues that are of concern to us," Ravitch told a news conference. "They want to talk about the basic agreement in the context of how the players will get more money. We want to talk about it in terms of how we can deal with the problems of the game."</p>
        <p>Ravitch reiterated his position that the owners are willing to listen to any suggestion the players might have that addresses the owners' desire for cost certainty. Waiting for a Response</p>
        <p>"We should be addressing the central economic question," he said, "maybe not under the terms and conditions that we would like to see ideally, but at least a give-and-take on that issue.</p>
        <p>"We hoped all along we would get a response to our proposal, either that the percentage is too low or the transition period is too short. But we have heard no such response to any aspect of what we're seeking. We can't negotiate with ourselves. As long as Don says no, the owners do not intend to put a different kind of proposal on the table."</p>
        <p>Fehr keeps saying no because the players have made it clear they want no part of a salary cap. If they were to propose a higher percentage than the 50 percent share of baseball revenue the owners have offered them, they would be buying into the concept and they refuse to.</p>
        <p>The gulf between the two sides is one of the reasons they have declined offers of help from outside agencies.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he would invite Robert Reich, the Secretary of Labor, to aid the negotiations, Ravitch said, "At this moment, I see no useful function that can be performed by the Secretary of Labor."</p>
        <p>The American Arbitration Association has offered the services of its "blue-ribbon panel" of mediators, but, an association spokeswoman, Tony Griffin, said, Fehr had declined, saying "the parties were as far apart as they could possibly be" and Ravitch has not responded.</p>
        <p>Asked yesterday about the possibility of mediation, Fehr said: "Mediation has its purposes, but at this point this does not have the air of a dispute people can find a way to settle. This has the air of a dispute the owners are intent on forcing. If that stays the case, neither mediation nor negotiating meetings or anything else is going to serve any purpose."  BASEBALL</p>
