        <p>After decades of vain and intermittent efforts, the Senate prepared today to open formal debate on restructuring the nation's health care system, the most ambitious social legislation to face Congress since the passage of civil rights measures in the mid-1960's.</p>
        <p>The debate, scheduled to begin late Tuesday afternoon, will bring the results of months of arduous committee work to the floor of a body fractured by philosophical differences with no sure sense of where it will wind up.  The Democratic leadership and President Clinton hope Congress will approve legislation by Election Day.</p>
        <p>The bill the senators will debate, to be offered by Senator George J. Mitchell, the majority leader, is intended to provide insurance for 95 percent of Americans by the year 2000, largely by subsidizing the poor. A commission would recommend ways to increase that total to universal coverage in 2002, and employers might then be required to pay some of the cost.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has said since his election campaign that he would accept nothing less than full coverage for every American. The Mitchell bill provides what may be the weakest version of universal coverage that he could accept.</p>
        <p>Even so, two conservative Senators, Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, and Richard C. Shelby, Democrat of Alabama, today threatened a filibuster. But it was not clear that they would have enough Republican allies to sustain one.</p>
        <p>The Senate hopes to clear its schedule of almost everything but health care by Wednesday. The plan is to break away only for final action on bills emerging from House and Senate conferences, like the crime bill.</p>
        <p>Once the formal debate begins, little real action is expected to occur until the end of the week. The Democrats would like to see the Republicans open with a challenge to the provision in Mr. Mitchell's bill that employers pay some of their workers' insurance costs. Democrats believe this would make it clear, especially to the House, how far the Senate might go on this provision, one of the most controversial in the health care debate.</p>
        <p>The Democrats hope to win the vote, but no matter what its outcome it would offer a political road map to House members nervous over voting on such an explosive measure. But it is not clear whether the Republicans will help them out with a challenge to employer payments.</p>
        <p>The House takes up its own health care bill, to be offered by Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the majority leader, next week.</p>
        <p>The chief differences between the Mitchell and Gephardt bills is that the House bill calls for insurance for all Americans by 1999. Employers would be required to pay 80 percent of the costs for their employees; those who do not work or work only part time would be covered by the Federal Government under an expansion of Medicare.</p>
        <p>Competing plans are expected to be offered in both bodies. But the process is moving slowly. The bills are running about 1,400 pages each, and the draftsmen who write the language in the actual bills and have them printed have not finished their work.</p>
        <p>The House, the more disciplined of the chambers, has tentatively scheduled a vote for its own legislation on Aug. 19. Though the the Senate begins a week earlier, many on Capitol Hill expect it to take another week to finish. Both chambers are cutting into their cherished August recesses, and they intend to pass legislation that negotiators can thrash out in conference and forge into a single bill ready for final passage by both chambers by October.</p>
        <p>Some senators have already called for the process to be scrapped this year, saying the legislation is too complex to ram through in so hurried a fashion. G.O.P. Effort to Halt Vote</p>
        <p>Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, offered an amendment, to a spending bill, that would force the Senate to put off the whole matter until next year. He said it was too important to be rushed through this year, and offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says Congress should "take whatever time is necessary to do it right" by waiting until next year. His measure is to be voted on on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Until today, Senator Gramm had avoided using the explosive threat of a filibuster. But he said today, "Anything I can do within the rules of the Senate to prevent the Government from taking over or controlling the health care market, I'm going to do, and I'm going to do it proudly."</p>
        <p>Senator Shelby was less circumspect. "Would I mind filibustering against something like this to kill it?" he asked. "Absolutely not."</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, avoided such language, which could backfire if Republicans appear obstructionist. While Mr. Dole maintains that the Mitchell bill needs more scrutiny, he has said, "There is no filibuster strategy." His own bill, which relies largely on changes in insurance regulation to increase coverage, was due out today but has yet to be printed.</p>
        <p>That did not stop the Clinton Administration from attacking it.</p>
        <p>"Opponents of real reform are arguing for another delay as they throw together incremental, half-way proposals that aren't even drafted yet," Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said today at a White House briefing.</p>
        <p>She released a report that the Administration clearly hopes will draw wavering Democrats to their cause.  State-by-State Pressure</p>
        <p>State by state and district by district it describes how many people lack insurance coverage and how universal coverage would reduce illness and save money.</p>
        <p>As an example, she used the state of New Jersey, the home of Senator Frank Lautenberg, an uncommitted Democrat.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shalala said New Jersey had nearly one million people without health insurance and 45,000 were losing their coverage every month. Of the people who have no insurance, she said, 83 percent work. "Clearly, the working people of New Jersey and their families can't afford to wait another year," she said. "This story is repeated in every state in this union."</p>
        <p>The White House also took pains to reaffirm President Clinton's determination on the issue. Harold M. Ickes, deputy chief of staff, scoffed at a report in The Los Angeles Times that if votes went badly in the Senate, President Clinton was prepared to settle for whatever he could get.</p>
        <p>"That is not where this President is," Mr. Ickes said. "He is absolutely foursquare behind universal coverage. He has been campaigning hard for it."</p>
        <p>In the Senate, leaders on both sides spent the day organizing their lieutenants and assigning different Senators to take the lead in dealing with different issues. Mr. Dole designated 10 of the most conservative Republican senators to take charge, including Mr. Gramm, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, Trent Lott of Mississippi and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell planned to have Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the two committee chairmen who handled health care legislation all spring, with him on the floor, while other Senators will be assigned specific issues. TO COME TODAY - Senate begins debate on health care legislation. Majority Leader George J. Mitchell has said he will keep the Senate in session six days a week and into the Congressional recess - originally scheduled to begin Aug. 12 - until a bill is deposed of. NEXT WEEK - House is scheduled to begin debate. Aug. 19 - Date by which Speaker Thomas Foley expects House to vote. September - Assuming each house has passed a health care bill, a Senate-House conference committee will try to resolve differences. October - If conference committee reaches agreement, final votes take place. Nov. 8 - Election Day.  THE HEALTH CARE DEBATE: THE LEGISLATION</p>
