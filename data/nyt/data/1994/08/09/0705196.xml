        <p>"Battle Royale: Trombones and Alto Saxophones" at Alice Tully Hall was mild-mannered as far as cutting sessions go. Cutting sessions, at which musicians try to out-improvise one another, are a practical result of one of jazz's axioms, that competition can produce revelations. But Sunday night's concert, part of the Classical Jazz series at Lincoln Center, didn't produce many. Instead, it made it clear that everybody involved knew exactly what to play, and that the musicians all respected their competition. Nobody lost, and everybody played well. Coming after a bitter, wide-ranging debate between Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of the series, and the biographer James Lincoln Collier, the show's graciousness was a relief.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with four trombonists, Al Grey, Slide Hampton, Wycliffe Gordon and Ronald Westray, who started with "Just Jazz," a composition by Mr. Grey arranged by Virginia Mayhew. Mr. Grey led off the solos with long, growling notes, followed by Mr. Westray, a 23-year-old trombonist who has been making appearances with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Mr. Westray has his own melodic arsenal, and he flashed it from his opening notes, patiently creating an angled structure that hung there until he introduced a line.</p>

        <p>"Battle Royale: Trombones and Alto Saxophones" at Alice Tully Hall was mild-mannered as far as cutting sessions go. Cutting sessions, at which musicians try to out-improvise one another, are a practical result of one of jazz's axioms, that competition can produce revelations. But Sunday night's concert, part of the Classical Jazz series at Lincoln Center, didn't produce many. Instead, it made it clear that everybody involved knew exactly what to play, and that the musicians all respected their competition. Nobody lost, and everybody played well. Coming after a bitter, wide-ranging debate between Wynton Marsalis, the artistic director of the series, and the biographer James Lincoln Collier, the show's graciousness was a relief.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with four trombonists, Al Grey, Slide Hampton, Wycliffe Gordon and Ronald Westray, who started with "Just Jazz," a composition by Mr. Grey arranged by Virginia Mayhew. Mr. Grey led off the solos with long, growling notes, followed by Mr. Westray, a 23-year-old trombonist who has been making appearances with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Mr. Westray has his own melodic arsenal, and he flashed it from his opening notes, patiently creating an angled structure that hung there until he introduced a line.</p>
        <p>On "Bag's Groove," the other young trombonist, Mr. Gordon, picked up on Mr. Hampton's last phrase and turned it into his first before moving into a burred tone that almost sounded like a kazoo. The first half was stolen by Mr. Grey, who performed a chorus of "Makin' Whoopee," part of a series of ballads, that swung so hard it was almost wondrous. Using a mute and a plunger, he gave a lesson in the power of tone, melody and swing.</p>
        <p>The second half opened with the alto saxophonists Charles McPherson, Phil Woods, Jesse Davis and Wess Anderson on "Blue and Boogie," taken at a tempo that beat them all, reducing the musicians to playing lines without much textural weight. On "Like Someone in Love," Mr. Woods and Mr. McPherson, backed by the rhythm section that had been playing all night (Eric Reed on piano, Ben Wolfe on bass and Clarence Penn on drums), turned in a performance that featured one of the concert's best improvisations. Mr. Woods patiently mixed melodic sections that had a hint of Benny Carter's dryness with blues ideas and the occasional line to produce a solo that shone with intelligence.</p>
        <p>On "Just a Mood" Mr. Anderson bent long notes, as if in homage to Johnny Hodges, and seemingly accelerated and slowed down the internal tempos of his improvisation. He, too, has a distinct melodic vocabulary, and he used it, spreading oddly shaped melodies through his improvisations.</p>
        <p>The show ended with the trombonists and alto saxophonists all performing on two tunes, a slow blues and a piece called "Ow!" In their full sound and short, precise improvisations, the performances gave a sense that the instrumentalists had music-making on their minds, not competition.

        <p>A picture caption yesterday about trombonists in a Classical Jazz concert at Lincoln Center reversed the order of the musicians shown. From the left, they were Ronald Westray, Slide Hampton, Al Grey and Wycliffe Gordon.</p>
