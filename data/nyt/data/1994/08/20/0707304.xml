        <p>Darrel Austin, whose thickly painted imaginary landscapes continued the visionary romantic tradition of William Blake and Albert Pinkham Ryder, died on Tuesday at his home in New Fairfield, Conn. He was 88.</p>
        <p>He had been ill for several years, said a friend, Robert H. Ellsworth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Austin was born in Raymond, Wash., and grew up in Portland, Ore. He studied art at the University of Oregon and Notre Dame University. For the Works Progress Administration, he executed murals for the University of Oregon medical school.</p>
        <p>Soon after his first solo exhibition at the Howard Putzel Gallery in Hollywood in 1938, he moved to New York, where the art dealer Klaus Perls saw his work. The Perls Galleries represented Mr. Austin for the rest of his life. Enchanted Landscapes</p>
        <p>Mr. Austin, who applied paint to canvas using a palette knife, was best known for enchanted landscapes populated by mythical bulls, tigers and elongated, spectral female figures. His work appeared in "Americans 1942: 18 Artists From 9 States" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and he was given a retrospective exhibition at the McNay Art Institute in San Antonio in 1982. His most recent show, at the Harmon-Meek Gallery in Naples, Fla., last year, was a survey of his work from 1944 to 1982.</p>
        <p>His work is in many public and private collections, including those of the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Phillips Collection in Washington and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.</p>
        <p>He is survived by a son, Darrel, of Connecticut.</p>
