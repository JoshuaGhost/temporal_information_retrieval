        <p>At business school, nobody told Corrado Passera it might someday get this difficult.</p>

        <p>At business school, nobody told Corrado Passera it might someday get this difficult.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Mr. Passera was given the job of fixing Olivetti S.p.A., the office-equipment company that is Europe's second-largest computer maker after Siemens Nixdorf Infomationssysteme A.G. of Germany. Since 1990, Olivetti has not had a profit, and over the last three years it has lost a total exceeding $1 billion. But if all goes according to his plan, by the end of this year Mr. Passera, chief executive of Olivetti, will finally come close to break-even.</p>
        <p>"It's been a painful and difficult process, but we've now succeeded in growing with fewer and fewer people," said Mr. Passera, who has overseen much of Olivetti's effort to cut 22,000 jobs since 1989, reducing the work force by 40 percent to a current level of 35,000. Attempting a Sea Change</p>
        <p>The turnaround is by no means certain because Mr. Passera is attempting what amounts to a makeover of Olivetti. Mr. Passera means to recast Olivetti -- a company that last year derived the bulk of its $5 billion in annual sales from hardware -- as an information technology company that within a few years would derive one-third or even fully half its revenue from computer services and telecommunications.</p>
        <p>Already, Olivetti has farmed out a lot of its computer manufacturing, including a deal with the Digital Equipment Corporation, freeing the company to concentrate more on designing, installing and maintaining computer networks for big corporate European customers like Barclays Bank P.L.C.</p>
        <p>And in recent months, Olivetti has signed a string of deals with large American communications companies -- including the Bell Atlantic Corporation, Pacific Telesis and the General Motors Corporation's Hughes Network Systems unit -- to provide wireless communications services in Italy and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
        <p>In expanding beyond computers, an industry bled in Europe by cutthroat price cutting and the region's long recession, Olivetti must contend with bigger competitors that were earlier to make such moves, including Siemens Nixdorf and the AT&amp;T Corporation's NCR computer division.</p>
        <p>Yet, some analysts give Mr. Passera at least even odds of succeeding in his strategy for Olivetti. "Don't underestimate their strong marketing skills," said Bill Coleman, an analyst at the brokerage house James Capel &amp; Company in London. "That's where Olivetti's skill and positioning is -- in distribution, marketing, and the positioning of its service." A Dynamic Duo</p>
        <p>Working in Mr. Passera's favor is the company's history and the strong advisory role still played by his mentor, Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's president and principal shareholder. Mr. De Benedetti, an international investor with major holdings in Italy, France and Spain, took control of Olivetti in 1978 and transformed it from a sleepy manufacturer of mechanical typewriters into one of Europe's leaders in office automation.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Benedetti, who is 59, remains "very much a part of strategic discussions," Mr. Passera said.</p>
        <p>The slight and boyish Mr. Passera, who is 39, was the upstart business school graduate, with degrees from Milan's Bocconi University and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, when he came to Mr. De Benedetti's attention in the early 1980's. At the time, Mr. Passera was earning high marks as a banking and finance consultant for McKinsey &amp; Company in Italy.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Benedetti brought him aboard as his personal assistant at the Compagnie Industriali Riunite holding group, with financial interests in electronics, retailing and other fields. There, Mr. Passera developed a reputation as a no-nonsense executive with an eye for detail -- just what Mr. De Benedetti decided was needed when he handed Mr. Passera the mess at Olivetti in 1992. Good 'Underlying Factors'</p>
        <p>Although Olivetti reports its financial results in the Italian currency, the lira, when the data are converted to dollars at the Dec. 31 exchange rate for each year, the numbers tell the following story:</p>
        <p>After eking out a profit of $53 million on sales of $8 billion in 1990, the company saw sales decline for two consecutive years, leading to losses of $403 million in 1991 and $440 million in 1992. Last year, the first full 12 months on Mr. Passera's watch, sales edged back up to $5 billion and the loss was reduced to $271 million.</p>
        <p>Investors have given Mr. Passera high marks, and Olivetti remains one of Italy's most widely held stocks. But the share price, which was at a 52-week high of 3,080 lire, or about $1.95, in April has lately been trading in the 2,400 range. Some brokerage firms, like Kleinwort-Benson in London, have Olivetti shares on their "take profit" list.</p>
        <p>"The underlying factors are good," said Fiona Marshall, a Kleinwort analyst who follows Olivetti. But she added that Olivetti has been promising a return to break-even for several years now, and investors may not want to wait to see if Mr. Passera's prediction this year is borne out.</p>
        <p>The mainstay of Olivetti's strategy is a network of alliances, most with the common goal of putting Olivetti more squarely in the world of telecommunications. Indeed, the move reflects the latest fashion in Europe's computer industry, where companies are following the American example of helping their computer customers set up local or long-distance networks capable of sending voice, data or images.</p>
        <p>Olivetti was actually one of the first to sniff the wind. In 1984, the company sold a 22 percent stake in its business to the AT&amp;T Corporation for $260 million. But the deal came "too early," according to Bruno Lamborghini, Olivetti's senior vice president for corporate strategy.</p>
        <p>The relationship soured in the late 1980's when AT&amp;T proposed acquiring all of Olivetti and Mr. De Benedetti turned down the offer. In 1989, AT&amp;T swapped its holdings in Olivetti for a $492 million stake in Compagnie Industriali Riunite, Mr. De Benedetti's holding company. Since then, AT&amp;T has been selling off its Industriali Riunite position little by little.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Passera, Olivetti turned to another big partner, the Digital Equipment Corporation, which acquired 10 percent of the Italian company in 1992 for about $300 million. Although the deal gave Olivetti access to Digital's technically advanced Alpha microchip technology, so far Digital has sold far fewer Alpha-based computers through Olivetti than expected.</p>
        <p>More recently, Olivetti has formed a joint venture with the Redgate Communication Corporation of Vero Beach, Fla., to develop an electronic catalogue that later this year is to enable shoppers in France to use home computers to obtain information in text, pictures and audio form about computer products offered for sale by various companies.</p>
        <p>In another recently formed venture, with Docunet, a California-based company, Olivetti intends to develop touch-screen vending machines for theaters, airports and travel agencies in the United States for selling tickets.</p>
        <p>But the real drive into telecommunications involves deals with big American communications companies. Olivetti is the lead partner in a group that includes Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis, which was authorized by the Italian Government in April to build Italy's second cellular telephone network. The network would compete directly with the cellular network operated by Italy's state-owned telephone company, Stet.</p>
        <p>Olivetti's digital cellular network, which will transmit voice and data in the binary pulses of computer code, is to begin service next year. Mr. Lamborghini says it will not only offer crystal-clear conversations through wireless phones but will also enable users of laptop computers to transmit large amounts of data virtually anywhere reachable by conventional land-line telephones.</p>
        <p>In June, Olivetti struck a deal with Hughes Network Systems to offer satellite communication systems in Europe using the small dish antennas that enable large corporations to distribute information among their big offices.</p>
        <p>Telecommunications in Europe, as deregulation strides forward, is a fast-growing business. But the frenzy of arrangements Olivetti has entered only serves to underscore the need to play catch-up in a quickly moving new business. Michael Grant, a telecommunications consultant in Cambridge, England, said that Olivetti was coming late to the field.</p>
        <p>"I'd be surprised if they made a success of it," Mr. Grant said. "There are a great number of players well down the route."  Going Up Against Giants</p>
        <p>Indeed, Olivetti is taking on some giants, as other European companies have also forged their own alliances with American carriers.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T has teamed with Unisource, a joint venture of the national phone operators in Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The MCI Communications Corporation recently received United States Justice Department approval to sell a 20 percent stake to BT (formerly British Telecom). And earlier this year, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom of Germany and France Telecom agreed to jointly spend $4.2 billion to acquire 20 percent of the Sprint Corporation.</p>
        <p>All the more reason, Mr. Passera said, for Olivetti to continue its own search for partnerships.</p>
        <p>"The times when a company could be engaged in everything from semiconductors to hardware to software are finished," Mr. Passera said. "There's a continuing need for alliances."  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY  Correction:  August 13, 1994, Saturday</p>
        <p>An article in Business Day on Aug. 3 about Olivetti S.p.A.'s efforts to enter the telecommunications business misidentified one of the company's American partners in developing a cellular telephone network in Italy. The partner is Airtouch Communications, not Pacific Telesis.</p>
