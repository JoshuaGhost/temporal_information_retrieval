        <p>Muslim militant preachers have condemned a United Nations population conference that is to be held here next month, prompting a private warning from Egyptian security agents to call off such sermons, a militant leader said here today.</p>
        <p>"Some brothers are preaching against this corrupt, immoral conference in the mosques," said the leader, an important militant figure in Imbaba, a poor section of Cairo that is the city's biggest fundamentalist stronghold. "But others may decide to defend Islam by killing, and they would be willing to die in the process. If the West is afraid of blood, it should stay away from us." He spoke on condition that he not be identified.</p>

        <p>Muslim militant preachers have condemned a United Nations population conference that is to be held here next month, prompting a private warning from Egyptian security agents to call off such sermons, a militant leader said here today.</p>
        <p>"Some brothers are preaching against this corrupt, immoral conference in the mosques," said the leader, an important militant figure in Imbaba, a poor section of Cairo that is the city's biggest fundamentalist stronghold. "But others may decide to defend Islam by killing, and they would be willing to die in the process. If the West is afraid of blood, it should stay away from us." He spoke on condition that he not be identified.</p>
        <p>The International Conference for Population and Development on Sept. 5-13 will cover a number of subjects that are considered offensive or controversial in parts of the Muslim world, including abortion, family planning and adolescent sexuality. Ideas Stir Indignation</p>
        <p>Such ideas have stirred indignation among Islamic militants who are waging a violent campaign to topple Egypt's secular Government and install a strict Islamic state.</p>
        <p>The country's most active and violent militant organizations, the Islamic Group and Al Jihad, have not condemned the conference or threatened violence. And many of their members, including key leaders, have been captured or killed in shootouts, Interior Ministry officials say.</p>
        <p>But for the last month, militant preachers have delivered fiery sermons denouncing the conference as an American and Israeli attempt to dominate the Islamic world by spreading Western immorality, the militant leader said.</p>
        <p>He said Egyptian security agents had warned him on Sunday night to call off any additional sermons condemning the conference. But he said fervor against the conference was strong among Muslim militants and could unleash a wave of political violence by the more radical groups.</p>
        <p>The conference, expected to draw as many as 20,000 participants, has already drawn criticism from moderate Islamic quarters like the Muslim Brotherhood, opposition newspapers and Al Azhar Islamic University, the world's most prestigious institution of Islamic learning. Population and Poverty</p>
        <p>The conference will address ways to deal with the world's rapidly growing population as well as with hunger and poverty. Al Azhar has complained that the draft agenda for the conference is loosely worded in such a way that it appears to contradict Islamic principles banning extramarital sex and abortions in cases where the woman's life is not in danger.</p>
        <p>But it is the radical militant groups that pose the greatest threat to the Government of President Hosni Mubarak, which has only recently begun to contain a wave of violence that has killed more than 400 people, including 4 foreign tourists, since March 1992.</p>
        <p>An attack during the conference could derail the Government's campaign to put its vital tourist industry on track and prove to the world that Egypt is still a safe place to visit.</p>
        <p>On Sunday night, hundreds of worshipers, many of them bearded and in white robes, gathered for several hours at a large mosque in Imbaba as a preacher scathingly criticized the conference. "We reject this conference," said the preacher, whose words echoed through the neighborhood over a loudspeaker. "It is a Zionist and imperialist assault against Islam. This is a policy imposed on Egypt by the United States."</p>
        <p>The militant leader said it would be in the interest of fundamentalist groups not to carry out attacks, so they could prove they are not terrorists. But he speculated that the most hard-line groups might try to seize on the opportunity to deal another blow to the Government. "There are going to be 20,000 people from the conference walking around Cairo," he said. "An operative from a group could walk in blind and still injure somebody."</p>
        <p>The militants have gunned down Government officials, police officers, Coptic Christians and foreign visitors as part of their campaign. But the crackdown, including a series of police raids and mass arrests, have sharply reduced political violence during the last few months.</p>
        <p>Today the Government hanged five militants for trying to kill the Interior Minister a year ago, and the police shot three others in gun battles in southern Egypt.</p>
        <p>The crackdown has also coincided with stepped-up security measures to prevent further attacks against foreigners. Hotels and many restaurants are equipped with metal detectors. Foreigners traveling in southern Egypt, where most of the violence has taken place, are escorted by police vehicles.</p>
        <p>The State Department has issued a brochure with safety tips for Americans attending the conference, advising them, for example, to avoid predictable routines like jogging at the same time each day or dining each night at the same restaurant.</p>
        <p>Without giving specifics, the Egyptian Government has tried to reassure participants that it is taking all steps necessary to insure their safety.</p>
        <p>Dianne Sherman, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Network for Cairo, a coalition of more than 200 organizations concerned with population-related issues including family planning, said she was not aware of any cancellations arising from fear of violence, though she was sure that "there are some people with butterflies."</p>
