        <p>From their living rooms to the barber shops, New York's Haitians spent yesterday passionately discussing the United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing a United States-led invasion of Haiti if the country's military leaders do not leave voluntarily.</p>
        <p>While voicing some misgivings, supporters of the ousted President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, said that they would back any action if it unseated the junta, which seized power in September 1991.</p>
        <p>"It's true that no one hopes that there would be an intervention in Haiti," said Jean Wesnel, of Flatbush. "But we have reached a crossroads. The military has caused too much suffering."</p>
        <p>In recent months, President Clinton and other Administration officials have refused to rule out using force to remove the army leader, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, and his allies.</p>
        <p>But Sunday's Security Council vote did not set a date for an invasion. Administration officials are hoping that tough economic sanctions will push General Cedras out of power.</p>
        <p>"One way or another he has to go," said Roger St. Lot, of Laurelton, Queens. "I don't know what the United States is waiting for. Cedras has shown that he will not leave voluntarily."</p>
        <p>Haitians remember all too well that United States marines landed there in 1915 and stayed until 1934.</p>
        <p>"I don't support an invasion," said Guy Etienne of Crown Heights. "This problem should be solved by Haitians with the help of the international community. No one who controls you has your best interest in mind."</p>
        <p>The Haitians' gingerly support for military action reflects that of Father Aristide, who has changed his stance on military force on many occasions.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, at M &amp; S Record Shop on Nostrand Avenue in Crown Heights a group of men milled about inside while others sat in front playing dominoes, talking about the politics of the homeland between each move.</p>
        <p>"If an invasion happens, it will be better than what these guys are doing right now," said Jacques Angrand, manager of the store.</p>
        <p>"It's just two guys holding the country hostage," added Toto Patou, about General Cedras and the police chief, Lieut. Col. Joseph Michel Francois. "They have to go by any means necessary."</p>
