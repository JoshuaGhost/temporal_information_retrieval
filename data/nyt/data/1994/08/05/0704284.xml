        <p>I.B.M.'s Collection</p>
        <p>The belt-tightening continues at I.B.M. While the company hasn't formally announced it, Tracy O'Neill, an I.B.M. spokeswoman, confirmed this week that Sotheby's would sell at least some of I.B.M.'s extensive collection of North American and Latin American art. The auction house declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The reason the news has been kept so quiet is that I.B.M. hasn't decided if it will sell the entire collection, which experts estimate could be worth $40 million to $100 million. The core consists of about a dozen masterworks by such American artists as Edward Hopper, Childe Hassam, Winslow Homer and George Bellows. I.B.M. has strong Latin American holdings, including paintings by Rufino Tamayo, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.</p>

        <p>I.B.M.'s Collection</p>
        <p>The belt-tightening continues at I.B.M. While the company hasn't formally announced it, Tracy O'Neill, an I.B.M. spokeswoman, confirmed this week that Sotheby's would sell at least some of I.B.M.'s extensive collection of North American and Latin American art. The auction house declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The reason the news has been kept so quiet is that I.B.M. hasn't decided if it will sell the entire collection, which experts estimate could be worth $40 million to $100 million. The core consists of about a dozen masterworks by such American artists as Edward Hopper, Childe Hassam, Winslow Homer and George Bellows. I.B.M. has strong Latin American holdings, including paintings by Rufino Tamayo, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.</p>
        <p>The collection is in two parts: contemporary works that line the walls of I.B.M.'s many offices, and its "historical collection" of art bought by Thomas Watson, the company's founder, in the 1930's and 40's. Even though I.B.M. had its own Manhattan art gallery on Madison Avenue and 56th Street, which closed last month when I.B.M. sold the building, most of the historical works have been sitting in storage, running up a big bill.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's is reportedly selling some I.B.M. works in its fall sales in New York, but the bulk of the collection is expected to be auctioned next year. Both Sotheby's and Christie's gave their standard presentations and submitted proposals to I.B.M. The company declined to comment on why it chose Sotheby's to auction the collection. But American art experts say there were three main reasons: Sotheby's has a larger share of the American art market than Christie's; it made a more aggressive pitch, not only to auction the art but to manage it until I.B.M. was ready to sell, and -- perhaps crucial to a company like I.B.M. -- Sotheby's uses I.B.M. equipment. Christie's does not. Whitney Still Hopes to Grow</p>
        <p>Even though the Whitney Museum of American Art abandoned the elaborate addition plan designed by the architect Michael Graves, it hasn't given up the notion of expanding. But this time the museum is moving slowly.</p>
        <p>Last week, it paid $3.4 million for a six-story brownstone at 33 East 74th Street in Manhattan, around the corner from the museum, which was designed in 1966 by Marcel Breuer. The new building will become the Whitney's office annex and house its library and archives. "Over the next two months we will be determining how much of the administration we can transfer, potentially freeing up space for additional exhibitions," said David A. Ross, the director. "In the early fall, once the studies are complete, we will be able to put forth a broader master plan for expansion over the next three to five years."</p>
        <p>Richard Gluckman, an architect who has designed many SoHo galleries and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, will conduct the study. Mr. Gluckman just completed a $500,000 renovation of the Whitney's lobby. Mr. Ross said: "Many people can't even tell anything was done. It looks so much like Breuer." The Alexander's Site</p>
        <p>There's a lot of whispering going on in Sotheby's halls and back offices this summer. Everyone's talking about the fact that negotiations are heating up between Sotheby's and Steve Roth, the New Jersey developer whose company, Interstate Properties, holds the controlling interest in Alexander's, including the company's former building at Lexington Avenue and 58th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A move there by Sotheby's from its headquarters on York Avenue and 72d Street, its Manhattan home for the last 14 years, would mean the company could put its entire operation under one roof. Art is currently stored in a string of warehouses around New York City, and the real-estate division works out of the old Parke-Bernet building on Madison Avenue and 76th Street. In addition to housing Sotheby's at the base of the 58th Street building, the deal is believed to include plans to construct an office or residential tower above.</p>
        <p>While all the parties declined to comment this week, it's the type of deal that Sotheby's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, is a master at negotiating. As Mr. Taubman, the real-estate magnate, knows better than most, location is everything. To be at 58th Street and Lexington Avenue would mean attracting many more impulse shoppers than can be enticed to Sotheby's current address so far on the Upper East Side. And the auction house would be just a sneeze away from its archrival, Christie's, at Park Avenue and 59th Street.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's would also be near such art meccas as the gallery-filled Fuller Building, on 57th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, and several newly situated decorative-art galleries.</p>
        <p>The newest tenant to migrate to the neighborhood is the Chinese Porcelain Company. Its owner, Khalil Rizk, has announced that after 10 years at Madison Avenue and 69th Street, he is moving his gallery to the site on Park Avenue and 58th Street long occupied by the dress shop Martha, which closed in May 1993. The new 4,500-square-foot gallery will triple the company's space and allow for a doubling of the staff.</p>
        <p>Conor Mahony, a 16-year veteran of Sotheby's who was a director of Chinese works of art for the auction house in both London and New York, will become the president of Chinese Porcelain. "We're planning to offer the entire range of Chinese decorative arts, as well as some European furniture," Mr. Rizk said. The gallery will open its new space on Oct. 12 with a show of Cambodian sculpture.  Italian Renaissance</p>
        <p>Although some traveling exhibitions involve unusually tricky logistics, the headaches can be worth it, at least to big institutions like the National Gallery of Art in Washington. This week it announced it would import "Italian Renaissance Architecture: Brunelleschi to Michelangelo," one of the most comprehensive exhibitions ever held on Renaissance architecture. The show, which is closed until Aug. 18, will run through Nov. 6 at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice.</p>
        <p>"We're getting a modified version," said Earl A. Powell 3d, the National Gallery's director. "But basically it's the heart and soul of the exhibition." The show will be on view in Washington from Dec. 18 through April 16, 1995.</p>
        <p>While many of the drawings on view in Venice will not travel, for conservation reasons, three of the most important wooden architectural models surviving from the Italian Renaissance will come here. These are no small trinkets. The model of St Peter's, dating from 1539-1546, by the architect Antonio da Sangallo, measures about 24 feet long, 19.5 feet wide and nearly 15 feet high.</p>
        <p>"It's a large and complex packing project," said Mr. Powell. "About 70-plus crates, which for some museums is a show in itself."</p>
