        <p>A woman who collected welfare under 15 different names and for 73 fictitious children pleaded guilty yesterday in a Manhattan courtroom to grand larceny. She faces three to six years in prison.</p>
        <p>The woman, Shirley Simmons, stunned investigators when they learned the extent of her deception, which was uncovered by an investigator for the State Department who found discrepancies in her application for a passport.</p>
        <p>Ms. Simmons, investigators found, used a wide variety of methods to defraud the Human Resources Administration of more than $450,000 from 1987 to 1994. She deceived one welfare office after another with a collection of fake or stolen documents for herself and her imaginary children, including 11 sets of twins.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors determined that she was born Shirley Patricia Barker in Guyana in December 1946, took the name Simmons when she married, and lived on Rogers Avenue in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. She is now divorced. Mother of Five</p>
        <p>She actually has five children, three in the United States, for whom she once collected welfare legally, one in Trinidad and one in Barbados, each of whose names she used to collect welfare payments improperly.</p>
        <p>Sarah Moody Mariani, an assistant district attorney in Manhattan prosecuting the case, said it was not entirely clear what Ms. Simmons did with the money she stole. No significant amounts of money were found in the bank accounts that Ms. Simmons had opened under various names, Ms. Mariani said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mariani said that no evidence was found to indicate that Ms. Simmons had been helped in her misdeeds by any corrupt officials of the Human Resources Administration. Ms. Simmons provided a detailed account of which welfare offices were easier to deceive than others, Ms. Mariani said. Such fraud will be difficult to repeat after electronic fingerprinting is introduced for welfare recipients, Ms. Mariani said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plans to set up a system for fingerprinting in all five boroughs by next May. It is intended to eliminate fraud by requiring all applicants for public assistance to allow an electronic scanner to record the lines on an index finger into a computer's memory.</p>
        <p>In court yesterday, Ms. Simmons agreed to repay eventually $50,000 of the money she stole, signing over 10 percent of any public assistance she receives after she completes her prison term. She is to be sentenced on Aug. 29.</p>
