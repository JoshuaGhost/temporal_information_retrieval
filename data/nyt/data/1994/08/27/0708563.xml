        <p>The 126th season of racing at Saratoga turned into its final weekend today with seven senior horses entered in the $350,000 Whitney Handicap, a prelude to the fall races that will decide who is the Horse of the Year.</p>
        <p>The Whitney will be run on Saturday with an all-star cast racing a mile and one-eighth. Devil His Due is a slight favorite to withstand the dramatic comeback staged at Saratoga this month by Thunder Rumble.</p>
        <p>Both will be tested by some old rivals, notably Colonial Affair, West by West and Williamstown. And the best of the bunch will go on to the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park three weeks later, when they will be joined by two of the leading 3-year-old colts of 1994: Go for Gin, winner of the Kentucky Derby, and Holy Bull, winner of the Travers Stakes and six other major races in the last six months. Zito Is Adamant</p>
        <p>In fact, a war of words was building along the backstretch both here at Saratoga and at Monmouth Park in New Jersey, the home base for Holy Bull. It started this week after Go for Gin skipped the Travers and ran third in the Forego Handicap in his prep race for the Woodward.</p>
        <p>"We're going to run in the Woodward," said Nick Zito, who trains the Derby winner. "We can't hide. We have to get the Bull and slay him. We're stabled at Belmont, we train at Belmont and on Sept. 17 -- win, lose or draw -- we'll be there."</p>
        <p>Jimmy Croll, who owns and trains Holy Bull, watched his star gallop this morning at Monmouth, and said: "He's better than ever." Croll Is Angry</p>
        <p>Then he reacted angrily to suggestions that he was ducking the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 5 because he didn't want to pay $360,000 as the supplemental fee to enter Holy Bull. Through his own oversight two years ago, Croll failed to nominate the colt for the Breeders' Cup. And he has said repeatedly that he would close his horse's season with the Woodward and not push him into a defining race against Go for Gin and Tabasco Cat, winner of the Preakness and Belmont Stakes.</p>
        <p>"They can scream all they want," he said, "but I'm doing what's best for the horse. If someone came to me and said they'd put up the $360,000, I still wouldn't run him in the Breeders' Cup."</p>
        <p>"I hope all those other horses don't run in the Woodward," he said. "Just make sure that Zito runs in it. Everyone's got a lot to say about me not putting up the money for the Breeders' Cup. Just make sure Go for Gin's there." FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Even in the dwindling days at Saratoga, the long shots thrive. In the Seneca Handicap, the favorites didn't get there, but Dinner in Rio did at 12-1. He ran down JULIE KRONE and Pascagani as they turned for home, beat back a late push by Irish Approach and won by a neck. Then it was Irish Approach and five lengths back to Asserche. The winner, owned by DANIEL BORISLOW and trained by JOHN SCANLAN, ran the mile and five-eighths on the turf in 2:444/5 under MIKE SMITH and paid $27. . . . Arlington Park outside Chicago will open its richest weekend on Saturday with the $500,000 Beverly D. for fillies and mares. The big matchup: Flawlessly, the daughter of Affirmed who has won $2.5 million while winning 16 of 27 starts, faces England's celebrated mare User Friendly. And on Sunday, for a purse of $1 million, Paradise Creek and Star of Cozzene will head an international field of turf stars in the Arlington Million.  HORSE RACING</p>
