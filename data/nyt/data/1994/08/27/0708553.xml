        <p>Stone Temple Pilots barely had to sing their songs tonight at the Jones Beach Theater. The audience did it for them, on their feet, happily joining in with every word from the band's two multimillion-selling albums, "Core" and "Purple" (Atlantic). They were songs about sullen self-pity shading into anger, about feeling aimless and resentful and wondering, "Where ya going to tomorrow?" Verses seethed with dissonance; then choruses shifted to comforting melodies.</p>
        <p>Many of the fans wore flannel shirts that looked as if they were fresh from the mall. Wrapped in the emblems of ready-made, mass-marketed grunge, they were a fine sartorial match for Stone Temple Pilots' music. Stone Temple Pilots played knockoffs of the lunging riffs and asymmetrical melodies of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden; their uptempo songs, like "Unglued," echoed Nirvana. For variety, a few songs foraged outside Seattle, imitating Jack Bruce in "Big Empty" and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in "Lounge Fly." "Guess I like to steal," Scott Weiland sang in "Creep," and while the character in the song is a sociopath, the line rang true.</p>

        <p>Stone Temple Pilots barely had to sing their songs tonight at the Jones Beach Theater. The audience did it for them, on their feet, happily joining in with every word from the band's two multimillion-selling albums, "Core" and "Purple" (Atlantic). They were songs about sullen self-pity shading into anger, about feeling aimless and resentful and wondering, "Where ya going to tomorrow?" Verses seethed with dissonance; then choruses shifted to comforting melodies.</p>
        <p>Many of the fans wore flannel shirts that looked as if they were fresh from the mall. Wrapped in the emblems of ready-made, mass-marketed grunge, they were a fine sartorial match for Stone Temple Pilots' music. Stone Temple Pilots played knockoffs of the lunging riffs and asymmetrical melodies of Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden; their uptempo songs, like "Unglued," echoed Nirvana. For variety, a few songs foraged outside Seattle, imitating Jack Bruce in "Big Empty" and the Red Hot Chili Peppers in "Lounge Fly." "Guess I like to steal," Scott Weiland sang in "Creep," and while the character in the song is a sociopath, the line rang true.</p>
        <p>The mimicry is blatant, the band adequate. Outside the studio, Mr. Weiland's voice was weaker than that of Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder, and the band's attack fell short of both the precision of Pearl Jam and the ferocious passion of Nirvana. But the songs are crafty. The music, written by Robert DeLeo (who plays bass) and Dean DeLeo (guitar), has more melodic interludes than many of its grunge sources, and Mr. Weiland's lyrics move into the pop territory of romance, most of it tortured.</p>
        <p>Allusive non sequiturs are part of the grunge formula, but Stone Temple Pilots also give their fans straightforward lines to shout: "I got this feeling coming over me," "Sell me down the river" or "You lied -- goodbye." They also link the existential malaise of Seattle grunge to a less intellectual gripe: sexual frustration. "Sex Type Thing," the concert's last encore, is the monologue of a rapist, who snarls, "Ya shouldn't have worn that dress." The band has insisted there is ironic distance in the song, but the crowd sang along wholeheartedly.</p>
        <p>Stone Temple Pilots performed below purple-velvet swags, flanked by giant video simulations of lava lamps. During an acoustic-instruments section of the concert, they sat on plush living-room furniture and sang David Bowie's "Andy Warhol," praising the Pop artist's superficial imagery. The staging suggests that Stone Temple Pilots are suburban kitsch; that's one image the band lives up to.</p>
        <p>To certify Stone Temple Pilots as alternative rock, the band brought two opening acts from the collegiate circuit. The Meat Puppets, from Phoenix, have been knocking around for more than a decade, drifting between punk-rock and countryish songs with a whiff of the Grateful Dead. Curt Kirkwood, on guitar, and Cris Kirkwood, on bass, sing articulate lyrics about obliviousness and uncertainty; the band's long-awaited hit, "Backwater," is an offhanded song of utter desperation. On stage, the band has added a second guitarist to its longtime trio lineup, but it was still wry and nimble, hampered only by a bass-heavy sound mix.</p>
        <p>Jawbox, from Washington, opened the concert with jumpy, asymmetrical songs, built from shards of punk rock, funk and the Police. J. Robbins and Bill Barbot, on guitars, sang in harried average-guy voices; the oblique, edgy lyrics railed against the combination of too much information and too little meaning: "Awash in the signs, sick from the lack." The songs are crammed with changes, as if any breathing space would be a waste of time, and the band's noisy, meticulous virtuosity made listeners agree.</p>
