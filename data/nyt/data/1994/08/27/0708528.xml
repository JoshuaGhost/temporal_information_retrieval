        <p>The thousands of people who crowded into this eastern town for a rock concert in early August came not only to hear the Puhdys, once the most popular band in East Germany, but also to revel in their East German past.</p>
        <p>Axel Badura, whose home is near the open-air arena here, watched from his window as concertgoers streamed by. He wasn't surprised by the turnout.</p>
        <p>"Part of the appeal is that people want to hear the music they grew up with, but that isn't the whole explanation," Mr. Badura said. "People are saying that not everything in East Germany was bad.</p>
        <p>"In the old days we didn't have a crime problem, we didn't have traffic jams, we didn't have trouble finding kindergarten places for our kids, and nobody had to worry about being thrown out of work. For a while after unification, people were ashamed to admit that they had grown up in East Germany, but now we're starting to be proud of it."</p>
        <p>At the concert, the distinctive aromas of Cabinet and F6 cigarettes, which were popular in East Germany and are still made in Saxony and Thuringia, hung over the crowd. Vendors did a brisk business in T-shirts bearing old advertisements for East German products ranging from detergents to tampons.</p>
        <p>A wave of nostalgia for the era of Communist rule is speading across eastern Germany. For many people, it does not reflect a desire to return to the repressive old days, but rather a growing sense of self-confidence.</p>
        <p>That feeling is clearly on display at dozens of stores that specialize in local products, which are proudly advertised with slogans like "Beer From Here" and "East-Made."</p>
        <p>Many easterners say they have stopped trying to like the dry white wines popular in the west and have returned to the sweet reds with which they grew up. They are also buying their familiar mild mustard again instead of the sharper brands favored in the west.</p>
        <p>At vacation time, easterners no longer automatically follow their western cousins. Travel agents in eastern cities say that bookings for trips to Tunisia and the Canary Islands, which are popular among West Germans, have fallen sharply, while tours to eastern destinations like Romania and Bulgaria are often sold out. Some travelers even use their old East German passports, many of which are valid until the end of 1995.</p>
        <p>"It's medicine against a disease they brought on themselves, which is shattered self-confidence and loss of identity," said Monika Maron, a prominent writer who left East Germany in 1988. "Now anyone who eats mustard from Bautzen or bratwurst from Thuringia can feel like a resistance fighter."</p>
        <p>Some celebrations of the East German past are meant as satire, like the theme parties that are increasingly popular at night clubs and colleges. At these parties, giant photos of Erich Honecker and other deposed Communist leaders hang on the walls. Visitors are often admitted free if they wear the blue blouses that once marked them as members of the Communist youth group.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most visible symbol of East Germany was the Trabant, a smelly, slow-moving car that is no longer built. In the euphoria of German unification, many easterners couldn't wait to dump their Trabants, abandoning them by the hundreds along back roads. But now they are collectors' items.</p>
        <p>Many Trabis, as they were known, are now seen decorated in bright colors that were unavailable in East Germany. One Berlin mechanic, Harald Erpel, has split a Trabi in half and welded an American-made limousine into the middle. He rents his unique coach, complete with chauffeur, television and mini-bar, for parties and weddings.</p>
        <p>"Business is booming," he said. "The Trabi is beloved like never before."</p>
        <p>Nostalgia for East Germany also has a serious side, reflected most clearly in the revival of the Communist Party. Party leaders have found that campaigns stressing the positive aspects of East German life and faulting westerners for arrogantly refusing to acknowledge them pay off handsomely at the polls.</p>
        <p>Eastern politicians from other parties also seek to encourage a sense of indigenous self-confidence. One of the region's most popular figures, Regine Hildebrandt, who is responsible for social policy in Brandenburg, likes to tell audiences, "We're someone again." And when Rainer Eppelmann, a former dissident who is now a member of Parliament, is asked what was good about East Germany, he replies simply, "Us."</p>
        <p>However the new nostalgia is expressed, it reflects easterners' desire not to lose contact with the life they lived for decades before the Berlin wall was breached in 1989.</p>
        <p>"We East Germans believed that we lived better than anyone else in the Eastern bloc," said the historian and essayist Gunter de Bruyn. "Then when unification came, we were told that everything we produced was junk. That hurt, and it activated anti-western prejudices bred into us by years of anti-capitalist propaganda."</p>
        <p>"A legend is growing that holds that if the west hadn't deluded our people and forced unification on us, everything could have been beautiful," he reflected. "When you hear that, you can only have the nasty wish that West Germany had let our bankrupt country stew in its juices for a while longer so that no one would ever be able to believe such a legend."</p>
