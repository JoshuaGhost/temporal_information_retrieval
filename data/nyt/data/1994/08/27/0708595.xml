        <p>Midnight finally arrived this week for the Cinderella team in the Von Zedtwitz Double Knockout Team Championship.</p>
        <p>Playing in the final on Tuesday at Honors Club, 42 East 74th Street, the team, headed by Jerry Goldberg of Yonkers, and including Bob Jaffe, Nancy Kalow, Jane Dillenberg and Jeff Rothstein, all of Long Island City, Queens, seemed poised to take the title. In earlier rounds, it had upset several much more experienced teams, and with nine deals remaining they led by 16 imps.</p>
        <p>The deciding deal in the final stage is shown in the diagram. The South cards were held by the captain of the opposing team, Claire Tornay of Manhattan, who has long been active as both player and organizer. She is a former president of the Greater New York Bridge Association, a former president of the Cavendish Club, and is the chief organizer of the Israel Cancer Research Fund game to be played Sept. 12. (For information call (212) 969-9800.)</p>
        <p>After an opening weak two-heart bid by West, one might expect East to raise to game. Four hearts succeeds easily, and can make an overtrick, but South would probably bid four spades. Both East players, however, chose to bid two no-trump, and South was able to bid three spades.</p>
        <p>Against Mrs. Tornay, East chose to double three spades, a dubious decision. West led the heart ace, and shifted to a trump with the idea of stopping a club ruff. This defense might well have succeeded if East's club had included the nine, but as it was, South led clubs from her hand and could not be defeated.</p>
        <p>Notice that the defense would have done no better if West had continued a heart at the second trick or shifted to a diamond. By working on clubs South will still emerge with nine tricks whatever the defense.</p>
        <p>In the replay, East bid four hearts in preference to doubling three spades, and East-West scored a game. The double game swing gave Mrs. Tornay's team 14 imps, and when all the deals had been compared, she and her teammates, George Tornay, John Roberts, Judy Tucker, all of Manhattan, Tom Smith of Greenwich, Conn., and Gene Saxe of Stamford, Conn., had won the title by just 2 imps.</p>
