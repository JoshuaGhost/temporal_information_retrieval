        <p>Roger Comstock drove at 135 miles per hour past police officers who did absolutely nothing to stop him.</p>
        <p>But then, this was the East Coast Cop Car Nationals, a drag-racing championship that gives law-enforcement officers bragging rights to the fastest vehicles over a quarter-mile strip while speeding the war against drug and alcohol abuse by the young.</p>
        <p>The second annual competition, held at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park, was open to active or retired police officers who are involved in drug- and alcohol-awareness programs.</p>
        <p>About 75 competitors from 50 law-enforcement departments participated, all on their own time. Most were from New Jersey and New York, but some from as far away as Ohio and Florida. They raced in several categories, including "top cop," full-bodied, full-engined race cars decorated to simulate police vehicles; "duty cop," regular patrol vehicles, and "motor cop," motorcycles.</p>
        <p>The hundreds of young people and families in attendance got a close look at the cars, and came away with a message.</p>
        <p>"You can stand behind a podium and say 'Just say no' until you're blue in the face," said Sgt. Jim Davis of the Ocean County Department of Corrections. "We can engage them in conversation about the car. It makes you more approachable and reachable." Little Triumphs</p>
        <p>Sergeant Davis, who supervises work-release and work-crew programs, has been racing since 1979. He is frequently invited to speak at schools and brings his race car, a 1966 Plymouth Belvedere, which produces 450 horsepower and lots of rapport. Once this rapport has been established, Sergeant Davis said, he can deliver his message about making responsible decisions in life.</p>
        <p>Sometimes his presentations do more than inform youngsters about drinking, drugs or illegal street racing. At one elementary school, Sergeant Davis mentioned the car's onboard computer and miniaturized weather station, which allow carburetor adjustments for atmospheric conditions on race day. He later learned that one pupil had been so intrigued by the comment that the boy developed a keen interest in meteorology.</p>
        <p>"You get these little triumphs where you can find them," Sergeant Davis said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Comstock, the defending champion in the top-cop category and a former California narcotics agent, was here with his 500-horsepower 1969 Pontiac Firebird, which found plenty of admirers. "I've probably talked to 200 kids today," he said. "Whether the car wins or not, that's successful."</p>
