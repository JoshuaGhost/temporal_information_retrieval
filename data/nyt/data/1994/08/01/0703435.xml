        <p>Mostly Mozart's attempts at theme concerts last summer had a thrown-together quality. Making music against a background of wider artistic, literary and social contexts needs the preparation and thought these events did not receive. This year the festival has lowered its sights. Ideas of time and place remain but in simpler terms. This past week at Avery Fisher Hall, for example, has centered on Mozart's extraordinary outburst of piano concertos in 1784. On Thursday, the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra under Gerard Schwarz offered three of the six. Under Armin Jordan on Friday, a fourth was played.</p>
        <p>The concept works: one notes both astonishing variety and shared tendencies. Each of the four was a world to itself, yet in the piano detail and harmonic gestures lay a recognizable mind. The performers were as various as the pieces. All professional pianists learn music's vocabulary of expression, but Helene Grimaud, who played the F-major Concerto (No. 19, K. 459) on Thursday, showed emotions of her own, her heart speaking acutely and specifically with every depression of the keys. Miss Grimaud's quiet playing is especially effective, yet paradoxically, it is slimness of sonority that creates her principal problem: a sound so slight that it almost disappears within the orchestra around her.</p>
        <p>With her elegant, emotionally static delivery in the E-flat Concerto (No. 14, K. 449), Cecile Licad was more a spokeswoman for style in general. Every emotional gesture was in place but seemed borrowed, not generated from within. In flailing contrast was Robert Levin in the D-major Concerto (No. 16, K. 451).</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin is at heart an interesting musician, but the mugging and arm-waving get in the listener's way and in his. A little calmness might help the jumpy quality of his passagework; it also might let audiences concentrate on Mozart. Yet Mr. Levin's ideas and technique are sound. He improvises cadenzas (in 18th-century language) and likes to thump along on the keyboard during orchestra tuttis. I hope he was in the hall on Friday to hear Menahem Pressler's dignified musicianship in Mozart's G-major Concerto (No. 17, K. 453).</p>
        <p>Mr. Jordan conducted Haydn's D-minor Symphony (No. 80) savoring its alternations of droll interruption and touching sentiment. He also accompanied the Haydn D-major Cello Concerto, which Ralph Kirshbaum smothered with affection. This was a performance at best warmly impetuous, at worst roughshod. Mr. Schwarz's work with this orchestra is known; Mr. Jordan has the quick-study technique to make it play almost equally as well. The worst loss if Mostly Mozart dies, as a few people think it will, would be these players, who somehow remain alert and graceful under heavy schedules. There were happy listeners as far as the eye could see on Thursday. Friday was a little thinner at the back and at the sides upstairs but for a Friday weekend-getaway audience not bad at all.
