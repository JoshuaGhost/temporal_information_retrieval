        <p>THIS has been a good year for geraniums. In spite of midsummer heat and humidity, the showy plants are strutting their stuff in window boxes, patio pots and tubs, flower borders and tidy borders around the bases of flagpoles.</p>
        <p>The plants in question, with their handsome leaves and spectacular blooms, are what botanists call pelargoniums, not to be confused with hardy perennial geraniums.</p>
        <p>Pelargoniums belong to the big geranium family, however, and are sometimes called cranesbills. Most of them had their start in South Africa, which is home to many species.</p>
        <p>Plant breeders worldwide have taken pelargoniums to heart and worked with them diligently for several years.</p>
        <p>The result?</p>
        <p>Geraniums are now almost as popular and durable as other well-known bedding plants, particularly petunias and impatiens.</p>
        <p>The plant breeders set as some of their goals better colors, less shattering of blossoms, earlier flowering and plant durability.</p>
        <p>And their efforts have meant modern geraniums have reached new highs in variety as well as durability. In color variations alone there are deep reds, oranges, pinks, salmons, violets and whites or blends.</p>
        <p>Thus far the only colors lacking are blues or yellows, which may not be worth the breeders' efforts because there are so many other favorite summer flowers in these shades already. To keep it as simple as possible, geraniums have been broken down into four main types.</p>
        <p>The best known and most widely grown is the zonal geranium, so called because the leaves have obvious zonal markings. Flower heads are large clusters or umbels that can be gloriously showy. These geraniums combine extremely well with petunias and are often paired with them in tubs and containers.</p>
        <p>Zonal geraniums can now be grown from seed and this fact has been a great production boom for suppliers. It has also made a reduction in price possible, and the geranium has become something that can be used in quantity.</p>
        <p>Ivy geraniums, a second type, are hybrids, improvements of the old-fashioned Pelargonium peltatum. This is the hanging basket geranium that thrives in European countries and spills over the window boxes. The leaves are ivy-shape, softer green with a waxy sheen. The flowers are often bicolored -- white and red -- which makes them particularly handsome.</p>
        <p>A third type, the scented geraniums, is not showy but rather the sort of plant that collectors like to gather for its aroma. The plants are often rather gangly, but the leaves when rubbed offer hints of nutmeg, rose, coconut, peppermint, apple or lemon, to name a few.</p>
        <p>Sometimes people tuck a few of these leaves in linen closets and some cooks have used certain scented geraniums for flavoring.</p>
        <p>The most beautiful type, but the most difficult geranium to grow, is the Regal or Martha Washington geranium.</p>
        <p>This particular variety thrives in the cool spring weather when it can show off its large and often double-petaled flowers. Some blooms are even bicolored with contrasting stripes. The leaves are crinkled and decorative. But as soon as the evenings become warm, above 60 degrees, this geranium resists flowering.</p>
        <p>This sort of cultural requirement is fine in the more northerly states, but devastating where the summers are hot. Plant breeders are working on this aspect of the regals and Europeans have reported some success. By utilizing some of the best traits of certain regal types, there is hope that some of the problems can be solved in future years.</p>
        <p>The geranium has come a long way in its transition from a South African plant to a worldwide citizen. The first geraniums were taken to the Netherlands in the late 17th and early 18th century.</p>
        <p>But the geranium was unknown in this country until 1786 when Thomas Jefferson sent some plants to John Bartram in Philadelphia. Hybridizing proceeded from that time on. A five-volume treatise on geraniums was written by Robert Sweet.</p>
        <p>Although geraniums have come to be practically carefree, there are a few important cultural points to be made.</p>
        <p>Most important, the faded, blackened flowers must be snapped off regularly to prevent disease. Also, the plants are not heavy feeders and if they are fertilized too often, there will be plenty of leaves but few flowers. Geraniums need not be starved.</p>
        <p>Applications of a water-soluble fertilizer once or twice during a season is fine. But overwatering can encourage disease.</p>
        <p>Be sure that the plants have good aeration. Prune back floppy and unwieldy stems when needed.</p>
        <p>And if a particular geranium has a pleasing color or shape, it can be potted up and moved indoors for winter flowers, provided the plant is kept in a cool but sunny window.  GARDENING</p>
