        <p>During the 50-day strike in 1981, Raymond Grebey, the owners' chief negotiator, adopted a mantra to try to show how foolish the owners believed the players were in not accepting their proposal. "We now have a strike over the rights of 11 players," Grebey would say, reducing the number every few days.</p>
        <p>Thirteen years later, baseball may have a strike because the owners don't trust one another.</p>
        <p>"When you begin to examine what they're saying," Donald Fehr, the players' labor leader, said yesterday, "it becomes obvious the positions they take don't have much to do with the underlying causes of the problems they say they want to solve. There is a strike because they can't solve their internal disputes to their satisfaction. We could go into next year with a strike over matters that have nothing to do with us." Union's Position Buttressed</p>
        <p>On the 17th day of the eighth work stoppage in 23 seasons, it perhaps is not a startling revelation that owners don't trust one another. Still, an unequivocal expression of that mistrust -- and, by extension, its impact on these negotiations -- was laid out the other day by John Harrington, owner of the Boston Red Sox, in response to a question.</p>
        <p>Harrington didn't talk about trust directly, and perhaps he didn't mean to leave that impression, but he buttressed the union's long-held contention that this dispute is between the owners and not between the owners and the players.</p>
        <p>Last Thursday, after the second day of meetings between groups of owners and players, Harrington was asked at a news conference why the owners linked the salary cap they want the players to accept to the clubs' revenue-sharing plan. Under that plan, adopted last January but made contingent on the players' acceptance of a cap, richer clubs would give portions of their local revenue to poorer clubs.</p>
        <p>"If large and middle-market clubs are going to move money to the small-market clubs," Harrington replied, "we want to insure that that money is spent on player salaries so that the competitive level of those teams that are receiving that money is improved." Take the Money and Run</p>
        <p>Acknowledgement of mistrust No. 1:</p>
        <p>The richer clubs are afraid that the poorer clubs would take the money and run -- to the bank, that is, clinging to their new-found wealth instead of spending it on players. If the wealthier clubs are going to give up some of their money, they want to make sure the San Diego-type teams in their midst use it to improve themselves.</p>
        <p>That aim makes sense and justifies the part of the owners' proposal that calls for a salary floor, or minimum payroll, requiring a team to spend no less than 84 percent of the average club payroll. But, Harrington was asked, why not implement a salary floor without a salary cap?</p>
        <p>"If large-market clubs," he replied, "are going to be taking money out of their coffers, their hard-earned money from ticket prices and media, and moving it to smaller-market clubs, we want to be sure all of the larger-market clubs will be playing on a level field also.</p>
        <p>"There has to be some cap to make sure that when Boston weakens itself by moving $5 or $6 million out of its revenue stream, we don't have some other large-market club investing substantial amounts of non-revenue money in order to buy a pennant. We want a level playing field all the way around, large markets and small markets, so you have to cap the large-market clubs to be sure that they will maintain a competitive level that's fair." Using Personal Fortunes</p>
        <p>Acknowledgement of mistrust No. 2:</p>
        <p>The richer clubs are afraid that some of their kind might spend part of their owners' personal fortune to lure top players and thus gain an unfair competitive advantage. Ewing Kauffman, the late owner of the Kansas City Royals, was noted for that kind of expenditure, and other owners didn't like it.</p>
        <p>In order to prevent such underhanded, overspending practices, the clubs want the players to accept a cap on their salaries. This is just the latest example of what Marvin Miller, the players' legendary labor leader, always said about the owners: They want the players to protect the owners from themselves.</p>
        <p>"It seems silly to us as players," Scott Sanderson, a veteran pitcher with the Chicago White Sox, said yesterday, "to be asked to control the spending on the owners' side when admittedly they have trouble controlling themselves. We're not going to do anything to curb the owners' spending."</p>
        <p>Richard Ravitch, head of the owners' negotiating team, disagreed with the interpretation of Harrington's comments that says the clubs don't trust one another. But he added, "I won't comment on John's comments. He has a thorough understanding of this. Throughout the revenue-sharing debate, John and I engaged in a lengthy discourse." A Level Playing Field</p>
        <p>Bud Selig also didn't see the matter of trust among clubs as an issue.</p>
        <p>"If you're going to reroute money, you want to make sure the playing field is level at all levels," the acting commissioner said. "If I'm a big-market club, you need a cap because it's one thing to change the economic rules, but you're changing them to try to make the playing field level at all levels. That's why you need a minimum and a cap."</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Selig said, the owners are not asking the players to pay for the new system. "We're asking players to share in the burden," he said. "Everybody has to make adjustments. But the amount of the guarantee, $1 billion for player compensation, takes that burden away. If you're forming a new relationship, obviously all parties have to feel they're being treated fairly. That's why we started with $1 billion. We're certainly not asking for givebacks."</p>
        <p>That's not the way the players see it, but then, they don't trust the owners either.  BASEBALL: NEWS ANALYSIS</p>
