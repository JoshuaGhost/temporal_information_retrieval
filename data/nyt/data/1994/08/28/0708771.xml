        <p>Is New York O.K. with this? John Kelly is leaving the 15th Precinct.</p>
        <p>David Caruso, unhappy with his salary, will leave "N.Y.P.D. Blue" after four episodes this fall. The critically acclaimed show was last season's highest-rated new drama, an accomplishment due in no small part to Mr. Caruso's portrayal. Kelly has been the show's ethos, its dramatic center, and his subtle gestures and self-conscious mannerisms have been pivotal in establishing its identity.</p>
        <p>Jimmy Smits, formerly of "L.A. Law," will replace him. It will be a daunting task. Mr. Caruso brought more to the role of Detective Kelly than tangerine-colored hair, a ghostly pallor and a Queens accent. Whether he was grilling a suspect, comforting a victim or calming an anguished colleague, Kelly measured his words, speaking quietly, even a little remorsefully. He didn't scream or toss chairs or revel in the violence and anarchy that the show seems to say is part of a New York cop's life. He seemed to be working below the surface, as if crime were part of a personal conflict. Here, in a few moments from "N.Y.P.D. Blue" is Detective Kelly in all his brooding moral gravity. DANIEL B. SCHNEIDER "O.K., you gonna help me with this?"  Cornering an addict on a park bench, Kelly uses his trademark approach -- he leans in close, locks on his gaze and makes a husky appeal to her conscience. He doesn't accuse as much as ask for a favor. And he makes it personal. No abstract notions of justice: he needs help. "Let it go!"  Kelly tries to calm his enraged partner, Andy Sipowicz (Dennis Franz), who moments before had confronted the Mafioso who, in an early episode, nearly murdered him. Sipowicz's taunting would-be killer is now a protected witness. "We got another problem, Hector." Kelly has gotten a suspect to confess to robbing a taxi driver. Now, trying to get him to confess to a murder, he springs a trap: he steps back, leans against the wall and stares into the distance, feigning disappointment, as if a trusted friend had let him down.  "C'mere." In emotional moments, Kelly will whisper quietly, put his hand on another character's neck, look down reflectively, then shut his eyes and pull him or her into his embrace. In this scene he comforts Officer James Martinez (Nicholas Turturro) after the two discover Martinez's brother dead of a heroin overdose.  "I wanna stay close." Confused and a little scared, Kelly is wistful after making love to his estranged wife. The moment has soured: they're separated, but under a veil of concern, he's still possessive and protective. Of course, Kelly also wants to stay close to his girlfriend (and his partner, his dead father, his Police Academy friends, his childhood pals, his confessor . . . )  TELEVISION</p>
