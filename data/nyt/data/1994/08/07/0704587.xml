        <p>MOZART, Beethoven and Schubert are the common denominators this week at four of the state's summer music festivals: Norfolk, Music Mountain, Chestnut Hill and South Shore.</p>
        <p>At Music Mountain, Beethoven's Op. 127 Quartet and Schubert's "Trout" Quintet are among the enticements at the 3 o'clock recital today by the Leontovitch String Quartet, with the guest artists Alvin Brehm on double bass and Jon Klibonoff at the piano.</p>
        <p>The Borromeo Quartet also offers Beethoven at its visit to Music Mountain next Sunday afternoon at 3, when the "Grosse Fuge" is the centerpiece of a program that also includes Mozart's Quartet in G (K. 387) and, with Peter Takacs, Dvorak's Piano Quintet in A.</p>
        <p>On concert days, call 824-7126 for tickets; otherwise the information number is 496-2596.</p>
        <p>On Friday evening the other three Festivals are all vying for audiences.</p>
        <p>The South Shore guests are the Bachman-Klibonoff-Fridman Trio, who offer a 7:30 P.M. recital at the Pequot Library in Southport devoted to the First Schubert and the Second Mendelssohn Trios (227-0695).</p>
        <p>At 8:30 P.M. the Chestnut Hill concert gets underway at the First Congregational Church of Madison with Beethoven's C Minor Piano Trio, a string duo by Walter Piston and Schumann's Piano Quartet in E-flat.</p>
        <p>The performers are the violinist Arturo Delmoni, the violist Toby Hoffman, the cellist Ronald Thomas and the pianist Randall Hodgkinson (245-5736).</p>
        <p>At Norfolk, Mozart gets the nod with a major work scheduled at both 8:30 P.M. concerts.</p>
        <p>On Friday it's the cheery "Kegelstatt" Trio for clarinet, viola and piano, the program continuing thereafter to a pair of more rarified delights: the Serenade for Winds by Richard Strauss and Bohuslav Martinu's "Revue de Cuisine".</p>
        <p>Saturday's attraction is a Double Concerto threesome with the student- faculty Norfolk Chamber Orchestra under the direction of Peter Csaba. The Mozart is the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin and Viola, that masterwork partnered by Vivaldi's D Major Concerto for flute and violin, and the Shostakovich Concerto No. 1 for piano, trumpet and strings.</p>
        <p>Five artists are soloists: the flutist Ransom Wilson, the trumpeter Allan Dean, the violinist Erick Friedman, the violist Atar Arad and the pianist Boris Berman (542-3000).</p>
        <p>Another couple of concertos are on the 8 P.M. Saturday menu in Harkness Memorial Park as the Summer Music series ends its classical programming for 1994. (There remain a Pops Concert on Aug. 20 and an evening with Art Garfunkel on Aug. 24).</p>
        <p>The Saturday concert begins with Samuel Barber's "Capricorn Concerto" and, after a bucolic interlude with Aaron Copland's "Appalachian Spring," concludes with the pianist Andre Watts joining Peter Sacco and the Connecticut Orchestra in Tchaikovksy's Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat Minor (442-9199).</p>
        <p>Pop music is also part of the programing at Summer Music and Music Mountain.</p>
        <p>In Harkness Park, Natalie Cole spins a delectable web of song in an 8 P.M. Tuesday concert with orchestra (442-9199); at 8 P.M. on Saturday the mountain resounds with New Orleans style jazz of the Big Easy Band (496-2596).</p>
        <p>For more than a month the Hartford Camerata Conservatory has been holding a summer jazz session for area players, and today at 3, both the student and faculty jazz ensembles will demonstrate what they've been up to.</p>
        <p>The annual "Jazz and Roses" concert in Elizabeth Park also highlights a guest appearance by the tenor saxophonist Jerry Bergonzi (346-2588).</p>
        <p>In Stamford, advanced high school players have been rehearsing and performing since last month at the second annual Summer Jazz Workshop, sponsored jointly by the Young Artists Philharmonic and the Stamford Center's "Reach Out" program.</p>
        <p>On Friday evening at 8 the young instrumentalists put on a celebration concert at the Rich Forum. There is no admission charge but seating is limited; reservations may be made by calling 325-4466.</p>
        <p>At the Charles Ives Center for the Arts in Danbury the weekend brings a festival within the festival.</p>
        <p>Headliners at the 3 o'clock program next Saturday are George Benson, Rachelle Ferrell, Marvin Stamm and Dave Brubeck.</p>
        <p>Appearing next Sunday at 2 are Wynton Marsalis, Marcus Roberts, Joe Lovano and the Rippingtons (837-9226).</p>
        <p>If you prefer pop stylings with a strong country flavor, head over to Jorgensen Auditorium in Storrs at 8 P.M. on Saturday when Asleep at the Wheel, a band fusing Western swing and what one critic dubbed "full-tilt boogie," opens the evening for Grand Ole Opry star Emmylou Harris.</p>
        <p>"I like to build fences around feelings and capture them with music," says Ms. Harris, whose brooding ballads and upbeat numbers have filled eight gold albums and corralled six Grammy awards (486-4226).</p>
        <p>The Goodspeed Opera House, not content with showcasing important musicals in East Haddam, and introducing new ones at its experimental Norma Terris Theater in Chester, has now branched out into cabaret.</p>
        <p>For the next three weeks the regular Wednesday, Thursday and Friday shows at the Opera House will be followed by 11 P.M. conclaves next door at the Gelston House.</p>
        <p>During these sessions Perry Codianni, Kathy Niswander, Wanda Slater and Brian West -- joined on occasion by cast members from "Shenandoah" -- will preside over an "Urban/Suburban Showdown Cabaret": show tunes, pop songs, country music and more; the number to call for information is 873-8668.</p>
        <p>The Eastern Connecticut Symphony is offering a simpler way to enjoy the music at Tanglewood: next Sunday a chartered bus will leave the New London Shopping Center at 10 A.M., and return around 7:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>The price of $55 includes transportation (with a lecture en route by the orchestra's music director Paul Phillips plus wine and cheese on the return trip) and a good seat in the Shed for the 2 P.M. concert by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Dennis Russell Davies.</p>
        <p>On the program are Brahms's Symphony No. 2 and Khatchaturian's Violin Concerto with the soloist Itzhak Perlman. For more specifics, call the Symphony office at 443-2876.  MUSIC</p>
