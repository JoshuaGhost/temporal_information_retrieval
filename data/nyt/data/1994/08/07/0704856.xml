        <p>THESE sultry summer evenings make me miss my moonflowers. I usually have some in summer, but this spring the seeds failed to germinate. Now, up on my Brooklyn roof, I wish I'd tried again. They could turn my industrial-looking smokestack into a wall of white perfume.</p>
        <p>The moonvine, Ipomoea alba, begins to open its long, twisted buds at about 4 P.M. and perfumes the air with six-inch pale white saucers until dawn. Only a few bloom each night, and in the morning they droop like exhausted party queens.</p>

        <p>THESE sultry summer evenings make me miss my moonflowers. I usually have some in summer, but this spring the seeds failed to germinate. Now, up on my Brooklyn roof, I wish I'd tried again. They could turn my industrial-looking smokestack into a wall of white perfume.</p>
        <p>The moonvine, Ipomoea alba, begins to open its long, twisted buds at about 4 P.M. and perfumes the air with six-inch pale white saucers until dawn. Only a few bloom each night, and in the morning they droop like exhausted party queens.</p>
        <p>Oenothera biennis, the common evening primrose, is another great night bloomer -- because on midsummer evenings it opens within minutes, for the guests. And once started, it will self-seed year after year.</p>
        <p>"I have a favorite one, called the spinning primrose," James Duke told me last week. Dr. Duke, a botanist and an expert in weeds and medicinal plants, likes to watch whatever comes up in his weedy garden near Beltsville, Md.</p>
        <p>"It's called the spinning primrose because it sort of spins or uncorks as it opens," he said. "That can be as fast as 30 seconds -- from fully closed to fully open."</p>
        <p>Dr. Duke says he has never been so impressed with any flower.</p>
        <p>"It's very dramatic," he said. "One of the calyxes will just go boom -- flip its bippy, as they used to say on 'Laugh-In' -- and that presages the unwinding of the flower."</p>
        <p>Dr. Duke used to invite people over to predict which flower would open first. "We'd sit around and watch the calyxes explode," he said. "A given plant might have 40 or 50 flowers open. It's like miniature fireworks before dusk."</p>
        <p>And right after dusk, the second show starts, as hawk moths, which resemble hummingbirds, zero in to pollinate the big yellow flowers. By morning, last evening's primroses are as crumpled as wet tissue paper, just like the moonflowers.</p>
        <p>If you know anybody with seeds, now's the time to scatter them about. They'll develop a rosette of leaves by frost, and if you mulch them for the winter they'll start growing again next spring. By next Fourth of July, with a little luck, you'll have your own fireworks display.</p>
        <p>In the country, I don't think much about evening gardens. I might sniff a moonflower or two on the porch, or take a walk down the lane for a whiff of honeysuckle. But then it's time for bed -- because you have to get up at dawn to pick all those beans and can all those tomatoes.</p>
        <p>But in the city, days are spent in traffic jams or in 100-degree subway stations -- or sub-zero air-conditioned offices. I don't even remember I have a garden until evening, when I climb up on my roof and watch the lights come on in the surrounding buildings as others come home from work. The very sky seems to breathe a sigh of relief. And heady fragrances ride the night air. Flowers that are quite drab during the day lift their heads and start flirting with moths.</p>
        <p>Louise Beebe Wilder wrote about all these evening goings-on in "The Fragrant Garden" (Macmillan, 1932). The old-fashioned Bouncing Bet (Saponaria officinalis), she said, is "dowdy and forlorn" during the day, and the Melancholy gilliflower (Matthiola bicornis) keeps its "brownish purple flowers rolled up in little sulky balls." It's best to hide these types, she advised, in the shrubbery or under windows, where they won't be noticed during the day.</p>
        <p>But come dusk, the shy creatures turn into Jezebels. Wilder quoted a friend of hers, Joseph Jacob, as saying the Melancholy gilliflower turned into "a veritable active volcano of the most delicious perfume," and he advised that it be sown in late summer, "over the heads of departing bulbs."</p>
        <p>A lot can be learned from these wonderful old garden writers. And many of the smaller catalogues, botanical gardens and horticultural societies now offer seeds of once-forgotten beauties. Some of the more familiar flowers that smell sweeter -- or spicier -- at night are white nicotiana, pinks, petunias and honeysuckle.</p>
        <p>The tuberose is so intense in the evening that perfume makers in Wilder's day extracted its essences after dark. And "sentimental German ladies," she wrote, "called it Nachtliebste because of its night sweetness." Some even claimed the tuberose emitted sparks of light. But then, she continued, as so often happens in the fickle garden world, the poor thing "fell into bad odor, so to speak, when it became too popular as a funeral flower."</p>
        <p>The vesper campion, another sweet night bloomer, also fell out of favor in Wilder's time. She owned a book called "Farm Weeds" that referred to it as a "common impurity" in the clover fields. And anyone in search of it had to turn to botany texts and wildflower guides. "Fashion has turned its back upon them," she wrote, "and the poor dears have fled for shelter to the wayside and fields and taken to the roving gypsy life. 'Escaped' is the way their departure is usually described."</p>
        <p>A wide variety of night bloomers, from shrubs and trees to bulbs, annuals and perennials can be found in "The Evening Garden" (Macmillan, 1993), written and illustrated by Peter Loewer, who grows many of them in his garden in Asheville, N.C.</p>
        <p>The nocturnal day lily, Hemerocallis citrina, is one of his favorites. The flowers are pale lemon-yellow and sweetly fragrant; and unlike some day lilies, it has handsome leaves. Dark green and rippled along the edges, citrina may grow as long as 40 inches and turns a golden yellow in the fall. A healthy one can have 50 flower buds on each stem.</p>
        <p>Mr. Loewer also recommends the tropical sweet Bouvardia (Bouvardia longiflora), which needs greenhouse protection from northern winters but does fine in the summer, lounging on a porch or terrace. "It has really long tubed white waxy flowers, and it's incredible when it gets dark," Mr. Loewer said. "It smells of jasmine. But the minute morning comes, the smell disappears."</p>
        <p>He's also fond of the saw-toothed sunflower, Helianthus grosseserratus, because it smells like chocolate -- day and night. These 12-footers can sport 10 to 15 blossoms to a stalk.</p>
        <p>"We also grow dame's rocket down by the garden wall, but it elicits no attention from people walking through the garden -- until night, when it starts to smell," he said. It has a violetlike fragrance, which is why the old-timers called it dame's violets.</p>
        <p>All those who grow bottle gourds should make sure they go out to their patches at night. "The flowers open at night or on a gloomy afternoon," Mr. Loewer said. "And the petals are so delicate they almost melt in the morning dew. But they've already been pollinated by moths and the gourds are starting to form."</p>
        <p>Mr. Loewer also explained why green leaves and red flowers are the first to fade to gray as the sun goes down, then the blues, then the yellows.  And why, in the dark, the garden looks black and white -- and white flowers seem especially luminous.</p>
        <p>"You've got rods and cones in the retina of the eye," Mr. Loewer said. "The cones respond to color and the rods respond to the intensity of light. Which is why you can read a newspaper in the moonlight, but a color picture would look black and white."</p>
        <p>But who could read a newspaper with all that heavy dime-store perfume and all those flowers seducing moths? The garden is so ferociously sexy at night, it's almost lurid. THIS WEEK  Find Those Gypsy-Moth Eggs</p>
        <p>Keep weeding and picking the beans before they get too tough. Make pickles out of the cucumbers and bread out of the zucchini. Grill the eggplants and make more pesto out of that basil. But if the vegetable garden is growing past your window, run for the beach.</p>
        <p>Look out for hornworms in the tomato patch, and stab them with your trowel. Drown slugs in beer. Squish the Japanese beetles, or toss them in a can full of soapy water.</p>
        <p>Gypsy moths are now laying their eggs on everything from oak trees and day-lily stems to house siding, said Richard Weir, a Cornell Cooperative Extension agent for Nassau County, Long Island. This is one job you can't ignore: scrape off those clusters of eggs, which are fuzzy tan or chamois-colored, or rub them with a burlap cloth.</p>
        <p>The eggs are easily destroyed by breaking the silky sacs, which can contain 100 to 700 eggs. Your trees will thank you.</p>
        <p>Forgive yourself for all the things you forgot to do or neglected this summer. Lie back in the hammock and order some autumn crocuses to plant later this month, old-fashioned roses to plant this fall and plenty of spring bulbs to put in as the weather cools. The best thing about gardening is that there's always next year.</p>
