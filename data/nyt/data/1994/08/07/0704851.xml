        <p>The sister of a New Jersey woman whose husband is charged in her murder is hoping to win custody of the couple's two children without resorting to Jordanian courts, her Jordanian lawyer said today.</p>
        <p>The lawyer said Muhammad Ismail Abequa, who is being held on charges of first-degree murder and kidnapping, can resolve a dispute by signing over custody to his wife's family. But members of Mr. Abequa's family have insisted they want the children raised in Jordan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abequa, a naturalized American born in Jordan, has confessed to strangling his wife, Nihal, and fleeing here with their children, Lisa, 6, and Sami, 3.</p>
        <p>Nihal Abequa's sister, Nesime Dokur, arrived in Jordan with two American lawyers on Monday seeking to return to the United States with the children.</p>
        <p>She appointed two Jordanian lawyers, Yacoub Far and Abdullah al-Khalil, to represent her and her mother, Meryem Gussal, who have been named by a New Jersey judge as the children's legal guardians.</p>
        <p>Jordanian officials have said the courts are likely to rule in favor of Nihal Abequa's family. But Ms. Dokur's lawyers are hoping to avoid a protracted custody battle by solving the case amicably.</p>
        <p>The children are staying with Mr. Abequa's mother on the outskirts of Amman.</p>
        <p>The United States Ambassador, Wesley W. Egan, discussed the case this week with Jordan's Minister of Justice, Hisham Etall. He said an administrative solution was possible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Egan said he would also continue to work for Mr. Abequa's extradition to the United States.</p>
