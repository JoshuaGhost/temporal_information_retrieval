        <p>Health care legislation is hanging by a fraying thread. Eleven months after President Clinton proclaimed a bold -- and complex -- proposal to guarantee health insurance to all Americans, the last clear legislative path toward that goal seems to be closing.</p>
        <p>Last Friday's bipartisan proposal by the self-styled "mainstream coalition," which seemed to pro-Administration Democrats to offer a welcome basis for negotiation, looks less encouraging today after the group's Republican leader, Senator John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, continued to present it in all but "take it or leave it" terms.</p>
        <p>The mainstream plan, far less sweeping than the bill now before the Senate, aims at $100 billion in deficit reduction and insuring 92 percent of Americans, up from the current 85 percent, by 2004. The Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, has legislation on the floor which seeks 95 percent coverage by 2000, and says that employers could be required to pay half of workers' insurance premiums if that goal is missed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell, in an interview, insisted there was no occasion for gloom. He said negotiations were difficult but said, "It is within our reach to get agreement." He said Mr. Chafee's assertions of firmness were "obviously and understandably negotiating positions."</p>
        <p>But what sounded to many like another retreat on health care was sounded from the other side of the Capitol today as Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters at a breakfast that if legislation guaranteeing health insurance for all Americans could not be passed in Congress, then he could settle for a bill providing progress on insurance-law changes. The Administration has repeatedly scorned the idea of changes in the insurance industry (barring companies from refusing to insure people with medical problems, for instance) unless they are accompanied by universal coverage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foley said that if Congress could not pass a universal coverage bill, it could either put the issue off until next year or "try and find legislation that can pass and make significant, if initial, steps toward the goals of coverage, avoidance of cost shifting, maintainance of quality, all those things, including some strategies for controlling costs."</p>
        <p>He said the minimum he could accept was a bill that provided one or more of these elements: "real progress in coverage, real progress in insurance reform and protection without untoward consequences, real progress in health care and a line to future improvements."</p>
        <p>His comments crystallized a growing recognition that supporters of universal health insurance may be unable to get it through Congress, and must soon decide whether to accept something less if they think it points the way to full coverage.</p>
        <p>No less an advocate of universal coverage than Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who has seen past efforts founder on unwillingness to compromise, has been urging less experienced senators who favor universal coverage to take the long view and not be too quick to reject promising moves short of universal coverage. He has said senators should wait until they see the results of negotiations.</p>
        <p>But even the chance of significant incremental change like that Mr. Foley described may evaporate if negotiations between Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Chafee and others in his group do not show progress soon. Waiting for Fine Print</p>
        <p>The Mitchell approach to the talks, as described by him and his allies, is that once they have seen the fine print, they hope to accept many of Mr. Chafee's proposals but want some others put to a vote in the Senate. They cite issues like the mainstream plan's lack of provision for prescription drugs for the elderly despite severe limits on future Medicare spending as the sort of issue they cannot accept without a vote.</p>
        <p>Democrats pointed out that they were not asking the mainstream group to trade with them and give up some of its stands -- just to agree to put some of them to a vote. "I think it's a reasonable approach," Senator John D. Rockefeller 4th, Democrat of West Virginia, said today. And Mr. Mitchell said several members of the mainstream group had told him his approach was fair.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Chafee was asked today if that approach satisfied him, he replied, "It doesn't, because we spent a lot of time ironing out very fundamental differences" during the mainstream group's 60 hours of discussions. He said he could not accept seeing its plan "radically altered." "We haven't quite said, 'Take it or leave it,' " he said, "because that would sound very demanding." Chafee's Words Recalled</p>
        <p>But even without saying it, he sounds that way to many disappointed Democrats. On Monday he told a group of Democrats that while different members of his group of about 20 senators had different levels of flexibility, "In my own case, there is probably not a lot of room for negotiation," one of those Democrats said.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats say, or hope, this is just a negotiating pose. That group is typified by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who said: "I have the greatest respect for John Chafee. John Chafee believes in health care reform. I think his vision is too narrow, but he's not just talking." Mr. Reid added, "He's got some wiggle room, but I don't know how much."</p>
        <p>Another knowledgeable Democratic Senator, insisting on anonymity, said he believed Mr. Chafee would be willing to deal, once the time came, whatever he said today.</p>
        <p>But the time is likely to come very soon, if it comes at all. There are only 10 weeks left until Election Day. While Senator John Glenn said he would work as long as it takes to pass a bill and "If I have to change my Christmas Eve plans, so be it," the Ohio Democrat is not up for election this year. Others who do face the voters this year, such as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, seem more restive.</p>
        <p>The time affects the prospects of any health care legislation significantly. Agreements will be necessary to get votes scheduled in the Senate, where Republicans outside the mainstream group have mounted a considerable delaying action. There has to be time for the Congressional Budget Office to evaluate plans. There probably now has to be Senate action before the House will vote, and then there has to be time for a House-Senate conference to compromise differences. It can be done in the time that is left, but not easily. Ready to Deal?</p>
        <p>The time taken up by the Republican filibuster against the crime bill is not a problem, however. Not only does it link Democrats' charges of Republican obstruction to an issue the public cares even more about than health care, it gives Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Kennedy time to negotiate on health, instead of staying on the Senate floor and waving their health insurance cards at the Republicans.</p>
        <p>But the next question that has to be answered is whether the mainstream group, and especially Mr. Chafee, is prepared to deal. One senator after another says he hopes so, because Mr. Chafee's commitment is much more than the 60 hours the group spent on the issue. "He can't go home without a bill," Democrats say hopefully.</p>
        <p>"I trust John Chafee," Mr. Kenendy told Democrats at lunch the other day.</p>
        <p>"I know John Chafee," said Mr. Rockefeller, "but I'm having a hard time reading him. I'm optimistic. But I'm worried."</p>
