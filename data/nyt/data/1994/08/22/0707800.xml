        <p>The Israeli stock market plummeted nearly 10 percent today, as jittery investors were given the first chance to react to a Government decision last week to impose a capital gains tax on stock profits.</p>
        <p>The benchmark Mishtanim index fell 18.22 points, or 9.93 percent, to 165.18, and analysts expect further declines Monday morning.</p>
        <p>The market erupted into pandemonium early as sellers unloaded stocks. Tel Aviv Stock Exchange officials said trading started with sell orders of two billion shekels, or $660 million.</p>
        <p>Market officials, for the first time in the exchange's 40-year-history, lifted a 10 percent limit on the fluctuation of share prices within a single day. The market's usual closing time was also extended by four hours. Losses on individual share prices ranged from 10 to 20 percent. A Surprise for the Market</p>
        <p>Ninety minutes into trading, the Government tried to soften the effects of the new tax, allowing stock profits to be offset against losses. But brokers said the change had little effect on the market.</p>
        <p>"If every sale that was profitable was taxed a flat 10 percent, regardless of other losses, your grand total at the end of the day could be a big loss," said Eddy Shalev, the director of the Tel Aviv office of Oscar Gruss &amp; Son, the largest dealer of Israeli stocks in the United States. "You would end up not with a 10 percent real tax, but a much higher tax."</p>
        <p>The market was taken by surprise on Tuesday when the Government announced that it would impose a 10 percent tax on stock profits beginning Jan. 1. The Government then closed the market until today.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in June 1993 that he would not impose a capital gains tax. But on Monday, Israel announced a higher-than-expected rise of 1.1 percent in inflation for July. The figure brought the annual inflation rate to 13.5 percent, well above the official forecast of 8 percent. Mr. Rabin, treasury officials said, was persuaded to adopt the tax in hopes of curbing inflation.</p>
        <p>"When speaking of a Prime Minister and Finance Minister, don't expect them to tell the whole truth when speaking of a devaluation or when speaking of a new taxation policy," Mr. Rabin said after the announcement last week.</p>
        <p>Finance Minister Avraham Shohat said: "This temporary instability will finally result in a much more stable stock market. To make big changes, and to be part of the outside world, we must, like other countries, impose a capital gains tax."</p>
        <p>The opposition Likud party, which opposes the measure, called today for a special session of the Parliament to debate the tax, which, in its initial form, is expected to raise about $167 million a year.</p>
        <p>"This is total chaos," said Binyamin Netanyahu, the head of Likud. "It is not the way to build an economy."</p>
        <p>Treasury officials said today, after the amendment to the tax, that investors could choose between options when purchasing stocks. The first option will allow investors to pay a flat 10 percent on any profits. The second option will allow investors to make any losses tax deductible, but subject any profits made in the market to a 20 to 25 percent tax. Only Limited Orders</p>
        <p>The capital gains tax comes as other taxes, such as import taxes on items like computers as well as purchase taxes on housing, have been lowered. Taxing share profits, officials said, will bring in revenues that will permit the Government to cut other taxes, like import duties on raw materials, that have fueled rising retail prices.</p>
        <p>"I hope this in-between stage is short," said Jakov Frenkel, the governor of Israel's Central Bank. "The main reason for taxing capital gains was to introduce reason and order into the economy and to cut other taxes that have a much more destructive effect on the public."</p>
        <p>The stock exchange, to prevent a steeper decline, only permitted limit orders, thus making it impossible to access the full impact of the new law. Heavy losses, at least early in the day, are expected Monday when the market, will, for the first time, allow market orders.</p>
        <p>The tax is seen by many brokers as a severe blow to Israel's mutual fund companies. Sales to Pension Funds</p>
        <p>"This is very bad for mutual funds because it will make it unwise for institutional investors, such as pension funds or insurance companies, to invest in mutual funds," Mr Shalev said. "If the mutual fund companies are forced to implement a 10 percent tax on the profits of each sale, corporations will, in essence, be taxed twice.</p>
        <p>"It will also be unwise for pension funds to invest in mutual funds in the stock exchange because pension funds are totally exempt for any taxes," he said, "even with the new law. It will be better for them to invest directly in the stock exchange."</p>
        <p>Once stocks dip low enough, investors expect the pension funds to step in and begin to buy. This could happen, brokers said, as early as Monday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The new tax is also expected to slow foreign investment in Israel's stock market. In the last few months, brokers estimate that the market attracted between $200 million and $300 million, most from Britain and the United States. Israel, given the peace prospects, has been touted by many brokers as an emerging market.</p>
        <p>"It will be very difficult for institutions in America to explain the primitive tax scheme to investors," said Mr. Shalev. "American taxes take into consideration losses, even from previous years. This will not be the case here."</p>
        <p>Israel's stock market has a capitalization of about $35 billion. The Mishtanim index involves 99 of the most-traded stocks out of a total of about 700 companies are traded. The market has fallen about 25 percent since the end of the year.</p>
        <p>A middle-aged coule from Lod with five children were among the small investors despondent after today's trading. The wife, who like her husband insisted on anonymity, said that all year "the bank kept telling us not to sell, so we didn't sell."</p>
        <p>"Everyday our stocks went down," she said. "Now we have lost 60 percent of our savings."</p>
