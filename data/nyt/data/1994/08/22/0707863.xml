        <p>Recent reports that German police have intercepted small amounts of nuclear material on Europe's black market are a chilling reminder that the end of the cold war brings no guarantee of nuclear safety. Indeed, the disintegration of the former Soviet Union with its huge stockpiles of weapons and nuclear materials may actually make the world more dangerous than it was when such materials were under police-state control.</p>
        <p>Surely there is no more urgent task before the world's governments than eradicating this embryonic trade. Yet Russia resists, and the Clinton Administration has been slow to press the issue.</p>
        <p>The materials intercepted in four recent incidents by German authorities were not in themselves a weapon threat -- the amounts of plutonium and highly enriched uranium were too small and too impure to make a bomb. What is unnerving is that these small amounts appear to have been samples designed to generate future sales of larger amounts to foreign countries or terrorist groups eager to make nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>There is no evidence yet that any warheads or enough material for a bomb have actually been spirited out of Russia. But German officials were right to sound the alarm. The known seizures could be a mere fraction of the dangerous traffic.</p>
        <p>The former Soviet Union relied on physical security at installations and close monitoring of its population to prevent anyone from making off with nuclear materials. But with the police state now gone, criminal gangs proliferating and social turbulence rising, conditions seem ripe for thefts.</p>
        <p>The most immediate need is for intensified police work to intercept smugglers. That will require an unusual degree of cooperation among police and intelligence agencies in Europe and the former Soviet Union, with help from the U.S.</p>
        <p>Stronger protective measures are also required at all military and civilian nuclear sites in the former Soviet bloc. At a minimum there must be an accurate inventory; even Russian officials acknowledge they have lost track of who possesses what nuclear material.</p>
        <p>Only the Russians can truly fix the security breakdown, and they are sending mixed signals. President Boris Yeltsin has promised to block the trade in nuclear contraband, and many Russian officials seem eager to upgrade security. But nationalist politicians and many atomic energy officials in Russia dismiss the concerns as Western propaganda. Unless responsible leaders prevail, the task appears hopeless.</p>
        <p>Securing Russia's nuclear stockpiles is a matter of great urgency. Yet the Clinton Administration, distracted by domestic battles and other foreign crises, has given it only fitful attention. No high-level official is working on the problem full time, and diplomacy is going very slowly. As the President prepares for a meeting with Mr. Yeltsin in September, there is no more important issue for the White House to engage.</p>
