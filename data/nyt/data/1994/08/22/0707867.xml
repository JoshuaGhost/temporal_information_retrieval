        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Aug. 11, the day before the baseball strike deadline, two friends of mine attended a New York Yankee game at the stadium to enjoy an afternoon of baseball. They went with two other men from their office as their guests.</p>
        <p>In their section of field-level box seats, my friends were refused service by two concession employees. A hot dog vendor did not respond to numerous polite vocal and physical attempts. At one point the people in the section behind them commented that it was apparent that the vendor just did not want to serve them.</p>
        <p>The second case was a bartender, serving drinks to others as the four men approached, refusing to serve them, claiming it wasn't her job.</p>
        <p>My friends, who are black, had to ask their guests, who are white, to get the attention of the hot dog vendor and service of the bartender. Incredibly, the guests were served promptly and courteously. Apparently more than baseball is going on at Yankee Stadium.  STEVEN A. COHEN  Scotch Plains, N.J., Aug. 16, 1994</p>
