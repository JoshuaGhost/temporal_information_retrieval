        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Bombing in the Bronx" (Op-Ed, July 26) attempts to characterize the New York Yankees as uninvolved, uncaring members of our community, who provide no support to our neighborhood and its children.</p>
        <p>All Hallows High School can say without hesitation and with gratitude that the Yankees, as an organization and individually, have provided material support for our school.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have regularly donated time, money and equipment to aid All Hallows in its mission of providing quality educational opportunities to the many deserving and talented young men of our community. While the Yankee interest has been a quiet one, it has been continual and meaningful, free of any public relations.</p>
        <p>All Hallows was founded in 1909 and has shared the same Bronx neighborhood with the Yankees for a substantial portion of that time. While other businesses have left the Bronx, the Yankees have remained.  (Brother) LAWRENCE T. MURPHY  President All Hallows High School Bronx, July 28, 1994</p>
