        <p>TEEN-AGER INDICTED IN CROWN HTS. DEATH</p>
        <p>The teen-ager who was acquitted in the stabbing death of a Hasidic scholar during four days of violence in Crown Heights in 1991 has been indicted on Federal charges that he violated the scholar's civil rights, his lawyer said. The new charges against Lemrick Nelson Jr., 18, who moved to the Atlanta area after his 1992 trial, came just days before the third anniversary of the racial unrest that tarnished the image of Mayor David N. Dinkins and came to be a major campaign issue between him and his victorious challenger, Rudolph W. Giuliani. A1.</p>
        <p>Crown Heights has lodged in the city's political craw and will not go away. News analysis, B2.</p>
        <p>A chronology of the Crown Heights case. B2. NEW YORK CITY CHANCELLOR SUGGESTS SCHOOLS BUDGET CUTS</p>
        <p>Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines said that he would allow the average class size in first through third grades to rise and would trim special education programs to help achieve $85 million in budget cuts demanded by City Hall. The city's high schools and 32 community school districts would absorb $21.9 million of the reductions, cutting their budgets by roughly $24 per student, Mr. Cortines said. B3.</p>
        <p>ORGANIZED CRIME INQUIRY SABOTAGED</p>
        <p>An extensive Federal undercover operation that was intended to block the Lucchese crime family from gaining a new foothold in New Jersey was blown apart when a police officer apparently tipped off one of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, the authorities said. The collapse of the investigation was revealed in a Federal indictment that chronicled how an array of law-enforcement agencies had massed last year to push back the incursion by the Luccheses, only to have the efforts sabotaged when the identity of an informer was revealed. B3.</p>
        <p>GIULIANI NAMES A NEW SANITATION CHIEF</p>
        <p>John J. Doherty, who joined the city's Department of Sanitation as a garbage collector in 1960 and then rose through its uniformed and administrative ranks, will be the department's new Commissioner, Mayor Giuliani announced. Mr. Doherty takes over at a crucial time for the Department of Sanitation. B3.</p>
        <p>AUDIT FAULTS TRANSPORTATION AGENCY</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority overbilled the city last year by more than $1 million for policing and maintaining stations on two commuter railroad lines, according to audits released by the City Comptroller. The audits also found that a majority of Metro-North Commuter Railroad and Long Island Rail Road stations within city limits had deteriorated and needed repairs. B5. REGION KING TAKES ROLE IN SLAYING CASE</p>
        <p>The children of a man who has confessed to strangling his wife in New Jersey and has fled to Jordan were put in the care of King Hussein, the suspect's family said. "We handed the kids over this morning and we are happy," said a sister of the suspect, Muhammad Ismail Abequa. "We have had enough." B4.</p>
        <p>YASGUR'S FARM WAS NEVER LIKE THIS</p>
        <p>For months now, the promoters of Woodstock '94 have been been predicting that their commemorative festival would run with a precision unseen at its famous, disorganized predecessor. One the first day of operation, those predictions fell a bit flat. About 5,000 people were stranded at parking lots for up to six hours because of a series of last-minute logistical delays. B4.</p>
        <p>The producers of Woodstock '94 stand an excellent chance of making millions. B4.</p>
