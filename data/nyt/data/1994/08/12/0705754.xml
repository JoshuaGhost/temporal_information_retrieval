        <p>IF the major-league players and owners don't agree on a contract, last night's games will turn out to be the end of the 1994 season. One by one, the lights will go out in stadiums across America. The bright beacon of Yankee Stadium will fade to black. Shea Stadium, admittedly a flickering beam this year, will be extinguished like a sputtering candle. And millions of fans will be left in the lurch. There's only one thing to say.</p>
        <p>Let's go, Pittsfield Mets!  Come on, Albany-Colonie Yanks! PLAY BALL!</p>
        <p>The major league may have folded its tent, but in Mudvilles all over New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, the game is still played, and for the next few weeks championships are on the line and the hot dogs are every bit as lousy as the ones at the big-league parks. Forget about the Bronx and Flushing. Think Fishkill and Binghamton, Trenton and New Britain. The game will be rawer, the talent shakier, the faces younger. But it will still be baseball. And four of the teams within driving range are affiliated with the Mets and Yankees. That makes for guilt-free rooting. New Yorkers can cheer on the Pittsfield and Binghamton Mets, or the Albany-Colonie and Oneonta Yanks with full confidence that they are supporting the franchise. And Mets fans could even be rewarded with a victory.</p>
        <p>First, a little orientation. Baseball may be the ultimate expression of the American soul, but it's class-ridden just the same. Players, like French chefs, rise though apprenticeship levels. After being signed by a major league team, they are assigned to a farm club affiliated with the parent team. The four levels are Rookie League, Class A, Class AA and Class AAA. Somewhat confusingly, there are also unaffiliated minor league teams, which play in independent leagues, but they do not enter the picture here.</p>
        <p>Each major league team is allowed one Class AA and one Class AAA team, and most have a handful of Class A teams, which are often the first stop for new players. The area's A teams are bunched together in the New York-Penn League, at 55 years of age the oldest continuously operating A league in baseball.</p>
        <p>As in the majors, the different classes are divided into leagues and divisions, with teams competing for playoff spots and a crack at the championship series. The winners get to douse each other in cheap beer.</p>
        <p>Minor league baseball bears about the same relation to the major league variety as a road show of "Cats" in Paducah bears to the real thing on Broadway. The game retains a small-town, small-time flavor. The owners, keen to squeeze every penny out of their businesses, run promotions like pie-eating contests, on-field baseball-throwing contests, tricycle races, pizza giveaways and drawings for a free oil change.</p>
        <p>The talent varies wildly, sometimes within the same player from inning to inning. Flashes of genuine brilliance alternate with appalling ineptitude. The outfielder who looks like Willie Mays on one play can turn right around and make a Little League mistake the next. No lead is ever big enough, no deficit insurmountable.</p>
        <p>Fans learn to be grateful for small favors, like pop flies that get caught and double plays that get turned without major incident. They learn to avert their eyes when the hometown pitcher can't put the ball within two feet of the strike zone.</p>
        <p>That's why the term bush league means what it does. That's why a cheap fly ball that just clears the infield for a base hit is called a Texas Leaguer. What do you expect from a team called the Hickory Crawdads, the Madison Hatters or the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes?</p>
        <p>At the Triple A level, however, fans are looking at players teetering on the verge of the majors (as well as the dubious talents that have been sent back down from Olympus, perhaps never to return). The minors afford a glimpse of baseball's greats before they're great. It's the sports equivalent of hearing the Beatles in the Cavern Club.</p>
        <p>Warts and all, the minors are popular. Last year, attendance was at an all-time high of 30 million, with minor league teams averaging 3,300 fans a game, and the mighty Buffalo Bisons, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Triple A club, drawing more than a million fans for the sixth year in a row.</p>
        <p>New stadiums are sprouting up all over the place. This year, two minor league franchises are bringing baseball back to New Jersey, ending a 16-year drought that began when the Oakland A's moved their Class A team out of Jersey City. Nationally, total sales of merchandise with minor league logos grew from $2.5 million in 1991 to $40 million last year.</p>
        <p>So who needs the majors? For a refresher course on the minor league ambiance, check out the films "Bull Durham" and "Long Gone." For the real thing, head out to New Haven, Elmira, N.Y., or Augusta, N.J., and root, root, root for the home team. Here's a sampling of minor league ballparks. Syracuse Chiefs</p>
        <p>MacArthur Stadium, Syracuse. Class AAA, Toronto Blue Jays affiliate, 291 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Center field is Death Valley, 434 feet to the fence. Only eight players have ever hit one out to straightaway center. The ballpark has great promotions. Besides Bat Night and Hat Night, fans get Comedy Night (free funny noses and glasses) and, if they're really lucky, Dynamite Lady. "She puts herself in a box at home plate and blows herself up," said Tex Simone, the team's general manager for 34 years. Right now, the Chiefs, with 17 home games left, are chasing Ottawa and a chance to battle the Pawtucket Red Sox in the Eastern Division of the International League. Binghamton Mets</p>
        <p>Municipal Stadium, Binghamton, N.Y. Class AA, New York Mets affiliate, 185 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Yes! The Mets are riding high atop the Northern Division of the Eastern League, with a three-and-a-half-game lead over the New Haven Ravens, and 11 home games left. The dimensions are nearly equal to Shea's: 400 feet to dead center, 330 feet down the lines. Played host to the Class AA All-Star Game this year and fans got to see Dwight Gooden pitch his way back to the majors. The team mascot is Ballwinkle. "He's a big, blue furry thing, with bats in place of horns," said Megan Molnar, the team's marketing director. "He's very strange looking." Albany-Colonie Yankees</p>
        <p>Heritage Park, Albany. Class AA, New York Yankees affiliate, 150 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won league championships in 1989, 1990 and 1991, one of them under a fellow named Buck Showalter. This year, they are in third place, eight and a half games behind the Binghamton Mets after being swept in a four-game series by the Mets. Hope gleams faintly on the horizon, however, since the last four games of the season are against the second-place New Haven Ravens.</p>
        <p>The Yanks' Tate Seefried leads the league with 25 home runs. Even more impressive, the team has three mascots, Grounder (a large baseball with a human inside), a guy in a gorilla costume named Ballrilla (get it?) and Mr. Cleansweep, a dapper fellow in a tux. New Haven Ravens</p>
        <p>Yale Field, New Haven. Class AA, Colorado Rockies affiliate, 75 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Another new team, taking up residence in the 67-year-old ballpark where George Bush played first base for Yale, and Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Ted Williams appeared in exhibition games. A $3.5 million facelift, accomplished with private donations, has given the stadium new seats and lights, and a nice landscaped hill overlooking right field, where picknickers can enjoy the game. Tradition still rules. The crescent-shaped roof over the grandstand has not been tampered with. Fans will still see the 35-foot-high manual scoreboard, and the facelift has spared the special double seat built for William Howard Taft, whose 300-pound frame needed a little room to spread out. New Britain Red Sox</p>
        <p>Beehive Field, New Britain, Conn. Class AA, Boston Red Sox affiliate, 100 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>The Sox are in their 12th and last season at Beehive Field, and their 38th year affiliated with the Red Sox, the longest-running affiliation in the minors. At the moment it looks as though the state and city governments will come up with $10.5 million to build a new baseball palace for the Sox. The main attraction in past years was Jeff Bagwell, a local hero who was plucked from Beehive Field by the Houston Astros. On July 3, the crowd was electrified when a fan threw a baseball 60 feet through a small hole and won $5,000.</p>
        <p>With 16 home games left, the Sox are languishing. "We're hanging around last place, which is basically where we've been since Bagwell left," said Pete Tredwell, a spokesman for the team. Trenton Thunder</p>
        <p>Mercer County Waterfront Park, Trenton. Class AA, Detroit Tigers affiliate, 85 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Minor league baseball returns to Trenton for the first time in 16 years, courtesy of Sam Plumeri, whose father once owned a minor league team that played in old Wetzel Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Thunder has not been rumbling this year in the team's fancy new $14.2 million stadium, Mercer County Waterfront Park, which overlooks the Delaware River. The team is at the bottom of the Eastern League's southern division, more than 20 games behind the Harrisburg Senators. The team's .411 winning percentage looks bad, but there are a few with even worse records, and down in the Rookie League, the Atlanta Braves' team has achieved a truly unbelievable .195 percentage, which suggests a death wish. Pittsfield Mets</p>
        <p>Wahconah Park, Pittsfield, Mass. Class A, New York Mets affiliate, 140 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Wahconah, celebrating its 75th birthday, is a pitcher's park. It's 430 feet to right center. The stands are right on top of the right and left field lines, which means there is virtually no foul territory. The park, built in the days before night baseball, faces west, which means occasional sun delays. This is a straightforward, traditional park, with fairly sober promotions. "It's the way baseball used to be," said Ed Forfa, the team's ticket manager. One wrinkle: children get to go out on the field and dance during the fifth inning. New Jersey Cardinals</p>
        <p>Skylands Park, Augusta, N.J., Class A, St. Louis Cardinals affiliate, 45 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Like the Trenton Thunder, the Cardinals are playing their first season in a new stadium, the $9 million Skylands Park in Sussex County. The ballpark, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, is the only shareholder-owned stadium in the minors. The red and white stadium looks like a barn, which is only fitting, said a team spokeswoman, "because we are basically in the middle of a cornfield." Asked if the stadium boasts any unusual features, the spokeswoman said, "Yes, it is not completed."</p>
        <p>It's ready enough for baseball, even if the skyboxes are still under construction, and the Cards are playing great ball, at the top of the division with 13 home games left. The team gets top honors for the cutest-named mascot in the majors or minors, Claudia Cardin-al.  Oneonta Yankees</p>
        <p>Damaschke Field, Oneonta, N.Y. Class A, New York Yankees affiliate, 186 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Damaschke Field, built in 1906, sits in a 100-acre park. The grandstand was built in the 1930's with W.P.A. money. It's a spacious park, 406 feet to center. With 11 home games left, the Yanks toil in last place, but better days lie ahead. The team got last year's top draft pick, the pitcher Matt Drews, whose grandfather Karl pitched for the big-league Yanks. And in Brian Buchanan it has this year's top draft pick as well.</p>
        <p>"We have a young team, but a team with many potential major leaguers," said Sam Nader, the team's president and majority owner. He's seen some good ones over the years, like Willie McGee and Don Mattingly. Current Yanks Pat Kelly, Gerald Williams, Bernie Williams and Jim Leyritz all graduated from Oneonta, and Buck Showalter started out as a manager there in 1985. Hudson Valley Renegades</p>
        <p>Dutchess Stadium, Fishkill, N.Y. Class A, Texas Rangers affiliate, 70 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>New team, new ballpark: the $7.2 million Dutchess Stadium. The location is picturesque, with towering trees over left field, a mountain over the right, and Fishkill Correctional Facility off in the distance. "It's an old stately looking building, not like a prison at all," said Steve Gliner, the team's director of sales and marketing. "It's a nice sight."</p>
        <p>You can't get more local than this team, whose name was picked from more than 5,000 entries sent in by area residents. Runners-up included the Vipers, the Venom and the Jailbirds. Despite being in last place, The team has been a big morale booster for the area, and season tickets for its 38 home games have sold briskly. For the remaining 14 games, there are only singles left in the reserved and box seats. Keep an eye out for the pitcher Reid Ryan, son of the Texas flame-thrower Nolan Ryan. Elmira Pioneers</p>
        <p>Dunn Field, Elmira, N.Y. Class A, Florida Marlins, 241 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Elmira is one of only five cities that have had minor league ball for more than a century, and more than 400 future major leaguers have played there. The town is now on its third stadium in 106 years, Dunn Field, a 53-year-old park with one of baseball's more bizarre claims to fame. It was there, 43 years ago, that Don Zimmer, a longtime major league player and manager, was married at home plate. There are nine home games left, and the team is chugging along in mid-pack. The mascot? "We hung ours in effigy a couple of years ago," said Clyde Small, the team's general manager. "He was not too exciting and we decided to get rid of him."  Utica Blue Sox</p>
        <p>Donovan Stadium, Utica, N.Y. Class A, Boston Red Sox affiliate, 322 miles from New York City.</p>
        <p>Donovan Stadium, renovated in 1985, offers straighforward, no-frills baseball. It's 325 feet down the lines, 401 feet to straightaway centerfield. Even the promotions stick to the basics: Strike-O-Toss and the ever-popular bat race, a minor league staple, in which contestants must touch their foreheads to a baseball bat, circle quickly around it and then, hopelessly dizzy, race to a base. This is routinely described by front-office people as being hilarious beyond description. Where Major League Addicts Can Get a Minor League Fix</p>
