        <p>The 1994 Goodwill Games lost nearly $40 million, yet the event's president said yesterday that the deficit hasn't diminished thoughts of expanding the competition. "We're not going to try to pull our wings in and get conservative," JACK KELLY said yesterday in a conference call from St. Petersburg, Russia.</p>
        <p>The games, which ended Sunday in St. Petersburg, were $13 million in the red before the opening day. The television ratings, which Kelly said were "in the 1.3.-1.4 range," were less than one half of what was guaranteed to United States advertisers, adding another $26 million to the loss, Kelly said.
