        <p>To the Editor: Having recently lunched at the Grand Vefour, I can second Sarah Ferrell's appraisal of the quality of its food and service ("Dining a Deux, Splendidly," July 3). And it doesn't have to carry such a price tag.</p>
        <p>We had wanted to dine there for years but were wary of the cost and so decided to try lunch instead of dinner. We made a reservation a week in advance, and I asked if we could be seated at Colette's table.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Having recently lunched at the Grand Vefour, I can second Sarah Ferrell's appraisal of the quality of its food and service ("Dining a Deux, Splendidly," July 3). And it doesn't have to carry such a price tag.</p>
        <p>We had wanted to dine there for years but were wary of the cost and so decided to try lunch instead of dinner. We made a reservation a week in advance, and I asked if we could be seated at Colette's table.</p>
        <p>We presented ourselves promptly at 1 P.M. The maitresse d' seemed to be expecting us, because when I gave her my name she didn't refer to a reservation list. She took the canvas bag I was carrying and did not give me a check for it. Then she said something to a waiter who took us directly to a very good table. I was quite impressed with such a smooth operation and then I remembered, I had asked for Colette's table. Sure enough we found a brass plate with her name.</p>
        <p>The service began just as described but when the wine steward approached us with the list, I announced in my serviceable French that we would be having mineral water. He asked, "Uniquement?" and the expression on his face led me to believe we had fallen from grace.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, the Perrier was brought in a wine cooler and no fewer than four waiters came to fill our glasses during our lunch.</p>
        <p>Any sign that we lacked for something and a waiter was immediately at our side. And so it went without a hitch, the procession of petits fours, the cheese platter, the dessert, the coffee, the chocolates etc. Quel luxe!</p>
        <p>The bill for the two of us was $140, but such service inspired us to leave a good tip in addition to the 15 percent service compris. VINCENT J. MENDOLA  Huntington, L. I.</p>
