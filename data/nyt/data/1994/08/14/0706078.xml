        <p>Kim Philby's life makes sense only if one assumes that he belonged to the last imperialist British generation, who despised the upstart Germans, resented the upcoming Americans and who used the Soviets to counterbalance the intrusions of both into the British spheres of interest ("Kim Philby and the Age of Paranoia," by Ron Rosenbaum, July 10).</p>
        <p>In their end game, Philby and friends tried not to betray each other, but only whom they considered lesser breeds, especially those who worked with Americans. When this double play began to dawn on their American partners, the British political establishment could cover its tracks only by sacrificing Philby, reluctantly, and gradually presenting him as a longtime Soviet agent.</p>

        <p>This defeat of hubris, albeit deserved, was not lost on the players, least on Philby himself. GEORGE THUROCZY Vero Beach, Fla.</p>
