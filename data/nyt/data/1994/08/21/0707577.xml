        <p>If the graphs the Department of Education submitted last week with its latest report card on student achievement levels were EKG results, they would describe a patient who was dead. There was some sign of life in math and science. But reading and writing showed barely a ripple of improvement over 20 years.</p>
        <p>Back in 1957, when Sputnik was launched, the fervor for meeting the Soviet challenge generated an explosion of science training and research. But a decade after the 1983 report "A Nation at Risk" alerted America to broad failures in education, the news is not much better.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most troubling statistics involve those who have already made their way through the school system. According to the report, only 2 percent of 11th graders can write effectively with "supportive details and discussion" though they all could "respond to tasks in abbreviated, disjointed, or unclear ways."</p>
        <p>If one segment of the department's own report was any indication, the students were in good company. On page 227, a student writing sample described a haunted house: "Man builds stange house to scare ghosts. . . . for instince there are staires that go nowhere, doors that go nowhere and hallways that go nowhere."</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the sample itself went nowhere. Not only did the text fail to explain what the example was supposed to show, it also neglected to mention an important detail -- how old the student was. CATHERINE S. MANEGOLD</p>
