        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The way that conservative intellectuals have been "more effective in getting their ideas across to the public" is that they have been saying what the commercial and largely conservative media have wanted the public to hear (news article, Aug. 9). This has created the appearance that serious debate in this country is between liberals and conservatives.</p>
        <p>However, among large numbers of those interested in public issues, especially at universities, the debate is between liberals and those to their left. It involves greater numbers of people, with more influence, than did discussions around the old Partisan Review (often taken to represent a flowering of intellectual life).</p>
        <p>And how could anyone write an article on intellectual trends without mentioning feminism? Feminist academics have been writing for, speaking with and reaching very large numbers of people in addition to students for more than two decades. Participants in these discussions have learned from one another and had a considerable influence on the entire culture. VIRGINIA HELD  Prof. of Philosophy, Graduate School and University Center, CUNY New York, Aug. 11, 1994</p>
