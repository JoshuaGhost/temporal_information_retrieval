        <p>A small stretch of the Upper West Side would like to add a category to their index of problems, which already include everything from aggressive panhandlers to car thieves and drug dealers. The addition: green thieves.</p>
        <p>John Olund, a tenor who lives at 319 West 106th Street, said his building had been hit four times in the last month. First, somebody made off with two two-foot-high potted plants from the locked vestibule. Then, a planter wired to the fence disappeared. After that, a honeysuckle bush in a very heavy metal container vanished. Last week, somebody pulled a window box full of impatiens, begonias, salvia and geraniums through a window grill.</p>

        <p>A small stretch of the Upper West Side would like to add a category to their index of problems, which already include everything from aggressive panhandlers to car thieves and drug dealers. The addition: green thieves.</p>
        <p>John Olund, a tenor who lives at 319 West 106th Street, said his building had been hit four times in the last month. First, somebody made off with two two-foot-high potted plants from the locked vestibule. Then, a planter wired to the fence disappeared. After that, a honeysuckle bush in a very heavy metal container vanished. Last week, somebody pulled a window box full of impatiens, begonias, salvia and geraniums through a window grill.</p>
        <p>"It's very upsetting," Mr. Olund said.</p>
        <p>A wave of plant thefts has occurred from 102d to 110th Streets, near Riverside Drive, said Leon Auerbach, a graphic designer who is president of the 106th Street Block Association. Just last week, a new four-foot evergreen was uprooted from Straus Park, the green triangle at Broadway and West End Avenue.</p>
        <p>Some residents say it's just a more extreme version of the pilfering that has been going on for years. Maria Arzeno has been planting flowers in front of her brownstone at 306 West 106th Street for three years, only to have them uprooted overnight. Mrs. Arzeno said that this year, for the first time, the thieves are carting off plants in broad daylight.</p>
        <p>Five weeks ago, Robert Randall, an editor who lives on Riverside Drive at 104th Street, caught a man digging up a begonia from a tree pit at 7 A.M. The man apologized but came back a couple of days later "and cleaned out every plant on the block," Mr. Randall said.</p>
        <p>Where do the plants go? Mr. Randall says he has frequently seen people selling stolen plants at an informal market at spots along Broadway and Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>The 24th Precinct has received a number of complaints about plant, tree and flower theft over the past six weeks. "But we haven't seen the stealing or the selling," Officer James Sheerin said, indicating that the department's focus was on more serious problems.</p>
        <p>The thefts have altered planting plans for many residents.</p>
        <p>Sheila Brown, who heads her co-op board's planting committee, saw all her New Guinea begonias disappear last summer, so this year she put in common white and pink impatiens and wildflowers. "Things that won't be stolen," she explained. She also planted an herb garden -- but the rue, a medicinal plant, and oregano have been stolen (the chives, mint and parsley were left alone).</p>
        <p>Members of the 106th Street Block Association, who usually plant impatiens around the trees in the spring and tulips in October, are wondering whether they should bother. "Any planting will be threatened if this pattern of theft continues," Mr. Auerbach said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Randall says the plantings must prevail. "What it comes down to is the ongoing conflict between hunter-gatherers and gardeners," he said. "The gardeners just have to keep reseeding." MARVINE HOWE  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER WEST SIDE</p>
