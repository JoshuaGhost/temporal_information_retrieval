        <p>Xavier Hernandez was being diplomatic about his debut as the Yankee closer. Very diplomatic. So diplomatic that Manager Buck Showalter probably would have wanted to congratulate him for avoiding any potential controversy about the delicate issue.</p>
        <p>Hernandez wants to be the closer, but it is not a demand. Just like the other relievers, Hernandez will wait in the bullpen for the telephone to ring. And when it does, regardless of the inning, he said, he will get prepared to pitch. He did that before the ninth inning yesterday and was impressive in his debut with two strikeouts and his first save in a 5-3 victory over Texas.</p>

        <p>Xavier Hernandez was being diplomatic about his debut as the Yankee closer. Very diplomatic. So diplomatic that Manager Buck Showalter probably would have wanted to congratulate him for avoiding any potential controversy about the delicate issue.</p>
        <p>Hernandez wants to be the closer, but it is not a demand. Just like the other relievers, Hernandez will wait in the bullpen for the telephone to ring. And when it does, regardless of the inning, he said, he will get prepared to pitch. He did that before the ninth inning yesterday and was impressive in his debut with two strikeouts and his first save in a 5-3 victory over Texas.</p>
        <p>"When Wednesday comes, if he brings me in the game in the seventh or eighth inning, that's O.K.," Hernandez said. What's the Plan?</p>
        <p>That is also unlikely. Maybe this has been Showalter's strategy all along. Once the Yankees acquired Hernandez from the Astros, it was believed that the setup man would become the closer for a team that botched 19 save chances last year. But Hernandez was erratic and injured during spring training and the Yankees emerged with the closer by committee. Now Hernandez's split-finger fastball might help him put his imprint on the closer's job.</p>
        <p>"I wouldn't say that after one game," said Showalter, when asked if Hernandez would continue in the role. "You could probably say it anyway."</p>
        <p>Actually, Showalter designated Bob Wickman to handle the toughest at-bats of the game when he opposed Juan Gonzalez, Jose Canseco and Dean Palmer with the potential tying run at the plate in the eighth and maintained the 5-3 lead. Hernandez surged through the ninth, whiffing Doug Strange and Manuel Lee with the best split-finger pitches that catcher Mike Stanley has seen him throw. Wickman, who is also a candidate to be the closer, enjoyed being placed in the difficult spot in the eighth and was also diplomatic about who pitches the ninth.</p>
        <p>"I think they'll put us out there until someone explodes and goes off," Wickman said. "It doesn't really matter to me."  BASEBALL</p>
