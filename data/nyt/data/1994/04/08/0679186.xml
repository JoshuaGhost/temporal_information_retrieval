        <p>They have always tried to keep it from being an awkward situation. Eric Hillman and Pete Schourek met in 1987 in an instructional league in St. Petersburg.

        <p>They have always tried to keep it from being an awkward situation. Eric Hillman and Pete Schourek met in 1987 in an instructional league in St. Petersburg. Both left-handed pitchers with potential, they became close friends and roommates that fall -- their first in the Mets' system -- and, in many ways, they have been lumped together ever since.</p>
        <p>That all changed today. Hillman is still scheduled to make his first start of the season on Friday night in Houston, when he pitches for the Mets against the Astros. But Schourek won't be there. This afternoon, he was claimed from the waiver wire by the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
        <p>And so a difficult spring training competition between friends has ended this way: Hillman was given the coveted fifth spot in the rotation and Schourek was given a ticket out of town. Schourek was expected to join the Reds for their game against Philadelphia in Cincinnati on Friday; the Mets will purchase the contract of a Class AAA pitcher, Doug Linton, to fill the spot on their roster. 'Nice to Start All Over'</p>
        <p>"I learned a lot of lessons last year, and one was that stuff's going to happen no matter what, so there is no sense beating myself over the head about it," said Schourek, who appeared resigned to leaving the Mets after the team's 4-1 victory over Chicago on Wednesday. "I think it will be nice to start all over. I've always wanted to be with the same team my whole career, but that just doesn't happen very much anymore."</p>
        <p>The Mets' decision to place Schourek on waivers on Monday told him all he needed to know about his status with the club. After his three up-and-down seasons that used all his options and after a public feud with the manager that left him out of favor, the Mets apparently decided to give up on his left arm. No organization likes to lose a left-handed pitcher, but when the Mets placed Schourek on waivers, they had to have known there was very little chance he would not be claimed by another club.</p>
        <p>"We thought this was the most opportune time to try and get him through waivers," said Mets General Manager Joe McIlvaine, who waited until other teams set their 25-man rosters before making the move. "We took a gamble and we lost."</p>
        <p>Schourek and Hillman entered spring training in competition with Anthony Young and Bobby Jones for the fourth and fifth spots in the starting rotation, with the assumption being that one of the two left-handers would be used as a starter. Both out of options, neither Schourek nor Hillman could be sent down to the minors without first having to clear waivers, and both assumed one of them would be gone by the time the season started. Their predictions came true, just a few days late. Friendly Relationship</p>
        <p>"We never let the competition get in the way," Hillman said. "Our relationship is a friendly, goofing-around, hanging-out-after-the-games kind of thing. There are a lot of guys competing here, and I don't think they're fortunate to be as good friends as we are."</p>
        <p>While Schourek seemed to be all but ignored by Manager Dallas Green in recent days, Hillman appears to be gaining in favor, despite Green's occasional vocal frustration with him. On Monday against the Cubs, Green brought Hillman in to face Karl (Tuffy) Rhodes, who had homered three times against Dwight Gooden. It wasn't all that surprising that Green used Hillman for that particular at-bat -- after all, it was lefty vs. lefty What came as a shock, though, was Green's decision to leave Hillman in after he walked Rhodes and with Ryne Sandberg coming to the plate with runners in scoring position. Sandberg has a .304 career batting average against left-handers.</p>
        <p>"That was Dallas's way of showing confidence in me and that meant something," Hillman said. "I thought for sure he was going to take me out."</p>
        <p>Sandberg flied out deep to end the inning. INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets will try to win their fourth consecutive game, against GREG SWINDELL and the Astros in Houston on Friday night. The Mets last started the season with four straight victories in 1985, when they were 5-0 before losing. . . . BRET SABERHAGEN will make his season debut on Saturday night, his first day of eligibility after serving a five-day suspension for last season's bleach-spraying incident. Saberhagen is expected to face Houston's PETE HARNISCH, with PETE SMITH scheduled to pitch against DOUG DRABEK Sunday afternoon.  BASEBALL</p>
