        <p>Nicole Eisenman</p>
        <p>Jack Tilton Gallery  47-49 Greene Street  SoHo  Through May 7</p>
        <p>This show of recent work by the 28-year-old Nicole Eisenman is among the smartest, funniest, most inventive solo exhibitions of the season. Tilton's walls are crammed with dozens of unframed drawings and paintings whose mini-narratives, visual puns and mythological burlesques, executed in a fluid draftsmanly style, bring Reginald Marsh and comic-book fantasy together in audacious combinations.</p>

        <p>Nicole Eisenman</p>
        <p>Jack Tilton Gallery  47-49 Greene Street  SoHo  Through May 7</p>
        <p>This show of recent work by the 28-year-old Nicole Eisenman is among the smartest, funniest, most inventive solo exhibitions of the season. Tilton's walls are crammed with dozens of unframed drawings and paintings whose mini-narratives, visual puns and mythological burlesques, executed in a fluid draftsmanly style, bring Reginald Marsh and comic-book fantasy together in audacious combinations.</p>
        <p>That Ms. Eisenman is a lesbian is very much a part of her art, and feminist images of women with women recur in her work. Among them, for example, is a witches' Sabbath depicted as a sensuous, all-female floating orgy and a bloody tableau in which Leda, with a little help from her friends, finesses that creepy swan problem once and for all.</p>
        <p>But a hard-line political reading of Ms. Eisenman's work really misses the point. The artist is just as ready to send up her own image as anyone else's (check out the photo of her standing, bright-eyed and beribboned, among her slavish "studio staff"). Her melange of funnies, porn and Saturday Evening Post pieties is inspirationally perverse. And her straightforward drawing of homeless men standing around a fire or her charming picture titled "Sleepwalking to Work," with a barefoot, briefcase-toting man and woman carrying their bed strapped to their shoulders, are images any city dweller can identify with. They're all part of a show in which provocative ideas go whizzing by at every turn and where confrontation and humor -- surely the subversive strategy -- meet in audacious combinations. Be there.
