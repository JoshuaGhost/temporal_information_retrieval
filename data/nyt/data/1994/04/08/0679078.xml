        <p>The shocking announcement today that Japan's embattled Prime Minister, Morihiro Hosokawa, intends to resign put stock prices into a temporary tailspin.</p>
        <p>But analysts said the news created a sense of uncertainty rather than panic, and the world's second-largest market later rebounded to close slightly higher for the day.</p>
        <p>Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange had been hovering earlier in the day, having changed little, when the news about Mr. Hosokawa hit the wires early this afternoon. Immediately, the Nikkei index of 225 issues plummeted about 300 points from its midday level, hitting a low of about 19,520.</p>
        <p>But analysts said that, despite the obvious uncertainty the resignation announcement has created, there were some potential positives, at least in the short term. Those prospects caused prices to rebound, although most investors retreated to the sidelines.</p>
        <p>At the close, the Nikkei index stood at 19,934.99, up 44.01 points, or about two-tenths of 1 percent, for the day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hosokawa had been well received by the stock market because of his strong rhetoric backing deregulation of the economy, a strong stimulus to end the recession and an end to the political corruption that brought down a string of governments in recent years.</p>
        <p>But he failed to deliver on his promises and his economic stimulus packages were generally regarded as modest at best. Then, in recent weeks, he was swallowed up by a money scandal, which is what eventually brought him down today.</p>
        <p>For the market, the worst problem was that battling over the scandal, which involved a loan from a trucking company at the center of other scandals, held up passage of the Government's budget. The new fiscal year began April 1 without a budget in place.</p>
        <p>Because the budget included big spending increases to try to infuse new life into the economy, investors worried that the delay could forestall an economic recovery. It is now expected that at least a makeshift budget will be passed, even if the process of choosing a new Prime Minister drags on.</p>
        <p>"The market is very dependent right now on getting an economic recovery," said Geoffrey Barker, the chief economist here with Baring Securities. "So if this helps pass a budget, that is a plus for the market."</p>
        <p>He added that the resignation could also remove another source of uncertainty, heavy American pressure for a trade agreement from Japan. The American Government is expected to moderate its demands, at least until a new Prime Mininster is in place, Mr. Barker said.</p>
        <p>"Over the long term this could be a problem because it could remove the momentum for deregulation, which was positive for the market," said Tim Hayashida, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan. "But the deadlock on the budget had people worried. This may clear that up."</p>
        <p>Tokyo stocks generally held up well through the international financial turbulence of the past month. The jump in interest rates in the United States pushed rates up here slightly, and the plunge in American stock prices created jitters. But the market has clung to its optimism that the deep two-year-old recession will lift later this year.</p>
        <p>"We'd fallen less than in New York here because people have taken a wait-and-see attitude on the economy," Mr. Barker said. "Even with today's news, we're still in that position."</p>
