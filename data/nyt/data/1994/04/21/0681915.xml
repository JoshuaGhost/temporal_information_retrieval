        <p>Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Company said yesterday that its net income for the first quarter rose 54 percent, to $209.5 million, or $1.23 a share. The company's credit card and stock brokerage units both performed well.</p>
        <p>Philip J. Purcell, Dean Witter's chairman, said in an interview that the profits in the credit card business were surprisingly high. "The lower credit write-offs and revenue increases proved more positive than we had expected, but the trends in the basic business were what we expected," he said.</p>
        <p>The biggest growth came from its Discover credit card operation, which increased profits 85 percent, to $124 million, mainly because card holders spent more and borrowed more. Loans related to the card increased 15 percent, to $20.5 billion; fees, both from merchants and card holders, rose 26 percent, to $241.9 million. Over all, the number of accounts increased 9 percent, to 29.6 million.</p>
        <p>Profits at its Dean Witter securities arm, which has the country's third-largest army of stockbrokers, advanced 24 percent, to $85.5 million. Commissions were up 9 percent, to $247.6 million, but trading revenue fell 19 percent, to $92.4 million, mainly because of lower bond trading, the company said. Fees from asset management increased 24 percent, to $240.3 million.  COMPANY REPORTS</p>
