        <p>TENNIS  Fatigued Fernandez Foiled in 2d Round  Mary Joe Fernandez, whose fragile health continues to have a negative impact on her play, yesterday became the first highly seeded upset victim at the Bausch &amp; Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Fla. Fernandez, seeded fifth, was eliminated in a second-round match, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2, by 144th-ranked Petra Langrova of the Czech Republic. Fernandez has not won a tournament in more than a year. She had not competed since February when her title defense at Indian Wells, Calif., ended prematurely with a loss to Amanda Coetzer in the quarterfinals. Fernandez underwent surgery last year for endometriosis, a gynecological condition, and continues to experience side effects from the medication she takes to prevent the problem from recurring. Yesterday she complained of fatigue, but she attributed the loss to Langrova's dogged and error-free play in the third set. In other matches, third-seeded Martina Navratilova defeated Silke Frankl, 6-1, 6-1; sixth-seeded Lindsay Davenport trounced Radka Bobkova, 6-3, 6-0; Coetzer downed Larisa Neiland, 6-2, 6-2, and seventh-seeded Mary Pierce defeated Irina Spirlea, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4). Top-Seeded Players Win: Pete Sampras, Michael Chang and Boris Becker won second-round matches in the Japan Open in Tokyo. Sampras, the defending champion, scored a 6-3, 7-6 (7-5) victory over a Russian, Andrei Olhovskiy. Chang rebounded from a 1-5 deficit in the second set for a 6-1, 7-6 (7-2) victory over his fellow American Doug Flach. Becker beat a Frenchman, Stephane Simian, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). (AP)</p>

        <p>Bruguera Survives: Second-seeded Sergi Bruguera avoided the upsets that eliminated two other seeded players and defeated a fellow Spaniard, Francisco Clavet, in the second round of the Conde de Godo tournament in Barcelona, Spain. Bruguera beat Clavet, 6-0, 6-1, in the clay-court event. The defending champion, Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine, seeded No. 3, was defeated by Haiti's Ronald Agenor, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-3. (AP) N.H.L.  Senators Shock the Capitals  The rookie center Aleksei Yashin had a goal and three assists as the Ottawa Senators came from behind to beat the visiting Washington Capitals, 6-5, last night. The loss was the third in a row for the Capitals, who are 3 points ahead of Florida, 4 ahead of the Islanders and 6 ahead of Philadelphia in the Eastern Conference race for the final two playoff spots. (AP) Lightning 3, Canadiens 1: Jason Ruff and John Tucker scored in the second period to lead visiting Tampa Bay to victory over Montreal. (AP) BOXING  Pazienza's Next Opponent Will Be Duran  Vinny Pazienza's unanimous decision over Jacques LeBlanc of Canada on Tuesday night set the stage for a showdown with Roberto Duran in June. Pazienza raised his record to 37-5 in the 10-round supermiddleweight bout at the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Gambling Casino in Ledyard, Conn. (AP) SOCCER  Zambia, Nigeria Advance to Title Game  Zambia advanced to the championship game of the African Nations Cup by routing Mali, 4-0, yesterday in Tunis. Elija Litana, Zede Saileti, Kalusha Bwalya and Kenneth Molitoli scored for Zambia, which missed qualifying for this summer's World Cup in the United States when it lost to Morocco last October. In Sunday's final, Zambia will play Nigeria, which beat the defending champion, Ivory Coast, by 4-2 on penalty kicks after a 2-2 tie. (AP) ROWING  Princeton Claims Childs Cup Prize  Princeton won the Childs Cup, America's oldest rowing trophy, by sweeping Pennsylvania and Columbia yesterday in all four events of the regatta. Princeton's varsity victory was its first since 1988, and the biggest for Coach Curtis Jordan in his four-year tenure at the Tiger helm. The event, held in Princeton, N.J., was first contested in 1879. (AP)</p>
