        <p>After a setback in which a key development partner dropped out, plans to breathe new life into La Marqueta, the once-vibrant marketplace on upper Park Avenue, seem to be on track again, officials involved with the project said.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 20, the city granted a Harlem-based nonprofit organization, the Puerto Rican Association for Community Affairs, conditional approval to revive the market in partnership with Gilbert Rivera, owner of a Brooklyn construction and retail company.</p>
        <p>The association beat three other contenders for the project and was given until the end of July to demonstrate that it could come up with a viable plan. It was also required to prove that it could secure the money to complete it.</p>
        <p>But, after long negotiations with the city and the association, Mr. Rivera withdrew from the project in late January. He left after being told that the association would have final say on plans for the rebuilding, said Mr. Rivera and Yolanda Sanchez, director of the association.</p>
        <p>The renewal is expected to cost between $12 million and $15 million.</p>
        <p>The assistance of a developer like Mr. Rivera is essential for the project, Ms. Sanchez said. "As a not-for-profit we had to have a business with the ability to go into banks and get loans," she said. "We had to have somebody with deep pockets and we didn't have that."</p>
        <p>Architects and management consultants, however, have already drawn up basic plans, which would renovate the market's five original buildings, nestled under the Metro-North railroad viaduct between 111th Street and 116th Street, and add two more buildings to the north that would include a movie theater, a food court, a day-care center and health clinic, Ms. Sanchez said.</p>
        <p>After interviewing eight large construction companies, Ms. Sanchez said she found another developer early this month. The company's finances are under review by the city's Economic Development Corporation, which still controls La Marqueta. Neither Ms. Sanchez nor the Economic Development Corporation would identify the company until it has been approved, which is expected by month's end..</p>
        <p>But city officials, including those on the Mayor's Task Force for La Marqueta, set up by former Mayor Dinkins, say the change of developers may actually be helpful.</p>
        <p>Edward L. Baca, a member of the task force, said revival of the market has always been slow because developers have not had East Harlem's interests at heart. Two efforts have already failed, one in the mid-1980's and another two years ago, both mounted by groups allied with Democratic Assemblyman Angelo Del Toro.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baca said that Mr. Rivera was never entirely comfortable with allowing a community organization to make the decisions. "We've had those types of problems before and we didn't want to have them again," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera said he was also uncomfortable with what he felt was political maneuvering that accompanied the project, which some have seen as a symbol of the decline of Mr. Del Toro's power..</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanchez said she bears no ill will toward Mr. Rivera and that the withdrawal delayed the project by only about two weeks.</p>
        <p>"I think it's really going to happen this time," she said. RANDY KENNEDY  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM</p>
