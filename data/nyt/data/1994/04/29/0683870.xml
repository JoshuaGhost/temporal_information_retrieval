        <p>Jack Pierson</p>
        <p>Luhring Augustine  130 Prince Street  SoHo  Through May 7</p>
        <p>Jack Pierson is a romantic whose subject is beauty, loneliness, unrequited love and the basic discomfort of getting through the day. He's also a stylish iconoclast who works in several media with studied disregard for esthetic hierarchies and divisions: his drawings can seem illustrational; his hazy photographs of flowers and transvestites, inept; his interests literary, almost cinematic. His wall pieces, made from the wood and metal letters of discarded signs, spell out words whose ineffable poignancy has the clear, unrestrained emotionalism of popular culture. In all, his artistic ancestors would seem to include Warhol, Hockney and Piaf.</p>

        <p>Jack Pierson</p>
        <p>Luhring Augustine  130 Prince Street  SoHo  Through May 7</p>
        <p>Jack Pierson is a romantic whose subject is beauty, loneliness, unrequited love and the basic discomfort of getting through the day. He's also a stylish iconoclast who works in several media with studied disregard for esthetic hierarchies and divisions: his drawings can seem illustrational; his hazy photographs of flowers and transvestites, inept; his interests literary, almost cinematic. His wall pieces, made from the wood and metal letters of discarded signs, spell out words whose ineffable poignancy has the clear, unrestrained emotionalism of popular culture. In all, his artistic ancestors would seem to include Warhol, Hockney and Piaf.</p>
        <p>"Still," "Like Someone Alone" and "Anyone" are some of the word pieces that punctuate this carefully orchestrated installation of drawings, watercolors, photographs and the artist's first attempts at painting. A meditation on blue as color and mood, it begins with a slouchy, bohemian tableau: a translucent blue silk shirt hanging on an old folding chair with stubbed-out cigarettes at its feet.</p>
        <p>One thing leads to another: 10 small white-on-black drawings of a left hand, presumably the artist's, holding a burning cigarette; then a sequence of abstract paintings on paper whose repeating strokes of blue have a surprising variety of mood and tone, but also a time-filling aspect, not unlike smoking.</p>
        <p>Everything works together in a loose, open-ended way, and the overall look is strikingly original; but it's hard to know how many of these works will stand on their own. The delicate balance between style and subject inherent in Mr. Pierson's art seems to be tipping too completely toward style, and, excepting the photographs and word pieces, toward opacity, which is unusual for an artist who has always made transparency of feeling his hallmark.
