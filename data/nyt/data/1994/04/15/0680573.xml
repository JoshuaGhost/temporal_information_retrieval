        <p>As the end of the regular hockey and basketball seasons nears, Knicks and Rangers fans are girding to face the crucial question brought on by the approaching playoffs: Where should we eat before the game?</p>
        <p>Madison Square Garden? Well, a hot dog is nice every once in a while, but what about a real meal?</p>
        <p>Many savvy fans have already discovered one possibility: Biricchino. This serviceable Italian restaurant has the exceptional good fortune to be owned by the same people who own Salumeria Biellese, the renowned sausage maker around the block on Eighth Avenue, which provides sausages and charcuterie to some of the best restaurants in town. Many of these sausages are also served at Biricchino (pronounced bee-ree-KEEN-oh), and while some of them look just like the hot dogs at Madison Square Garden, they are in a completely different league.</p>

        <p>As the end of the regular hockey and basketball seasons nears, Knicks and Rangers fans are girding to face the crucial question brought on by the approaching playoffs: Where should we eat before the game?</p>
        <p>Madison Square Garden? Well, a hot dog is nice every once in a while, but what about a real meal?</p>
        <p>Many savvy fans have already discovered one possibility: Biricchino. This serviceable Italian restaurant has the exceptional good fortune to be owned by the same people who own Salumeria Biellese, the renowned sausage maker around the block on Eighth Avenue, which provides sausages and charcuterie to some of the best restaurants in town. Many of these sausages are also served at Biricchino (pronounced bee-ree-KEEN-oh), and while some of them look just like the hot dogs at Madison Square Garden, they are in a completely different league.</p>
        <p>The best strategy at Biricchino, a pleasant, plain little place with marble floors and marble tables, is to go directly for the sausage and charcuterie. An appetizer of mixed grilled sausages ($5.25) with a salad and bread could make a full meal, particularly if you want to leave room for beer at the game. The sausages change daily, depending on what's fresh, but might include sweet combinations like chicken and apricot or duck with grand marnier and orange peel, spicy sausages like North African merguez, robust garlic sausages and other savory combinations like chicken and lemongrass or rabbit and chanterelles. The garlic sausage is also served in a flaky puff pastry ($5.25).</p>
        <p>Another possibility is the antipasto Biricchino ($5.75), an array of charcuterie that might include paper-thin slices of wonderfully hammy prosciutto, wide rounds of peppery salami and narrow rounds of garlic sausage, soppressata, sweet dry-cured coppa and fresh mozzarella, all on a bed of arugula. The only main course with sausage, alas, is an earthy peasant dish of rigatoni with crumbled sausage and sun-dried tomato ($10.95): delicious, though the sun-dried tomato seems as appropriate as a farmer in an Armani suit.</p>
        <p>The rest of the menu is standard Italian, with some good dishes but nothing surprising. A simple mixed green salad ($4.95) is perfectly dressed, and an assortment of fresh mushrooms, grilled in butter and wine ($6.95), is marvelous. A special of bow-tie pasta in a creamy primavera sauce ($11.95) with fresh carrots, green beans and artichokes achieved flavor without sacrificing lightness. But cavatelli in a ricotta and tomato sauce ($11.95) was served in an unappetizing glop.</p>
        <p>Other entrees like veal piccata ($16.95) and pollo Biricchino ($14.95), a breaded chicken breast with cheese and prosciutto, are unremarkable. Desserts, like tiramisu and gelati ($4.95 each), are also passable. Service is swift and attentive, and a plate of luscious chocolate truffles leaves a generous taste in the mouth when paying the bill.</p>
        <p>Game nights are pretty crowded at Biricchino, with, as the conventional wisdom goes, capacity crowds before Knicks games and three-quarters-full crowds before Rangers games. Also, the waitresses say, Knicks fans are better tippers. One more reason for the Rangers' long history of failure? Biricchino  260 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 695-6690.</p>
        <p>Best dishes: Mixed grilled sausages, garlic sausage in puff pastry, antipasto Biricchino, rigatoni with crumbled sausage and sun-dried tomato, mixed green salad, bow ties primavera.</p>
