        <p>At the time of year when star colts are being scouted and sighted at the races, a 3-year-old filly named Dixie Luck blossomed as a star yesterday when she won the Comely Stakes at Aqueduct. It was her fourth victory in five starts in an almost flawless career.</p>
        <p>Thus, she staked out a strong position for the Triple Tiara series for fillies in New York, which opens with the Acorn Stakes on May 8. And she arrives with major credentials. She is a dark brown daughter of Dixieland Band; she is owned by Allaire duPont and trained by Allen Jerkens, and she has missed the winner's circle only once.</p>

        <p>Thus, she staked out a strong position for the Triple Tiara series for fillies in New York, which opens with the Acorn Stakes on May 8. And she arrives with major credentials. She is a dark brown daughter of Dixieland Band; she is owned by Allaire duPont and trained by Allen Jerkens, and she has missed the winner's circle only once.</p>
        <p>Dixie Luck won by the length of her neck over Penny's Reshoot, who had a length and a half on Our Royal Blue. The winner ran the mile in 1 minute 37 seconds, returned $6.40 for a $2 wager and went home with a first prize of $66,240.</p>
        <p>As for Kentucky Derby-bound colts, a field of 11 will compete today in the $600,000 Jim Beam Stakes at Turfway Park in Florence, Ky. The favorite, at 3-1, is Southern Rhythm, who was also sired by Dixieland Band. At the southern end of the road to Louisville, a field of 10 will race in the $200,000 Flamingo Stakes tomorrow at Hialeah Park in Florida. The favorite at even money or less is Canaveral.
