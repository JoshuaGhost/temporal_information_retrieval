        <p>MOST home power tools are used just occasionally, and years may elapse before problems develop. But to prevent an electric drill's quitting when atop a ladder or a circular saw's going through a sheet of plywood, there are maintenance hints.</p>
        <p>Always be sure that the tool receives full power. Use an adequate extension cord, with 12-gauge wires. Do not use a cord with smaller 14-gauge wires, even if it is labeled heavy duty. Never use an ordinary household extension cord. Inadequate power causes motor parts to overheat, eventually ruining them.</p>
        <p>Avoid coiling extension cords too tightly when storing. That strains the coverings. Avoid wrapping the cord tightly around the tool. Instead, gather cords loosely in coils about a foot in diameter and fasten them with garbage-bag ties or stout rubber bands.</p>
        <p>After each day's use, wipe power tools free of as much dust as possible. Dust buildup, especially on saws, sanders and routers, contributes to overheating by preventing cooling air from reaching motor parts and switches. Many professionals use compressed air to blow away dust. If a compressor is handy, blow air into the intake opening while the tool is running.</p>
        <p>If you have been using a tool fairly often for more than two years, inspect the brushes that supply power to the motor. On most tools, the brushes are accessible by removing two slotted plugs opposite each other near one end of the motor.</p>
        <p>Loosen the plugs by turning them counterclockwise with a screwdriver. Release the plugs slowly, as most brushes are spring-loaded and can pop out. If what appears to be a paper disk is beneath a plug, withdraw it carefully with tweezers. A spring-loaded brush pushes against it.</p>
        <p>Brushes on electric motors are small blocks of carbon. Because they rub against a rotating part of the motor called the commutator, they gradually wear down. If a brush has worn unevenly or is shorter than its width, replace both brushes.</p>
        <p>Also replace the brushes if one or both is pitted or a spring is damaged. Reinstall serviceable brushes by putting them back in their original positions.</p>
        <p>If a switch has malfunctioned, if the cord is damaged or if dust has clogged a tool, disassemble and repair it. That is not difficult, provided you proceed slowly and note the positions of all parts. To be sure of reassembling the items correctly, set them down in the order they were removed. You might even consider sketching, photographing or videotaping the disassembly.</p>
        <p>Inspecting just the switch and power cord may be accomplished on some tools simply by removing screws from the handle to separate its halves or by removing a cover from the end or top of the tool. Use a small paintbrush or an old toothbrush to clean dust. Next, inspect the individual wires of the cord and those attached to the switch for looseness, breaks or burns.</p>
        <p>Renewing faulty connections is usually sufficient for loose or damaged wiring, but burned terminals may call for new switches. A damaged cord has to be replaced with a new one or reconnected after severing it below the damaged area. Before disconnecting a switch or cord, sketch all wires and their terminals. If the wires are secured with screws or connectors, loosening the screws or separating the connectors will free them.  To release wires entering push-in sockets in the switch, try inserting one end of a sturdy paper clip into the switch alongside the wire or into a slot next to the opening. Press on the paper clip while tugging the wire. If that does not work, try prying the core of the switch, which contains the wires, from the shell. As a last resort, take the tool to a repair store.</p>
        <p>Cleaning a badly clogged tool and performing other maintenance requires exposing the motor and sometimes other parts. Proceed slowly and carefully. With the motor exposed, gently brush away dust and rotate the motor shaft. If it does not turn freely, lubricate the ends with one or two drops of lightweight household oil.</p>
        <p>Avoid spilling oil on the slotted copper cylinder, the commutator, or on the motor shaft or touching it with your fingers, which transfers oils. But if the commutator is blackened from contact with the brushes, clean it for better contact.</p>
        <p>Slide the shaft out of the motor, if possible, and polish the commutator gently with 220- or 600-grit sandpaper. Brush all particles and clean the grooves, as that grit can cause a short-circuit. Reassemble the motor.</p>
        <p>Clean internal gears on drills and regrease them by filling the gear case halfway with white (lithium) grease or a kind recommended by the manufacturer. Lightly oil the jaws or chuck. On belt sanders and some orbital sanders, replace the drive belt if it is worn, remove the fan cover and clean the fan.</p>
        <p>On saws, be sure all fasteners are tight and blade guards work smoothly. Clean saws thoroughly and service the drive gear as for drills. To prevent overheating, use a sharp saw blade.  HOME CLINIC</p>
