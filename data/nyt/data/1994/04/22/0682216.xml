        <p>Long before the revisionist western was a glint in Clint Eastwood's eye, there was John Ford. He established the character-driven western with his classic "Stagecoach" in 1939, and by 1956 was probing the moral ambiguities of the frontier in "The Searchers," a film that seems deeper with every viewing. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Ford's birth, the Museum of Modern Art is presenting "John Ford, 1894-1973: An American Master," a series of films from the museum's collection that will run through May 6.</p>
        <p>This weekend's highlight is a new print of "The Searchers." Beloved by western fans and cineastes, this is the John Wayne movie for people who think they don't like John Wayne. As Ethan Edwards, a former Confederate soldier, Wayne goes on an obsessive yearslong search for his niece (Natalie Wood; even Ford wasn't perfect at casting), who had been abducted by Indians. When he finds her, all his certainty about good and evil -- and all moviedom's certainty about cowboys and Indians -- is subjected to fierce moral scrutiny. As in his other great westerns, Ford doesn't stint on action here, or on the grand landscape of Monument Valley. "The Searchers" will be shown tonight at 8 and Sunday afternoon at 2 P.M.</p>

        <p>Along with classics like "Stagecoach," which will be shown tomorrow at 5 P.M., the series includes some early curiosities not available on video. "Up the River" is a 1930 prison comedy starring Spencer Tracy in his first film, and Humphrey Bogart in his second. This is not the film for which Tracy, Bogart or Ford is best known. You can see whether they all got a bum rap tonight at 6.</p>
        <p>Tickets are free with admission to the museum: $7.50 for adults, $4.50 for students and the elderly. The museum is at 11 West 53d Street, Manhattan. Information and screening schedule: (212) 708-9480. CARYN JAMES</p>
