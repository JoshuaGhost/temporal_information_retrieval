        <p>President Boris N. Yeltsin complained bitterly today that Moscow had not been consulted in advance on Sunday as NATO bombers prepared the first air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions near the besieged town of Gorazde.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters as he left Moscow for an official visit to Spain, Mr. Yeltsin said he had registered his objections in a telephone conversation early this morning with President Clinton.</p>
        <p>"I insisted to Clinton time and again that such decisions cannot be taken without prior consultation between the United States and Russia," Mr. Yeltsin said. An Assertive Russian Tone</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin and his Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, have adopted an increasingly assertive tone lately, insisting on Russia's role as an equal player in international crises.</p>
        <p>[ The Russian ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky was even more condemnatory of NATO's actions, telling the Reuters news agency during a visit to Strasbourg, France, that Russia should bomb NATO bases in Italy in response to the NATO strikes near Gorazde. ]</p>
        <p>But Moscow seemed more perturbed by the decision-making process than by the air strikes themselves, which were launched after Serbian artillery commanders ignored warnings to stop their shelling of besieged Muslims.</p>
        <p>The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement today which expressed regret that Moscow had not received prior notice of the attack, but stressed that the order to bomb had been authorized by a resolution of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
        <p>"These violations cannot be tolerated," said the statement, which added that Muslim forces had also resorted to "provocations," which it said were well-known to United Nations officials.  CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS</p>
