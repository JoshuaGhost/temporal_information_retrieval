        <p>The Giuliani administration and the housing police union announced a tentative agreement yesterday on a 39-month contract that provides modest wage and benefit increases for the 2,000-member force, largely tracking the settlement the Dinkins administration reached with the largest municipal unions in early 1993.</p>
        <p>If ratified, the contract would provide an overall wage increase of just over 7 percent, plus a lump-sum payment of $2,000 for all officers on the payroll during 1992. The agreement is retroactive to October 1991 and runs through the end of 1994.</p>

        <p>The Giuliani administration and the housing police union announced a tentative agreement yesterday on a 39-month contract that provides modest wage and benefit increases for the 2,000-member force, largely tracking the settlement the Dinkins administration reached with the largest municipal unions in early 1993.</p>
        <p>If ratified, the contract would provide an overall wage increase of just over 7 percent, plus a lump-sum payment of $2,000 for all officers on the payroll during 1992. The agreement is retroactive to October 1991 and runs through the end of 1994.</p>
        <p>The settlement also brings officers hired since July 1988 the same supplemental retirement benefits as those on the force before then -- a provision that Timothy L. Nickels, the president of the housing police union, cited as particularly important. Randy L. Levine, the city's Labor Commissioner, said the union had also agreed to allow the city to reschedule police officers four more days a year without the payment of overtime. Setting a Pattern</p>
        <p>The contract talks marked the first time one of the smaller police unions bargained first instead of waiting for the 20,000-member Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to set the pattern for all police officers. The police have usually won a better deal than the city's nonuniformed workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine said the city would offer the same package to the other police forces. "We've told all the uniformed forces this is what we're going to do," he said. "Everybody just has to come within the pattern. The city just doesn't have the money to go over the pattern."</p>
        <p>The New York City Police Department, housing police and transit police had all been without a contract since 1991. The transit police union recently declared an impasse and went to the state's Public Employment Relations Board for arbitration.</p>
        <p>Ron Reale, the head of the transit police union, said he was still seeking a better contract. Phil Caruso, the president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine said he thought the contract with the housing police would strengthen the city at arbitration. "New York City has a tradition of parity relationships," he said. "Now you have a New York City police force with an agreement."</p>
