        <p>New works, and works that draw on jazz elements, have always been the heart of Marin Alsop's repertory with her Concordia Orchestra, and in that sense, the ensemble's concert on Saturday evening at Alice Tully Hall was business as usual. One piece, George Bogatko's "Go for It," was hardly even a jazz-classical hybrid: its language, structure and moves were pure jazz, but it was scored for strings rather than for winds. Besides a drum solo, played with spectacular variety and energy by Chris Adams, it included a cello solo, which Erik Friedlander played deftly.</p>
        <p>A lighter jazziness enlivened the latest of Jon Deak's children's works, "The Broccoli Beast of Bedford Avenue," a drama based on a story by Michelle Ellis, a student at P.S. 3 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. In the story, Michelle discovers a broccoli monster in her refrigerator, and after first recoiling (on the ground that he is smelly), she sprays him with perfume, shields him from the police and becomes his pal.</p>

        <p>New works, and works that draw on jazz elements, have always been the heart of Marin Alsop's repertory with her Concordia Orchestra, and in that sense, the ensemble's concert on Saturday evening at Alice Tully Hall was business as usual.

        <p>A lighter jazziness enlivened the latest of Jon Deak's children's works, "The Broccoli Beast of Bedford Avenue," a drama based on a story by Michelle Ellis, a student at P.S. 3 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. In the story, Michelle discovers a broccoli monster in her refrigerator, and after first recoiling (on the ground that he is smelly), she sprays him with perfume, shields him from the police and becomes his pal.</p>
        <p>Cimone Graves, a 9-year-old from P.S. 3, did a fabulous job as Michelle. She had memorized the text and made the character her own, complete with deadpan humor. Wayne du Maine played Mr. Deak's solo trumpet figures -- part jazz, part Stravinsky-style angularity -- with flair, and doubled as the monster, delivering his lines with a Louis Armstrong growl. A chorus from P.S. 3 chimed in with responses to Michelle's observations, in appealingly complex rhythms. Mr. Deak's orchestral fabric supported the goings-on efficiently.</p>
        <p>John Corigliano regards the whole of musical language as his to use, and in "Troubadors," a guitar concerto, he sets medieval troubador melodies and a cinematic vision of antique revelry within a frame of mysterious, rich chromaticism. The piece suits the clean, colorful playing of Sharon Isbin, who commissioned it (with Concordia and three other orchestras). The guitar writing demands everything from speedy runs to introspective chordal figuration, and Ms. Isbin was confidently eloquent at both extremes.</p>
        <p>The program also included a new chamber orchestra version of Richard Danielpour's "First Light," a vividly scored four-movement evocation of the battle between the aggressions of the outer world and more internal, spiritual rumination (spiritualism wins), and Samuel Barber's "Capricorn Concerto." Ms. Alsop and her players delivered consistently alert, lively performances.</p>
