        <p>Within the walls of this ancient Maya stronghold, facing the gemstone sea and sacred structures built long ago, modern Mexico seems blessed with history.</p>
        <p>Outside, history is hell.</p>
        <p>A ramshackle city almost as large as ancient Tulum itself has sprung up just beyond its walls, preying on the thousands of sightseers hauled here every day by smokey buses from the resort city of Cancun, 80 miles away. Broiled by the Yucatan sun, the buses are kept idling so their air-conditioning can run, choking everyone nearby.</p>
        <p>The food stands operate without running water or electricity. Tourists frantically sweep through as many of the 50 or so shops as they can, haggling over quartz daggers, cheap T-shirts and pornographic whistles.</p>
        <p>It is not a pretty sight, but Mexicans are pragmatic and realize that the past, while revered, can also be used to turn a profit. By whom, however, is the issue that has turned Tulum into a battleground, an especially sensitive one because of the Indian unrest in Mexico this year.</p>
        <p>On one side are Government officials who realize that Mexico is rich in history but poor in the resources to care for its past. They have turned to private developers for help, asking them to build a new shopping center about a mile away from Tulum into which vendors can be moved if they are willing to buy space.</p>
        <p>Once the new building is operating, the ragtag shacks -- illegaly located on federal land near the ruins -- will be removed, the bus parking will be relocated alongside the new shops, and the original area will revert to jungle. Motorized carts will take tourists from the buses to the ruins and back.</p>
        <p>Opposed are the vendors themselves, mostly poor people of Maya descent. They say they cannot afford the $22,000 to buy a 15-by-30-foot stall in the new shopping center. The Government has helped make financing available at rates that are somewhat below market, but even these conditions are burdensome to people who say that in the best of times they barely make $10 a day.</p>
        <p>They do not like the idea of moving or of having to compete against outsiders whom the developers are bringing into the shopping center.</p>
        <p>"They want to make history a big business," puffed Antonio Cervantes Sixtos, a T-shirt shop owner and a leader of the disaffected vendors. "We don't want to have any part in it."</p>
        <p>Late last year officials were taking a hard line, threatening to bulldoze any vendors who had not relocated by the end of February. But when Maya Indians in Chiapas rose up in arms on Jan. 1, such a hard line became politically untenable. Deadlines were pushed back, the bulldozers never showed up and the road that leads directly to the walls of Tulum remains open months after it was supposed to be closed.</p>
        <p>Rebeca NussBaum Peniche said she bought a stall in the new concrete building because someone told her it would be a good investment. She also was afraid of the bulldozers. But her space was not finished in time for the scheduled Feb. 15 opening, and since the buses are still allowed to go close to the walls, hardly any tourists stop at the new site.</p>
        <p>She now pays almost $600 a month for the stall, even though she isn't selling a single carved Maya head there.</p>
        <p>"How do I feel? Powerless," she said. "But in truth, to me it seems an offense for them to try to sell Mexico's patrimony this way."</p>
        <p>Though Tulum is far from being the grandest Mayan site, its proximity to major beach resorts makes it the most visited, attracting more than a million visitors a year. But its problems with tacky surroundings are shared by other archeological sites. The pyramids in Teotihuacan, 31 miles northeast of Mexico City and the work not of the Maya but of the precursors of the Toltecs, are encircled by shabby stands and people selling cheap trinkets. Officials are trying to relocate them too.</p>
        <p>The head of the development group that built the shopping center in Tulum thinks the vendors are being shortsighted and unfair.</p>
        <p>"The only thing we're doing is helping the state and federal governments because they don't have the money to dignify the historic site themselves," said Eduardo Rebolledo Stringle, director general of the Tulum Development Group. "If I was buying the archeological zone itself or the ruins, I would agree that Mexico is selling its history. But because our project is 1,500 meters from the ruins, it has nothing to do with that at all."</p>
        <p>At times, the struggle for Tulum has turned ugly. On Feb. 19, bulldozers blocked the old road to the ruins. Not long after, Marcos Cardenas Valdes was stabbed five times in the chest and abdomen because, he said, he refused to move his T-shirt shop.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cervantes, who is president of a union of the vendors, said he had been intimidated, and even received death threats. He said some vendors had been threatened with the loss of their vendors' licenses.</p>
        <p>The vendors know their stands are ugly and disrespectful of the grandeur of Tulum. What they want is the chance to start over again in a new area, but not under the control of outsiders. They say they are just like many of Mexico's poor, tired of watching other people get ahead.</p>
        <p>"If they don't do something about this," Mr. Cervantes said, "we'll end up with the same problem here that they had in Chiapas."</p>
