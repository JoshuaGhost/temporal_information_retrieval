        <p>THEY resemble no other athletes. Halloween masks hide their perspiring faces. Flak-jacket vests impede their torsos. Pads bigger than sofa pillows weigh on their legs. With a thick flat glove, they grip a bulky wooden stick. With their other glove, they try to snatch the puck as a first baseman would. And with all of this ponderous equipment, they must guard a 6-by-4-foot net while spinning, sliding and sprawling on ice.</p>

        <p>THEY resemble no other athletes. Halloween masks hide their perspiring faces. Flak-jacket vests impede their torsos. Pads bigger than sofa pillows weigh on their legs. With a thick flat glove, they grip a bulky wooden stick. With their other glove, they try to snatch the puck as a first baseman would. And with all of this ponderous equipment, they must guard a 6-by-4-foot net while spinning, sliding and sprawling on ice.</p>
        <p>They are goaltenders and this is their time of year.</p>
        <p>In more than a century of Stanley Cup hockey, the winning team invariably has had the hot goaltender. You could fry an egg on his stick. You could boil water in his first baseman's glove.</p>
        <p>"Hot goaltending," Mike Keenan, the Rangers' coach, was saying before the playoffs began, "can take you a long way."</p>
        <p>Last night and early this morning hot goaltending by Martin Brodeur and Dominik Hasek took the Devils and the Sabres into a fourth overtime before Dave Hannan scored on a backhander for the Sabres after 65 minutes 43 minutes of sudden death, ending the third-longest 1-0 overtime game in Stanley Cup history.</p>
        <p>At the end Hasek had made 70 saves, Brodeur 49 -- many of them acrobatic and, as the theater continued, all of them dramatic. Behind their masks, Brodeur, who will be 22 next week has the face of an altar boy while Hasek has the thin, gray 29-year-old face of the Czech Republic, where he had been the Pardubice goaltender starting at age 17. But all anyone saw were their masks.</p>
        <p>Sometime during the regulation 60 minutes and again in the second overtime, those left of the 15,003 spectators chanted, "Mar-tin, Mar-tin," hoping to rattle the Devil goaltender, but he never rattled.</p>
        <p>During the third overtime the remaining spectators roared, "Has-ek, Has-ek" after he had stopped another barrage of Devil shots. Through the third overtime Hasek had made 66 saves, Brodeur 44 -- a total of 110 shots on goal without a goal.</p>
        <p>Seldom has goaltending been hotter. The ice beneath Martin Brodeur and Dominik Hasek should have melted.</p>
        <p>Hot goaltending by Mike Richter helped the Rangers roar into the Eastern Conference semifinals in a 4-0 sweep as the Islanders scored a total of only three goals. Now the Rangers must go against the Washington Capitals and Don Beaupre, the goaltender who foiled the two-time champion Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>
        <p>In the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs, Brodeur and Hasek were only two of several hot goaltenders. Arturs Irbe, the Latvian import, has helped the surprising San Jose Sharks take a 3-2 lead into tonight's sixth game at Detroit in their Western Conference series.</p>
        <p>The Sharks were under .500 for the season with a 33-35-16 record, but with their hot goaltender they are threatening to eliminate the Red Wings, whose 46-30-8 record was the best in the Western Conference.</p>
        <p>The goaltender the Rangers quietly fear is Patrick Roy, who led the Montreal Canadiens to the Stanley Cup a year ago by never allowing an overtime goal in 10 games. After the Bruins' 3-2 victory in Montreal last night, their series will be decided Friday in Boston where Monday night Roy extended his overtime scoreless streak to 113 minutes 57 seconds over 11 games, the fifth-longest in playoff history.</p>
        <p>Now that's hot. Almost as hot as his appendix.</p>
        <p>Roy appeared on his way into surgery last week, but he was treated with antibiotics. After missing one game, which the Canadiens lost, 6-3, with Ron Tugnutt as their goaltender, Roy returned to the net as hot as ever. In Monday night's 2-1 victory, he had 60 saves, 16 in overtime.</p>
        <p>In recent years, Roy has been the hot goaltender who dominated the playoffs, as Tom Barrasso, Grant Fuhr, Billy Smith, Ken Dryden, Bernie Parent, Glenn Hall, Jacques Plante, Terry Sawchuk, Turk Broda and Frank (Mr. Zero) Brimsek did in other years.</p>
        <p>And as Davey Kerr did in 1940 when the Rangers last won the cup.</p>
        <p>But the Devils were hoping Martin Broduer was emerging as this year's hot goaltender. Slava Fetisov, their Russian defenseman, even was willing to compare him to Vladislav Tretiak, the legendary Soviet goalie.</p>
        <p>"Martin reminds me of Tretiak; size, confidence and style," Fetisov said. "Quick feet, quick hands. He can give up an easy goal, then come back to make great saves. Tretiak was like that. He would make a big mistake, then stop everything after that."</p>
        <p>That's a hot goaltender. Almost as hot as Martin Brodeur and Dominik Hasek were last night.</p>
