        <p>When ANTHONY D. MARSHALL was a boy, it would have been hard to predict that he would someday write a book called "Zoo," a guide to 102 zoos and aquariums in the United States.</p>
        <p>"As a child I went to the Central Park Zoo, and after smelling the monkey house, I was more interested in the hot chocolate than in the animals," said Mr. Marshall, a former Ambassador to Madagascar, Kenya and Trinidad and Tobago.</p>
        <p>The book, which assesses the strengths and weaknesses of the various zoos, will be published next month by Random House. Mr. Marshall's mother, BROOKE ASTOR, and the Wildlife Conservation Society will give him a party on May 16 at -- where else? -- the Central Park Zoo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marshall spent three and a half years visiting zoos and aquariums, and it is his contention that they should be not only fun to visit but educational as well. He said this is the message they must impart: "Here are these animals. Some are from the wilds, and many face extinction, and we will tell you how to save them. We will help you save their habitat, for their habitat is ours, and if we don't do that, we are the endangered species.' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Marshall, 69, an investment adviser who sits on the boards Lincoln Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others, has a singular way of putting human beings in perspective. "People are only one of the 1,394,000 identified animal species," he said. "The question is 'Should we act like God and make all these decisions?' The answer? No, we should act like homo sapiens. We are just a superior ape."</p>
