        <p>China's space launching agency said today that a blast on April 2 that killed one person and injured 20 would not delay the launching of three foreign communications satellites this year.</p>
        <p>Officials said the explosion that rocked the Xichang Satellite Launching Center in southwestern China, damaging a major testing hall, would push back the national satellite program by at least three months.</p>
        <p>The loss of a $75 million weather satellite, the Fengyun-2, was regarded by space industry analysts as a serious blow to China's plans to develop a more sophisticated weather forecasting program this year.</p>
        <p>Chinese space agency officials disputed early reports that described the explosion as a "major setback" to its space program, which is competing with the United States and Europe for launching services. They said they believe they can meet the launch schedules of three foreign satellites set for July, August and December of this year. One Building Damaged</p>
        <p>All of them, the Apstar-1, the Optus-B3 and the Apstar-2, are communications satellites manufactured by Hughes Space and Communications Company for Hong Kong and Australian customers.</p>
        <p>A Western space industry analyst agreed with the Chinese assessment. "The explosion damaged one building, but they have other buildings to insure the scheduled launches," he said. "They hope within two to three months to make the building useable again."</p>
        <p>The Fengyun-2 satellite is a more advanced version of the Fengyun-1 model weather satellites launched in 1988 and 1990. The blast occurred after the satellite had received its on-board fueling to give it maneuvering ability once in orbit.</p>
        <p>Among the injured was a senior official of China's research institute for space technology, who inhaled toxic gases after the explosion, one Western analyst said. The technician who died had been receiving treatment for severe burns at a hospital.</p>
