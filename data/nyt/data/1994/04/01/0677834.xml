        <p>It may be as late as game time tomorrow night against the Devils before we find out the fate of the Rangers. Unless the National Hockey League's Owners' Assembly votes to allow the Rangers to trade Adam Graves and Brian Leetch for Wayne Gretzky, we might as well kiss the Cup goodbye.</p>
        <p>Call this the longest day. One can only imagine the promises and payoffs flying around like loose pucks. On one side is the so-called Ice-Agers, the traditional old guard of Canadian-oriented owners, led by Toronto and Montreal, who believe that a championship in New York will anchor the league against the rising tide of parvenu glitz-kriegers who want to turn it into a white N.B.A.</p>
        <p>On the other side is the so-called Seven Dwarfs, the progressive new franchises who want to make the N.H.L. a truly modern major league. The Dwarfs are led by the Disney Mighty Ducks and the Blockbuster Panthers. They are politicking for the votes of the so-called Snowblowers, who have so far stayed out of the fray -- like hockey players who spray ice when they brake sharply at the first sign of trouble.</p>
        <p>To permit this extraordinary trade after the league's regular deadline requires a two-thirds vote by the Assembly, a semisecret group that meets only in special session and then only on issues that affect the survival of the sport.</p>
        <p>The Ice-Agers have been driven by what they see as disturbing trends throughout sport, most notably the rise of verbal and physical violence in the N.B.A., which they feel cheapens fighting. As more and more basketball players become valued for "mean streaks," long an ice hockey virtue, the specialness of male skaters begins to melt.</p>
        <p>The media frenzy over Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan was disturbing, too, for several reasons. It stole attention from Olympic hockey, long an N.H.L. warm-up attraction, and it "feminized" the working-class "grit" long prized from Canadian Junior hockey on up. Also, the coming World Cup, while it has yet to grip the American imagination, could be a serious rival for the sports consumer dollar, especially if it leaves a viable pro league in this country.</p>
        <p>These concerns were expressed to the Rangers' president and general manager, Neil Smith. Allegedly, the messenger also said: "Build it and he will come."</p>
        <p>Smith assumed that if he created the right team, Gretzy would be delivered to him. Smith knew he would be drawing to an inside straight, a fool's gamble, but the payoff could be enormous.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has been paying attention this season has watched the play unfold with inexorable precision. Instead of creating a dazzling young team of the future around Graves, Leetch, Tony Amonte and assorted Sergeis, Smith and Coach Mike Keenan went for the short term. Instead of crafting for finesse, they packed for "grit" and "mean streaks." They went for durability and experience instead of unpredictable possibility. They built a wall to protect The Great Gretzky.</p>
        <p>In trading off Amonte and Mike Gartner, they purged the team of the two players closest to Gretzky in style. Young Amonte and old Gartner are shooters, their skills almost delicate in execution. While neither are Snowblowers or players who require protection, they are nobody's muscle, either; they could not be expected to sacrifice their bodies for Gretzky.</p>
        <p>Trading Graves and Leetch is the price to pay for the Cup. They are clearly the future of the Rangers, Graves a budding superstar with one of the sunniest personalities in sport, and Leetch a brilliant player slowly finding his great reach. It would have been a pleasure to watch them bloom. It would be too much to ask to watch them bloom in a Garden with Gretzky and Messier.</p>
        <p>Messier, of course, as we have known since he first came to the Rangers in 1991, is the true handle on the Cup. As the Ice-Agers were aware, Gretzky has never won a Cup without Messier, while Messier has won without Gretzky. All such championships happened to the Edmonton Oilers, a team that Smith and Keenan have been trying to resurrect in New York; resurrect is a good word since many of the Oiler players now on the Rangers are not exactly in the flush of youth.</p>
        <p>Flush, inside straight, the deck has its jokers, too.</p>
        <p>What if an enraged media, alerted by this column's exclusive information, charge the Owners' Assembly with attempted "fixing" and scare it off?</p>
        <p>What if the Ducks are able to nibble away enough of the two-thirds vote to block the trade?</p>
        <p>What if the Rangers' new ownership, with its own connections within the entertainment world, decides to align with the Seven Dwarfs?</p>
        <p>What if the Ice-Agers come to their senses and see a future in which it might replace the N.B.A. (Ice Graves! Be Like Sergei!)?</p>
        <p>There is only one sure thing.</p>
        <p>If Gretzky plays against the Devils tomorrow night, the Rangers will win the Stanley Cup. If he doesn't and they don't, I may move back to New Jersey. After all, there is only one kind of fool greater than a Ranger fool.</p>
