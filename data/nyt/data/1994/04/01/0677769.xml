        <p>Justice Department officials yesterday announced a settlement with the company that administers the S.A.T. to give disabled students an extra chance to take the revised test this school year.</p>
        <p>The settlement, which gives disabled students two additional test dates, came just weeks after the Clinton Administration began an investigation into whether the New Jersey-based Educational Testing Service and the College Entrance Examination Board, which owns the test, were in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act.</p>

        <p>Justice Department officials yesterday announced a settlement with the company that administers the S.A.T. to give disabled students an extra chance to take the revised test this school year.</p>
        <p>The settlement, which gives disabled students two additional test dates, came just weeks after the Clinton Administration began an investigation into whether the New Jersey-based Educational Testing Service and the College Entrance Examination Board, which owns the test, were in violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act.</p>
        <p>Disabled students who require extra time or help were given the new test when it was introduced in mid-March. But creating what one official described as an unfair advantage, other students had the option to take the revised Scholastic Assessment Test on May 7 or June 4 as well.</p>
        <p>Now, even those disabled students who took the March test can cancel their scores and try again on June 4 or June 8, free of charge. 1.8 Million Students a Year</p>
        <p>"The agreement will open up what is an American rite of passage" for disabled students, said John L. Wodatch, a Justice Department lawyer, at a news conference late yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The S.A.T., which measures mathematical and verbal skills, is given to 1.8 million high school students every year. Most American colleges and universities require students to submit their S.A.T. scores as part of their application, and then they use them to help decide whom to admit.</p>
        <p>But earlier this month, the testing service began giving a revised S.A.T., an exam that has been developed over the last three years and is designed to place greater emphasis on reading comprehension than the traditional S.A.T. The new test also reduces the number of multiple choice questions on the math portion and for the first time allows students to use calculators to help solve mathematics problems.</p>
        <p>Under E.T.S.'s original plan, students with disabilities who require extra time or special accommodations, like readers or large type, could have taken the new test either on March 19 or March 23, or take the old tests at later dates.  Felt Plan Was Fair</p>
        <p>Stanford von Mayrhauser, general counsel for E.T.S., said yesterday that while accepting the settlement, the company had felt its initial plan was fair and did not violate the law. The staggered dates, he said, were part of College Board's and E.T.S.'s effort to "phase in" the new test, called S.A.T.-I, in a way that insured the new and old tests were comparable.</p>
        <p>"We strongly believe that our plans for introducing the S.A.T.-I were fair and reasonable and lawful," he said. But "given the cost of litigation and feedback from parents" who said they did not realize March was the only test date for disabled students, they decided to reach an out-of-court settlement, he said. About 2,500 disabled students are expected to take the test in June. Some 20,000 disabled students take it each year.</p>
        <p>At the news conference yesterday, Mr. Wodatch of the Justice Department said that in mid-February, the civil rights division began receiving complaints from more than 50 families with disabled students, saying that their children had not been alerted about the March date in time to prepare for the exam. E.T.S. officials said they had published the test dates in September and sent notices to schools in January.  A Class Action Suit</p>
        <p>Last month, lawyers for a Westchester County student with a mild form of cerebral palsy filed a class action suit in Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York contending that both the testing company and the College Board were violating Federal law.</p>
        <p>They said that while E.T.S. officials said the scoring on both the S.A.T.-I and the old exam were comparable, they had no assurances that college admissions officers would treat the results from the two tests the same way.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed in the name of Jaclyn Okin, a junior at a Westchester County school, as the representative of the class of disabled students who contend that their rights under the disabilities act were violated. Because of her disability, Ms. Okin cannot read as fast as many other students and requires extra time to complete written examinations.</p>
