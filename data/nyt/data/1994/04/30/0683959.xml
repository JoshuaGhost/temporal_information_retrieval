        <p>The Knicks opened the playoffs with a victory last night, and Charles Smith won over some critics in the process.</p>
        <p>Scoring 11 of his 17 points in the decisive fourth quarter, Smith helped lift the Knicks to a 91-80 victory over the Nets in Game 1 of their three-of-five-game playoff series at Madison Square Garden. After a regular season in which he was booed by home fans and hampered by a sore left knee that required arthroscopic surgery, Smith vowed that the playoffs would be different. In this game, he delivered.</p>
        <p>This was the Smith the Knicks have been waiting for. He made strong low-post moves. He took advantage of his 6-foot-10-inch frame, powering to the basket. And he kept the Nets off balance with a mixture of jumpers, post-up moves and drives that pushed the Knicks ahead and kept them there.</p>
        <p>The only sound Smith heard from the crowd was cheering. And if he continues to produce, he will be a key factor in New York's playoff drive.</p>
        <p>"I felt a sense of urgency," said Smith of his fourth-quarter surge. "You don't want to be in a 2-point game with a couple of minutes to go with the Nets because they have a lot of scorers and a lot of people who can get the job done. Tonight, we were all more psyched because it was the playoffs.</p>
        <p>"I wasn't concerned about the crowd getting behind me, or if they weren't behind me. I have to come to play. That's in the past. I'm not thinking about that. We have to win ball games. If I'm going to worry about what the crowd thinks, I'm going to be in trouble."</p>
        <p>But in this game, it was the Nets who were in trouble. The Knicks played with playoff-like emotion and intensity, holding the Nets to a franchise-low point total for the playoffs. And the most frustrated Nets player was Kenny Anderson, the All-Star point guard who tormented New York during the regular season.</p>
        <p>Anderson was held to 13 points and 6 assists, shooting just 3 for 11 from the field. During their three-day pre-playoff camp in Charleston, S.C., the Knicks spent most of their time working on defending the Nets' pick-and-roll, Anderson's favorite play. It was time well spent.</p>
        <p>Anderson was harassed all game by New York's point guard team of Derek Harper and Greg Anthony. And whenever Anderson got past them, New York's inside players quickly stepped over to clog the middle. Often, Anderson found himself surrounded in the lane with nowhere to go.</p>
        <p>"They played tough D on us all night, especially at end," Anderson said. "We have to go back, look at the film and make some adjustments."</p>
        <p>Having defeated the Knicks in four out of five regular-season games, the Nets entered the game with confidence, while New York entered it with questions to answer. The Knicks answered the challenge. A Decisive Run</p>
        <p>With the Nets leading, 68-64, the Knicks went on a decisive 10-0 run to take the lead for good. Patrick Ewing spun past Derrick Coleman on the baseline, then made a layup as Coleman committed a foul. Ewing, who scored 25 points and grabbed 13 rebounds, added the foul shot to bring New York within 1. Then after Chris Morris missed a 3-point jumper from the corner, Smith gave New York the lead, making a strong layup while being fouled by Morris. Smith missed the foul shot, but Ewing came soaring into the lane and slam-dunked the rebound, giving the Knicks a 71-68 edge.</p>
        <p>On New Jersey's next possession, John Starks drew a charging foul against Johnny Newman. Starks fell hard to the floor, bruising his lower back, and was forced to leave the game.</p>
        <p>"I'll be O.K. for Sunday," said Starks after the game, although he was still in pain.</p>
        <p>But the Knicks kept rolling. Double-teamed, Ewing passed to Anthony, who made a 3-point jumper from behind the key to give New York a 74-68 lead. The Nets never got closer than 5 points from there. Big Plays</p>
        <p>"Charles Smith stepped up and made some big, big plays," said Knicks Coach Pat Riley as he looked ahead to Game 2 tomorrow. "He can play the game of basketball. It's only one game. I'm happy for him tonight. I don't want him to live on this game the rest of the playoffs. He knows he can accomplish those things when he's playing freely and unencumbered."</p>
        <p>Coleman led the Nets with 27 points and 10 rebounds.</p>
        <p>"We wanted to send a message to them," said Anthony Bonner. "They predicted a win but we're just trying to tell them that even though there are two teams in this area we are the team."</p>
        <p>The fourth quarter began with the Knicks clinging to a 63-61 lead. The Nets could have lost momentum when Coleman went to the locker room with a bleeding mouth at the 3:38 mark of the third quarter. At that point, the Knicks led, 54-51. But the Nets continued to play well without their star forward. Morris provided a spark of the bench, making two spectacular follow-up dunks off missed shots. Coleman took four stitches to close his upper lip, and he returned early in the fourth quarter. But his return was not enough to lift the Nets. Straight Out of the 1950's</p>
        <p>The most surprising part of the first 24 minutes was the score: Knicks 35, Nets 33. The 68 points between the two teams set a National Basketball Association playoff record for fewest points in a half since the inception of the 24-second clock in the 1954-55 season.</p>
        <p>Nothing came easy on offense. Both teams were well-prepared defensively, but almost every player looked nervous. Two of the game's primary offensive stars, Ewing and Anderson, had rough starts. Ewing had 11 first-half points, but he was just 4 of 14 from the field at intermission. The Nets did a good job of double-teaming Ewing whenever he put the ball on the floor, forcing him to make awkward moves to the basket. Ewing tried to counter with his jumper, but his touch was off. REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Knicks won a blind draw conducted by the National Basketball Association for the 24th pick in the June draft. The Atlanta Hawks and the Knicks finished with the same record (57-25), forcing the need for a draw. The Knicks also have the 26th pick, acquired in a trade with the Hawks, via the Houston Rockets.
