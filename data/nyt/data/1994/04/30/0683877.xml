        <p>Rounding out a spate of positive financial news from the nation's auto industry, the Ford Motor Company today reported its best quarterly results since 1989, posting a first-quarter profit of $904 million, or $1.66 a share. That sum, up 58 percent from a year earlier, reflected an extraordinary charge against earnings of $440 million from the sale of First Nationwide Bank, a savings and loan.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Ford reported a first-quarter profit of $572 million, or $1.02 a share. On Thursday, the General Motors Corporation posted a first-quarter profit of $853.7 million, or 81 cents a share, a 66 percent gain from a year earlier. Last week, the Chrysler Corporation reported a record quarterly profit of $938 million, up 77 percent from a year earlier. Big Gains in U.S.</p>
        <p>Like the gains at Chrysler and G.M., Ford's improved results stemmed largely from higher United States automotive sales. Ford also gained from a better performance overseas as well as from its financial services group, absent the First Nationwide write-off. On April 14, Ford agreed to sell First Nationwide to First Madison Bank for $1.1 billion.</p>

        <p>Rounding out a spate of positive financial news from the nation's auto industry, the Ford Motor Company today reported its best quarterly results since 1989, posting a first-quarter profit of $904 million, or $1.66 a share. That sum, up 58 percent from a year earlier, reflected an extraordinary charge against earnings of $440 million from the sale of First Nationwide Bank, a savings and loan.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Ford reported a first-quarter profit of $572 million, or $1.02 a share. On Thursday, the General Motors Corporation posted a first-quarter profit of $853.7 million, or 81 cents a share, a 66 percent gain from a year earlier. Last week, the Chrysler Corporation reported a record quarterly profit of $938 million, up 77 percent from a year earlier. Big Gains in U.S.</p>
        <p>Like the gains at Chrysler and G.M., Ford's improved results stemmed largely from higher United States automotive sales. Ford also gained from a better performance overseas as well as from its financial services group, absent the First Nationwide write-off. On April 14, Ford agreed to sell First Nationwide to First Madison Bank for $1.1 billion.</p>
        <p>Net income from worldwide automotive operations was $955 million, compared with $176 million a year earlier. Automotive operations in the United States accounted for $835 million of the profit, compared with $113 million a year earlier. Excluding the write-off, financial services earned $389 million, down from $396 million. Ford's total revenue for the quarter was $30.4 billion, up 13.6 percent from $26.8 billion a year ago.</p>
        <p>Ford said the latest good financial news should be just the beginning, since automotive sales are expected to grow even stronger. "If you think of this in baseball terminology, the recovery is in the first inning in Europe and the third or fourth inning in the United States," said David N. McCammon, vice president-finance and treasurer.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCammon said Ford expected sales of cars and light trucks in the United States to surpass the previous record of 16.3 million vehicles, putting Ford's forecast in line with those of many economists who believe sales will not peak until late 1995 or 1996. Despite positive earning news, investor concerns about the duration and robustness of the upswing in automotive sales have knocked Big Three stocks off their recent highs. Ford shares closed at $58.375 a share yesterday, up 87.5 cents, in active trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Harvey Heinbach, automotive stock analyst for Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, said his firm expected sales of 16.8 million vehicles in 1996. "If we're right, these stocks will bounce back," he said. One risk, however, is nervous institutional investors who do not want to be caught giving back gains won over the last two years and are, therefore, inclined to sell the stocks. "The last thing they want," Mr. Heinbach said, "is a round trip."</p>
        <p>David Healy, auto analyst for S. G. Warburg &amp; Company, called Ford's report "a clean, good quarter." But, he said, shares of Ford and other auto companies "will have trouble as long as interest rates are going up."</p>
        <p>8% Rise in Output</p>
        <p>Mr. McCammon said supplies of Ford's most popular models -- the Explorer sport utility vehicle, Mustang sport coupe and Windstar mini-van -- were tight, but "the rest of the stocks are in good shape." The auto maker is scheduling an 8 percent increase in North American production in the second quarter, which means more overtime, faster assembly line speeds and full production at Ford's Oakville, Ontario, assembly plant, where production of the Windstar van is replacing compact-car output.</p>
        <p>In the first quarter, Ford factories in North America ran at 110 percent of straight-time capacity; absolute maximum capacity is about 125 percent of straight time, or two eight-hour shifts a day.</p>
        <p>Prices of cars and trucks have firmed, as evidenced by the smaller rebates that Ford paid to stimulate retail sales. The average rebate was $565 in the quarter, down from $720 a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Ford estimated that its pretax profit on vehicles sold in the United States was $1,400 a unit, compared with about $2,000 for Chrysler and $800 for G.M. Mr. McCammon said the main reason for Chrysler's superior profitability was its model mix, which is skewed toward light trucks: mini-vans, sport utilities and pickups. Accordingly, Ford is raising the percentage of its production that consists of light trucks to 52 percent, from less than half.  COMPANY REPORTS</p>
