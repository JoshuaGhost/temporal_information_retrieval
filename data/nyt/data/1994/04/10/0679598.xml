        <p>For more than 22 years, Martha Sedgwick, a painter, and her husband, Cris Cristofaro, a sculptor, lived and worked peacefully in a loft building at 156 West 22d Street.</p>
        <p>Then, they say, the brothel tried to move in.</p>
        <p>The first sign came in early March, they say. That's when a new tenant began dividing a loft upstairs into wooden cubicles. Catching the drift, Mr. Cristofaro says, he asked the tenant, an elegantly dressed man in his 30's who arrived in a Mercedes, what was going on.</p>
        <p>The man said he was building a dance studio. When Mr. Cristofaro expressed skepticism, the tenant, identifying himself as Joseph Mitchell, told him there was nothing he could do about it except move.</p>
        <p>Then began, Mr. Cristofaro and Ms. Sedgwick say, a series of threatening phone calls and 10 bogus calls to 911 that brought the police and fire departments to the building expecting to find fire, explosives, robberies, a man with a gun and, once, two bodies on the second floor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sedgwick called it "scary beyond belief."</p>
        <p>After the artists notified Councilman Thomas K. Duane, building inspectors found that Mr. Mitchell did not have a permit for the loft work, and a stop-work order was issued. On March 30, Mr. Mitchell was arrested for violating a second stop-work order. A small amount of cocaine was in his possession, said William H. Daly, head of the Mayor's Office of Midtown Enforcement. His date in Criminal Court is set for April 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daly said Mr. Mitchell had been investigated for links to other massage parlors in midtown. The bogus and threatening calls, he said, follow a pattern of intimidation when complaints are made against massage parlors. Attempts to reach Mr. Mitchell were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mitchell agreed last Monday to give up the lease for the return of $3,300 rent and security, said the landlord, Peter Winston, of Bernest Realty. He said Mr. Mitchell also asked to retrieve items from the loft, "without the tenants calling the police." Mr. Cristofaro and Ms. Sedgwick are willing to oblige. "I just hope and pray the harassment will end," Mr. Cristofaro said. M.H.  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: CLINTON</p>
