        <p>Last week a plane crash killing two African presidents touched off bloody clashes between tribal factions in the Rwandan capital of Kigali. Estimates from observers in the capital put the death toll in the thousands.</p>
        <p>The crisis began Wednesday when the plane carrying the Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, two tiny countries in central Africa, was shot down at the Kigali airport by unidentified attackers. The two leaders had been attending peace talks in Tanzania.</p>
        <p>The death of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana, a 57-year-old former army officer who had led his country for almost 20 years, ignited brutal street fighting and threatened efforts to end decades of civil war between its minority Tutsi tribe and the majority Hutu. Most of the killing has been attributed to the Presidential Guard, which is loyal to the slain leader.</p>
        <p>Several prominent Hutu politicians were reported slain along with opposition figures, civilians and at least 10 peacekeeping soldiers.</p>
        <p>In neighboring Burundi, which has also been plagued by warfare between Tutsi and Hutu factions, the death of 39-year-old President Cyprien Ntaryamira, its second Hutu leader, sparked no bloodshed.</p>
        <p>The United States, Belgium and France were mobilizing Saturday to evacuate their citizens, as caravans of foreigners were moving away from the capital, trying to reach Burundi or neighboring Zaire. PAUL LEWIS</p>
