        <p>The candidate of the right, Armando Calderon Sol, won a landslide vote today in a presidential runoff election, unofficial returns indicated. His victory further consolidated the power that the governing party won last month in local and parlimentary elections.</p>

        <p>The candidate of the right, Armando Calderon Sol, won a landslide vote today in a presidential runoff election, unofficial returns indicated. His victory further consolidated the power that the governing party won last month in local and parlimentary elections.</p>
        <p>Returns from about 35 percent of the precincts showed Mr. Calderon Sol had 66 percent of the vote, and Ruben Zamora, the candidate of the left, had about 33 percent. Late this evening Mr. Zamora appeared on television to concede.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Calderon Sol's victory comes in a still delicate political climate, with the suspicions and hatreds of a 12-year civil war hanging over the voting. Leaders of the former leftist guerrillas, who just two years ago gave up their weapons in return for promises they could participate in free elections, vehemently alleged that the right's triumph had been enhanced by electoral fraud. Leftist Feel Cheated</p>
        <p>Voting irregularities and bitterness on the part of the leftists threaten to undermine the election's goal of bringing to office a government of reconciliation.</p>
        <p>A senior United Nations official here said, "Before the voting there was widespread mistrust of electoral system; now there is even more."</p>
        <p>In an often disorderly first electoral round among seven candidates last month, Mr. Calderon Sol, 45, won nearly double the vote of Mr. Zamora, his closest competitor.</p>
        <p>Voters today found more orderly polling places than last month.</p>
        <p>Jose Luis Larios, 64, who owns a one-chair barber shop, said that last month he had spent three hours in line, only to find his name had disappeared from the voting list. "This time the wait was short, and my name was back," he said. "But a lot of my customers are saying they don't trust the results from last month, or this time either." Suspicions Widespread</p>
        <p>Mr. Larios's customers reflect a widely held view that the elections, a pivotal step from civil war to democracy, were flawed.</p>
        <p>Shortly after last month's election, United Nations observers declared the results acceptable, but now they say that assessment was generous.</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that their candidate, Mr. Zamora, would have probably lost under any conditions, leftist leaders said they were cheated of enough local and legislative offices that the balance of power has been thrown unfairly to the right.</p>
        <p>Many leaders of the former guerrillas threatened to hobble Mr. Calderon Sol's Government if it does not grant the left more political influence than represented by the offices it won. They suggest that they could stall the legislature, where the leftist coalition won 22 of 84 seats, or employ more aggressive tactics like strikes and civil disobedience.</p>
        <p>Schafik Handal, general coordinator of the largest group on the left, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, said, "They got away with it at the polls, but we will not let them unilaterally impose their right-wing policies on the country." Conciliatory Words</p>
        <p>For its part, Mr. Calderon Sol's party, the Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, agrees that voting difficulties have weakened faith in elections. Party officials, however, say these difficulties did not favor their candidates.</p>
        <p>Throughout the campaign, Mr. Calderon Sol, a popular two-term mayor of San Salvador, promised he would work to prevent the sort of mistrust the vote seem to have encouraged.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calderon Sol also says he has moderated his views since 1981, when he helped found the Arena party. Many of the Arena leaders in those days, according to United States officials, were organizing or financing death squads; Arena leaders have always denied the allegations.</p>
