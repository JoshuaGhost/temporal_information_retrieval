        <p>He has become one of New York's most recognizable athletes. He is easy to pick out in the crowd at a Knick game, in commercials for athletic apparel and on the ice anywhere. Maybe it's the set jaw, the 5 o'clock shadow or the intimidating stare. Maybe it's his aura that draws all the attention.</p>
        <p>But Mark Messier, team captain and center for the Rangers, has set a standard in the National Hockey League with a celebrated career and five Stanley Cup rings. And he maintained that excellence today with two goals as the Rangers eliminated the Islanders in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
        <p>The first goal, at 10 minutes 22 seconds of the second period, was a shot from the left circle that put the Rangers ahead, 3-2. Messier stole the puck inside the Islander blue line and then put the puck between Ron Hextall's pads.</p>
        <p>"He didn't give me much to shoot at, but it just found its way through." Messier said.</p>
        <p>His second goal, a breakaway with three minutes to go, put the Rangers up, 5-2, and secured the victory. What Slump?</p>
        <p>There was a time, from mid-February to mid-April, when Messier went 23 games without a goal. He has apparently gotten over that slump. Interestingly, it was against the Islanders that he got back on track, scoring two goals in a 5-4 loss to the Islanders in the final game of the regular season.</p>
        <p>But whether he scores or not, it is clear what Messier means to the Rangers.</p>
        <p>"His leadership," said his linemate, Adam Graves. "He wouldn't have to score a goal all year long and he would still probably be the m.v.p. of this team. He's a great playmaker and sets up plays for us, kills penalties, everything. He just raises his play at the key time."</p>
        <p>Messier scored four goals in the four playoff games against the Islanders and added three assists. He is the nucleus of a team that was too strong for the Islanders all over the ice. He is in third place on the N.H.L.'s career playoff goal-scoring list with 91 goals, second in assists and second in scoring with 235 points. Captain Expects No Letdown</p>
        <p>The Rangers will now have a week off until the second round begins, but Messier is not afraid of a letdown. At 33 years of age, he welcomes it.</p>
        <p>"At this point in the year it is critical, vital," Messier. "The experience we have in the locker room, the guys will know how to use it to our advantage."</p>
        <p>He may as well single himself out here. Messier is the kind of player who will remind the Rangers what they were doing at this time a year ago -- which is watching the playoffs on television. He will motivate with his play, even in practice, when he chases down another forward and acts like a tough defenseman.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Rangers might not really have a week off, not with Messier on the club.</p>
        <p>"We can enjoy the victory for sure," Messier said. "But there's not more elation in the locker room because we did it in four games. It's a first step. We know what our goal is, and we're not going to get ahead of ourselves."</p>
        <p>You learn a lot in 15 years of playing in the N.H.L. Messier sounded as if he were making sure to say the the right thing, the safe thing. But he means what he says.</p>
        <p>"We're not going to play flawless hockey -- we're going to try to," Messier said. "But the thing is when we did get down, we kept our composure.</p>
        <p>"I just think we carried a lot of momentum from the regular season into this series. We won a huge game in New Jersey, and the rest of the regular-season games we didn't have to play for much. Still, we went out and played hard, and it showed in this series.</p>
        <p>"But it wasn't easy. I've never played in a series that was easy, believe me."  HOCKEY</p>
