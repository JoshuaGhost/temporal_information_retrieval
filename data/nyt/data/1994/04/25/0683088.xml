        <p>The afternoon lesson plan in Studio 563 of the Drama Division of the Juilliard School was a parody of that stirring anthem from the musical "Les Miserables," the song "Do You Hear the People Sing?"</p>
        <p>This time the lyrics said:</p>
        <p>Do you hear the students sing?</p>
        <p>As they embrace their daily fate,</p>
        <p>Facing a whipping and a beating</p>
        <p>If they don't enunciate --</p>
        <p>The words are to be belted out by a star-filled cast at the Drama Division's 25th anniversary benefit today in the Juilliard Theater.</p>
        <p>Gathering around the rehearsal hall piano the other afternoon were the creators of an hourlong revue, the highlight of the festivities, including the playwrights WENDY WASSERSTEIN and CHRISTOPHER DURANG ; the choreographer CHRISTOPHER CHADMAN ; the director GERALD A. GUTIERREZ and the musical director TOM FAY .</p>
        <p>The 30 stars of the show, to be drawn from the school's 548 alumni through the years, include KEVIN KLINE and PATTI LUPONE , both members of Juilliard's first drama class, which graduated in 1972, and KELLY McGILLIS , KEVIN SPACEY , BOYD GAINES , DIANE VENORA and MICHAEL HAYDEN , who is starring in "Carousel."</p>
        <p>The benefit will help subsidize the scholarship fund at the school, which has an enrollment of 75 and charges $20,000 a year for room and board.  There are nearly 800 applicants for the 25 freshman slots annually.</p>
        <p>"We try to offer the best of American training, which is rooted in emotional reality and understanding," said the school's director, Michael Kahn, "and the best of European training, which has paid attention to the technical ability of actors, and has focused on the text."
