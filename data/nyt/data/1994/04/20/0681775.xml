        <p>P. D. Ouspensky, a crusty Russian philosopher who allied himself for a time with the mystic G. I. Gurdjieff but died awash in frustration and alcohol in 1947, may seem an odd prophet for the New Age. Yet he is evidently so regarded: even his profoundly pessimistic novel, "Strange Life of Ivan Osokin," begun before he met Gurdjieff in 1915 and long available from Penguin on its literary merits, has migrated to Penguin's New Age line, Arkana.</p>
        <p>So it is no surprise to find the tale fitted out with kicky music by Peter Gordon and a jaunty libretto by Constance Congdon in the opera "The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin," at La Mama.</p>

        <p>P. D. Ouspensky, a crusty Russian philosopher who allied himself for a time with the mystic G. I. Gurdjieff but died awash in frustration and alcohol in 1947, may seem an odd prophet for the New Age. Yet he is evidently so regarded: even his profoundly pessimistic novel, "Strange Life of Ivan Osokin," begun before he met Gurdjieff in 1915 and long available from Penguin on its literary merits, has migrated to Penguin's New Age line, Arkana.</p>
        <p>So it is no surprise to find the tale fitted out with kicky music by Peter Gordon and a jaunty libretto by Constance Congdon in the opera "The Strange Life of Ivan Osokin," at La Mama.</p>
        <p>Osokin, in Ouspensky's autobiographical conception, is a wastrel in his mid-20's. Magically allowed to relive his last dozen years and convinced he will do better, he of course does nothing of the sort. However different or merely confused his motives may seem, his actions emerge precisely the same, in line with Ouspensky's notion of eternal recurrence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon and Ms. Congdon's opera, conceived and directed by Lawrence Sacharow for River Arts Repertory and Arts at St. Ann's, captures the externals of this psychological drama well. And it is oddly attractive even when it swathes the novel's gloomy panic in a toothless kind of go-with-the-flow resignation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon's score, based in a fusion of jazz and Minimalism, achieves great variety, subtlety and depth for all its economy. Mr. Sacharow's direction, with scenery by Marjorie Bradley Kellogg, costumes by Constance Hoffman and lighting by Michael Chybowski, made for a fast-paced evening on Saturday but for some indulgence in a gambling scene.</p>
        <p>The cast was filled with fine voices of a theatrical if not an operatic sort, although Tamara Walker, as Osokin's beloved Zinaida, chirped out an unexpected bit of coloratura beautifully. Jeff Reynolds made a tour de force of the title role, which found him onstage for most of three hours. April Armstrong, Lynnen Yakes, Hugo Munday and Wilbur Pauley all had impressive moments.</p>
        <p>Performances run nightly through Sunday at La Mama E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village.</p>
