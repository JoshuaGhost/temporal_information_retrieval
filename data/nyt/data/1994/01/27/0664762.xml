        <p>In a report scheduled to be released today, the Securities and Exchange Commission is recommending that the minimum quote on stock prices be cut in half, to 6.25 cents from 12.5 cents, officials familiar with the details of the report said yesterday.</p>

        <p>In a report scheduled to be released today, the Securities and Exchange Commission is recommending that the minimum quote on stock prices be cut in half, to 6.25 cents from 12.5 cents, officials familiar with the details of the report said yesterday.</p>
        <p>If adopted, the change would threaten to slice broker profit margins in at least some securities and could provide a break to investors buying and selling those securities.</p>
        <p>Currently, when specialists at the New York or American stock exchanges or market makers in the Nasdaq system are making markets in stocks trading for more than a few dollars a share, the minimum price spread between the bid and asked price is 12.5 cents, or 1/8 of a point. That difference represents the broker's profit margin.</p>
        <p>Under current market practice, maintaining that spread also prevents competing brokers who want to capture market share by offering a narrower spread from doing so.  Number of Recommendations</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. recommendation is one of a number made in Market 2000, a two-year study that is the agency's first long look at the equity markets in more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>S.E.C. officials spent yesterday briefing Congressional committees and the exchanges about the report's contents, the officials said.</p>
        <p>While the report does not contain the sort of sweeping recommendations that an independent commission of industry leaders and experts proposed in the early 1970's, the new study is sure to raise hackles within the securities industry, the officials said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The earlier study led to sweeping changes for the markets in 1975, when Congress did away with broker-dealers' fixed commissions.</p>
        <p>The contents of Market 2000 contain nothing so earth-shattering, the officials said, largely because regulators feel that both the equity markets and the regulatory structure are functioning quite well over all.</p>
        <p>The pricing recommendation is one of about 16 proposed changes, the officials said. The proposals are clustered in a number of areas, including ways to improve trading and quote information available to brokers, increasing fair competition and improving open market access.</p>
        <p>Specific recommendations also include improving disclosure of so-called soft dollar practices by brokers, where commissions are used to pay for activities other than trading, like research.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. would also like to see a change in a New York Stock Exchange rule that restricts member firms from trading a number of stocks, many of America's leading companies among them, away from the exchange.  Nasdaq Approves Plan</p>
        <p>The report also calls for improvements in reporting of any trades done abroad, and recommends that access to Selectnet, Nasdaq's computerized trading system, be broadened.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. did not have to wait long to see the latter recommendation acted upon.</p>
        <p>Nasdaq said yesterday that its board of governors had approved giving access to Selectnet to non-Nasdaq members.</p>
