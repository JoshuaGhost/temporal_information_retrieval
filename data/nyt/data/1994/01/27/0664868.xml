        <p>Holly Cole  Pop Singer Fez at the Time Cafe</p>
        <p>With her clear, bright voice, eclectic taste that runs from country to jazz, and an approach to a song that is often brashly ironic, Holly Cole is a pop-jazz singer with a distinctly contemporary point of view.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cole, who appeared with her trio on Tuesday and Wednesday, is a big star in Canada but only a cult figure in the United States, where she has released two albums. All it would take to establish her here is one medium-size hit.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday evening, Ms. Cole and her musical partners, Aaron Davis on piano and David Piltch on bass, gave a concert that was by turns funny, elegant, bawdy and touching. Although Ms. Cole and her colleagues call themselves a trio, they lean more toward pop than toward jazz. Ms. Cole, who suggests a vocal hybrid of Bette Midler and Phoebe Snow, rarely improvises. Her strong, declarative approach is more concerned with interpreting lyrics than with rhythmic subtlety.</p>
        <p>Clad in an evening dress and long black gloves, Ms. Cole affected a funky elegance that was mirrored in her choice of material and in her smart stage patter. A sassy, uptempo version of "On a Slow Boat to China" was introduced as a song about "unadulterated lust on the ocean." "Everything I Have" was dedicated to "our old friends the Bobbitts." The vintage Doris Day hit "Que Sera, Sera" was transformed from an expression of girlish optimism into a bluesy song of ironic resignation.</p>
        <p>Deeply suspicious of pop's romantic platitudes, Ms. Cole introduced "If I Were a Bell" as the only song in her arsenal with "a real-life Hollywood ending," then delivered guttural Louis Armstrong-style "ding-dongs" that undercut its giddiness with a raw, comic sensuality.
