        <p>Kalanchoe Flowers</p>
        <p>Q.  Please tell me how I can get my kalanchoe to bloom as profusely as when I bought it. Other than not flowering, it's quite healthy. -- H. Bonterre, Bronx</p>
        <p>A.  This popular house plant, with its billowy winter blooms, is a member of the stonecrop family. Most of the 200 species come from Africa or Madagascar. Kalanchoe blossfeldi ana, a holiday favorite, includes some brightly flowered hybrids with names like Tom Thumb, Compacta and Yellow Darling.</p>
        <p>Like the poinsettia, the kalanchoes are short-day plants, meaning that they can be cajoled into blooming only if they are given a special dark treatment. Some professional growers do this by manipulating the amount of light they receive for as long as three months; the plants are kept in total darkness for as long as 16 hours a day. But at least one house plant owner I know succeeded in initiating flower buds by limiting his plant's light to nine hours daily during September.</p>
        <p>The best light control is achieved by tucking the plant into a closet in the evening and not opening the door again. Just don't forget to take it out in the morning. When buds appear, this nightly ritual can be stopped.</p>
        <p>Since the kalanchoes are succulents, they need a porous, somewhat sandy soil that drains well, with an application of a diluted liquid fertilizer twice a month through late summer and fall. In winter, they prefer cool nights, with temperatures as low as 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Let There Be Shade</p>
        <p>Q.  I recently moved to an apartment with no direct sunlight and little diffuse light. Are there plants that will thrive here? -- B. J. Schonfeld, Brooklyn</p>
        <p>A.  There's no need to despair, said Elvin McDonald, whose recently published book, "The New House Plant" (Macmillan, $40), lists plants that brighten rooms with no direct sun. His suggestions include the peace lily (Spathiphyllum), which has elongated leaves with short stems and actually flowers better without sun, and its cousin the Chinese evergreen (Aglaonema), which has waxy leaves and silver markings.</p>
        <p>Shade is also preferred for the trailing and climbing philodendrons, with their heart-shaped leaves; pothos, also called Devil's Ivy (Scindapsus), which has creamy or white variegated leaves; snake plant (Sansevieria); cast-iron plant (Aspidistra); gasteria, and many ferns, including Boston fern and rabbit's foot fern.</p>
        <p>Good grooming -- which means keeping the leaves dust-free -- is especially important for plants growing in low light, and fertilizer should be applied only sparingly.</p>
