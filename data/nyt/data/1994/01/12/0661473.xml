        <p>The Irish Government said today that it would rescind the 20-year-old regulation that has prevented representatives of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, from speaking on television and radio.</p>
        <p>The removal of the ban as of Jan. 19 was widely interpreted here and in the British province of Northern Ireland as a concession intended to persuade Sinn Fein to renounce the I.R.A. campaign of violence and to accept the offer of the British and Irish Governments to join talks to end the guerrilla war that has killed 3,112 people since 1969.</p>

        <p>The Irish Government said today that it would rescind the 20-year-old regulation that has prevented representatives of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, from speaking on television and radio.</p>
        <p>The removal of the ban as of Jan. 19 was widely interpreted here and in the British province of Northern Ireland as a concession intended to persuade Sinn Fein to renounce the I.R.A. campaign of violence and to accept the offer of the British and Irish Governments to join talks to end the guerrilla war that has killed 3,112 people since 1969.</p>
        <p>Prime Ministers Albert Reynolds of Ireland and John Major of Britain made a formal declaration on Dec. 15, offering Sinn Fein a place at a negotiating table in return for an end of I.R.A. violence. Sinn Fein has been considering the offer while finding fault with its language. Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, welcomed the removal of the ban, which he has long called censorship that prevented his party from making its case for a united Ireland without British control in the north. Prohibition in Britain</p>
        <p>The removal of the Irish ban did not affect a similar prohibition in effect in Britain, and there was no immediate comment from the British Government. Sinn Fein is a legal political party in the Irish Republic, where it receives about 1.6 percent of the vote, and in Northern Ireland, where it gets about 11 percent, or about 30 percent of the Roman Catholic vote in the predominantly Protestant province.</p>
        <p>The Irish Cabinet decision to end the ban drew immediate condemnation from some Irish opposition leaders here, and from Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland who oppose the ultimate Sinn Fein-I.R.A. goal: a united Ireland after Britain withdraws its troops from the province and gives up political power there.</p>
        <p>"I am horrified," said Ken Maginnis, a member of the British Parliament and a leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, which wants the province to remain part of Britain. "This is a major concession to the I.R.A. It allows the I.R.A. to justify the horrific acts they carry out." Saying "they kill while claiming to be studying" the offer made by Mr. Major and Mr. Reynolds, he added, "We've been betrayed." Differing Views</p>
        <p>Michael D. Higgins, the minister whose portfolio covered the ban, said that in making its decision the Government "took into account" that Sinn Fein was seeking more concessions before deciding whether to accept the London-Dublin conditions for peace talks. "I feel that this will assist the peace process," he said.</p>
        <p>The leader of the largest Irish opposition party, John Bruton of Fine Gael, said the decision was "wrong while the I.R.A. continue to kill Irish people for political objectives." But the leader of the smaller, Democratic Left Party, Proinsias De Rossa, said the removal would mean that "Sinn Fein and the I.R.A. are put on the spot, faced with justifying their support of murdering and killing."</p>
        <p>Under the ban, Mr. Adams and other Sinn Fein members may be shown on television, but their voices may not be heard and their words are shown in graphics on the screen.</p>
