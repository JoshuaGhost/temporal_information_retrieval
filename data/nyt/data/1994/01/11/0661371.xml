        <p>Nancy Kerrigan should begin skating again within a week after a magnetic resonance imaging test on her injured right knee yesterday showed no damage to the kneecap or ligaments, the doctor who examined Kerrigan said.</p>
        <p>"We are optimistic," Dr. Mahlon Bradley, who examined Kerrigan in Peabody, Mass., said in a statement. "The swelling in the knee has stabilized and there is an improved range of motion, although the quadricep muscle is still weak. She has a 75-degree range of motion right now. That is double the range she had at my last examination, 24 hours ago."</p>

        <p>Nancy Kerrigan should begin skating again within a week after a magnetic resonance imaging test on her injured right knee yesterday showed no damage to the kneecap or ligaments, the doctor who examined Kerrigan said.</p>
        <p>"We are optimistic," Dr. Mahlon Bradley, who examined Kerrigan in Peabody, Mass., said in a statement. "The swelling in the knee has stabilized and there is an improved range of motion, although the quadricep muscle is still weak. She has a 75-degree range of motion right now. That is double the range she had at my last examination, 24 hours ago."</p>
        <p>Apparently, there was also no cartilage damage found in the right knee, said Jerry Solomon, Kerrigan's agent.</p>
        <p>"There was no damage to anything whatsover," Solomon said in an interview last night. Exercises in Swimming Pool</p>
        <p>Kerrigan, 24, a gold medal favorite at the Winter Olympics next month in Lillehammer, Norway, withdrew from the United States Figure Skating Championships in Detroit after last Thursday's clubbing attack by an unknown assailant. She begins pool therapy today, followed by workouts on a stationary bike and, if an examination later this week is satisfactory, a return to the ice.</p>
        <p>"I am very excited about the M.R.I. results," Kerrigan said in a statement. "I am looking forward to starting my rehabilitation and my training so I can get back on the ice as soon as possible."</p>
        <p>Kerrigan was given a conditional spot on the Olympic team. She will be monitored by a panel of doctors and international figure-skating judges by Feb. 6 to determine the fitness of her knee and the quality of her skating. If Kerrigan cannot compete at the Winter Games, Michelle Kwan, the 13-year-old junior world champion, will take her place. Kwan finished second to Tonya Harding on Saturday at the United States championships. Figure-skating officials said that Olympic roster spots would remain flexible until shortly before the women begin competing on Feb. 23.</p>
        <p>Today, the police said they were positive that the suspect is a white man who wore a cap in the attack and had a stubbly beard. Saturday night, two artist's sketches were released, one depicting a while male and the other depicting a black male with a light complexion.  FIGURE SKATING</p>
