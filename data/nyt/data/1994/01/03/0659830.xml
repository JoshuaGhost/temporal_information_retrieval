        <p>Over the River and Through the Woods</p>
        <p>Just think. The same $10 billion satellite technology the Defense Department uses to target missiles and navigate sea and sky is on its way to helping Buicks and Hondas launch pinpoint visits to in-laws and shopping malls. The global positioning system of 24 satellites allows anyone with a pocket-sized receiver to deterimine their best trajectory. What if there's a glitch? Well, Tomahawk missiles might level the Paramus Park Mall as hordes of shoppers converge on Iraq's Defense Ministry clamoring for Sega's latest Sonic the Hedgehog games. For Your Business Card, An Internet Address</p>
        <p>Coming to a computer screen near you this year: more e-mail and e-papers. The hottest addition to a business card will be an Internet electronic mail address, right below your personal fax and mobile phone numbers. As for e-papers, some are already on-line, with more set for this year. Right now, say some news executives, e-news and advertising is only where television was in the 1940's. In the coming decades, they say, cryptic commands and abort, retry and fail messages will become forgotten insults to fully empowered couch potatoes.  Fortuneless Fats</p>
        <p>Maybe Calvin Trillin was right when he said that those Midwestern grain silos hold stockpiles of leftover Chicken a la King. If so, where will food and chemical processors stash all their leftover Simplesse and other Frankenstein diet compounds of the 1980's? These, remember, were to slice quivering chunks of fat from our meals and our physiques with no taste loss. Nutrasweet has already quit making Simple Pleasures, its Simplesse ice cream. Other fake fats win few nods from consumers or the F.D.A. Watch for more silos. Bart Meets Madden</p>
        <p>Boom! Bam! Doink! That's either the sound of John Madden calling a football game with Pat Summerall or Rupert Murdoch buying N.F.C. broadcast rights, $1.6 billion worth, for his Fox Network. Summerall and Madden are a team built out of succinct subtlety and Rabelesian wit, a duo that seems to have been mated since the days of Amos Alonzo Stagg. Problem is, they work for CBS, which is left without football for the first time since the Eisenhower administration. Madden's agent has already heard from Fox, however, and Bart Simpson is still available.  Have Pen Spell Gibberish</p>
        <p>Dadaist poets of the World War I era composed verses by pulling words on paper scraps out of hats. Proof, perhaps, that Apple's Newton is not ahead of its time, but seven decades behind. Meant to be the first hand-held computer to recognize written words, it instead became a babbling generator of gibberish, costing a hatful of big bills. EO, Momenta and Zoomer also proved to be less clever than their names. For now, the keyboard remains mightier than the pen. In Advertising A New Bluff</p>
        <p>Don't touch that remote control. It may seem like the same old boring ad, but it's a new and improved boring ad. Such is the plea from advertisers who prepare several different commercials in the same campaign to hold viewers who can immediately banish spots they've already seen, and seen. Advertisers want different advertisements for different audiences and shows. Sometimes, however, attacking from all sides causes unintended casualties. The barrage of 80 different ads CBS made to introduce its new late-night host left even David Letterman sputtering. He's Laughing All the Way to the Bank</p>
        <p>They call it free speech. But "The Miss Howard Stern New Year's Eve Pageant," costing $39.95 on pay-per-view, was expected to gross at least $6 million for the host. Mr. Stern has also multiplied his fortune by turning bawds, body parts and bigotry into books, books, books, plus the top-rated radio show in New York. He became a civil liberties test case once the F.C.C. fined his employer, Infinity Broadcasting, $1.2 million. Then, last week, the agency delayed the company's purchase of three large radio stations. By the time the case ends, Supreme Court Justices will probably be listening to his show. But hopefully, for safety's sake, not while they're driving.</p>
