        <p>WHEN players, coaches and officials begin to arrive in Atlanta on Monday for Super Bowl week, they will step into an intriguing conflict over a symbol. Some argue that the symbol is deeply rooted in racism; others call it an artifact of Southern culture.</p>
        <p>The dispute revolves around the public display of the Georgia state flag -- which prominently features the Confederate battle insignia -- in state buildings. The most significant of these buildings -- for the National Football League's purpose -- is the Georgia Dome, home of this year's Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>A number of civil rights groups, including the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, have protested the display of the flag and said they might demonstrate against it next week.</p>
        <p>The National Football League said it would not get involved in an emotionally charged flag issue that has festered for nearly four decades and has become an intense tug of war in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the N.F.L. reiterated its position against taking a formal stand but confined its response to a set of general comments.</p>
        <p>"Without commenting specifically on the Georgia flag or any other state flag, we in the N.F.L. do not condone any racist symbol," said Joe Browne, a league spokesman. "Every Sunday when our teams take the field is a statement to all America on where the league stands on racial diversity and minority opportunities."</p>
        <p>That statement cuts to the heart of the matter; it refers to a league with an overwhelming African-American presence on the playing field set against a symbol many think represents white supremacy and defiance.</p>
        <p>Fifteen of Kansas City's 22 starters are black, 12 of Buffalo's, 16 of Dallas's and 14 of San Francisco's.</p>
        <p>The majority of those starters were born in the South or attended college in the South. Many of them may be reluctant to touch the Confederate flag issue publicly, but they are aware of it, some more painfully than others.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the closer they get to Georgia, the more they will simmer.</p>
        <p>Jerry Rice, the 49ers' wide receiver, was born in Starkville, Miss., in 1962. Three months after he was born, there were violent protests at the University of Mississippi over the admission of the school's first black student.</p>
        <p>Rice, asked what he thought about the idea of playing a championship game under a Confederate battle flag in Georgia, said simply, "I have some bad thoughts, but I don't think it's time to address those thoughts right now."</p>
        <p>What makes the issue particularly compelling is that this year marks the 40th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark Supreme Court decision that declared separate educational facilities to be unequal. It was the first step toward major reform of race laws and policies in almost all aspects of American life.</p>
        <p>Two years after the Brown decision, the Georgia Legislature voted to adopt the current flag in an act of defiance, to protest not simply the Brown decision but also the impetus of civil rights changes sweeping the country.</p>
        <p>The display of the flag, 38 years later, seems to symbolize a persistent refusal to extirpate bigotry.</p>
        <p>The football commissioner should make a stronger, formal statement against what is essentially the Confederate battle flag flying over the National Football League's showcase event. If there is any hope of the Legislature's changing the flag by 1996, when Atlanta plays host to the Summer Olympics, pressure must be exerted from all points.</p>
        <p>Even South Africa replaced its flag and its national anthem as a condition of being allowed to compete in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.</p>
        <p>The N.F.L. thinks not.</p>
        <p>"We do not live in Georgia, we do not work in Georgia, nor do we vote in Georgia," Browne said. "We do not believe that we should go into that state as if we were a political advocacy group and threaten anyone."</p>
        <p>Four years ago, the league threatened to take the Super Bowl away from Arizona unless it passed the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. The voters, in what N.F.L. officials thought was an act of defiance, voted the King holiday down, and the league moved the 1993 Super Bowl to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>"Our experience in Arizona showed that comments or threats by state outsiders proved counterproductive," Browne said.</p>
        <p>Only in the short run. Last November, Arizona voted to adopt the holiday honoring King. Morality may have played a role in the vote, but a strong impetus was fear of losing another Super Bowl, which the state will have in 1996.</p>
        <p>Obstacles don't move on their own; force is often required.</p>
        <p>If anyone should know that, it's the N.F.L.</p>
