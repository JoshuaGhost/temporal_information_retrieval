        <p>WATER MAIN BREAKS IN BROOKLYN</p>
        <p>A 135-year-old water main ruptured in the 6-degree stillness before dawn in South Brooklyn, collapsing half a block of roadway in Carroll Gardens, flooding dozens of homes, cutting off utilities and closing the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel for the morning rush. Page 1.</p>
        <p>"We now live at 514 Lake Clinton," said a Carroll Gardens resident, in front of whose stoop yawned a frigid water-filled crater. Page 26. NEW YORK CITY ENERGETIC GOALS FOR COMMISSIONER</p>
        <p>In his first two weeks in office, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton has personally evicted a panhandler from a subway car, read the riot act to a precinct under scrutiny for corruption and made an impassioned speech in Harlem about civil rights. For the next nine months, he has more ambitious plans. Page 1.</p>
        <p>GIULIANI'S PRAISE COOLLY RECEIVED</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said that a fund-raising dinner on Monday for a conservative black politician, Roy E. Innis, was "probably the most significant Martin Luther King celebration in the New York City area." But the remark drew a frosty response from some black elected officials and civil rights advocates. Page 24.</p>
        <p>STRICTER RULES FOR SEX CLUBS</p>
        <p>In an effort to strengthen regulations to avoid transmission of the AIDS virus, the New York State Public Health Council added vaginal intercourse to the activities banned in commercial sex establishments. Page 25.</p>
        <p>DETECTIVE ACCUSED OF MOB DEAL</p>
        <p>For the second time in a month, a New York City police detective in an elite investigative unit has been implicated in a scheme to sell confidential information to organized-crime figures, law-enforcement officials said. Page 25.</p>
        <p>WHY NOT ONE OF THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE?</p>
        <p>The "collectors' limited edition" fare cards are worth $36.25 in rides but cost $50 from the Transit Authority. Here's how to order. Page 25.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the City University of New York asked an appeals court to let it dismiss Dr. Leonard Jeffries. Page 25.</p>
        <p>An official who was supposed to fight graft in New York City's school construction pleaded guilty to accepting bribes. Page 25. REGION WHITMAN HINTS TAXES MAY RISE</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said that her plan to cut income taxes should not force New Jersey municipalities to raise property taxes to make up for reductions in state aid. But she warned that she would not hold herself responsible if local spending led to higher taxes. Page 27.</p>
        <p>SLAIN BOY'S MOTHER DISAPPEARS</p>
        <p>The mother of a 5-year-old boy whom she reported missing at a carnival in May 1991, and whose remains were found in a New Jersey marsh a year later, was reported missing herself by the Middlesex County Prosecutor. Page 27.</p>
        <p>New York paid the first part of a $200 million debt to Delaware in a settlement. Page 27.</p>
