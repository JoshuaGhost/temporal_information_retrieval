        <p>Haiti's exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ended a weekend gathering of Haitian politicians here with a rousing call for unity to end military rule, but the gathering exposed fundamental differences among his supporters.</p>
        <p>Father Aristide has faced strong diplomatic pressure to embrace new allies, with the goal of isolating the military leaders who overthrew him 27 months ago.</p>
        <p>A broad range of participants in the meeting praised his approach, saying he seemed more tolerant of other views than he had been.</p>
        <p>"We know how to come together to do good things," Father Aristide said in his closing speech Sunday night. "Not only do we know how to come together to do good things, but we know how to join hands with foreigners who wish good things for Haiti." Scant Consensus</p>
        <p>But with several conservative business leaders and many others who have been unsympathetic to Father Aristide abstaining from voting, the conference offered little opportunity to build new alliances.</p>
        <p>At its end, there were a number of conflicting proposals, and many participants were left wondering what comes next.</p>
        <p>Among the recommendations were an endorsement of international military intervention in Haiti, including the possibility of arming a force of Haitian expatriates; the naming of a new Government, and the abrogation of 13-year-old agreement with the United States that allows the summary repatriation of fleeing Haitian refugees. Debate Over Refugees</p>
        <p>The resolution on refugees, approved late Sunday, prompted a State Department official to walk out in anger.</p>
        <p>But Haiti's representative to the United Nations, Fritz Longchamp, seemed to play down the likelihood that Father Aristide would annul the refugee agreement.</p>
        <p>"People can denounce anything they want, that's all well and good," Mr. Longchamp said today. "But we are a Government that has commitments that must be upheld."</p>
        <p>The 500 participants debated, sometimes angrily, over which approach would be best to break the impasse over the Haitian military's failure to honor an accord that was to have returned Father Aristide to office on Oct. 30. The sense of stalemate deepened last month with the resignation of Prime Minister Robert Malval, who had been appointed by Father Aristide.  A Call for Compromise</p>
        <p>Many participants, including members of Parliament and Cabinet ministers, urged formation of a more broadly based Government and more openness to political compromise.</p>
        <p>Father Aristide's advisers in exile, like many Haitians at the conference who live in the United States, generally opposed those ideas. They argued that the military must be removed from power before any new administration can be named and called on foreign governments to expand their efforts to isolate the military.</p>
        <p>"Those of us who are in Haiti, living the reality there with all of its threats and privations, are readier to consider compromises," said Evans Paul, the Mayor of Port-au-Prince, the capital. "The people here who live in exile are more interested in sticking to positions of principle."</p>
        <p>The suffering of Haiti's people, already the poorest in the Western Hemisphere, has deepened since the United Nations imposed an oil and arms embargo last October to step up pressure on the military.</p>
        <p>Diplomats at the conference said the United Nations Security Council would begin as early as this week to consider broadening the embargo.</p>
