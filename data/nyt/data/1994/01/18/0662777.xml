        <p>A Federal grand jury in Little Rock, Ark., will reconvene on Tuesday and begin a critical new phase in the investigation of ties between President Clinton's land development company and the owner of a failed Arkansas savings and loan.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the panel is expected to hear from several central witnesses, including Mr. Clinton's former business partner, and weigh potentially pivotal evidence from the boxes of documents the White House was ordered to turn over to Government prosecutors in recent days.</p>
        <p>The White House files -- shipped to Little Rock under F.B.I. guard -- relate to Mr. Clinton's investment in the Whitewater Development Company, the real estate concern in which the Clintons were partners with James B. McDougal, the owner of Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan taken over by Federal regulators in 1989.</p>
        <p>Mr. McDougal has been ordered to appear before the grand jury later this week. Other Clinton associates have also been subpoenaed, including Betsey Wright, Governor Clinton's chief of staff, who supervised campaign finance records.</p>
        <p>Investigators from the Justice Department are trying to determine whether Madison funds were improperly diverted to Whitewater or to help Mr. Clinton repay a $50,000 loan for his 1984 campaign for governor. Mr. Clinton has said he engaged in no wrongdoing and that he and his wife, Hillary, lost money in the Whitewater investment.</p>
        <p>As Federal prosecutors seek to understand the financial relationships between the Clintons and Mr. McDougal, Attorney General Janet Reno is scheduled to return to Washington on Tuesday evening from a trip to the Southwest. Aides say she hopes to name an independent prosecutor quickly to take over the inquiry into the President's Arkansas land dealings.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Clinton requested an independent prosecutor after months in which he and his aides dismissed news reports about his financial dealings in his home state as outdated accusations that he had already adequately explained.</p>
        <p>As the grand jury prepared to renew its deliberations, some Federal law-enforcement officials said they were unsure whether the testimony and documents obtained by the grand jury would have to be sought anew when a special prosecutor enters the case. Seeking a National Reputation</p>
        <p>The search for a lawyer to carry out the inquiry appears to be a complicated task, as Ms. Reno's aides sift through the records of prospective candidates to avoid any who might be perceived as partisan. The Attorney General's advisers said Ms. Reno wants someone with a national reputation.</p>
        <p>They also said that she wants to avoid appearing to be dragging her feet in making her choice. Some aides worked through the weekend to narrow the list of possibilities.</p>
        <p>The President's willingness to bring in someone from outside the Government to investigate has not silenced Republican critics, like Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, who continued to press for a Congressional inquiry. But Mr. Clinton's allies in Congress, like Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, have said the Republicans are simply trying to keep the issue alive long enough to embarrass Mr. Clinton in the 1996 Presidential campaign.</p>
