        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a portrait photographer who has spent a large part of my career doing both cover and author photographs for the book-publishing community, I like knowing that we now have in Dick Teresi a self-appointed chief of detectives for the Author's Photograph Police.</p>
        <p>We all know that Yousuf Karsh and Irving Penn and Richard Avedon never stooped to the use of a symbolic prop in, say, a picture of Churchill with his cigar, a tribal mud chief with his shield and spear or John Glenn in his space suit. And surely no Hollywood photographer ever did big hair for Jane Fonda or Tuesday Weld or Brigitte Bardot.</p>
        <p>What is the purpose of an author photo? I think to give a reader some subtle connection with a nonpublic person who communicates privately, through written words -- usually someone who is shy, self-conscious and nervous around a camera. We will never be far from that on-target Saturday Review cartoon of a Caspar Milquetoast author sitting in his editor's book-lined office and being told that the virile, tweed-jacketed, pipe-smoking gent sitting in the easy chair would pose for his author's photo.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, we follow the dictates of art directors and editors who want us to make the author comfortable and "look good."  ANTHONY LOEW  Weston, Conn.</p>
