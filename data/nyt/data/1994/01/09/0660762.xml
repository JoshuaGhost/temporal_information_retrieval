        <p>IF, IN THE BEGINNING, was the Word, resonant with meaning, lurking beneath it was surely the Voice, internal, vibrant with emotion. Without the voice, the impulse to communicate, there would be no drive to form the word. So should writing teachers start by helping students to find their voice? Or by helping them to shape the words into the standard vehicles of academic discourse, like a term paper or a laboratory report?</p>
        <p>The debate runs at fever pitch on many college campuses, and scholarly journals resonate not just with ideas but with surprising spleen: "naively arrogant," "perversely blind," "malicious and ill-informed," "the Rhetoric Police, that hardy band of zealots," to sample just a few issues of College English magazine.</p>
        <p>"Many people think, 'In order to show that I am right I have to show the other guys are stupid idiots,' " said Peter Elbow, who teaches at the University of Massachusetts and whose "Writing Without Teachers" (Oxford University Press, 1973) is one of the most influential books on writing of the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>The abundance of ire sometimes involves content -- in the disagreements over political correctness vs. freedom of speech or over whether to read literature in a writing class or writing by other students. Sometimes the focus is language, with advocates of multiculturalism searching for ways to broaden traditional English. And sometimes it involves form, with writing teachers not only arguing with fury but about how best to express it. The battlefield for all this is the course known as expository writing or freshman composition.</p>
        <p>In one camp stand exponents of what is known as expressive writing or personal writing, for whom Professor Elbow was an inspiration. Their underlying beliefs seem rooted in therapy as much as in writing: students have low self-esteem, little regard for their own ideas and their ability to express them. So expository writing must help them break through, to feel good about themselves, to give voice to their feelings. Connecting With the Audience</p>
        <p>On the other side are the forces of social writing, environmental writing, rhetorical writing. They emphasize helping students connect with their audiences, particularly the different departments in which they take courses. "Students do have wonderful stories to tell, and there's a great pleasure in helping a student formulate and tell the story," said Nancy Sommers, associate director of Harvard's expository writing program. "But given the 12-week semester, is that the way in which I can best help the student?" The Harvard program, Professor Sommers said, concentrates on helping students "to interpret, to become close and critical readers of primary and secondary sources."</p>
        <p>Professor Elbow rejoins: "Should the job of teaching writing to first-year students be helping them enter the community of academics? I think it's very sad to take that as the only job. That cuts students out of taking writing as an activity that they will do outside of class for the rest of their lives."</p>
        <p>In the end, the crux of the debate is about just what can be accomplished in a 12- or 14-week course. Were there world enough and time, perhaps eight semesters of required writing instead of one or two, the instructors might all end up providing their charges the same tools -- encouraging students to express themselves clearly, helping them to read and write critically, trying to encourage them to write for the rest of their lives. But one semester, even two, seems hardly enough for all this, given a typical student's language skills.</p>
        <p>Whatever the instructor's philosophy, most students write more frequently than their counterparts did in decades past -- and they often write the same papers again and again, for one major shift that nearly all writing teachers have embraced is to teach the process of writing. This means helping students to see writing as an inevitable series of drafts, revisions and self-editing.  At each stage, the students are asked to analyze their work: Is it clear? Do the ideas stay on track?</p>
        <p>Consider this self-analysis by Heather Ashley, a student at Cornell, whose essay "Leaving Vacita" and this explanation were published in "Student Writers at Work" (third edition, Bedford Books, 1989): "I wrote four drafts of my essay. The first was a lot of freewriting, just trying to get my memories and emotions down on paper. . . . In the first revision I eliminated some of the saccharine sweetness. . . . In the second revision I tried to clarify some description and events that were unclear to the reader. In the final revision I cleaned up the wording and tightened the structure a little to make it easier and clearer to read."</p>
        <p>The best setting for this process, many teachers believe, is not the traditional classroom but a more informal setting in which students can gather and help each other, with a tutor available to suggest resources or different approaches. Such arrangements, known as writing centers, are now a fixture of college life.</p>
        <p>The first centers emerged around 1970, partly in response to the work of Professor Elbow and others and partly as a way of providing remedial help to students entering college under the open admissions policies introduced at that time. Among the most ambitious early projects was that at Brooklyn College, directed by Kenneth A. Bruffee of the English Department.</p>
        <p>In a large prefabricated building near the library, with lounge areas, study compartments and round tables surrounded by chairs, students could make appointments for regular visits with tutors, drop in whenever they needed help or gather with classmates to talk through their preliminary drafts. "It worked because the students felt protected; they weren't exposed to the type of teachers who had failed them in high school," Professor Bruffee said. "But you had to teach them to give up authority to other students and accept authority for other students' work."</p>
        <p>At the University of Arizona, writing centers are offered at several sites, and help with writing assignments for any course is provided by a staff of graduate assistants and undergraduate tutors, led by Tilly Warnock, the program director. "Rather than thinking of remediation, we think of the students as less experienced," said Dr. Warnock. 'This Is Writing as a Social Process'</p>
        <p>Similarly, Lisa Ede, director of the Center for Writing and Learning at Oregon State University, talks of "our emphasis on collaboration and on peer response; this is writing as a social process." The feedback from peers is essential, Professor Ede said, because it makes writing seem like problem solving: "Here's what I know about what I want to say; here's what I know about my audiences."</p>
        <p>Roy Peter Clark, who has taught writing on and off campus and is now dean of the faculty at the Poynter Institute in St. Petersburg, Fla., said: "You're asking inexperienced writers to believe that they can make things happen. They've probably had negative experiences, been told they couldn't do it. You're letting them know it's possible to be experts on some topics that they choose to write about." In this view, the writing teacher is something akin to an orchestra conductor: a resource, perhaps an inspiration, and ultimately, though no teacher likes the label, the enforcer of standards.</p>
        <p>"English is no longer what English was," observed Dr. Warnock of Arizona, taking note of the multi-ethnic, multiracial student bodies on hers and many other campuses. "We want to acknowledge the different rhetorics that people bring into the university and work with them, to be able to connect the forms they are using in their lives and in the languages they speak with academic discourse." Crossing Curriculums</p>
        <p>In addition to moving much writing instruction out of the classroom, another camp is pushing to move it beyond the English Department, a movement known as writing across the curriculum. The idea is to keep students writing -- and keep teachers involved with writing development -- through all four years of course work. At Ohio State University, for example, the new curriculum requires all students to take a semester of freshman writing, followed by a sophomore writing course that focuses "on some aspect of the American experience, and which can be taught in any department," said Andrea Lunsford, associate chair of the English Department and overseer of all writing instruction. Third-year students take a course in their major that focuses on writing.</p>
        <p>"We're only 1 of 32 courses, so writing must be the shared intellectual responsibility of all members of the academic community," said Professor Sommers of Harvard.</p>
        <p>As student bodies in the last 20 years have grown more diverse, colleges and teachers were challenged to find new ways to deal with large numbers of students whose reading, writing, analytical and computational skills were not up to traditional college standards. One response was to try to work with alternative, non-standard language, as in the debate over black English. Now a middle ground seems to have emerged, which holds that whatever might be acceptable in creative or expressive writing, traditional language should be mastered to deal with the college community and institutions beyond it.</p>
        <p>"There is something called standard written English that we want all students to master," Professor Elbow said. "That seems to be a consensus now, and while some people would call that white English, there is a broad agreement that students need that."</p>
        <p>This particular debate now goes on under the banner of multiculturalism, which at its most basic means enriching the curriculum by exposing students to many voices and different value systems. But at some schools, particularly where what writing teachers call the "left critique" holds sway, multiculturalism is thornier and insisting on standard English is a matter of debate.</p>
        <p>As Alan W. France of West Chester University in Pennsylvania wrote in an essay in last October's issue of College English about introductory composition, "Its content is the set of discursive rules that assign students to their proper place in the institutional hierarchies of corporate capitalism."</p>
        <p>A less ideological observation that penetrates to the center of the Voice vs. Word debate comes from Professor Lunsford of Ohio State. "For most of my career, composition studies went blithely along saying we're the good guys, the liberators," she said. "But the happy assumption that everything we do is benign has been lost, and that's a good thing. For every move you make to bring someone into the linguistic code you are likely to exclude someone else, and as I am able to release one voice I'm giving up other voices."</p>
        <p>She pointed to Richard Rodriguez, the Mexican-American author of "Hunger of Memory" and "Days of Obligation: An Argument With My Mexican Father." "He has made it mainstream," she said, "and he is reviled by Mexican-Americans as a sellout, a Mexican Uncle Tom." Indeed, Victor Villanueva, a Latino who is professor of rhetoric at Northern Arizona University, said: "Look at the popularity, in the last 10 years, of Richard Rodriguez. He argues the case for assimilation in a way that gave everyone a sigh of relief. But now in composition circles, there's a general rejection, because he is viewed as overly assimilist."</p>
        <p>One way to assess the debates on multiculturalism, said James F. Slevin, chairman of the English Department at Georgetown University, is to appreciate how the terminology is used. Referring to multiculturalism as diversity "sanitizes some of the power issues," he said, invoking "an equality of culture, some resonance with melting-pot theories, a benign look at people working together." Another perspective, he said, is to see differences -- "to look at the richness of men and women, whites and others, with an eye to the power relationships between them."</p>
        <p>But while all these various battles rage, a centrist force of peacekeepers has gathered strength. "We need to keep finding the middle ground," said Jacqueline Jones Royster, director of the university writing program at Ohio State University and the next head of the Conference on College Composition and Communications (known as Four C's), the main professional body of teachers of writing.  "There are many ways to find options when you have a desire to bring cultures together or cross boundaries." That middle ground, she said, means helping students "develop the sensibilities toward punctuation, spelling, grammar, sentence structure," but also "teaching students to think, to gain access to information, to be communicators who can operate flexibly." A Highly Visible Role in the Debate</p>
        <p>Professor Royster, an African-American, is one of the few minority group members to gain a highly visible role in the debate over the teaching of writing. Professor Villanueva observed, "We have a large constituency, but when it comes to people of color teaching English our numbers are low." While the number is growing, aided by Four C's and other programs, "whether we've had the ear of publishers, whether we've had the access we might like" is a different matter, Professor Royster said. And she added, "Is that different than other areas of the university, other areas of life?"</p>
