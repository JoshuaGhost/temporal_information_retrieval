        <p>No dish changes quite as much from season to season as soup. Summer's soups are bowls of chilled pastel strewn with herbs. If hot they are sheer, insubstantial broths afloat with seafood. In winter they turn steaming and thick to serve with slabs of rustic, crusty bread. Bean soups fortified with meat, sturdy root vegetable purees and chunky chowders whet cold weather appetites.</p>
        <p>No sort of meal assembly is a easy as one based on soup. And although the best winter soups may depend on freshly-made long- simmering stocks, dried beans soaked overnight then tended as they cook for hours and tough cuts of meat or fowl stewed until they fall apart. There are shortcuts however.</p>
        <p>For example, in place of beans cooked from scratch there are various canned beans. White, black, pinto, kidney beans or chick peas can be used whole or pureed. And whereas the texture of canned beans is often too soft, unsatisfactory to use plain, they are perfect for soup.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the extra potatoes, carrots, turnips or other root vegetables cooked for one meal can be turned into a sturdy puree to thin with skim milk, stock or water. Keep canned or frozen corn or peas, frozen chopped spinach and canned tomatoes on hand for quick soups. Thin plain canned pumpkin puree with lowfat milk and season it with curry powder and you have soup.</p>
        <p>Leftover stew, pasta dishes, grains and roasted meat or poultry can easily be stretched into soup. Cooked or smoked fish could be the main ingredient of a chowder. A swirl of summer's frozen pesto, or the jarred kind from a market can dress a soup for company. And many soups can be enhanced with a dusting of parmesan cheese. The possibilities are truly infinite.</p>
        <p>Here are some ideas for quick, unusual but ribsticking soups, two of them virtually fat-free. Some good, dense bread or rolls, a salad or slaw and dessert are all you need to make a meal, even one to serve to guests. CHICKEN SOUP WITH GARLIC, POTATOES AND GREENS Total time: 30 minutes  1 ounce slab bacon, diced  1 large onion, diced  4 large cloves garlic, sliced thin  1 1/2 pounds boiling potatoes, peeled and sliced 1/2 inch thick  2 quarts chicken stock  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  5 cups, packed, finely shredded kale or Swiss chard  2 cups cooked chicken, pulled into chunks by hand  Freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
        <p>1. Heat the bacon in a large, heavy saucepan. When the fat is rendered stir in the onion and cook over low heat until the onion is tender but not brown. Stir in the garlic and cook a minute or so longer.</p>
        <p>2. Add the potatoes and stock. Bring to a boil, season with some salt and pepper and cook until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. Partly mash the potatoes in the saucepan, then stir them to partly dissolve them.</p>
        <p>3. Add the greens and chicken pieces, bring to a simmer and cook for about 5 minutes, until the greens are tender. Check seasonings.</p>
        <p>4. Serve the soup with grated Parmesan cheese on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings WHITE BEAN AND ENDIVE SOUP Total time: 40 minutes  1 pound endives  Juice of 1/2 lemon  2 cloves garlic, minced  3 1/2 cups chicken stock  1/2 cup cooked white (cannellini) beans  Salt and freshly ground white pepper</p>
        <p>1. Wash the endives and trim off the cores. Chop them and put them in a heavy saucepan with the lemon juice. Cover and cook over very low heat until the endives are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic.</p>
        <p>2. Add the chicken stock and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Puree the soup in a blender or a food processor, then return it to the saucepan.</p>
        <p>4. Puree the beans and stir them into the saucepan and simmer another 5 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 6 servings BAKED TOMATO AND BREAD SOUP Total time: 1 1/2 hours  2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil  1/2 cup chopped onion  3 cloves garlic, chopped  A 28-ounce can plum tomatoes  Salt and freshly-ground black pepper  6 thin slices country bread, lightly toasted  1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the oil in a heavy skillet. Add the onion and saute over medium heat until golden. Stir in the garlic.</p>
        <p>3. Chop the tomatoes with their juice and add to the skillet. Season the mixture to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Line the bottom of a 2 quart oven-proof mixing bowl or deep baking dish with 2 slices of the bread. Sprinkle with two tablespoons of the cheese and spoon half the tomato mixture over it. Add 2 more slices of the bread, 2 more tablespoons of the cheese and the rest of the tomato mixture. Top with the remaining bread and cheese. The juices from the tomato mixture should come about to the level of the top layer of the bread. If they do not, add a little water.</p>
        <p>5. Cover the dish tightly with foil, place in the oven and bake about 1 hour, until the soup is bubbling and has puffed up. Serve at once. Yield: 2 to 4 servings  FOOD</p>
