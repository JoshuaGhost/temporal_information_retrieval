        <p>At 1 P.M. yesterday, Tina Byrd picked up the telephone at Headquarters for Hair, where she is a stylist, and took another step in the long goodbye to her son, Sherif. After almost five and a half years, the police called to tell her that they had arrested someone in the murder of the 10-year-old Bronx choirboy, who was shot to death on a summer day as he played in the spray of a fire hydrant.</p>
        <p>"It was a sigh of relief but it won't bring him back," Ms. Byrd said with composure but sadness as she worked at the shop in the Highbridge section of the Bronx. Her voice was soft, her words deliberate. "It doesn't put my mind at rest because I'll always miss him."</p>

        <p>At 1 P.M. yesterday, Tina Byrd picked up the telephone at Headquarters for Hair, where she is a stylist, and took another step in the long goodbye to her son, Sherif. After almost five and a half years, the police called to tell her that they had arrested someone in the murder of the 10-year-old Bronx choirboy, who was shot to death on a summer day as he played in the spray of a fire hydrant.</p>
        <p>"It was a sigh of relief but it won't bring him back," Ms. Byrd said with composure but sadness as she worked at the shop in the Highbridge section of the Bronx. Her voice was soft, her words deliberate. "It doesn't put my mind at rest because I'll always miss him."</p>
        <p>Sherif S. Byrd was hit in the back with a stray shot from a .357 Magnum during an Aug. 12, 1988, shootout between four drug dealers. He was playing with friends on Jesup Place near his home on a crack-infested block in the Morris Heights section.</p>
        <p>The police said yesterday that a 32-year-old man, Amado Pichardo, had been charged with second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon after he was found by the police in Rochester. His bullet, they said, hit Sherif in the back that Friday afternoon after Mr. Pichardo shot at three other drug dealers who had tried to rob him.</p>
        <p>The police arrested two of the drug dealers at that time and had sought Mr. Pichardo ever since. They received reports that he had been seen in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. On Friday, Mr. Pichardo was arrested by the Rochester police as he walked out of a bar, where he had been under investigation for drug-related charges and also known as a suspect in the shooting of Sherif.</p>
        <p>Detectives John Hennessy and Gerard Dunn of the 44th Precinct Detective Squad in the Bronx drove 6 hours through the snow to Rochester and 10 hours back to New York on Monday with Mr. Pichardo.</p>
        <p>"What makes this especially rewarding is not only that it involved an old case or that it involved a tragedy in the murder of 10-year-old boy," said Lieut. James Malvey, commander of the 44th Precinct detective squad, "but also at times you've heard and we've heard that we don't devote personnel and time to homicide cases in certain parts of the city. This shows that this is not true."</p>
        <p>Detective Hennessy, who made the call to Ms. Byrd, said, "It feels good, especially getting a guy off the street who killed a 10-year-old kid who was an innocent victim."</p>
        <p>He said Mrs. Byrd told him: "I appreciate everything you did. It was a long time. You didn't give up on the case."</p>
        <p>Morris Heights never forgot Sherif, either, and yesterday there was relief that a suspect in his killing was behind bars. The neighborhood is quieter these days, but there are still drugs on the block. Sherif's killing was one of the first in what has become an onslaught of random violence against children. A Community in Pain</p>
        <p>"It affected that community drastically," said Tony Aguilar, a community worker who lives in the Bronx and once worked for South Bronx Churches, an organization of clergy members and lay people. "It's really small solace for the family, but you're always glad when someone who cut short a life like that is apprehended."</p>
        <p>Sherif had been eulogized as a "bright little star" by the firefighter who tried to save him as he lay dying. In 1990, Jesup Place was renamed Sherif S. Byrd Place in his honor and in honor of all the other young lives lost in drug-related violence since then. Every year, Mount Cella Baptist Church holds a service for Sherif, who was a former choir member, junior usher and member of the New York City Mission Cadet Corps drill team.</p>
        <p>After Sherif was killed, Ms. Byrd sent her only surviving child, Kamarine, now 18, to live with his maternal grandmother in another section of the Bronx. She left the neighborhood two years later and returns only for the annual memorial service for Sherif.</p>
        <p>"I just had to get away from there," she said, almost whispering. 'Raised in the Church'</p>
        <p>"He was raised in the church," she said suddenly. "Even on a Sunday he got up at 6 o'clock and be ready to go to church at 8 o'clock."</p>
        <p>Vicki Williams, a former neighbor of the Byrds who still lives on the block, yesterday recalled hearing the shots and running out to find Sherif's body next to the fire hydrant.</p>
        <p>"I'm ecstatic," she said of Mr. Pichardo's arrest. "When someone takes your loved one away from you they can't be replaced. It's a relief to know they're getting some kind of punishment. Look at all the time he's had free. She can't get back the time with her son."</p>
        <p>The Rev. Isaac B. Crawford of Mount Cella, who started the street-renaming campaign, vowed to sit through the trial. "The system might be kind of slow, but it does work," he said. "There were some in our membership and people on the block saying he would never be caught."</p>
