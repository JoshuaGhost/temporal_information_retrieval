        <p>When Lisa Fremer, a business manager for the music industry, and her son, Ross, regained their composure after the Los Angeles earthquake, they discovered that they were rather lucky. They were both unhurt. Their 1,500-square-foot Sherman Oaks home, in the San Fernando Valley, was still standing, while other houses within blocks had collapsed. But the house and its contents were damaged, and the financial impact was serious.</p>
        <p>Even though Ms. Fremer has carried earthquake insurance since 1984, at a cost of $775 a year, the policy's high deductible means many repairs to her house and the replacement of many household items will have to be made out of pocket. Rejected for a loan from the Federal Emergency Management Agency because of her income level, Ms. Fremer will probably borrow from other sources to make up the differences.</p>

        <p>"We've received 20,000 claims and by being organized and by working with us, Mr. Fremer has speeded up the processing of her claim," said John Willen, a spokesman for the Farmers Insurance Group.  HOW THEY DO IT</p>
