        <p>THE DIANA CORPORATION, a meat and seafood distributor, "is one of the more obscure companies on the Big Board," Business Week wrote in touting the stock in the Inside Wall Street column that went to press in the wee hours of Jan. 20. So why, before advance copies were sent out after the close of trading that day, did volume jump as the price rose 50 cents to $7.75?</p>
        <p>The column was thrust into the spotlight in 1988, after its author noticed suspect pre-publication gains in some stocks he wrote about. A leak later was found at R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, which prints Business Week.</p>

        <p>THE DIANA CORPORATION, a meat and seafood distributor, "is one of the more obscure companies on the Big Board," Business Week wrote in touting the stock in the Inside Wall Street column that went to press in the wee hours of Jan. 20. So why, before advance copies were sent out after the close of trading that day, did volume jump as the price rose 50 cents to $7.75?</p>
        <p>The column was thrust into the spotlight in 1988, after its author noticed suspect pre-publication gains in some stocks he wrote about. A leak later was found at R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons, which prints Business Week.</p>
        <p>Mark Morrison, managing editor, dismissed the activity in Diana, noting that neither of the two other stocks mentioned in the column gained until after the magazine's release. Could sources on the Diana story have divined that publication was imminent and bought? Mr. Morrison doesn't think so. He said that while volume was high on Jan. 20, compared with the previous week, equally heavy trading days can be spotted over several months. SUSAN ANTILLA</p>
