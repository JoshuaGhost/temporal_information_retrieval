        <p>To the Editor: On July 16, 1993, I took a flight from Athens to New York on Olympic Airways. One of the passengers, obviously quite ill and receiving oxygen, was being flown home on a stretcher, which was placed in the smoking section. Apart from any safety issue relating to him, I raised the question of the danger to everyone on board, possibly from an explosion caused by sparks or flames in the presence of oxygen.</p>
        <p>I wrote the Federal Aviation Administration and in August received a reply from the aviation safety hot-line program manager, Sally S. Ryberg. She said that the smoking occurred while the plane was in international airspace. "The F.A.A. does not have jurisdiction in this instance," she wrote. She said that letters about the matter had been sent to the Greek authorities and to Olympic Airways.</p>

        <p>I find it very troubling that no safety regulation bars such a situation. SUSAN SCHINDLER  New York, N.Y. John G. Kessanis, manager of support services for Olympic Airways, responds: On the 747 flight mentioned by Ms. Schindler, the relatives of the patient were mostly smokers and asked that the stretcher be placed near them, one of two possible sites for stretchers. The patient did not receive oxygen continuously, but only in event of need. A spokesman for the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency based on Montreal, comments: the placement of ill passengers aboard planes is not part of the ICAO safety rules but is under the control of an airline's home government.</p>
