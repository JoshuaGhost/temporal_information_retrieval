        <p>The forced resignation last week of Philip B. Heymann, the second-highest official at the Justice Department, brought to the surface long-simmering tensions in the agency's top ranks.</p>
        <p>For months Justice Department lawyers said it had grown increasingly evident that Attorney General Janet Reno was tiring of Mr. Heymann and the scholarly ways of the 61-year-old Harvard law professor. In an uncomfortable joint news conference, each blamed conflicts in approach and an absence of chemistry, but neither would discuss specific grievances.</p>
        <p>Some of Ms. Reno's aides said they hoped the move would help her organize a department overwhelmed by a bulging agenda of crime, civil rights and law enforcement issues. But Mr. Heymann's departure created its own problems, saddling Ms. Reno, who has struggled for months to fill top jobs in civil rights, drug enforcement and the environment, with another vexing personnel problem. Aides say she is in a hurry to find a successor, someone experienced and decisive, but who would easily win Senate confirmation without provoking a partisan examination of the Clinton Justice Department.
