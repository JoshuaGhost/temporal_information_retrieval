        <p>'Rain or Shine'</p>
        <p>The Paper Bag Players  The Kaye Playhouse  68th Street (between Park and Lexington Avenues)  (212) 772-4448  Recommended ages: 4 to 9  Through March 6</p>
        <p>When Donald Ashwander of the Paper Bag Players starts playing his electric harpsichord at the beginning of the show, the audience automatically starts giggling (maybe it's Mr. Ashwander's white bucks). Then all the children clap and perch themselves at the edge of their seats, where they remain for the entire show.</p>
        <p>After writing and directing the Paper Bag shows for 36 years, Judith Martin, now in her 70's, is still mysteriously attuned to children. The mixture of vaudeville, slapstick, mime and all those paper bags miraculously converge into a program both original and imaginative, with not a whiff of pedantry in the air.</p>
        <p>In this show, one skit is about yellow taxis parked at an elephant crossing. Two elephants appear, mammoth and pink-mouthed, and the audience fervently helps the Players find the mastodons when they disappear. In another skit, macho King Rough-and-Tough intends to slay a red dragon with a cardboard sword. In the Big Lady act, a gigantic paper lady, flashing a diamond the size of Elizabeth Taylor's, hogs a park bench. And in the Ice and Sun act, Winter (an actor covered in wax paper), refuses to leave until, eventually, he realizes, "It's the sun: he's going to ruin everything."</p>
        <p>The hourlong programs are at 2 P.M. Saturdays and Sundays. Tickets are $14.  Playland Ice Casino</p>
        <p>Rye Playland  Rye, N.Y.  (914) 921-0370 or (914) 967-7206  Recommended ages: 2 and up  Through April 10</p>
        <p>Ever on the lookout for ice-skating rinks, we ignored the frigid temperatures last Sunday and drove up to Westchester County to see whether this indoor beachside rink is a place worth knowing about. It is. The spectacular honeycombed-wood dome ceiling gives the 1928 National Historic Landmark an ambiance that may have you looking around for Jay Gatsby in a beaver-collared coat and skates the color of polished coal. The music, sort of Peggy Lee-ish, appeals more to grown-ups than to children, but they skate along, anyway. Friday nights offers a live d.j.</p>
        <p>The main rink was very crowded; as one father noted, many skaters who normally go to outdoor rinks may have headed to Playland because of the frigid temperatures. There are, in fact, three rinks: one for casual skating, one for very young skaters, the studio for parties and lessons. The main rink is where you want to be, though the kiddie one is where you may start out. At this tiny patch, a 7-year-old boy was learning how to stop, coached by his father, who leaned over the railing to say things like, "That last one was perfect."</p>
        <p>The main rink offers balcony and up-close bleacher seats. On the whole, the skaters, including children, were a very competent group, with a few daredevils and not many turned-in ankles. The line for rentals was very long. The unattractive cafeteria (no Gatsby sighting here) sells snack foods.</p>
        <p>Admission is $4.50 for adults, $3.25 for children 12 and under; spectators pay $1.50 on weekends and holidays. Skate rentals are $3. Hours at the main rink are Tuesdays, 3 to 5:30 P.M.; Wednesdays through Sundays, 1:30 to 5:30 P.M.; Thursdays and Sundays, 8:30 to 10:30 P.M. and Fridays and Saturdays, 8:30 to 11 P.M. The kiddie rink is open Tuesdays through Fridays, 3:30 to 5:30 P.M., and on weekends from 1:30 to 5:30 P.M. Parking is free. To reach Playland by car, use Exit 19 off the New England Thruway (I-95).</p>
