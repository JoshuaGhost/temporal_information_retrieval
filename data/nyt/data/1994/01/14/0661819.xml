        <p>When President Clinton stepped up to the lectern at a fund-raising reception for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan at the Waldorf-Astoria last month, he joked: "Before I met Pat Moynihan, I actually thought I knew something about Government.

        <p>Unfortunately for Mr. Clinton, his latest grades from the professor-turned-Senator have been well below average -- so lackluster that the New York Democrat has made a public example of his student several times in recent days, to the irritation and embarrassment of the White House.</p>

        <p>When President Clinton stepped up to the lectern at a fund-raising reception for Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan at the Waldorf-Astoria last month, he joked: "Before I met Pat Moynihan, I actually thought I knew something about Government. Now I just feel like I'm getting a grade every time I talk in front of him."</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Mr. Clinton, his latest grades from the professor-turned-Senator have been well below average -- so lackluster that the New York Democrat has made a public example of his student several times in recent days, to the irritation and embarrassment of the White House.</p>
        <p>In the Senator's latest critique, one that the President heard half a world away in Brussels this week, Mr. Moynihan called for an independent counsel to investigate the role of Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary, in a failed Arkansas real estate venture.</p>
        <p>The remark, on a national television news program on Sunday, is only the latest. The same day, Mr. Moynihan did nothing for Mr. Clinton's health care package by declaring that "we don't have a health care crisis in America."</p>
        <p>And on welfare, Mr. Clinton's other major domestic initiative, Mr. Moynihan declared to The New York Post last week that the President was not serious about reform and was using the issue as "boob bait for the Bubbas."</p>
        <p>Relishing his new role as a legislative gatekeeper, he also threatened that if the White House did not make good on its promises on welfare, "I just might hold health care hostage."</p>
        <p>While Mr. Moynihan has never shied away from speaking his often unpredictable mind, his seemingly off-hand utterances have taken on a new weight since Mr. Clinton came to Washington. The President picked Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas to be his Treasury Secretary, making way for Mr. Moynihan to ascend to the chairmanship of the Senate Finance Committee. And in that post, Mr. Moynihan, always one of the giant intellects on Capitol Hill, now is one of the giant powers on Capitol Hill, too. Straight Talk by Nature</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan, who said he was motivated only by his pursuit of sound public policy and a desire to look after constituents, said it was in his nature to give straight answers. Recalling the circumstances on Sunday when he was asked whether he would support an independent counsel on the Whitewater matter, he said: "I'm sitting on 'Meet the Press.' Lisa Myers turns to you. You don't bumble and say, 'I haven't thought about that.' "</p>
        <p>Scoffing at the notion that there was tension with the White House, Mr. Moynihan said that he "couldn't ask for a warmer relationship" with Mr. Clinton. "There's an advise and consent sort of relationship," he said. "I'm surprised they are as attentive as they are."</p>
        <p>As Mr. Clinton is learning, even the most casual remarks -- the kind that could have been be dismissed before the Senator assumed such influence -- can threaten to steer the President's proposals off course. Yet White House officials find they can do little but simmer in private, fearing that if they strike, Mr. Moynihan will only retaliate.</p>
        <p>"There's not much you can do about it," said one of several senior White House officials who complained in private but refused to attach their names to anything remotely critical of the Senator. "He's in charge of a lot of things we hope to accomplish."</p>
        <p>Maybe that is why George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to the President, insisted that there were no hard feelings between Mr. Clinton and the Senator. "I don't think that in any of these cases the Senator intended to do the President any harm," he said. "As far as some of the public comments, I think the Senator's a brilliant man who is often misunderstood." A Rocky Beginning</p>
        <p>One reason White House officials are so sensitive is that the Clinton-Moynihan relationship got off to a sour start when an anonymous Administration official told Time Magazine a year ago, "We'll roll right over him if we have to."</p>
        <p>The comment infuriated the Senator -- who had publicly complained that the President and his top aides had not sought his counsel in the early days of the Administration -- and left Mr. Clinton rushing to mend fences with him. They were at peace for much of the year, with the President crediting Mr. Moynihan for shepherding his budget plan through Congress. But some of the Senator's old qualms have apparently resurfaced.</p>
        <p>"I don't think the Administration has shown the kind of deference they need to here," said Brian Lunde, a Democratic political strategist. "The care and feeding of certain committee chairs is a requirement for a President. If they don't respect the independent power that Senator Moynihan has, they're going to pay a price for it."</p>
        <p>The price, often, is that Mr. Moynihan speaks. His words can be so subtle in their savagery that they have a long afterlife, as in the week before Mr. Clinton took office, when the Senator mentioned that he was distressed to hear "the clatter of campaign promises being tossed out the window."</p>
        <p>Though that comment may have resulted from Mr. Moynihan's frustration with the White House at the time, his advisers say he sees his role as prodding Mr. Clinton in what he believes is the right direction.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Moynihan acknowledged that what he believes is right may translate into what is right for his constituents, like protecting his state's medical establishment as health care is considered.</p>
        <p>"Every major piece of social legislation in the last 70 years has had to pass through the toll gates of Southern committee chairmen," he said. "Now there's a New Yorker who's chairman of the Finance Committee for the first time in 155 years. You can say Senator Moynihan is devoted to his constituents in New York. Put that down." Unanticipated Results</p>
        <p>But why can't Mr. Moynihan keep his counsel in private?</p>
        <p>One reason, no doubt, is that politicians have more impact when they offer advice to millions of people on television. That way, they can be sure the message gets to the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Lawrence O'Donnell, a senior adviser to Mr. Moynihan, acknowledged that his boss does not always anticipate the impact of his word choices, as in using the hot-button word "crisis" to talk about health care. "If you ever tried to run him as a Vice Presidential candidate," he said, "you'd have trouble because you'd have trouble programming his language."</p>
        <p>As furious as some at the White House are over Mr. Moynihan's comments, sometimes the President will do the unexpected: follow his advice.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Clinton plays the good student and listens to Mr. Moynihan, he may be rewarded with a pat on the back from the teacher. That's what happened after Mr. Clinton requested a special counsel on the Whitewater venture.</p>
        <p>"The President has made the right decision," Mr. Moynihan said after the White House announcement Wednesday. "I am not surprised. He is an honorable man doing the honorable thing." In this case, the student gets an A.</p>
