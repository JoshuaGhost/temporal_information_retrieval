        <p>For MCI, the path to what it calls "the information superhighway" may have to pass through turn-of-the-century underground telegraph tubes.</p>
        <p>Parts of the MCI Communications Corporation's $2 billion planned alternative to the local phone networks will be built with assets the company bought nearly four years ago from Western Union. The holdings include underground wooden, clay or plastic conduits laid by Western Union to hold telegraph lines.

        <p>For MCI, the path to what it calls "the information superhighway" may have to pass through turn-of-the-century underground telegraph tubes.</p>
        <p>Parts of the MCI Communications Corporation's $2 billion planned alternative to the local phone networks will be built with assets the company bought nearly four years ago from Western Union. The holdings include underground wooden, clay or plastic conduits laid by Western Union to hold telegraph lines. Through these pipes, some dating to the 19th century, must run the high-capacity fiber optic lines that will make possible video conferencing, video-on-demand and other services.</p>
        <p>In a news conference yesterday, Bert Roberts, the chairman of MCI, emphasized that the Western Unionconduits would provide the backbone of a network for more than 2,000 buildings in more than 200 cities, including the nation's 20 largest cities. MCI said construction had already begun in Atlanta and would be completed by midyear. MCI's stated goal: link directly to its corporate customers, rather than pay costly "access" charges to reach them through the local telephone networks.</p>
        <p>But in a telephone conference with reporters yesterday, Mr. Roberts seemed to indicate that the proposed network might also be a useful lobbying tool. Asked whether MCI intended to wage "regulatory war" at the state and Federal levels to reduce access charges, Mr. Roberts said MCI would wage "the biggest war we can possibly make." Access Charges High</p>
        <p>MCI collects annual revenue of more than $12 billion, but up to 45 percent of that is immediately returned to local phone companies in access charges.</p>
        <p>Other telecommunications companies had considered buying the Western Union pipes, but found them in disrepair and, in many cases, in locations that would not be useful for reaching some of the most lucrative corporate customers.</p>
        <p>"A lot of the conduits were old and completely collapsed -- especially the wooden and clay ones," said an executive at a telephone company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "But even if they were good, they wouldn't give you near the coverage. A lot of them are clustered near the railroad, and the center of town has moved away from the railroad since the turn of the century."</p>
        <p>His company was one of more than two dozen telephone and cable companies that considered buying the Western Union assets.</p>
        <p>Western Union, operating under bankruptcy protection at the time, put the conduits up for sale in 1989 as part of its move to sell the company's Advanced Transmission Systems unit, which operated and leased fiber optic lines. Pipes Sold for $30 Million</p>
        <p>Western Union's asking price was $200 million, but the final sale price -- more than a year later -- was less than $30 million, because MCI bought only the conduits of Advanced Transmission, which is no longer in business.</p>
        <p>"Put it all together, and the whole thing just wasn't a good fit," recalled an executive at another telecommunications company that looked at the Western Union assets and passed. "The city that was in the best shape was Atlanta because a lot of the pipe there was plastic that was built or refurbished in 1988 and 1989 just before the sale."</p>
        <p>Warren R. Bechtel, a spokesman for the New Valley Corporation, the successor company to Western Union, sharply disputed the criticisms of the assets it sold MCI.  "Those claims are absurd," he said. "Starting in the 1970's, a lot of money was spent to upgrade that network because we were thinking of expanding at that time."</p>
        <p>Gary M. Parsons, the new chief executive of MCI Metro, the company MCI has created to run its local networks, acknowledged that some of the Western Union conduits were built for long-defunct telegraph lines. But he said that MCI was aggressively buying conduits from utilities or other companies to complement the Western Union lines.</p>
        <p>In Atlanta, for example, the Western Union lines cover downtown Atlanta, but not the fast-growing Buckhead and Perimeter Center areas in the suburbs. MCI is buying additional conduits for those areas.  BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY</p>
