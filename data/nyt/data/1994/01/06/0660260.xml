        <p>The Mexican armed forces pressed their counterattack on peasant guerrillas today, sending rocket-equipped planes and helicopter gunships into the hills after the retreating rebels.</p>
        <p>Just outside San Cristobal de las Casas, the second-largest city in the state of Chiapas, military planes that had bombed the guerrillas on Tuesday attacked today with rockets and machine guns on a hillside where the only people in evidence were local peasants and journalists in well-marked vehicles, some of whom were nearly hit.</p>
        <p>The Defense Ministry reported that at least 95 people had been killed in the fighting. It said that 61 of them were guerrillas, 7 of them army soldiers and the remaining 27 civilians, and that the insurgents of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation had abandoned or been routed from nearly all of the towns and hamlets they had seized on New Year's Day.</p>
        <p>But in many parts of this region near Mexico's border with Guatemala there were few signs that Government authority had returned.</p>
        <p>Poking through the destruction from two days of fighting here between Government troops and hundreds of rebels, residents found the bodies of at least seven young men in rebel uniform who had apparently been executed in the town's marketplace after being captured. For their part, Government officials accused the rebels of summarily executing two policemen and kidnapping many civilians.</p>
        <p>Human rights advocates were quick to express concern about possible abuses because of what they described as a longstanding pattern of army and police mistreatment of the Indians in the area.</p>
        <p>"We are really concerned about what has been coming out on this," said Ellen Lutz, the principal investigator for Mexico for Human Rights Watch, a New York-based private group. Speaking by telephone from Los Angeles, she added, "My preoccupation would be that as the Government gets control of these areas, that it accept international human rights standards and that there not be mass sweeps of villages and arbitrary arrests and detentions." Investigations Ordered</p>
        <p>Such comments suggested the difficulty that the Mexican Government now faces in trying to combat a guerrilla movement that made its first appearance in a stunning offensive of as many as 2,000 fighters and now appears to have slipped back into the hills largely intact.</p>
        <p>A senior official of the Secretariat of Government, Mexico's Interior Ministry, Eloy Cantu Segovia, said in an interview that the evidence of killings of prisoners, excessive force and an air force attack on the journalists was being investigated. If such abuses were proved, he said, those responsible would be punished.</p>
        <p>The head of the Government's National Commission of Human Rights, Jorge Madrazo, flew to San Cristobal this afternoon. Fact-finding teams from at least half a dozen Mexican and foreign human rights groups were also being dispatched to the area.</p>
        <p>The Government has pledged repeatedly to use its military forces only in a defensive manner, and initially army troops appeared not to seek out the guerrillas. When about 300 members of the Zapatista Army occupied San Cristobal, a city of about 85,000 people that was full of foreign tourists for the holidays, army troops nearby did nothing initially. Bombs Dropped on Hillside</p>
        <p>But as the rebels began to move out of San Cristobal, attacking an army garrison on the edge of the city, the military began stepping up its response. Army troops swarmed into the area with helicopters and armored personnel carriers.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday afternoon, in what officials said was the defense of army troops pinned down by the guerrillas, Government planes dropped an undetermined number of bombs on the hillside around a tiny hamlet called El Corralito, scattering the residents who remained. It was unclear whether anyone had been hurt or killed.</p>
        <p>Reporters who visited the area, about four miles outside the city, found it deserted except for a handful of poor residents. But as two carloads of journalists began to leave in cars marked "Press" and "TV" on their doors, windows and roofs, two single-engine military planes began diving, rocketing and machine-gunning in their path, missing one of the vehicles with a rocket by about 40 feet, the reporters said.</p>
        <p>"The planes were shooting at us," said Bruno Lopez, a veteran correspondent for the television network Univision, who was pinned down by his van with other members of his crew. "I don't think they would do it deliberately. It was just dumb -- maybe because they are not used to this kind of war."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cantu, the Government Secretariat official, called the attack "an error" and said it was under investigation.</p>
        <p>In Ocosingo, a market town of about 13,000 that was still littered with the bodies of dead guerrillas and stank from their smell, some residents said the attack of the Zapatistas, named for the Mexican revolutionary Emiliano Zapata, had come as less of a surprise to them than to others.</p>
        <p>Rodolfo Ruiz, the town veterinarian, said the state police office a few doors down from his clinic had brought in reinforcements to more than triple its regular contingent of about a dozen officers after word that "there would be an act of aggression by some Indians."</p>
        <p>He and other townspeople said hundreds of rebels who stole into the town just after the New Year battled the police during much of Saturday, killing four of them. They said the others were stripped of their weapons and uniforms and run out of town.</p>
        <p>The rebels took over the local radio station for two days of broadcasts, broke open Government stores and invited townspeople to loot them, and set up quarters in the town market. Up the street, they besieged the home of a family of relatively wealthy ranchers, robbing and ransacking the premises and kidnapping six of them, townspeople said. All but one of the family members, a doctor who is still missing, escaped as army troops advanced on the town on Monday. Shot at Close Range</p>
        <p>At least a dozen rebels had been killed in and around the Ocosingo market. Six were found lying face down, shot at close range in the back of the head, their hands behind them and short lengths of nylon rope beside them. One still had his hands tied.</p>
        <p>A seventh young peasant in rebel uniform had his head partly blown off and a length of the same type of rope knotted around his neck. Some of the dead appeared to have been armed only with fake rifles made of wood, which lay nearby.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cantu said that the Chiapas State government had been ordered to investigate the killings but that its initial information indicated that the men, despite their shabby uniforms and Indian peasant faces, were in fact policemen. But the town's Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Pablo Iribarne, said he had buried all four of the dead policemen.</p>
