        <p>Thomas Schwarz still doesn't get it. Mr. Schwarz, an attorney, was appointed to replace the Rev. Joseph O'Hare as chairman of New York City's Campaign Finance Board in an obvious act of score-settling by David Dinkins on his final working day as Mayor. Mr. Dinkins and his campaign aides were angered when the board fined the Dinkins campaign for exceeding the campaign spending limit in the 1993 mayoral primary.</p>
        <p>For the good of the city, and to preserve the board's integrity and independence, Mr. Schwarz should step aside. Yet he still clings to the job despite calls from the new Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, several major civic groups and two board members asking him to resign.</p>

        <p>Thomas Schwarz still doesn't get it. Mr. Schwarz, an attorney, was appointed to replace the Rev. Joseph O'Hare as chairman of New York City's Campaign Finance Board in an obvious act of score-settling by David Dinkins on his final working day as Mayor. Mr. Dinkins and his campaign aides were angered when the board fined the Dinkins campaign for exceeding the campaign spending limit in the 1993 mayoral primary.</p>
        <p>For the good of the city, and to preserve the board's integrity and independence, Mr. Schwarz should step aside. Yet he still clings to the job despite calls from the new Mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, several major civic groups and two board members asking him to resign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schwarz offers a selfish deal. He would allow Father O'Hare to finish work on the 1993 election on condition that he begin his own chairmanship at a specified time. But the point is that the taint attached to his appointment threatens the nonpartisan nature of the board and, by extension, the city's public financing system. It also means that two of the board's four members now hail from the same law firm, Skadden, Arps. That is an unhealthy concentration of influence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani says he would reappoint Father O'Hare should Mr. Schwarz resign, and that he would consider subjecting the choice of the next chairman to a public screening process. Civic condemnation must continue until Mr. Schwarz leaves.</p>
