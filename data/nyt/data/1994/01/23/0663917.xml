        <p>Before he thought about being a priest, says the Rev. Jerry Jecewicz, pastor of Brooklyn's Holy Spirit Church, he wanted to be a magician. After his ordination 18 years ago, his vocation and avocation were intertwined in the form of 'The Priesto Magic Spectacular," a show that stars Father Jecewicz in priestly collar and top hat. In apparent defiance of the laws of nature, he makes his duck, Dudley, disappear, escapes from a locked trunk and causes a woman to float in midair.</p>
        <p>Every so often, he says, he is contronted by someone who claims that "magic is deception and is therefore an opening for the Devil." But Father Jecewicz insists that he practices "honest" magic -- entertainment, not deception. It is also a boon for his parish, since the money he raises with his show goes to support the Holy Spirit School; since his arrival there in 1991, he has performed at church events throughout New York and earned $25,000 for the school.</p>
