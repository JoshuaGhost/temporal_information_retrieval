        <p>WITH the trial over, the ultimate purpose of the Bobbitts' connubial severance story on television night after night seemed to become clear: It provided an endless test of whether Chuck and Sue and all the other anchor people could keep a straight face and get past the particular circumstance without giggling or stuttering at the letter "p" and ruining, really ruining, their careers.</p>
        <p>This done, one of them cut back gratefully the other night to the endlessly told story that winter, as it should be, is here. A camera was soon zooming in on Skippy, a dog that slipped on the ice and needed veterinary aid and whimpered gorgeously as a suggestion that, hey, pets are human, too. Skippy's eyes were hazel and as intense as Bobby Ray Inman's and Tonya Harding's in some earlier cutaways in television's kaleidoscopic meander.</p>

        <p>WITH the trial over, the ultimate purpose of the Bobbitts' connubial severance story on television night after night seemed to become clear: It provided an endless test of whether Chuck and Sue and all the other anchor people could keep a straight face and get past the particular circumstance without giggling or stuttering at the letter "p" and ruining, really ruining, their careers.</p>
        <p>This done, one of them cut back gratefully the other night to the endlessly told story that winter, as it should be, is here. A camera was soon zooming in on Skippy, a dog that slipped on the ice and needed veterinary aid and whimpered gorgeously as a suggestion that, hey, pets are human, too. Skippy's eyes were hazel and as intense as Bobby Ray Inman's and Tonya Harding's in some earlier cutaways in television's kaleidoscopic meander.</p>
        <p>In this winter, as the cutaways are falling faintly through the universe, faintly falling on the passive couching of the days, at least there is still Arnold Diaz alive and angry and on the prowl from Channel 2 for brazen miscreants whom he literally shames on camera as thieves and con artists and hypocrites caught cheating the innocent of their money and rights. True to form in his "shame on you" reporter's role for WCBS-TV, Arnold is out finding a spin of substance for the weather story. He's gathering material on public school custodians -- those perennially denounced barons of bureaucratic imperiousness -- and complaints that some have been lazy at shoveling the school snows so students have been slipping hard onto the ice, whimpering like Skippy.</p>
        <p>He is currently searching out custodians for bearding, letting them present explanations or excuses, or duck out on him on camera. We can hope for the satisfaction of last year when he confronted a despotic letter carrier in the Bronx and caught him charging poor welfare recipients $5 and $10 for the already tax-paid service of delivering their Government checks. Or the frisson last summer in watching Arnold, all pencil mustache and nasal persistence, lean bravely into the taxi of a nasty-mouthed, tourist-scamming driver caught red-handed as the shame reporter demanded that he rip away the tape masking his meter and pay back his victims.</p>
        <p>Arnold Diaz has won enough in awards and criminal indictments in his 500 reports of the last five years that he doesn't have to glean so intently every morning down the list of 150 calls and 30 letters he gets daily. (Hmm, a waterbug in a can of tuna. And always more for his "shrinking products" epic: this time, a popular candy bar, quietly reduced 10 percent in size while the price and packaging stays the same.) But search he does, uncomplaining when four stakeouts in a row come up empty, certain that mundane larceny will out.</p>
        <p>"I'm salivating from the opportunity to stick it to the bad guy," says Arnold, confessional as his targets rarely are. He smiles at the thought that his work might not amount to much in the long bait-and-switch of life but at least some viewers cynically lulled out there can pop awake for a moment to savor that odd instant of someone not taking it anymore on their behalf. "What I do is the video equivalent of putting people in the stocks, like in the old town squares, so honest people can throw rotten tomatoes at them," says the 44-year-old reporter, pausing in his Supermensch sweeps of the city.</p>
        <p>He catches jewelers short-weighting gold and Medicare administrators blandly paying $7,000 for simple toe bandages for a woman who bothered to call Arnold. He has cornered chimney sweeps who carry loose bricks and dead birds as props for price-gouging scams. He has barged into candy stores with porno tapes next to the kids' comics, tracked priority mail to demonstrate that it is no faster, and found wholesalers distributing children's pencil boxes that included small, dangerous box cutters. "Little kid cut up her mother's chair!" says Arnold, his outrage the same off camera as on.</p>
        <p>He remains unpunched on camera and prefers to capture an image of some scam-minded artist staring bitterly at the viewer rather than a picture of the mike cord being wrapped around the shame reporter's neck. He hopes the custodian story will be as good as his Barneygate. That was a tale about the outrageous ticket scalping for the recent stage show starring Barney the friendly dinosaur.</p>
        <p>"We showed little Frankie who sleeps on Barney sheets, eats from a Barney bowl, is a member of the Barney fan club, unable to get tickets after his Mom waited on line at Radio City for hours," Mr. Diaz summarizes with that merry glare his fans love. Ticket scalping is illegal but done all the time in a city whose politicians constantly find new ways to vow improvement (consult "defining deviancy downward"). Arnold Diaz makes no promises, but he does provide the small glory of respite, zooming in on some of the shameful right here in rip-off city.</p>
