        <p>As President Clinton left Moscow today, reaction to his visit seemed to divide roughly into two camps.</p>
        <p>One group tried to weigh the visit in the categories of old, seeking to revive an era when Soviet-American summit meetings reverberated through the world, moving markets and easing fears. They debated what was the most important result, the tripartite arms agreement with Ukraine, the agreement to buy Russian uranium or the promise to aim nuclear missiles away from one another.</p>
        <p>But however hard they tried, this group found little to build on. Ukraine's agreement to surrender its nuclear missiles is still hostage to a stubborn Parliament, the uranium sales would be spread over 20 years and most other declarations were ultimately just that -- declarations.</p>
        <p>But others -- the people who expected nothing of Mr. Clinton because they had learned not to seek salvation from the West and because nothing had been promised -- these people liked him. Just One of the Guys</p>
        <p>"He's a simpatiaga," said a retired architect after watching Mr. Clinton's "town hall" meeting on television Friday, using a colloquial and affectionate variation on sympathetic. "Russians like simpatiagi."</p>
        <p>"He's a good muzhik," agreed the architect's husband, a retired biologist, using a word for peasant that denotes a regular guy. They had watched the program with their sons and grandchildren, and all were pleased. "He knows how to talk with people," the biologist said. "He didn't need to read off a paper. He answered questions precisely."</p>
        <p>And that, they argued, was what a nation raised on haughty leaders and a habit of blaming all ills on outside machinations needed to see and hear.</p>
        <p>"We've always pinned our ills on someone else -- enemies, conspirators, fascists, the C.I.A.," said the biologist. "Of course we're at fault ourselves, and it was useful to see a young, candid American President openly describing American interests and openly saying that there is a limit to what America can do for us." Change Doesn't Come Cheap</p>
        <p>There were those, to be sure, who betrayed a touch of bitterness over lost illusions about a West just waiting to throw billions of dollars at Russia. It had been a given of the Soviet era that the West would reward the Russians if they ever threw off Communism.</p>
        <p>"It was a visit of a very good and energetic world leader who wants to achieve great effects practically for free," said Yuri D. Chernichenko, a senior deputy in the new upper house, with a discernible touch of sarcasm.</p>
        <p>A similar tone marked an editorial in The New Daily Gazette: "The inspection tour of Bill Clinton to Moscow is coming to an end. Surveying the household of his Russian colleague, and also the Czar Cannon and the Czar Bell, the senior American comrade expressed his full satisfaction about everything and promised to help with food. For this reason, exultation is reigning in Moscow, all are dancing and singing."</p>
        <p>Nobody, of course, was either dancing or singing. With the nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky making a daily mockery of the new parliament, with President Boris N. Yeltsin holding ever greater power and ever less authority, with the ruble again sinking and no sign of improvement anywhere, this was not a time for song and dance. 'Moral Support'</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton did not elicit curses, either. He struck a tone to which Russians seemed to respond: he did not belittle their hardships, he did not promise them mounds of aid, he did not patronize them.</p>
        <p>The free market would not solve all their ills, and democracy, he said, citing Winston Churchill, was "the worst possible form of government, except for all the others."</p>
        <p>But Russia is a great nation, Mr. Clinton said, and therefore the Russians would choose the right path. "After all, Russia did not get to this point by making all that many wrong decisions in the past, and every nation makes a few mistakes," he said.</p>
        <p>Yuri Davydov, of the Center for European Studies, said of Mr. Clinton: "He offered political and moral support for the Government and the society, which is very important. It's important for society to feel that what happens in Russia is important for the world.</p>
        <p>"Clinton came here at a very difficult moment. Democracy is meeting with difficulties, reform is facing difficulties, society is weary. It doesn't trust anyone, and the election of Zhirinovsky is the result of this. In this complex time, it is very important to support those who want to continue reform. Clinton did this very well."</p>
        <p>Russia needed to hear that it was still great, wrote the paper Trud: "One of the main conclusion, and a gratifying one, is that Russia, regardless of all its internal problems, is again taking its place as a great power in the international arena.</p>
        <p>"But now its authority is based not on the power of nuclear missiles, but on the devotion to democratic principles."</p>
