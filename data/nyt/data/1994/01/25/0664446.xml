        <p>The fallout from KARL LAGERFELD's use of a verse from the Koran in his spring couture collection for Chanel continues to spread, despite apologies from the designer and the fashion house.</p>
        <p>Now, Chanel has engaged a bodyguard for CLAUDIA SCHIFFER, the supermodel who paraded down the runway in a low-cut strapless bustier with what Chanel later said were fragments of verses from the Muslim holy book embroidered in gray pearls. According to a report by Reuters, Ms. Schiffer's mother told Bild, a German newspaper, that the model would not set foot on the streets without security because of alleged threats.</p>
        <p>The controversy erupted last week after the couture show in Paris, when the Indonesian Muslim Scholars Council in Jakarta called for a boycott of Chanel and threatened to file formal protests with the Government of Mr. Lagerfeld's homeland, Germany. The designer apologized, explaining that he had taken the design from a book about the Taj Mahal, thinking the words came from a love poem.</p>
        <p>On Friday, CLAUDE ELIETTE, president of Chanel, and Dr. DALIL BOUBAKEUR, rector of the Muslim Institute of the Mosque of Paris, met for two hours. In a joint statement, Mr. Eliette repeated the apologies and Dr. Boubakeur promised to transmit them to Muslims in France and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But that did not end the matter. In a dispatch from Cairo, Reuters reported that the religious affairs committee of the Egyptian Parliament is urging Muslims to boycott Chanel. The committee issued its appeal on Sunday after meeting to consider measures against the fashion house.</p>
        <p>"The act hurt Muslims' feelings worldwide and ridiculed their holy book," AHMED OMAR HASHIM, leader of the committee, said in a statement.</p>
