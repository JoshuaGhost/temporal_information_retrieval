        <p>b-Included a pretax loss of $ 1.1 million on the sale of mutual funds and a $ 1 million charge for legal costs related to an aborted merger agreement with Medco Containment Services for both the quarter and 9 months. During fiscal 1993, the company began to classify as revenue certain drug and medical items supplied to contract pharmacy service customers that had previously netted against cost of sales. Amounts have been reclassified for prior periods and had no impact on earnings. Diagnostek said that its latest 9 months earnings included higher than customary gains on the sales of marketable securities, which offset increased sales and marketing expenses associated mainly with the introduction of its RxChoice and CapRX products.</p>
