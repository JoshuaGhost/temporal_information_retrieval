        <p>The Supreme Court today rejected an airline industry attack on airport landing fees in a ruling that could strengthen the hand of airports seeking to exact more revenue from commercial airline operations.</p>
        <p>The impact of the 7-to-1 decision was limited, however, by the Court's assertion that it would defer in future cases to the Department of Transportation's view of whether a particular airport's fees were "reasonable."

        <p>The Supreme Court today rejected an airline industry attack on airport landing fees in a ruling that could strengthen the hand of airports seeking to exact more revenue from commercial airline operations.</p>
        <p>The impact of the 7-to-1 decision was limited, however, by the Court's assertion that it would defer in future cases to the Department of Transportation's view of whether a particular airport's fees were "reasonable." The Government had not intervened in the particular dispute before the Court, involving the Kent County International Airport near Grand Rapids, Mich., leaving the Justices to make their own determination, with evident reluctance, of the reasonableness of the fees at issue.</p>
        <p>The Department of Transportation "is equipped, as courts are not, to survey the field nationwide and to regulate based on a full view of the relevant facts and circumstances," Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the Court. If the department had reached a "reasoned decision" on whether disputed airport fees were acceptable, "we would accord that decision substantial deference."</p>
        <p>Last month, days after the Justices made it clear during the argument in this case that they wanted more guidance from the department, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena announced that the department would take a more active role and intervene in disputes over landing fees. Deputy Secretary Morton Downey underscored that determination today when he said, in response to the decision, that overseeing the fee structures of the nation's airports was "our responsibility and we intend to fulfill it."</p>
        <p>Earlier in December, the department brokered a truce between the major airlines and the Los Angeles International Airport, which had threatened to bar landings by airlines that did not agree to pay sharply higher fees. That case is now in Federal court, and the airlines are paying the fees in the interim.</p>
        <p>At issue in the dispute before the Court today was a 1973 Federal law, the Anti-Head Tax Act, which bars airports from imposing landing fees or other service charges that are not "reasonable." When the Kent County airport increased the fees it charged commercial airlines in 1987, seven airlines brought suit in Federal court charging that various aspects of the airport's overall fee structure violated the law. Contentions of Suit</p>
        <p>The suit was brought by Northwest Airlines; Simmons Airlines, an AMR Corporation subsidiary based in Chicago; Comair, a Delta Air Lines commuter line; USAir; American Airlines, United Airlines; and Midway Airlines. The airlines lost in the Federal District Court in Grand Rapids and, on most issues, in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>The airlines particularly objected to two aspects of the airport's fees: that the fees taxed commercial airlines disproportionately compared with private users, and that the fee increases were excessive because the airport was already generating a large surplus from its charges to restaurants, car-rental operations and other concessions.</p>
        <p>The Court today rejected both arguments, concluding that the Federal law at issue did not limit an airport's ability to build up a surplus and that the airlines had not proved that the different treatment of commercial and general aviation was discriminatory.</p>
        <p>The Kent County airport has about 150 commercial takeoffs and landings a day. It charges airlines $1.15 for each 1,000 pounds of gross landing weight, or about $600 for a Boeing 747 carrying an average load. The Los Angeles International Airport tripled its landing fees last July to $1.56 per 1,000 pounds. Other landing fees include $3.50 per 1,000 pounds at La Guardia Airport, $2.75 at Kennedy International Airport and $1.77 at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport .</p>
        <p>Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissent in the case, Northwest Airlines v. Kent County, No. 92-97, saying the Court had misinterpreted the law by turning it into "a broad mandate for Federal regulation." Justice Harry A. Blackmun did not take part in the case.</p>
        <p>These were among the other actions on a busy day at the Court: False Arrest</p>
        <p>The Court ruled, 7 to 2, that someone who has been the victim of a false arrest cannot invoke the 14th Amendment's guarantee of due process of law to bring a Federal court suit against the officials who initiated the groundless prosecution.</p>
        <p>There was no majority opinion in the case, Albright v. Oliver, No. 92-833, which upheld a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Four Justices, in a plurality opinion by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, held that the right to be free from being prosecuted without probable cause is protected not by the 14th Amendment but by the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure. Kevin Albright, the man who brought this case after being arrested on an unfounded drug charge in Macomb, Ill., did not base his suit on the Fourth Amemdment.</p>
        <p>The plurality opinion was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor, and Antonin Scalia. Justices Thomas, David H. Souter and Anthony M. Kennedy agreed on different grounds that the case had been properly dismissed. Justices Blackmun and John Paul Stevens dissented. Workers' Rights</p>
        <p>The Court ruled 9 to 0 that an employee who was wrongfully dismissed can still be entitled to reinstatement and back pay under Federal labor law even if he told a lie during investigation of the case.</p>
        <p>In this case, ABF Freight System v. National Labor Relations Board, No. 92-1550, a dockworker had given a false excuse for being late to work and repeated his lie during a Federal investigation into whether he had been wrongfully discharged in retaliation for union activity. The company argued that the lie, although not directly germane to the labor dispute, should make the worker ineligible for reinstatement.</p>
        <p>In an opinion by Justice Stevens, the Court held that there should be no automatic disqualification and that remedies in cases like this should remain within the discretion of the National Labor Relations Board. The decision upheld a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver.</p>
