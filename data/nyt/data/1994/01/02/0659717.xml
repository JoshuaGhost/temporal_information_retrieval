        <p>Recurrent northeasters and dropping temperatures drive striped bass from the New England coast south past New York waters in autumn. In a good year, they will pause in the Bight and provide a period of exceptional fishing into early December, but it is the rare angling foray toward the latter part of the run that doesn't offer strong hints of the impending winter.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, the predawn darkness on a recent day foretold of tolerable conditions ahead -- a hard frost had settled out of the night sky, indicating a chill start, but more importantly, merciful winds.</p>
        <p>I huddled with two friends, Tim Barnard and Dave Taft, in the cabin of Captain Ronnie Lepper's charter boat, Kim. Our strategy was set; Lepper had learned that the previous day had yielded two 50-pound stripers in Raritan Bay, along with numerous but less noteworthy fish.</p>
        <p>However, our westward course from East Rockaway Inlet was interrupted by the irresistible appearance off Breezy Point of the holy trinity of ocean angling -- panicked baitfish near the surface, hungry game fish below them, and flocks of seagulls hovering above, picking off wounded prey while conveniently providing an aerial marker for the exact location of the schools. We knew we arrived late on the scene when we spotted a flattened area in the light chop, the result of a slick that drifted to the surface from the oily residue of slaughtered baitfish below.</p>
        <p>Lepper is a blithe, easygoing man -- except when trying to locate striped bass for his charters, an attitude that has resulted in his having brought more than 50 stripers over 50 pounds to gaff alongside the Kim. When several passes produced only one small bluefish that had the surprising pluck to strike one of the four large bunker spoons we trolled, we dashed off to the flats deep inside Raritan Bay, where a grand fleet had assembled, also trolling bunker spoons.</p>
        <p>Raritan Bay is normally not a prime location for large stripers, but they had been drawn there by the presence of schools of mossbunker, a favorite food. Mossbunker, also known as menhaden, are a large, fatty herring species, and bunker spoons are immense artificial lures that emulate them. Captain Lepper is widely considered the master of modern bunker-spoon fishing.</p>
        <p>To swim correctly and catch fish, these steel slabs must have the correct shape, curvature and placement and weight of the lead keel, and then be towed at the proper speed and depth. Lepper developed the finest spoons to date, but later sold his spoon-making business. His remaining originals are cherished; each one we used was numbered to keep track of its subtle idiosyncrasies and after fishing they were rinsed in fresh water, dried and packed away.</p>
        <p>The incessant CB radio chatter over the bay indicated that the previous day's exceptional fishing was not being repeated, but that a few fish remained. After one hour, the port-side rod bent way over and Taft subdued a husky 12-pound striped bass.</p>
        <p>Taft was struck by the contrast between fighting a striper on heavy trolling tackle and the fly rod he favors. We were using stainless steel line to carry the spoons to the lower depths. Wire line fishing has a lackluster reputation because the line is strong enough to simply overpower most fish. But there is a tradeoff: Because it does not stretch like most fishing line, every pull and shake of a fish's head is telegraphed to the rod, so that fighting a fish has the gritty appeal of a tug-of-war.</p>
        <p>Because no hot leads came over the radio, on the change of tide Captain Lepper relied on experience and moved to the outside of Sandy Hook. The tidal flow toward New York Harbor was too swift for the spoons to wobble correctly, so we switched to an offering that cuts through the current, umbrella rigs.</p>
        <p>These rigs are aptly named -- small tube lures dangle off four umbrella-like wires, and two additional tube lures trail off long leaders. The net effect underwater is a good imitation of a tight school of small baitfish, followed by a couple of laggards.</p>
        <p>We trolled umbrella rigs off two rods and quickly located a pod of schoolie stripers over a small piece of mussel-covered bottom. When the first three fish slammed the black tubes on the port-side rod, ignoring the red tubes on the starboard side, we changed to black tubes on both rods. Soon after, both rods were hit. Taft's bass came up quickly, but Captain Lepper noticed that Barnard's fish was waging a peculiar battle and he correctly predicted that Barnard had two bass on at once.</p>
        <p>The CB radio grapevine soon attracted a variety of private and charter craft, but only those with black tube lures caught striped bass. For the remainder of the afternoon and in between strikes, we relaxed to the drone of the inboard engine and to a bright haze that veiled the not too distant Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, grateful for that rare late autumn combination of good weather and good fishing.
