        <p>In a taste of battles likely to dominate American politics for the next decade, labor unions and spokesmen for the elderly today attacked proposals from a panel advising President Clinton on how to slow the growth of Social Security, Medicare and other Government benefit programs.</p>
        <p>After three hours of debate, the chairman of the panel, Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, admitted that he had only four or five votes of the 20 needed to win an official endorsement of his recommendations. The 32-member panel, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, is scheduled to hold its final meeting on Wednesday, with no consensus in sight.</p>

        <p>In a taste of battles likely to dominate American politics for the next decade, labor unions and spokesmen for the elderly today attacked proposals from a panel advising President Clinton on how to slow the growth of Social Security, Medicare and other Government benefit programs.</p>
        <p>After three hours of debate, the chairman of the panel, Senator Bob Kerrey, Democrat of Nebraska, admitted that he had only four or five votes of the 20 needed to win an official endorsement of his recommendations. The 32-member panel, the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform, is scheduled to hold its final meeting on Wednesday, with no consensus in sight.</p>
        <p>As part of a comprehensive plan to control the cost of Federal benefit programs, Mr. Kerrey and the vice chairman of the commission, Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, proposed raising the eligibility age for Medicare and the normal retirement age, at which full Social Security benefits become available, to 70, from the current 65. They would also reduce Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and certain veterans' benefits for people with high incomes.</p>
        <p>Critics immediately denounced the proposals, just as Mr. Kerrey had predicted. Thomas R. Donahue, secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said, "These measures would destroy the retirement income and health system that Americans have enjoyed for 60 years." He asserted that "there is no crisis in the Social Security retirement program."</p>
        <p>Robert M. Ball, a former Commissioner of Social Security, said that Mr. Kerrey's proposals, taken together, would mean a 44 percent reduction in benefits for workers who have earned average wages over the course of their lives. "Raising the normal retirement age to 70 would reduce benefits not only for early retirees, but also for those who wait until age 70 to retire," Mr. Ball said.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether Senator Kerrey, who expressed impatience with his critics, will engage in the lengthy discussions and negotiations that will be needed to forge agreement within his panel. It is also unclear whether his proposals will improve or worsen the political climate for members of Congress who want to curb the growth of Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>Horace B. Deets, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said he was stunned by Mr. Kerrey's proposals because they would require older people to "bear, not share, the burden of deficit reduction." The proposals, he said, are not balanced; two-thirds of the proposed savings would come from Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>Martin A. Corry, director of Federal affairs at the association, said: "Only a small proportion of workers retire at 65. The average retirement age is now 61 1/2, though some retirees return to the labor force for part-time or seasonal work."</p>
        <p>Workers can now collect Social Security retirement benefits at ages as low as 62, but the benefits for early retirees are reduced, and the reduction is larger for people who retire earlier.</p>
        <p>Thomas R. Margenau, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said: "Fifty-one percent of the people who apply for Social Security retirement benefits do so at the age of 62. Only 25 percent wait till age 65."</p>
        <p>Richard L. Trumka, a commission member who is also president of the United Mine Workers of America, said Mr. Kerrey seemed to be operating on the premise that "we must destroy these programs in order to save them."</p>
        <p>"The means-testing of Medicare would, in effect, redefine it as welfare," Mr. Trumka said. "And we all know the level of public support for welfare programs."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerrey said such hostile reactions suggested that Americans could not deal with serious problems until they turned into a crisis.</p>
        <p>Several commission members expressed support for Mr. Kerrey's approach. Among them were Robert E. Denham, the chairman of Salomon Inc.; Peter G. Peterson, chairman of the Blackstone Group, an investment bank, and two Republican Representatives, C. Christopher Cox of California and J. Alex McMillan of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>Some members of the commission said they needed more time to analyze and discuss Mr. Kerrey's proposals, so they would understand how the changes affected people at different income levels.</p>
        <p>One commission member, Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, said the critics of Mr. Kerrey's plan were trying to whip up "raw political fear" by using inflammatory words like "cut, slash, chop, destroy and dismantle." In fact, he said, people over the age of 50 will not be much affected.</p>
        <p>Wade J. Henderson, director of the Washington office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said the proposals would have disproportionate effects on blacks and "could exacerbate racial divisions." For black males born in 1992, he said, the life expectancy is 65 years, so many of them will not live long enough to receive Social Security benefits if the retirement age is increased to 70.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Kerrey's proposals would reduce the Social Security payroll tax for employees. Workers would have to invest the extra money they received in private savings plans or individual retirement accounts.</p>
        <p>Asked whether this was a first step toward "privatizing Social Security," Mr. Kerrey said: "Yes. But private retirement benefits are not destructive of Social Security."</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Kerrey's proposal, elderly people could stay in Medicare, but they could also get Government vouchers to enroll in private health plans. In addition, he would limit the tax deductions that employers may take for the cost of employee health benefits. Under current law, there is no such limit.</p>
