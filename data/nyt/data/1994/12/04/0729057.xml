        <p>THE brittle old blueprint, kept since 1910, identifies the huge stone lodge on Lake Quonnipaug as Goat Hill Camp; the profile of a large goat's head, with water spouting from its mouth, is carefully drawn, the centerpiece of a fountain on the north side of the house.</p>

        <p>THE brittle old blueprint, kept since 1910, identifies the huge stone lodge on Lake Quonnipaug as Goat Hill Camp; the profile of a large goat's head, with water spouting from its mouth, is carefully drawn, the centerpiece of a fountain on the north side of the house.</p>
        <p>Goats can become an obsession here. Starting with the three-dimensional goat's head protruding from granite columns at the entrance, the next goat spotted is either the iron silhouette atop the garage, or part of the wildly Art Nouveau bronze plaque on one of the heavy, arch-topped entrance doors.</p>
        <p>Inside, large copper fireplace hoods announce the name of the place, with homilies to the good life of hunting and fishing. The lodge's original owner, Robert R. Kintz, was its architect, with Joseph Testori listed on the blueprint as the stone mason. In the 40's, after the ailing Mr. Kintz married his nurse, the stone lodge was called Kintz Garden after she opened a downstairs gift shop with that name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kintz willed the lodge to the nearby Our Lady of Grace monastery, reportedly as a way to insure that his wife would be well cared for. The Dominican nuns never used the home, and subsequently received permission to sell, according to the new owners.</p>
        <p>"There was still some clause in the deed that gave the nuns the right to take possession of the house anytime they wanted," said John Romanik, who bought the house on Aug. 3 for $375,000. "We had that taken out -- I didn't want the cloistered nuns moving in with us."</p>
        <p>Mr. Romanik, 52, and his wife, Mary, 48, both love the house, but each has a strong will, and their wills diverge on how the house should be restored.</p>
        <p>To the impartial observer, the house looks fine: there are no obvious areas of neglect, and the Romaniks have decorated it with style: there are two full suits of armor at different corners in the 12-by-20-foot living room, along with an 8-foot-long banquet table and big chairs in the corner where the largest glass windows meet to create the house's best lake view.</p>
        <p>But to the Romaniks, the 10-room house still needs a complete overhaul; they both agree it needs all new windows and some French doors and that the master bath, with its four-foot white tub -- "What was that for, pygmies?" asked Mrs. Romanik -- has to go. But Mr. Romanik thinks a lot more should be saved than Mrs. Romanik.</p>
        <p>HE pointed to a 4- by 4-inch spot where a piece of stone is missing from the corner of one of the fireplace mantels. "I think that missing piece is acceptable because its 80 or 90 years old," he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Romanik laughed. "No," she said, "you've got to fix it."</p>
        <p>Upstairs, in the guest bathroom, Mr. Romanik said he thought that 70's bathroom fixtures could remain.</p>
        <p>"You must be kidding," Mrs. Romanik said.</p>
        <p>But the changes have been delayed for now because the Romaniks have another problem -- their business almost burned to the ground a couple of weeks ago.</p>
        <p>"We were all set to let the carpenters loose on this place," Mr. Romanik said, "but then the farm burned down." The farm is the Bishop Farm and Winery, a huge orchard, vineyard and Christmas shop about 20 minutes away in Cheshire, Conn.</p>
        <p>"It was a landmark," Mr. Romanik said. "We had gutted it and rebuilt it; built an ice cream parlor and baked our own pies. We'd just finished the Christmas shop.</p>
        <p>"We'd just opened it in June," Mrs. Romanik continued, adding that no one knows how the Nov. 15 fire started. "One of the employees had been cleaning a sleigh with linseed oil, which is highly flammable and we can't find the rags," said Mr. Romanik, nevertheless adding that the cleaning site was far away from where the fire started -- in a wastepaper basket at 4:30 A.M. -- making that hypothesis unlikely.</p>
        <p>The Romaniks said they were insured for both physical damage and loss of business revenues, "but it sure is disheartening after all that work," she said. The fire destroyed the farm's showroom and Christmas shop.</p>
        <p>"We thought the guys would come in and start here -- the house -- around Jan. 1 and work until spring," Mr. Romanik said. "They were supposed to paint and replace the windows; now we have to do Bishop's -- again -- so we'll have to put this place on hold."</p>
        <p>Because of the busy first summer at Bishop's, the Romaniks didn't get to spend enough time at the lodge. Standing in the kitchen, which the past owner had completely and expensively remodeled, with granite counters and top-of-the-line white appliances and cherry cabinets, the Romaniks conceded that they had yet to cook a meal there.</p>
        <p>"With the hayrides this fall -- we were open seven days a week -- we didn't have a lot of time to come out here," Mr. Romanik said. "We figured next summer, but now, I don't know."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Romanik added, "The forces are working against you."</p>
        <p>Mr. Romanik said he remembered Goat Hill Camp from 35 years ago, when he was friendly with the caretaker for Henry Benevento, who owned the house at the time. It was nicknamed the Christmas House because of the thousands of lights Mr. Benevento would hang on all the evergreens, which were visible from Route 77 across the lake, at Christmastime. Inside, Mr. Benevento would have a Christmas tree in every room -- and four in the living room. "We used to come over here fishing and playing cards," Mr. Romanik said.</p>
        <p>WHEN the Romaniks, who have restored a series of old houses, were looking for their next house, they looked on Long Island Sound. "But there were problems with insurance," Mr. Romanik explained, referring to the difficulty finding coverage for houses on tidal waters because of storms and flooding.</p>
        <p>"We came down here and saw the sign," he said. "We bought it two days later."</p>
        <p>The price, originally $450,000, had been lowered to $375,000, according to Jeanne Thomson of Page-Taft Real Estate in Guilford. One of the sellers is a national sales manager for an Atlanta company who had been transferred to the home office. "Her husband didn't want to sell but they had no choice," Mr. Romanik said.</p>
        <p>"This place is different, it's unique," he concluded. "My wife isn't one for the old-fashioned stuff, but I'm partial to it. Structurally, the place is a fortress -- and I'm an eccentric kind of guy so I appreciate it."</p>
