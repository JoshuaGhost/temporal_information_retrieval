        <p>As the quest for the perfect thematic programming leads musicians to find increasingly obscure connections between works and composers, certain more obvious and musically workable connections are being overlooked. Andrew Davis revived one of them on Wednesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, when he led the New York Philharmonic in a program that showed the kinship between Russian and French music. The musical accents are distinct, yet because Russian composers tended to look toward France rather than Germany for models, the music often shows traces of a French sensibility, particularly in matters of coloration and lyricism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis showed that this influence was not a one-way street. The exoticism that drives Borodin's "Polovtsian Dances" is mirrored in a more sophisticated way in Ravel's "Bolero," composed about half a century later. Borodin's vision was of a mythical tribe of nomads in ancient Russia and Ravel's model was essentially Spanish and contemporary, yet both rely heavily on modal, Eastern-tinged melodies.</p>

        <p>As the quest for the perfect thematic programming leads musicians to find increasingly obscure connections between works and composers, certain more obvious and musically workable connections are being overlooked. Andrew Davis revived one of them on Wednesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall, when he led the New York Philharmonic in a program that showed the kinship between Russian and French music. The musical accents are distinct, yet because Russian composers tended to look toward France rather than Germany for models, the music often shows traces of a French sensibility, particularly in matters of coloration and lyricism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis showed that this influence was not a one-way street. The exoticism that drives Borodin's "Polovtsian Dances" is mirrored in a more sophisticated way in Ravel's "Bolero," composed about half a century later. Borodin's vision was of a mythical tribe of nomads in ancient Russia and Ravel's model was essentially Spanish and contemporary, yet both rely heavily on modal, Eastern-tinged melodies.</p>
        <p>Those works opened and closed Mr. Davis's program. Between them he offered the Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto and Ravel's "Tombeau de Couperin." It was a program that invited considerable expressive leeway as well as a showy virtuosity. But Mr. Davis rarely exercised his options to their full extent. His Borodin was briskly paced, solid and respectable, and the Philharmonic players delivered the music nearly spotlessly. Yet it was not until the work's final moments that the performance began to catch fire.</p>
        <p>The Rachmaninoff was also curiously earthbound. All the big tunes were there, and when they appeared in the strings and winds, Mr. Davis brought them forth in large enough strokes. And Andrei Gavrilov, in his best moments, captured some of the gracefulness and lyricism of the solo piano line. But he never made the line sing as it must, and there were moments, particularly in the grandly scaled first movement, when his playing was tentative and inaccurate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis had a better time with the two Ravel works. His clear textures and vital rhythms did full justice to the "Tombeau," which showed off the considerable polish and sensitivity of the Philharmonic's winds and the silvery sheen of its strings. And in an account of the "Bolero" in which some of Ravel's more strident effects were harmlessly exaggerated, Mr. Davis drew a brilliant, high-energy sound from the orchestra.  MUSIC REVIEW</p>
