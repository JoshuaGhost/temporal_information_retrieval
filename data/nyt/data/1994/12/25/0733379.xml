        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"They're in a Position to Mix Metaphors with Business" (Nov. 27) deals with the recognition of poetry by the world of business, and its importance in the personal lives of many businessmen, a presence too long unheralded. James Barr, as the new president of the Poetry Society of America, can make a major contribution to both worlds.</p>
        <p>Good poets make good language, but it should be clearly understood that the language of poetry is artificial and what the language of the marketplace needs is clarity, not layers of meaning. I would love to read a financial statement or prospectus written so ordinary folks could understand it. Maybe Mr. Barr can help.</p>
        <p>As for the role of businessmen-poets, a bit of research would come up with many names. Mukul Pandya mentioned a few of them in his article. I remember Donald Axinn quite well. We were both members of the Long Island Poetry Collective.</p>
        <p>Others who come quite readily to mind include Frank Crohn, the chief executive of a major life insurance company, who served with me on the board of the poetry magazine The New York Quarterly, and John Guenther, who was associated with a prominent Wall Street public relations firm.</p>
        <p>As a retired certified public accountant, dealing with the vicissitudes of business for more than 50 years, your article evoked fond memories of how my professional career was enriched by my growth as a poet. My clients could not believe that their C.P.A., an otherwise "solid citizen," learned in the nuance of numbers, could create some rather creditable poetry.</p>
        <p>Perhaps William Packard, editor of The New York Quarterly, put it best in a forward to a book of my poems. "Greeks called poetry numbers . . . classical poetry was thus clearly akin to mathematics," he wrote. Business, of course, is defined by numbers. This kind of relationship was also recognized in another forward to my book, written by Milton Asnis, a consultant on language and communication for that epitome of business, I.B.M. Obviously, the value of words in business did not go unnoticed at Big Blue.</p>
        <p>So Good Heavens, do not overlook the C.P.A.'s.</p>
        <p>By the way, one of my most circulated poems was entitled "Why Some C.P.A.'s Write Poetry," a versification of one of the more dreadful, baffling passages from the Federal Income Tax Code. HERBERT J. WAXMAN  Coconut Creek, Fla., Dec. 6</p>
