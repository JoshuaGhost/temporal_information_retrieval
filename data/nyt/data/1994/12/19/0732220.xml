        <p>Boxes were packed, the desk was bare, and the Rayburn House Office Building was no longer home to Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas.</p>
        <p>Along with Congressional aides, press officers, staff assistants, secretaries and elevator operators, Mr. Glickman was joining the ranks of the 3,600 Capitol Hill workers left unemployed by the demise of the Democratic majority. Even worse, so was his wife, Rhoda, who for the last 13 years has headed one of the 28 Congressional caucuses whose financing the new Republican-controlled Congress plans to eliminate.</p>
        <p>One recent day, the Glickmans sat among packing crates in his cream-colored office, eating shoestring potatoes from a can and reminiscing about the election, their 18 years in Washington and what they would miss. And although they said they had no immediate money worries, they wondered about their future.</p>
        <p>"I was a little more prepared than some folks because I had worked for the White House Committee on the Family during the Carter Administration, and when he lost I had six months of depression," said Mrs. Glickman. " But this is Washington. This is part of the life." Until the election, Mrs. Glickman had headed the Congressional Arts Caucus.</p>
        <p>Joking about the Capitol's notorious reputation for abandoning those out of power, Mr. Glickman said, "The only one working in the family now is our son, and he won't take our calls."</p>
        <p>But in truth, Mrs. Glickman said, she and her husband had been spared that humiliation. "We were overwhelmed by the number of people who called," she said. "Everyone says that once you lose, the phone calls stop. But they haven't."</p>
        <p>Before last month's election, when the balance of power shifted further than most people had expected, Mr. Glickman -- who was well liked back home in Wichita -- had expected to be re-elected to a 10th term in Kansas's Fourth Congressional District. On a coffee table cluttered with items to be shipped or discarded sat a letter from a constituent saying that it was not Mr. Glickman, but the anti-Democratic, anti-Washington tide that had swept him away.</p>
        <p>"The race was not on the radar screen," said Mr. Glickman, who lost to Todd Tiahrt, a Republican who ran a grass-roots campaign fueled by evangelical and Catholic conservatives. "I thought I had very little chance of losing until a couple of weeks before the election."</p>
        <p>Mr. Glickman is losing more than just the office, the perquisites, the ability to deliver services to constituents and the salary. As the departing chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he is also losing his access to the most sensitive of secrets -- the inside information on Russia and North Korea, the Central Intelligence Agency's most highly classified papers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glickman also said he felt that his last two years had been his most productive for his district. For example, he won passage of a bill that limited manufacturers' liability for older planes, freeing companies from the threat of many costly lawsuits. In Wichita, an airplane plant reopened, with the promise of 2,000 new jobs.</p>
        <p>But in the end, that did not make enough of a difference. "I honestly believe that in people's minds, I had become identified with Congress, even though I hadn't fallen victim to the royalty," he said. "I liken it to a bear market; sometimes the good stocks got hit every bit as much as the bad stocks. In this case, I think I was a good stock."</p>
        <p>Since Nov. 8, the Glickmans have spent evenings dining with other displaced Democrats, commiserating and replaying various campaign scenarios.</p>
        <p>"You spend a lot of time talking about the race," said Mrs. Glickman. Completing his wife's thought, Mr. Glickman added: "Thinking to yourself, if so-and-so had been my campaign manager, would this have happened? And interviewing for jobs."</p>
        <p>For now, the Glickmans have not decided whether to leave Washington. She said she was interested in finding a job that affected social policy. Although Mr. Glickman mentioned several options, he is reportedly being courted by law firms here who see his pro-business stance as a plus.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Glickman is among those being considered to replace Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Still, Mr. Glickman said he would miss being a Congressman.</p>
        <p>"I'll miss being recognized and being fawned over," he joked. "Now the only unrequited love I'll have is from my beagle."</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Glickman's touch of humor, a wistful note crept into his voice as he fingered his tie tack shaped like a sunflower, the state flower of Kansas.</p>
        <p>"I came in with the class of '76, with Al Gore and Panetta and Gephardt," he said. "The class that's running the country. These are my contemporaries. Everybody gives their eyeteeth for this job.</p>
        <p>"And this office," Mr. Glickman said. "I'll miss this office. And the mail. I just love opening the mail. I'd come in on the weekend just to open the mail."</p>
