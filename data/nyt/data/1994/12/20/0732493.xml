        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to "We've Educated Sex to Death" (Op-Ed, Dec. 13) by Kay S. Hymowitz, I would like to point out that ignorance does not equal passion, nor does it equal love.</p>
        <p>I was raised by grandparents who did not talk to me about sex, and there was no sex education in my school. I can attest to the fact that not having the knowledge to make correct sexual decisions is an incredible hardship on a young person and led in my case to a near-rape.</p>
        <p>The simple ability to be able to engage in a sexual dialogue with a partner without shame would have made my early sexual encounters more meaningful. Ms. Hymowitz apparently believes that it is sexier to grope in the dark than to possess basic sexual knowledge.</p>
        <p>But sex is not something that should be learned by trial and error, particularly in the face of escalating teen-age pregnancies and AIDS. It is imperative that we drop our Victorian values, demystify sex and empower our youth with the ability to make educated decisions about their sex lives. FRANCESCA PASTINE San Francisco, Dec. 14, 1994</p>
