        <p>It will take more than a return home to fix what's wrong with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>New York (12-9) is off to its slowest start in Pat Riley's four seasons as coach, and the team has multiple problems to address heading into tonight's game against the Nets at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' lack of size in the backcourt and Hubert Davis's soft defense have been exposed so badly that Riley was considering changes in the rotation.</p>
        <p>Charles Oakley, the team's leading rebounder and best low-post defender, has missed the last three games with a dislocated toe that may require surgery. Oakley was to be re-examined last night, and his status was expected to be known today.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, both John Starks and Davis have been shooting erratically and have been outplayed regularly. Following Sunday's 111-87 drubbing by the Portland Trail Blazers, the Knicks' emotions ranged from concern to surprise to anger.</p>
        <p>"I just think we're getting outplayed, outcoached, outeverythinged," Riley said after the Knicks suffered their second consecutive loss by more than 20 points, and their third defeat in the last four games. "I'm going to sit down and think about it. Obviously, we're getting hurt on a regular basis with guards posting up. We're going to have to so something with that."</p>
        <p>Riley was not specific about what changes he might make, but for now, the Knicks can only get more size in the backcourt by moving a forward to shooting guard in certain situations. New York's biggest guard, the 6-foot-6-inch Doug Christie, is still on the injured list and is not expected to be activated for at least another week. In the meantime, when confronted with a big shooting guard, Riley may start using an unconventional lineup and put either Anthony Bonner (6-8), Anthony Mason (6-7), Monty Williams (6-8) or Charles Smith (6-10) in the backcourt.</p>
        <p>Those are drastic moves, which Riley does not want to make. But it may be time, and perhaps Riley should have made at least one move sooner.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' defense has slipped dramatically, allowing 100.6 points per game, compared to 91.5 points last season. The word is spreading around the league that the Knicks can be attacked by isolating their shooting guards one-on-one. And the enforcement against hand-checking and illegal defenses prevents the Knicks from playing more physically and rotating quickly defensively.</p>
        <p>"I'm always late to change," Riley said. "I don't like to make drastic, radical changes until something really becomes so obvious."</p>
        <p>But it is obvious that the Knicks have been punished by big guards all season, and Sunday may have been the most blatant example. Davis was posted up at will by Clyde Drexler, who scored a game-high 33 points. After Starks was forced to leave the game with two quick fouls, the Trail Blazers went right at Davis. During one first-half sequence, 11 consecutive Portland points were scored by whomever Davis was defending, 9 of them by Drexler. By the time Starks returned, Drexler was already in a groove, and he never lost it.</p>
        <p>Giving up points so easily and losing by such wide margins has affected the Knicks' poise. After Sunday's game, Patrick Ewing accused the Knicks of "moaning and crying" too much, including himself. Ewing was not specific about what he meant, but judging from the facial expressions and body language of the Knicks during Sunday's game, they have lost some of the resiliency that has characterized them in recent years.</p>
        <p>"For some reason, we're dead in the water when teams get up on us," said Starks, who shot 3 of 12 against Portland. "We're giving up. You can't do that."</p>
        <p>When told of Ewing's concerns about the team's poise, Mason felt that it was only natural that the team was showing displeasure under the circumstances.</p>
        <p>"If there's anybody running around smiling and happy about the way we're playing, something's wrong," Mason said. "It's pride. If we start losing, and I look around and nobody's bothered, then I don't want to be here, plain and simple. We're not playing well. People better be upset about it."</p>
        <p>It will be interesting to see how the Knicks react tonight when they face the Nets (10-15) for the first time this season. Both teams will be shorthanded. The Nets will play without All-Star forward Derrick Coleman, who needed 12 stitches to close a gash between the ring and pinky fingers on his left (shooting) hand, after slicing it on the rim during Sunday's 103-102 victory over the Miami Heat. Bonner missed the Portland game because of a serious stroke suffered by his father and it was uncertain whether he would return from St. Louis in time.</p>
        <p>After playing the Nets, the Knicks will be hosts to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday night. Already trailing the Orlando Magic by fourand a half games in their division, being short-handed and playing shaky basketball, the Knicks needed victories -- badly.</p>
        <p>"We're going to have to make adjustments," Smith said. "I know it's coming. Whatever the adjustments are, be it tough, be it easy, guys are going to have to accept it. I'm concerned. I'd rather be concerned now then wait until later and say, 'Now we're concerned.' It's time to get this thing rolling." REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Fans attending tonight's game are asked to bring one or more unwrapped toys to the Garden lobby. Marine Corps personnel will collect the toys, which will be distributed to needy youngsters as part of the Toys for Tots program.  BASKETBALL</p>
