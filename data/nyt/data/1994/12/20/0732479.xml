        <p>After weeks of public criticism aimed at getting New York City's Schools Chancellor to leave town, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani now says that Ramon Cortines should get a one-year extension on a contract that expires next June 30. The Board of Education will offer Mr. Cortines a new contract this week that runs for at least another two years. For the good of the school system, he should stay and Mr. Giuliani should endorse the board's two-year extension.</p>
        <p>The essence of Mayor Giuliani's criticism is that Mr. Cortines has failed to squeeze more fat out of the board's bureaucracy. The Mayor's attacks, particularly in recent days, left him increasingly isolated as parents and civic and business leaders rallied around Mr. Cortines.</p>

        <p>After weeks of public criticism aimed at getting New York City's Schools Chancellor to leave town, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani now says that Ramon Cortines should get a one-year extension on a contract that expires next June 30. The Board of Education will offer Mr. Cortines a new contract this week that runs for at least another two years. For the good of the school system, he should stay and Mr. Giuliani should endorse the board's two-year extension.</p>
        <p>The essence of Mayor Giuliani's criticism is that Mr. Cortines has failed to squeeze more fat out of the board's bureaucracy. The Mayor's attacks, particularly in recent days, left him increasingly isolated as parents and civic and business leaders rallied around Mr. Cortines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has forcefully and rightly taken on many entrenched interests in an effort to cope with budgetary problems. But he has been particularly tough in his treatment of Mr. Cortines.</p>
        <p>At the center of this struggle lie issues of power and control. Like many mayors before him, Mr. Giuliani wants greater influence over a powerful semi-independent agency that accounts for 25 percent of the city's budget. That is why Mr. Giuliani is still trying to set conditions, even though he accepts the reality of his situation: he does not control the board, and the board wants Mr. Cortines to stay.</p>
        <p>The Mayor's main condition was that Mr. Cortines be given only a one-year extension. Though he may now have to swallow two years, Mr. Giuliani nevertheless wants assurances that the Schools Chancellor will ask the city's 1,100 schools to develop their own budgets, rather than accept fiscal mandates from central headquarters; that he will try to adjust disproportionately high spending on special education; that he will adopt an accounting system clarifying the distinctions between administrative and other school costs and, finally, that he will make further reductions in middle management.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani's diagnosis of the system's ills is largely correct. The Chancellor has made progress on some of the issues the Mayor raises, but on others he is not moving fast enough.</p>
        <p>But it is the board's role to decide on the Chancellor's tenure, now and in the future. Five of the seven members have rightly announced their intention to offer him the two-year extension. Mr. Cortines arrived on the scene in 1993; if he decides to stay on until 1997, he will have a total of four years to turn the schools around -- the same amount of time the voters gave Mr. Giuliani to turn the city around.</p>
