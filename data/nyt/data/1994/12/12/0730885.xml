        <p>Analytic Clarity Contrasts With the Magic of a Blend  Tallis Scholars Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>Hearing the magnificent Tallis Scholars in dry, compact acoustics like Tully Hall's is very different from hearing them in a church. And in the sacred repertory by Lassus and some of his contemporaries that they sang on Thursday evening, the experience was far less satisfying.</p>
        <p>True, the analytical clarity worked a fascination of its own, as superbly wrought contrapuntal lines asserted themselves in all their remarkable independence and individuality. And as usual, Peter Phillips's spirited direction kept the singers (up to nine in the various deployments) in excellent balance.</p>
        <p>But the long, relatively plain lines of a work like Lassus's "Missa Osculetur Me," the centerpiece here, unlike the typically more active ones of his madrigals, were written to accommodate and, indeed, capitalize on the reverberant acoustics of a large church. The magic is in the blend, as serene, sinuous melodies intertwine, resonate and blur.</p>
        <p>The focus on Lassus was part of the Tallis Scholars' commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the composer's death. (The group had done likewise for Palestrina the night before at the Church of the Blessed Sacrament, a few blocks north.) The lovely program also included normal Tallis fare appropriate to the season, works by Palestrina and Victoria, Robert Fayrfax and Luca Marenzio, as well as a toe dipped into the early Baroque, with Sweelinck's "Hodie Christus Natus Est."
