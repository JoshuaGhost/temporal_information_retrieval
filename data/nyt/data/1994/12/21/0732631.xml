        <p>THIS is the season for leftover turkey or ham, either of which is perfect in risotto, accompanied by an orange-and-fennel salad dressed with tahini, orange juice and balsamic vinegar. Turkey or Ham Risotto</p>
        <p>3 ounces whole onion or 2 ounces chopped ready-cut onion ( 1/2 cup)  3teaspoons olive oil  4 to 5 cups chicken stock or broth  8 ounces whole red pepper or 7 ounces chopped ready-cut pepper (1 1/2 cups)  1 cup arborio rice</p>
        <p>1 cup dry white wine  4 ounces ripe fresh tomato or 4 ounces crushed canned no-salt-added tomatoes  1 large clove garlic  Cooked white turkey meat or ham, to yield 2 cups julienned  1/3 cup Marsala wine  1 ounce Parmigiano Reggiano ( 1/3 cup coarsely grated).</p>
        <p>1. Chop whole onion.</p>
        <p>2. Heat a nonstick pot until very hot. Reduce heat to medium-high; add 2 teaspoons of the oil; saute onion until it begins to brown.</p>
        <p>3. Heat the chicken stock in a separate pot until hot but not boiling.</p>
        <p>4. Wash, trim, seed and julienne whole pepper.</p>
        <p>5. Heat a small nonstick pan until it is very hot. Reduce heat to medium-high and add remaining oil. Saute pepper until it begins to soften.</p>
        <p>6. When onion begins to brown, stir in the rice to coat, and add the white wine; allow wine to cook away.</p>
        <p>7. Wash, trim and chop tomato fine; mince the garlic. Add both to the pepper.</p>
        <p>8. Add about 1 cup of simmering stock to rice, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often until liquid is absorbed. Repeat the procedure, 1 cup of broth at a time.</p>
        <p>9. In between adding the broth to the rice, julienne the turkey or ham and add to the pepper-tomato mixture with the Marsala. Cook to reduce the Marsala by half.</p>
        <p>10. Grate the cheese.</p>
        <p>11. When the rice is almost tender, add another cup of stock along with the turkey or ham mixture, and cook until most of the broth is absorbed. Stir in the cheese.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving (with turkey): 820 calories, 20 grams fat, 125 milligrams cholesterol, 395 milligrams sodium, 65 grams protein, 90 grams carbohydrate.</p>
