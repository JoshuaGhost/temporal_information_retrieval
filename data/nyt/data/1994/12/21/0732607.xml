        <p>The Knicks lost again, this time to the short-handed Nets, who were without Derrick Coleman. John Starks lost his composure afterward. And New York will be losing Charles Oakley for an extended period because of toe surgery unless his condition improves within a week.</p>
        <p>Hitting the low point of their season, the Knicks were beaten, 85-83, by the Nets last night at Madison Square Garden in a game that featured bizarre events even after the final buzzer.</p>
        <p>According to several observers in the locker-room tunnel, Starks had to be physically restrained by Patrick Ewing and other teammates as Starks screamed at Referee Mike Mathis as he walked to the officials' locker room after the game. Starks felt he had been fouled on a drive with about 10 seconds to play, with New York trailing, 83-82. But Mathis failed to make the call, capping another frustrating evening for Starks, who shot just 4 for 16, including 1 for 7 from 3-point range.</p>
        <p>Starks did not deny that the incident occurred and said he wanted to hear from Mathis why no call was made.</p>
        <p>"It was terrible," said Starks, who missed four shots during the final 2 minutes 15 seconds. "I got fouled and the call wasn't made. That's terrible. You can't go to the hole any harder than that."</p>
        <p>Asked what his intentions were, Starks said: "I wanted to see what was up. I wanted to know why I didn't get the call. The call wasn't made, and it needed to be."</p>
        <p>Asked whether he felt Mathis had something personal against him, Starks said: "I don't know. You'll have to ask him."</p>
        <p>It was the latest evidence that the Knicks have serious problems in a season that has become increasingly frustrating, for Starks and for the Knicks (12-10). They have lost three consecutive games and four of their last five. Meanwhile, it was a satisfying victory for the Nets, who played without Coleman (cut left hand) and shooting guard Kevin Edwards (Achilles' tendon), and who also lost starting center Benoit Benjamin, who was ejected in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Oakley, who missed his fourth consecutive game, said he will have surgery soon if his dislocated toe does not improve. He will try a new insert in his sneaker at practice today, hoping it will alleviate the pain in a final effort to avoid surgery.</p>
        <p>The Knicks squandered chances all evening, and Patrick Ewing made the biggest blunder, missing a potential game-tying foul shot with seven seconds to play and New York trailing, 84-83. Ewing was fouled by Chris Morris while attempting a driving layup, but after calmly making the first free throw, Ewing missed the second.</p>
        <p>'It felt good, it looked good, but it was bad," said Ewing, who finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Then, after Starks missed the tip-in of Ewing's miss, Anthony Mason knocked the rebound out of bounds. Armon Gilliam, who led the Nets with 22 points, was fouled with 4.1 seconds to play, and after Gilliam made just one of two free throws, the Knicks still had a chance.</p>
        <p>With New York out of timeouts, Hubert Davis rushed the ball upcourt and tried to pass to Starks for a 3-pointer. The pass was deflected. Davis recovered, but running out of time, Davis missed a wild one-hand leaning shot at the buzzer. The Nets left the court celebrating. The Knicks were stunned.</p>
        <p>"Just a tough, tough loss, any way you look at it and evaluate the thing," said Pat Riley, who is having his toughest start in four seasons as the Knicks coach. "We had our chances. We didn't make the plays. When you start going bad in this league, bizarre things start to happen. You can't even get a break. You go hard to the basket and draw a foul and don't get the breaks. The thing that we have to do is continue to show more than ever the ability to hang tough."</p>
        <p>But it was the Nets who hung tough in this game, overcoming a 6-point deficit with 4 minutes to play. Kenny Anderson passed out 13 assists, and the Nets made the big plays when they had to. The loss wasted a season-high 17-point performance by Greg Anthony. Anthony Bonner missed the game because of the death of his father in St. Louis.</p>
        <p>"This was big for us, but it won't mean anything if we don't keep it up," said Anderson.</p>
        <p>The controversial play that set off Starks's explosive temper started with 20.2 seconds to play. Starks drove to the basket past Morris and was confronted by Jayson Williams. There was an obvious collision, and either a block or a charge could have been called. But nothing was called. Starks missed wildly, and Morris was fouled by Ewing after the rebound with 9.7 seconds to play. When Morris missed the first free throw and made the second, the Knicks had a chance to tie, but Ewing blew it.</p>
        <p>'This is a game we easily should have won," Ewing said. "We're a better team than the Nets."</p>
        <p>They were not better in this game. Trailing, 82-81, with 43 seconds to play, the Nets took the lead on a broken play after a timeout. Anderson was isolated one on one against Derek Harper about 24 feet from the basket, but as Anderson made his move, he dribbled the ball off the back of his foot, and the ball rolled toward midcourt.</p>
        <p>Anderson chased down the loose ball, then with about 5 seconds left on the 24-second clock, Anderson whipped a pass to Gilliam, who was alone in on the left baseline from about 12 feet away. Gilliam made the jumper, putting the Nets ahead, 83-82, with 20.5 seconds left.</p>
        <p>The Knicks could not even take advantage when Benjamin was ejected with 3:42 left in the first half after he got in a brief shoving match with Ewing. After the two centers exchanged elbows, Ewing shoved Benjamin in the back. Benjamin turned and screamed at Ewing, and both players were given technical fouls. But since Benjamin already had one technical, it was time for a shower. It didn't matter because the Nets won, anyway.</p>
        <p>"He can dish it out, but he can't take it," Benjamin said of his confrontation with Ewing.</p>
        <p>One thing was certain. The Knicks cannot take many more nights like this. REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>DOUG CHRISTIE said he was almost ready to be activated. The Knicks' backup shooting guard, recovering from ankle surgery, has not played this season. . . . Fans attending the Knicks game against the Cleveland Cavaliers tomorrow night at Madison Square Garden are asked to bring cans of nonperishable, nutritious food to the Garden lobby before the game. Salvation Army volunteers will collect the food, to be distributed to the needy during the holiday season.  BASKETBALL</p>
