        <p>Expecting a decrease in financing over the next few years, Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, is recruiting volunteers to deliver social services to the poor.</p>
        <p>Thomas A. DeStefano, executive director of the agency, said it is relying more heavily on a network of 1,600 volunteers, saving money that would otherwise be spent on salaries or contracted services.

        <p>Expecting a decrease in financing over the next few years, Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, is recruiting volunteers to deliver social services to the poor.</p>
        <p>Thomas A. DeStefano, executive director of the agency, said it is relying more heavily on a network of 1,600 volunteers, saving money that would otherwise be spent on salaries or contracted services. He pointed to the example of a retired couple who cook meals in a center for the elderly in their Brooklyn neighborhood.</p>
        <p>"There are some things the local communities just cannot provide, so we step in with our volunteers," Mr. DeStefano said. "They are working in their own communities, where they are already invested and really want to make a difference."</p>
        <p>Catholic Charities may fall about $100,000 short of its $5 million budget because longtime donors are not able to give as much this year. "Up until this year we have been holding our own," Mr. DeStefano said. "But times are harder and people are really feeling threatened by the economy."</p>
        <p>A loss of $150,000 from the city Department of Youth Services means 15 staff positions will be eliminated, affecting services for children. Project Bridge, in Bushwick, Brooklyn, will lose four after-school programs for 240 children aged 6 to 12. A skills-building program in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, called Pass II Play will be eliminated.</p>
        <p>Catholic Charities was founded in 1899 when several smaller agencies in Brooklyn and Queens pooled their resources. It now offers dozens of services, including job training for teen-agers, prison ministry and day-care centers. Six mental health clinics provide individual and group counseling for people of all ages. A program delivers hot meals to more than 5,000 homebound elderly people. A refugee resettlement program provides emergency help, counseling and job training to new immigrants. And a Human Mobile Outreach Team provides help to mentally ill homeless people in Brooklyn and Queens.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeStefano said the organization's four Family Action Centers, which receive no government funding, desperately need private donations. The centers, which provide crisis intervention, emergency assistance and long-term counseling, serve more than 35,000 families a year. Their services include parenting workshops, support groups for grandmothers and child safety workshops. But only 10 to 15 people staff each center, with a total budget of $2 million.</p>
        <p>"People come to these centers with every kind of issue you can imagine, and our staff monitors each case," Mr. DeStefano said. "But with limited resources, there's no way they can cover the whole barrage of issues that arrive on their doorsteps."</p>
