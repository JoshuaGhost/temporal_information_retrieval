        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The tragic war in Bosnia has brought into currency a number of half-truths, among which are that Britain and France are reluctant to take military action against their ally of World Wars I and II, Serbia.</p>
        <p>It is true that in the First World War Serbia was an ally of Britain and France against Germany and Austria. But it should also be remembered that the act that precipitated the outbreak of war -- the assassination of the Austrian archduke in Sarajevo -- was committed by a Serbian nationalist to advance the cause of Greater Serbia. That goal again brought about the war first against Croatia, and which continues now against Bosnia.</p>
        <p>During World War II Churchill decided to give British support to the partisans of Tito (Serbs and Croats and other Yugoslavs), and not to the Serbian Chetniks, following the mission of Fitzroy MacLean to Yugoslavia. As to the so-called alliance between Serbia and France during World War II, which France? Vichy? De Gaulle? How could de Gaulle, in London, ally with the Serbian Chetniks when Churchill allied with Tito's Partisans?</p>
        <p>Sympathy with former allies is another fig leaf to conceal the absence of will of the British and French to honor the commitments they made in the United Nations and in NATO to protect the "safe areas" in Bosnia.
