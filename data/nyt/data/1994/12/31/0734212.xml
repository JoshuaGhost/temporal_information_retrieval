        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Dec. 23 letters by Gerry E. Feinberg and Benjamin Brafman, both lawyers, point out two flaws in our system of trial by jury -- hardship to jurors and lengthy trials. These are not the only problems, nor the worst.</p>
        <p>Trial by jury is costly, unwieldy, wasteful and time consuming. Its use was developed in England and other European states during the Middle Ages as a response to autocratic rule and later as a safeguard of personal and political liberty. Today it is largely an anachronism and obsolete.</p>
        <p>There is indeed a viable alternative: its abolition.</p>
        <p>No system of judicial administration can claim perfection. But a panel of carefully selected judges (the number depending on the nature and gravity of the case), functioning unfettered by the burden and responsibility of a jury and subject to appellate review, is more capable of rendering a speedy determination in keeping with the law and the facts.</p>
        <p>By dint of background, training, experience and professional and moral disciplines, such a tribunal is apt to reach a just and equitable decision, and less likely to commit a miscarriage of justice.</p>
        <p>This is in contrast to the unpredictable, unsophisticated, untrained, undisciplined and frequently prejudiced jury of 12 lay peers. At best, the jury is a drag upon the judicial process. At worst, it is an insidious peril.  S. EZRA AUSTERN  Brooklyn, Dec. 27 1994 The writer is a lawyer.</p>
