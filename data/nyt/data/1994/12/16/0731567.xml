        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Peter Passell notes (Economic Scene, Dec. 8) that official poverty rates are based on the assumption that an income three times as large as the basic food budget would put people above the poverty line. This criterion is interesting compared with that used by Cato the Censor in the second century B.C.</p>
        <p>Relying on Cato's estimates, F. R. Cowell, in "Cicero and the Roman Republic," calculated the annual budget of a minimum-wage free laborer and his wife during this period: food, 52 percent; clothing, 8 percent; rent and extras, 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Food consisted of whole-wheat porridge, some vegetables, oil, salt, and watered-down wine.</p>
        <p>In the cooler climate of the United States, clothing's share would grow and food's decline. It seems reasonable to conclude that Republican Rome's definition of the poverty line as a multiple of food needs is similar to Republican America's.</p>
        <p>If the Roman worker's wage fell below the poverty line, he would have to give up his apartment. If his wages went higher, he would be replaced by a slave. To protect themselves, laborers rioted to extract subsidies from the authorities. This state of affairs lasted in Europe until the late 19th century, when modern welfare systems were developed.</p>
        <p>Although slavery may now be gone, labor-replacing technology exists, and we may expect Roman-like behavior from the urban poor of the United States if welfare systems are dismantled.</p>
        <p>After tiring of putting down disturbances, Republican America could reinstitute the welfare system. Things really don't change much.</p>
