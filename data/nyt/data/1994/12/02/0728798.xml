        <p>Lorillard Inc. and Ally &amp; Gargano in New York said yesterday that they would end their relationship on the Newport and Old Gold cigarettes account, effective March 1, citing "creative differences." As a result, the account, with billings estimated at $18 million to $20 million, has been placed in review.</p>
        <p>Arthur Stevens, a senior vice president at Lorillard in New York, said the company would "terminate" Ally "due to differences over the direction of the Newport advertising." That brand's long-running campaign, which carries the theme "Alive With Pleasure," features male and female models in odd poses in pools, pumpkin patches and other unusual locales.</p>

        <p>Bill Luceno, chairman and chief executive at Ally, said the relationship was ending mutually "over the way the outdoor and print ads would be executed, what the pictures look like." Ally has handled Newport since 1986, when it acquired the brand's agency, MCA Advertising.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA</p>
