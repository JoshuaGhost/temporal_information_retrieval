        <p>The unemployed computer expert accused of making the firebomb that literally exploded in his face on a crowded subway train on Wednesday was plotting to set off a series of firebombs in a bizarre extortion scheme to hold New York City's subways and their riders ransom, police officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The critically burned suspect, Edward J. Leary, 49, was arrested in his hospital bed around 2 A.M., an hour after officers searching his house in Scotch Plains, N.J., found a half-dozen pages of angry handwritten notes referring to the extortion plan.

        <p>The unemployed computer expert accused of making the firebomb that literally exploded in his face on a crowded subway train on Wednesday was plotting to set off a series of firebombs in a bizarre extortion scheme to hold New York City's subways and their riders ransom, police officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The critically burned suspect, Edward J. Leary, 49, was arrested in his hospital bed around 2 A.M., an hour after officers searching his house in Scotch Plains, N.J., found a half-dozen pages of angry handwritten notes referring to the extortion plan. They also discovered bomb-making instructions as well as glass jars, nine-volt batteries and kitchen timers identical to those the police believe were used to build the firebomb.</p>
        <p>"There were passages that describe placing bombs on the subway and then contacting the authorities and the press with demands," said one official, who, like others involved in the case, spoke only on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Other officials said the notes contained sketches of bombs, detonating devices, plans for placing bombs on trains and even drawings of lines of people being riddled with bullets.</p>
        <p>Police officials believe that the firebomb that exploded on the southbound No. 4 train on Wednesday afternoon, injuring more than 40 people, was actually Mr. Leary's second bomb, coming less than a week after a similar device caused a fire on a subway train passing through Harlem. Officials say Mr. Leary was apparently on his way to plant the second firebomb when it ignited accidentally.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said the materials found in Mr. Leary's home were "consistent with both devices."</p>
        <p>The plan, the police theorize, was for Mr. Leary to carry the firebombs onto the subway looking like packages -- Wednesday's was in a paper shopping bag that, some riders said later, reeked of gasoline. He would then set the timer and get off the train, leaving the device to go off later, the police said.</p>
        <p>Investigators added that the notes indicated the devices were intended to go off in a tunnel, rather than at a station, presumably to cause maximum fear and chaos for riders.</p>
        <p>The investigation, said John Miller, the Deputy Police Commissioner for Public Information, "suggests there was a scheme to create an air of fear and use that fear at a later time to extort money."</p>
        <p>Mr. Leary was charged with 45 counts of first-degree assault, one for each injured passenger. District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau said the charges would insure that if convicted, the suspect would spend "the rest of his life in state prison." Other charges are possible, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leary, who suffered burns over about 40 percent of his body, was among 16 people who remained hospitalized yesterday because of the explosion. Mr. Leary was being treated at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, and the police have only been able to have short interviews with him.</p>
        <p>Most of the information the police have got from him came from disjointed conversations in the ambulance and one interview with a detective in the hospital, Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>"He could die," Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Leary, two other people remained in critical condition, a 60-year-old man with deep burns over 65 percent of his body and a 40-year-old woman with burns over 35 percent of his body.</p>
        <p>As investigators worked to understand the motives in the case, they also learned more yesterday about Mr. Leary's movements on Wednesday both before and after the explosion. They said he drove to Brooklyn on Wednesday morning after telling his wife he was going to look for work in the financial district. He later took a train to Manhattan and after the explosion he took a zigzagging subway trip back to Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Although investigators say it is clear that his motive was extortion, they do not know exactly who -- the Mayor, the Transit Authority or other officials -- was supposed to pay the extortion.</p>
        <p>Nor was it clear what prompted the extortion campaign. Mr. Leary, who had been unemployed for a year, had taken out a $224,000 mortgage from Citibank when he bought his New Jersey house in 1993 and also owned three apartments in Brooklyn. He has been trying to sell two of the apartments. The third is occupied by a rent-controlled tenant who paid less than $250 a month for an apartment that would otherwise rent for about $900.</p>
        <p>Police officers and Federal agents who searched Mr. Leary's 10-room frame house in Scotch Plains, which was decorated with strings of white Christmas lights and a large American flag, found a trove of bomb-making supplies spread around the floor of a den near the fireplace, law-enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>In addition to the mayonnaise jars, wires, timers and batteries, officials said, there were containers of gasoline, believed to have been used in the devices. And, officials said, there were instructions for making firebombs. Local authorities had been called several times in recent months to investigate mysterious fires in Mr. Leary's house.</p>
        <p>The searchers found the half-dozen handwritten pages, which officials described as a kind of memorandum or outline of the plan to plant the firebombs on the subway and then demand a payoff to stop the bombings. Some of the notes, officials said, were extremely technical, while others were described as "rambling, with lots of anger." "Diversionary explosions" were mentioned, an official said, and there were drawings of bombs and remote-control devices.</p>
        <p>In addition, the police found mention of making a videotaped set of instructions for building a bomb, along with a number of videotape cassettes. A search warrant is being sought to view the tapes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leary was remembered over the past day by those who knew him as a cantankerous, combative man, who quarreled with fellow members of his Brooklyn co-op board over the costs of redecorating the building and annoyed his suburban neighbors with his habit of constantly chopping wood.</p>
        <p>When these people attempted to describe him, one word kept coming up: "weird." He had been dismissed from his last job, as a computer systems architect at Merrill Lynch, the company said, for "performance reasons" last January.</p>
        <p>The police were not sure yesterday what caused the firebomb to go off prematurely, setting several passengers ablaze and sending hundreds scattering in terror, abandoning briefcases and Christmas presents.</p>
        <p>From Mr. Leary's injuries -- his face burned, his hands scorched, the bottoms of his trousers shredded by flame, his legs burned and his sneakers virtually fused to his feet -- it appeared he was seated, holding the shopping bag between his legs. One possibility is that he was setting the timer and touched off the firebomb by mistake.</p>
        <p>In the incident aboard the train in Harlem in which two teen-agers were burned last week, the police had originally suspected that a 13-year old girl had been carrying the device in her backpack. But police officials now say that they believe she was not involved and that further investigation suggested that the firebomb had actually gone off under the seat of the train.</p>
        <p>Police officials would not say specifically how the firebomb worked. But Christopher Ronay, former head of the F.B.I. bomb laboratory, now at the Institute of Makers of Explosives in Washington, said the batteries had to have been connected to an igniter, like an electric match, a light bulb or a flash bulb.</p>
        <p>He added: "Odds are the igniter would be inside the jar, but not in the liquid, and when it pops it breaks the jar, spewing out the fuel and ignites the fuel.</p>
