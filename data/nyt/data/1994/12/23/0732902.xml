        <p>In large measure, Mexico's financial future rests with American investment firms. But the events of the last two days, the latest in a string of shocking surprises this year, have led some to wonder if Mexico is truly on its way to becoming a relatively safe place to invest.</p>
        <p>"The assumption was that in 1995 Mexico would become investment grade," said Joyce Chang, a director of emerging markets research at Salomon Brothers in New York. "In the short term, that is not now likely to happen."</p>
        <p>The stunning decision by Mexico to devalue the peso, and then allow its currency to float against the dollar, has shaken but not completely shattered Wall Street's confidence in Mexico's continued transition from a debt-ridden third world nation to a prosperous, free-market-oriented economy.</p>
        <p>The damage suffered by Mexico's credibility can be measured in the way financial markets have treated the country's assets: In the space of two days, the value of peso-denominated assets like stocks and bonds have fallen by nearly 30 percent.</p>
        <p>"We feel Mexico will recover," said Ed Cabrera, manager of Latin American strategy for Merrill Lynch &amp; Company. "The question is how long that will take."</p>
        <p>Yet even before the current crisis, money managers were starting to move substantial amounts of money out of Mexico. After heavy inflows from 1991 to 1993, it was a development that the members of the international financial community had anticipated.</p>
        <p>"It is important that investors in these markets recognize the uncertainties, and it is probably most practical to take a medium-term perspective," said Charles Dallara, managing director of the Institute for International Finance in Washington, which represents commercial banks around the world.</p>
        <p>Since the start of the year, most of the money that has flowed out of Mexico has come from its bond market, according to statistical estimates from the institute.</p>
        <p>From a peak in February to Dec. 8, offshore holdings of peso-denominated bonds shrank by nearly two-thirds, to slightly more than $5 billion. That number is almost certainly smaller now.</p>
        <p>The drop in equity holdings has not been nearly as severe.</p>
        <p>At the end of November, the institute estimated, foreign holdings on the Mexican stock exchange and in Mexican stocks that traded in American depository receipts in the United States amounted to slightly more than $50 billion, down from a peak of more than $60 billion in January.</p>
        <p>Those changes, along with the decision that many Mexicans have apparently made recently to get some of their own money out of the country, have driven down Mexico's foreign reserves to an estimated $8 billion, from about $30 billion at the start of the year.</p>
        <p>"Two weeks ago," Ms. Chang of Salomon Brothers said, "people didn't think that Mexico would have lower foreign exchange reserves than Venezuela."</p>
        <p>What had once been seen as only a slow seepage turned into a rapid outflow of funds this week.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the day before the devaluation, the value of J. P. Morgan's emerging market bond index, a basket of 25 bonds, closed at 189.35. The index fell sharply on Wednesday, and was down by almost 3 percent yesterday, closing at 175.27. Since its peak in early January, the index has lost nearly 20 percent of its value.</p>
        <p>There have been worse one-day declines. The biggest was on April 4, when the J. P. Morgan index fell by 4.2 percent. And on March 23, two days after the Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was assassinated, the index lost 3.7 percent of its value.</p>
        <p>Despite the carnage, some investors now see a chance to pick up bargains. "Investors are very angry about what has gone on, but a lot of people think it is too late to sell," said Geoffrey E. J. Dennis, head of Latin American equity research at Bear, Stearns &amp; Company. "We have talked to a lot of clients who are looking for opportunities to buy."</p>
