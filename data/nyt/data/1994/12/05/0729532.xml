        <p>"There is no great virtue in quantity," he said the other day. "I remind myself that Emily Bronte wrote a single novel -- and then she died at 29."</p>
        <p>Tomorrow evening, Houghton Mifflin, the publisher of 41 of his 50 works, is giving him a dinner at its headquarters in Boston to celebrate "The Collected Stories of Louis Auchincloss" and the milestone it signifies.</p>
        <p>Many pieces in the anthology, written from 1949 to 1994, include "a lot of stories which were moldering in out-of-print editions," he said. "I went through all my books and selected the ones I thought were best. They simply jumped out at me."</p>
