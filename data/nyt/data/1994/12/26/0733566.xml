        <p>Houston Astros pitcher GREG SWINDELL is considering breaking ranks with other major leaguers if the baseball strike isn't resolved before spring training.</p>
        <p>"I have very few friends in baseball right now that I'm close and personal with, anyway," Swindell told a television station, KRIV in Houston. "If the time comes and things happen, they can think what they want."</p>
        <p>Swindell added: "I've got house payments, I've got ex-wife payments, I've got a 5-year-old, a 3-year-old and a 7-week-old. It's going to be a tough decision. We'll make it when the time comes."</p>
        <p>Swindell was 8-9 last season with a 4.37 earned run average. He's set to make $4.2 million in 1995 and $5.3 million in 1996. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL</p>
