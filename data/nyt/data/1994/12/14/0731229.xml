        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There has been a great deal of news media attention to the issue of sending United States troops to the Golan Heights, as well as a full-page advertisement in your paper discouraging the use of such troops (Dec. 7). Readers need to be made aware of the context of these efforts to mobilize American public opinion against sending troops.</p>
        <p>Everyone is deeply concerned about the safety and security of American soldiers. No one favors hastily and irresponsibly dispatching American G.I.'s to dangerous areas in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>However, Israel and Syria have not even reached a peace agreement. Complete information about the dangers of sending troops is unavailable because the terms of a possible Syrian-Israeli agreement are not yet known; Syria and Israel have not yet requested American troops, and security conditions in the region are in a constant state of flux.</p>
        <p>More is at issue here than just concern for the safety of our troops. Many of the individuals and organizations behind the anti-troop effort have another agenda: opposing the Middle East peace process. They hope to scare Americans into opposing the option of American troops on the Golan, which would in turn make reaching an Israeli-Syrian agreement more difficult.</p>
        <p>Debate and discussion about the topic is warranted. Americans should be aware, however, that any urgency expressed to make a decision on the matter now is premature and may reflect a hidden political agenda. ABRAHAM H. FOXMAN  National Director Anti-Defamation League New York, Dec. 8, 1994</p>
