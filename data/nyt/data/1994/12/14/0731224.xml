        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines make a good team for New York City. Mr. Giuliani's demand for budget reform has saved millions. Mr. Cortines has gotten the schools focused on teaching. Unfortunately, the two men get along so badly that the Mayor seems intent on making Mr. Cortines miserable enough to quit. The Chancellor says he will decide about that next week.</p>
        <p>Both men and the city have too much to lose for this confrontation to end badly. Mr. Giuliani's valuable reforms will suffer if he comes off as mindlessly dictatorial. The school system, which has had six leaders in 11 years, will slip into turmoil.</p>
        <p>For months now, the two men have collided on budget cuts, which are necessary, and managerial reform, which the Mayor says is moving too slowly. Mr. Giuliani, with some justification, has portrayed the Chancellor as a defender of the status quo. It was his prodding that forced Mr. Cortines to ax 2,500 jobs from the central headquarters staff.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Giuliani oversteps when he demands, in effect, that the Chancellor step down so that he can guide the Board of Education in choosing a new one. The citizens voted for a forceful Mayor, but they did not give him a license to override the Board of Education entirely.</p>
        <p>A majority of the seven-member central Board of Education wants to offer Mr. Cortines a two-year extension of his contract. Many civic leaders who otherwise support Mr. Giuliani and are impressed with his first year as Mayor believe he is on the wrong track with a dismissal-by-torment. He needs to consider these judgments and review his statement of no confidence about Mr. Cortines's ability to run the schools.</p>
        <p>The job Mr. Cortines has done is in many ways admirable. He has focused consistently on teaching and learning. In just 15 months on the job he has instituted curriculum guidelines that spell out what students should know by certain grades, increased graduation requirements in math and science and put new emphasis on improving writing skills. He has set out rigorous improvement plans for low-performing schools and for junior high schools.</p>
        <p>But the Chancellor needs to study harder the managerial and fiscal reforms urged by City Hall. The Giuliani administration's budget sense and Mr. Cortines's educational wisdom ought to add up to something other than a bloodletting. Right now, the betting is that the Mayor can win this confrontation. But running Mr. Cortines back to California will not bring honor to Mr. Giuliani's administration or stability to the schools.</p>
