        <p>ORCHIDS are like potato chips. You can't grow just one. Although the plants themselves are often just a bunch of ugly leaves, when the orchid finally blooms, the enchantment is indescribable. And their amazing variety causes hobbyists to try one species after another.</p>
        <p>The plants will reward patient growers about once a year, with blooms ranging in size from those you have to peer at with a hand lens to those that fill the hands. Orchids may have spots, stripes, frills, tails, fringes and amazing colors. Some are even deliciously fragrant.</p>

        <p>ORCHIDS are like potato chips. You can't grow just one. Although the plants themselves are often just a bunch of ugly leaves, when the orchid finally blooms, the enchantment is indescribable. And their amazing variety causes hobbyists to try one species after another.</p>
        <p>The plants will reward patient growers about once a year, with blooms ranging in size from those you have to peer at with a hand lens to those that fill the hands. Orchids may have spots, stripes, frills, tails, fringes and amazing colors. Some are even deliciously fragrant.</p>
        <p>There is almost no limit to what can be grown. Depending on what books you read there could be as many as 30,000 orchid species throughout the world. And new ones are being found every year. And many florists now stock orchid plants, so availability is less of a problem than it once was.</p>
        <p>The trick is in keeping the plants alive for future bloom. But if the plants are placed in proper light and given the moisture they need, care should be no problem.</p>
        <p>Orchids can be found just about everywhere in the world. The majority of them grow on trees as epiphytes in tropical climates. Many thrive high in the canopies where few see them. Others, the terrestrials, are almost trod upon on strolls through meadows and woodlands in this country.</p>
        <p>Those who try to grow orchids at home should know that the plants should be arranged according to the temperatures they require. Charles Marden Fitch, in "All About Orchids," divides the plants into three categories: warm, intermediate and cool. Warm means 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, intermediate is 55 to 65 degrees and cool is 45 to 55 degrees.</p>
        <p>Newcomers to orchid growing often overlook the basic needs of these rewarding plants. Possibly the most important one is humidity. American homes tend to be desert dry, a quality that orchids find stultifying. Some hobbyists have found that putting all their orchid plants in one area and supplying a humidifier helps. Others keep their collections in humidity-controlled enclosures.  The goal is to achieve 40 to 50 percent humidity.</p>
        <p>Remember, too, that the plants are going to need good air circulation and light. A bright window sill or bay window may supply the best environment for these special plants.</p>
        <p>One of the finest indoor collections ever seen was in a Manhattan apartment, growing in an east-facing window where the plants were kept on a metal tray about three inches deep and filled with clean white pebbles. There always was an orchid or two in bloom because species were selected to provide constant flowers.</p>
        <p>Although indoor plant hobbyists cannot grow every species, especially some of those trickier terrestrial and tropical kinds, there are several genera that do well indoors with relatively little attention.</p>
        <p>One of the most popular for indoor growing is the cymbidium clan -- or tribe, as some growers call the orchid groups. These members of the cool category have flaring blooms in spring with extraordinary colors and grasslike leaves. Florists grow them as long-lasting cut flowers.</p>
        <p>One of the most curious is the paphiopedilum or lady slipper orchid. The flowers all have a waxy texture and long keeping qualities. This is truly an easy-to-grow orchid and particularly well adapted to live on a window sill. One caution: this is one orchid that grows continuously, and the medium should never be allowed to dry out.</p>
        <p>Then there is the cattleya, which might be referred to in old-fashioned parlance as the corsage orchid. This is the one that a generation and more ago courting youths purchased to pin on their ladies for the high school prom. Now there are all sorts of hybrids and sizes and those who fancy the flowers grow them with abandon. This particular tribe of orchids grows best when it is planted in a well-draining medium such as fern or fir bark. In fact sometimes charcoal is mixed in with the planting medium. In between waterings this medium should be allowed to dry out.</p>
        <p>The important point when growing orchids is to do some serious homework to know the specifics of culture for the particular plant chosen. There are several excellent books on orchid culture, many mail order catalogues ship orchid plants with instructions and if the urge gets really serious, one can hunt up an orchid society to keep up with the latest trends. The orchid-growing hobby is easy to start and there is ample help out there to keep growers on the right tracks.  GARDENING</p>
