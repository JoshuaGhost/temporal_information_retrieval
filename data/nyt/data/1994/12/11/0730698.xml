        <p>Generational bonding experiences have always been important in American life. Civil War veterans kept meeting until time scythed down the last of them.

        <p>Generational bonding experiences have always been important in American life. Civil War veterans kept meeting until time scythed down the last of them. The Depression shaped the economic dreams, and fears, of millions of young couples and their children. People who fought in World War II have moved through history with a fortifying set of common memories. So have the children born to them during and shortly after that war.</p>
        <p>This last group profoundly altered the way Americans think about their inner lives, their fellow citizens, the earth upon which we live and the process by which older citizens in Washington decide when and where young Americans die in combat.</p>
        <p>Now, in an excess of Republican triumphalism, the party's new leaders have decided to make "counterculture" into a pejorative. What flapdoodle. Only a few periods in American history have seen such a rich fulfillment of the informing ideals of personal freedom and creativity that lie at the heart of the American intellectual tradition. Like many of his elders, Representative Newt Gingrich may prefer a stricter regimen of social conformity and religious observance.</p>
        <p>But the millions of Americans who incorporated the cultural ideals of the Sixties and the decade's healthy spirit of political activism are foolish to abandon the high ground because of his post-election slanging. Certainly the excesses of the decade are easy to parody, and its summery, hedonistic ethos then and now reduced modern puritans to fits of twisting discomfort. America is still close enough to the frontier experience of relentless work and danger to view any kind of fun with suspicion.</p>
        <p>No true historian, however, can believe that it is possible to repudiate so large a cultural event in a nation's history, or to dismiss its seminal political events as a "McGovern-nik" aberration.</p>
        <p>The 60's spawned a new morality-based politics that emphasized the individual's responsibility to speak out against injustice and corruption. It was this renewed sense of responsibility that led enough people to raise their voices to end America's most disastrous foreign military adventure, the Vietnam War. On this level, the Sixties saw an exercise in mass sanity in which a nation's previously voiceless citizens -- its young -- overturned a war policy that was, in fact, deranged.</p>
        <p>The spirit of the age, like the tactics of the antiwar movement, was shaped by the civil rights movement. Its lessons of citizen empowerment, to use the 90's term, led to the progress of the environmental, women's and gay rights movements. The counterculture, in sum, produced a renewal of the Thoreauvian ideal of the clear, defiant voice of the dissenting citizen.</p>
        <p>There was another empowering aspect of the counterculture's confrontation with the Washington monolith. Those days produced the sad wisdom, now indispensable in American politics, that the Government will lie to protect its interests and that constant vigilance is necessary to keep it honest.</p>
        <p>The influence of 60's individualism was not limited to politics. It fostered a psychological movement that, while it burdened our shelves with tomes of psychobabble, also enabled people in emotional torment to ask for help without being stigmatized. It gave people in dead or abusive relationships permission to break out.</p>
        <p>Would many Americans truly like to imagine a society returned to the dictatorship of the majority culture? Would they like to go back to the days of blatant, sanctioned discrimination against African-Americans and women, to a world deprived of all the 60's ingredients that still simmer in the cultural stew, including an American music that has become a global language?</p>
        <p>We think not. For one thing, there are too many Republicans who are also Grateful Dead fans or, for that matter, divorced, ex-potheads and opponents of state-regulated prayer and abortion.</p>
        <p>At its essence, the counterculture was about one of conservatives' favorite words: values. It was a repudiation of the blind obedience and reflexive cynicism of politics as usual. It was about exposing hypocrisy, whether personal or political, and standing up to irrational authority. As in any large movement, it accommodated its share of charlatans and sociopaths. But it is part of us, a legacy around which Americans can now unite, rather than allow themselves to be divided.</p>
