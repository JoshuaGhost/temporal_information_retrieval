        <p>Stowe, Vt., began its life as a resort after the Civil War, when railroad passengers came in the summer to take the mountain air. Once the tourists started coming, they never stopped, and today Stowe -- which celebrated its bicentennial this year -- is one of Vermont's most popular year-round resorts. In winter, it is a mecca for skiers and shoppers, a magnet for out-of-staters, and the town where Vermonters take antsy house guests, assured that there will be plenty to do. From the heart of the still-picturesque village, the Mountain Road, as Route 108 is called, forms a seven-mile-long corridor of shops, restaurants, bars, motels and inns leading to the slopes of the state's tallest mountain, the 4,393-foot Mount Mansfield.</p>
        <p>The Stowe Area Association, Post Office Box 1320, Stowe, Vt. 05672, (800) 247-8693, has an office in the center of the village. Its phone number also serves as the central reservations and information service, which books rooms for more than 65 places to stay and packages for downhill and cross-country skiers.  Rates often increase during the holiday weeks and, later in the season, Presidents Week, times when rooms fill up well in advance.  Winter Sports</p>
        <p>The Stowe Mountain Resort (802) 253-3000, with its 46 trails (including the well-known Front Four double-diamond trails for experts), 11 lifts, and eight-passenger gondola, offers a variety of single, multiday and night-skiing tickets. Lodging at the resort is available by calling (800) 253-4754. Although lift lines are generally short, they can run 20 to 45 minutes during the holiday weeks. A one-day lift ticket is $43, with discounts on multiday tickets. For snow conditions, call (802) 253-3600.</p>

        <p>Stowe, Vt., began its life as a resort after the Civil War, when railroad passengers came in the summer to take the mountain air.

        <p>The Stowe Mountain Resort (802) 253-3000, with its 46 trails (including the well-known Front Four double-diamond trails for experts), 11 lifts, and eight-passenger gondola, offers a variety of single, multiday and night-skiing tickets.

A one-day lift ticket is $43, with discounts on multiday tickets. For snow conditions, call (802) 253-3600.</p>
        <p>Cross-country skiers will find a 93-mile trail system, billed as the largest groomed trail network in the East. It is made of trails from four ski centers: the Trapp Family Lodge, (802) 253-8511; the Stowe Mountain Resort, (802) 253-3000; Edson Hill Manor, (800) 621-0284, and Topnotch Resort and Spa, (802) 253-8585 or (800) 451-8686. A one-day pass is $10, $6 for children 6 to 12.  Cross-country skiers may also ski free on the five-mile Stowe Recreation Path, which extends from the Community Church in the village, along the West Branch of the Little River, to the Topnotch Resort. It is not groomed, but is tracked by other skiers.</p>
        <p>Back-country skiing and snowshoe expeditions can be arranged through Umiak Outfitters, (802) 253-2317, which also offers private lessons in both sports. Umiak regularly offers daylong snowshoe trips for $25 a person, including a basic lesson, equipment rental and transportation to the selected site. Umiak is in the lower part of the village, next to Commodores Inn.</p>
        <p>It costs $2 to skate at the municipally run Jackson Arena, on a hill behind the village elementary school. Call (802) 253-6148 for public skating hours. The Commodores Inn, (802) 253-7131 or (800) 447-8693, offers free skating on a small lakewhen the weather allows.</p>
        <p>Winter horseback riding is available through Edson Hill Manor, (802) 253-7371, for $24 a person for a 50-minute guided ride, as are sleigh rides, for $35 a couple. Other establishments offering sleigh rides include the Stowehof Inn, (800) 932-7136, the Trapp Family Lodge and Topnotch (see phone numbers above).</p>
        <p>Beginner snowmobilers can rent machines from Nichols Snowmobile Rentals, (802) 253-7239, for $45 an hour for a two-seater, including a basic lesson and access to two miles of meadow trails.</p>
        <p>And if you need to thaw out, the spa at the Topnotch Resort contains 23,000 square feet devoted to an indoor lap pool, a whirlpool with a hydro-massage waterfall, saunas and steam rooms, weight and cardiovascular training equipment, and fitness classes. Nonguests pay $15 an hour or $25 a day, including gratuities and use of a spa wardrobe (robe, slippers, shorts and T-shirt).  Open daily from 8:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M. Many packages are available. Events</p>
        <p>The Helen Day Art Center, School Street, sponsors its annual Festival of Christmas Trees through Jan. 8. This year, in honor of Stowe's bicentennial, the festival features trees decorated with hand-crafted ornaments depicting aspects of Stowe's history. The charge is $2, $1 over age 65, and 50 cents for students. Open daily, noon to 5 P.M. except Mondays during this show. Call (802) 253-8358.</p>
        <p>The main event of the season is the Stowe Winter Carnival, (800) 247-8693, Jan. 13 to 22, which has a Mardi Gras atmosphere on a colder and smaller scale. Over the course of the 10 days, about 5,000 people are expected to attend the festivities, which include a snow-sculpture competition, a snow-golf tournament (played with tennis balls and modified clubs), a mountain-bike derby, snowshoe and ski races, and a dogsled race. On Village Night, Jan. 14, Main Street is closed to traffic and costumed characters wander the village, greeting pedestrians and mingling with clowns, magicians and jugglers. The evening begins with a chicken-pie supper at the Stowe Community Church and culminates with fireworks. Many events are free. For information call the Stowe Area Association.</p>
        <p>The Stowe Olympic Challenge, (800) 247-8693, Jan. 6 to 8, raises money for the United States Olympic Committee with ski races and parties with Olympic skaters and other celebrities. Billy Kidd, an Olympic silver medalist, and Andrea Mead Lawrence, a gold medalist, are scheduled to attend. An Olympic Weekend package is available through the Stowe Area Association for $149 a person including two nights' lodging, two days of downhill skiing, night skiing, opening ceremony and an apres-ski party. Part of the proceeds goes to the Olympic Committee. Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Any tour of Stowe begins in the village, situated at the crossroads of Route 100 and Route 108 and anchored on the northern end by the Stowe Community Church, an elegant building of simple lines and a soaring spire. A counterpoint to the church is the old Stowe High School, an 1861 Greek Revival building, which was saved from demolition 14 years ago. The renovated building now houses the Helen Day Art Center and the Stowe Free Public Libary. The art center is home to a lively series of shows, and the library is open to visitors.</p>
        <p>Strollers in the village invariably stop at the timeless Lackey's Variety Store for a newspaper and some penny candy and Shaw's General Store, which opened in 1895 and now sells primarily clothing and sporting goods. The Green Mountain Inn, (802) 253-7301, which dates to 1833, is on the National Register of Historic Places and helps preserve a vestige of the village as it was in the 1800's. It offers 64 rooms, starting at $105 a night, two restaurants and adjacent shops.</p>
        <p>The town operates a trolley, which runs at 20-minute intervals from the village up the Mountain Road to the ski slopes, with stops at hotels and inns. The trolley, which accommodates ski equipment, costs $1 one way. A $5 weeklong pass offers unlimited rides, but many hotels include these in their rates. Where to Eat</p>
        <p>The Blue Moon Cafe, 35 School Street, Stowe, (802) 253-7006, is a relatively new and welcome addition to the town's food scene. The varied menu in this small, lovely restaurant next to the Helen Day Center changes weekly. A dinner (appetizer, entree, dessert and wine) runs about $70 for two, without tax and tip. Open daily for lunch and dinner, Sunday for brunch and dinner.</p>
        <p>The Edson Hill Manor, (802) 253-7371, with its gorgeous mountain views, offers dinner for two for about $90. The butternut squash ravioli is a house favorite, and the only menu item that remains constant.</p>
        <p>The Cliff House, Stowe Mountain Resort, (802) 253-3665, is 3,700 feet high on the eastern slope of Mount Mansfield, and is reached by gondola. The fixed-price four-course dinner is $39 a person, without beverages, tax and tip (but including the gondola ride). It opens for the season on Friday, serving lunch and dinner Wednesday through Sunday (daily during Christmas week and Presidents' Week).</p>
        <p>A great spot for children is the Depot Street Malt Shop, 57 Depot Street; (802) 253-4269, which offers a basic, reasonably priced burgers-and-fries menu and a large selection of ice-cream sundaes in a 1950's setting. Lunch or dinner for a family of four, including sundaes, runs about $25. The restaurant is just off Main Street in the center of the village.</p>
        <p>Tourists flock to lunch at the Austrian Tea Room at the Trapp Family Lodge, and are rewarded by decent, reasonably priced food, friendly service and incredible views of the Worcester mountain range.</p>
        <p>Lunch for two, with dessert, costs about $25. Late afternoon is a less crowded time.  Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Stowe offers 2,500 rooms, although they are getting harder to find at the low end of the scale. Many establishments provide packages, some including lift tickets. Rates go up during the holidays. Winter rates, quoted below, start next weekend.</p>

The inn, set on 225 wooded acres, has antique-filled rooms (some with fireplaces) in the Manor House and spacious accommodations (all with fireplaces) in the Carriage House. Double rooms start at $100, with breakfast, and $140 with dinner and breakfast.</p>
        <p>Some of the best views are at the 93-room Trapp Family Lodge, 42 Trapp Hill Road, Stowe 05672; (802) 253-8511 or (800) 826-7000, fax (802) 253-7864.
