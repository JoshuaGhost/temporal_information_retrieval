        <p>The Justice Department has concluded that the systems used to pick about a fifth of the State Supreme Court justices now sitting in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan violate the Voting Rights Act and must be replaced, Justice officials said tonight.</p>
        <p>Federal civil rights lawyers were preparing a letter to New York authorities asserting that the state used methods for selecting 42 State Supreme Court justices that were unfair to minority voters. The three boroughs have a total of more than 200 Supreme Court justices, who preside over most serious criminal and civil trials.</p>
        <p>The letter challenged both election and appointment procedures used to pick justices in the three boroughs, and threatened to upset the mechanisms used to fill a rapidly expanding bench overwhelmed by a huge docket of cases. Judges in Queens and Staten Island would be unaffected by the action.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials would not disclose the contents of the letter, being written tonight against a midnight deadline. But lawyers familiar with it said it outlined the Justice Department's objections to 27 justices appointed to the State Supreme Court from lower courts, as well as to 15 justices elected under a procedure in which candidates were chosen through a convention system. Justice Department officials have said that such convention systems, controlled by political parties, can be unfair to minority voters.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials said they were shaping the terms of their objections to try to avoid throwing the city's judicial system into chaos. They said the impact on the court caseload would be minimal because the state would be allowed to move gradually in adopting an elective system that would better protect minority voters. Moreover, Justice Department officials said the justices who are under challenge would not immediately be affected by the action but could continue sitting on the bench, issuing rulings that would not be legally impaired.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the Voting Rights Act, state officials can appeal the Justice Department's findings in Federal court or propose changes to satisfy the Department's objections. State officials could not be reached for comment tonight.</p>
        <p>Supreme Court justices in New York State are normally elected. But the use of appointed justices to fill out the bench has grown in recent decades along with the caseload in New York City, in part because creating additional elective judgeships requires action by the State Legislature, a process that has bogged down in partisan wrangling. In some instances, increasing the number of elected justices would have required amending the State Constitution.</p>
        <p>The appointed justices, known as acting justices, are technically considered temporary but sometimes serve longer than a decade. They make up roughly half the justices sitting in the Supreme Court's branches in the city.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department began an investigation of the state's selection methods earlier this year to determine whether the filling of judicial posts by appointment rather than by election was discriminatory because it diluted minority voting strength. The investigation came after a state commission found the judicial selection procedures to be unfair to minority voters.</p>
        <p>The appointment procedure has doubled the size of the city's Supreme Court judicial contingent, and some lawyers have said that shifting abruptly to a completely elective system could undermine a bench regarded as competent and efficient, with appointed judges who are often among the city's best.</p>
        <p>But court officials have said minority justices do not hold many of the appointive seats. Of the more than 120 appointive justices on the bench in Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx as of July, nearly 90 percent were white, 7 percent were black and 4 percent were Hispanic. Of the nearly 90 elected justices sitting in Supreme Court in the same boroughs, 73 percent were white, 18 percent were black and 9 percent were Hispanic.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials have said the state did not receive the necessary approval -- or "preclearance" -- to enlarge the court by appointing acting justices in those boroughs. Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, states with areas having a history of discrimination in voting must obtain advance approval from the Justice Department or from the District Court here before making any change affecting voting in those areas. Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx are covered under this law because of their historically low minority voting rates.</p>
        <p>The acting justices are judges who are elevated to the Supreme Court from the New York City Civil Court and Criminal Court or transferred to it from the State Court of Claims. As acting Supreme Court justices, they have the same powers and salary -- $108,500 -- as their elected counterparts.</p>
