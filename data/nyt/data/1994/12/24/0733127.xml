        <p>Angered by baseball club owners' decision Thursday night to impose a salary cap on players, several senior members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- said today that they would try to revoke the industry's 72-year-old exemption from antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said he would use his seniority to introduce legislation on Jan. 4, the first day of Congress next year, to repeal the exemption for major league baseball. Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who will head the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he no longer opposed such legislation and would try to push it to the Senate floor quickly.</p>

        <p>Angered by baseball club owners' decision Thursday night to impose a salary cap on players, several senior members of Congress -- Republicans and Democrats -- said today that they would try to revoke the industry's 72-year-old exemption from antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said he would use his seniority to introduce legislation on Jan. 4, the first day of Congress next year, to repeal the exemption for major league baseball. Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who will head the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he no longer opposed such legislation and would try to push it to the Senate floor quickly.</p>
        <p>"I am fast becoming convinced that the majority of the owners are trying to break the players' association," Mr. Hatch said in a telephone interview this afternoon. "I do not want to become involved in collective bargaining negotiations, but I'm starting to believe, like many people, that these negotiations are not being done in good faith."</p>
        <p>The antitrust exemption -- which no other major league sport shares -- allows baseball owners to impose industry-wide salary limits, while remaining partially shielded from any lawsuits that the players may file. The exemption also allows a majority of owners to block other owners who may want to move their franchises to new cities, and to reserve players' freedom to move up to a certain level of service.</p>
        <p>The Senate, in particular, has wrestled with this issue before and produced nothing. Many House Republicans want to pass the party's 10-part Contract with America before doing anything else, said Representative Thomas W. Ewing, Republican of Illinois.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hatch said the legislation had a solid chance of winning House and Senate passage, while Mr. Moynihan said the odds were excellent. "I would put the odds about as close to 100 percent as anything that will be introduced," Mr. Moynihan said.</p>
        <p>Repealing or limiting major league baseball's antitrust exemption has clear political benefits in the current political climate. It allows Republicans and Democrats to take part in a high visibility issue without actually intervening in the tangled labor negotiations.</p>
        <p>Repeal can also be presented as a deregulatory move in keeping with the anti-Government spirit so strongly evident on Election Day last month. And efforts to change the law give lawmakers the appearance of siding with the little guys, no matter how well-paid ballplayers may be.</p>
        <p>Bud Selig, the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and baseball's acting commissioner, said repealing the exemption would not produce labor peace. "If they think that Washington or the courts can solve this problem, it's tragically wrong," he said. "And I don't know what's going to happen in either place, but the only place you're ever going to have a meaningful settlement is at the table."</p>
        <p>Asked whether he was worried about Congressional action, Mr. Selig said: "Look, we've been in Washington a lot. If they want to pursue Washington, there's nothing we can do about that."</p>
        <p>Repeal of the exemption would make it possible for the union to challenge the owners' unilateral implementation in court, but it wouldn't necessarily solve all their problems. For example, they would still need to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with the owners.</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said the current baseball strike has fundamentally changed the politics of an issue that has bedeviled Congress for a quarter of a century. While many members of the House have long supported the repeal of the exemption, the Senate has long been a bastion of resistance.</p>
        <p>Leading the resistance have been senators from states like Pennsylvania and Washington, where franchises like the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Seattle Mariners might someday move to larger or more prosperous cities if the owners could not stop them from doing so. Senators from Florida and Arizona, where such franchises might go, have long pushed for repeal.</p>
        <p>But this year's bitter labor dispute has shifted the focus of the antitrust debate from the franchise issue to one about labor rights.</p>
        <p>Senator Graham said that Mr. Moynihan's involvement was particularly significant because the New York senator, long a backer of worker rights, had not previously taken an interest in it.</p>
        <p>The final bill that emerges from the Senate Judiciary Committee is likely to eliminate the antitrust exemption only for major league baseball and not for minor league baseball, Mr. Hatch said. The exemption also might be only partially repealed for disputes between labor and management, allowing club owners to maintain their restrictions on when and where franchises can move, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch said that he thought the legislation had a good chance to pass the House and Senate, possibly with support from Representative Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who will become the speaker next year.</p>
        <p>"I believe Gingrich is starting to wake up to this issue and a number of other Republican leaders over there -- it's not right" what the owners are doing, Mr. Hatch said.</p>
        <p>Tony Blankley, the press secretary for Mr. Gingrich, declined to comment. But an aide in Mr. Gingrich's Georgia office said the future Speaker had discussed the strike on Monday with three current or former members of the Atlanta Braves: Tom Glavine, Terry Pendleton and Brett Butler.</p>
        <p>Representative George W. Gekas, Republican of Pennsylvania, has already told his Republican colleagues on the House Judiciary Committee that he wants to review baseball's antitrust status next year, said Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, another senior Republican on the Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gekas will be the chairman next year of a Judiciary Committee panel with jurisdiction over antitrust issues. Mr. Gekas's offices here and in Pennsylvania were closed tonight, and he could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who will become the committee's chairman, has also indicated that he will reconsider his previous opposition to repeal, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Hyde's office was closed, and he could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>The White House has avoided taking a position on the antitrust exemption, presumably to leave the way clear for a settlement of the strike. It was unclear today whether that would change in the wake of Thursday night's developments.</p>
        <p>Senator Hatch said that the owners had the right to try to impose an industry-wide salary cap. But the players should have the same right to fight that cap in court as the workers in other industries that do not have special antitrust exemptions, he said.</p>
        <p>"If they want to impose, they have a right to do it, but the players have a right to sue," Senator Hatch said.</p>
        <p>Senator Graham said the imposition of the salary cap had made it more likely that the antitrust exemption would be narrowed or repealed.</p>
        <p>"The fact that congress has been invited to repeal the antitrust exemption by the courts for the better part of 25 years -- and has failed to do so -- indicates it's very much an uphill battle," he said. "However, what happened yesterday substantially altered the slope of that battle."  BASEBALL</p>
