        <p>In less than two weeks, President Boris N. Yeltsin has turned a smoldering rebellion in remote Chechnya into a conflagration that threatens his presidency.</p>
        <p>In the process, Russian politics has been convulsed more violently than at any time since Mr. Yeltsin turned tanks on the Russian Parliament. Military commanders publicly ridicule their President and refuse to carry out orders. Mr. Yeltsin's onetime allies have become his bitter enemies, and his nationalistic detractors of the past have provided the bedrock of his current support.</p>
        <p>Shadowy figures like Mr. Yeltsin's security chief, Gen. Aleksandr Kor zhakov, who has long been an unusually influential adviser, seem to be running the country. Opinion polls published today in the newspaper Izvestia show little support for the war in the Caucasus, which appears to worsen every day.</p>
        <p>None of this seems to have shaken Mr. Yeltsin. Until two weeks ago, if the Russian people were united in anything it was in their antipathy toward the Chechens. Now they are more likely to find common ground in anger toward their leaders.</p>
        <p>Today Yegor T. Gaidar, Mr. Yeltsin's former Prime Minister and perhaps Russia's most recognizable democrat, said the punishing assault on Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, was transforming Russia into a police state. It is an increasingly common fear.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Yeltsin, who sent 40,000 troops into the Caucasus region 10 days ago but has never appeared in public to discuss it, has backed himself and his presidency into a corner from which he may never emerge.</p>
        <p>If he stops the military advance and withdraws the troops, he will have gained neither a resolution nor the support of the Russian people. If he continues the assault, he may soon level a rebellious city that his troops will then have to occupy and somehow govern.</p>
        <p>It is clear the Chechens -- however desperate and poorly prepared -- are willing to fight to the death. Their leader, Dzhokar M. Dudayev, seems to delight in calling the wrath of the Kremlin upon his people. But he is supported for one reason: He believes Chechnya should be independent.</p>
        <p>That kind of certainty makes it almost impossible for Mr. Yeltsin to win, or for Mr. Dudayev to lose. If Russian soldiers storm Grozny, they will certainly take the city, which will then have to be run like a military duchy. That may be a political price that even the increasingly authoritarian leadership here cannot afford to pay.</p>
        <p>"This country is on the verge of dictatorship," Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the parliamentary defense committee, told the newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta today. "I am afraid Yeltsin is not in command now. I am not even sure who is."</p>
        <p>Like many other critics of the invasion, Mr. Yushenkov said the main reason stated -- to disarm groups of armed bandits -- was a hoax.</p>
        <p>"There are no armed gangs in Chechnya," he said (although even most critics of the war disagree), "just people driven to take up arms for their freedom. What the Russian Government has done there is a lie."</p>
        <p>It is not unusual for governments to lie in wartime, but Russian propaganda has reached a level unseen since the height of the Cold War. As Russian warplanes bombed civilian targets in the Chechen capital again today, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was saying at a news conference in New Delhi that only military targets had been attacked.</p>
        <p>And despite Moscow's efforts to jam news satellite transmissions from the region, the fact that bombs are dropping nearly every 20 minutes on Grozny is now clear to the Russian public. The headlines of the major newspapers today spoke of the bombing of innocent civilians, and interviews with Russian soldiers made it clear that this a war that few of them support.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Yeltsin accedes to Chechnya's clamor for independence, he will risk facing similar battles in other regions.</p>
        <p>There were reports today, later retracted, that Defense Minister Gen. Pavel S. Grachev had resigned. But there are reports almost every day that senior military leaders are in open revolt or ready to quit.</p>
        <p>Modern Russia has become a country where a leading military figure, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, could say -- as he did in an interview this week -- that he would be glad to take his troops to the front, as long as they included the children of the President or the Prime Minister.</p>
