        <p>Throughout the history of major league baseball, only 16 players have hit at least 245 home runs before their 30th birthdays. All are in the Hall of Fame with the exception of those still active. Eddie Murray. Jose Canseco. And, until last week, Darryl Strawberry.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, baseball's troubled prodigal son, the player with so much potential, so many demons, is no longer active, nor is he a Hall of Famer. The player who admitted to having a substance abuse problem last month was given his unconditional release by the Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday.</p>

        <p>Throughout the history of major league baseball, only 16 players have hit at least 245 home runs before their 30th birthdays. All are in the Hall of Fame with the exception of those still active. Eddie Murray. Jose Canseco. And, until last week, Darryl Strawberry.</p>
        <p>Strawberry, baseball's troubled prodigal son, the player with so much potential, so many demons, is no longer active, nor is he a Hall of Famer. The player who admitted to having a substance abuse problem last month was given his unconditional release by the Los Angeles Dodgers Wednesday.</p>
        <p>When he completes a rehabilitation program, Strawberry, the ex-Met who propelled a championship drive at Shea Stadium in 1986, most likely will try to find one more team. He left the Mets a bitter man and the team gladly said goodbye. When he left the Dodgers, it was the team that was embittered, by Strawberry's failures on and off the field.</p>
        <p>Strawberry's talents can yet win him millions and a place in the Hall of Fame, but they cannot always transcend a player's own bent for self-destruction. Just ask Pete Rose, the game's all-time hits leader who is banned from Cooperstown because of gambling.</p>
        <p>The 32-year-old Strawberry is certain he will not only be in a major league uniform next season but be a major factor. As the home runs show, very few players on the field could keep Strawberry from thriving. Only he could, and did. Now, only he will determine whether his career is over forever. CLAIRE SMITH</p>
