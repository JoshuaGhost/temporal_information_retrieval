        <p>Since 1984, the City and Suburban York Avenue Estate, a 14-building complex on the Upper East Side, has been the scene of a bitter dispute over tenant rights, development interests and historic preservation.</p>
        <p>The final chapter was played out last month when four buildings were bought by 78/79 York Associates of Mount Vernon, N.Y., a development partnership, in a bankruptcy reorganization; it acquired the others last August at a foreclosure auction.</p>
        <p>The buildings -- which from 1901 to 1913 made up the world's largest low-income housing project -- had previously been owned by the developer Peter Kalikow, who paid about $43 million for them in 1984.</p>
        <p>"We paid $18 million for the first phase and $13 million for the second," said Alan Wasserman, a partner with 78/79 York Associates.</p>
        <p>Shortly after Mr. Kalikow bought the complex, between 78th and 79th Streets, he announced plans to raze four buildings and put up four apartment towers. Opposed by the tenants, neighborhood groups and city officials, he postponed demolition.</p>
        <p>In 1990, the City Landmarks Preservation Commission further blocked his plans by designating the complex a historic landmark. The city's Board of Estimate, however, voted in 1991 to strip four buildings of landmark status, letting the developer proceed with one new apartment tower. That decision, though, was blocked by a New York State appeals court.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wasserman said he bought the units because they would give his partnership, which owns and manages several buildings in the Bronx and upper Manhattan, a stronger foothold in Manhattan. He said the partnership planned to renovate and lease the apartments.</p>
        <p>About 100 tenants live in the four buildings bought in April; 1,200 to 1,500 live in the 950 apartments in the 10 buildings bought last summer.</p>
        <p>Loretta V. Ponticello, a tenant for 39 years, said the new owner was the first "that has shown an interest in the building as a landmark and is willing to listen, to meet with us and discuss our problems."</p>
