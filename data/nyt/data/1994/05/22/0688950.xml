        <p>TONY VACCARO was sent to Europe as an infantryman in World War II. As an amateur photographer, he carried his camera along to the front lines.</p>
        <p>The photographs he took there, many of which appeared in Stars and Stripes, the military newspaper, started him on a career that took him into the upper reaches of photojournalism.</p>
        <p>Beginning on Thursday, an exhibition of his early work, called "A Young Man's Odyssey Through World War II," will be on display at the Queens Central Library. One of his photographs (at right) shows a G.I. kneeling to kiss a child in St.-Briac-sur-Mer, France, after the town's liberation by the Allies. It has been chosen for use in the D-Day 50th anniversary celebrations in France this year. Other photos on display show views of boot camp and the ruins of postwar Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vaccaro, who is now 72, has been a photographer for Look, Life, Venture and Flair magazines. He retired in 1970, but returned to Europe this year on assignment for a French magazine.</p>
        <p>Queens Central Library, 89-11 Merrick Boulevard, Jamaica; Thursday through June 30, Monday to Friday 10 A.M. to 9 P.M., Saturday 10 A.M. to 5:30 P.M.; free; (718) 990-0781.  PLAYING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD: JAMAICA</p>
