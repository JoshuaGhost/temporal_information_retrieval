        <p>PRESIDENT CLINTON went to a white-tie dinner for arts patrons on Wednesday evening and urged them to continue to support the arts at a time when the budget deficit is restricting the availability of Federal funds.</p>
        <p>In conveying his message, he even had glowing things to say about Republicans, especially WALTER H. ANNENBERG, the billionaire philanthropist, and his wife, LEONORE.</p>
        <p>At the dinner, which was held in memory of Andrew W. Mellon, the founder of the National Gallery of Art and the Secretary of the Treasury in the Harding Administration, the President praised the Annenbergs for what he called their "astonishing generosity."</p>
        <p>The Annenbergs are close friends of former President Ronald Reagan, who named Mrs. Annenberg his chief of protocol, and of the late former President Richard M. Nixon, who appointed Mr. Annenberg Ambassador to Britain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also praised Mr. Mellon, a noted Republican of his day, who died in 1937. "He represented the best tradition of service to others," he said to an illustrious crowd that included the Annenbergs as well as Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court, Henry Luce 3d, Georges and Lois de Menil, Vernon E. Jordan and Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley.</p>
        <p>"We will continue to do what we can to support the arts," Mr. Clinton said but added that the nation sorely needed private donors like the Annenbergs and the Mellons. NADINE BROZAN</p>
