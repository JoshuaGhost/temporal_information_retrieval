        <p>Ice Cube is not a teacher ("Generation Rap," April 3). A teacher, a true one, gives out new information that helps you to grow and develop. He or she does not spit back at you the venom that keeps you in your state of oppression and ignorance. Q-Tip, of the rap group Tribe Called Quest, has a rap called "Sucka' Nigga," which speaks of the derivation of the term "nigga," how it is now used and the implications of its employment. He talks about how the term prevents growth and admits the trouble he has in removing the word from his own vocabulary. But he is not validating or perpetrating its use and, in fact, gives it a new meaning. That is education. I'm not saying that all rap should preach, but calling Ice Cube a teacher is misrepresentation. He may in fact be "growing" and I'm happy to see his "evolution," but the term teacher connotes so much more. ZUHAIRAH KHALDUN New York, N.Y.</p>
