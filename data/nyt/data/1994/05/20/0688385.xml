        <p>The currency has lost half its value, the southeast of the country is in the grip of an armed rebellion, and a militant Islamic party captured 19 percent of the vote in the last elections.</p>
        <p>Turkey, which wants to show that a Western-oriented, secular society can succeed in the Muslim world, is facing a deep crisis, and the Government of Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, the first woman in the job, is hanging on largely because no other party or candidate wants to take on the thankless task.</p>
        <p>High-level Turkish officials and ambassadors of allied countries agree that public trust has vanished with the deepening financial crisis. "No one has confidence in the Government," a European envoy said. "Even high officials tell us if the Government doesn't change, nothing will get done."</p>
        <p>Husamettin Cindoruk, Speaker of the Parliament and a leader in Mrs. Ciller's True Path Party, acknowledged the lack of confidence but said Parliament would not act to bring down the Government. Opposition Prefers Opposing</p>
        <p>The main opposition, the Motherland Party, prefers remaining in opposition. One of its leaders, former Deputy Premier Mehmet Kececiler, said: "The Motherland Party wants to be in Government, but it's not logical. We would lose politically because of the problems."</p>
        <p>The financial crisis came upon Turkey suddenly in January. "I'm looking for anyone who will explain the economic reason for it," President Suleyman Demirel said in an interview. "It's just psychological."</p>
        <p>Prof. Emre Gonensay, Mr. Demirel's economic adviser and longtime colleague of the Prime Minister, added, "Turkey has been living beyond her means for the last 10 or so years." The ingredients for crisis included an overvalued currency, trade and current-account deficits, a foreign debt of $68 billion and an annual inflation rate of 50 percent to 70 percent. Interest Rates Lowered</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Ciller lowered the high interest rates she had favored earlier, it set off a rush into foreign currencies that left the Government unable to raise funds through public borrowing. Tax collection is low.</p>
        <p>"Now the state has to steal from its own institutions, like the post office, to meet its payroll," a European ambassador said. "It can't borrow."</p>
        <p>Government and party leaders attribute the election success of the Welfare Party, a Muslim militant group, largely to the poor economic situation. They insist that the party is loyal to Turkey's secular ideology and that many of its votes were protests that in the past went to extreme left-wing parties.</p>
        <p>The view is not shared by many Western diplomats. A European ambassador described the Muslim militant surge as a serious, long-term danger arising from the discrediting of the mainstream parties and the demographic upheaval of the last two decades that has brought masses of rural families of fundamentalist Islamic views into the cities.</p>
        <p>Turkish and foreign analysts describe the migrants as disoriented slum dwellers, alienated by urban life and easy prey for the Welfare Party's fundamentalist appeal.</p>
        <p>"They want an Islamic state," a diplomat said, "but they hide their goals very effectively."</p>
        <p>Abdullah Gul, one of the party's parliamentary leaders, denied that his was a specifically Muslim party. He said the introduction of Islamic law in Turkey "should be discussed," but he added that Islamic practices like the cutting off of thieves' hands was not possible in Turkey, that his party had no right to ban liquor, and that women should take an active part in society.</p>
        <p>The Welfare Party received strong support in southeast Turkey, where most of the country's estimated 12 million Kurds live and where a 10-year-old insurgency by the Kurdish Workers Party has cost Turkey dearly in the 10 months since Mrs. Ciller gave the military a free hand to try to end it. Rebels Withdraw to Mountains</p>
        <p>The offensive has driven the rebels, whose armed strength is estimated between 10,000 and 30,000, to withdraw deep into the mountains and across the border to bases in Syria, Iran and northern Iraq.</p>
        <p>This retreat has given the Government forces the initiative. Village populations that do not support the Government and enroll their men in a militia called "village guards" are routinely driven out, and many of their houses burned down.</p>
        <p>In its annual report for 1993, the Human Rights Association named 599 villages as being "depopulated and ruined." Human rights concerns are among the issues raised in opposition to Turkey's candidacy for membership in the European Union.</p>
        <p>A diplomat said that blunt military action against civilians has resulted in much of the population sympathizing with, if not necessarily aiding, the least destructive force, the rebels. Estimates of Dead Vary</p>
        <p>Estimates of the number of people killed since 1984 -- combatants and civilians -- range from 11,000 to 20,000. The higher figure is an estimate offered by Remzi Kartal, Member of Parliament and acting chairman of the Democratic Party, a largely Kurdish group.</p>
        <p>Most diplomats judge both sides in the fighting severely. A European ambassador described the rebel campaign as "vicious, mindless terrorism" and accused the Government of "a totalitarian mindset."</p>
        <p>The war atmosphere, with the southeast living under emergency rule that suspends many rights, has led to accusations of executions without trial, widespread disappearances and arbitrary arrests, as well as torture at the hand of security forces.</p>
        <p>The Government issues routine, general denials of human rights violations. "If I am here, that means that in this country nothing will happen inhuman," Mr. Demirel said.</p>
