        <p>Police Commissioner William Bratton continues to react intelligently, instead of defensively, to allegations of police brutality. For that he deserves the gratitude of all New Yorkers, especially in view of the disturbing accounts from witnesses to the arrest of Ernest Sayon, the Staten Island man who died recently in a struggle with police. Without in any way judging the behavior of the police officers, Mr. Bratton has ordered a review of his department's policies and training programs for handling violent suspects.</p>
        <p>That is a sound move on the merits and in community relations. New Yorkers must be confident that their police officers -- particularly their police chief -- reject violent, abusive behavior. The tendency for officers to protect each other is a strong one. Mr. Bratton sends the message that his strong defense of the police force does not extend to the unnecessary use of violence. Yet he also shows understanding for his police officers, who need better training to avoid injury themselves while subduing violent suspects.</p>

        <p>Police Commissioner William Bratton continues to react intelligently, instead of defensively, to allegations of police brutality. For that he deserves the gratitude of all New Yorkers, especially in view of the disturbing accounts from witnesses to the arrest of Ernest Sayon, the Staten Island man who died recently in a struggle with police. Without in any way judging the behavior of the police officers, Mr. Bratton has ordered a review of his department's policies and training programs for handling violent suspects.</p>
        <p>That is a sound move on the merits and in community relations. New Yorkers must be confident that their police officers -- particularly their police chief -- reject violent, abusive behavior. The tendency for officers to protect each other is a strong one. Mr. Bratton sends the message that his strong defense of the police force does not extend to the unnecessary use of violence. Yet he also shows understanding for his police officers, who need better training to avoid injury themselves while subduing violent suspects.</p>
        <p>Authorities have not established that the police used inappropriate force in subduing Mr. Sayon. The city's medical examiner found that Mr. Sayon's death was a homicide, and that he died of the combined effects of a struggle with police and the impairment of his breathing. A grand jury is weighing whether the police action was criminal.</p>
        <p>It is not yet clear whether Mr. Sayon died of a choke hold -- a technique banned in New York City, that involves grabbing someone around the neck from behind and squeezing. The medical examiner's autopsy found that Mr. Sayon died of pressure applied to his chest and neck while he lay face down, his hands cuffed behind him.</p>
        <p>Either way, the circumstances raise questions about police preparedness. Mr. Bratton rightly asks: Have police officers been adequately trained in alternate techniques for restraining violent suspects? The answer is apparently no. That is a serious deficiency because, as the Commissioner noted, in a too-violent city, it has become commonplace for suspects to resist arrest.</p>
        <p>Nine years ago Benjamin Ward, then the city's Police Commissioner, issued an order limiting the use of choke holds, but there were exceptions: for instance, officers could use a choke hold when their lives were in danger and the choke hold was the "least dangerous" alternative. Last October Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly banned all choke holds without exception.</p>
        <p>But the department failed to prescribe new, practical alternatives or train officers in their use. So Mr. Bratton will appoint a task force to propose acceptable methods of restraining violent suspects, the equipment and tactics used, and how best to train and retrain officers and recruits. That is sophisticated and sensitive policing, which can help both police officers and the public they serve.</p>
