        <p>At 7:45 on an early spring morning, the 1,600 students at Roosevelt High School were startled by the sudden appearance of this city's Mayor, Terence M. Zaleski. It was not a friendly visit.</p>
        <p>The Mayor, accompanied by a cadre of police officers armed with portable metal detectors, stormed onto the school grounds in what he said was an attempt to restore order, one day after a student had been stabbed in a school hallway. But like many others there, Liz Smith, the co-president of the senior class at Roosevelt, saw the Mayor's unannounced visit as unnecessary and self-serving.</p>
        <p>"He wanted to use our school," Ms. Smith, 18, said. "If he was really concerned, he would check up on us more often."</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaleski's temporary takeover of security at this city's largest high school -- an action that was halted by a State Supreme Court judge's order several hours later -- raised serious questions about how well the state's fifth-largest school district is coping with violence in its classrooms and corridors. But it has also inflamed the already tense relationship between the Mayor and this city's Board of Education. Last year, for example, the two sides were unable to settle a dispute over the school budget until a Federal judge intervened. School Board Opposition</p>
        <p>In part, the frayed relationship has resulted from Mr. Zaleski's frustrated attempts to gain control of the board: while the Mayor appoints the board's nine members, they serve staggered, five-year terms, meaning no more than two seats expire each year. Until last week, a majority of the board members -- six -- were appointees of mayors who served before Mr. Zaleski took office in 1992.</p>
        <p>The board opposes the use of metal detectors, arguing that they would make the schools feel like armed camps. Several board members have characterized Mr. Zaleski's action at Roosevelt as a dramatic "photo opportunity," engineered to win public sympathy and political leverage for his proposed $215 million school budget for the next fiscal year -- $20 million shy of what the school superintendent has requested.</p>
        <p>"What he did that day was a power play to show that he, as Mayor, could do whatever he wanted," said Kathleen LaMorte, a board member whose five-year term expired last week and a sharp critic of Mr. Zaleski. "He wanted to force the board to go his way with the budget."</p>
        <p>But in a one-hour conversation in his City Hall office, the Mayor dismissed such criticism as "Board of Education spin" and maintained that politics was not a factor in his decision to descend on Roosevelt without alerting the school principal or the superintendent. Instead, he and his aides said, four violent incidents at Roosevelt over six weeks -- the stabbing, in which a 19-year-old student was critically injured, was the latest and most serious -- left him feeling exasperated and frightened.</p>
        <p>"I did what I did because it was the right thing to do for the children," said Mr. Zaleski, a former chemistry teacher who has been more willing than his mayoral predecessors to comply with a Federal order to integrate housing in this racially splintered city. "This was done sincerely from the heart."</p>
        <p>But an overwhelming number of students interviewed at Roosevelt said they had been unnerved by the Mayor's presence, which they characterized as irresponsibly fanning the flames of fear.</p>
        <p>"That made us feel unsafe," said Jeanette Torres, a 15-year-old sophomore. "It made us tense." Told of such comments, Mr. Zaleski responded by reading from a sheaf of supportive phone messages and letters that he said he had received from people across the community.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the Yonkers public schools are safer than many of their counterparts in New York City. Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx, for example, reported 51 violent incidents last year, the highest of any school in New York City and more than all 34 Yonkers schools combined. Nevertheless, Yonkers police statistics indicate that violence is on the rise in the schools and in the entire community, which saw a 4.5 percent increase in major crimes, including murder and rape, last year.</p>
        <p>From September 1992 until June 1993, the Yonkers police investigated 21 assaults in the schools, 5 of which involved a knife or a box cutter, a long razor blade protected by a plastic sleeve. Through April 1 of the current school year, the police had already investigated 24 assaults, 11 of them involving knives or box cutters.</p>
        <p>Among the most serious recent incidents, the police said, were a 19-year-old female student striking the Roosevelt principal, Michael Yazurlo, in the head with a bottle of Snapple and a 16-year-old student brandishing a .25-caliber, semiautomatic weapon in the school cafeteria before being wrestled to the ground by school monitors. Last week, a 17-year-old student at Gorton High School was charged with trying to rape a 15-year-old student in a classroom after the school day had ended.</p>
        <p>Education and law-enforcement officials said they were hard-pressed to explain why the schools were becoming more violent, other than that it was a reflection of the city as a whole. "I don't think you could say it is related to gangs or drugs," said Sgt. Lorenzo Paul, supervisor of the community affairs division of the Yonkers police. "A lot of the violence is perpetrated by kids who are just carrying weapons to protect themselves."</p>
        <p>While no one disagrees with the Mayor's goal of reducing the violence, he has had difficulty selling his solutions, including the use of metal detectors, to a reluctant board.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zaleski -- who along with the City Council has authority over the amount allocated for schools but no say over day-to-day spending -- has run into similar roadblocks on other issues over the last two years, failing to persuade the board, for example, to create a separate high school for gifted and talented children or an alternative school for children with severe disciplinary problems.</p>
        <p>At Roosevelt, the principal, Dr. Yazurlo, said he hoped Mr. Zaleski would follow up his visit with more resources to hire guidance counselors, reduce class sizes and expand conflict-resolution programs. But he chided Mr. Zaleski for having singled out his school's discipline problems without citing its strengths, like the 40 nationalities represented in its student body or the 78 percent of its seniors who go on to four-year colleges.</p>
        <p>"Ninety-eight or ninety-nine percent of the students are being represented by one or two percent in a negative way," Dr. Yazurlo said.</p>
        <p>Still, Roosevelt can at times be frightening. Students say it is not uncommon to see someone carrying a box cutter for protection. And during a recent lunch break, a student sat on a cement barrier outside the school building, mindlessly twirling a razor blade in his teeth.</p>
        <p>"When that stabbing happened, I felt really scared and unsafe," said Madeline Ruiz, an 18-year-old junior. But she said she opposes installing metal detectors, saying they would further heighten the atmosphere of fear.</p>
        <p>"This is a school," she said, "not a prison."</p>
