        <p>DAVID AMRAM , the composer and musician, believes that it is about time to revise the image of the Beat Generation as shiftless, drug-using wanderers.</p>
        <p>"To an extent, we were surrounded by drugs and alcohol, and while that was part of many people's lives, most of us were simply trying to be artists," said Mr. Amram, an integral member of the beat movement in the late 1950's.</p>

        <p>DAVID AMRAM , the composer and musician, believes that it is about time to revise the image of the Beat Generation as shiftless, drug-using wanderers.</p>
        <p>"To an extent, we were surrounded by drugs and alcohol, and while that was part of many people's lives, most of us were simply trying to be artists," said Mr. Amram, an integral member of the beat movement in the late 1950's.</p>
        <p>"We had day jobs and stayed up all night working on our art," he said. "We didn't have the financial means or the time to become heavily involved, and we couldn't afford the expense -- or the hangover the next day. Our biggest problem was finding time to sleep."</p>
        <p>Mr. Amram and other leaders of the Beat Generation intend to set the record straight at a conference this week sponsored by the New York University School of Education. Tomorrow, Mr. Amram will recreate the jazz-poetry reading he did in 1957 with Jack Kerouac at a performance entitled, "Keeping the Flame Alive," at the Loeb Student Center.</p>
        <p>"We were multicultural 40 years before the term existed," Mr. Amram said. "We were, and still are, cantankerous, individualistic and unpredictable, while also being friendly, fun loving and hard working." NADINE BROZAN</p>
