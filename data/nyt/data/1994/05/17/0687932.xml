        <p>Over the course of "Volcano Songs," Meredith Monk celebrates the mysteries of life, aging, death, rebirth, creation and transformation. These are mighty topics, each worth an epic. Yet on Wednesday night at Performance Space 122, this new solo lasted less than an hour. Because Ms. Monk is equally gifted as composer, singer, dancer and choreographer, her multimedia piece was rich in significance.</p>
        <p>When the audience entered the building, it was ushered into a room on the first floor to contemplate what the program notes called "Shrine Installation." This proved to be a set of screens on which were projected video images of plants, staring faces and bubbling lava. Then, in the second-floor theater, Ms. Monk made it easy to believe that the whole world is a divine volcano eternally erupting with forms of life.</p>

        <p>Over the course of "Volcano Songs," Meredith Monk celebrates the mysteries of life, aging, death, rebirth, creation and transformation. These are mighty topics, each worth an epic. Yet on Wednesday night at Performance Space 122, this new solo lasted less than an hour. Because Ms. Monk is equally gifted as composer, singer, dancer and choreographer, her multimedia piece was rich in significance.</p>
        <p>When the audience entered the building, it was ushered into a room on the first floor to contemplate what the program notes called "Shrine Installation." This proved to be a set of screens on which were projected video images of plants, staring faces and bubbling lava. Then, in the second-floor theater, Ms. Monk made it easy to believe that the whole world is a divine volcano eternally erupting with forms of life.</p>
        <p>There were more video images of faces, but Ms. Monk's performance dominated the proceedings. Wearing a drab black dress and black boots, she stood on a red cloth. Paul Krajniak and Debby Lee Cohen, who collaborated with her in designing the production, made this simple piece of fabric seem the floor of a sacred place.</p>
        <p>At first, Ms. Monk's face was totally blank. Then it grew radiant, as she sang a wordless tune. When her voice turned stern, she looked determined. When she muttered in a low register, she resembled a hearty peasant. High notes transformed her into a wide-eyed young woman.</p>
        <p>Through only a few gestures and vocal changes, she went from childhood to old age and back to youth. At various times, she was mother, crone and goddess. There were moments when she could have been a cheerful flapper of the 1920's doing the Charleston. She donned enormous gloves and raised her arms triumphantly. She appeared to wade through an unseen swamp. With these perpetual metamorphoses, often accompanied by volcanolike electronic rumblings, Ms. Monk was surely honoring everyone who ever trod this earth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Monk calls "Volcano Songs" a work in progress, but it is difficult to imagine how it could be bettered.</p>
