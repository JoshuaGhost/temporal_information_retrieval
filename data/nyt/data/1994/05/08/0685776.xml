        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her otherwise fine essay "I, the Jury: Why This Novelist Can't Resist a Good Book Panel" (April 10), Diane Johnson concludes with a swat at writers of oral histories. She says there seems to be "in this technique an almost cowardly reluctance to think."</p>
        <p>As a writer of oral history ("Life and Death: The Story of a Hospital"), I was surprised and perplexed by this comment. I am not sure what the adjective "cowardly" is supposed to mean, but I certainly understand the words "reluctance to think."</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson is greatly mistaken if she believes an oral historian need only take a tape recorder into the field and engage in a bit of questioning with some willing subjects. In the early planning stages, I (and, I'm sure, others who write in this genre) spend months doing nothing but thinking -- first, about what I want the book to say, and second, about who, precisely, are the people best equipped to say it. I then must find these people and persuade them to recount their thoughts and their dreams to a stranger with a tape recorder.</p>
        <p>Once the subject agrees, each interview requires hours of homework in preparation. As a writer of nonfiction, Ms. Johnson herself must know the worst thing an interviewer can do is walk into an interview without a number of specific and thought-provoking questions.</p>
        <p>Then, too, sometimes even the best-researched questions don't work. I have spent more time than I want to recall waiting patiently while someone relates anecdote after inapplicable anecdote, because I know there is an important story there. When that happens, you end up listening intently while mentally scrambling in an effort to frame yet another question that might elicit just what you want. But oh, the joy when it finally comes.
