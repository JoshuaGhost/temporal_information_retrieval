        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>After reading Floyd Norris's "In a Cliffhanger, a Junk Deal Is Finally Sold" (Market Watch, April 17), I wasn't sure whether I should be concerned, confused or bemused. The column dealt with the recent turmoil and prevailing weakness in the bond markets and used the $550 million Thrifty-Payless deal as an example of the difficulties of such transactions in a volatile market. The successful completion of this transaction validates the intrinsic strength of the combined businesses and confirms the credit quality that made the deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norris criticizes us for taking out $88 million in cash from the merged company "long before it is clear" whether Thrifty, our original acquisition in 1992, has turned around. I would suggest that taking the company from a $256 million loss the year before its acquisition to a $75 million operating profit might legitimately be characterized as a turnaround. Furthermore, the $88 million came from more than $140 million of excess cash that has been generated. What do our investors get? Some cash, stock, bonds and a 52 percent ownership in the second-largest drug chain in the country. Since this represents a value of some $450 million to $500 million on the original $50 million we paid for Thrifty, we believe our investors have reason to cheer.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Norris characterized my record as "mixed." I have completed 22 transactions in 25 years. These investment have included companies like Budget Rent-a-Car, Horace Mann, Carr-Gottstein and Rival, successfully spanning a range of industries from gold mining to insurance to retailing. I would be the first to admit that my record is not perfect. However, I believe that an average annual internal rate of return to date in excess of 100 percent on all the investments made by Green Equity Investors L.P., Leonard Green &amp; Partners' first fund, is pretty good. At least that's what our investors say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norris never tried to contact me or anyone at my firm to respond to his column. We would have been happy to speak with him about it. Perhaps he would be better served in the future if he attempted to verify his account before publication. LEONARD I. GREEN Los Angeles, April 29 The writer is general partner of Leonard Green &amp; Partners.</p>
