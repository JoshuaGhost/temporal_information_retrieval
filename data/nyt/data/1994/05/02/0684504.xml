        <p>Little more than a decade after the United States invaded Grenada, ousting a left-wing Government that Ronald Reagan said was turning the tiny Caribbean island into an outpost of Fidel Castro's Cuba, the Clinton Administration plans to close its Embassy there to save money.</p>
        <p>With the end of the cold war, the Administration has decided that the island, which recently resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba, is of little strategic importance.</p>
        <p>"This action is to be taken only in response to budgetary pressures and in no way reflects on Grenadian-American relations or on the commitment of the United States Government to our friends in the region," the State Department said when it announced the closing recently.</p>
        <p>The island's dwindling significance today is in marked contrast to how it was described on Oct. 25, 1983, when Mr. Reagan sent 7,000 troops to end political violence and, he said, to rescue American students at St. George's University Medical School.</p>
        <p>The State Department told Congress last month of its intention to shut the modest Embassy compound and transfer its functions to the Embassy in Barbados, 150 miles to the northeast. The Embassy in Barbados had responsibility for Grenada until just after the 1983 invasion.</p>
        <p>State Department officials said on Friday that closing the Embassy in Grenada, as well as the one in Antigua and a regional office of the Agency for International Development in Barbados, is part of an effort to shift resources to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Congress, which can overrule the State Department, has until May 13 to decide if it wants to keep the Embassies open. Grenadian officials are lobbying members of Congress and the Administration for a reprieve.</p>
        <p>"Because of the special relationship that exists between our two countries, Grenadians would feel terribly let down if the American Embassy were to close its doors in St. George's," Prime Minister Nicholas A. Braithwaite wrote to President Clinton on April 22.  The Lobbying Begins</p>
        <p>Representative Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat who is head of the Congressional Black Caucus Task Force on the Caribbean, has also asked Mr. Clinton to reconsider the decision.</p>
        <p>State Department officials are waiting to see if any groundswell emerges in Congress that will stay their hand. "You know how these things go," said a State Department official. "It ain't over till it's over."</p>
        <p>Mr. Payne's office said 1,500 Americans are in Grenada at any given time: tourists, business executives, retirees -- and about 500 students at the medical school, which reopened after the invasion.</p>
        <p>A lush, hilly island 90 miles north of Venezuela, Grenada has been declining in importance as a diplomatic post. There are only two Americans assigned to the Embassy.</p>
        <p>State Department budget-cutters considered closing the Embassy last year but decided that to do so in the year marking the 10th anniversary of an invasion intended to "liberate" Grenada from Communism would have been poor public relations.</p>
        <p>"It would have looked odd to close it within a few years of the operation," said State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "But it was becoming harder to justify keeping it open. It's really not an active post in terms of any of the normal criteria: political and economic reporting, narcotics or consular affairs." 19 Americans Died</p>
        <p>The invasion in 1983 led to the deaths of 19 American soldiers and sailors, 110 Grenadian militia and 71 Cubans, many of whom were armed construction workers with no formal military training.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan explained the invasion of the 133-square-mile island, which has a population of 85,000, by saying that Cuba was turning the country into an outpost of Soviet expansionism and that an airstrip was being built that could be used by Russian warplanes. A month ago, on April 4, Mr. Braithwaite's Government announced it was re-establishing diplomatic relations with Cuba, which were broken at the time of the United States invasion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan used the success of the invasion -- the troops secured the island in two days -- to proclaim the primacy of United States fighting forces, whose image and morale had been battered by the defeat in Vietnam and by the disastrous attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran three years earlier. The Pentagon awarded 9,802 decorations after the invasion, including 813 Bronze Stars.</p>
        <p>"Our days of weakness are over," Mr. Reagan said, alluding to the invasion. "Our military forces are standing tall."</p>
        <p>But declassified Defense Department documents later showed that the invasion suffered from poor planning and a lack of equipment. At one point, because ground troops and the Navy's shipboard command had incompatible radios, an Army officer had to use his personal credit card to telephone his office in North Carolina to coordinate Naval air support.</p>
        <p>The documents also noted that the medical students were not in danger.</p>
