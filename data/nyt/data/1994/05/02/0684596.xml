        <p>Sherri Steinhauer birdied two of the last four holes today to hold off a charging Kelly Robbins and win the $1.2 million Sprint Championship, the richest prize in women's golf, at Indigo Lakes Resort.</p>
        <p>Steinhauer, 31, from Madison, Wis., scored her second career victory by making two critical putts when the heat was on. Leading Robbins, who had a tap-in putt for birdie, by a stroke at the 15th hole, Steinhauer drained a 20-footer for birdie. She followed that with an 18-footer for birdie at the 16th hole and then parred in for a round of 70, a 72-hole total of 15-under-par 273 and a one-stroke victory over Robbins, who closed with 68.</p>

        <p>The check for $180,000 is the largest of Steinhauer's eight-year career. It is, in fact, more than her season earnings in all but three of those eight years.</p>
        <p>"I managed not to think about the money," Steinhauer said. "All day long my mind was a tape recorder. Whenever I felt I was getting ahead of myself, I'd reverse the tape."</p>
