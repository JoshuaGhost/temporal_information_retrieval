        <p>Some have been orchestrated with military precision. Others have been unpredictable free-for-alls. But this year's Republican Party state convention promises to be a little of both.</p>
        <p>The Republican State Committee will meet in New York City beginning today to select candidates for statewide offices. And while party leaders have been hustling behind the scenes to line up a ticket, it remains far from clear who will be on the ballot when the votes are all counted.</p>
        <p>Here is a look at the committee and how its choices will be made. The Committee</p>
        <p>The primary role of the 394 state committee members is to select candidates for statewide offices: governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, comptroller and United States senator.</p>
        <p>The committee members are elected for two-year terms by Republican voters, though most run unopposed. In general, there are two committee members from each State Assembly district, and state law requires that one be a woman and one a man.</p>
        <p>Their votes are weighted according to how many Republican votes were cast from a committee member's district in the previous statewide election. Thus, heavily Republican districts have heavier votes.</p>
        <p>One result of weighted voting is that the party chairmen of large Republican counties -- Nassau and Suffolk in particular -- control the largest blocks of votes. The Prize</p>
        <p>The candidate who wins more than 50 percent of the committee members' votes becomes the party's designee. But candidates who win 25 percent of the vote on any ballot will also be allowed to challenge the designee in the primary.</p>
        <p>Candidates who do not win 25 percent can still get on the ballot by circulating petitions, a process that is time-consuming, costly and usually subject to court challenge. To qualify by petition, a candidate must collect the signatures of 15,000 registered Republican voters between June 7 and July 14. In addition, the candidate must obtain 100 signatures or more from at least 16 of the state's 32 Congressional districts.  The Candidates</p>
        <p>GOVERNOR The preconvention favorite for governor is State Senator George E. Pataki, a lawyer and former Peekskill Mayor who has the support of the party's most powerful patron, Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. But three other candidates are vying to get 25 percent of the vote and a place on the primary ballot: Herbert London, a professor at New York University; Evan G. Galbraith, a businessman and former Ambassador to France, and Bill Green, a former Representative from Manhattan. A fifth candidate, Richard M. Rosenbaum, a lawyer and former state party chairman, has decided to attempt to get on the ballot by petition.</p>
        <p>LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR There are no announced candidates, but it is possible that one of the gubernatorial candidates will accept the position. It has been rumored that J. Patrick Barrett, a businessman and former state party chairman, was being drafted for the job, but Mr. Barrett's aides have said he does not want it.</p>
        <p>COMPTROLLER State Assemblyman John J. Faso of Kinderhook is considered the leading contender. He is being challenged by the Suffolk County Comptroller, Joseph R. Caputo. It is also possible that one of the unsuccessful gubernatorial candidates will seek the position.</p>
        <p>ATTORNEY GENERAL There are two announced candidates, neither of whom is a clear front-runner: Dennis C. Vacco, a former United States Attorney in Buffalo, and Joseph Holland, a Manhattan businessman and lawyer.</p>
        <p>SENATOR There are two announced candidates: Bernadette Castro, whose family is best known for making convertible sofas, and Henry Hewes, a Manhattan businessman and former Right to Life candidate for mayor of New York City.</p>
