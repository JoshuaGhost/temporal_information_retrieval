        <p>As many as 40 New York City schools that have shown a steady decline in academic performance could face increased monitoring and a possible takeover by Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, school officials said yesterday.</p>

        <p>As many as 40 New York City schools that have shown a steady decline in academic performance could face increased monitoring and a possible takeover by Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, school officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cortines announced last month that he would intervene in the operation of six elementary and junior high schools whose leadership, he said, had permitted failure for so long that it amounted to "educational corruption." But in a report released yesterday, 34 additional schools were identified as facing possible action, in which the chancellor would more closely monitor performance, and then might ultimately replace the school's leadership if no progress is reported.</p>
        <p>"We've identified six schools that seem to be urgently in need of intervention. We believe there'll be more," said Dr. Beverly L. Hall, chief executive of instructional and student support programs for the Board of Education. "We would like to work with the local boards to bring about change. If that's not happening by December for those schools, we would more directly intervene." Improvement Expected</p>
        <p>"We don't expect a miracle," Dr. Hall said "But we expect to see some dramatic improvement."</p>
        <p>The report details the Chancellor's strategy for dealing with 100 of the city's worst schools in terms of academic performance.  Fifty-five of those schools were originally placed by the State Education Department on a list of failing schools. And in recent months, board officials identified 45 more that were performing poorly in various categories, ranging from their scores on state math and reading tests to poor attendance and high dropout rates.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Chancellor asked lawmakers in Albany to increase his powers to remove supervisors and other staff members in troubled schools. Currently, elementary and junior high school principals are hired by local school boards, and, if they do not have tenure, they can be dismissed by district superintendents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cortines's plan to intervene in the management of the troubled schools would be the most sweeping of any chancellor since the school system was decentralized in 1970, school officials have said. The law that decentralized control of the schools allows the Chancellor to intervene in local districts to stop illegality, but does not allow him to take control of local schools for their failure to educate students adequately.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hall said she believes Mr. Cortines will go forward with his plan even if Albany does not pass the legislation. "I think the Chancellor would like the legislation to clarify that he has the authority to do it," she said. "He believes that he does."</p>
        <p>The 100 schools determined to be poorly performing were divided into three groups based upon how urgently they need emergency measures to bolster their performance, Dr. Hall said. Forty schools were put in the group requiring highest priority, and of those, six were deemed in most critical need.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Cortines announced in April that he would take over those six schools, they will first undergo an intervention plan by his office, district and school officials to try and stave off such action, officials said.</p>
        <p>Starting in June, a representative of the Chancellor will visit each of the six schools every other week, helping to devise a plan to improve teacher training and instruction, Dr. Hall said. Examinations Required</p>
        <p>Schools will then be examined to see if they have demonstrated any improvement by using criteria like a review of students' work, observation of instruction methods, and performance on standardized tests, Dr. Hall said. But if a school has not improved by Dec. 20, the Chancellor would "take over" the school, which could mean replacing everyone from the principal to teachers to guidance counselors, Dr. Hall said.</p>
        <p>Community district superintendents have already said they will remove four of the principals overseeing the six schools initially cited. Though the Chancellor is not currently demanding that the principals of the other schools be removed, Dr. Hall said it would be up to the superintendents and community school boards to determine whether such a step is necessary to help improve performance and avoid a complete takeover in December.</p>
        <p>Whether the 34 schools added to the list of the city's lowest performers join the original six in requiring special attention from the Chancellor remains to be seen, Dr. Hall said. Board officials will visit half those schools by the end of June, and the other half by the end of September, at which time they will make their determinations.</p>
        <p>Bert Shanas, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers, said union officials were still studying the plan, and thus could not comment on specifics. However, he said, "often a change in leadership in a school or a change of school can make a big difference in a teacher who may be burnt out.</p>
        <p>"But teachers have certain contractual requirements when it comes to such things," he said. "And certainly we would have to ensure that any agreements don't violate any of those rights."</p>
