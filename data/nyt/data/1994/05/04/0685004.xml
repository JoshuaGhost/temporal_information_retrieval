        <p>Stocks were mixed yesterday, with the broad market mired in a narrow trading range and blue chips advancing as a result of a late flurry of computerized buying.</p>
        <p>"The stock market was driven by the bond market," said Louis Ehrenkrantz, president of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "The bond market is worried that the Fed will raise rates again and the bond market is uppermost in everybody's mind."</p>
        <p>On May 17, the Federal Reserve's policy-making council is scheduled to meet and many analysts expect another increase in short-term interest rates at that time. The Fed has already raised its short-term interest rate target, which is now 3.75 percent, three times this year.</p>
        <p>Yesterday bond prices dropped for the fourth consecutive trading session and the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which moves in the opposite direction correspondingly increased to 7.35 percent, from 7.33 percent on Monday.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 3,714.41, up 13.39 points.  "There is a general flight to industrial stocks during periods of recovery from a recession," Mr. Ehrenkrantz added. "The Dow is now leading the market."</p>
        <p>In contrast, the broader Nasdaq composite index fell 1.31 points, to 739.37 and the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks barely closed on the upside with a 0.01 point gain to 453.03. Declining stocks on the New York Stock Exchange topped advancers by 1,112 to 993. Volume totaled 288.5 million shares, down slightly from the 297.1 million shares changing hands Monday.</p>
        <p>For the second straight session, drug stocks were strong. Two major transactions were announced yesterday -- SmithKline Beecham buying the drug distribution unit of United Healthcare and Pfizer and Value Health forming a joint venture -- on the heels of the acquisition of Syntex by Roche Holding, which was announced Monday. As a result, drug companies that might participate in other consolidations rallied, including Eli Lilly, up 1 3/8, to 53, and Upjohn, up 3/8, to 28 7/8.</p>
        <p>Gains were also posted by cable stocks, fueled by heightened takeover rumors involving Time Warner, which rose 3 3/8, to 40. Among the cable companies closing on the upside were Tele-Communications A, which advanced 1 1/8, to 20 5/8, and Comcast, which increased 1 5/16 , to 17 5/16 .</p>
        <p>But interest-rate-sensitive utility stocks were weak, as evidenced by the 1.06-point decline in the Dow Jones utility average. Northern States Power fell 1/4, to 41 3/8; Duke Power fell 1/4, to 36 3/8, and Pacific Gas and Electric declined 3/4, to 25 3/8.</p>
        <p>Some of the tobacco stocks were affected adversely by a report that manufacturers could face greater liability in Florida for the cost of treating smoking-related ailments if it becomes easier for the state to recover some of its Medicaid costs. For instance, Philip Morris was off 1/2, to 53 1/2.</p>
        <p>Eastman Kodak advanced 1 3/8, to 46 1/8, after it formally announced that it will sell its pharmaceutical subsidiary and two other divisions to improve its financial performance. On Monday, Kodak rose another 3 1/4 on indications that such a divestiture would occur.</p>
        <p>However, Valence Technology, a battery-technology company, sank 4 1/4, to 5 1/4, after it announced a review of its 1992 purchase agreement with Motorola. Cobra Industries, a recreational vehicle manufacturer, declined 5/8, to 5, following a sharp drop in first-quarter profits. And TRM Copy Centers, which operates self-service photocopiers in retail stores, fell 2, to 6 3/4, also as a result of a lower earnings report.</p>
