        <p>There has to be some payback for putting up with bulldozers as the site at 67th Street and Broadway is cleared for a new apartment tower, and it is visible now, but not for long. It is a pair of signs, softly faded, painted on the side of an old brick tenement, long hidden and destined to disappear once again as soon as the tower rises out of the ground.</p>
        <p>It looks, at first, like something put there for a movie shoot, an attempt to dress up the raucous cityscape of New York and make it look like the genteel city it never really was. But these signs are an authentic remnant of an age before infomercials became the way to sell new products, and there is a sweetness to their message: "Omega Oil. For Rheumatism. Stops Pain. Trial Bottle 10¦."</p>

        <p>There has to be some payback for putting up with bulldozers as the site at 67th Street and Broadway is cleared for a new apartment tower, and it is visible now, but not for long. It is a pair of signs, softly faded, painted on the side of an old brick tenement, long hidden and destined to disappear once again as soon as the tower rises out of the ground.</p>
        <p>It looks, at first, like something put there for a movie shoot, an attempt to dress up the raucous cityscape of New York and make it look like the genteel city it never really was. But these signs are an authentic remnant of an age before infomercials became the way to sell new products, and there is a sweetness to their message: "Omega Oil. For Rheumatism. Stops Pain. Trial Bottle 10¦."</p>
        <p>The signs are three stories high, the O's a full story high themselves, in a typeface that is handsome, almost elegant. With their colors barely visible, they bespeak a hucksterism that now feels quaint, not pushy.</p>
        <p>The Omega signs' sudden, dramatic appearance in a high-profile neighborhood has made them media darlings of sorts.</p>
        <p>But the cityscape is full of such ghosts, many more long-lasting. Several of them, by virtue of falling within historic districts like TriBeCa and the Ladies Mile area along Broadway in the 20's, have de facto landmark protection, though they are not landmarks in themselves, and the Landmarks Preservation Commission has yet to veto any construction project so as to protect a ghost sign.</p>
        <p>The notion of a sign as landmark is not so farfetched: after all, the moment one loses its commercial impact, it becomes an artifact. Some signs, like the classic neon extravaganzas at Times Square, become artifacts while they are still selling tools, which is perhaps why there is so much interest these days in preserving and enhancing them: They satisfy the urbanist's historic preservation urge and make money at the same time.</p>
        <p>But the old painted signs are different from Times Square's electric brilliance: They are only relics, robbed of any commercial urgency, their potency replaced by a benign, soft presence. Not only are they not visible at night, many are so faded they are barely visible by day. But like washed denim, their faded quality is their very essence. The Omega Oil signs are far more likely to inspire a reverie about the romance of old brick walls than a rush to the drugstore.</p>
        <p>No one knows when the Omega Oil signs were painted. The tenements whose south walls hold them went up around 1886, but not long after, and certainly by 1912, buildings rose to the south, blocking any view of the signs. It's possible that they were seen for as little as a year or two before the growth of the city obscured them.</p>
        <p>More mystery surrounds the vintage sign at the northeast corner of Reade Street and West Broadway in lower Manhattan. A three-story sign on the stone facade of a somber Italianate building, it has two parts: somewhat oblique advertising copy ("Brush Up Business With Paint, Paste, Paper, Push") and a surreal image, a two-story-high hand, floating in space, holding a paintbrush. The colors are murky beige and powder blue.</p>
        <p>What does it mean? Paint and paste, yes, but "push"? And why is there no name of a paint store, or brand of paint? The sign has confounded city historians for years. According to Christopher Gray of the Office for Metropolitan History, a photograph of the building in 1940 shows no sign of this sign, though it gives every stylistic indication of being much older.</p>
        <p>A huge hand, pushing its way up the wall, must have seemed remarkable, particularly in an age when highway-size billboards were less than common. The side of a building was just about the largest canvas an advertiser could claim at modest cost, and the anonymous sign painter was determined to make the most of it.  Just-Plain-Folks Art</p>
        <p>The old signs never aspired to the level of art, but today they stand, like so much early advertising, as folk art, earnest and determined. What is all the more striking is how completely many of them have become part of the buildings on which they were painted. They are not like billboards, plunked onto or in front of buildings; they are embellishments of the facades, almost a part of the architecture.</p>
        <p>And they are among the cityscape's most endearing ghosts. There is a virtually illegible remnant of a sign on a building on lower Broadway that once housed the photographer Matthew Brady's studio, where Abraham Lincoln posed. Now just a painted wall, it once read "359 Brady's Gallery."</p>
        <p>There are numerous other ghost signs around Manhattan, particularly in downtown neighborhoods where older, lower buildings predominate. Some are of the nonpainted variety, like the Automat sign on Broadway between 35th and 36th Streets, a survivor among several that recently disappeared.</p>
        <p>But the city's most prominent ghost sign, at least of modern times, is now gone: the huge letters spelling out "Pan Am" atop 200 Park Avenue, which survived the demise of Pan American World Airways by a year or so, and even inspired a mild flutter of suggestions that the Landmarks Preservation Commission designate it the city's first official landmark sign.</p>
        <p>The Pan Am sign, almost 30 years old at the time of its removal, had become almost as much an icon of New York as the old Camels sign at Times Square or the Pearl-Wick Hampers sign on the East River in Queens, and once Pan Am had gone out of business no one could challenge the fact that the sign was a historical artifact, not a piece of advertising.</p>
        <p>At one point during the controversy a magazine asked several prominent New Yorkers whether they thought the sign should be preserved, and one architect quipped, "Keep the sign and tear down the building."</p>
