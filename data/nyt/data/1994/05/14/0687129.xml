        <p>Prices of Treasury securities ended moderately higher yesterday after a roller-coaster session that epitomized the trading activity throughout the week.</p>
        <p>The market initially rallied after the Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose a tenth of a percent in April. The increase was less than had been expected in many forecasts and was another sign that inflation was still in check.</p>
        <p>But the market was quickly tripped up by rumors that a leading Wall Street firm was in financial trouble and was selling mortgage-backed securities and Treasury issues to raise capital. Later, the rumor expanded to include at least half a dozen firms or hedge funds. Although these were only rumors, they did affect the market by raising concerns, traders said.</p>
        <p>Then Market News Service quoted a Federal Reserve governor, John P. LaWare, as saying that personal consumption, a key ingredient in the economic expansion, remained strong and that consumers were showing a growing willingness to borrow to finance purchases.</p>
        <p>For traders and investors, the comments were another indication that there was still reason for the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates again, despite the good news on inflation. But by the afternoon, the positive inflation data appeared to be winning out and giving the market a lift, as prices rose and yields fell.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond rose 20/32 , to 8510/32 , for a yield of 7.49 percent, down from 7.56 percent on Thursday and at the level of Tuesday.</p>
        <p>John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said there was no sign yet of any upward trend in price inflation. "In fact, if we look at the trend of the last few months annualized and compare it to the past 12 months, you can see that the latest data remain benign," he said. "This should help ease investor fears about inflation as a near-term risk.</p>
        <p>"However, neither should it dissuade the Fed from continuing its tightening policy. Critics who complain that the Fed is responding to inflation now, when everyone else sees none, are missing the point. Fed policy is responding to the continuing strength of economic growth, rather than some ghost of inflation."</p>
        <p>The monetary policy-making committee of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee, is scheduled to meet Tuesday, and many analysts expect the central bank to raise its short-term interest rate target by a quarter to a half of a percentage point. The target is now 3.75 percent; it has been raised three times since February by a quarter of a percentage point each time.</p>
        <p>"There are substantial reasons for a more aggressive move soon -- for example, 50 basis points," Mr. Lipsky said. "But there are also good arguments in favor of a two-step process."</p>
        <p>Some traders and dealers say that an aggressive move by the Fed of more than 25 basis points would be a golden opportunity for the central bank to get out ahead of the market and complete its work sooner.</p>
        <p>In other data released yesterday, the Commerce Department reported that inventories fell in March for the first time in three months as sales continued to rise strongly. Total business inventories decreased by two-tenths of a percent, to $869.5 billion -- the first drop since a decline of a tenth of a percent in December.</p>
