        <p>I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when reading the capsule reviews in your new guide to children's movies  [ "From Naked Guns and Fangs to Thumbelina," April 17 ] . Janet Maslin commented on the negative portrayal of Icelanders, not exactly your most maligned group, in "D2: The Mighty Ducks," but the reviewer of "Thumbelina," Patricia S. McCormick, gave not one word of warning about the prejudicial treatment of Latin Americans. The arch villains in this story are toads, all of whom the movie portrays as Latinos.</p>

        <p>I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when reading the capsule reviews in your new guide to children's movies  [ "From Naked Guns and Fangs to Thumbelina," April 17 ] . Janet Maslin commented on the negative portrayal of Icelanders, not exactly your most maligned group, in "D2: The Mighty Ducks," but the reviewer of "Thumbelina," Patricia S. McCormick, gave not one word of warning about the prejudicial treatment of Latin Americans. The arch villains in this story are toads, all of whom the movie portrays as Latinos.</p>
        <p>At a time when so much emphasis is given to teaching children about ethnic diversity, it is astonishing that a film for youngsters would have such stereotypes. Imagine the outrage that would be heard if these characters were depicted as, say, blacks or Jews. Apparently, Hollywood executives think it's O.K. to portray Latinos so poorly, and, judging from your reviewer's response, they're right.</p>
        <p>So much for concern about too much political correctness. Upon seeing "Thumbelina," as the parent of children of Latin American descent, I longed for some.  LILI HARTMAN  Maplewood, N. J.  'THUMBELINA'</p>
