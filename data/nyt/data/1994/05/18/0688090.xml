        <p>IN sunny climes, people have a simple method for making summer wine. They add cold water to the red wine they drink the rest of the year. The result: a do-it-yourself rose, light-bodied, low in alcohol and just right for a long afternoon on the shady side of a piazza.</p>
        <p>Most of us don't have it so easy. Should we choose a medium red, a light red, a white, a rose? Or maybe a blush wine, like white zinfandel?</p>

        <p>IN sunny climes, people have a simple method for making summer wine. They add cold water to the red wine they drink the rest of the year. The result: a do-it-yourself rose, light-bodied, low in alcohol and just right for a long afternoon on the shady side of a piazza.</p>
        <p>Most of us don't have it so easy. Should we choose a medium red, a light red, a white, a rose? Or maybe a blush wine, like white zinfandel?</p>
        <p>Mostly, we opt for a white. Why? Well, it looks like a summer wine. It seems to be lighter and it's always served cold, like most other summer drinks. Some people drink nothing but white wine anyway.</p>
        <p>White wine can be misleading. German rieslings can be light and refreshing; so can Frascati, the wine of the Roman suburbs, and so many of the simple, fresh, almost characterless whites served in pitchers or carafes all over Italy.</p>
        <p>The white wines of the Rhone, of Burgundy, of Alsace and of California are another matter. They can be as big and powerful as any reds. They may be good white wines or poor white wines, but there is nothing particularly summery about them.</p>
        <p>Rose may be the ideal warm-weather wine. A few, including Tavel, which comes from the region around Avignon in France and was praised by the poet Ronsard, can reach 13 percent alcohol, like a muscular California cabernet. But most hover between 11 and 12 percent and can be even lower when they are served in the places they come from.</p>
        <p>The simplest way to make rose is to blend red wine with white. Lots of cheap rose is made this way, but the practice is frowned upon and, in fact, the French ban it. Just how closely this interdiction is followed is hard to say, given the oceans of cheap rose consumed every summer along the Mediterranean from Monte Carlo to the Spanish border.</p>
        <p>Actually, the French allow the blending of red and white wine, but only for pink Champagne and sparkling wine. There is a certain irony to this process because pinot noir and pinot mounier, the principal grapes used in making Champagne, are both red.</p>
        <p>With all wine grapes, the color is in the skin; the juice is white. When the skins are separated at crushing, the wine that results is white. Usually, rose champagnes cost considerably more than white champagnes and are not worth the extra cost.</p>
        <p>The preferred way to make rose wine is to allow crushed or simply broken red grapes to macerate for 12 to 48 hours, permitting the juice to pick up color from the skins. The juice is then drained off -- not pressed out -- and fermented like a white wine. This is called bleeding or, in French, the saignee method.</p>
        <p>The remaining pulp and skins are then pressed to make a concentrated red wine. This technique can help wineries eager for cash flow. The rose can be sold off almost immediately; the red wine needs a year -- or two or three -- before it's ready.</p>
        <p>There are variations on the saignee method. Sometimes, whole bunches of red grapes are pressed lightly and added to the white juice that was drained off before fermentation. In other instances, crushed grapes and juice are fermented together for one to three days before the juice is run off. No pressing is involved.</p>
        <p>Tavel, made from grenache and cinsault grapes, may have prestige, but it is not nearly as popular as inexpensive rose de Provence or the slightly sweet, slightly carbonated Portuguese roses like Mateus, which are sold all over the world.</p>
        <p>One Provencal rose, the Chateau de Selle, from the Domaines Ott, is considered the Rolls-Royce of French roses. It is an attractive wine, but it's difficult to justify the price, which is usually slightly more than $20.</p>
        <p>After Tavel, rose d'Anjou is France's best-known rose. It comes from the Loire Valley, which has long been noted for sturdy rose wines. Jean Sauvion, who makes a variety of Loire wines, mostly white, produces a rose he calls Chateau de Beugnon, a tasty, uncomplicated wine that usually sells for a little more than $5.</p>
        <p>Georges Duboeuf, who is known principally for his Beaujolais, has ventured into the Rhone and the Midi in recent years with considerable success. One of his finds is a rose made from the syrah grape, a wine with a delicious bouquet and, for a rose, a pronounced fruity taste. It, too, sells in the range of $5 a bottle.</p>
        <p>For a brief time, California was a treasure trove of good roses. Even Robert Mondavi produced one, from the gamay grape, that could grace any summer table. In the mid-1980's, a number of wineries experimented with roses made from noble grapes like cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and pinot noir. Most wineries cut back on rose production as demand slid. Some continue to make just enough to sell at the winery, usually wine "bled" from red-wine tanks to give the red more concentration.</p>
        <p>More recently, there have been experiments with Rhone-style grapes like mourvedre. One of the more interesting roses from California bears the odd name Vin Gris de Cigare and comes from Bonny Doon Vineyard in the Santa Cruz Mountains, south of San Francisco. The name derives from Le Cigare Volant -- French slang for flying saucer -- which is the vineyard's best known wine. It is made from mourvedre, grenache and syrah. The vin gris is made from the same grapes, probably "bled" from the Cigare Volant vats.</p>
        <p>Regardless of how it's made in any given year, Vin Gris de Cigare is a delicous wine that would enhance any summer table. It sells for about $10.</p>
        <p>TASTINGS</p>
        <p>Oudinot Brut Champagne, non-vintage. About $17.  It's difficult to keep up with the Champagne industry. Wine drinkers have barely absorbed the news that prices are going up drastically when they are told there are huge surpluses in the cellars of Epernay and Rheims and prices are coming back down. This is just what has happened over the last four or five years. But happily for Champagne lovers, the boom-and-bust cycle is currently in their favor. There is plenty of competition this time around, much of it from smaller, little-known Champagne firms that produce good wine. Oudinot, based in Epernay, owns vines in important Champagne villages, enough to supply about half its needs. The wine, a blend dominated by pinot noir and chardonnay, is medium bodied with a delightful, nutty taste. For a relatively unknown wine, distribution is excellent. Discounting is common with Champagne at the moment, and the price may even be lower than $17 in some areas.</p>
