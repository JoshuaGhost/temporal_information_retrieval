        <p>Butch Reynolds has still not crossed the finish line victoriously in his long and bitter fight against the international governing body of track and field over a failed drug test.</p>
        <p>A Federal appeals panel in Cincinnati yesterday overturned on jurisdictional grounds a 1992 court ruling that awarded $27.3 million to Reynolds, the world record-holder at 400 meters.</p>
        <p>Reynolds was suspended from competition for two years after testing positive for a performance-enhancing anabolic steroid at a 1990 meet in Monte Carlo. He sued the International Amateur Athletic Federation, track and field's world governing body, denying that he had ever used steroids. Reynolds contended that the testing procedure was faulty and asserted that he had been defamed, denied due process and deprived of the prime years of his career. Award May Be at Stake</p>
        <p>In December 1992, Federal Judge Joseph Kinneary of Columbus, Ohio, ruled in Reynolds's favor, awarding him more than $27 million.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned Kinneary's ruling, saying, in effect, that a Federal court in Ohio lacked jurisdiction over a European-based organization such as the federation, which recently moved its operations from London to Monaco.</p>
        <p>John Gall, an attorney from Columbus who represents Reynolds, a former Ohio State star, said the case would be appealed all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. Olympic Officials Pay Attention</p>
        <p>With the 1996 Summer Games approaching in Atlanta, Olympic officials have been paying particular attention to the cases of Reynolds and Tonya Harding, the figure skater. They are concerned about their authority to discipline athletes and fear that a rash of lawsuits might disrupt the Atlanta Games.</p>
        <p>Harding competed in the recent Winter Olympics after threatening the United States Olympic Committee with a $25 million lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Primo Nebiolo, president of the federation, said in a statement that yesterday's ruling "underlines the independence and autonomy of international sports bodies in dispute with athletes."  TRACK AND FIELD</p>
