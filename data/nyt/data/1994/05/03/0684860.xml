        <p>Re "Top Quark, Last Piece in Puzzle of Matter, Appears to Be in Place" (front page, April 26): It is always a pleasure when a fundamental scientific discovery makes the front page, so I was delighted to see your report on the possible discovery of the top quark, a subatomic building block of matter. The top quark has been the most elusive of the quarks and leptons because of its high mass. Information about it is sorely needed by physicists working at the frontier of fundamental knowledge.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Top Quark, Last Piece in Puzzle of Matter, Appears to Be in Place" (front page, April 26): It is always a pleasure when a fundamental scientific discovery makes the front page, so I was delighted to see your report on the possible discovery of the top quark, a subatomic building block of matter. The top quark has been the most elusive of the quarks and leptons because of its high mass. Information about it is sorely needed by physicists working at the frontier of fundamental knowledge.</p>
        <p>However, it is misleading to report that by this discovery "the quest begun by philosophers in ancient Greece to understand the nature of matter may have ended" and that confirmation of the top quark discovery "would complete the experimental proof of the grand theoretical edifice known as the Standard Model."</p>
        <p>As its authors and practitioners so well know, there is a gaping hole in all our knowledge of the Standard Model. This hole involves the Higgs boson, which is a crucial ingredient of the standard model about which we have no experimental knowledge at all.</p>
        <p>The Higgs boson is tied up with some of the great mysteries of nature, like the structure of the vacuum, the curvature of the universe, the quantum nature of space time, and the question of whether there are new dimensions of space time not yet discovered. With problems like these unresolved, it is not likely that the quest may have ended.</p>
        <p>Since the United States superconducting supercollider project has been canceled, the best hope for discovering the Higgs boson is at the Large Hadron Collider project, which one hopes will become operational at the CERN laboratory in Geneva early in the next century.</p>
        <p>The discovery of the Higgs boson will have a different flavor from the discovery of the top quark. In the case of the top quark, there was a compelling theory for which experimental evidence has now been reported. Concerning the Higgs boson, theory is in an unsettled state and the implications of discovery are unusually far-flung. That is why so much scientific attention is focused on this problem.
