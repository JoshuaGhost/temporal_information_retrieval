        <p>Although it may have to wait until August to formally submit its proposal to get R. H. Macy &amp; Company out of bankruptcy protection through a merger, Federated Department Stores Inc. will still be able to get its plan through court by January, a spokeswoman for Federated said yesterday.</p>

        <p>Although it may have to wait until August to formally submit its proposal to get R. H. Macy &amp; Company out of bankruptcy protection through a merger, Federated Department Stores Inc. will still be able to get its plan through court by January, a spokeswoman for Federated said yesterday.</p>
        <p>"We're not at all discouraged by where we are in this process because of the substantial support we already do have among creditors," Carol Sanger, the Federated spokeswoman, said. "If there's enough support, there should be no problem with the time-table the judge has set out."</p>
        <p>Burton R. Lifland, the Federal bankruptcy court judge presiding over the Macy case, has made it clear that he wants the case concluded by January.</p>
        <p>On Friday, after two weeks of mediation had failed to produce a consensus among creditors about whether to support a Macy or Federated plan, Judge Lifland ordered Macy to file its reorganization plan as soon as possible, effectively sidelining Federated until Aug. 1, when Macy's exclusive right to file a proposal is scheduled to expire. Concerns Raised by Creditors</p>
        <p>Creditors raised concerns that waiting that long would make it almost impossible for Federated to submit a counterproposal that could be approved by January.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Sanger said that given the support Federated had among creditors, gaining the rest of the necessary approval it would need would be fairly straightforward.</p>
        <p>Still, some creditors said they were considering asking the judge to terminate Macy's exclusivity early. Federated is not likely to consider such a move on its own, although it might participate in senior creditors' efforts because it is one of Macy's senior creditors, people familiar with the case said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanger said Federated was "disappointed but not surprised" that the mediation process had failed to produce a clear-cut consensus in favor of one plan or the other. "The idea of getting a consensus in such a short time is difficult, particularly when the creditors' interests are so disparate," she said.</p>
        <p>After two weeks of negotiations with all the creditors, Cyrus R. Vance, the court-appointed mediator, told Judge Lifland that neither plan had enough support among creditors to win clear approval under bankruptcy laws. Federated had garnered the allegiance of Macy's influential senior creditors and the committee representing Macy's suppliers and other trade creditors.</p>
        <p>But Macy's bondholders favored Macy's plan, creating a stalemate. The committee representing them contends that the package of stock, warrants, rights and gift certificates that Macy is offering them is valued at $500 million or more, while Federated's offer is valued at $400 million.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanger said the bondholders' committee was valuing Macy's offer based on the company's future value, not its value upon emerging from bankruptcy. "We're offering them a position in Federated equity, which trades in the market, so there's no question about what the value of our currency is," she said. "Macy is offering the bondholders a lot of things that most people would value at zero. What the committee is doing is using the premise of higher value to inflate the value of the securities Macy is giving them."</p>
        <p>Ms. Sanger noted that in 1991 when Federated filed a plan to get itself out of bankruptcy, it only had the approval of its senior creditors. "We then started to work on the bondholders, and once the momentum got going, we got them on board, too," she said. Federated emerged from bankruptcy in 1992, just days after Macy filed for protection.</p>
        <p>Robert M. Miller, the lawyer representing the bondholders' committee, declined to comment, citing a confidentiality agreement Mr. Vance had asked all parties involved in the mediation process to sign. But one bondholder noted yesterday that a package of securities that Federated had offered to bondholders on May 9 was also overvalued by about 20 percent.  COMPANY NEWS</p>
