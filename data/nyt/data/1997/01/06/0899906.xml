        <p>An Alice-in-Wonderland quality permeates tomorrow's House vote on Newt Gingrich. First comes the verdict, with Republicans in unsafe seats marching lock step over the cliff shouting ''on with our head!,'' and not until next week will we witness the ethical trial -- with the charges to be detailed for the first time to jurors and spectators.</p>
        <p>You have to credit Newt with skillful non-campaigning. That television shot of him in front of his mother-in-law's house, meeting the press while carrying two large garbage bags, like Everyman surprised while doing the chores -- an update of the Jimmy Carter garment-bag stunt -- was an image-maker's dream. (''Ma, we got any garbage to take out? Can we borrow some?'')</p>
        <p>You have to fault Democrats for failing to make this constitutional argument: If Bill Clinton and Al Gore, who appear together all too often, were to be swept from the board, the Presidency would devolve upon a member of the opposite party for the first time in our history. Would the ethically tainted Gingrich be the best Republican for such a potentially wrenching transition? No.</p>
        <p>And you have to wonder at the Republicans for advancing the notion that former Speaker Jim Wright was driven out for ''lining his pockets'' while Newt is being challenged for using tax-exempt funds for the Revolution's benefit and not his own.</p>
        <p>As soon as that tax-free foundation and college course helped him gain the Speakership, he cashed in on his new celebrity and power with a book deal that profited him $700,000 -- many times the amount Wright ripped off on his phony book deal.</p>
        <p>To this, the Lewis Carrolls of the G.O.P. will say Newt's cashing-in while still in office was not against House ethics rules. True enough; a generation ago, author Mo Udall slipped in an exemption for books to the House's outside-income cap, a loophole that Gingrich has zealously preserved -- but private enrichment while in public office is still wrong. (Become a millionaire afterward, as Colin Powell and George Stephanopoulos properly did.) To claim now that Wright got rich while Newt stayed poor is inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable.</p>
        <p>This is no criminal matter. But by hanging tough in this highest-profile case, Newt forces the I.R.S. to set an example by lifting the tax exemption of not only a foundation but perhaps a college, thereby threatening its existence. Endangering a school is nothing to be proud of.</p>
        <p>Am I burning my bridges to the 21st century with this apostasy? No less a nonpartisan authority than The Washington Post's David Broder writes that my published advice to Newt to step aside ''illustrates a confusion about roles and responsibilities that is a danger to our democracy.''</p>
        <p>He argues that ''a journalist has no business advising a politician'' and -- decrying the longtime invasion of journalism by former politicians --  holds that commentators thus grounded in partisanship and practiced in populist appeals undermine representative government by forcing legislators to ''execute the wishes of the majority'' against their better judgment.</p>
        <p>Alexander Hamilton lives!</p>
        <p>The collegial David and I have for decades debated the virtues of inside experience in analyzing politics. Although many fine journalists grump about pols who ''cross the street'' into the land of lucrative purity and newsies who gain power as press secretaries, I think that's healthy cross-pollination.</p>
        <p>Broder is right about the clear conflict in journalists giving private advice to politicians. When the Speaker calls me, however, and I drop an unexpected opinion on him, get a reaction plus a revealing financial fact, and promptly write all about it, that's not just my living -- that's my role in political life.</p>
        <p>To see through the image-making (garbage bags); to make the unmade argument (transfer of power in succession); to winkle out the point-making fact ($700,000 earnings); to publicize the unremarked threat (to others' tax exemptions); and to advise specific action (step aside, Newt) -- that's how I see my job.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, as in Clinton's Asian connection, such iconoclasm starts a stampede; other times, as in Newt's case, it draws sermons about loyalty from political allies and charges of subversion from a journalist I respect. But informed public advocacy and ethical judgment-calling even by a recovering Nixonite are hardly a ''danger to democracy.''</p>
