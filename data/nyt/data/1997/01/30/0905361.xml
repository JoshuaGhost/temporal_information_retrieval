        <p>Wall Street halted a weeklong decline yesterday as stock prices rallied while interest rates fell.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average gained 84.66 points, closing at 6,740.74.</p>
        <p>In another display of the market's unpredictable late-afternoon volatility, about half the day's rise occurred in the final 20 minutes of trading when stock prices surged about 45 points.</p>
        <p>''We were basically gung-ho all day,'' said Arthur Hogan, head of equity trading at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''The bias was on the up side, and the winners were all our favorites, the same band leaders.''</p>
        <p>Once again, the Dow was helped by shares of I.B.M., which rose for the second consecutive day. The stock had lost 13 percent since Jan. 22, the day after it reported less than spectacular earnings. On Tuesday, I.B.M. announced a 2-for-1 stock split, and since then its shares have recovered somewhat. Yesterday, I.B.M. was up 5 5/8, to 156 3/8, but still well below its high of 168.</p>
        <p>Ten other Dow stocks also showed gains of at least one point. General Electric rose 3, to 103 5/8; Du Pont was up 2 7/8, to 107 1/4, despite reporting fourth-quarter earnings that were just below analysts' expectations, and Philip Morris was up 2, to 116 3/8, after it reported that its fourth-quarter net income matched analysts' expectations.</p>
        <p>Exxon also rose yesterday, pacing an oil stock rally that included Chevron and Texaco. Exxon was up 2 3/4, to 103 1/4; Chevron gained 1 5/8, to 66 5/8, and Texaco advanced 1 3/4, to 107.</p>
        <p>Although the Dow had surrendered 229 points in the previous five sessions, it is still 292 points, or 4.5 percent, ahead of last year's close.</p>
        <p>The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks also fared well yesterday. The index gained 7.48 points, or nearly 1 percent, to close at 772.50. But the Nasdaq composite made only slight gains. It was up eight-tenths of a point , to 1,355.17, largely on the continued strength of Intel, which closed at a record high. Intel is up 18 percent this year, and 48 percent in the past three months. Yesterday it  climbed 3 3/4, to 154 3/4.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the stock market was helped by the bond market's positive reaction to news from the Commerce Department that durable goods orders -- generally factory equipment that lasts for more than three years -- had fallen in December, another sign that inflation may be under control.</p>
        <p>As yields on the 30-year Treasury bond fell, stock prices soared. At 11:46 A.M., after the Dow had gained 50 points, the New York Stock Exchange applied an electronic ''collar'' to slow down computer program trading. The Dow retreated later in the day, only to rally at the end.</p>
        <p>Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York, said that during yesterday's rally the market looked a lot like it did earlier in the month, when investors snapped up large capitalization stocks, leaving stocks of smaller companies to lag behind. Yesterday, the Russell 2000, an index of small cap stocks, lost 0.22 point to close at 366.25. For the year the index is up 1 percent.</p>
        <p>''This is a very narrow rally,'' Mr. Bleier said. ''It's being led by the big names that have dominated the market for the last few months. The bottom line is that the companies that haven't disappointed in the past are the big movers.''</p>
        <p>Several analysts said that strong cash flows into mutual funds continued to bolster a market that was sometimes distracted by rising interest rates.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, things can go either way,'' said Mr. Hogan at Dean Witter, speaking of the Dow's gains and losses in January. ''But we ran them up 500 points, spotted them 200 points and now were up again. And this is just January.''</p>
