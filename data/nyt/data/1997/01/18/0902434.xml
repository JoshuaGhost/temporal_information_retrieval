        <p>After protests from community groups and local politicians, the city has told the private contractor on a sewer project in Harlem to suspend its work on Monday for the holiday observing the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
        <p>The contractor on the project, on Malcolm X Boulevard near 125th Street, originally planned to keep working on Monday since its contract with its unions did not name the day as a holiday.</p>

        <p>After protests from community groups and local politicians, the city has told the private contractor on a sewer project in Harlem to suspend its work on Monday for the holiday observing the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.</p>
        <p>The contractor on the project, on Malcolm X Boulevard near 125th Street, originally planned to keep working on Monday since its contract with its unions did not name the day as a holiday.</p>
        <p>But that plan upset some leaders in Harlem, who felt it showed a lack of respect for the memory of Dr. King.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after complaints from Councilwoman C. Virginia Fields, city officials announced that the work would be suspended. They said it had not yet been determined who would cover the cost of the lost time, which the contractor put at $4,000.</p>
        <p>Community groups, including the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce, brought the matter to the attention of Councilwoman Fields, who sent a letter on Thursday to Don Warnett, consulting engineer for the Department of Design and Construction, to express her displeasure.</p>
        <p>''I was appalled to hear that the work on the Malcolm X Boulevard Construction Project would persist on Monday, Jan. 20, 1997 -- the national holiday that celebrates the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,'' Ms. Fields wrote.</p>
        <p>''Dr. King's memory is highly regarded in the Harlem community. Any actions that result in not recognizing his birthday as a national holiday is an insult to his legacy, the civil rights movement and to the Harlem community.''</p>
        <p>Matthew Monahan, a spokesman for the Department of Design and Construction, said the King holiday had not been included in the original contract but that the department decided yesterday to stop work after consulting with the Mayor's office.</p>
        <p>''We are going to because it is the right thing to do, to honor the legacy and memory of Dr. King,'' Mr. Monahan said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monahan said the work was part of a $46 million city construction project that would improve the roadway and upgrade the sewer system in Harlem.</p>
        <p>Andy Vieira, the general supervisor of Felix Equities, the contractor on the project, said earlier yesterday that although the day was not among the paid holidays in the company's union contract, workers were given the day off last year.</p>
        <p>''It would be nice to let the workers off,'' Mr. Vieira said. ''But it's going to cost the company about $4,000 to do that.''</p>
        <p>As of last evening, Mr. Monahan said the monetary details would be worked out by the city early next week. ''For now, the important thing is that the workers are getting Monday off,'' he said.</p>
