        <p>Beginning this morning, the Transit Authority plans to shut two escalators, halting weekday service on the Queens-bound lines from 7:30 to 10 A.M.

        <p>Queens-bound E and F trains will skip the Lexington Avenue and 53d Street stop during the morning rush hours as workers begin the second phase of a $10.5 million project to replace the station's old escalators.</p>
        <p>Beginning this morning, the Transit Authority plans to shut two escalators, halting weekday service on the Queens-bound lines from 7:30 to 10 A.M. Riders will also be barred from entering the station at the Third Avenue entrance during those hours. Passengers will not be allowed to exit the station at Third Avenue on weekdays from 3 to 7 P.M.</p>
        <p>Riders headed uptown in Manhattan are encouraged either to leave the trains at the Fifth Avenue stop in Manhattan and walk, or to exit at 23d Street and Ely Avenue in Queens and ride back on the Manhatan-bound line to the Lexington Avenue station. The work is expected to take four months. The contractor has been offered financial incentives to finish early, said Termaine Garden, an authority spokesman.</p>
        <p>The work will not prevent free transfers with the No. 6 train, as it did in May, when two of the station's four 56-foot-high elevators were replaced. Only riders with the Metrocard could transfer free while that work was done. That was completed in September, and the 170,000 riders resumed commuting largely free of hassle.</p>
        <p>The 30-year-old escalators had to be replaced since they had been breaking down, Mr. Garden said. The new escalators have a computer diagnostic system to identify quickly any trouble that develops.</p>
