        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Gloria Steinem gets its right (''Hollywood Cleans Up Hustler,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 7). None of us involved in motion pictures can deny Milos Forman's talent; no one who has seen ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' can disparage his directorial skills.</p>
        <p>Further, few can argue with the inherent political statement: It often takes the worst of us to provoke the arguments that protect the rest of us, even the best of us. But that sentence does not automatically require any feeling of respect, admiration or even gratitude for the individuals who have caused a reaffirmation of the Bill of Rights.</p>
        <p>As a signatory and contributor to the full-page advertisement that appeared in The New York Times some years ago supporting Mr. Flynt's rights, I was treated to a token of his gratitude: a videotape of news reports chronicling his court victories -- interspersed with graphic scenes of various sexual acts. Mr. Flynt had seemingly concluded that we had endorsed his taste as well as his rights. He was mistaken.</p>
        <p>To my mind, one fact has been underreported: Neither Mr. Forman nor his producers felt comfortable in presenting any of the images that were and are the heart and soul of Hustler magazine. The Supreme Court liberated Larry Flynt. Why not ''Larry Flynt''?</p>
        <p>PETER STONE  New York, Jan. 7, 1997</p>
        <p>The writer is a screenwriter.</p>
