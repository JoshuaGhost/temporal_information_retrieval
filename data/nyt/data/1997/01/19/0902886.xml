        <p>Three men described by investigators as members of a Fujianese gang were charged in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Friday with the November kidnapping of a 12-year-old Connecticut boy, Federal law-enforcement officials said. The boy was held for six days and released unharmed in Queens after his father paid a ransom of $88,000.</p>
        <p>After his release, the boy, Wei Yang, identified his kidnappers from photographs of known Asian gang members, said Merrill Parks Jr., the special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Connecticut. Investigators also recovered a wallet belonging to a suspect from a light blue minivan used to pick up the ransom on a patch of grass where the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and the Long Island Expressway intersect.</p>
