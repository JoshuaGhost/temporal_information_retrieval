        <p>CATHY JONES sat in the stands last week for a basketball game at Long Island University on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn to watch her son, Charles, who, to the surprise of many, is the leading scorer in the nation. He was playing in an unlikely arena that was once the Paramount Theater, and which still has the old, ornate gilded ceiling and rococo columns on the walls, an arena, her son says, that makes him feel as if he's ''in a museum.''</p>
        <p>And Cathy Jones watched as her spindly, 6-foot-3-inch, 185-pound, 21-year-old son, a college junior, hit jump shots and drives and brought the crowd to its feet with a soaring alley-oop jam, as he scored 28 points, about 3 below his average, in L.I.U.'s 81-57 romp over Wagner in a Northeast Conference game.</p>
        <p>She watched proudly, but hardly complacently, as he came out of the game in the waning minutes to a standing ovation, a little appreciative smile raising his thin mustache. She understands that life -- and her and Charles's lives are no exceptions -- is generally a work in progress.</p>
        <p>But even in his relatively brief life, Charles Jones has come a long way. He has arrived at this point from the sometimes desperate streets of Bedford-Stuyvesant, where, he says, some ''15 or 16 of my close friends'' have been killed. The journey has brought him from clashes with coaches first at Bishop Ford High School and then at Rutgers, which he left after two years, and from one year of sitting on the sideline before returning to the court with L.I.U.</p>
        <p>''If it wasn't for his mother,'' said Ray Nash, Charles's coach at Bishop Ford, ''I'm not sure he would have finished high school, let alone be in the position he's in now.''</p>
        <p>Each L.I.U. player has been asked various questions, including who his role model is. ''Cathy Jones,'' Charles answered. ''She has done a wonderful job raising me and my brother, Lamont.''</p>
        <p>Lamont is three years older than Charles, and played basketball for the University of Bridgeport. He is now playing in a semipro league on the East Coast; not even his brother knows the name of it.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't easy, and yes, I made sacrifices, but that's what parents have to do,'' said Cathy Jones, who is employed as a review chief with the Internal Revenue Service in Brooklyn, close by the L.I.U. campus. ''I was always on my boys' backs to come home right after school, or right after practice, and not hang in the streets.'' Her husband, Charles Sr., a conductor in the New York subway system, died of cancer three years ago. ''I decided then to get a second job,'' she said. ''But I found that when I came home late, so did the boys. I gave up my second job to make sure they came home when they were supposed to.''</p>
        <p>Charles was a boy with an extraordinary ability at a game. The game was basketball, which can pay dividends of a sort that some other games, like Ring-a-livio, or Kick the Can, for example, do not.</p>
        <p>The attention a boy like that receives can fatten his head. Perhaps it did that to Charles Jones, who was ''kinda mouthy'' in high school, said Nash, and then went to Rutgers on a scholarship and didn't think he had to go to class. Jones was the team's leading scorer in his freshman year, and in his sophomore year, too, until he was suspended from the team for the last seven games of the season.</p>
        <p>''It was disappointing, and I told him so,'' his mother said. ''But Charles was at a big school, and he sort of got lost in it. He told me, 'Mommy, I want to come home.' I told him to stick it through, that everything will be O.K. But I should have listened to him. And when I saw how unhappy he was, I agreed that he should return home.'' Charles was required to sit out a year before playing for L.I.U., and almost every day now he meets his mother for lunch.</p>
        <p>''Not playing for the team that year helped me grow up,'' Charles said. ''I realized how much I missed basketball, and how much it meant to me. I also realized that you can't separate it from academics.''</p>
        <p>He says he has got twice as many credits in one year at L.I.U., majoring in media arts, as he did in two years at Rutgers. He says his grades are good, befitting someone who had an 85 average in high school and a score of 1050 on the Scholastic Assessment Test. ''Charles,'' Nash said, ''is smart, but like a lot of kids, he has made mistakes.''</p>
        <p>Charles still has a way to go, and so does L.I.U (8-6), which stumbled, 88-84, Friday night to lowly Marist (3-10) despite 30 points by Jones. ''Charles is so talented that sometimes he gets bored,'' said Ray Haskins, the L.I.U. coach. ''Like against Wagner, he didn't go for the loose ball like he should have, or the rebounds. I hollered at him, 'You can't just mail in a ball game!' ''</p>
        <p>Like a lot of good and even not-so-good high school and college players, Charles Jones has dreams of playing in the National Basketball Association. ''It's my goal,'' he said. If he doesn't make it? ''Then I'd like to do something in the music business,'' he said. ''Maybe producing, but I'm not sure. I know I just love music.'' He's more certain of his ability as a basketball player. Marty Blake, director of scouting for the N.B.A., said ''Jones is a prospect, if he can harness his talent.''</p>
        <p>If he follows good advice, that is. Like his mother gave him, and insisted on. ''I wanted him to stay focused on school,'' she said. ''I didn't want him to go astray.''</p>
        <p>This story does not end here, of course. And it is hoped that Charles Jones, and the Charles Joneses of the world, will be prepared to be productive even if their one-in-a-million dream of making the N.B.A. doesn't materialize.</p>
        <p>What we can be sure of, however, is that Cathy Jones, and the Cathy Joneses of the world, will continue as they have, little-known, resolute, indispensable.</p>
