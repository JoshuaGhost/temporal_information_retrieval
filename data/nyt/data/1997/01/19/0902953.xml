        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Americans seem to have a magical faith that change in law can engineer whatever new behavior is desired. The movement to limit divorce is a good example (Op-Ed, Jan. 13).</p>
        <p>Even before no-fault divorce was accepted, most couples agreed to divorce. In those rare instances when one spouse did not want a divorce, the judgment was made that if one partner had made a decision no longer to try to make the marriage work, reconciliation was not possible. Barring divorce in such instances could lead to higher levels of spousal violence and informal desertion.</p>
        <p>It would be a bad idea to place limitations on no-fault divorce. Before divorce is permitted, procedures should be created so that spouses do not divorce before they have made a rational decision to do so. Abolishing no-fault divorce would have many costs. Not least would be requiring people to stay married to people they no longer respect or care for.</p>
