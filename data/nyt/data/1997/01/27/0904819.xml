        <p>Editorial backs New York Gov George Pataki's proposals to combine Social Services Department's programs for poor, abused and neglected children and Division of Youth's programs for youths in trouble with law in proposed Children and Family Services Department (S)</p>

        <p>Gov. George Pataki of New York has a sensible plan to consolidate many children's services that now reside in two agencies. He hopes this will provide more effective help to the state's most troubled children.</p>
        <p>Poor, abused and neglected children are now served by the Department of Social Services. The Division of Youth runs juvenile detention facilities and other programs directed at youths who get in trouble with the law. The two departments often see the same children at different stages of their lives. Many social service workers and community activists have long pushed for greater coherence among children's programs.</p>

        <p>Gov. George Pataki of New York has a sensible plan to consolidate many children's services that now reside in two agencies. He hopes this will provide more effective help to the state's most troubled children.</p>
        <p>Poor, abused and neglected children are now served by the Department of Social Services. The Division of Youth runs juvenile detention facilities and other programs directed at youths who get in trouble with the law. The two departments often see the same children at different stages of their lives. Many social service workers and community activists have long pushed for greater coherence among children's programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki has now taken their advice and that of a task force he set up to restructure social services. His proposed Department of Children and Family Services would include child welfare programs, crisis centers for victims of domestic violence, child care services, pregnancy prevention and residential services for youths who become involved in the juvenile justice system.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki would increase child care funding by $54 million to create about 23,000 more day-care slots for mothers on welfare who will be expected to work under the new welfare reform law. He is adding $70 million for services for abused and neglected children and $2.4 million for new delinquency prevention programs.</p>
        <p>That is a welcome reversal by a Governor who has not previously been generous with child welfare and delinquency prevention programs.</p>
