        <p>The head of Syria's delegation in the peace talks with Israel says that Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made a commitment to withdraw from all of the Golan Heights as part of a peace agreement -- and that his successor, Shimon Peres, reaffirmed the commitment.</p>
        <p>Walid al-Moualem, the Syrian Ambassador to the United States, made that among many points about the negotiations in an interview just published in the Journal of Palestine Studies. His comments are an unusually detailed statement of the Syrian view.</p>
        <p>The Ambassador said that in January 1996 the talks with Israel were going so well that the two sides set a deadline of June ''to close the remaining gaps,'' with the expectation that ''by September the final document would be ready.'' Then Mr. Peres called early elections, terrorist bombs struck Israel and the Syrian-Israeli negotiations were suspended.</p>
        <p>The interviewer, Linda Butler, managing editor of the Journal, asked Mr. al-Moualem ''through what medium'' Mr. Rabin had conveyed his withdrawal offer. He replied, ''I prefer not to say.'' But he said the offer was repeated in the negotiating room at the Wye Plantation in Maryland. ''And I told Dennis Ross $(the American facilitator in the talks$): 'Please register what the Israeli side said.' ''</p>
        <p>Because the aim was ''a comprehensive agreement,'' Mr. al-Moualem said, the parties did not sign points agreed but deposited them with the Americans until all the issues had been resolved. The main matters to be negotiated apart from the Syrian demand for total withdrawal from the Golan were security arrangements and normalization of relations.</p>
        <p>Itamar Rabinovich, who as Israeli Ambassador in Washington played a significant part in the talks, took a very different view of what happened when I telephoned him. He has returned to a professorship in history at the University of Tel Aviv.</p>
        <p>''There was no agreement'' on withdrawal, he said; ''there was no commitment, there was no promise.'' If Mr. al-Moualem heard something from someone on the Israeli side, Mr. Rabinovich said, ''it was not deposited with the Americans.'' As for finishing an agreement by September if the talks had continued, he said: ''I don't think this would have happened.''</p>
        <p>What really occurred, Mr. Rabinovich said, was that Mr. Ross and other American participants, seeking to bridge the gap, were given to understand by the Israelis that full withdrawal ''was in the realm of the possible'' -- but only if Syria met Israel's needs on security and normalization.  And ''the Israeli conditions were never met.''</p>
        <p>Ambassador Rabinovich called the al-Moualem interview ''a very interesting document, the most explicit and detailed Syrian comment on these negotiations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. al-Moualem said Prime Ministers Rabin and Peres both ''wanted to achieve a settlement with Syria, but each had his own speed and conditions. Rabin was reluctant, suspicious, very cautious. He moved very slowly, inch by inch. When Peres became Prime Minister, he was in a hurry.'' Mr. Rabinovich said he agreed that ''Rabin was too slow and Peres too quick.''</p>
        <p>On security issues, Mr. al-Moualem underlined Syrian rejection of Israel's proposal for a ground station in the Golan after withdrawal. ''We would refuse,'' he said, ''even if it would be manned by Americans.''</p>
        <p>On normalization, he said totally open economic relations would not work when Syria had a per capita income of $900 a year and Israel $15,000. He said the parties had discussed ''a transitional period during which we could raise our economy to the level where there can be competition without undue hardship on our society.''</p>
        <p>The interview makes clear how bleak the prospect is now for the Israeli-Syrian talks. Mr. al-Moualem said Syria was ready to resume them if the new Israeli Government of Benjamin Netanyahu recognized ''the commitments made by the previous Governments.'' Mr. Netanyahu, who has opposed withdrawal, said only last week that the Golan was ''critical to the defense of the state of Israel.''</p>
        <p>''Nothing can compensate the  Syrian people for losing one inch of the Golan,'' Mr. al-Moualem said. ''Not even the moon. It is a sacred cause. . . .</p>
        <p>''That is where we stand. The American efforts are now focused on the Palestinian track. We don't mind. We are not in a hurry.''</p>
