        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In proposing that the United States resume the sale of advanced weapon systems to Latin America, the outgoing Secretaries of State and Defense, Warren Christopher and William J. Perry, fell prey to bureaucracies with little sense of history.</p>
        <p>You also criticize this recommendation (editorial, Jan. 20).</p>
        <p>In earlier days, uncontrolled United States arms sales contributed to bloodshed and economic distress in the region. The Carter Administration halted this. And in one of the cold war's hottest periods, the Reagan Administration hardly wavered in the effort to prevent the proliferation of advanced weapons in Latin America.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, who has enjoyed several major policy successes in the region, would put the future (and American lives) at risk by fostering a costly arms race for the sake of short-term exports.</p>
        <p>A remilitarization of Latin America would mean diversion of resources for development, a more troubled region that is more open to drug cartels, and less healthy democracies.</p>
        <p>The President should now direct Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen to work with Latin America to construct a regional regime for conventional arms limitations that is focused on advanced weaponry. Under a regional regime, the United States -- and Russia and France, for example -- could sell weapons, including aircraft, only if they fit the region's criteria, guaranteeing that a Pandora's box of regional rivalries would not be reopened by unrestrained purchases of advanced weapons.</p>
        <p>A decision by the President simply to lift the ban on advanced weapons to Latin America would be seen by many Latin Americans as a bad-neighbor policy, not the stuff for a place in history.</p>
