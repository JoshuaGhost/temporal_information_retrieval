        <p>BRETL-John of Barrington, RI. Our friend, a gentleman for all seasons. Successful investment banker, accomplished artisan and sailor. His analytic mind, intellectual curiosity, keen eye and love of perfection were apparent in all he undertook. We will remember his love of family, warmth, wit, and calm and his quest, always, for excellence. His counsel will be missed and we offer sincere condolences to his beloved wife, Valerie, and family.
