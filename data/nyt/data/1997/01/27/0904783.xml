        <p>Rain-weary Californians breathed a small sigh of relief today after a second round of storms failed to deliver as much rain as predicted, sparing the state's weakened levees and exhausted emergency personnel from more flooding.</p>
        <p>As late as Friday evening, meteorologists were anticipating disaster for the state's Central Valley, where a week of wet, warm weather earlier this month melted thick snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

        <p>Rain-weary Californians breathed a small sigh of relief today after a second round of storms failed to deliver as much rain as predicted, sparing the state's weakened levees and exhausted emergency personnel from more flooding.</p>
        <p>As late as Friday evening, meteorologists were anticipating disaster for the state's Central Valley, where a week of wet, warm weather earlier this month melted thick snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada mountains. That sent billions of gallons of water coursing through the state's elaborate reservoir system, overwhelming dozens of aged levees and flooding thousands of homes. Because water still hides much of the destruction in low-lying areas, the damage has yet to be totaled, but preliminary estimates put the cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Forecasters had called for up to six inches of rain from two storm systems this weekend. But, driven by gusty coastal winds, the storms blew through many areas too quickly to cause much havoc.</p>
        <p>''It had all the punch just packed in a shorter period of time,'' said Jan Null, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in San Francisco, which began lifting flood watches for many areas late Saturday afternoon. ''And after Tuesday, it looks like it'll be dry for the rest of the week.''</p>
        <p>Still, the storms did not completely spare the region. In the Sierra mountains, the rains loosed a 600-foot-wide avalanche of mud and debris that closed Highway 50, the main east-west artery between San Francisco and the resorts of Lake Tahoe. Transportation officials said it may be weeks before the route is cleared.</p>
        <p>In Napa County, north of San Francisco, the Russian River was well above flood level, but little damage was reported. Counties throughout the northern part of the state reported localized flooding from swollen creeks. And in San Francisco, a dozen homes -- including the home of the police chief -- were imperiled when mud slides sent rock and water drumming over their roofs.</p>
        <p>With heavy snow still falling in the mountains, state officials say the floods of 1997 may not be over. ''The ground is still saturated, and we're still here,'' said Anita Fante, a spokeswoman for the state's Flood Control Center. ''This flood center may be operational for a long time.''</p>
