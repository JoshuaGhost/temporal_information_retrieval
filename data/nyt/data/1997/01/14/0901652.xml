        <p>In the realm of extraordinary scientific concepts, black holes are the strangest and most awesome places in the universe, something out of the mind of Albert Einstein sharing spacetime with the imagination of Lewis Carroll.</p>
        <p>A black hole, as conceived in interpretations of Einstein's theory of general relativity, is a region of space in which matter is so concentrated and the pull of its gravity is so powerful that nothing, not even light, can emerge from it. It is the ultimate point of no return. If Alice had ventured into this Wonderland, she would have found herself in a void created by this hidden mass and experienced time and space behaving in bizarre ways -- but would have been unable to return or even report back what she had seen.</p>
        <p>By definition, a black hole cannot be seen. Its presence must be detected through indirect evidence: the vast whirlpools of matter being sucked in by consuming gravity at ever increasing velocities. Recent observations, after three decades of theorizing and searching, have satisfied even the most cautious astrophysicists that black holes almost certainly exist.</p>
        <p>Now scientists have found evidence that supermassive black holes probably lurk at the core of nearly all galaxies and that the mass of each one seems to be proportional to the mass of its host galaxy. This conclusion was drawn from the discovery by the Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in Hawaii of three more black holes in relatively nearby ordinary galaxies, and from a wider survey of other possible black holes.</p>
        <p>Scientists have also detected for the first time what they think is confirming evidence for the existence of the boundary of no return surrounding a black hole -- an ''event horizon'' across which matter and energy pass in one direction only, falling in but never coming back out. The new findings, based on several telescope and spacecraft observations and innovative computer analysis, were reported here today at the 189th meeting of the American Astronomical Society.</p>
        <p>Dr. Scott D. Tremaine of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics in Toronto said the new research seemed to show that in ''two quite different contexts, black holes really do exist.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Douglas Richstone of the University of Michigan said he would still not bet everything he owned on the reality of black holes. ''But I would be willing to bet my car on it, and it's a good car,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the detection of the event horizon, Dr. Ramesh Narayan, associate director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., said, ''This is the most direct evidence scientists have had that black holes are real.'' Dr. Narayan headed the team making the detection.</p>
        <p>The group of astronomers predicting the prevalence of galactic black holes, led by Dr. Richstone, said it was still a challenging puzzle as to why black holes were so abundant, or why they should be proportional to a galaxy's mass. Whatever the explanation, it could yield insights about the formation and evolution of galaxies. The more astrophyicists can probe the mysteries of black holes, the more they feel they will learn about cosmic history.</p>
        <p>In ''Gravity's Fatal Attraction,'' published last year by the Scientific American Library, Dr. Mitchell Begelman of the University of Colorado and Sir Martin Rees, an astrophysicist at Cambridge University and Astronomer Royal of England, wrote that black holes ''represent the ultimate triumph of gravity over all other forces.'' They concluded, ''When we really understand black holes, we will understand the origin of the universe itself.''</p>
        <p>As scientists now recognize, black holes come in at least two varieties: stellar and galactic. The stellar ones, much smaller, are formed when massive stars, each weighing several times more than the Sun, run out of nuclear fuel and collapse into a compact object only a few miles in diameter. In most cases, the result is a neutron star, a dense stellar cinder. But the most massive stars are likely to collapse into black holes. Most of these probably exist alone in interstellar space, with not enough gas and other matter around them to be swallowed up at energies sufficient to produce detectable emissions of radiation; thus their presence remains beyond recognition.</p>
        <p>But some stellar black holes make themselves known because they exist in a binary system as the companion to a normal star, which they are cannibalizing. X-ray emissions around a rotating object known as V404 Cyg revealed that its powerful gravity was tearing gas away from its larger companion star, pulling it into a spiraling disk and finally consuming it. Studies of V404 Cyg and other binary systems that emit copious X-rays produced the new findings about the event horizon of a black hole.</p>
        <p>The most formidable black holes are those at the hearts of galaxies. Some of these may have existed for 90 percent of cosmic history.</p>
        <p>Over time, some runaway processes, as yet unexplained, have concentrated matter at galactic cores that can be equivalent to the mass of as many as three billion Suns, all squeezed into an area no larger than the solar system. Dr. John Archibald Wheeler, a Princeton University astrophysicist, had these in mind when he coined the term black hole.</p>
        <p>The most compelling evidence for the reality of such a supermassive black hole, in the giant galaxy M87, was gathered three years ago by the Hubble telescope. The swirling gases around the black hole stretched across a distance of 500 light-years. Energy released from gas falling toward the hole produced a jet of electrons spiraling outward at nearly the speed of light. Evidence is also mounting for other galactic black holes, including a likely one at the center of Earth's Milky Way galaxy.</p>
        <p>Two of the newly discovered black holes, reported today, are at the cores of the galaxies NGC 3379 and NGC 3377 in the constellation Leo. They weigh in at 50 million and 100 million solar masses, respectively. The third new galactic black hole is at the center of NGC 4486b, in the constellation Virgo.</p>
        <p>An analysis of observations by the orbiting Hubble telescope showed a sharp rise in the velocities of stars near the centers of these galaxies, accelerations that would be produced by the gravity of mass concentrations on the order of black holes. The research was complemented by observations at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, conducted by Dr. John Kormendy of the University of Hawaii.</p>
        <p>From these data and other findings, astronomers have developed computer models of the velocity patterns apparently produced by galactic black holes. Using this information, they made a quick survey of 15 other nearby galaxies and found that 14 of them exhibited behavior consistent with the model for the gravitational influence of a black hole.</p>
        <p>On the strength of this, Dr. Richstone predicted that nearly all galaxies probably contain black holes. And the estimated masses of these led to the conclusion that the strength of a black hole is related to the size of its galaxy. ''This is probably the key evidence that a black hole's presence is intimately connected to the evolution of the galaxy,'' Dr. Richstone said at a news conference. This in turn, he said, ''strongly supports the theory that black holes are the energy sources for quasars.''</p>
        <p>Quasars are the most distant, oldest and most luminous objects that can be seen. At an earlier time, when they were young, galaxies would probably have been visible only as  brightly burning quasars, the result of tremendous energies produced by gas and stars plunging in toward black holes at their cores. Some quasars can still be seen, but the new evidence suggests that in galactic black holes, astronomers are detecting surviving ''fossil quasars.''</p>
        <p>If galactic black holes may reveal the history of galaxies, the smaller stellar black holes should provide insights into the evolution and death of stars. As a result of the new research, said Dr. Tremaine, the evidence for the existence of stellar black holes is even stronger than that for galactic ones.</p>
        <p>The detection of an event horizon, a kind of invisible one-way membrane that Einstein's theory predicted should surround a black hole, was made possible by measurements primarily from the Japanese-American X-ray astronomy satellite, ASCA. The measurements of radiations from two stars orbiting each other, one normal and the other extremely compact, agreed with a computer model of how gases accreting around a stellar black hole should behave.</p>
        <p>In the model, gases pulled in by the compact star's gravity should become extremely hot but should radiate only a small fraction of the heat as radiation. When the superheated gases reach the center, they would disappear through the event horizon and carry with them their enormous thermal energy -- if the compact object is a black hole. In that case, the object would appear very dim in the X-ray spectrum. But if the object is a neutron star, the energy from the infalling gases would be reflected by the star's solid surface, releasing a shower of X-rays.</p>
        <p>Observations of two binary-star systems showed the difference, scientists said. Referring to V404 Cyg, Dr. Narayan said, ''This star seems to be swallowing nearly a hundred times as much energy as it radiates, and the only way this can happen is if the star is a true black hole.''</p>
        <p>Two other reports on black hole research are being discussed at this week's astronomy conference. A team of American and German scientists announced observations of a new black-hole candidate, GRS 1915+105, made by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite. The observations appeared to be consistent with predictions made by a Stanford University team about how the disk of dust and gas that forms around a black hole should vibrate in distinctive ways. Such a signature, astronomers said, should help determine the mass and rotation rate of black holes with greater accuracy.</p>
        <p>Scientists at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M., described new radiotelescope studies of water molecules in a disk around a suspected black hole at the center of the galaxy NGC 4258. They said the research made it possible to deduce the exact location of the object the disk is orbiting and measure the distance between the black hole and the innermost observable portions of high-speed jets of energy shooting out from the galactic core.</p>
