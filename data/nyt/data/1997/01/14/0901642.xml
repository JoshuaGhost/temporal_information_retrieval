        <p>It is hard for outsiders, and even for Romanians, to imagine that this city, where whole neighborhoods were razed by the dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, was once a sophisticated urban capital with cutting-edge architecture and an avant-garde artistic movement. But in the 1920's and 30's, Bucharest was a pre-eminent center for modernist architecture, with dazzling white cubist-shaped houses with flat roofs and wide expanses of windows built for the newly rich.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, much of this architecture survived the leveling rampages of Ceausescu, who in the 1970's and 80's destroyed a wide swath of Bucharest's 19th-century inner city. And today, as Romania digs out from its Communist past, the work of Marcel Janco, the painter and architect who designed many of the houses, is being rediscovered in exhibitions, books and the buildings themselves.</p>
        <p>''During the 1930's, Bucharest was filled with modernist structures; even not so rich people built in this style,'' said Magda Carneci, an art historian who recently organized an exhibition of Janco's photos and architectural drawings at the National Gallery in Bucharest. ''It was a fashion -- being with Europe and being with your time.''</p>
        <p>The renewed interest in the Romanian avant-garde is inspired by a realization that Romanian culture had ''good parts, not only the bad,'' Mrs. Carneci said. ''We know that if the Communist period hadn't come, Romanian culture would have looked much better.''</p>
        <p>Romanian artists were in the vanguard of the modernist movement. The sculptor Constantin Brancusi moved from Romania to Paris in the early part of the century, and the less well-known Tristan Tzara and Janco were among the founders of the anti-bourgeois Dada movement in 1916 when they were young art students in Zurich. (In Romanian, Dada is ''yes'' said twice, as well as the word for a child's wooden horse; in relation to the art movement, Ms. Carneci said, it is meant to convey ''an object of the soul.'' )</p>
        <p>From Zurich, Tzara and Janco moved on to Paris, where the Dadaists were soon superseded by the Surrealists. Janco, whom  Mrs. Carneci described as a larger-than-life personality bubbling with enthusiasm for the new esthetics, returned to Bucharest in 1922 determined to transform the cultural life of his home city. He wrote and drew profusely for a new visual arts magazine, Contimporanul, which he helped publish; his distinctive houses began springing up in 1926 along with commercial buildings designed by his followers.</p>
        <p>The architectural ideas of Janco and his colleagues coincided with the development of Bucharest as a city. Until World War I, Bucharest was little more than a market town that served as a crossroads between Turkey and Western Europe. Unlike the Hungarian capital, Budapest, which was conceived as an imperial city in the 1890's and filled with grandiose structures of the Hapsburg empire, Bucharest still had abundant undeveloped land in the 1920's and 30's. With the growth of the oil industry after World War I, there was also plenty of money for construction.</p>
        <p>The main boulevard, Magheru-Balcescu, was lined with tall, lean structures that transformed Bucharest into one of the most compact modernist architectural areas in Europe. The buildings remain to this day but are hard to distinguish behind layers of heavy grime, cracked facades and tangles of overhead wires and signs.</p>
        <p>''Photos from the time they were built show the town looking extremely white, full of air and very elegant,'' said Mrs. Carneci, who edited a recent book, ''Bucharest in the 1920's-1940's: Between Avant-Garde and Modernism.''</p>
        <p>Most of the houses designed by Janco became Government property after the Communists came to power but escaped the demolition orders of Ceausescu because they were scattered through the city. But because they were inhabited by tenants with no money for repairs, they became dilapidated.</p>
        <p>On Mora Street, in one of the oldest quarters of the city, Mrs. Carneci showed a visitor a three-story Janco house that stands in sharp contrast to the narrow cobblestone street and some  nearby ramshackle cottages. Built of reinforced concrete with a flat roof, the house features wide, rectangular windows interspersed with round windows resembling portholes, a signature motif of the 1930's. The balconies of the house are enclosed with iron railings that are also reminiscent of an ocean liner.</p>
        <p>The house is surrounded by a large garden, but everything about the site speaks of neglect. Some of the concrete walls are cracked, and the exterior is a dirty buff color that looks as though it has not been cleaned in 50 years. The trees and plants are also uncared for.</p>
        <p>Another villa, designed for a well-to-do family, was built on three levels with two long balconies running the length of the house. The beige stucco exterior is peeling, and the wood frames of the long windows are cracked.</p>
        <p>But there was a positive side to such neglect, Mrs. Carneci said: ''Because no one had any money, the houses stand as they were originally built.''</p>
        <p>Original iron doors with curvy Art Deco lines remain in place, and there are no additions to the houses.</p>
        <p>As the economy in Bucharest starts to rejuvenate and laws for private ownership are defined, Mrs. Carneci said, many of the Janco houses will become desirable properties.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one such house, which is owned by a Romanian family living in the United States, is on the market for $500,000, a vast amount by Romanian standards.</p>
        <p>With the union of architects, the city government, now controlled by a coalition of parties that back market reforms, is preparing rules mandating that the original design of the 1930's houses be kept, Mrs. Carneci said.</p>
        <p>One purpose of the recent exhibition on Janco, she said, was to increase public awareness of the value of the architecture and the need to preserve it.</p>
        <p>Like Tzara, whose real name was Sammy Rosenstock, Mr. Janco was Jewish. In the early part of the 20th century, anti-Semitic laws made it difficult for Jews to enter Romania's burgeoning business sector, Mrs. Carneci said. Thus the children of some wealthy Jews went into the arts and, like Janco, tried to fight the nationalist spirit of the interwar period.</p>
        <p>As anti-Semitic forces gained power in Romania, Janco permanently left the country in 1940 and settled in Palestine, where he became a leading modern painter and teacher. In 1953 he built Ein Hod, an artists' cooperative village in Israel. Although he never returned to Romania before his death in 1984, he sent albums in an effort to keep in touch with colleagues locked in by Communism.</p>
