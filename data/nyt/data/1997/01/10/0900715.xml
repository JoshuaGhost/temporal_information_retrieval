        <p>Campaign donations from corporations or their officers were crucial in helping Republicans win the most hotly contested races in the last election, according to a study by a Washington research group that lobbies for changes in campaign financing law.</p>
        <p>''This seems to confirm what most Americans believe,'' said Ira Arlook, the director of the study group. ''More and more elections are determined by the highest bidders.''</p>
        <p>The study by Citizen Action also showed that, by far, most of the money collected and spent by political action committees came from corporations. PAC's are set up by companies, labor unions, law firms and other special interests to collect money and make direct donations to candidates.</p>
        <p>Individuals are allowed to donate $1,000 per election to a candidate. But PAC's can donate up to $5,000 per candidate in each election.</p>
        <p>Corporate PAC's accounted for about 65 percent of all PAC donations, while PAC's representing labor unions accounted for 21 percent.</p>
        <p>In the two-year election cycle completed last November, corporate PAC's gave about $139 million to House and Senate candidates, $97.8 million to Republicans and $41.4 million to Democrats.</p>
        <p>Labor union PAC's, often regarded as the counterpart to corporate PAC's, almost always give more heavily to Democrats than to Republicans. In the last election, labor PAC's gave $46.3 million, all but $3.7 million to Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>But political action committees representing corporations are not always as partisan. While they gave more heavily to Republicans in the last election, Republicans were also the majority party, and incumbents always attract more money than challengers. When the Democrats last controlled Congress four years ago, corporate PAC's split their donations about evenly between the two parties, Citizen Action said.</p>
        <p>Citizen Action's report found that Republicans seemed more adept at directing money to critical races.</p>
        <p>In the 10 closest races won by Republicans in the House, the winning candidate outspent the Democratic opponent by an average of $371,000. In the 10 closest races won by Democrats, the margins of victory were far wider, and Republicans still outspent Democrats by an average of $94,000.</p>
        <p>In the current House, Republicans outnumber Democrats, 227 to 207. There is one independent. In the last Congress, Republicans held a 37-seat majority in the House.</p>
        <p>''The common thread tying the Republicans' successes together was the ability of their candidates to put superior resources into their 'must win' campaigns,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>The study also found that banks and the security and finance industry were the leading source of campaign money in the last election cycle, donating more than $63 million. The health industry was next, followed by lawyers and lobbyists and their PAC's, who themselves may represent a variety of interests before the legislative branch.</p>
