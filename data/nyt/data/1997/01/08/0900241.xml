        <p>Expect to see a lot of Babyface at the Grammy Awards ceremony next month. Twelve songs or albums with contributions by the singer, songwriter and producer were among the nominees for the 39th annual Grammy Awards, announced yesterday at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.</p>
        <p>In some categories, Babyface worked on four out of the five albums or songs nominated: from the ''Waiting to Exhale'' soundtrack he wrote and produced to the Toni Braxton album ''Secrets'' and the Eric Clapton song ''Change the World,'' both of which he produced. The only other artist ever to have received as many Grammy nominations in one year was Michael Jackson, who also garnered 12 after his ''Thriller'' album was released in 1983.</p>

        <p>Expect to see a lot of Babyface at the Grammy Awards ceremony next month. Twelve songs or albums with contributions by the singer, songwriter and producer were among the nominees for the 39th annual Grammy Awards, announced yesterday at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.</p>
        <p>In some categories, Babyface worked on four out of the five albums or songs nominated: from the ''Waiting to Exhale'' soundtrack he wrote and produced to the Toni Braxton album ''Secrets'' and the Eric Clapton song ''Change the World,'' both of which he produced. The only other artist ever to have received as many Grammy nominations in one year was Michael Jackson, who also garnered 12 after his ''Thriller'' album was released in 1983.</p>
        <p>Other artists lavished with nominations included the Smashing Pumpkins, with seven. They will compete with Celine Dion, who got five nominations, for record of the year and album of the year. Tracy Chapman and Vince Gill also received five nominations.</p>
        <p>The Grammy Awards will be presented on Feb. 26 at Madison Square Garden. The ceremony will be broadcast on CBS, with Ellen DeGeneris, who was the host last year, returning.</p>
        <p>The Beatles stand to receive their first Grammy since 1967, when ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' won album of the year. Their new song, ''Free as a Bird,'' was nominated for best pop performance by a duo or group with vocal and for best music video, short form, and the video collection ''The Beatles Anthology'' is in the running for best music video, long form. Even more unusual, Hillary Rodham Clinton, though no stranger to nominations, could become the first First Lady to win a Grammy, for her audio version of ''It Takes a Village,'' which will be competing for best spoken-word or nonmusical album.</p>
        <p>Long accused of being out of touch with important contemporary music and honoring middle-of-the-road albums, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences began using a 25-member panel of music experts last year to review and approve the nominations made by the academy's entire voting body in the top four categories: album of the year, record of the year (awarded to a song), song of the year (for a songwriter) and best new artist. As a result, a spate of new names appeared among last year's nominations, and that has happened again.</p>
        <p>Beck, whose album ''Odelay'' was a critical favorite but not a commercial success, will be competing with Ms. Dion, the Fugees, the Smashing Pumpkins and the ''Waiting to Exhale'' soundtrack for album of the year. He also received nominations for best alternative performance and best male rock vocal performance.</p>
        <p>Other Grammy newcomers, most with multiple nominations, include the Tony Rich Project, Garbage, Jewel, LeAnn Rimes and No Doubt (all of whom will be competing for best new artist) as well as, in other categories, Oasis, Gillian Welch, BR5-49, Tracy Bonham, the Wallflowers, Korn and Dark Latin Groove.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Mr. Clapton's, the nominees for record of the year are by artists who came to prominence in the past decade. They are ''Because You Loved Me'' by Ms. Dion, ''Ironic'' by Alanis Morissette, ''Give Me One Reason'' by Tracy Chapman, ''1979'' by the Smashing Pumpkins and ''Change the World'' by Mr. Clapton. Notably, ''Macarena,'' the best-selling single of last year, received no nominations in any category.</p>
        <p>In the jazz categories, the recording academy remained conservative, largely ignoring the influx and diversity of younger musicians playing in a mainstream style. And in the classical categories, the honors went to contemporary music, with all but one nominee (''Opera Arias'' sung by Bryn Terfel) in the best classical album and best orchestral performance categories taken from the work of 20th-century composers. In addition, one new category was created, best small ensemble performance (with or without conductor), allowing Pierre Boulez to earn a fourth nomination this year, for his composition ''. . . Explosante-Fixe . . . ,'' and bringing the total number of Grammy categories up to 89.</p>
        <p>It may seem odd that two of the biggest contenders at the Grammys, the Smashing Pumpkins album ''Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness'' and the ''Waiting to Exhale'' soundtrack, were released in 1995, but music released between Oct. 1, 1995, and Sept. 30, 1996, is eligible for the Grammys.</p>
        <p>In the coming month, some 9,000 members of the academy will vote on the winners. This year, the awards ceremony will return to Manhattan, after having spent the last two years in Los Angeles. Tickets to the ceremony will not be available to the public.</p>
        <p>Present at the press conference to announce the nominees were Busta Rhymes, Jewel, Suzanne Vega, Richard Marx, Steven Curtis Chapman and B. B. King, who proved that not all pop music is ubiquitous, when he turned to Ms. Vega for help pronouncing Celine Dion's first name and was corrected by Jewel after getting stuck on Ms. Morissette's last name.</p>
