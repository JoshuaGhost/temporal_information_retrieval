        <p>The Giants' interview process for a new coach seems to be over. Next comes the contemplative phase, when management decides just who it is it wants to hire.</p>
        <p>Giants General Manager George Young is apparently sticking to the timetable of hiring a coach sometime next week. There were rumors that the Giants were going to bring in someone tomorrow -- either a new candidate or a person returning for a second interview -- but that is apparently untrue. What you see with the Giants in their effort to replace Dan Reeves is what you get.</p>
        <p>And what you get are these candidates who have had interviews with Young: Jim Fassel, an Arizona assistant; Joe Bugel, an Oakland assistant; Emmitt Thomas, a Philadelphia assistant, and Nick Saban, the head coach at Michigan State. Saban, the last to be interviewed, met with the Giants in New Jersey for about four hours Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Fassel remains the favorite to become the next Giants coach. For Young, the next step is to recommend his choice to ownership and that should happen either late this week or early next week. After that, would come the announcement.</p>
        <p>But the Giants have been involved in other things besides a coaching search. One issue concerns linebacker Corey Miller.</p>
        <p>Miller's agent, Ray Anderson, has contacted the Giants about re-doing Miller's contract, possibly to make it more salary-cap friendly. Young confirmed he has spoken to Anderson. Miller, a pass rusher who often played out of position under Reeves, is in the second year of a four-year deal that will pay him $1.7 million next season. The Giants also signed three players from their practice squad to their active roster: defensive tackle Darnell Hilliard, running back Robert Walker and receiver Kevin Alexander.</p>
        <p>Finally, the Giants have lost another defensive coach to the Washington Redskins. Earl Leggett, the defensive line coach, follows right behind Mike Nolan, the defensive coordinator.</p>
