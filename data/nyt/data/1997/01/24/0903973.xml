        <p>The South Carolina House of Representatives dealt a debilitating blow today to Gov. David Beasley's proposal to remove the Confederate battle flag from atop the dome of the Capitol.</p>
        <p>Widening the schism between Republicans over the flag, the Republican-controlled House rejected the Republican Governor's proposal and instead passed a bill calling for a statewide referendum on the issue in November. Leaders of the Senate, where the Democrats have a majority, oppose that measure, and it is unclear whether a compromise can be reached.</p>
        <p>South Carolina is the only state that flies the Confederate battle flag over its Capitol, a gesture that many whites see as a tribute to their Southern heritage but that many blacks see as a symbol of latent racism. The flag was first raised over the Capitol in 1962, largely to express defiance of the civil rights movement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beasley, the great-great-great-grandson of a Confederate soldier, supported the continued flying of the flag when he was running for Governor in 1994, and in a nonbinding referendum that year, 3 out of 4 voters in that year's Republican primary agreed with him.</p>
        <p>But the Governor, 39, surprised many of his supporters last November by calling for a compromise that would move the flag to a Confederate memorial on the Capitol grounds. Mr. Beasley said that after a series of racial incidents in the state, including arsons at black churches, he concluded that extremists had misappropriated the flag. Business leaders, many with close ties to Mr. Beasley, have called for removing the flag as a way to stimulate investment in the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beasley's proposal set off an incendiary political debate that has brought both flag-supporting Klansmen and flag-opposing clergymen to demonstrations at the Capitol in the early days of the 1997 legislative session. Legislators complain that the rest of their agenda, including efforts to improve schools and roads, has been paralyzed by the public's preoccupation with the flag issue.</p>
        <p>At a Judiciary Committee meeting on Wednesday, racial sensitivities  were rubbed raw.</p>
        <p>State Representative John Graham Altman, a Republican from Charleston, told his colleagues that he would lower the flag himself if doing so ''would solve any of the pathology that infects some segments of the black population.</p>
        <p>''Quit looking at the symbols,'' Mr. Altman said. ''Get out and get a job. Quit shooting each other. Quit having illegitimate babies.''</p>
        <p>His comments provoked angry reactions from black legislators.</p>
        <p>''This type of comment is an insult to me, to my wife and to my grandchildren,'' said State Representative Kenneth Kennedy, a black Democrat from Greeleyville.</p>
        <p>Even the House Speaker, David H. Wilkins, a Republican from Greenville, gently chastised his colleague, saying, ''I think any comment that raises the emotional level on this issue, which is already at a high pitch, is something we should refrain from doing.''</p>
        <p>The referendum bill, which passed by 85 to 32 after more than four hours of debate, would allow voters in November to decide whether the flag should be lowered. The House voted 72 to 45 to kill an amendment that would have substituted Mr. Beasley's proposal for the referendum.</p>
        <p>The referendum would not offer the option of removing the flag to a Confederate monument, a limitation that many assume would diminish its chances of success. A poll taken last month by Mason-Dixon Opinion/ Research showed that 48 percent of state respondents favored lowering the flag while 41 percent wanted it to continue to fly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beasley said today that he continued to believe that the General Assembly should decide the issue. But he said he was pleased that the House had kept the issue alive.</p>
        <p>''To use a sports metaphor, this ends the first inning of a nine-inning ball game,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Democratic leaders in the Senate said they were not likely to support a referendum and predicted that they would pass Mr. Beasley's proposal.</p>
        <p>''I'm totally opposed to a referendum and I'll do anything I can to stop it,'' said the Senate majority leader, John C. Land 3d, Democrat of Manning.</p>
        <p>One thing that Democrats and Republicans seemed to agree on today was that the vote represented a significant setback for Mr. Beasley, who faces re-election in 1998.</p>
        <p>''There's obviously a rift, a difference of opinion among the Republicans, and it remains to be seen how much political capital the Governor will lose because of this initiative,'' said State Representative Jerry N. Govan Jr., Democrat of Orangeburg.</p>
        <p>State Senator Glenn F. McConnell, a Republican from Charleston, noted that the worst outcome for Mr. Beasley would be to propose an initiative that offends much of his political base, and then lose the fight to pass it. That happened in Georgia in 1993, when Gov. Zell Miller proposed removing the Stars and Bars from his state's flag and then failed to push the bill through the Legislature. Mr. Miller barely won re-election the next year, and the closeness of the race was attributed at least partly to his position on the flag.</p>
        <p>Referring to Governor Beasley, Senator McConnell said, ''I think he's suffering grave political damage out of this.''</p>
