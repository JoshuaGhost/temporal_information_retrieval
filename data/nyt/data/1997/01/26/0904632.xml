        <p>THE MEMBER OF THE WEDDING, a new adaptation of the novel by Carson McCuller, is about a young girl's coming of age in a Southern town, where the paragon of femininity is the languorous, delicate female wearing a coif and pearls. Alfre Woodard stars with Anna Paquin (above), who plays Frankie Adams, the girl in question, a hyperactive tomboy whose sense of self is shattered when her long-absent brother brings home his gorgeous fiancee. Frankie, whose hair is worn chopped at the ears and who often demonstrates her alarming talent as the best knife thrower in town, must reconcile her own sense of being, and her attempts to ''grow up'' lead to moments of danger, despair and, finally, a curious form of peace - WEDNESDAY at 9 P.M. on USA.</p>
