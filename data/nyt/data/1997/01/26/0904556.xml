        <p>Last May, the Amtrak railroad tracks that run through Clinton were surrounded by a growing neighborhood blight of rats, garbage and tottering huts built by homeless people on steep embankments.</p>
        <p>Since then, in large part due to an unusual coalition of the Police Department, the Midtown Community Court, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Sanitation, and Community Board 4, as well as Amtrak, many of the problems have been addressed and reduced. The huts were removed and an effort was made to resettle the homeless. Garbage was stored, and rats were exterminated.</p>
        <p>But it is a measure of the severity of the problems that community groups are now blaming Amtrak not only for blocking long-term solutions but also for allowing problems to crop up again and hiding behind questions like who owns the land next to the tracks. Recently, two homeless encampments reappeared on the west embankment between 42d and 43d Streets. One burned down last week. Community Board 4 says Amtrak has worsened the situation by banning social workers from the Midtown Community Court from coaxing the homeless into apartments or shelters.</p>
        <p>For its part, Amtrak said the embankment was too steep to allow non-Amtrak personnel on the premises. ''We could not allow civilians to go into this dangerous envelope,'' said Richard Rubel, community relations officer for the New York office of Amtrak.</p>
        <p>Said John Feinblatt, coordinator for the Midtown Community Court: ''Of course, safety issues are valid. But we would still like to work with this group of homeless people.''</p>
        <p>Amtrak has hampered the work of cleaning up the area near the tracks, said Jessica Greer, district manager for the community board. ''It's been like pulling teeth,'' she said of her relations with Amtrak. ''I've had to become a complete kvetch.''</p>
        <p>But Amtrak officials say they are not being given enough credit for their work. Last year, the railroad spent $850,000 to clear debris and find homes for more than 100 homeless people living near Amtrak tracks between West 72d and 123d Streets, Mr. Rubel said.</p>
        <p>Later this year, he said, Amtrak will begin a $900,000 plan to clean up the tracks from 33d to 72d Streets. Meanwhile, Mr. Rubel said Amtrak had worked closely with the community board and city agencies to pick up garbage, exterminate rats and ease the homeless out of their encampments.</p>
        <p>Trying to determine who owns the land next to the Amtrak tracks is not mere legalism, Mr. Rubel said. Amtrak owns the tracks and the space 18 feet up, but an inspection of city records shows no uniform Amtrak ownership of the land adjacent to the tracks, he said.</p>
        <p>In many cases, he said, adjacent apartment buildings and homes own the land. In the case of the two homeless encampments, the city owns the property and must be responsible for it, he added.</p>
        <p>''Amtrak wants to be a good neighbor,'' Mr. Rubel said. ''But Amtrak has limited resources. I can't commit to do work on other people's property.''</p>
