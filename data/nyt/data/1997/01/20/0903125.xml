        <p>Faced with a political crisis that has brought huge crowds of protesters onto the streets, the new President of Bulgaria, Petar Stoyanov, was sworn in today.</p>
        <p>He immediately called for new parliamentary elections, a major demand of the demonstrators, and said politicians who had ''robbed the country'' should be punished.</p>
        <p>Speaking before Parliament, Mr. Stoyanov suggested that corrupt politicians had caused the country's economic collapse, which has left most Bulgarians living at subsistence level and put nearly half of the banks into receivership.</p>
        <p>''The people on the streets have shown us what to do,'' he told Parliament, where the former Communists who are the target of the demonstrators sat stony-faced. ''They are out there because they are desperately poor and because there have only been imitations of reform -- and corruption.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stoyanov, 44, a divorce lawyer and onetime star volleyball player, was elected by a wide margin in November in a protest vote against the governing Socialist Party, whose members made up the core of the former Communist Party.</p>
        <p>As a previously little-known member of the opposition party, the United Democratic Forces, Mr. Stoyanov represents a new image for Bulgaria. But his inauguration highlighted the country's political standoff.</p>
        <p>A demonstration that was to have coincided with his swearing-in was canceled in an effort to avoid a repetition of the police attacks on protesters during a siege of Parliament 10 days ago.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Stoyanov addressed a crowd of the protesters -- and celebrators -- who gathered outside Alexander Nevsky Cathedral this afternoon. In his speech, he repeated his call for an end to official corruption.</p>
        <p>The political turmoil came to a boil on Jan. 10, when the Socialist Party members in Parliament -- whose popular support, two public opinion surveys released last week indicate, has dropped to less than 10 percent -- refused to vote on an opposition motion calling for new elections. The opposition then walked out of Parliament.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the retiring President, Zhelyu M. Zhelev, also a member of the opposition party, refused to allow the Socialists to form a new government. Mr. Zhelev cited the discontent on the streets and the economic crisis.</p>
        <p>The country had been without a government since just before Christmas, when the Socialist Prime Minister, Zhan V. Videnov, resigned. Mr. Videnov, a hard-line former Communist, was blamed by many Bulgarians for the economic disaster.</p>
        <p>The Socialists nominated Nikolai Dobrev, the Interior Minister, to be Prime Minister, but Mr. Zhelev insisted that the Socialists reach an accommodation with the opposition on new elections and an economic program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stoyanov has been negotiating behind the scenes to find a solution. But his task has been difficult because the two parties, which totally mistrust each other, are themselves in turmoil with factions and internal fights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stoyanov said on Friday that his constitutional obligations might force him to let the Socialists form a new government, but today he seemed to have softened that approach.</p>
        <p>What is at stake for Bulgaria is whether the country can begin to build economic stability.</p>
        <p>The International Monetary Fund has stipulated that the only answer is the introduction of a currency board, but the fund has refused to help create one until a new government is in place. The board would set a fixed exchange rate for the currency and forbid the national bank to print any more money.</p>
        <p>Such austere measures, which worked in Argentina, would in the short term bring even more misery for the population. Economists say, though, that in six months or so the economy would begin to normalize.</p>
        <p>Western bankers have estimated that more than $7 billion of state money has been siphoned off since 1990, much of it thought to be in private bank accounts.</p>
        <p>In a searing speech to the Socialist Party congress just before he was nominated as Prime Minister, Mr. Dobrev openly spoke of the corruption by his colleagues.</p>
        <p>''Didn't we know that many state enterprises took credits without any intention of paying back their obligations?'' he asked. ''Was it not clear that the parvenu private bankers, living like oil sheiks, have neither the culture nor the ability to direct and manage these banks? Why didn't we dismiss the directors who emptied the state enterprises and filled their own bank accounts with the proceeds?''</p>
        <p>Ivan Krustev, the director of an independent political think tank, the Center for Liberal Strategies, said Mr. Dobrev's analysis was in many ways the crux of the matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krustev said one of the principal reasons that the Socialists were refusing to give up power was their financial interest. ''There's a lot of money at stake,'' Mr. Krustev said. ''Some people have two opportunities: to sit in Parliament or to sit in prison. Parliament may not be a nice place, but it's better for them than prison.''</p>
