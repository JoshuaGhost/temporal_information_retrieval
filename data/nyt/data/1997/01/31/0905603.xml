        <p>Judge Leonard N Arnold approves abortion request of prison inmate Sonya Jackson, after taking unusual step of appointing lawyer for her fetus; ACLU objects to appointment of legal guardian for fetus (New Jersey Daily Briefings)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>After taking the unusual step of appointing a lawyer for a fetus, a Superior Court judge ruled yesterday that an inmate could go ahead with her abortion. The inmate, Sonya Jackson, who is in the second trimester of her pregnancy, had asked the judge, Leonard N. Arnold, for reduced bail so that she could leave jail for an abortion, but the judge told her that the fetus was entitled to legal representation.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after hearing arguments from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the judge decided that he had no right to block the abortion. He ordered Ms. Jackson, who was charged with drug dealing, released for the abortion and then returned to jail. David Rocah, staff attorney for the A.C.L.U., said that no judge had ever appointed a legal guardian for a fetus without being overturned and called Judge Arnold's appointment ''a travesty'' that violated the state and Federal Constitutions.</p>
