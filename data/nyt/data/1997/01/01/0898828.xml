      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The arrest of a freelance German operative in Colombia has raised questions about the personality and style of the man who allegedly sent him there -- Bernd Schmidbauer, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's senior intelligence aide.</p>
        <p>The incident has also given Germans a rare peek into deeds committed in their name that seem to bypass this country's usual regard for rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidbauer occupies what commentators call a gray world between high office and dubious means. He is entrusted with coordinating the activities of Germany's intelligence agencies and keeping the Chancellor apprised of what he thinks Mr. Kohl needs to know.</p>
        <p>The operative in Colombia, Werner Mauss, was arrested in November, along with his wife, for associating with guerrillas to free a German hostage being held for ransom. The discovery of the operation infuriated Colombian authorities, who have tried to strangle the flow of ransom to guerrillas.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Schmidbauer suggested, the protection of Germans lives took precedence over those concerns. ''We will have more cases where German citizens are taken hostage,'' he said. ''We are obliged in those emergency circumstances to help. I am grateful to all who who have helped me. That applies especially to Mauss, who has helped us on many occasions to rescue German hostages from Colombia.''</p>
        <p>As a member of Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratic Union with ministerial rank, Mr. Schmidbauer belongs to a coterie of advisers who operate close to Mr. Kohl.</p>
        <p>He maintains largely unchronicled links with an array of shadowy figures, including the heads of Israeli and Iranian intelligence. German officials contend that the contacts provide unique opportunities for him to intercede where other Westerners cannot.</p>
        <p>The operation in Colombia thrust Mr. Schmidbauer into a limelight he has claimed before in more positive settings -- like an exchange of prisoners between Israel and Lebanon last July, which he said he was able to mastermind because of high-level contacts in Iran.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Schmidbauer has his critics. A former director of Germany's Federal Intelligence Service, akin to the C.I.A., has questioned Mr. Schmidbauer's use of a freelance agent to conduct what he termed ''this delicate mission.'' Others, including editorial writers, have questioned how exactly Mr. Schmidbauer's job is defined and whether the role is properly served by such a high-profile figure.</p>
        <p>People in his position, said Hans-Jurgen Wischnewski, a former Government troubleshooter from the opposition Social Democrats, should ''remain discreetly in the background.''</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Schmidbauer seems able to rely on an unwritten convention that, in secret matters involving German lives, the country's spy masters should be given some leeway. Even Mr. Wischnewski acknowledged that ''in such situations, you cannot always avoid breaking the law.''</p>
        <p>The fact that no German legislator has called for his resignation, Mr. Schmidbauer argued, illustrates a broad consensus in Parliament that ''unconventional procedures for the solution of humanitarian problems are justified.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Schmidbauer has told German reporters, referring to Mr. and Mrs. Mauss, ''We will not leave them in the lurch.''</p>
