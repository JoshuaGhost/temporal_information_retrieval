        <p>Chemo. While his Baltimore teammates were en route to Cleveland, Eric Davis had taken his latest treatment for colon cancer. He felt tired, but he insisted on playing in the third game of the American League Championship Series, and went hitless in four at-bats before being removed in the ninth inning of the Indians' eventual 2-1 victory in 12 innings.</p>

        <p>THE word slips into the news conference, heavier than most of the banal words spoken at these rituals. Chemo. Normally, it is a word for other sections of the paper, or other segments of the television news, but here it is, coming amid talk of third-game starters and three-day rests and other such trivia.</p>
        <p>Chemo. While his Baltimore teammates were en route to Cleveland, Eric Davis had taken his latest treatment for colon cancer. He felt tired, but he insisted on playing in the third game of the American League Championship Series, and went hitless in four at-bats before being removed in the ninth inning of the Indians' eventual 2-1 victory in 12 innings.</p>
        <p>Davis graciously gave a mass interview before the game, describing the fan he had encountered outside Jacobs Field: ''A real Cleveland fan wearing all the Indians colors -- but holding a banner that said, 'We Love You, Eric,' in red, white and blue. I didn't know how to take it. I'm not hungry for it, but I appreciate it.''</p>
        <p>He wants to get back to the business of being a full-time ballplayer, but he knows he can no longer be the same. ''I am a statistic now,'' he said yesterday. ''It's glorifying. The patients see me, and I see the electricity in their faces, and it lights me up, too.''</p>
        <p>His life changed in this town in June when he felt stomach pains and went in for some simple tests. Within days, he had a cancerous growth removed, as well as a third of his colon, in mid-June. ''I didn't anticipate coming back,'' he said yesterday. ''I just took it day by day, until the doctors gave me a clean bill of health. The hardest thing was waiting for the incisions to heal.''</p>
        <p>He came back in September, first as a statement of his will, but now he is back doing what he knows best: ''Eric had his chemo Thursday night,'' the manager will say. Or ''Eric is a little tired from the chemo.''</p>
        <p>Davis had played Thursday night in the 5-4 loss to the Indians, and then had gone directly to the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center for the 11th of a series of 18 treatments. For 2 hours 15 minutes, he munched popcorn and watched a video of ''Major League 2'' and reported, ''It was great.''</p>
        <p>While his teammates were unwinding in their individual fashions, Davis was having an intravenous needle attached to his left arm, and the dosage of the cancer-fighting fluid (which he calls ''poison'') would filter into his system. Chemotherapy leaves some patients weak and others downright sick to their stomachs. Few cancer patients can imagine going out and swinging at a baseball moving 90 miles an hour while in the middle of chemotherapy sessions.</p>
        <p>''You've got to imagine his courage and dedication,'' said Mike Hargrove, the Indians' manager. ''I don't think any of us who haven't undergone what he has undergone have any idea what it takes. I hope I never find out. I admire him.''</p>
        <p>Davis will accept the praise from peers like Hargrove but is itching to be treated as the old Eric Davis, a 35-year-old outfielder who never quite became Willie Mays or Junior Griffey, partially because of all his injuries. Now he reaches back for a reserve and maturity he never had to use before.</p>
        <p>He has made himself available to cancer patients like David Ryan, a young man with leukemia. Davis said, ''He's battling for his life, and he's upbeat, and I'm not nearly as ill as he is.''</p>
        <p>Several Baltimore reporters were allowed to accompany him for his previous treatment last Friday, hours after an overnight flight from Seattle. He joked with patients and staff members alike.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people go through the back door,'' Sherry Janney of Fredericksburg, Va., a cancer patient, told Ken Rosenthal of The Baltimore Sun. ''They don't want anyone to see them. For him to come out here with all these people, sit here, give autographs, not hide, that says something right there.''</p>
        <p>Davis tries to play down this compassionate side. He said he eats whatever he wants, as often as he wants, and while he receives love from his family, ''They don't give me no sympathy at home,'' which made him smile. He's trying to put the illness behind him.</p>
        <p>''I don't have cancer,'' he said. ''I had cancer.'' In his long career, he has taken a great deal of treatment for everything from a lacerated kidney to broken bones and torn muscles. Most athletes become medical experts processes like an m.r.i. or arthroscopic surgery. Now Eric Davis is experiencing a new medical treatment. Chemo.</p>
