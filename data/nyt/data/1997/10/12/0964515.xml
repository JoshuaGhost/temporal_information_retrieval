        <p>David Schmitt, a waiter at Broadway Joe's, often gets double takes from baffled customers who think he is Harrison Ford.</p>
        <p>''I'm told the more flustered I am, the more I act like him,'' says Mr. Schmitt, who stood in for Mr. Ford in ''The Devil's Own.''</p>

        <p>David Schmitt, a waiter at Broadway Joe's, often gets double takes from baffled customers who think he is Harrison Ford.</p>
        <p>''I'm told the more flustered I am, the more I act like him,'' says Mr. Schmitt, who stood in for Mr. Ford in ''The Devil's Own.''</p>
        <p>''I guess when I'm bombarded on a Saturday night with customers, I look like a figure in an action movie.''</p>
        <p>Donna Desideri has dyed her long brunet hair blond, learned to chain- smoke and donned an eye patch as a stand-in for Stockard Channing in the movies ''Six Degrees of Separation'' and ''Smoke.'' Ms. Desideri, who has been told since college that she resembles the actress, has a director's chair with Ms. Channing's name on it in her Upper West Side studio apartment, a gift from the ''Six Degrees'' movie crew.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmitt and Ms. Desideri belong to an unheralded, often low-paid club: celebrity look-alikes who work in film and television.</p>
        <p>Stand-ins, who have the same height, weight and physical qualities of the star, walk through scenes for lighting and blocking purposes while the star is busy with makeup, hairstyling or wardrobe.</p>
        <p>Doubles resemble the leading actors more closely, sometimes eerily so, and take their place in nonspeaking long-distance shots.</p>
        <p>Some are regulars for certain actors. But others are more versatile. Marie Gabrielle lay in a pool of blood (Karo corn syrup and food coloring) for Sean Young in ''A Kiss Before Dying.'' She also stood in for Melanie Griffith in ''A Stranger Among Us'' and for Andie MacDowell in the forthcoming romantic comedy ''Piece of Cake.''</p>
        <p>In the opening minutes of ''The Juror,'' that was Wills Robbins, standing in for Alec Baldwin shooting a mobster and a child to death. But Mr. Robbins also did scenes for Hugh Grant in ''Extreme Measures'' and for Timothy Hutton in ''Q &amp; A.''</p>
        <p>The standard Screen Actors Guild rate for a stand-in or double is $109 for an eight-hour shift, only $10 more than extras get. Stunt doubles earn much more, especially if the work is dangerous.</p>
        <p>Calvin Brown has doubled for Bill Cosby on and off since 1965, starting with the television series ''I Spy.'' ''Whenever you saw him fighting, running or wrecking a car, I did it,'' says Mr. Brown. For ''Top Secret,'' a 1992 TV movie, Mr. Brown jumped out of a helicopter onto a moving bus. He now enjoys a more sedentary role as a double on ''Cosby.''</p>
        <p>Actors say such gigs hone their technical skills, offer networking opportunities and put food on the table while they seek acting jobs.</p>
        <p>''It beats any class I've ever taken -- I just watch her,'' Ms. Desideri said of Ms. Channing. But there is a downside: ''You may spend your time watching other people's careers.''</p>

        <p>NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: NEW YORK UP CLOSE  Correction:  October 26, 1997, Sunday</p>
        <p>A chart in the Neighborhood Report on Oct. 12 about actors who work as doubles or stand-ins for better-known peformers reversed the identifications of two actors. Donna Desideri was shown at upper left, Marie Gabrielle at upper right.</p>
