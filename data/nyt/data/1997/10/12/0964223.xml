        <p>ALL AROUND ATLANTIS: Stories, by Deborah Eisenberg. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) Many of these spirited, powerful stories concern children, affluent and neglected, whose precocious perceptions outrun their power to articulate them.</p>
        <p>THE BOOK OF FAMOUS IOWANS, by Douglas Bauer. (Holt, $25.) A painful and, by design, redemptive novel whose hero explores the rage at his parents' betrayal that has dominated his life.</p>
        <p>CALIFORNIA'S OVER, by Louis B. Jones. (Pantheon, $24.) A satirical elegy for hippiedom and the narcissistic hypersincerity of the 1970's, set in an innocent Marin County where mellowness grows as grows the grass.</p>
        <p>THE CLAIRVOYANT, by Marian Thurm. (Zoland, $23.95.) An amusing novel with an amusing proposition: its title character, a psychic loose cannon who can't control what he sees, suffers from the resulting mystery deficit in his love life.</p>
        <p>THE COMPLETE STORIES, by Bernard Malamud. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $35.) The whole megillah: 55 stories, from grim early tales of mercantile existence to complex bantering that ends in profound choices, all of them as Jewish as he knew how to make them.</p>
        <p>EUROPE ADRIFT, by John Newhouse. (Pantheon, $27.50.) A sagacious and experienced scholar and consultant sees a Europe all adrift, led by leaders who won't lead or can't, especially since German reunification shifted the balance eastward.</p>
        <p>THE FABRIC OF REALITY: The Science of Parallel Universes -- and Its Implications, by David Deutsch. (Allen Lane/Penguin, $29.95.) A literate, refreshing argument that quantum theory describes how things really are, not just how they may be mathematically described.</p>
        <p>HOW THE MIND WORKS, by Steven Pinker. (Norton, $29.95.) There's no blank slate, this M.I.T. psychologist believes; we are born with programmed learning modules, without which we'd flounder computationally, never acquiring impossible skills like talking and walking.</p>
        <p>LEGENDS OF THE AMERICAN DESERT: Sojourns in the Greater Southwest, by Alex Shoumatoff. (Knopf, $30.) A frothy, unkempt, beguiling omnium-gatherum that ranges from Mexico City to southern Colorado.</p>
        <p>MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, by Arthur Golden. (Knopf, $25.) This first novel, a bold act of ventriloquism, takes as subject a Japanese woman born in the 1920's; her recollections are enriched with all sorts of colorful period detail.</p>
        <p>PILGRIMS, by Elizabeth Gilbert. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) Chaucer is invoked in this lively short-story collection, but its characters have little patience for long-windedness or spirituality; they are mostly down and out, and often very odd.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>ALL AROUND ATLANTIS: Stories, by Deborah Eisenberg. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $23.) Many of these spirited, powerful stories concern children, affluent and neglected, whose precocious perceptions outrun their power to articulate them.</p>
        <p>THE BOOK OF FAMOUS IOWANS, by Douglas Bauer. (Holt, $25.) A painful and, by design, redemptive novel whose hero explores the rage at his parents' betrayal that has dominated his life.</p>
        <p>CALIFORNIA'S OVER, by Louis B. Jones. (Pantheon, $24.) A satirical elegy for hippiedom and the narcissistic hypersincerity of the 1970's, set in an innocent Marin County where mellowness grows as grows the grass.</p>
        <p>THE CLAIRVOYANT, by Marian Thurm. (Zoland, $23.95.) An amusing novel with an amusing proposition: its title character, a psychic loose cannon who can't control what he sees, suffers from the resulting mystery deficit in his love life.</p>
        <p>THE COMPLETE STORIES, by Bernard Malamud. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $35.) The whole megillah: 55 stories, from grim early tales of mercantile existence to complex bantering that ends in profound choices, all of them as Jewish as he knew how to make them.</p>
        <p>EUROPE ADRIFT, by John Newhouse. (Pantheon, $27.50.) A sagacious and experienced scholar and consultant sees a Europe all adrift, led by leaders who won't lead or can't, especially since German reunification shifted the balance eastward.</p>
        <p>THE FABRIC OF REALITY: The Science of Parallel Universes -- and Its Implications, by David Deutsch. (Allen Lane/Penguin, $29.95.) A literate, refreshing argument that quantum theory describes how things really are, not just how they may be mathematically described.</p>
        <p>HOW THE MIND WORKS, by Steven Pinker. (Norton, $29.95.) There's no blank slate, this M.I.T. psychologist believes; we are born with programmed learning modules, without which we'd flounder computationally, never acquiring impossible skills like talking and walking.</p>
        <p>LEGENDS OF THE AMERICAN DESERT: Sojourns in the Greater Southwest, by Alex Shoumatoff. (Knopf, $30.) A frothy, unkempt, beguiling omnium-gatherum that ranges from Mexico City to southern Colorado.</p>
        <p>MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, by Arthur Golden. (Knopf, $25.) This first novel, a bold act of ventriloquism, takes as subject a Japanese woman born in the 1920's; her recollections are enriched with all sorts of colorful period detail.</p>
        <p>PILGRIMS, by Elizabeth Gilbert. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) Chaucer is invoked in this lively short-story collection, but its characters have little patience for long-windedness or spirituality; they are mostly down and out, and often very odd.</p>
