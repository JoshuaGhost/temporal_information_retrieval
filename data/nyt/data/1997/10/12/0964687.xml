        <p>The camera crews of the White House Communications Agency are active-duty members of the military services, trained to record combat and high-risk training operations for the Pentagon's archives.</p>
        <p>After the criticism the agency has received for making videotapes of President Clinton's White House coffees for big donors to the Democratic Party, and then taking months to find them, its technicians would probably find the burning oil fields of Kuwait a less hostile environment than the nation's capital.</p>

        <p>The camera crews of the White House Communications Agency are active-duty members of the military services, trained to record combat and high-risk training operations for the Pentagon's archives.</p>
        <p>After the criticism the agency has received for making videotapes of President Clinton's White House coffees for big donors to the Democratic Party, and then taking months to find them, its technicians would probably find the burning oil fields of Kuwait a less hostile environment than the nation's capital.</p>
        <p>The tight-lipped technicians of the agency, known around the White House as Wocka, are unaccustomed to the spotlight. Their job is to lay telephone cable, establish secure satellite communications and insure that the President is linked at all times to the military command. They haul around the armored lectern the President uses and are the keepers of the Presidential seal that adorns it.</p>
        <p>A black Wocka communications van accompanies every Presidential motorcade, allowing instant communication with every American military outpost or world capital.</p>
        <p>They also operate the teleprompter.</p>
        <p>A relatively minor part of their assignment is to record Presidential events on video and audio tape for the archives. Most of the tapes, like the one broadcast by ABC News this week of President Reagan entertaining donors in the White House East Room -- are ultimately transferred to Presidential libraries or the National Archives.</p>
        <p>Only about 120 of the agency's 950 employees are in the audiovisual unit. Last year, the $9.8 million audiovisual budget was transferred to White House accounts. The Pentagon continues to pay the remaining $100 million of the agency's budget.</p>
        <p>The Wocka camera crews for the most part travel with the commercial broadcast crews covering the President, although they are allowed to film some events -- like the famous coffees -- that are closed to the news media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has defended the agency's technicians, saying they were military professionals simply doing their job of preserving Presidential events on videotape. He said he had no reason to believe that officials of the agency had deliberately withheld the tapes from Congressional and Justice Department investigators.</p>
        <p>But others in the White House consider the communications group at least partly responsible for the tapes fiasco. Several officials expressed annoyance that the agency's clerks took months to find tapes of the coffees because they had not used the proper search terms in the computerized tape catalogue.</p>
