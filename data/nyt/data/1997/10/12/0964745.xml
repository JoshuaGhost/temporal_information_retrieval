        <p>With its onion-domed churches and imposing walled monastery, this town had long been a symbol of the Russian Orthodox faith. Nestled among quiet streams and woodlands 130 miles east of the hustle and bustle of Moscow, it conveys a quiet serenity.</p>
        <p>But its calm is deceptive. With the stroke of a pen, President Boris N. Yeltsin transformed Suzdal into a potential battleground in Russia's new religious war.</p>
        <p>The conflict pits the Russian Orthodox Church, the dominant faith in Russia and an ally of the Yeltsin Government, against the small breakaway Free Orthodox Church, which describes itself as the true heir of Russia's religious legacy.</p>
        <p>The prize here is control of 15 churches, which the breakaway group, founded in 1991, has been painstakingly restoring to their former glory.</p>
        <p>''We have 15 churches, which the Moscow Patriarchate has always claimed,'' said Archbishop Valentin, the self-proclaimed head of the Free Orthodox Church. ''It does not want the closed and half-destroyed churches in our region. It wants the churches that have been restored from the ruins at our expense and by the hands of our believers.''</p>
        <p>The religious law that Mr. Yeltsin signed on Sept. 26 was not just to protect the Russian Orthodox Church against competition from Roman Catholics, Protestants and other rival faiths from the West. It is also part of a brewing internal struggle for control over Orthodox churches, cathedrals, seminaries and religious schools.</p>
        <p>The Russian Orthodox Church under Patriarch Aleksy II in Moscow insists that it simply wants to protect its spiritual heritage from self-appointed clerics. It has drawn support from the Orthodox Church in America, the largest Orthodox church of Russian descent in the United States, which complains that breakaway groups have gained control of religious property in the confusion that followed the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>''They were built by Russians in the Russian Orthodox Church hundreds of years ago, not by a splinter group,'' Father Daniel Hubiak, the Moscow representative of the Orthodox Church in America, said of the Suzdal churches.</p>
        <p>But critics of the dominant Russian Orthodoxy maintain that its real goal is to stifle dissent within its ranks and wrest religious property from minority Orthodox groups.</p>
        <p>Among those that feel threatened is the pro-Kiev faction of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, which complained about seizure of property just days after the new law was signed. The buildings in question -- a cathedral, seminary, convent and religious school -- are all in Noginsk, a town east of Moscow.</p>
        <p>Another faction, the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, the pro-monarchist emigre church now based in New York, shares concerns about its powerful rival. The emigre group broke with the Moscow Patriarchate in 1927 because of its cooperation with Stalin and other Soviet leaders. It fears that the religious activities it resumed here after the fall of the Soviet Union could be severely restricted, and that it could lose parishes.</p>
        <p>Some Old Believers -- members of an Orthodox faction that opposes liturgical reforms carried out in the 17th century and has maintained its traditions in Russia -- have similar fears. They worry about losing out in the competition to regain icons, bells and other religious property from the state, and about losing some of the property they already have.</p>
        <p>Classic Test Case Of Breakaway Groups</p>
        <p>Even before the new law was passed, the Free Orthodox Church, which is headquartered here, had one church taken away in a nearby town. It fears it may lose more. And although the church is small, other breakaway churches and human rights groups are paying heed.</p>
        <p>Suzdal is ''a classic test case,'' said Father Victor Potapov, rector of the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Washington, D.C., and a member of the emigre church.</p>
        <p>Suzdal is no stranger to power struggles. In its thousand years of recorded history, it has survived invasions, fires and plagues. Ivan the Terrible sent his wife into exile here. So did Peter the Great, the founder of modern Russia.</p>
        <p>During the Soviet era, many of Suzdal's churches were sorely neglected. But Soviet leaders turned the town into a tourist center nonetheless, the better to make hard currency and demonstrate that Moscow allowed a modicum of religious freedom -- under the watchful eyes of the K.G.B.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church, for their part, made their peace with the Communists, even as many individual priests and believers were driven underground. They were allowed to oversee the church and travel abroad in return for echoing the Soviet line on religious ''freedom'' and foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Still, with Russia in search of a new national identity, Russian Orthodoxy has emerged as a symbol of continuity with the country's pre-Communist past. But which brand of Orthodoxy should be allowed to flourish has become a burning question.</p>
        <p>The dispute erupted abroad earlier this year when the Russian Orthodox Church persuaded Yasir Arafat, the head of the Palestinian Authority, to evict expatriate Orthodox monks and nuns from the West Bank town of Hebron's only Christian church and hand over control to the Moscow Patriarchate.</p>
        <p>It has also raged in this town of picturesque churches and monasteries, where the seeds of the current dispute go back to 1972.</p>
        <p>At that time, Archbishop Valentin, then known as Anatoly P. Rusantsev, was assigned here by the Moscow Patriarchate to help spruce up the churches. He had been reared, he said, by religious devotees in the underground church after his father was crippled during World War II and his mother developed mental illness. He spent much of his life within the Soviet-sanctioned church, including a stint as a priest overseeing its operations in Dagestan. By the time he was ordered to Suzdal he had been named archimandrite, a high monastic rank.</p>
        <p>But as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, he had a falling-out with his Moscow superiors and joined the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, a fierce foe of the Communists and the Orthodox clerics who cooperated with them.</p>
        <p>He achieved the rank of bishop in the emigre church, but then left to found the Free Orthodox Church.</p>
        <p>Father Vsevolod Chaplin, a priest in the Moscow Patriarchate's department of external church relations, said that Archbishop Valentin's primary motive was ambition, asserting that he was determined to become a bishop, even if this meant establishing his own church.</p>
        <p>New Religion Law Adds to Obstacles</p>
        <p>Archbishop Valentin insists that he was fed up with the cozy relationship between the Russian Orthodox Church and Soviet intelligence services and no longer wanted to report to the K.G.B. about his overseas trips and meetings with foreigners.</p>
        <p>Today he is leader of the Free Orthodox Church, based here in Suzdal. The church, he said, has 15 churches in the city and 100 parishes under its jurisdiction, nearly all in Russia. It is very much a minority faction; the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church has about 8,000 parishes in Russia and roughly the same number outside of Russia, most in Ukraine.</p>
        <p>Even before the new law was signed, the Free Orthodox Church had its problems. Its church in Moscow is located in a converted morgue on the outskirts of the capital.</p>
        <p>''The government of Moscow did everything in its power to insure we did not get a church closer to the center,'' said Father Mikhail Makeyev, the head of the Moscow parish.</p>
        <p>But with the new religious law, the church is worried that it may not be able to hold onto the churches it already has.</p>
        <p>There is no question that the new law -- signed by President Yeltsin despite American protests -- strengthens the dominance of the established church.</p>
        <p>Under the law, religious organizations like the Russian Orthodox Church, certified by the Government as active for at least 15 years, qualify for a range of rights and privileges.</p>
        <p>These organizations, which would also include older Jewish and Islamic groups, would have the right to own property, control radio and television stations and distribute religious literature. They would be entitled to tax exemptions and could conduct services in hospitals and cemeteries.</p>
        <p>But activities of religious organizations that do not meet the 15-year rule would be restricted. The organizations would also have to re-register with local authorities each year after the registration of all currently recognized religious organizations lapses in 1999.</p>
        <p>The law was overwhelmingly approved in Russia's nationalist Parliament and was backed by Mr. Yeltsin, who enjoyed the tacit support of the Russian Orthodox Church during his 1996 re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>Human rights activists say the measure violates the Russian Constitution, which bans the establishment of a state religion.</p>
        <p>Abuses have already been reported. A Russian Orthodox priest in St. Petersburg lost his job at a seminary after he wrote a letter protesting the law. A Lutheran parish in the Siberian region of Khakassia had its registration revoked. Before the legislation was passed, Pentecostals were evicted from the buildings they rented in Archangel, and the new law has not improved their chances of regaining the premises.</p>
        <p>Even some of the favored faiths have expressed concern. The Union of Councils for Soviet Jews has protested the law, arguing that it will undermine religious freedom in Russia and lead to discrimination against newer Jewish groups.</p>
        <p>The law also provides the Russian Orthodox Church with a valuable weapon against breakaway factions.</p>
        <p>''I think the real target is the Russian Orthodox priest who is unhappy with the church and is thinking about jumping ship and seeking out other jurisdictions,'' said Lawrence Uzzell of the Keston Institute, a private research group headquartered in Oxford, England, that monitors religious freedom in former Communist nations in Eastern Europe.</p>
        <p>Take Suzdal. Since the Free Church officially registered with the Russian authorities in 1991, it does not satisfy the 15-year rule, Archbishop Valentin said.</p>
        <p>Curtailed Activity And Lost Protection</p>
        <p>That means the church would no longer have the right to operate its religious school, which is based in a converted garage formerly used by the K.G.B. It could no longer distribute religious literature or invite foreigners to work here on a permanent basis, undercutting its ability to attract foreign priests.</p>
        <p>It would have the right to own property, but that would not necessarily protect its churches in Suzdal against confiscation. Officially, many old churches are considered cultural monuments and the property of the state. Archbishop Valentin and his priests worry that local authorities may decline to re-register the Free Church and instead turn their churches over to the Moscow Patriarchate.</p>
        <p>The Free Church recently lost a church in Pavlovskoye, a village not far from Suzdal, when the Ministry of Culture transferred it to the jurisdiction of the Moscow Patriarchate.</p>
        <p>The Russian Orthodox Church, for its part, has made clear that it views the Free breakaway faction as little more than squatters.</p>
        <p>''Our church definitely considers these churches as belonging to the Russian Orthodox Church from our ecclesiastic understanding,'' Father Vsevolod Chaplin of the Moscow Patriarchate said of the Suzdal churches.</p>
        <p>Walking through the streets of Suzdal, Archbishop Valentin gestured toward a new religious building that he is having constructed as a meeting place for church leaders and hotel. That, he said, will give him a base in Suzdal if his churches there are taken away. But experts say the issue is much bigger than the future of Archbishop Valentin.</p>
        <p>''I am absolutely sure the Moscow Patriarchate will continue to pursue its efforts to unify the church under its aegis,'' said Andrei Zolotov, Jr., who writes about religion for The Moscow Times. ''It wants to prevent new Valentins from happening.''</p>
