        <p>Think of a Walpurgis-Mart For One-Stop Sorcery</p>
        <p>Just in time for Halloween, Abracadabra has opened at 19 West 21st Street with costumes, props and magic tricks spread out over three levels and 12,000  square feet. The owner, Paul Blum, describes the store, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, as ''a novelty supermarket.''</p>
        <p>It is a larger version of his original Abracadabra store, at 10 Christopher Street, which he started in 1981.</p>
        <p>Customers at the new store walk through black and gold wrought-iron gates to the main floor, where magic and hypnotism shows are performed on a stage three times daily. Overhead, a mezzanine decorated with angels and clouds circles around.</p>
        <p>The store aims to cater to all ranges of budget; vampire teeth (from $2.50 to $26) are age-old best-sellers, while a  stuffed grizzly bear in the window, at  $2,500, is the store's most expensive item,  Mr. Blum said.</p>
        <p>The store is organized by theme, varying from knights in shining armor to Indian chiefs arranged around a 12-foot totem pole. In the costume department on the lower level, Poison Ivy, the Batman character, battles for popularity with Xena, the warrior princess. Poison Ivy rents for $45 for five days, Xena for $135.</p>
        <p>Disco Balls Replace Windsors At the Very New El Morocco</p>
        <p>Club El Morocco, the supper club favored by the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and Grace Kelly in its 1940's heyday, has been reincarnated as Night Owls at Club El Morocco. The club opened on Sept. 19 at the site where the original club lasted until the 1980's: 1036 Second Avenue between 54th and 55th Streets.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere now is not so much dinner and dance as ''classic European discotheque,'' the general manager, Jack Cooke, said of the two-floor, 25,000-square-foot club, lined with mirrors and video screens.</p>
        <p>Whimsical Shop Pops Up Next to a Popover</p>
        <p>Next to the Popover Cafe on Amsterdam Avenue, a new store called Popover's Plums opened on Sept. 30 to sell ''joyful, familiar objects, both old and new,'' in the words of Carol Baer, its owner. The store, at 551 Amsterdam Avenue, at 87th Street, is named not for a purplish fruit but for ''something superior or desirable,'' Ms. Baer said.</p>
        <p>''I love to collect whimsical things, and the natural extension of what I like is here,'' said Ms. Baer, who opened her  restaurant 16 years ago. The objects range from a pencil grip ($1.79) to a Chrysler building pepper mill ($85). The nearby stables inspired a cowboy corner  that offers shortbread horseshoes. Baked goods from the cafe are also available.</p>
