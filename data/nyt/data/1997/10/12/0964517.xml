        <p>THE disco song ''Bad Girls'' boomed throughout the marble-floored duplex penthouse, which was a study in shocking pink: candelabras wreathed in magenta feather boas sat on pink-velvet-draped tables. On the balcony over Fifth Avenue, a row of brightly lighted mannequins looked like high-fashion gargoyles. A small army of caterers dressed like Las Vegas showgirls wore red dynel wigs.</p>
        <p>But the glitzy decorations paled in comparison to the guest list for the party given on Monday night by the songwriter Denise Rich and Helen Gurley Brown, the former Cosmopolitan editor, to celebrate Francesco Scavullo's latest photo album, ''Scavullo'' (Harry N.

        <p>THE disco song ''Bad Girls'' boomed throughout the marble-floored duplex penthouse, which was a study in shocking pink: candelabras wreathed in magenta feather boas sat on pink-velvet-draped tables. On the balcony over Fifth Avenue, a row of brightly lighted mannequins looked like high-fashion gargoyles. A small army of caterers dressed like Las Vegas showgirls wore red dynel wigs.</p>
        <p>But the glitzy decorations paled in comparison to the guest list for the party given on Monday night by the songwriter Denise Rich and Helen Gurley Brown, the former Cosmopolitan editor, to celebrate Francesco Scavullo's latest photo album, ''Scavullo'' (Harry N. Abrams), a collection of 50 years of glamorous celebrity shots -- from a juvenile Brooke Shields to Sting posed as Jesus.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rich's gargantuan apartment was filled with enough celebrities for another Scavullo book: Martha Stewart (photographed by Mr. Scavullo for Cosmopolitan when she was just 17); Gloria Vanderbilt; Geoffrey Holder and his wife, Carmen de Lavallade; Donald and Ivana Trump (attending separately); Geraldo Rivera; Kathy Sledge; Ahmet and Mica Ertegun; Earle Mack; RuPaul; Joel Grey, and Tommy Tune.</p>
        <p>Then there was the eye candy provided by the models Joel West and Marcus Schenkenberg, who has just come out with his own book, ''New Rules''; among other photos, it features a Cosmopolitan cover Mr. Scavullo shot of Mr. Schenkenberg paired with Cindy Crawford that never ran -- he was airbrushed out, and Ms. Crawford appeared solo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scavullo later pronounced his party, ''very 70's.''</p>
        <p>''Book parties in the 1990's can be so pretentious and uptight, with everybody air-kissing each other,'' he said. ''But this was wild, everybody dancing and drinking Champagne.''</p>
        <p>As Ashford and Simpson crooned ''Ain't No Mountain High Enough'' to Mr. Scavullo, Ms. Brown danced with RuPaul. ''That was my big thrill,'' she said. ''Why should this divine person dance by himself? I had tons of fun. I didn't know there still were parties like this in New York.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rich, Ms. Sledge and Deborah Cooper sang a rousing ''We Are Family.'' ''We were trying to create the whole 1970's Studio 54 environment,'' Ms. Rich said. ''That was really a Scavullo era. He's the icon.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scavullo may be an icon, but he also created one: the Cosmo girl, whose cleavage-plus-career image has been an enduring influence. ''Helen told me the cover had to be sexy, bosomy, lush and colorful,'' he said. ''At first I wasn't crazy about doing it. The truth is, I don't like anything that's vulgar. But the Cosmo girl is a Scavullo creation. She was always changing, but she never became Barbie.''</p>
        <p>How does Mr. Scavullo, 68, feel about being one of fashion photography's Old Masters? ''It's hard to believe it's been half a century,'' he said. ''It seems like it took 10 minutes. I feel like a kid.''</p>
        <p>THE NIGHT  Correction:  October 17, 1997, Friday</p>
        <p>A report in the Night column last Sunday about a party for the photographer Francesco Scavullo referred incorrectly to a photograph he took for Cosmopolitan magazine. His photograph of the models Cindy Crawford and Marcus Schenkenberg was never used; he later photographed Ms. Crawford alone, and that image appeared on the magazine's cover.</p>
