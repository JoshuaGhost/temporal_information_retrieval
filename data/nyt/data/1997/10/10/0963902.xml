        <p>''Yeltsin Opens Door He Once Closed to a 3d Term'' (news article, Oct. 3) suggests that Boris N. Yeltsin's decision not to rule out a third term as President of Russia ''did little to support his claim that he is building a state based on clear democratic principles.'' However, it may be that his position better reflects the growing pains of a fledgling democracy.</p>
        <p>Regardless of his intentions, the threat of another term is an invaluable political tool when facing a hostile legislative branch, as Mr. Yeltsin is now. By ruling out this possibility last month, Mr. Yeltsin committed a political blunder.</p>
        <p>Nathan Miller, in his biography of Theodore Roosevelt, describes how Roosevelt committed ''the greatest political blunder of his career'' on his 1904 election night by announcing, ''Under no circumstances will I be a candidate for or accept another nomination'' for President.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Miller, Roosevelt's statement ''made him a lame duck even before his new term had begun -- and would cause substantial trouble in the future.'' Roosevelt's wife would later say that had she known what her husband was going to do, she would have tried to prevent it. It is no wonder President Yeltsin's associates feel the same way.</p>
