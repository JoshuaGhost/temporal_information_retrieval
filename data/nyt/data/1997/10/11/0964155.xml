        <p>Traffic is sparse on Gov Thomas E Dewey Thruway day after crash forces partial closing of thruway (M)</p>

        <p>The only commuters along the partly closed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway who seemed really inconvenienced this morning were Bruce Bimbo and Christian Suarez.</p>
        <p>Bruce and Christian, both 14, live just east of the Thruway and go to school on the other side. Usually, they walk along the Central Park Avenue underpass. But the underpass, where a tanker truck blew up on Thursday, forcing the closing of 1.3 miles of the Thruway, was closed, too. So the boys had to cross the Thruway's detour lanes, where, contrary to every prediction, traffic was moving so swiftly and smoothly that it took them five minutes to get across the road.</p>

        <p>The only commuters along the partly closed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway who seemed really inconvenienced this morning were Bruce Bimbo and Christian Suarez.</p>
        <p>Bruce and Christian, both 14, live just east of the Thruway and go to school on the other side. Usually, they walk along the Central Park Avenue underpass. But the underpass, where a tanker truck blew up on Thursday, forcing the closing of 1.3 miles of the Thruway, was closed, too. So the boys had to cross the Thruway's detour lanes, where, contrary to every prediction, traffic was moving so swiftly and smoothly that it took them five minutes to get across the road.</p>
        <p>Throughout Westchester County, the day after what was billed as one of the most crippling highway closings in years turned into the Great Traffic Jam That Mostly Wasn't.</p>
        <p>Some commuters stayed home, preparing for Yom Kippur, or possibly getting a jump on the Columbus Day weekend. Some took trains: Metro-North's Harlem line carried nearly 30 percent more riders than it normally does on the Friday before a three-day weekend. Many used the five other north-south highways that run parallel to the Thruway. But just about everybody stayed off the Thruway itself.</p>
        <p>And the few drivers who ignored -- or outsmarted -- the dire warnings about the Thruway were treated to traffic that stopped for at most a minute as three lanes funneled into one at a forced exit onto an access road.</p>
        <p>''We didn't come this way yesterday because we heard about the mess,'' said Glen Gromel, 47, an ironworker from Valley Cottage who stopped at a Texaco station along the access road to watch a demolition crew begin to dismantle the scorched, sagging Thruway overpass. ''But today we figured it would be a good day to check it out.''</p>
        <p>Under different circumstances, Ray Albano, the owner of the Texaco station, would have been thrilled that Thruway traffic was forced to pass in front of his driveway. But there was so little traffic that Mr. Albano said his business was off by 80 percent. Three miles north, the Ardsley Travel Plaza was nearly deserted. Kathy Carroll, the assistant general manager, had to call 12 employees and ask them to stay home.</p>
        <p>Road conditions on the Thruway -- closed southbound from exit 4 to exit 3 and northbound from exit 5 to exit 6 -- are expected to remain the same until a temporary replacement bridge is completed in about 10 days, the State Thruway Authority said.</p>
        <p>Some drivers who avoided the Thruway this morning regretted it, like Mike Neuman of Mohegan Lake in northern Westchester County, whose car crawled off the Saw Mill River Parkway, more than two hours into a trip that usually takes 45 minutes. ''Usually, I take the Sprain down to work,'' he said, referring to the Sprain Brook Parkway, which runs just east of the Thruway. ''But yesterday that was jammed, so I thought I'd take the Saw Mill. But it was backed up all the way from Route 287. I think everybody had the same thought as me.''</p>
        <p>Transportation agencies said that, on the whole, traffic jams in Westchester were considerably fewer than normal during both the morning and evening rush hours. They warned, however, that Tuesday would be the real test.</p>
        <p>''Tuesday,'' said Maureen McCarthy, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Transportation, ''is going to be kind of the day of reckoning.''</p>
