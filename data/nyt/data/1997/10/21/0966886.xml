        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman turned the focus of her re-election campaign today to a problem that is not hers but could still cost her votes with cranky New Jersey commuters: a possible Amtrak strike the week before the election.</p>
        <p>As supporters of her Democratic opponent, James E. McGreevey, attacked her on urban issues, Mrs. Whitman appeared today largely in her role as Governor. And she was most strenuously working to reassure voters that she is doing all she can to avert a strike. The vision of voters stuck on the turnpike and wondering whom to blame seemed to inspire a brilliantly concise set of sentences from Mrs. Whitman, in which she simultaneously called on the President to avoid a strike, pushed the blame to the Federal level and praised her own accomplishments.</p>
        <p>''With more jobs coming into this state every day, with more people working, we cannot let this kind of a strike, this kind of national issue, tie up the progress that we were making here in New Jersey,'' she said at a news conference at the New Jersey State Police headquarters. ''We will be held hostage to a national crisis, and we need to insure that we do everything we can to get out of that position and minimize the impact.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mrs. Whitman said there was genuine concern in the administration both about a strike itself,  which would leave 65,000 commuters without their usual ride to work, and of its effect on an apparently narrowing election.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, the aides said, the timing -- a strike could start as early as Oct. 29 if mediators cannot come to agreement -- could hurt her on Nov. 4. On the other hand, the strike could work in her favor if she displays leadership in a crisis.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman has been working to lay the groundwork for a show of leadership. Today, she toured the  state police command center, where she and other state officials would monitor the effects of a strike on the roads. She said her transportation chief, John J. Haley Jr., would travel to Washington on Tuesday to meet again with Amtrak and labor negotiators to work on a deal that could allow New Jersey Transit trains to continue to run, despite a strike.</p>
        <p>But, she said, ''We have made great strides but it's not a done deal. We have to prepare for the worst.''</p>
        <p>Her contingency plan is a daily caravan of 500 buses, which would take commuters from as far away as Trenton to PATH stations that lead into New York City.</p>
        <p>Both candidates had fairly light public schedules today, a day before their second of three debates in Whippany on Tuesday night. The hourlong debate, which is to begin at 7 P.M., will be broadcast on WWOR-TV, Channel 9 in New York and Channel 57 in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>In Newark today, Mr. McGreevey picked up the endorsement of several dozen black leaders, including prominent clergy members, Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, Representative Donald M. Payne of Newark and several union leaders. After  Mr. Payne criticized Mrs. Whitman for not paying the minimum wage to welfare recipients who work -- she contends that they receive other benefits to make up the difference -- Mr. McGreevey called for a new agenda for the state's troubled cities.</p>
        <p>''We need a plan of action, a bold, vigorous plan, to invite, to bring back private capital to our cities, to literally rebuild our cities,'' he said. He did not offer many specifics but reeled off a series of broad initiatives, like commercial tax breaks and incentives for developing empty, inner-city lots that may contain toxic waste.</p>
        <p>Both candidates also talked in similar language about early-childhood education. Mr. McGreevey said he would establish all-day kindergarten and other day care programs that would combine health and education.</p>
        <p>In Trenton, Mrs. Whitman announced a five-year program for children under age 6 developed with the actor and film director Rob Reiner, who has turned early-childhood education into a personal crusade (backed up by $150,000 of his own money for the New Jersey initiative). The state has pledged $50 million in Federal block grant money, to be matched by school districts and supplemented by private money.</p>
        <p>Appearing with Mr. Reiner and a dozen or so squirmy 3-year-olds, Mrs. Whitman said her program was intended to set up centers around the state that would be financed in part with private money and would encompass day care and health care, as well as parenting and literacy programs for parents. The program began after she heard Mr. Reiner speak earlier this year at a conference of the nation's governors, and Mr. Reiner said he did not worry if people dismissed the program as aimed at her re-election.</p>
        <p>''Well, I'm a Democrat, and I'm a well-known Democrat,'' he said. ''And I'm here to say I will work with anyone in this country -- Republican, Democrat, independent, I don't care what -- to get the agenda of early childhood moved forward.''</p>
