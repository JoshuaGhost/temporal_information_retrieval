        <p>William Christie is as American and as patrician as Henry James, and he is almost single-handedly responsible for the revival of French Baroque music in the land of Louis XIV. But even he has had to take a back seat within the official state-supported structure that carries the Paris Opera, the Orchestra of Paris and other heavily subsidized pillars of the French musical establishment.</p>
        <p>''We are filling concert halls and we have created a new public for the Baroque movement, but we are not part of the official structure,'' Mr. Christie said during a break from a recent series of concerts by the Baroque ensemble he created 18 years ago, Les Arts Florissants, at the Cite de la Musique complex on the northeast edge of Paris.</p>

        <p>William Christie is as American and as patrician as Henry James, and he is almost single-handedly responsible for the revival of French Baroque music in the land of Louis XIV. But even he has had to take a back seat within the official state-supported structure that carries the Paris Opera, the Orchestra of Paris and other heavily subsidized pillars of the French musical establishment.</p>
        <p>''We are filling concert halls and we have created a new public for the Baroque movement, but we are not part of the official structure,'' Mr. Christie said during a break from a recent series of concerts by the Baroque ensemble he created 18 years ago, Les Arts Florissants, at the Cite de la Musique complex on the northeast edge of Paris.</p>
        <p>''Les Arts Florissants gets only 15 percent of its annual budget from the state, compared to 60 to 90 percent for the big traditional institutions,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In deficit-conscious France these days, money is increasingly scarce even for culture, but it is even scarcer for ensembles like Mr. Christie's.  This year it got only $500,000 of its $4.25 million budget from the French Ministry of Culture, and $160,000 each from the Regional Council of Lower Normandy and the city of Caen, which has become its best municipal friend. Pechiney, the big aluminum company, donates $467,000.</p>
        <p>All the rest has to come from the box office, but Les Arts Florissants has no trouble attracting audiences.</p>
        <p>The ensemble is virtually synonymous in France with performances of the music of composers like Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Jean-Baptiste Lully and Jean-Philippe Rameau, previously the province of academic  specialists who could rarely give full performances of the works.</p>
        <p>But for all the acclaim, Les Arts Florissants has had no permanent performing stage in Paris since it lost the perch it had at the Opera-Comique under Thierry Fouquet, when Pierre Medecin replaced him as artistic director three years ago.</p>
        <p>And it sometimes has to scrounge around for rehearsal space. A new production of ''Il Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda'' and other madrigals by Claudio Monteverdi, given its premiere recently at the Cite de la Musique, got its final touches in an underground auditorium in the cavernous Les Halles shopping complex.</p>
        <p>The duel between the crusader Tancred and Clorinda, a Saracen warrior queen he falls in love with but does not recognize in her suit of armor, had to be imagined, for this production did not have the lavish sets, costumes and mock horses that so enlivened the ensemble's highly acclaimed performances of Henry Purcell's ''King Arthur'' here two years ago.</p>
        <p>A co-production with the Covent Garden Opera in London, ''King Arthur'' was performed at the mainstream Chatelet Theater here two years ago and the Paris critics raved over it, in part because Mr. Christie brought out the French and Italian influences on this most English of composers.</p>
        <p>''At a cocktail party, once, a woman asked me what I did, and I said I was a harpsichord player,'' Mr. Christie recalled at the dress rehearsal of ''Tancredi e Clorinda.''  ''She looked at me and said: 'But that's impossible. You're American!' '' He laughed and added,  ''Some people here think America is all buffalo and cowboys.''</p>
        <p>He is himself a native Buffalonian, a word that amused an audience who came to the Cite de la Musique the other day to hear him -- along with the British critic and BBC program director, Nicholas Kenyon, and Marc-Andre Dalbavie, a modern French composer -- talk about the state of the Baroque revival.</p>
        <p>Classical music studies in Buffalo, where Mr. Christie learned organ and piano, were limited pretty much to the meat-and-potatoes 18th- and 19th-century repertories, he said. But at his 10th birthday party, in 1954, his grandmother gave him a recording of Francois Couperin's early-18th-century work ''Les Lecons de Tenebres.''</p>
        <p>''I said, 'I've never heard anything so beautiful,' '' he told the panel audience. ''Couperin provided my first encounter with the harpsichord, and as an adolescent I decided that this repertory of the Grand Siecle was what I was going to explore. This old music came as a novelty, a discovery of something fresh.''</p>
        <p>And because it was then so little performed, it seemed to offer him, as a performer, greater freedom than the standard repertory that had become so corseted by tradition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christie went on to study not music but art history at Harvard College, where he was a regular member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Organ Society and put on operatic productions at Adams House in the mid-1960's, moving after graduation to Yale to study harpsichord.</p>
        <p>But it was in France that he discovered his life's work.</p>
        <p>''I was fascinated with contemporary music and still have an open mind about it,'' he said, ''but to make Monteverdi, Rameau and the others come to life, I decided I needed to devote much more time to them.''</p>
        <p>Les Arts Florissants, named after a work by Charpentier that the group revived, was founded in 1979 to specialize in French, Italian and English works of the 17th and 18th centuries, performing them with a historically informed sensibility and enthusiasm that made them critical hits.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Christie, now 52, says himself, the polish and perfection are the result of incredibly hard work and long rehearsals on period instruments in which he is famously unsparing of individual performers' egoes. ''The things that appear the most simple are the things that require the most work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''He is demanding, and I think the performances show the results of that,'' said Shayne Doty, a harpsichordist who has worked with him.  ''Playing with the ensemble is invigorating on a level that surpasses anything I've known elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>For a long time, everything seemed to go Mr. Christie's way.</p>
        <p>''We had a few years when we lived very well,'' he told the audience at the Cite de la Musique. ''We had a good theater in Paris, a good director and we created a new public.'' But they didn't have that base in Paris, at the Opera Comique, anymore because its new director, Mr. Medecin, thought he had other things than Baroque to do in his hall.</p>
        <p>In 1995 Mr. Christie severed his own relationship with the Conservatory, where in 1982 he had become the first American professor ever (teaching early music), telling the newspaper Le Figaro that he resented the school's tendency to push his students into an academic ivory tower instead of out into the world of performances.</p>
        <p>''I like defending the underdog,'' he said. ''I like the sense of giving people new music, new composers, to discover.''</p>
        <p>As to whether ensembles like his really do perform the music the way the composers intended, that's a debate Mr. Christie says he is weary of.</p>
        <p>''How can I possibly tell you?'' he asks with exasperation. ''I don't have a telephone to call Monteverdi and ask.''</p>
