        <p>Livan Hernandez pitched in big games for the Cuban national team before defecting in 1995. He felt tremendous pressure to succeed.</p>
        <p>But there is a significant difference between pitching an important game for the homeland and pitching in the World Series, Hernandez, a 22-year-old Florida Marlins rookie, explained today. ''In Cuba,'' he said, ''you go to the baseball park on a bicycle in your uniform.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez will drive to Pro Player Stadium on Saturday to pitch Game 1 of the World Series. His uniform will be waiting for him, along with about 65,000 fans, an experienced and star-filled Cleveland Indians lineup, and the frenzied expectations of this community, which has embraced Hernandez since he signed as a free agent in January 1996.</p>
        <p>At first, he struggled to adapt to loneliness, the higher caliber of competition and a culture that offered such instant gratifications as the Big Mac. But Hernandez established himself in the major leagues this year, winning nine games and striking out 15 Atlanta Braves in Game 5 of the National League Championship Series on Oct. 12.</p>
        <p>Hernandez will be the youngest pitcher to start a World Series game since Dwight Gooden, who was 21 when he started Game 2 for the Mets in 1986, and the 10th rookie to start the first game of a World Series. The last rookie to start an opening game was Tim Belcher of the Dodgers in 1988.</p>
        <p>''I feel real good,'' Hernandez said today through a translator. Hernandez wore a dark baseball cap low on his forehead, but this did nothing to hide a brilliant smile at those moments when he chuckled as he gave his answers. ''I feel very strong physically.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez never saw a World Series game in Cuba, though family friends once lent him videotapes of the 1992 and 1993 Series. He heard from friends that the United States was a country of great opportunity where baseball players could make a lot of money.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 27, 1995, Hernandez defected when the Cuban national team was in Monterrey, Mexico. He called the agent Joe Cubas, who helped Hernandez escape the team's chaperons and establish residency in the Dominican Republic. Hernandez played winter ball for the benefit of dozens of major league scouts, and eventually Cubas paraded him and his fellow defector Osvaldo Fernandez around for big league teams to see, a form of show-and-tell: I show you two talented pitchers, and you tell how much money you are bidding.</p>
        <p>Wayne Huizenga, the Marlins' owner, sent his private plane to Texas to pick up Hernandez, who was working out for the Texas Rangers. In Cuba, you ride a bicycle to the ball park. In the United States, they send jets for you. After meeting with club officials, Hernandez was taken to the Little Havana section of Miami. He signed with the Marlins shortly thereafter for $4.5 million, including a $2.5 million signing bonus.</p>
        <p>There was, he acknowledges, tremendous culture shock, probably exacerbated by his fear that his family would suffer because of his defection. ''When people arrive in this country, they arrive blind,'' Hernandez said recently. ''They do not know what they are getting themselves into. They do not know what there is, what opportunities are out there, and would not know exactly what to do.''</p>
        <p>Tall and skinny when he defected, Hernandez immediately began adding weight, often eating at fast-food restaurants. His weight reportedly neared 250 pounds, about 30 pounds heavier than his listed weight. Hernandez was 2-4 with a 5.14 earned-run average for  Class AAA Charlotte before being demoted to Class AA, in Portland, Me.</p>
        <p>''Last year, I ate quite a bit at McDonald's,'' he said. ''Last year, I went by a Burger King and I had to stop. But now I am eating different foods.''</p>
        <p>He lost much of the weight he gained, pitched effectively in Class AAA at the start of the season and was promoted to the big leagues in June. Marlins first baseman Jeff Conine remembered seeing Hernandez throw for the first time and wondering how he could get hitters out; his fastball seemed so average. ''But then he threw one to me at first and almost broke my hand,'' Conine said. ''He has the kind of fastball that explodes.''</p>
        <p>Florida Manager Jim Leyland inserted Hernandez into the rotation in June, and he went on to win his first nine decisions. ''It took him some time to mature, which he certainly has,'' Leyland said. ''He's gotten himself into great shape. He's a very intelligent person. And I could see that adjustment -- he showed no fear. He's an anxious competitor.''</p>
        <p>Leyland intended to use Hernandez out of the bullpen throughout the post-season. But when Alex Fernandez was sidelined with a rotator-cuff injury after Game 2 of the N.L.C.S., Hernandez was inserted into the rotation and pitched one of the greatest games in playoff history against Atlanta, allowing only three hits and one walk while setting a single-game N.L.C.S. record for strikeouts. His mother, Miriam Carreras, was alerted in Cuba by friends that Hernandez was pitching, and she prayed for him. Hernandez later said, ''I know in Cuba everybody is following the Marlins, and everybody wants to wear a Marlins cap.''</p>
        <p>After the Marlins eliminated the Braves, Hernandez returned to his apartment in Little Havana shortly before dawn. On his doorstep, Marlins fans had left a pound cake, a bouquet of roses and a case of beer.</p>
        <p>Hernandez was asked what advice he would give to a player coming from Cuba. ''Work hard,'' Hernandez said, ''because this is the country of opportunity, like they say.''</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>Leyland Packs Them In</p>
        <p>MIAMI, Oct. 17 (By The New York Times) -- Now that he has finally reached the World Series, Marlins Manager Jim Leyland has invited a number of friends to stay with him during the games here. ''My wife rented eight beds today that were delivered at noon to my house,'' Leyland said today. ''To be honest, I don't know who is staying at my house, but it's going to be like a dormitory.''</p>
