        <p>REMEMBER Arsenio, Chevy, Dennis? All gone. But not Space Ghost. No, Space Ghost, now starting his fourth season, has succeeded in capturing a segment of the late-night talk show market that even Jay and Dave can't hope to reach: viewers aged 8 to 11 whose parents let them stay up till 11 on Friday nights. (Also teen-agers and a chunk of the demographically significant trend-setters in the 18-to-25 category, who obviously don't watch the 11 o'clock news.)</p>
        <p>Never mind that Space Ghost's show, ''Space Ghost From Coast to Coast,'' doesn't compete directly with Jay and Dave, who come on at 11:30 in New York, 15 minutes after Space Ghost goes off. Or that Space Ghost is a cartoon character. Come to think of it, that's undoubtedly a big part of the draw in the age of ''The Simpsons.''</p>

(Also teen-agers and a chunk of the demographically significant trend-setters in the 18-to-25 category, who obviously don't watch the 11 o'clock news.)</p>
        <p>Never mind that Space Ghost's show, ''Space Ghost From Coast to Coast,'' doesn't compete directly with Jay and Dave, who come on at 11:30 in New York, 15 minutes after Space Ghost goes off. Or that Space Ghost is a cartoon character. Come to think of it, that's undoubtedly a big part of the draw in the age of ''The Simpsons.''</p>
        <p>The people in about half a million households apparently think so, because they watch this loopy 15-minute show to see a 31-year-old superhero with an ageless physique and the self-awareness of Ted Baxter trade insults with his sidekicks, the irritable Zorak and the less irritable Moltar, and conduct off-the-mark interviews with real celebrities from Mark Hamill to Fran Drescher to Ice-T.</p>
        <p>Isabel Gonzalez, who books the human guests from her Cartoon Network office in Atlanta, says the interview questions are derived from a guest's bio sheet and as well as from the intergalactic sensibilities of a superhero who depends on writers for most of his ideas.</p>
        <p>Thus, a standard query like ''So, what's your latest film?'' might be followed by ''If you were reincarnated as an amusement ride, which ride would you be?'' or ''How's your oxygen level?'' Space Ghost's handlers seem genuinely fond of this selfless do-gooder who likes beef logs and first turned up on television in 1966. In those days, he was righteous; now he tends toward the petulantly egotistical.</p>
        <p>''He's got crimes to solve during the days,'' said Andy Merrill, 30, a former daytime Space Ghost fan and now a staff writer who tends to indulge his boss's excesses. ''And then he's a host at night. When he's not catching villains, he works only 15 minutes a week. He has nothing to do with the show except showing up and sitting in the chair. That's why we don't have a monologue.''</p>
        <p>The product of a brainstorming session a few years ago on how to do something for almost nothing, ''Space Ghost From Coast to Coast'' is the old footage edited into the new scenes of the celebrity guests. In a way, this crusader's second shot at popularity is directly attributable to his early fans.</p>
        <p>''Space Ghost was my favorite action cartoon when I was a child,'' said Michael Lazzo, the 39-year-old producer and a senior vice president at the Cartoon Network. ''I think people find the show, or give it a chance, because they've never seen anything like it. It's a post-modern, ironic take on what you would expect from a talk show. Our assumption is that things are different in outer space.''</p>
        <p>The guest spots, usually two for each of a season's 24 episodes, have become popular around the entertainment industry. ''When we first started doing the show, nobody knew what we were up to,'' Mr. Lazzo said. ''They looked like deer caught in the headlights.''</p>
        <p>A guest is usually videotaped at the Turner Broadcasting studio nearest him. The questioning is conducted by phone, often by one of the show's writers or by the voice of Space Ghost, George Lowe. Then the video portion is matched with the animated program, with the guest appearing to be beamed up on a monitor to the right of Space Ghost's desk.</p>
        <p>For the guests, ''it's an alternative venue to promote their talents,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. ''It's like when I was a kid and would watch the Muppets, and I would see, say, Alice Cooper on the show. He wasn't promoting a record. He was just there. That I think is so cool.''</p>
