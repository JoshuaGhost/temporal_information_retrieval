        <p>Dr Susan Kiss Sarnoff letter responds to October 19 article by Rosalie Osias on decision by Pepsi president Brenda Barns to quit to spend more time with her children</p>

        <p>Poor Rosalie Osias. She is yet another woman who just doesn't get it. Her article, ''A Disastrous Loss for Feminists,'' [Opinion, Oct. 19] laments that Brenda Barnes, president of Pepsi-Cola, quit her job to spend more time with her children. In fact, Ms. Osias sees only two means of women having it all: science enabling men to give birth, and women learning ''to be as driven in their careers as men.''</p>
        <p>These may be Ms. Osias's goals for women, but they have never been feminist goals. Instead, feminism has always been about offering women choices. Having it all in a feminist context is exactly what Brenda Barnes has achieved: having succeeded in the corporate board room, she chose to leave it to conduct other work which may be less lucrative, but which clearly offers her more current rewards than did her position at Pepsi-Cola.</p>

        <p>Poor Rosalie Osias. She is yet another woman who just doesn't get it. Her article, ''A Disastrous Loss for Feminists,'' [Opinion, Oct. 19] laments that Brenda Barnes, president of Pepsi-Cola, quit her job to spend more time with her children. In fact, Ms. Osias sees only two means of women having it all: science enabling men to give birth, and women learning ''to be as driven in their careers as men.''</p>
        <p>These may be Ms. Osias's goals for women, but they have never been feminist goals. Instead, feminism has always been about offering women choices. Having it all in a feminist context is exactly what Brenda Barnes has achieved: having succeeded in the corporate board room, she chose to leave it to conduct other work which may be less lucrative, but which clearly offers her more current rewards than did her position at Pepsi-Cola.</p>
        <p>Ms. Osias is apparently confused by the current split in feminism, which is not really a split at all. It is, instead, an attempted ''coup'' of feminism by the likes of Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, who, like Ms. Osias, would mold all women to their vision of what women should be.</p>
        <p>Ms. Osias is a particular target of these pseudo-feminists who oppose her use of sex to sell her legal services. These pseudo-feminists view sex exclusively as one of the forms of ''violence'' by which ''all men subjugate all women.'' It is particularly ironic that a major target of the anti-sex pseudo-feminists should reach the same false conclusion as her accusers: that feminists must conform to a particular life style dictated by their so-called ''leaders'' to be real feminists.</p>
        <p>Thank goodness that most women ignore the ideologues who would dictate any single definition of feminisim, realizing that being true to themselves is more important than whether they fit any current definitions of behavior imposed by others (including that of ''feminist'').</p>
        <p>These are the women who are expanding the choices for all women. If feminism is successful, or, more to the point, if women are successful, their success will be measured by the degree to which the workplace has to conform to their needs, not the other way around. And I suspect that any institution that can simultaneously conform to Brenda Barnes, Rosalie Osias, Catherine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin offers hope for all women.</p>
