        <p>TAD SCHARFENBERG, Democratic candidate for Suffolk County District Attorney, called a news conference this month to outline his 10-point plan to change the prosecutor's office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scharfenberg detailed his plan and attacked the incumbent, James M.

        <p>TAD SCHARFENBERG, Democratic candidate for Suffolk County District Attorney, called a news conference this month to outline his 10-point plan to change the prosecutor's office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scharfenberg detailed his plan and attacked the incumbent, James M. Catterson Jr., a Republican, as an out-of-control bully so fearsome that would-be contributors to Mr. Scharfenberg's campaign had been scared off. ''He is the most despised elected official in county history because of his abuses of power,'' Mr. Scharfenberg said.</p>
        <p>Two reporters, and no cameras, were on hand. Little news resulted.</p>
        <p>As a lackluster campaign season winds up, candidates for Long Island offices, including Nassau County Executive and the District Attorneys in Suffolk and Nassau, are again resigned to paying for advertising on television and radio and in print for a yawning public in an off-year election.</p>
        <p>Once again candidates who spend the most are making their impression, while those with limited resources struggle to avoid virtual anonymity or the ignominy of having their image cast in negative advertising.</p>
        <p>In the top Nassau race County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, a Republican, has been expecting to raise more than $3 million in his campaign for a third term. The Democratic challenger, Supervisor Lewis J. Yevoli of Oyster Bay, said he hoped to raise $225,000.</p>
        <p>By the end of last month Mr. Gulotta had spent more than $700,000 on television advertising. The frequency of his ads has picked up as the election nears. ''For every one I have,'' Mr. Yevoli said, ''he will have 30.''</p>
        <p>In one ad on cable television in Nassau and on broadcast television in New York City, Mr. Gulotta speaks about his record as a tax cutter. ''Working together,'' he says, ''we've cut and frozen general county property taxes for five years in a row. This year we are cutting taxes again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yevoli pointed out that the ad did not mention questions raised this month by State Comptroller H. Carl McCall about $100 million in revenues in Mr. Gulotta's proposed $2 billion budget for next year. The projection, which enabled Mr. Gulotta to propose a small property-tax cut for 1998, includes $16 million for the county's anticipated share from a yet-to-be approved nationwide settlement in the tobacco case.</p>
        <p>The ad also does not mention that in 1991, in a period of fiscal crisis, Mr. Gulotta proposed a 25 percent property-tax increase for 1992.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yevoli said an attack on Mr. Gulotta's budgetary tomfoolery was a cornerstone of his campaign. He said the county had a current budget deficit of up to $50 million that would grow larger next year under Mr. Gulotta's proposal.</p>
        <p>He also said Mr. Gulotta should be blamed for an increase in county debt from $1.1 billion to $2.5 billion during his years in office. ''There is nothing that has happened in that 10-year period that can justify a more than doubling of county debt, nothing,'' said Mr. Yevoli. But he said that without additional advertising it was ''difficult to get people to focus on something like the Nassau County budget and county debt when they are struggling to survive and have mortgages to pay.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yevoli said he was swamped by Mr. Gulotta's advertising. ''No matter when you turn the television on,'' he said, ''there's a Gulotta commercial. You can't go down a street in Nassau without seeing a Gulotta sign. Every Nassau County bus has a Gulotta sign on it, every rail trestle. It's like Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>''It's not exactly a level playing field. It's gotten to the point where you have to say, 'Hey, come on, that's not what it's all about.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta's campaign said Mr. Yevoli was complaining because he was being outmatched by a better candidate. ''The real reason Tom Gulotta's opponent is having a tough time running for county executive is that Tom Gulotta is a widely popular county executive who has cut taxes, cut crime and created jobs,'' said the campaign director, Michael E. Marr.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta is also the candidate of one of the most powerful Republican organizations in the country, and is running in a county where Republicans hold a 3-to-2 enrollment advantage among registered voters.</p>
        <p>One ad was doing more than giving Mr. Yevoli the name and face recognition that he had gained by shaking an estimated 40,000 hands at railroad stations, shopping centers and local events. Entitled ''Cheesy'' by Mr. Gulotta's campaign, the ad depicts Mr. Yevoli as a tax raiser and big spender of tax money for questionable purposes and his own enrichment.</p>
        <p>''Lew Yevoli knows exactly what to do with your money,'' the narrator says. ''Spend it.''</p>
        <p>The ad says Mr. Yevoli ''voted to spend $175,000 on a cheese museum,'' voted 66 times to raise his own pay, voted 25 times to raise taxes and ''even voted for the largest tax increase in New York history.''</p>
        <p>The presentation features a photograph of Mr. Yevoli that makes him appear ratty and disreputable. ''Cheese museums, big pay raises, huge tax increase, that's Lew Yevoli,'' the narrator ends.</p>
        <p>The ad offers no time frame and does not make clear that Mr. Yevoli cast his vote for a cheese museum in Rome, upstate, in 1988, when Mr. Yevoli was an assemblyman. The museum was a so-called member item that Assembly members routinely approve.</p>
        <p>Nearly all the votes that the ad refers to were made when Mr. Yevoli was in the Assembly. The votes he was said to have cast for tax increases and higher salaries could not be confirmed.</p>
        <p>Another Gulotta ad based on ''Jeopardy'' warns, ''Lew Yevoli puts Nassau's taxpayers in jeopardy,'' and shows a photograph of Mr. Yevoli.</p>
        <p>Experts in political advertising say negative ads use rivals' photos to create unpleasant associations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yevoli's more limited ad campaign began in the summer with a scattering of ads on cable television on the Island and on broadcast stations in New York City. It focused on the disparity between financing for the two campaigns.</p>
        <p>''Don't let Tom Gulotta and the G.O.P. bosses buy this election,'' it said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yevoli said last week that Mr. Gulotta's campaign had been enriched by contributions from ''anyone who has done work for the county,'' including consultants and contractors, adding, ''There is also not a county commissioner who has not made a contribution.''</p>
        <p>''The man has $3 million to spend on the election,'' Mr. Yevoli said. ''It's obscene. What it says is that you can't even consider running for the highest office in this county unless you have a million bucks to spend.''</p>
        <p>The executive director of Common Cause in New York State, Rachel Leon, said such disparities between incumbents and challengers were typical. ''It's all too familiar,'' Ms. Leon said. ''It's what we are seeing at the state and national level, this incredible incumbent advantage. It is really unfortunate that it comes down to how much money you have.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Leon said the need for large sums to challenge incumbents meant that challengers faced ''an uphill battle unless they are bought out by special interests or are independently wealthy.''</p>
        <p>In Suffolk, Mr. Scharfenberg started a negative campaign last week that urged voters to ''end the Catterson reign of terror.''</p>
        <p>''I'm putting all my money into radio and TV,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But with hopes of raising a total of $50,000 for his campaign, Mr. Scharfenberg has little to spend.</p>
        <p>Mr. Catterson, a widely recognized figure, is running with all the advantages that a Republican incumbent enjoys in a heavily Republican county.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk Republican Committee, which is financing the campaign, expects to spend more than $300,000 on the effort, according to a spokesman, Alan F. Eysen. ''The party has always strongly supported him,'' Mr. Eysen said. ''We would be foolish not to give all our support to the person at the top of the ticket.''</p>
        <p>In the absence of stiff competition, Mr. Catterson's ads have ignored the challenger's allegations of abuse and concentrated on portraying Mr. Catterson as a proven crime fighter.</p>
        <p>''District Attorney James Catterson,'' says a 30-second ad that shows a close-up of Mr. Catterson on the job. ''Tough. Honest. Doing the job of fighting drugs and keeping criminals behind bars.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scharfenberg's ad paints a different picture. ''First he said that he would not prosecute every man who belts his wife across the face,'' says the ad, showing an unflattering photo of Mr. Catterson and referring to a comment that he made in his campaign four years ago.</p>
        <p>The ad also says Mr. Catterson ''threatened to haul county officials in front of a grand jury if they didn't end the car-lease scandal investigation.'' That refers in part to allegations by four former and current county officials that Mr. Catterson had threatened them with subpoenas. Mr. Catterson has denied those contentions.</p>
        <p>The ad suggests that the District Attorney should investigate Mr. Catterson. ''The problem is he is the district attorney,'' it continues, showing another unflattering photo of Mr. Catterson.</p>
        <p>The ad cuts to a photo of Mr. Scharfenberg and ends: ''End the Catterson reign of terror by electing Tad Scharfenberg Suffolk D.A.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scharfenberg's campaign began running a radio ad last week with virtually the same text. ''These ads are hard hitting and they are the truth,'' he said. ''And with Catterson the truth is enough.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutor's race in Nassau has been mild by comparison, in fact nearly invisible. The Democratic challenger, Jon S. Kaiman, a defense lawyer, said he planned no radio or television ads.</p>
        <p>''It's a low-finance campaign,'' Mr. Kaiman said. ''Basically it's a grass-roots effort. We're going door to door and to train stations. It's not a year when people are particularly interested in politics. The economy is good. Crime is down. People are not angry.''</p>
        <p>The incumbent, Denis Dillon, a Republican, plans to spend $25,000 on radio and television ads. The ads depict a highly professional prosecutor whose office has one of the highest conviction rates in the country. There is no reference to Mr. Kaiman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dillon is seeking a seventh term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaiman, who said he would raise far less than $25,000, added that he appreciated the restraint that Mr. Dillon had shown in his spending on  advertising. ''At least,'' Mr. Kaiman said, ''to his credit he is not going to spend a million to try to shape some image just for the sake of it.''</p>
