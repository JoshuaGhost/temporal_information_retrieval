        <p>A pigeon-fearing Manhattan woman whose efforts at pest control landed her in jail for several hours settled her $4 million lawsuit against the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and one of its officers yesterday for an undisclosed amount.</p>
        <p>The A.S.P.C.A. officer arrested the woman, Renee Solomon, 66, a professor of social work at Columbia University, in 1992 on charges of cruelty to animals, saying that a coat of pigeon repellent on the ledge outside her window was trapping and killing smaller birds. The Manhattan District Attorney dismissed the charges for lack of evidence and Dr. Solomon filed her lawsuit that same year.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, she also settled, for $50,000, a portion of the suit involving two former neighbors, Leonard and Elly Epstein, who Dr. Solomon said had pushed the A.S.P.C.A. to arrest her. The settlements came at the start of the second week of testimony in a civil trial in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''I feel so relieved and pleased,'' Dr. Solomon said yesterday. She said the settlement would help pay psychiatric and legal bills she incurred as a result of the events and would serve notice that organizations and officers with the power to arrest individuals should not abuse it.</p>
        <p>But in settling the case, the A.S.P.C.A. did not admit any wrongdoing. Jamie Cotel-Altman, general counsel for the organization, said it agreed to pay Dr. Solomon because it did not want to use any more resources to fight the case and wanted to get ''back to our other work on behalf of animals in need.''</p>
        <p>The Epsteins also did not confess to the pattern of harassment laid out in Dr. Solomon's suit. Their lawyer, Toni A. Bean, said that while the couple reported Dr. Solomon to the A.S.P.C.A., they did not engineer her arrest. The amount of their settlement was released because, unlike the A.S.P.C.A.'s portion of the suit, the agreement with the Epsteins did not include a nondisclosure clause.</p>
        <p>According to Dr. Solomon's testimony and the lawsuit, a bird feeder that the Epsteins put on their terrace at 315 East 86th Street turned the area outside her bedroom window into a boisterous pigeon meeting place. The ruckus of beating wings roused her as early as 5 A.M., and the revelers left messy calling cards. Ms. Bean said that Dr. Solomon had exaggerated the events and stressed that the Epsteins never intended their feeder to be a pigeon magnet.</p>
