        <p>INTERNATIONAL 3-16</p>
        <p>China's Plan to Privatize May Cause Worker Unrest  China plans to shift almost all its 300,000 state enterprises to private ownership.

        <p>Brazil May Be Deaf to Pope</p>
        <p>Brazilians are said to look to the Roman Catholic Church for moral guidance, only to ignore it. That attitude challenges the Pope, who is preaching traditional family values there.</p>

        <p>Many May Face Hurdles  In Seeking Health Policies Some health insurance companies appear to be finding ways to avoid making coverage more readily available to millions of Americans who change or lose their jobs, state officials say. Some insurers are discouraging sales to people with pre-existing conditions or charging such customers very high premiums.</p>
