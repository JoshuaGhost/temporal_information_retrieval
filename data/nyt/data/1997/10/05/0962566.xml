        <p>DINING aboard ship is becoming more inventive these days as vessels offer passengers a choice of restaurants, a variety of cuisines, and different kiosks, counters and corners for wine tasting, caviar sampling, coffee comparison and bites of pizza, pastry and ice cream.</p>
        <p>When the Disney Magic enters service in March, her 2,400 passengers will be able to dine in a different spot each night of their three-  or four-night cruise, including an adults-only restaurant. The 101,000-ton megaship Carnival Dynasty, launched last November, offers 24-hour room service to her 2,600 passengers in addition to two formal dining rooms and a poolside restaurant. The 77,700-ton Mercury, being christened by Celebrity Cruises in New York on Oct. 27, will have a Champagne and caviar bar seating 96 in leather club chairs in the three-story aft atrium.</p>

        <p>DINING aboard ship is becoming more inventive these days as vessels offer passengers a choice of restaurants, a variety of cuisines, and different kiosks, counters and corners for wine tasting, caviar sampling, coffee comparison and bites of pizza, pastry and ice cream.</p>
        <p>When the Disney Magic enters service in March, her 2,400 passengers will be able to dine in a different spot each night of their three-  or four-night cruise, including an adults-only restaurant. The 101,000-ton megaship Carnival Dynasty, launched last November, offers 24-hour room service to her 2,600 passengers in addition to two formal dining rooms and a poolside restaurant. The 77,700-ton Mercury, being christened by Celebrity Cruises in New York on Oct. 27, will have a Champagne and caviar bar seating 96 in leather club chairs in the three-story aft atrium.</p>
        <p>Among other innovations on such newer ships as Royal Caribbean International's Grandeur of the Seas and the Dawn Princess of Princess Cruises are in-cabin television sets with VCR's, refrigerators with minibars, wall safes, walk-in closets and ship-to-shore telephone service via satellite. More expensive cabins on the Mercury come with bathtubs fitted with whirlpool jets, separate showers, fax machines and private butler service.</p>
        <p>Another budding trend is the entirely smoke-free ship. Carnival will introduce the smoke-free policy on the Paradise, which is scheduled to arrive late next year. In contrast, Celebrity is offering cigar smokers their own club on the new Mercury, as it does on its Century and Galaxy.</p>
        <p>While megaships -- those of more than 100,000 tons -- are seen as the trend of the future, small and medium-size ships are still being built. Arriving in December is the 320-passenger Paul Gauguin of Radisson Seven Seas Cruises, which will have two restaurants with open seating, a fitness center and a watersports platform.</p>
        <p>The former Dolphin, Premier and Seawind companies have merged into one line, Premier Cruises; its five-ship fleet is undergoing a $22 million refurbishment. New to Premier is the Rembrandt (formerly the Rotterdam), which is scheduled to be replaced by Holland America this month with a new flagship, the Rotterdam VI. First European Cruises will enter the American market in January with three refurbished ships, and the former Royal Viking Star will return to American waters this month as the Black Watch of Fred Olsen Lines from her new home port of Dover.</p>
        <p>This directory mainly covers cruises from Nov. 1 to Feb. 28. Dates, ports of call and fares are subject to change. Unless otherwise noted, fares are for one person in double occupancy, excluding port taxes. Surcharges generally apply to the Christmas-New Year's holiday period. More information is available from travel agents or the cruise lines. Addresses and phone numbers appear on page 26.</p>

        <p>Freighter travel: joining the cargo cult</p>
        <p>There are still slow boats to China, and soon there should be four more.</p>
        <p>The German shipping company Deutsche Seereederei Rostock is negotiating for a trading license to expand service on its trans-Pacific freighters to more of China than Hong Kong from Long Beach, Calif. Currently, the 45,000-ton container ships Pacific Senator, Patmos Senator, DSR Atlantic and Palermo Senator spend about 42 days going to Yokohama and Kobe in Japan, Pusan in South Korea and Hong Kong, after calling at Oakland, Calif., and Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>When the new service is approved, they will add Dalian, Tianjin and Quingdao to their route and exclude Hong Kong. In the new Chinese ports, the layovers are expected to run 24 to 36 hours.</p>
        <p>Each vessel carries a maximum of four passengers under 80 years of age in two cabins with unobstructed views, an extra-wide single bed, a second berth that folds down from the wall, a sofa, a table, an upholstered chair, a desk, a minirefrigerator and a television with VCR. Other on-board amenities include a sauna and a gym with rowing machine, stationary bicycle and table tennis and an outdoor pool.</p>
        <p>The vessel's configuration allows passengers to walk around the entire ship on the main deck. The fare is $4,410 a person, double occupancy. The company is represented in the United States by Freighter World Cruises of Pasadena, Calif.</p>
        <p>While most freighters carry no more than 12 passengers, an exception is the 88-passenger Americana of Ivaran Line, which has a health club, slot machines and blackjack tables and a bar with a pianist.</p>
        <p>Freighter passengers need flexibility in their schedules, since loading and unloading freight governs departures and arrivals and can create delays.</p>
        <p>Here is a selected list of companies and travel clubs offering freighter cruises:</p>
        <p>Blue Star Pace c/o Travltips, Post Office Box 580188, Flushing, N.Y. 11358; (718) 939-2400 or (800) 872-8584.</p>
        <p>Compagnie Polynesienne de Transport Maritime, 2028 El Camino Real South, Suite B, San Mateo, Calif. 94403; (415) 574-2575 or (800) 972-7268 (offering service to Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands).</p>
        <p>Curnow Shipping, c/o Golden Bear Travel, 16 Digital Drive, Novato, Calif. 94949; (415) 382-8900 or (800) 551-1000.</p>
        <p>Freighter World Cruises, 180 South Lake Avenue, Suite 335, Pasadena, Calif. 91101; (818) 449-3106 or (800) 531-7774.</p>
        <p>Freighter Travel Club of America, 3524 Harts Lake Road, Roy, Wash. 98580; (360) 458-4178.</p>
        <p>Ivaran Line, 111 Pavonia Avenue, Fifth Floor, Jersey City, N.J. 07310; (201) 798-5656 or (800) 451-1639.</p>
        <p>Polish Ocean Lines, c/o Gdynia America Line, 1001 Durham Avenue, South Plainfield, N.J. 07080; (908) 412-6000, extension 107 (offering service from Europe to South America, Africa and the Mediterranean).</p>
        <p>Trips that turn rivers into grand boulevards</p>
        <p>Plentiful food, associated with ocean-going cruising, also applies to river journeys. Beyond that, the differences are considerable, and even within the realm of river cruising, there is a wide variety of vessels, waterways, scenery, seasons and activities.</p>
        <p>Hotel barges, which ply the smaller rivers and canals of European countries, are operated primarily in spring, summer and fall. Outside Europe, there are river cruises year-round in the United States, Egypt and China, among countries with popular programs.</p>
        <p>One of the latest developments in the United States is the establishment of River Barge Excursion Lines, which is building its first vessel in Louisiana and expects to begin sailing on the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Memphis on July 4. Service is also planned on the Ohio, Missouri and Cumberland Rivers, the Atchafalaya Basin and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway from New Orleans to Port Isabel, Tex., and Matamoros, Mexico.</p>
        <p>The big difference between the new company and others is that River Barge Excursions will offer hotel barge cruises in the European tradition, as distinct from paddle wheelers and river cruisers. Its first vessel, the River Explorer, will carry 200 passengers on trips ranging from three to nine nights at fares starting at $750 a person, double occupancy. The vessel will consist of two, three-deck, 297-foot barges with 100 outside cabins of 200 square feet each. Cabins will have satellite television service, VCR's, phones with computer ports, twin or queen-size beds and bathrooms with tubs.</p>
        <p>There will also be a dining room, a two-deck show lounge and several other lounges, one of which will be a re-creation of a pilot house providing a scenic bow view. A 3,000-horsepower towboat will push the vessel.</p>
        <p>Another program, on the 163-passenger, 4-deck sternwheeler Queen of the West, which began operating two years ago, follows part of the route of Lewis and Clark on the Willamette, Columbia and Snake Rivers from Portland, Ore., to Lewiston, Idaho. Fares for seven-night round trips are $1,045 to $3,295 a person, double occupancy, and include a jet-boat ride in Hells Canyon, visits to the Maryhill Museum of Art in Washington and Multnomah Falls in Oregon and tours of a winery, the Pendleton Woolen Mills and Fort Clatsop in Oregon.</p>
        <p>Columbia River cruises are also offered by Alaska Sightseeing Cruise West on the 80-passenger Spirit of Columbia. The company's Spirit of Discovery, carrying 84 passengers, sails from San Francisco to Sacramento on three-  and four-night cruises on the Sacramento River.</p>
        <p>The best-known river cruises in the United States, however, are those of the Delta Queen Steamboat Company on the Mississippi, Ohio, Cumberland and Arkansas Rivers aboard its three paddle wheelers. The 1926 Delta Queen, a registered national historic landmark, carries 174 passengers. The 1976 all-steel reproduction Mississippi Queen can handle 414 passengers. The company's newest, the American Queen of 1995, has a capacity of 436 passengers. Both of the newer paddle wheelers have outdoor pools.</p>
