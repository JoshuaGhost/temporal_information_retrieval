        <p>As a participant in the California AIDS Ride 4 this year, I would say to the doubters, Go along on the ride and then judge. It took six months to train, but the experience was more than worth it. I will always remember that week of ''perfect community.'' If Pallotta makes money on it, so be it. We were well taken care of and lacked only sleep. The welcome we received in the towns will always be with us.</p>
