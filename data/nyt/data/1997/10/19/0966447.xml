        <p>The presidential election campaign here has erupted in a national debate over the outlawed Irish Republican Army and its political wing, Sinn Fein.</p>
        <p>Most people here in the Irish Republic fear and abhor the I.R.A. --  which long waged a guerrilla war to end British rule in Northern Ireland -- and are skeptical about Sinn Fein's commitment to an end of the sectarian violence. The I.R.A. has declared a cease-fire, but the ultimate goal of both organizations remains a united Ireland free of British control, and this is a major issue at the peace talks now under way in Belfast.</p>
        <p>Until this week, the presidential campaign had been maundering along with five candidates contending for the largely ceremonial post in the Oct. 30 election, all professing their dedication to the motherland.</p>
        <p>The four women candidates seemed to be imitating the style of Mary Robinson, who left the job after a seven-year term to become United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights..</p>
        <p>Some even sounded like they were using the high-minded phrases of Ms. Robinson, a former Senator and accomplished civil rights lawyer. Only one of the candidates, Mary McAleese, who is leading in opinion polls, is a college graduate, a law professor at Queens University in Belfast. The Irish Constitution permits any citizen of the island of Ireland -- North or the Republic -- to run.</p>
        <p>The one man, Derek Nally, 61, a retired police sergeant who is running as an independent, wore dark suits and white shirts but sparked no fire in what most people felt was a soporific campaign.</p>
        <p>Then he found the issue that has brought the campaign to life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nally charged, in effect, that Ms. McAleese, 45, was a closet supporter of the I.R.A. and Sinn Fein.</p>
        <p>This is a volatile charge in the Irish Republic, where Sinn Fein receives only 2 percent of the national vote. Mr. Nally's charge was based on a memorandum written by Dymphna Hayes, a Foreign Affairs Department official who had spoken to Ms. McAleese last summer. It said that Ms. McAleese seemed sympathetic to Sinn Fein, approving of its election gains in Northern Ireland, even before the I.R.A. restored its cease-fire on July 20.</p>
        <p>The cease-fire cleared the way for Sinn Fein to enter the broad-based peace talks in Belfast -- the first time since Ireland was partitioned 75 years ago that the largely Roman Catholic Sinn Fein has sat at a negotiating table with Protestant unionist leaders, discussing the future of the predominantly Protestant British province of Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nally questioned whether Ms. McAleese was ''a proper person'' to be President.</p>
        <p>''Like me,'' he said in a statement this week, ''most Irish people would never vote for Sinn Fein, peace process or no peace process, because they have been carrying on a murder campaign for 25 years. Mary McAleese seems to work on a different set of moral assumptions.''</p>
        <p>She responded by saying of the I.R.A., ''I've no time for them in any shape or form.''</p>
        <p>But she did not deny outright her attitude toward Sinn Fein as represented in the Hayes memo. In recent days she has emphasized that while she is a devout Catholic and that her family, which had run a pub in Belfast, had been forced to move south to the Irish Republic by attacks by Protestant paramilitaries, she noted that in Northern Ireland, where she grew up and now lives again, many of her closest friends are Protestants, members of parties that want the North to remain British.</p>
