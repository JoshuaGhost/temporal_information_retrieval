        <p>Stung by the recent loss of $590,000 in jewelry to thieves at Newark International Airport, the wife of Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston took a jab at the Port Authority police yesterday, suggesting that they could learn something from Houston's police force.</p>
        <p>''The police?'' Elyse Lanier said in a telephone interview from Houston when asked about law enforcement efforts at Newark Airport by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

        <p>Stung by the recent loss of $590,000 in jewelry to thieves at Newark International Airport, the wife of Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston took a jab at the Port Authority police yesterday, suggesting that they could learn something from Houston's police force.</p>
        <p>''The police?'' Elyse Lanier said in a telephone interview from Houston when asked about law enforcement efforts at Newark Airport by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. ''They'd do good to call our Police Department and take some lessons. We're very focused on bringing down crime here.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Lanier, taking the phone, said he was ''not making any comparisons'' of crime rates or law enforcement in Houston and at Newark Airport. But he said he had written a critique for the airport authorities after his wife was ''bumped and distracted'' by thieves who made off with her bag. He refused to elaborate, saying that investigators had urged him not to talk about it.</p>
        <p>Asked about Mrs. Lanier's implied criticisms, Terry Benczik, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority, expressed regret over the theft, which occurred two and a half weeks ago at a security checkpoint at Continental Airlines in Terminal C and has been reported in Houston's news media. She noted that Port Authority investigators were still working on the case.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Benczik also said that thefts at Newark Airport, and at Terminal C in particular, were extremely rare. While 12.4 million passengers have used the terminal this year, she said, there have been only 300 reported thefts -- one for every 41,333 people.</p>
        <p>Moreover, she said, overall crime at Newark Airport, used by 30 million people a year, is down more than 20 percent this year from last.</p>
        <p>By contrast -- though comparisons of an airport and a city may be apples and oranges -- the city of Houston had an increase of 2.8 percent in overall crime last year, with 135,329 felonies reported, compared with 131,602 in 1995, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's latest figures, released in June. In the nation, F.B.I. statistics show, serious crime declined 3 percent in 1996 from 1995 -- the fifth successive annual decrease.</p>
        <p>The theft that led to yesterday's long-distance dissonance occurred on Oct. 7 as Mayor and Mrs. Lanier were heading home from a brief visit to New York City, where Mr. Lanier received an award at a black-tie dinner from an organization of municipal bond dealers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanier, immensely popular in Houston, has been Mayor for six years but is barred by term limits from running for re-election this year. The leading mayoral candidate is Lee P. Brown, Houston's Police Chief from 1982 to 1990, who served as New York City Police Commissioner and as President Clinton's drug policy adviser, and returned to Houston in 1995 to teach at Rice University.</p>
        <p>In New York, the Laniers had stayed at the Hotel Pierre, and Mrs. Lanier had brought 10 items of personal jewelry, which law enforcement officials said were worth $590,000.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lanier declined to say yesterday what the items were, or whether the jewelry was insured. But she recalled the theft at a Continental checkpoint where carry-on luggage and passengers pass through metal detectors.</p>
        <p>''I placed my bag on the conveyor belt,'' she said. ''Somebody bumped up against me. And it was gone.''</p>
        <p>A police report elaborated slightly, saying that two men and a woman had apparently been involved. One of the men distracted Mrs. Lanier with words, and the other man and the woman bumped her, then pointed to an airline ticket folder on the floor. Mrs. Lanier stooped to pick it up and examined it, and when she looked for her bag on the conveyor belt, it was gone. So were the thieves.</p>
        <p>''It is very disappointing when something like this happens,'' Mrs. Lanier said. ''I'm most grateful that we weren't hurt. You'd think things like this don't happen. But it happened right at the security belt.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanier, a 72-year-old former real estate developer who made his mark as Mayor by rebuilding roads, neighborhoods and parks, and by adding hundreds of officers to Houston's police force -- all without raising taxes -- said he did not witness the theft.</p>
        <p>''I had gone on ahead,'' he said. ''She was with Dave Walden, my executive assistant.''</p>
        <p>The Mayor said that the technique used by the thieves who took his wife's jewelry was ''part of a nationwide practice'' and ''used at different airports'' across the country. Law enforcement officials confirmed that many of those who commit such crimes typically move from airport to airport.</p>
        <p>Ms. Benczik noted that airline personnel, and not the Port Authority police, are in charge of inspecting luggage and passengers at airport  security checkpoints, but she acknowledged that the police were responsible for patrolling the airport, for overall security and for protecting passengers from criminals.</p>
        <p>''We want this crime to be solved,'' Ms. Benczik said. ''We're extremely concerned when any passenger is victimized. We want passengers to feel safe and use the airports freely, and not be concerned about their belongings. But when you have 30 million people using the facility every year, some things may happen.''</p>
