        <p>Survey conducted by Elrick &amp; Lavidge shows majority of respondents, 66 percent, say they would do nothing if Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,800 points or more in one day, equivalent of 23 percent drop on Oct 19, 1987; 14 percent say they would add to their investments, presumably immeidately after bid decline on theory that they could find some bargains; 56 percent say that future market correction is not major concern because theyare long-term investors; while only 25 percent can foresee the Dow dropping as much as much as it did 10 years ago over next 12 months, 39 percent do not expect that to happen in next five years (L)</p>

        <p>The best way to weather market breaks is to build a long-term diversified portfolio and sit tight.</p>
        <p>That has been the conventional advice to investors and it seems that more than a few have heeded it, from the findings of a study sponsored by American Century Investments, the mutual fund company in Kansas City, Mo., on the eve of the the 10th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash today.</p>
        <p>The survey, conducted by Elrick &amp; Lavidge, a national market research firm, explored whether another crash would alter investment behavior. Five hundred telephone interviews were conducted between Aug. 24 and Sept. 4 among people who owned stock mutual funds or individual stocks and did not work in the financial services industry.</p>
        <p>A majority of respondents, 66 percent, said they would do nothing if the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1,800 points or more in one day, the equivalent of the 23 percent drop on Oct. 19, 1987; that share of respondents is virtually the same that sat tight 10 years ago. However, 14 percent said they would add to their investments, presumably immediately after a big decline on the theory that they could find some bargains.</p>
        <p>A majority, 56 percent, said that a future market correction was not a major concern because they are long-term investors. And while only 25 percent could foresee the Dow  dropping as much as it did 10 years ago over the next 12 months, 39 percent did expect that to happen in the next five years.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding their concern about a coming market break, very few respondents have adjusted their portfolios during the last year to prepare for a correction. Only 23 percent of the participants have moved money among investments in their taxable accounts to better withstand a stock-market correction, and only 20 percent of respondents with company-sponsored retirement plans have moved investments in those  plans. In both cases, the most common reason was to diversify their portfolios.</p>
        <p>While the respondents' outlook was not exactly bleak, it was also not as wildly enthusiastic as the expectations voiced in a national survey reported earlier this month that was conducted for Montgomery Asset Management, a fund company in San Francisco. In that study, in which 750 fund shareholders were questioned, the respondents said they anticipated average annual returns of 34 percent on their fund investments over the next 10 years -- or roughly three times the average annual return from stocks over the last 60 years.</p>
        <p>A 3.8% Increase In Industry Pay</p>
        <p>Many Americans are reaping big returns from their fund investments this year, and people in the fund industry continue to be generally well-compensated for helping achieve those returns.</p>
        <p>The annual percentage increases in total compensation (salary plus  bonus) were, to be sure, small this year: 3.8 percent over all and just 1 percent for chief executives. But chief executives still had an average total compensation of $1,026,900, according to an annual study conducted  by Buck Consultants, a human resources firm in New York, which surveyed the compensation levels in effect on April 1 this year.</p>
        <p>''With mutual fund companies coming off back-to-back strong years, bonuses paid to C.E.O.'s this year mirrored what they received last year,'' said Paul Gavejian, a principal and compensation consultant in Buck's office in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>Some people in the industry, however, received much larger increases. Heads of fixed-income investing, for example, received a 25.4 percent increase in total compensation, to an average of $652,900, and the average compensation for chief administrative officers jumped 23 percent, to $225,700.</p>
        <p>And some fund executives saw their compensation decline sharply.  Total compensation for taxable-bond chiefs fell 37 percent, to an average of $540,200. Heads of tax-exempt securities investments earned $375,900, on average, a decline of 15.5 percent.</p>
        <p>The survey, based on responses from 51 fund companies, looked at total compensation levels for more than 100 positions, as well as at compensation practices and policies.</p>
        <p>New Funds</p>
        <p>Compass Capital International Small Cap Equity will use a value approach to picking stocks with market capitalizations of $100 million to $1 billion in developed and emerging markets. The maximum initial sales charge is 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Kemper High Yield Opportunity aims for high total return through current income and capital appreciation by owning junk bonds. It will be run by Michael McNamara and Harry Resis, co-managers of Kemper High Yield, and Dan Doyle, a Kemper analyst. Unlike Kemper High Yield, the new fund can invest in instruments not commonly found in high-yield funds; specifically, it can invest up to 20 percent of its assets in equities and 25 percent in emerging-market debt securities. The maximum initial sales charge is 4.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Twentieth Century Emerging Markets aims for capital growth by investing mainly in stocks of small and large companies in Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia. The minimum investment  is $10,000; subsequent minimum investments are generally $50.</p>
        <p>In Brief</p>
        <p>Shareholders approved a proposal by Vontobel U.S. Value to become a nondiversified fund, which will allow it to concentrate its portfolio in fewer positions.</p>
