        <p>The New York manager of a company that exports textiles from India was found dead in his Times Square office shortly after noon yesterday, the police said.</p>
        <p>A maintenance worker discovered the body in the offices of All India Handloom Fabrics Inc. The man had been stabbed numerous times in the neck and back, said a police spokesman, Officer Gary Cillo.</p>
        <p>An attorney for the company, M. Thomas Kuriakose, identified the man as Prabhakaran Pisharats. Company records identified him as both Kannambra P. Prabhakaran and K. P. Perry. Mr. Kuriakose said the dead man, who had been a friend for nearly 20 years, had changed his name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuriakose said last night he did not know why his friend had been killed. ''He has no enemies,'' Mr. Kuriakose said. ''It was maybe a robbery or burglary or something.''</p>
        <p>But, he said, there were rarely large amounts of cash in the office. Based in New Delhi, the company is a cooperative owned by the Indian Government that exports hand-woven fabrics, including silks and cottons, to fashion houses in New York, Mr. Kuriakose said. The office generally contained textile samples.</p>
        <p>The police said they did not know when the killing had taken place or how long the body had been inside the 19th-floor office at 1440 Broadway, at 41st Street. They said they had no suspects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuriakose said his friend lived in New Jersey with his wife and a son; he is listed in the Edison, N.J., telephone directory. Mr. Pisharats had another son, Mr. Kuriakose said, who was studying medicine in India.</p>
