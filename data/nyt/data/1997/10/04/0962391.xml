        <p>When Nestle USA announced this week that it was pulling from shelves a product called ''Nestle Magic'' in the face of complaints that it was dangerous for children, a coalition of food safety advocates and their lobbyists claimed victory.</p>
        <p>But the biggest winner was M&amp;M/ Mars, a competing candy giant that had quietly agreed to subsidize much of the lobbying campaign against Nestle. Mars had argued that the product, a toy-candy combination, violated the Food and Drug Safety Act of 1938 and the entire candy industry would suffer if any child was hurt by Nestle Magic.</p>
        <p>But it appears that Mars began its efforts against Nestle just after it tried and failed to bring a product to market that was similar in some ways to Nestle Magic.</p>
        <p>Officials who were involved directly in the aborted efforts to market a toy-candy combination said that Mars had been hoping to sell an item called Treasure X, which consisted of a box that contained both a chocolate bar and a hard toy.</p>
        <p>Mars sells a similar product in Australia and New Zealand called Lucky Dip.</p>
        <p>Company officials today said that there were crucial differences between those products and Nestle Magic. But Attorney General Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who campaigned against the Nestle product, said the Mars product raised many of the same concerns as did Nestle Magic.</p>
        <p>Nestle Magic consisted of a two-inch hollow chocolate ball covering a plastic shell inside of which was a small plastic Disney character. Both Mars and Nestle unleashed a horde of lobbyists and lawyers on Congress and regulatory agencies in the battle over the product.</p>
        <p>Lobbyists paid by Mars argued that Nestle Magic violated a 60-year-old law prohibiting the selling of candy with toys imbedded inside. Moreover, the lobbyists insisted that combining a toy and a candy in a box was reckless because it made children likely to put the toy in their mouths.</p>
        <p>Nestle withdrew its product this week, citing questions about the product's safety and legality. Nestle officials said they had received about a dozen safety complaints about the product but none were serious.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Blumenthal said that in an incident on Aug. 29, a 3-year-old Texas boy swallowed one of the toys in the shape of the Simba character from ''The Lion King,'' and it became lodged in his throat. ''The mother tried to dislodge it by placing the child over her knee and hitting the child on the back several times,'' Mr. Blumenthal said. ''As that failed, the child turned blue and purple in the face.'' He said that after the Heimlich maneuver was used, the toy came flying out covered with blood.</p>
        <p>Jim Conlan, the external affairs director for Mars, said that Treasure X was markedly different from Nestle Magic in that the toy would not have been imbedded in the candy and thus would not have violated the law.</p>
        <p>''Treasure X was a completely different kind of product,'' he asserted.</p>
        <p>He said Mars decided against selling the product because of a variety of marketing decisions. But one person involved in the Treasure X project who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mars abandoned the item after problems in getting it to market before Nestle Magic. Another person said the goal of Mars officials with its Treasure X product was the same as Nestle's goal for Nestle Magic -- to replicate in America the great success toy-candy combinations have had in Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal, the Connecticut Attorney General, said Treasure X would have presented some of the same problems as did Nestle Magic.</p>
        <p>''By packaging the toy and candy in the same box it would encourage children to put the hard plastic item in their mouths, inviting choking,'' he said. ''It would have been an accident waiting to happen.''</p>
