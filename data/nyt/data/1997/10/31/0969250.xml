        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The shortage of sign language interpreters affects not only students (news article, Oct. 30) but also businesses that want to accommodate deaf employees, government agencies that need to make their services accessible to deaf people, and others who want to see deaf people participate in their activities and use their products and services.</p>
        <p>There is no short-term solution. It takes years to become a qualified sign language interpreter. But there is a long-term solution: Offer American Sign Language in the public schools as a ''foreign'' language. That would spark interest in the language and create a pool of people fluent in sign language.</p>
