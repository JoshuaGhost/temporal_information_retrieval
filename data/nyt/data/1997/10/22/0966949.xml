        <p>MAYBE there will always be plenty of fish in the sea.</p>
        <p>Even as the country's beloved cod and flounder, bluefin tuna and native swordfish have become scarce, tons of fresh, mild-tasting white-fleshed fish from far-flung seas are softening the pain of the dwindling supplies.</p>
        <p>Wild sea bass from Chile, yellowtail and greentail snapper from South America, red mullet or ''rouget'' from North Africa have turned airports into fish ports. And they may turn the hard times of American fisheries into a boon for food lovers in this country, while giving local fish stocks at least a chance to recover.</p>
        <p>Today the best-priced and highest-quality fish around are more likely to hail from Icelandic waters or the Indian Ocean than from Cape May or Cape Cod. And many of the immigrant species are richer, more interesting fish. The flake -- the overlapping layers of flesh in the fillet -- tends to be larger in these fish, making them harder to overcook, and therefore capable of reaching gastronomic heights unmatched by the more delicate domestic varieties of white fish.</p>
        <p>Ports from Chile to Thailand are now equipped with modern processing plants and staffed by experienced low-cost laborers. The fish are packed in customized foam-plastic containers and rushed to airports, reaching New York almost as quickly as from Cape Cod or Florida and usually less expensively. When they arrive at the Fulton Fish Market, the whole yellowtail and greentail snappers are glistening and quivering in their white insulated boxes. The eyes of the rouget -- even after so long a journey -- are clear and unclouded, and the startling fresh char smells like cucumber. This is perfect, pristine fish, the cream of the imported crop.</p>
        <p>Last year, $6.7 billion worth of edible fish was imported, compared with the $3.6 billion of fish harvested in waters off the United States.</p>
        <p>''Our fish imports are almost double what they were 20 years ago,'' said Dr. James Anderson, a professor of natural resource economics at the University of Rhode Island and the publisher of Seafood Market Analyst/ Seafood Report, a monthly newsletter in Narragansett, R.I.</p>
        <p>''The Atlantic ground fish are scarce, with the exception of the Alaskan canning fisheries,'' he said. ''The Pacific coast is in trouble and, thanks to the craze for blackened redfish, the Gulf fisheries are extinct as a commercial enterprise, though they are coming back as a recreational fishing area.</p>
        <p>''We tend to import fresh, high-value seafood and export processed fish, lesser-quality fish, as well as good fish like mackerel, herring and fish roe that America has never developed a taste for.''</p>
        <p>In addition to formerly unfamiliar species, fish markets across the country are offering tuna and mahi-mahi from Ecuador, a glut of farm-raised shrimp from Mexico and Thailand, swordfish from Brazil and the Azores, cod from Iceland and farmed salmon from the Bay of Fundy in Canada.</p>
        <p>David Samuels, the third-generation owner of Blue Ribbon Fish, a wholesale business at the Fulton Fish Market, said his grandfather would be shocked at the way he buys fish. Instead of dealing with individual boat captains, Mr. Samuels works the fax and telephone lines, worries about the price of international air freight and would be out of business without a reliable customs broker and shipper.</p>
        <p>But his grandfather would be even more startled, Mr. Samuels said, at his prices. ''I'm selling this gorgeous Atlantic salmon from Canada for the same price he sold domestic salmon 50 years ago,'' he said. ''If I had to rely on domestic sources for salmon, tuna or sword, I'd be out of business.''</p>
        <p>If he were dependent on domestic sources for shrimp, salmon and tuna, he added, ''the prices could triple.''</p>
        <p>Tuna taken in North American waters can fetch as much as $15 a pound, according to Steven Cohen, manager of the fish department at Balducci's in Manhattan, while tuna imported from Chile can bring as little as $5.</p>
        <p>Mr. Samuels understands that the new global fish business offers opportunities for unscrupulousness among distant suppliers. He said there is ''plenty of old scrubby fish around, fish that was improperly handled at sea or packed, fish that missed its airline connection, old, inferior fish.'' Mr. Samuels puts his trust in his own eyes and a handshake. Instead of driving to local ports, as his grandfather did, he flies to Brazil and Chile, to Iceland, China and Thailand.</p>
        <p>The best wholesale importers deliver exquisite white-fleshed fish like Chilean sea bass and Arctic char that are mild-mannered and infinitely adaptable, fish that seem custom made for American taste -- they can slide nearly unnoticed into traditional recipes. The change from a local to an international fishery poses no trauma for cooks or diners.</p>
        <p>At the same time there are some welcome culinary challenges. The imported fish tend to be richer than domestic white fish and have a larger and more forgiving flake; such character is irresistible to chefs, because it lets them invent more complex recipes for fish that can endure long, slow cooking. The rich, large-flaked fish allowed Eric Ripert to create a dish of Arctic char with fava beans and peas, for instance, delighting his customers at Le Bernardin in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>But even with all the raves about foreign fish, a few Americans aren't buying.</p>
        <p>Mike Foley, the third-generation owner of M. F. Foley in New Bedford, Mass., is one of the rare East Coast fish purveyors who have remained unwaveringly faithful to fish caught off New England -- what there is of it. (The harvest from New England's fisheries has dropped to 641 million pounds in 1996 from 780 million in 1980, but the most telling loss is among favored fish like cod: the catch fell to 31 million pounds from 118 million in the same period.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Foley acknowledged that imported fish, because it is so plentiful, can be less expensive, but he said the foreign is not always top quality. For instance, he said, swordfish from Chile and tuna from Ecuador are harvested during their spawning season, and are therefore mushier and inferior. Recent reports of contaminated fish from South America also concern him.</p>
        <p>But most fishmongers -- and American seafood aficionados -- are too grateful for a steady supply of relatively inexpensive fish to quibble over character and nuance.</p>
        <p>''I love red snapper from the gulf more than anything in the world,'' said Mr. Cohen of Balducci's. ''But there isn't any real snapper left in the gulf, so I'm learning to love the yellowtail snapper from South America. It's not red snapper, but it's good fish.''</p>
        <p>Such concessions may have already led to some recovery in the native fish stocks off North America. After years of concern over the depletion of the oceans, some environmental scientists believe -- perhaps hope is a better word -- that the lessons of the past have been learned. They even see new evidence that American fisheries are on the way back.</p>
        <p>Preliminary statistics recently published by the National Marine Fisheries Service show the first hint that the free fall in Atlantic fishing stocks is stabilizing, according to Dr. Steven Murawski, the chief biologist at the Northeast Fisheries Center in Woods Hole, Mass.</p>
        <p>''There's been a modest upturn,'' he said. ''But there are still far too many vessels that are far too efficient for harvesting the stocks that will be available soon.''</p>
        <p>Marion Kaiser, the president of Aquanor Marketing in Boston, which imports fish from Iceland and Norway, said that stringent regulations in those countries have brought ''a stunning recovery to their fisheries.''</p>
        <p>Congress is currently considering a one-year moratorium along some parts of the Atlantic coast on the use of super-trawlers, which are more than 350 feet long and can net as much as 250 metric tons of fish in a day.</p>
        <p>But like many seafood lovers, Dr. Murawski said that a complete comeback of the native fisheries depends on a shift in public taste. Spiny dogfish, also called sand shark (the fish of fish and chips in England), is cheap, delicious and abundant, he said. So are mackerel, herring and whiting.</p>
        <p>But the American taste in fish grew out of generations of eating only mild-tasting, white-fleshed varieties, so changing public taste is really a matter of changing habits. And habits die hard.</p>
        <p>The Cautionary Tale of the Roughy</p>
        <p>AS the fishing industry searches the world for new fish, it is one thing to hope for a better environmental result this time and another to really believe in one. The history of the fishing industry gives one reason to pause.</p>
        <p>''We need the imports to take the stress off the local fisheries,'' said Jasper White, the executive chef of Legal Seafoods in Boston. ''But every solution to the fish riddle has a down side. The imports hurt the local fisherman and also run the risk of extinguishing entire species in other parts of the world. Look what happened to orange roughy.''</p>
        <p>In 1979, when domestic flounder was becoming more difficult to find, a treasure trove of roughy was discovered near the Challenger Plateau off New Zealand. Roughy, a firm, white-fleshed fish that can weigh as much as 20 pounds, is almost interchangeable with large flounder in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Before roughy started being filleted and frozen at sea and groomed for the American market, the fish was known as slimhead. Repackaged as orange roughy at about $2 a pound frozen or $8 a pound fresh, it became the American fish of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>So quickly was roughy sucked out of the sea that as much as 80 percent of the population was wiped out before scientists realized that the fish, which lives up to 100 years, takes more than a quarter of a century to reach sexual maturity.</p>
        <p>New Zealand took immediate action and strictly limited how much roughy could be caught. Scientists say that they now believe that the population has been restored to 60 percent of what it was before the boom, and that they expect it to be completely restored in a few years. New Zealand's fisheries are now considered among the best managed in the world.</p>
        <p>''The right fish and the right marketing campaign can create a voracious appetite in America,'' said Marion Kaiser, the president of Aquanor Marketing in Boston, which imports farmed salmon, Arctic char and Icelandic cod. ''We don't have to work to sell high-quality imported fish to Americans,'' she said. ''We have to work to buy and sell responsibly.''</p>
        <p>ROUGET ESCABECHE</p>
        <p>Adapted from ''Fish and Shellfish'' (James Peterson, Morrow, 1996)  Total time: 15 minutes, plus marination</p>
        <p>6 8-ounce fillets of rouget (red mullet)</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>
        <p>1/2  cup flour</p>
        <p>7  tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>1  red onion, thinly sliced</p>
        <p>2  cloves garlic, peeled</p>
        <p>2/3  cup sherry vinegar</p>
        <p>2  bay leaves</p>
        <p>1/2  teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</p>
        <p>2  tablespoons chopped parsley</p>
        <p>6  baby artichokes, trimmed and quartered</p>
        <p>1  fennel bulb, sliced</p>
        <p>1/2  cup green olives, pitted.</p>
        <p>1. Season the fish fillets with salt and pepper, and dust lightly with flour. Warm two tablespoons of the olive oil in a large skillet and saute 3 fillets over high heat 2 minutes on each side. Carefully remove the fish, transfer to a nonreactive dish and pat dry. Repeat with the 3 remaining fillets.</p>
        <p>2. Wipe out the saute pan, add 1 more tablespoon olive oil and cook the red onion and garlic over medium-low heat about 7 minutes. Add the vinegar, bay leaves and thyme and simmer 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the parsley and cook 1 minute. Pour this mixture over the fish and marinate in the refrigerator at least 2 hours and up to 3 days.</p>
        <p>3. Before serving, steam artichokes until soft, about 10 minutes. Put 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium saute pan and cook sliced fennel over medium-low heat until soft, about 7 minutes. Toss artichokes and fennel with the olives and serve alongside the marinated fish.</p>

        <p>ARCTIC CHAR WITH FAVA BEANS AND PEAS</p>
        <p>Adapted from Le Bernardin  Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons butter, thinly sliced, plus an additional tablespoon for greasing skillets</p>
        <p>4 7-ounce fresh Arctic char fillets</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste</p>
        <p>3/4  cup shelled small peas</p>
        <p>24  shelled fava beans, skinned</p>
        <p>12  snow peas, cut across into thin strips</p>
        <p>4  teaspoons cooked and julienned bacon</p>
        <p>4  scallions, the first inch of white only, quartered lengthwise</p>
        <p>1/2  cup shredded iceberg lettuce</p>
        <p>2  cups fish stock</p>
        <p>4  small sprigs fresh mint, plus 8 leaves chopped.</p>
        <p>1. Butter 2 12- to 14-inch skillets and set aside. Cut away the thin white belly section from the char fillets and season on both sides with salt and white pepper. Place 2 fillets in the middle of each skillet and surround with the peas, fava beans, snow peas, bacon, scallions and lettuce. Season the vegetables with salt and white pepper. (The fish can be prepared to this point several hours ahead.)</p>
        <p>2. Pour the fish stock into the skillets and place each one on a burner turned to high heat. Bring the stock to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-high. Cook 5 to 7 minutes, basting frequently.</p>
        <p>3. Carefully place 4 fillets on plates. Surround each with a quarter of the vegetables.</p>
        <p>4. Sprinkle the chopped mint over the vegetables and lay a mint sprig on each fillet. Serve immediately.</p>

        <p>1 pound medium-size shrimp, peeled</p>
        <p>1/2  cup fish broth, clam juice or water</p>
        <p>1 red bell pepper, diced</p>
        <p>1 green pepper, diced.</p>
        <p>1. In a food processor, pulse the tomatoes, onion, cilantro, garlic, chili, lime juice, oil, salt and pepper until smooth. Marinate the fish and shrimp in this mixture for an hour.</p>
        <p>2. Place the marinated fish in a heavy pot over medium heat. Add the fish broth and a cup of the marinade. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 30 minutes. Remove fish from liquid and cool. Add the shrimp and peppers and simmer over low heat 10 minutes. Meanwhile, when the fish is cool enough to handle, remove the skin and chunk into bite-size pieces. Return to pot, add salt and pepper and serve over rice.</p>
