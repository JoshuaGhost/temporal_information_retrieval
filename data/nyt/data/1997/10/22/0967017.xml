        <p>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party disclosed a widely anticipated package of proposals to jump-start Japan's moribund economy today, but economists and investors declared them short on substance and long on political expediency.</p>
        <p>The package, much of which had leaked out over the last two weeks, included measures to deregulate the sale and development of real estate, cut corporate income taxes, allow long-distance companies to set rates more freely, and increase Government assistance to small and midsized businesses.

        <p>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party disclosed a widely anticipated package of proposals to jump-start Japan's moribund economy today, but economists and investors declared them short on substance and long on political expediency.</p>
        <p>The package, much of which had leaked out over the last two weeks, included measures to deregulate the sale and development of real estate, cut corporate income taxes, allow long-distance companies to set rates more freely, and increase Government assistance to small and midsized businesses. The Japanese Cabinet will decide next month whether to formally adopt the proposals.</p>
        <p>In its statement, the party referred to the package as ''emergency national economic measures'' and said, ''In order to break the current economic stagnation, it is necessary to wipe out public worry and the cloud over the future of the economy.''</p>
        <p>But the plans lacked the stimulant measures that many economists had hoped for. They contained no specific numeric targets, with many of the proposals carrying the qualifier that the Government would ''make an effort'' to achieve them.</p>
        <p>There was no mention of an income tax cut, which many economists believe is key to increasing domestic demand.</p>
        <p>''Nobody knows the exact impact of the proposals because they made no concrete suggestions,'' said Masaru Takagi, chief economist at the Fuji Research Institute Corporation.  ''For instance, they say they will cut corporate taxes, but the key point is how much and over how many years, and they don't tell you that.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Takagi and others now estimate that output in the fiscal year that ends on March 31 will be flat. The Government has not yet reduced its projection for 1.9 percent growth, although Koji Omi, director general of the Economic Planning Agency, conceded today that meeting that target would be difficult -- particularly after the economy shrank in the spring at an 11.2 percent annual rate.</p>
        <p>Much of the disappointment with today's proposals centered on the decision not to cut income taxes. The Government has taken several bites out of the Japanese consumer's wallet this year, raising the consumption tax to 5 percent in April from 3 percent, taking back a previous income tax reduction and increasing to 20 percent from 10 percent the portion of medical bills that the consumer must pay.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to see how some of these measures announced today will support increased demand,'' said Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia. ''There's nothing that says X amount of money will be spent or returned to taxpayers.''</p>
        <p>The Economic Planning Agency today released the quarterly consumer-sentiment index, a test of consumers' willingness to make purchases in the next six months, and it rose 1.2 points, to 41.2, in the quarter ending last month. Nonetheless, Yasuhiro Asami, director of the business statistics research unit, said the planning agency ''is not entirely optimistic'' about consumer confidence.</p>
        <p>The Government has all but ruled out an income tax cut any time soon, with the Finance Ministry refusing to consider issuing new bonds to make up for the loss of revenue that an income tax cut -- or any tax cut, for that matter -- would entail.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said today that there was an urgent need to restore confidence in the wobbly Japanese stock market. He attributed the market's weakness to scandals involving Japan's largest brokerage firms and urged a quick resolution to investigations.</p>
        <p>But analysts explain the recent weakness in part by noting expectations that the ruling party's economic package would lack punch. The main stock market dropped 84.42 points today, to close at 17,210.09, and fell 229 points last week.</p>
        <p>The yen, however, gained against the dollar today, aided by American trade figures for August, which showed an unexpected widening in the United States deficit.</p>
