        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your Oct. 15 Arts pages article on Syracuse University's new Center for the Study of Popular Television:</p>
        <p>Mark Crispin Miller, identified as a ''leading media scholar,'' is quoted as saying, ''In the Renaissance, you'd have a hard time finding a play that's even readable other than Shakespeare's plays.''</p>
        <p>Excuse me?</p>
        <p>Great dramatists were never thicker on the ground than in London in Shakespeare's time. People still read Christopher Marlowe, Ben Jonson and John Webster, and their plays are regularly produced in London, along with those of their lesser known contemporaries Francis Beaumont, John Fletcher, Thomas Middleton and Cyril Tourneur.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare's lifetime was a great era for drama in Spain and China, too -- Lope de Vega and Tang Xianzu are two playwrights whose works have been consistently produced and appreciated throughout the past 400 years.</p>
        <p>I agree with Mr. Miller about the worthlessness of most television dramas and comedies, but given his ignorance of theater history, I wonder what programs he used as a basis of comparison in forming his opinion.</p>
