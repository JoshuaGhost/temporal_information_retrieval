        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Senate patent bill that you characterize as both ''mischievous'' and ''bad'' (editorial, Oct. 17) is neither. You say the bill's requirement for publication of patent applications before the patent's issuance would allow ''corporations with the financial muscle'' to ''maneuver around'' the patent ''even if it is later issued.'' You also say the bill would encourage corporations to ''hide secrets.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Senate patent bill that you characterize as both ''mischievous'' and ''bad'' (editorial, Oct. 17) is neither. You say the bill's requirement for publication of patent applications before the patent's issuance would allow ''corporations with the financial muscle'' to ''maneuver around'' the patent ''even if it is later issued.'' You also say the bill would encourage corporations to ''hide secrets.''</p>
        <p>But inventors have long been required to claim their invention in detail. This fairly provides large corporations as well as individuals with the right to choose either to avoid the patent (design around it) or to pay royalties. Also, the bill encourages corporations to commercialize products by providing an infringement defense only to those who commercialize the invention before the patent application's filing. Thus, the bill not only encourages commercialization but also the prompt filing of applications.</p>
        <p>You legitimately raise the concern of ''small inventors'' that ''premature publication'' gives away their secret if the application fails. True, but this would be a dilemma for every patent applicant: Do I file an application to gain the exclusive rights offered by the law (and disclose my invention regardless of whether I get a patent), or should I keep the invention secret?</p>
        <p>ROBERT C. SCHEINFELD  New York, Oct. 20, 1997</p>
        <p>The writer is a patent lawyer.</p>
