        <p>Before the game's fateful play today, Miami Dolphins linebacker Anthony Harris screamed at his teammates in the defensive huddle.</p>
        <p>''Show me what you're made of,'' Harris implored over and over as the Kansas City Chiefs, on the Dolphins' 38-yard line, faced a fourth down and 3 while trailing by 3 points with 1 minute 45 seconds to go.</p>
        <p>Harris, a second-year pro from Auburn, knew he would be isolated on Marcus Allen, the veteran Chiefs back who is a superb receiver and a likely target for a short pass.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac threw a quick pass to Allen in the flat. There were only two problems: the pass was a little behind Allen, who bobbled it, and Harris was making a mad rush toward him. Harris slammed Allen down 2 yards short of a first down, preserving the Dolphins' 17-14 victory before 71,794 fans at Pro Player Stadium.</p>
        <p>''I saw his red eyes coming right at Allen,'' Miami linebacker Derrick Rodgers said. ''It's almost like you could hear him grunting with each step.''</p>
        <p>The victory elevated Miami to 3-2, while dropping Kansas City to 4-2 and ending the Chiefs' four-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>''With that Godfather type of voice of his, it's hard to tell exactly what he's saying,'' Dolphins defensive end Trace Armstrong said of Harris. ''It's like a silent dog whistle. But you could sure tell he was fired up.''</p>
        <p>Armstrong added: ''Winning cures a lot of ills. After two losses on the road, we really needed this game.''</p>
        <p>The Dolphins secured it with perhaps the strongest performance of the season by quarterback Dan Marino, whose play in recent weeks has been publicly questioned by Coach Jimmy Johnson. Marino completed 19 of 31 passes today for 259 yards, 1 touchdown and no interceptions.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, 4 of those passes went for 80 yards to tight end Troy Drayton, who had caught just 7 passes for 109 yards in the previous four games.</p>
        <p>''The tight end really hasn't shown much in this offense,'' Drayton said. ''It looks like that worked to the Chiefs' disadvantage today.''</p>
        <p>Because the Chiefs play mostly man-to-man defense, Marino said, Miami's plan was to induce their safety to one side of the field, while passing to Drayton or a running back on the other.</p>
        <p>''A couple of times Troy was covered and I just threw it in there and he made the grab,'' Marino said.</p>
        <p>Today's victory, gained on Olindo Mare's 26-yard field goal 5:40 from the finish, sets up a Miami visit to Giants Stadium next Sunday to play the resurgent Jets.</p>
        <p>''We are really not far away,'' Johnson said. ''I have been saying this time and time again. We are getting down in scoring territory and we are just having a play here or there keeping us out of the end zone.''</p>
        <p>The Dolphins failed to get a first down on all but one of their first four series. Yet they cashed in on that other one. A 15-yard personal-foul penalty on linebacker Bobby Houston set up Miami at the Kansas City 44, and it took the hosts four plays to score, even with a 10-yard holding penalty. Marino completions of 25 and 18 yards to wide receiver O. J. McDuffie fueled the drive, with the score coming on running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar's 10-yard run 9:25 into the game.</p>
        <p>Kansas City drew even early in the second quarter. It went 65 yards in 12 plays, although the touchdown was facilitated when cornerback Terrell Buckley caught one of his spikes in the grass. That freed Andre Rison for a 16-yard touchdown in the end zone's right corner, although Grbac's wobbly throw almost went wide.</p>
        <p>Linebacker Terry Wooden's third down tackle of Abdul-Jabbar for a 3-yard loss forced Miami into a quick punt on the next possession. The Chiefs then grabbed the lead, aided by a 23-yard punt by the Dolphins' Kyle Richardson that sailed well out of bounds.</p>
        <p>A 17-yard reverse by split end Tamarick Vanover put the Chiefs at the Miami 33. Four plays later, in a two-tight-end formation, Grbac found backup tight end Tony Gonzalez for a 21-yard score.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins tied it 1:11 before halftime on a less-than-textbook, 9-play, 95-yard drive. Mostly, Miami rode Marino's arm. He had 27- and 28-yard gains to Drayton, a 16-yarder to McDuffie and then the payoff: a shuffling 7-yarder to running back Bernie Parmalee.</p>
        <p>The second half was mostly forgettable. Before Miami's modest decisive drive, the Dolphins produced the only real scoring threat. Early in the third quarter, they reached the Kansas City 24-yard-line, but Mare's 41-yard field-goal attempt was wide right.</p>
        <p>''We didn't play the way we think we are capable,'' Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer said. ''We had innumerable opportunities, both offensively and defensively. We have some playmakers, guys who can do some things, but we didn't get it done.''</p>
