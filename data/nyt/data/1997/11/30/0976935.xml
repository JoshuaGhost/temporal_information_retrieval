        <p>In the end, Eddie Robinson's finale wasn't much of a game. The 588th game of his career was an accurate synopsis of everything that had changed, everything that had gone wrong, everything that had allowed the competition to close the gap, finally catch up and pass him by.</p>
        <p>Southern 30, Grambling 7.</p>
        <p>Pete Richardson defeated Robinson for the fifth straight time and won the Southwestern Athletic Conference championship yesterday. The Jaguars could have scored 20 more points, but compassion and honor were the rules of this day.</p>
        <p>''I wanted him to win,'' Richardson said. ''I think he's a winner in life. You have to respect what he's accomplished all these years. But I have an obligation to my football team; we wanted to win a championship for our 12 seniors. We had to take the emotional part out of it and do what we were geared to do.''</p>
        <p>This was the final stop on Robinson's farewell tour. He had watched his share of coaches come and go. Some left on their own, some left kicking and screaming. Robinson would leave kicking. For the last three seasons, Robinson, 78, used the considerable clout he accumulated over 57 years at Grambling to hold on, to keep his position as coach. As the losses mounted, the outcry became so loud that he was removed; then he was given one last season.</p>
        <p>''Deep down,'' said Collie Nicholson, Grambling's sports information director for 30 years, ''Eddie thought that he was going to turn it around this year.''</p>
        <p>In the last three weeks, Nicholson said, the reality that Robinson's run was over began to set in with the coach. He wouldn't turn it around; he would go out with three straight losing seasons. By the end of one quarter yesterday afternoon, Robinson realized he would lose his eighth game of the season (against three victories) and it would not be close.</p>
        <p>''I think what's been happening,'' Richardson said, ''is that he doesn't have the athletes that he had years back, and he's running the same formation.''</p>
        <p>So the seconds ticked down, and the news media and the well-wishers crowded around him the way they had in the aftermath of his other milestones: his 500th game coached, in 1990; his 323d victory, in 1985 to tie Bear Bryant for the most by college coaches, and his 324th victory to surpass him. Yesterday, they crowded around Robinson, who retires with a 408-165-15 record, as much to numb the sting of a final loss as to honor him.</p>
        <p>As the clock wound down and Robinson looked around, he may have begun to glimpse the larger picture. Former players, celebrities, men and women who had never gone near Grambling, La., who had never run a lap, were applauding, crying. Ahmad Rashad, the NBC sportscaster and former pro football player who played collegiately at Oregon, recalled how, after recruiting trips to Notre Dame, his father humbled him by asking: ''Has Eddie Robinson called you yet? You haven't done anything if Eddie Robinson hasn't called.''</p>
        <p>Gary Sheffield, the Florida Marlins' star outfielder, went to the pros right out of high school. He came yesterday afternoon for several reasons.</p>
        <p>''I always wondered what it would have been like had I gone to college, how my life would have been, especially if I would have been around someone like Coach Robinson,'' he said. ''This builds you up to be a man. When I got to the big leagues, I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to be a man. I was supposed to be in school.''</p>
        <p>Mostly, Sheffield said, he came for Robinson. ''I'm just here to pay my respects to Coach Robinson,'' he said. ''You see how coaches come and go, but for someone to do this for 57 years is amazing in itself.</p>
        <p>''My granddad taught me my history about black coaches and black athletes, things like that -- the ins and outs of the game and an understanding of the game, the history of the game. By me being around nine years in the big leagues, I got more educated about it. I always followed Coach Robinson and read about people like Jackie Robinson.''</p>
        <p>After the game the Louisiana state police escorted Robinson to an elevated platform on the 50-yard line, where he would accept plaques and  awards. As he waited with his wife, Doris, for cameras to set up and photographers to position themselves, Robinson looked around, fighting off tears. A young man standing near the edge of the stage exhorted Robinson to keep his composure, the way a coach might holler at a player executing a difficult drill. ''Hold on, coach,'' he hollered. ''Suck it up, coach.''</p>
        <p>Finally, as Richardson joined him on the podium, Robinson broke down, and the two hugged.</p>
        <p>Robinson received a plaque, a car and finally a call from President Clinton. Later, in a massive post-game interview room, Robinson, not quite sure what to say, and having so much to say, tried to put the day in perspective.</p>
        <p>''In the years, I've learned to win without bragging and lose without offering excuses,'' he said. ''We don't have any excuses. If I said I was glad to be here,'' he said of the post-game news conference, ''it wouldn't be true, because we lost.''</p>
        <p>And despite the loss to end his career, Robinson was philosophical.</p>
        <p>''Grambling and Southern played in the Louisiana Superdome, one of the finest facilities in the country,'' he said. ''When I came to Grambling, I never ever thought it was possible. America's No. 1 person just called me on the phone,'' he said, referring to the President. ''This doesn't happen to everybody.''</p>
