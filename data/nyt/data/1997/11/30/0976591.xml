        <p>WHEN you say you are going to Scotland on a culinary tour, some people think of haggis, porridge and overcooked meat -- but that's only because they have not kept up with the dramatic improvement in restaurant dining there in the last several years.</p>
        <p>Scotland has always had the raw ingredients to produce superb cuisine, but for years Scots ''sent it south,'' not only to England but also to France. Now they keep some of it at home: exquisite fish from their pristine waters; succulent lamb, and beef that tastes like beef, from the Highlands; superb vegetables and fruits, particularly stone fruits like peaches and plums. You can travel the country in pursuit of the best golf courses or the finest antiques; hike the hills or simply enjoy the rugged coastline and highland heather, and when you stop for the night you can eat like an indulgent gourmet. From Farleyer House Hotel in Aberfeldy in central Scotland to Inverlochy Castle near Fort William in the west, the culinary component of a trip in late summer was a revelation to those with whom I traveled -- but not to me, because I visited Scotland six years ago and ate exceedingly well then, too.</p>

        <p>WHEN you say you are going to Scotland on a culinary tour, some people think of haggis, porridge and overcooked meat -- but that's only because they have not kept up with the dramatic improvement in restaurant dining there in the last several years.</p>
        <p>Scotland has always had the raw ingredients to produce superb cuisine, but for years Scots ''sent it south,'' not only to England but also to France. Now they keep some of it at home: exquisite fish from their pristine waters; succulent lamb, and beef that tastes like beef, from the Highlands; superb vegetables and fruits, particularly stone fruits like peaches and plums. You can travel the country in pursuit of the best golf courses or the finest antiques; hike the hills or simply enjoy the rugged coastline and highland heather, and when you stop for the night you can eat like an indulgent gourmet. From Farleyer House Hotel in Aberfeldy in central Scotland to Inverlochy Castle near Fort William in the west, the culinary component of a trip in late summer was a revelation to those with whom I traveled -- but not to me, because I visited Scotland six years ago and ate exceedingly well then, too.</p>
        <p>Going from one country house hotel to another, with a couple of stops for lunch at highly recommended restaurants, three friends and I dined in settings that ranged from sophisticated modern at Braeval in Aberfoyle, 22 miles north of Glasgow, to  utter simplicity at the Peat Inn, a 250-year-old former coaching stop just north of Edinburgh, where I had dined before. Whether the food had a French grounding or was simply prepared in the Scottish manner designed to display the impeccable quality of the ingredients, most of the people doing the cooking knew what they were about.</p>
        <p>Wine lists, though usually expensive, were generally quite sophisticated and, of course, the single-malt Scotch lists made the fanciers in our party ecstatic. They would have been even happier if the Scots would stop following the European Community's regulation that limits the size of a drink to, at most, 35 milliters or just over an ounce -- think thimbleful. (This can't be what they mean by a wee dram.) And while we were not in Scotland during game season, those traveling now will find a wide variety on the menu, from pheasant and partridge to venison and woodcock.</p>
        <p>Braeval</p>
        <p>As soon as we walked into the wonderful old stone building with a fireplace in the middle of the room, we knew old Scotland had been left behind. The stunning  owner and hostess, Fiona Nairn, was dressed in Issey  Miyake: my companions were expecting pearls and a twin sweater set.</p>
        <p>The tables in the intimate dining room were set with cream linen; beige draperies contrasted with chairs that matched the cobalt blue glasses. The tableau made the appropriate backdrop for the superb prix fixe lunch. Having gotten slightly lost on the way, we tore into the homemade bread flecked with tomato and caraway and tried not to guzzle the lovely pink kir.</p>
        <p>Soon handsome plates of seared sea bass arrived, accompanied by a salad of tomato,  avocado and olive oil. They were followed by chicken that had been brushed with soy and roasted to perfection, served with chanterelles and roasted vegetables, a rich dauphinois potato cake accented with a touch of lemon and wild asparagus.</p>
        <p>Perhaps we would not have ordered dessert, but when it comes with the meal who can say no? And a good thing, too: it was a warm, delicately light and soft chocolate cake with chocolate sauce accompanied by mascarpone sorbet.</p>
        <p>Unlike most of the restaurants we visited,  Braeval offered many fairly priced wines: a nice assortment of reasonable house wines in the $30 range and a good selection by the glass. We drank a 1996 Macon Charnay from Tripoz ($29 a bottle, $6 a glass). It came as no surprise that the restaurant has one Michelin star.</p>
        <p>Peat Inn</p>
        <p>Across the country, on the east coast of Scotland in Fife, David Wilson has been preaching the glories of Scottish ingredients for a quarter of a century at the Peat Inn. The simple whitewashed building with its charming back garden began life as a coach stop in 1750.</p>
        <p>After a perfect lunch Mr. Wilson sat with us for a moment and talked about his food, describing his style of cooking as ''modern Scottish,'' adding, ''and it doesn't mean anything.'' He's wrong about that. Every ingredient is local and fresh and is cooked in a straightforward fashion with the obvious underpinnings of classical French training. The restaurant's style, on the other hand, seems to be Scottish with Spanish overtones, with lots of wrought iron.</p>
        <p>There are three small dining rooms. Lunch is a set menu that began that day with salmon from local waters, hot smoked and accompanied by baby greens, dressed with olive and walnut oils and white wine vinegar. It was followed by a terrine of pristine white sole flecked with bits of carrot and sauced with a delightfully sharp, light homemade mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>Tender and meaty pan-fried pigeon that had been marinated in soy and Chinese spices, then braised, was served with a confit of spiced pork. The sophistication of Mr. Wilson's cooking was once again evident in the roasted monkfish with an elegant, light lobster sauce suffused with chanterelles.</p>
        <p>The wine list, obviously the work of a knowledgeable buyer, runs from inexpensive to stratospheric. The service, like the food, is impeccable but not off-putting.</p>
        <p>On a cold winter evening, there would be no cozier spot to sit before or after dinner than the living room with its roaring fire.</p>
        <p>Inverlochy Castle</p>
        <p>The season for grouse, which begins earlier than that of other game, had just started when we were in Scotland, and what better place to savor the bird (which I had never had before) than Inverlochy Castle in its 500 acres of landscaped gardens.</p>
        <p>Surely when it was a private home the service could not have been better than it was during our one-night stay. Despite the vastness of the stone Victorian building, the enormously high ceilings and the elaborate chandeliers, it was not intimidating, largely because of the friendly staff.</p>
        <p>We all loved the superbly executed classic grouse presentation, with bread sauce and a rich red wine sauce for the delicately gamy roasted bird. Brought to the table whole so we could see it, it was then whisked away to be carved into parts that made it possible to eat in a relatively mannerly fashion. We also made short work of the luscious brown crisp potatoes.</p>
        <p>If grouse had not been available there were other choices: a simple sea bass or succulent lamb in herb crust.</p>
        <p>The hand of a well-trained chef was apparent everywhere: in a comforting lightly curried parsnip and apple soup or a terrine of guinea fowl, venison, duck and chicken, a marvelous array of different textures.</p>
        <p>But last things first. When you walk into the grand high-ceilinged dining room where the silver gleams on heavy carved walnut tables set with white place mats, don't forget to order the house souffle, a soft meringue with orange marmalade and creme anglaise. You can have something else if you prefer -- during my visit the choices included an intensely flavored fruit sorbet or a lovely little chocolate cake -- but why would you? There is an impressive wine list but be prepared to pay dearly for a bottle. A 1990 Chateauneuf-du-Pape costs $39 for a half bottle.</p>
        <p>Farleyer House Hotel</p>
        <p>For those who pass up American beef because it has no taste, Scotland is the place to remember what it used to be. And Farleyer House Hotel at Aberfeldy in Perthshire is as good a place to try it as anywhere. The chef is happy to tell you its provenance --  an estate southeast of Glasgow -- and he certainly knows what to do with it. His red wine sauce doesn't hurt a bit.</p>
        <p>But what you will not forget, and will long for later, are the rock oysters from Skye, which speak volumes about the bounty of this country. They are not only enormous but sweet and succulent, tasting of the pristine waters from which they came.</p>
        <p>Other first courses included lightly smoked haddock with bacon and quail eggs or a fresh goat cheese salad. Marinated salmon is excellent here, but the rendition with orange sections did not work.</p>
        <p>Main courses include a lovely moist turbot or a rare duck magret. Vegetables arrive family style, each perfectly cooked. The use of local ingredients, complete with their pedigrees, and the appearance of steamed toffee pudding are constant reminders that you are in Scotland.</p>
        <p>Unlike so many renditions of this childhood favorite, the pudding was not achingly sweet. For something more sophisticated there is a deeply chocolate souffle with a perfect liquid center. Neither the creme brulee nor the tiramisu is up to the souffle.</p>
        <p>There is one non-culinary drawback to dining in this handsome country house, a former 16th-century croft that was gradually enlarged to become the estate of the Clan Menzies: The doors from the formal, candlelit dining room to the hall are not open and at night the room seems somewhat claustrophobic.</p>
        <p>Airds Hotel</p>
        <p>This is the inn that time has not touched. Airds at Port Appin, which is in Argyll, began life in 1700. The view from the dining room of Loch Linnhe and surrounding mountains makes you forget the loving-hands-at-home decor, cozy Scottish with a dizzying array of competing patterns. So does most of the food, which has earned a Michelin star. There are no startling dishes here, no fusion cooking. The chef, Graeme Allen, who took over from his mother, Betty Allen, who still runs the inn with her husband, Eric, is sticking to the classics and doing them well.</p>
        <p>Among them are an elegantly smooth terrine of chicken liver pate; old-fashioned beef with good meaty flavor, and duck with beautifully crisp skin and luscious pink meat. I would have preferred a less well-done piece of salmon but the unctuous hollandaise made up for the sin of overcooking. The vegetables, however, were perfect.</p>
        <p>For dessert the apple mousse was suffused with the intense tartness of dried apples; the chocolate mousse was too stiff. Although the wine list is well thought out, the well-priced bottles were not available when we were there.</p>
        <p>The staff at Airds seem naturally courteous and look as if they enjoy what they are doing. And while breakfast is not part of this article, anyone who has spent the night here and eaten Airds' long-cooking porridge with real cream; buttery, yeasty croissants; the fresh orange juice; the lemon curd, or the eggs with deep yellow yolks will understand why it must be remarked upon.</p>
        <p>Yes</p>
        <p>It's not exactly true that you have to have grown up eating haggis -- sheep's offal cooked in a sheep's stomach -- to enjoy it. Not when it has been taken out of the sheep's stomach (the major turnoff) and turned into a tiny layer cake with pureed turnips and mashed potatoes and given the hilariously over-the-top name of ''gateaux of haggis, neeps and tatties with whisky butter sauce.'' I licked my plate at Glasgow's stylish restaurant Yes, with its intense red and purple color scheme and cream walls. For the faint of heart there is a twice-baked Scottish Cheddar cheese souffle, all puffed up and filled with the intense flavor of a superb cheese.</p>
        <p>Main courses were excellent, if less challenging than haggis -- beautiful rack of lamb, risotto flavored with wild mushrooms and a seared breast of chicken on a bed of creamed spinach, with more of those excellent mushrooms.</p>
        <p>The passion fruit souffle was disappointing, but the depth of the flavors in a trio composed of orange-scented creme brulee, orange sorbet and lime tart compensated nicely. Best of all, Yes is a civilized place to dine; the spacious room with comfortable upholstered chairs has a distance between tables that makes private conversations possible. Clever lighting and mirrors make you forget you are in a basement restaurant.</p>
        <p>The wine list is extensive, with many bottles under $32.</p>
