      <abstract>
        <p>Genteel residents of New Canaan, Conn, wealthiest community in wealthiest state, see no resemblance to their lives in film The Ice Storm, Rick Moody's tale of dark suburban doings in 1973; photo; moviegoers recognize some local landmarks and recall actual ice storm, but say they have never even heard of 'key parties,' when women guests supposedly picked car keys out of bowl and went home with car's male owner (S)</p>

        <p>''Why should I mind it? It's fiction. I mean, we've never even heard of key parties.'' -- A 50-ish woman overheard at the New Canaan Playhouse after a showing of ''The Ice Storm.''</p>
        <p>''Worst movie I've ever seen. Ever.'' -- Her companion, a 50-ish man.</p>
        <p>OF all things, an ice storm was tearing through town just as the novelist who wrote ''The Ice Storm,'' Rick Moody, and its screenwriter, David Schamus, arrived at the New Canaan Playhouse for a Q. and A. on the story that has put New Canaan on the map.</p>
        <p>Freezing rain, whipped by 40-mile-an-hour winds, made the men in trench coats look like kites and the Jeeps and Range Rovers seem almost practical as they crept past the little downtown boutiques. The trees were encased in ice, just as they were in the climactic scenes of the movie. People at the theater thought it was a funny coincidence, not to mention a great icebreaker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moody, who recalls an unhappy adolescence here and whose novel paints a dark picture of adultery and anomie in the New Canaan of 1973, expected to be grilled ruthlessly. ''I found that the complete opposite was the case,'' he said, still amazed at the star treatment he received. ''The people who showed up were people interested in the book and, by and large, incredibly sweet about it.''</p>
        <p>Still. Here in the Next Station to Heaven, as the town likes to call itself, residents believe that the weather was the only aspect of New Canaan that ''The Ice Storm'' got right. Just as the novel and Ang Lee, the movie's director, depict it, there was a monster ice storm in Fairfield County in 1973, just after Thanksgiving. The power was out for days, and New Canaanites were forced to bunk in hotels and motels in Darien, even Stamford. But rampant sex and drugs and elephant bell-bottoms? In the land of Talbots?</p>
        <p>Since ''The Ice Storm'' opened at the New Canaan Playhouse in early November, people have lined up in the rain, in the ice storm, for matinees, even for the late shows. It has definitely been an event. But not since ''Fort Apache: The Bronx'' annoyed that borough's residents with its broad-brush sketch of street life has a place been so put off by the way its name has made its way into the national consciousness.</p>
        <p>No one is threatening a boycott or firing off angry letters to the editor of the local paper. (That happened last year, when the filming of a few key scenes proved an inconvenience.) But neither does New Canaan, the wealthiest state's wealthiest community, with an average household income of $173,000, relate -- in the least -- to the film's portrayal of a privileged suburb (prep schools, dinner parties, fancy houses) with a rotten soul.</p>
        <p>New Canaan (population 18,000) prides itself on its genteel tranquillity. So the film has inspired no shock waves of recognition or deep reflections over the too-small tables at Starbucks. No soul-searching in the local press. And no rave reviews, although it garnered its share after its premiere at the New York Film Festival this fall.</p>
        <p>''We just didn't like it,'' said Carrie Bonner, who was having a post-film cappuccino at Starbucks with her beau the other night. ''It was slow and dreary.''</p>
        <p>But comparing the reactions of moviegoers leaving ''The Ice Storm'' in New Canaan with those in Manhattan, it's as if people had seen two different films. In Manhattan, the movie has created a word-of-mouth buzz. Couples leaving screenings fall into animated discussions on the sidewalk. But in New Canaan, the post-show talk is more likely to center on how few recognizable landmarks the film contains.</p>
        <p>If ''The Ice Storm'' hasn't struck a chord here, could it have struck a nerve?</p>
        <p>As Richard Bond, New Canaan's First Selectman, or chief executive, tells it, not at all. ''That's ridiculous,'' he said. ''The people here are pretty sophisticated. They're not going to take the film personally. Most people think it could've taken place anywhere.''</p>
        <p>No one claims to recognize the New Canaan in the film, not even the New Canaan of a generation ago, when women didn't work, Watergate was in the news and the whole country was suffering from the post-traumatic stress of the Vietnam War. The preppie children, the commuters  in trench coats (all men) and the too-thin society wives in the movie are considered superficial details, like the ice storm itself.</p>
        <p>Janet Lindstrom, the president of the New Canaan Historical Society, remembers that the town during the era of the big ice storm was much the same way it is now. ''People always seem to be involved in schools and family, the kinds of things that have made New Canaan such a wonderful place to live,'' she said. ''It's not to say that what was described in 'The Ice Storm' didn't happen here. Maybe it did. I just know a very different New Canaan.''</p>
        <p>Like others, Ms. Lindstrom said that before ''The Ice Storm,'' she had never heard of key parties. (In the movie, couples drop their car keys into a bowl; later in the evening, each wife fishes out a set and has to go home and sleep with the husband who owns them.) ''Maybe it happened -- I don't know,'' she said. ''But if it did, it was a very small aspect of life here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bond said friends who had seen the film got a kick out of the three small scenes with recognizable local landmarks: the library, the train station and Varnum's drugstore. And that was about it.</p>
        <p>''No one I know who has seen the film enjoyed it,'' he said. He himself thought the film was ''terrible'' and the book ''awful.''</p>
        <p>''There's nothing redeeming about it or any of the characters,'' he said. ''If you liked it, then you're definitely in the minority. People who I've talked to all say it was a very dark, depressing film. Everyone was so unattractive, even Sigourney Weaver.''</p>
        <p>Out of a dozen people asked for a reaction outside the New Canaan Playhouse the other night, only one, Ken Carhart, said he enjoyed it. ''I wasn't bored at all,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he lives in Darien.</p>
