        <p>Warm in atmosphere, if a little busy in the decor, this engaging little American restaurant beneath the Washington Square Hotel offers pleasing comfort food prepared with skill and care. On the menu are featured appetizers of fried calamari with chipotle aioli; tartare of tuna in a zesty seasoning of sesame oil, chili, ginger and scallions; salmon gravlax, cured with tequila and chili and paired with salsa, and a classic Caesar salad complete with croutons and Parmesan shavings. There are entrees of roast chicken with natural juices and truffle-scented whipped potatoes; seared salmon complimented by a lentil-basil coulis and a wintery garnish of spinach and beets; wild mushroom risotto in a rosemary jus enhanced by truffle oil,  and roast loin of pork with mustard greens and apricot-cranberry chutney.

        <p>With Drovers, David Page and Barbara Shinn, the husband-wife team who also own Home on Cornelia Street, have tried to recreate the sort of Midwestern family restaurant Mr. Page remembers from his childhood in Wisconsin. You can't go wrong with appetizers like caramelized onion tart paired with blue  cheese and pears; smoked trout garnished with jicama and apple slaw tossed in ginger-scallion sauce; or the salad of roasted beets, chicory and wild mushrooms in goat cheese dressing. Enticing entrees include broiled lamb with goat cheese polenta and vegetable ragout; roast cod enhanced by an orange-grapefruit sauce and served with wild rice and artichokes; beef stewed in red wine, and fried fish with tartar sauce, cole slaw and potato salad. ($25 and Under: 5/9/97)</p>
        <p>IL MULINO ** [rating: two stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 673-3783; 86 West Third Street, near Sullivan Street; $$$$; American Express, Mastercard, Visa.</p>
        <p>Legions of loyal followers flock to Il Mulino for its satisfying homespun Italian fare served in gargantuan portions. Dinner might begin with a dish of shrimp fricassee with garlic; bresaola of beef served over mixed greens tossed in a well-seasoned vinaigrette, or aromatic baked clams oreganato. The pasta roster could include fettuccine Alfredo; spaghettini in a robust Bolognese sauce; trenette tossed in pesto sauce; and capellini all'arrabbiata, or in a spicy tomato sauce. The menu carries a dozen veal preparations, along with beef tenderloin in a shallot, white wine and sage sauce, and broiled sirloin. (Review: 6/19/92)</p>

        <p>A mischievous name belies some serious food at this Middle Eastern restaurant. The food is what attracts the nightly crowds of young people who are willing to wait to jam into the disheveled 24-seat dining room. Begin with a starter sampler of sprightly spreads like smoky baba gannouj, hummus, and mixture of spinach and chickpeas with lemon, chopped tomato and onion. Scooped up with warm puffy pita bread, they are delicious. Moustache specializes in ''pitzas,'' pizzas made with pita dough. A standout among the offerings is the lahambajin with a crisp crust and a distinct Middle Eastern flavor with its savory topping of ground lamb, onions, tomatoes and spices. Also good are the tomato-and-cheese pizzas, topped with artichokes or merguez sausage. ($25 and Under: 7/26/96)</p>

        <p>(212) 620-0393; 314 West 11th Street, at Greenwich Street; $; American Express, Mastercard, Visa.</p>
        <p>This smart, bustling little French hot spot has real bistro atmosphere. The Gallic fare is pleasing and inventive, including starters of seared scallops enhanced by a confit of tomato, orange and mango; squash ravioli with mascarpone cheese and mingled flavors of nutmeg and cinnamon; or a hearty salad combining celeriac, cauliflower, cranberry beans and apples in a verjus dressing. Among main courses, there is  roast veal tenderloin in port wine reduction with an accompaniment of baby root vegetables; leg of lamb au jus and complemented by Swiss chard and potato gratin; seared salmon in a spice crust, in a pool of red wine sauce and garnished with a carrot-spinach medley; and pan-roasted monkfish in a saffron-tomato cream with braised leeks. ($25 and Under: 7/21/95)</p>
        <p>MI COCINA ** [rating: two stars]  (212) 627-8273; 57 Jane Street, at Hudson Street; $$; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This bustling eight-year old Mexican restaurant remains as genuine and spirited as ever, and judging by the crowds, still a favorite among neighborhood residents. Dinner appetizers include quesadillas de hongos, little turnovers filled with shiitake mushrooms and cheese with a roasted tomato sauce; fried calamari with salsa ranchera and lime, and gutsy slow-cooked snails in a roasted garlic and tomato sauce enriched with capers, olives and chile guero. Recommended are main courses of chicken enchiladas under a rich and complex mole poblano sauce; cochinita pibil, a dish of succulent, fork-tender roast pork cooked in banana leaves with seasonings of achiote and sour orange and flanked by rice, salsa and warm, soft tortillas; and chile en nogada, a classic dish of roast poblano stuffed with a mixture of pork picadillo, almond and raisins and topped with a cream sauce with pomegranate seeds.

        <p>A warm, cozy setting combined with reliably tasty fare and attentive service is what this welcoming Italian spot delivers. A recent visit confirmed that. To begin, try the pleasing antipasto plate holding selections of beets vinaigrette, grilled asparagus and endive, mushrooms, chickpeas, fresh mozzarella and more. Other choices include stuffed artichokes; prosciutto and melon; and escarole sauteed with garlic in olive oil. Among main courses, linguine comes in a tasty white clam sauce; lasagna is served with a lusty Bolognese sauce; penne is light, simply tossed with broccoli, zucchini and garlic; and lobster fra diavalo is paired with a mildly spicy tomato sauce.

        <p>A gregarious mix of Europeans and Americans flock to this small, handsome little bar and restaurant with neighborly tables for its congenial atmosphere, excellent Portuguese food and intriguing wines. The wonderful bread comes straight from the Portuguese bakeries in Newark. For appetizers, there are  caldo verde, the hearty potato and kale soups with slices of linguica (mild Portuguese sausage); grilled squid in lemon-and-mustard sauce, and marinated sardines in a red-pepper-and-onion marinade. Main courses include slices of pork loin served with clams and potatoes in a red pepper sauce; grilled shrimp served over a lemony bread pudding studded with clams and shrimp; stewed rabbit in red wine sauce with hazelnuts; and bacalhau, a traditional dish of sauteed salt cod served with onions and potatoes.
