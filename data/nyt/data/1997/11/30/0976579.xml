        <p>JUDITH L. TREZZA lived with her family in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, for 20 years before moving to Manhattan as a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology. She traveled widely in Europe studying art, but she called TriBeCa and Times Square home when she returned.</p>
        <p>So when it was suggested several months ago that the 26-year-old artist consider a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, her first reaction was: No Way.</p>
        <p>''The thought of moving back to Brooklyn just made me crazy,'' said Ms. Trezza, who also manages a rental photography studio. ''It's like going back to an old hometown after having made it in the city.''</p>
        <p>In addition, she said, many Manhattanites attach a kind of stigma to the other boroughs.</p>
        <p>''People are like: 'A 718 area code? You live in Brooklyn?' '' said Ms. Trezza -- who with a pierced tongue and yellow hair going toward neon green doesn't seem the type to worry about what others might think of her area code.</p>
        <p>But the economic reality of space in Manhattan can be persuasive. Ms. Trezza looked at some 40 spaces in two months. She had budgeted about $2,000 a month, but her situation was complicated because she also needed studio space for her work. Her plan was to find a one-bedroom for about $1,200 or $1,300 and then rent studio space separately.</p>
        <p>''Everything was either too expensive, too small or rundown,'' said Ms. Trezza. ''If it was in my price range it was really rundown.''</p>
        <p>WITH loft space in TriBeCa and SoHo really out of her budget, a real estate agent suggested she consider a two-bedroom loft apartment in Brooklyn at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge. Ms. Trezza, whose two most important requirements were light and space, thought she had nothing to lose by looking at the building at 180 South Fourth Street (the main entrance is actually on South Fifth Street).</p>
        <p>''Once I saw the space, that was it,'' she said. ''It was flooded with light.''</p>
        <p>At $1,900 a month, it fit her pocketbook and her needs perfectly. Not only was there an extra bedroom, which she could use as an office and for visitors -- of which she has many as a result of her travels -- but the large open living area fit in nicely with her love of entertaining. Her favorite feature, however, was a closet-size room with a window, which she uses for her gilding projects. She has a degree in art history with a minor in archeology, and is working toward a degree in restoration at F.I.T.</p>
        <p>''I've only been here a month, and my favorite place is my gilding studio,'' she said. ''No one's allowed in there but me. I read and I listen to music and I think. It's like my little escape.''</p>
        <p>IT'S also imperative to the type of work she does. In gilding, the materials used to make the gold leaf adhere to the surface must stay at a constant warm temperature to be applied properly. A small room makes it easy to maintain that temperature.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trezza has found her neighborhood a rich source of the old pieces of furniture and decorative items she needs to practice her art. ''I need to get old pieces I can restore without them being very, very valuable,'' she said, noting that there were a variety of junk stores in the neighborhood with prices well below what she would find in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Still, Manhattan is just one subway stop away. And she frequently rides her bike to work at Studio With a View, which is on West 31st Street near the Hudson River. ''It's a 30-minute ride door-to-door,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While she still does much of her grocery shopping in Manhattan, she said, a number of cafes and galleries are beginning to appear in her neighborhood as it becomes more popular. ''There's a lot of artists living down here,'' she said. ''They couldn't afford Manhattan rents anymore, much like what's been happening in Dumbo,'' she said, referring to another artists' enclave in Brooklyn:  Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass.</p>
        <p>Artists started moving to Williamsburg more than a decade ago. Jeffrey Cohen, a real estate agent with Citi Habitats who worked with Ms. Trezza, said the trend had been picking up recently as the market heated up in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Trezza said that the tenants in her building include a graphic artist, photographers, models and a tattoo artist. The building, which originally had 35 units, has been converted into 12 apartments, two on each floor of the six-story building.</p>
        <p>MS. TREZZA said some of her friends still refuse to cross the river for her dinner parties and Ping-Pong games. But her 1,600 square feet has not gone unnoticed by other artist friends. One has set up a light table, and another stores photography equipment there -- but in such a large space it is barely noticeable.</p>
        <p>From the large windows surrounding her living room, Ms. Trezza looked out at the base of the Williamsburg Bridge over the dome of an old bank, which is being restored for a church. From another angle, children could be seen skateboarding in a park across the street.</p>
        <p>''At 6 o'clock in the morning as the sun rises this place is flooded with gorgeous red and orange light,'' she said, ''and it sets through my studio window.''</p>
        <p>Her die-hard Manhattan attitude has all but vanished.</p>
        <p>''You can go to Manhattan and work and you can actually come home and have a life rather than working all the time to pay the rent,'' she said. ''Now I'm a Brooklyn spokesperson. It's nice because it's helping me to get back to my Brooklyn roots.''</p>
