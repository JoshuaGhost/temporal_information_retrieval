        <p>President Clinton is preparing for another election-year battle over health care as he proposes sweeping new Federal regulations for insurance companies and health maintenance organizations to protect patients' rights.</p>
        <p>A Presidential advisory panel recommended last week a bill of rights for patients. But in urging Congress to translate the rights into law, Mr. Clinton went beyond the recommendations of the 34-member panel, which reserved judgment on who should enforce the proposed standards.</p>
        <p>In advocating regulation, Democrats believe that they have a winning issue that resonates with voters, many of whom have had frustrating experiences with health maintenance organizations. White House officials said they would welcome a fight over the issue, which they expect will unite Democrats and divide Republicans in the election season next year.</p>
        <p>Health insurance has historically been regulated by the states. Democrats see a clear need for Federal laws and regulations to set standards for insurers and H.M.O.'s. More than a third of Congressional Republicans, including some conservatives, support such legislation, which would help consumers navigate a rapidly changing health system.</p>
        <p>But the House Republicans' floor leader, Dick Armey of Texas, and the Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, adamantly oppose a new regulatory regime, saying it would increase the cost of benefits. The higher costs, they say, would force employers to cut back health benefits, increasing the number of uninsured Americans and whetting the public appetite for new Government health programs.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Mr. Clinton enthusiastically endorsed the proposals, which would give consumers access to additional information about the quality of health plans, the right to appeal a denial of care or reimbursement and an assurance that medical records would be kept confidential. Similar proposals were in Mr. Clinton's ill-fated scheme to redesign the  health care system in 1993 and 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is no longer proposing universal insurance coverage, a standard package of benefits or a requirement for employers to provide such benefits. But the President made clear that the old impulses, the yearnings for health security for all, are just below the surface.</p>
        <p>''There is,'' he said, ''an emerging consensus that while people may not have wanted to bite the whole apple at once in 1994, almost the whole population wants to keep nibbling away at the apple until we actually have solved the problems of cost, accessibility and quality for all responsible American citizens.''</p>
        <p>Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, the chief lobbyist for H.M.O.'s, spoke for many in the industry when she said, ''It's beginning to feel a lot like 1993.''</p>
        <p>Some members of the President's advisory panel were stunned by the speed of his endorsement, which pre-empts much of the work they had been planning to carry out in the next four months.</p>
        <p>The panel would never have achieved consensus if members had known that their recommendations would be the basis for new laws. Many members prefer using private accreditation agencies to insure compliance with the proposed standards.</p>
        <p>One panel member, J. Randall MacDonald, executive vice president of the GTE Corporation, said, ''These standards can be carried out voluntarily, without the need for Federal legislation.''</p>
        <p>GTE, which provides health coverage to 400,000 people, said it would voluntarily adopt the standards.</p>
        <p>In its report to the President, the panel skirted the question of how to enforce and carry out the proposed rights.</p>
        <p>''The rights enumerated in this report,'' the panel said, ''can be achieved in several ways, including voluntary actions by health plans, purchasers, facilities and providers; the effects of market forces; accreditation processes, as well as state or Federal legislation or regulation.''</p>
        <p>The group promised to choose among the alternatives in its final report, due on March 30.</p>
        <p>The question of enforcing patients' rights is more explosive than the substance of the guarantees.</p>
        <p>Another commission member, Gail L. Warden, president of the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, said, ''It's premature to be proposing how the bill of rights should be implemented.''</p>
        <p>The prospect of new laws may discourage employers and health plans from ''buying into what we're trying to accomplish,'' Mr. Warden said.</p>
        <p>More than 200 House members, including 91 Republicans, are co-sponsors of a comprehensive bill to set detailed standards for the operations of H.M.O.'s and health insurance companies. The bill, introduced by Representative Charlie Norwood, Republican of Georgia, is supported by some conservative Republicans.</p>
        <p>Melody J. Harned, a lobbyist at the Health Insurance Association of America, said that on the issue of standards, ''the far left and the far right are coalescing, it seems.''</p>
        <p>In a memorandum last month, Ms. Harned said, ''The message we are getting from House and Senate leadership is that we are in a war and need to start fighting like we're in a war'' over the Federal regulation of health insurance.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore took up the challenge. ''If any special interests want to make this a war, it's one we're proud to fight in behalf of America's families.''</p>
        <p>Representative Marge Roukema, a moderate Republican from New Jersey, cautioned her party's leaders. ''The handwriting is on the wall,'' Mrs. Roukema said. ''We can't be practicing medicine on the floor of the House of Representatives. But we've got to have some national standards, because Americans are extremely concerned about the practices of H.M.O.'s. If the Republican Party hopes to remain a national majority party, it can't just stand there saying no, as it has in the past.''</p>
