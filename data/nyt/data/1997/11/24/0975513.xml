        <p>The likelihood that Attorney General Janet Reno will reject the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate fund-raising phone calls by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore has created a strain between the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Government officials said today.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's top aides oppose the appointment, and a memorandum with the departmental recommendation is making its way up the Justice Department chain of command to the Attorney General. Justice Department officials said today that Ms. Reno has not made up her mind and will decide the issue only after she reviews the final recommendations.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno has until Dec. 2 to decide whether to go ahead with an independent prosecutor to investigate the President and Vice President, but officials have said she might make the decision on Monday or Tuesday, before she leaves on an official trip to Mexico.</p>
        <p>Law-enforcement officials also expect that Ms. Reno will not seek the appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate accusations that former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary sought a donation for a charity in exchange for agreeing to meet with a group of Asian business officials. But the law-enforcement officials said that the decision regarding Ms. O'Leary was a close legal call and that the debate over the decision might delay the announcement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno has faced a furious outcry from Republicans in Congress over her refusal to seek an independent prosecutor, and F.B.I. Director Louis J. Freeh, a former prosecutor and Federal judge, has advised her that he also believes she should refer the case to an outside counsel.</p>
        <p>With Ms. Reno likely to reject such an appointment, F.B.I. officials said they were concerned that the agency's support for an independent prosecutor had not been adequately factored into Justice Department decision-making. Some law-enforcement officials have said in recent days that they regard that decision-making process as practically a formality because of the widening consensus within the Justice Department that no independent prosecutor is needed.</p>
        <p>But last month, Ms. Reno told House members at a hearing that she would not shut down any specific line of inquiry without the concurrence of the F.B.I. Director. Mr. Freeh has not discussed with Ms. Reno her decision on the Clinton-Gore matter, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department recommendation must still be presented to Eric H. Holder Jr., the deputy attorney general, before the matter goes to Ms. Reno. F.B.I. officials are said to be worried that Ms. Reno will, in effect, close down the Clinton-Gore inquiries despite her pledge to Mr. Freeh, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>Today, an F.B.I. official said the agency was concerned that mid-level lawyers at the Justice Department had portrayed the law-enforcement agency as supportive of a decision, when in fact the F.B.I. had not yet fully presented its views to department lawyers. Nevertheless, a Justice Department official played down the tension between the two agencies. ''Louie Freeh knows how to call Janet Reno,'' the official said. ''He can get a hold of her any time.''</p>
        <p>Still, F.B.I. officials said they feared the decision against an outside inquiry could mean that the investigation of Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore is at an end, even though Ms. Reno has repeatedly said that her own campaign finance team would continue its investigation and that she would reconsider any independent counsel decision at any time if there is new evidence to warrant it.</p>
        <p>Law-enforcement officials said that F.B.I. officials wanted Ms. Reno to turn over the entire campaign finance inquiry to an outside prosecutor because it involves high-level officials whose activities can be more credibly examined by an outside prosecutor rather than by Ms. Reno's lawyers at the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno has steadfastly resisted such an appointment, saying that she must assess whether to appoint an independent prosecutor on the basis of whether officials like Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore violated specific statutes -- like the 114-year-old Pendleton Act, which makes it a crime for Government officials to solicit money on Federal property. The law was intended to prevent political appointees from shaking down their subordinates.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno's lawyers have spent two months analyzing whether Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore violated the law. Prosecutors have interviewed the President and Vice President and departmental lawyers have conducted an exhaustive analysis of the law -- concluding that they could not bring a case against either Mr. Clinton or Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has said he might have made fund-raising phone calls but cannot remember any specific calls. Mr. Gore said he made dozens of fund-raising calls, but only for donations to generic party efforts, not for purposes that Ms. Reno has said might be illegal: direct contributions for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign. No Government official has ever been prosecuted for soliciting private citizens in their homes or offices.</p>
