      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The American conductor Richard Westerfield, recently appointed the associate conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, first performed with the New York Philharmonic in 1993, when he substituted at the last minute for an ailing Erich Leinsdorf. On Thursday night, he conducted the orchestra for the first time in a subscription concert, highlighted by a blazing, authoritative performance of Shostakovich's sprawling Eighth Symphony.</p>
        <p>This mercurial five-movement symphony is framed by a tormented Adagio that begins with a ruminative pianissimo melody for strings, but erupts along its way with fitful spasms of brassy angst and a quizzical, quietly restless final Allegretto. The middle movements have been described as a trio of marches: a sort of mock-heroic forced march, a savagely grotesque scherzo and a muted funereal march, actually a set of variations over a haunting, elongated passacaglia bass theme.</p>

        <p>This mercurial five-movement symphony is framed by a tormented Adagio that begins with a ruminative pianissimo melody for strings, but erupts along its way with fitful spasms of brassy angst and a quizzical, quietly restless final Allegretto.

        <p>Mr. Westerfield's performance was impassioned yet impressively controlled. Interpreters differ on whether the bombastic moments of this work are meant to be bitterly ironic. Mr. Westerfield's relentless approach was too hot to be ironic. He might have tried for more ambiguity, but the performance was always arresting and the orchestra played brilliantly. The program also featured the Philharmonic debut of the Japanese violinist Akiko Suwanai, who has garnered several competition prizes. Ms. Suwanai, a splendid violinist, brought vigor, virtuosity and an enormous, rich tone to her performance of Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto. It is hard to distinguish yourself musically in this repertory staple. Every good violinist plays it, and often. But Ms. Suwanai played it very well indeed.</p>
