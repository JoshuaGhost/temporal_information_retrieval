        <p>Every year, Representative Christopher H. Smith waits in the wings and, just as Congress is ripping toward the finish line, he forces colleagues to revisit the explosive question of abortion.</p>
        <p>The request is akin to dumping a barrel of marbles across the Capitol's polished floors, tripping up fragile last-minute agreements and threatening to delay scores of plane reservations home.</p>
        <p>Usually, Mr. Smith, a New Jersey Republican, loses the struggle.</p>
        <p>This year, he lost again. But he also won.</p>
        <p>For the first time ever, Mr. Smith said, Republican leaders in the House stood unequivocally behind him as he tried to cut off all Federal money for abortions abroad. It was a move clearly meant to mollify conservatives who have been less than pleased with Speaker Newt Gingrich's compromising bent.</p>
        <p>And, he said, the leaders pledged to do the same again next year.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it is a sea change,'' Mr. Smith said, reflecting on the leadership's support last week. ''It's not the Smith amendment anymore. It's their policy, too, now. They understand it sufficiently that they generally will endure a tremendous amount of unpleasantness to see that this comes to pass.''</p>
        <p>What passed in the waning hours of the session flabbergasted big-league players from President Clinton to Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations to the champion of conservative causes, Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, who also strongly opposes abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, with the backing of Mr. Gingrich, managed to derail a tangle of carefully thought-out plans affecting the United Nations and the State Department.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Smith has demanded an outright ban on Federal money funneled to foreign family planning agencies that perform abortions or lobby their Government in favor of abortion. Ronald Reagan and George Bush both instituted the policy during their Presidencies, but Mr. Clinton, who supports abortion rights, overturned it.</p>
        <p>In the push for a deal on a broad range of end-of-term legislation, Mr. Gingrich and Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, persuaded Mr. Smith and his colleagues to take a deep breath and compromise on abortion.</p>
        <p>The conservatives relented, agreeing to support legislation that would permit foreign family planning agencies that perform abortions to continue receiving Federal aid. But money would be banned for groups that lobby for abortion.</p>
        <p>''It was a hard pill for those of us on the pro-life side of the issue to swallow,'' said Representative Steve Largent, Republican of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>In return for the restrictions on abortion, the House would immediately take up the Clinton Administration's requests to pay the back dues owed by the United States to the United Nations, reorganize the State Department and create a special loan program for the International Monetary Fund.</p>
        <p>But the President, who had rejected a similar abortion deal in exchange for votes on expanded trade authority, did not bite, so the Republicans held the foreign relations proposals hostage.</p>
        <p>Outraged, Mr. Clinton and his Cabinet publicly denounced the move every chance they could, coming as it did amid international turmoil. Republicans, they made plain, had undermined the United States' credibility as the nation wrangled with Iraq and worked to soothe Asian financial markets.</p>
        <p>The doomsday warnings, however, failed to fluster the conservatives, who think they are overblown.</p>
        <p>''I didn't believe them then, and I still don't believe that's the case,'' Mr. Largent said.</p>
        <p>Now, with this session a fading memory, Mr. Smith and his colleagues are preparing for next year's showdown. They know they will face an uncomfortable situation with Mr. Helms, who brokered the plan to reorganize the State Department and then watched it fall apart. But, bolstered as they are by the leadership's pledge of support, they say they will continue to entwine the same three foreign policy issues with the abortion language.</p>
        <p>''There will be linkage to the three in perpetuity,'' Mr. Smith said. ''This is our position. It's not going to change.''</p>
