        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Saddam Hussein is an autocrat. He rules Iraq with an iron fist. There is not much by way of human rights in Iraq. He invaded Kuwait. He thumbs his nose at the United Nations. He probably has chemical weapons and is almost certainly attempting to get nuclear weapons. There is no sign of democracy in Iraq's future. Thomas L. Friedman (column, Nov. 6) says if the United States has to strike military facilities again, it ''must try to destroy him too.''</p>

        <p>Jiang Zemin is an autocrat. He rules China with the iron fist of the Communist Party. There is not much by way of human rights in China.  China invaded Tibet. China can veto any United Nations resolution. It certainly has nuclear weapons. There is no sign of democracy in China's future, although the economy is reasonably free. Jiang Zemin gets to have lunch with the President of the United States and address Harvard students. Go figure.</p>
