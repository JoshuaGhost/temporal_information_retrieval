        <p>IN 1947, so the story goes, Tessie Four Times, a doting grandmother on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in Brockton, Mont., expressed pride in her grandson's basketball playing by wiping the sweat from his back with a shawl and then casting it onto the gym floor.</p>
        <p>Though she didn't know it then, her small, loving gesture was the origin of the basketball star quilt, now a much-anticipated ritual at reservation high schools. Each basketball season, Sioux and Assiniboine mothers and grandmothers stitch basketballs into their quilts to honor the players' coming of age and the passage of life.</p>
        <p>In this era of the Air Jordan XIII, the spectacle of kaleidoscopic star quilts hanging from gym walls -- reverently sewn gifts to players' families and coaches -- is surprising indeed. (Nike, meet Brockton.) It speaks to the distinctive ceremonial role, little known by outsiders, that quilts play in Native American communities.</p>
        <p>Unlike basketry, pottery and other hallmarks of Native American design, quilting has long been a ''hidden art form,'' said Marsha L. MacDowell, the folk-arts curator at the Michigan State University Museum and a curator of ''To Honor and Comfort: Native Quilting Traditions,'' an exhibition that runs through Jan. 4 at the National Museum of the American Indian's George Gustav Heye Center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The 40 or so quilts on display are testimonies to the spiritual dimension that can imbue cloth and thread. They also challenge stereotypes of just what ''Native American craft'' should be. Few scholars, collectors or even tourists have paid much attention to Native American quilts, Ms. MacDowell noted, in part because they have been deemed ''too European,'' and therefore, as a Waccamaw-Sioux quilter, Brenda Moore, puts it, not ''an Indian thing.'' But Indians are now putting their distinctive spin on quilt design.</p>
        <p>Though Native American textile production is ancient, quilting itself was introduced relatively recently by 19th-century missionaries.</p>
        <p>The rich, ceremonial life of quilts in native communities carries them beyond the simple utilitarian object and gives them special resonance. Simply put, quilts are an intimate part of birth and death.</p>
        <p>''To me, quilting is natural,'' said Lula Red Cloud, an Oglala Sioux quilter from the Pine Ridge Reservation in Hermosa, S.D., whose quilts are among those in the museum show. She specializes in star quilts, which have taken the place of traditional robes made from painted buffalo hide. ''It's the artistic way of making things, a cloth on which to transfer our thoughts, ideas and feelings,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So personal an expression is the Indian quilt that women prefer to  work alone rather than in groups. ''It's like meditation -- and chatter is distracting,'' Ms. Red Cloud said.</p>
        <p>Among the Lakota Sioux, quilts are traditionally used to wrap babies' cradle boards and are draped across the coffin when someone dies. According to Lakota legend, beaded moccasins were thrown into the grave to assist the departed on their journey down the ''spirit road'' to the Milky Way. Today, it's the star quilt.</p>
        <p>Among the Hopi, quilts mark the beginning of life. Upon the birth of a baby, infant and mother spend 20 days together in seclusion; then, before dawn on the final morning, female family members, each bearing a quilt, gather together at home for a baby-naming ceremony. They wash and bless the child, say prayers and then the paternal grandmother wraps the infant with a quilt. If many women are present, the baby almost disappears under a mountain of quilts, before being carried to the eastern edge of the village to greet the rising sun.</p>
        <p>At springtime on Nelson Island, about 600 miles east of Anchorage on the Bering Sea, coastal Yupik women, in a rough equivalent of a Tupperware party, celebrate their husband's first bearded seal catch of the season by giving away to other village women strips of cloth, along with store-bought goods. The cloth will reappear at wintertime dances as finished patchwork quilts.</p>
        <p>Because they are so ingrained in everyday life and have not been widely marketed to outsiders, quilts have until recently been taken for granted in native communities. But there are signs they are becoming iconic -- from the Brockton gym quilts to quilt symbols on powwow posters, T-shirts and baseball caps. Jill Hemming, a folklorist who has studied quilting among the Waccamaw-Sioux, observes that Native Americans have begun to embrace quilting, dispensing with ''romantic cliches'' of what's Indian.</p>
        <p>Of course, quilting as a phenomenon transcends ethnic and geographic boundaries -- and sometimes combines them. In 23 years of documenting quilts in Michigan and elsewhere, Prof. MacDowell and her husband, Kurt Dewhurst, the director of the Michigan State University Museum, discovered historic Odawa quilts, which combine European applique techniques learned from missionary wives with floral designs clearly inspired by their own distinctive Woodlands Indian beadwork.</p>
        <p>Today many Native American quilters are reconfiguring traditional motifs, turning log cabins into arrowheads or incorporating Hopi cornstalks into Irish chain quilts.</p>
        <p>Caroline Wilson, a Navajo, makes quilts that mirror 19th-century geometric Navajo ''chief'' blankets. Margaret Wood, whose background is Navajo and Seminole, merges her identities by blending Seminole patchwork and Navajo designs. She  spices her quilts by adapting decoration from Blackfeet Indian boys' shirts and Mimbres pottery.</p>
        <p>Traditional motifs can have special significance. The star, for instance, used in Amish and German-American quilts, symbolizes the morning star rising, or new life. Many quilts are deeply rooted in a sense of place. The quilts of Harriet Soong of Waimea, Hawaii, are predominantly white and green, because ''it rains all the time,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''We were always wet, and so it was always green,'' she continued.</p>
        <p>Like their non-native counterparts, many Native American quilters are breaking with tradition, creating quilts that are more like paintings, complete with art's social and political messages. Sheree Bonaparte, known as Peachy, a 41-year-old Akwesasne from Cornwall Island, Ontario, has made two ''Tree of Peace'' quilts. They reflect strife on the St. Regis-Akwesasne Reservation in 1990 in which a dispute over whether to allow casino gambling led to indiscriminate gunfire and the deaths of two people. While working, she frequently heard gunfire on the St. Lawrence River.</p>
        <p>Beneath the traditional tree of peace, she stitched two war clubs and an AK-47. ''I was real nervous about doing it,'' she said. ''It was almost sacrilegious to mess with a traditional symbol. My heart raced while I stitched. To calm down, I stitched in the three sisters -- corn, beans and squash -- at the base of the tree. They are the sustainers of life for our people.'' She describes the quilt as a ''healing process.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bonaparte, who is pregnant with her 10th child, gathered at the museum in Manhattan one evening recently with some of her quilting cohorts. A sense of kinship enveloped the room. ''How's your baby?'' asked Gussie Bento, a quilter from Hawaii.</p>
        <p>''I'm having another one,'' said Ms. Bonaparte.</p>
        <p>''What do you do for sore fingers?'' a novice asked Ms. Red Cloud.</p>
        <p>''I never use thimbles. Try a Band-Aid,'' she replied.</p>
        <p>For these women, a quilt's power to embody the emotions is its enduring gift. Ollie Napesni, an 80-year-old Sioux quilter from St. Francis, S.D., stood beside a quilt panel she made to remember her grandson, who died four years ago at age 30.</p>
        <p>In the quilt, she explained, a figure representing herself sits facing the horizon at the place where her grandson is buried, ''a beautiful place with wild turkeys and prairie dogs and pine trees all around, a good place to rest.''</p>
        <p>For a long time after his death, she said, she couldn't quilt. But a year later, in keeping with Sioux tradition, a ceremony was planned to honor her grandson's memory.</p>
        <p>''I got up at 4 in the morning and quilted, sewing and sewing and sewing, tears in my eyes,'' she recalled. ''Some of those tears are on the quilts I made.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday at the National Museum of the American Indian, a family quilting day will be held from noon to 4 P.M., including demonstrations by Native American quilters. The museum is in the Custom House at 1 Bowling Green (State Street and Broadway). For information: (212) 514-3714.</p>
