        <p>When he came into the courtroom, he looked like what he might have been if his life had not taken a turn: a genial math professor, slightly oblivious to fashion.</p>
        <p>On the first day of jury selection for his trial, Theodore J. Kaczynski, the man prosecutors say was the notorious Unabomber, settled gently into a seat between two lawyers today. He wore a tweedy tan jacket with black pants and no tie. He leaned back in his chair, as though class were about to begin, and chatted amiably with his lawyers. Sometimes, as the lawyers worked, he seemed to be smiling under his graying beard.</p>
        <p>But it quickly became clear from the questions the lawyers put to potential jurors that this is a fight for his life. Time and again, both sides pressed potential jurors about their views on the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaczynski faces charges here in four bomb attacks and could be sentenced to death if convicted in one, the fatal bombing of a forest industry official in 1995, which occurred after the Federal death penalty statute took effect.</p>
        <p>While they questioned jurors in the courtroom, defense lawyers filed legal papers setting out more clearly their claim that Mr. Kaczynski suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and explaining why he refused to be examined by proseuction psychiatrists. His condition is so extreme, a defense psychiatrist, Dr. David Foster, said in the papers, that Mr. Kaczynski believes he is ''controlled by an omnipotent organization'' against which he is powerless, according to The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Dr. Foster said Mr. Kaczynski is afraid of, among others, psychiatrists. The papers were in response to an effort by prosecutors to bar defense lawyers from asserting that he suffers from a mental defect and thus could not form the intent necessary to be held criminally responsible.</p>
        <p>There was no discussion of mental illness as the lawyers took turns exploring potential jurors' attitudes about the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Quin Denvir, a defense lawyer, pressed one potential juror because the man indicated on a jury questionnaire that he might favor the death penalty for someone who ''deliberately murders two or more people.'' Mr. Kaczynski, the prosecutors say, killed three and injured more than two dozen others in a string of 16 bomb attacks over 18 years. In addition to the attacks for which he is charged here, Mr. Kacznyski faces a separate trial for a fatal bombing of an advertising executive in North Caldwell, N.J., in 1994.</p>
        <p>Later, one of the prosecutors, R. Steven Lapham, asked the same man, ''Would you feel the death penalty is only appropriate in extreme types of cases like where there had been a torture murder?'' Mr. Kaczynski is charged with mailing and placing bombs that maimed and killed, but he is not known to have ever been present when the devices exploded. The potential juror said he could view each case on its merits, and he was not dismissed.</p>
        <p>For both sides, the early focus on the death penalty verified what many legal analysts had said about the case. With such an unusually large amount of material pointing to Mr. Kaczynski, they said, the trial was shaping up not as a ''Who done it?' but as a ''What to do about it?''</p>
        <p>One potential juror seemed to summarize the dilemma for the defense, which must contend with a colossal volume of pre-trial publicity that seemed to tie Mr. Kaczynski to the bombings.</p>
        <p>Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. of Federal District Court asked one man if he had any preconceived opinions about whether Mr. Kaczynski was guilty.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of hard not to have,'' the man replied.</p>
        <p>Judge Burrell asked what those opinions were, and the man said, ''I feel that he's guilty.'' The man was later excused.</p>
        <p>Judge Burrell ruled earlier, over the objection of news organizations, that jurors would remain anonymous, in part to protect their privacy. Today's proceedings were just the first step in a jury selection process that could take a month or more. After questioning, jurors who were not excused were placed on a list that will be reviewed by the lawyers and the judge on Friday.</p>
        <p>Those who are not dismissed at the end of each week will make it to a larger panel of 64 from which the final panel of 12 will be selected.</p>
        <p>After years of publicity, mystery and tragedy, the start of Mr. Kaczynski's trial was so sedate that it seemed anticlimactic. Inside the paneled courtroom, reporters were directed to place their press passes in their pockets so the potential jurors could not easily tell they were the subjects of widespread scrutiny.</p>
        <p>There was a hush in the room. Federal marshals, mostly in plain clothes, took seats in the spectator section, which made them seem so unobtrusive that the case could have been any run-of-the mill trial.</p>
        <p>There were no outbursts. The widow of Gilbert Murray, the president of the California Forestry Association who was killed by a bomb in 1995, made no noise as she wiped a tear away in a second-row seat.</p>
        <p>In a parking lot across the street from the Federal Courthouse, white tents serve as the temporary headquarters of television crews that circle the court. Court officials have given credentials to about 900 reporters from all over the country.</p>
        <p>But there are no television cameras in the courtroom. So on the first day of jury selection, it seemed almost as though there were two separate trials: the quiet one in the courtroom and one being described boisterously outside by reporters. At the center of them both is the same man who once fled the life of a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, a two-hour drive, but a very long way, from where he is now.</p>
