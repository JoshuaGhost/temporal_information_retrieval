        <p>This was not out of vanity, just necessity. Larry Johnson had been looking at himself over the last week, trying to find the flaws that were ruining the slick appearance he had at the start of the season.</p>
        <p>He had sprung out of the box so well, scoring forcefully in the Knicks' season-opener against Charlotte. His opening night had him talking about being an All-Star again, about being a leader for the Knicks. He was loud and proud, but then his self-confidence slipped as his shot fell flat. He blamed himself a little more every day as his esteem took a dive with his shooting percentage after averaging 7 points a night in the Knicks' last five games leading up to tonight.</p>

        <p>This was not out of vanity, just necessity. Larry Johnson had been looking at himself over the last week, trying to find the flaws that were ruining the slick appearance he had at the start of the season.</p>
        <p>He had sprung out of the box so well, scoring forcefully in the Knicks' season-opener against Charlotte. His opening night had him talking about being an All-Star again, about being a leader for the Knicks. He was loud and proud, but then his self-confidence slipped as his shot fell flat. He blamed himself a little more every day as his esteem took a dive with his shooting percentage after averaging 7 points a night in the Knicks' last five games leading up to tonight.</p>
        <p>But tonight was different. Johnson picked himself up, dusted off his game and started all over again. In doing so, he rediscovered his best side. Johnson scored a season-high 27 points as the surprisingly fresh Knicks remembered how to win easily by defeating the Raptors, 93-70, at the Skydome.</p>
        <p>''I think sometimes Larry doesn't have as much confidence in himself as we do in him,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''He can play aggressive and score. He's Larry Johnson. He's not some average player.''</p>
        <p>With all of Johnson's credentials, he has shown a tendency to be too unselfish and too willing to slip into the Knicks' background. His coach has noticed, his teammates have noticed, and so has Johnson.</p>
        <p>''My teammates have been great,'' said Johnson, who was 12 of 20 from the field. ''They know I've been struggling with my game. They've been telling me, 'Hey, L. J., just keep going and taking shots and don't worry about anybody else.' They helped me. And I was able to step forward tonight. But it can't be just one night. I can't continue to have one good game and six bad ones.''</p>
        <p>Johnson is searching for the same thing as the unpredictable Knicks: consistency. It is hard to decipher the mood swings of the Knicks (5-3). They are a team that is either contending or surrendering. Tonight, they looked like the former.</p>
        <p>They were a complete unit, unflustered by the pressing, trapping and irritating Raptors. Not even an incident involving point guard Chris Childs could put a damper on the 13-point lead the Knicks were riding in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>Childs picked up a technical foul with 9 minutes 6 seconds left in the first half, then committed another foul with 8:34 remaining. Thirty seconds later, a dismayed Childs was whistled for a third foul by Referee Steve Javie. Childs cast an inflammatory remark toward Javie, drawing another technical and an ejection.</p>
        <p>''We all need to learn from that,'' said Charlie Ward, who ran the team ably after Childs exited. ''You can't speak that way to anyone, not to come down on Chris.''</p>
        <p>With Childs gone, it was up to Ward to contain the Raptors' dangerous Damon Stoudamire. Ward flew in his face when he tried to shoot a jumper, and stepped in Stoudamire's path to block any layups. ''I think he was just off,'' said Ward, who had nine assists. ''You're just out there trying to do your best.''</p>
        <p>Ward put a lid on Stoudamire, who shot 5 of 13 for 10 points. ''The Knicks beat us so bad tonight that this is one of those losses that doesn't even bother me,'' Stoudamire said. ''We really never had a chance after the first quarter.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks were ahead, 26-19, at that point and maintained their energy, despite arriving in town after a laborious victory against Denver the night before. It was never close. And that meant Patrick Ewing (17 points) could get some rest. He played just 24 minutes. ''We jumped on them early,'' Ewing said. ''We did a good job from the outset.''</p>
        <p>So why can't the Knicks do this every night? ''I really don't have any idea,'' Ewing said. ''It's the league. It happens. This is all about winning games. And we're only going to get better.''</p>
        <p>That progress will be measured in consistency. Tonight, they were unpredictable in the most positive of ways. ''We were energetic, but more importantly, we were efficient,'' Van Gundy said. ''We've had three 20-plus-point wins, but it's the close ones that we struggle with.''</p>
        <p>In the close ones, Johnson has been in the background. His reappearance tonight helped make the difference. ''I got to missing my shot, and then I started hesitating,'' Johnson said. ''I can't do that. I've got to be aggressive all the time.''</p>
