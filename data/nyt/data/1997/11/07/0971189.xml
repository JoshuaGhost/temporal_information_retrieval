      <abstract>
        <p>Judge James Ware asks Pres Clinton to withdraw his nomination to become only active black judge on US Appeal Court for Ninth Circuit, confessing that he has lied for years in claiming that his teenage brother, Virgil, was killed in racist shooting in Alabama in 1963; 51-year-old Ware has claimed that tragedy inspired his legal career, which led to Pres Bush's appointment of him to Federal court in San Jose, Calif; Birmingham News has now published articles about different Ware family that suffered tragedy of Virgil's murder in 1963, on same day that four black girls were killed in Ku Klux Klan bombing; Virgil's real surviving brother, also named James, wonders that anyone could try to prosper from event; White House, Senate Judiciary Committee and Justice Department are all stunned by revelation, since FBI check did not uncover discrepancies in shooting story that Judge Ware has repeated in interviews and at judicial conferences (M)</p>

        <p>It was, as James Ware told it, the tragedy that made him ''hungry for justice'': the murder of his teen-age brother, Virgil, in a racist shooting in Birmingham, Ala. at the height of the civil rights struggle in 1963. That moment inspired Mr. Ware to earn a law degree at Stanford University and, eventually, an appointment from George Bush as a Federal District Court judge in San Jose, Calif.</p>
        <p>The tragedy happened, all right, but not to Judge Ware or his family. Today, the judge confessed that his account was ''not the truth,'' and asked President Clinton to withdraw his nomination to become the only active black judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>It was, as James Ware told it, the tragedy that made him ''hungry for justice'': the murder of his teen-age brother, Virgil, in a racist shooting in Birmingham, Ala. at the height of the civil rights struggle in 1963. That moment inspired Mr. Ware to earn a law degree at Stanford University and, eventually, an appointment from George Bush as a Federal District Court judge in San Jose, Calif.</p>
        <p>The tragedy happened, all right, but not to Judge Ware or his family. Today, the judge confessed that his account was ''not the truth,'' and asked President Clinton to withdraw his nomination to become the only active black judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''I am sorry that my misstatements about my background have caused such unintended consequences,'' Judge Ware, 51, said in a letter faxed to the President. ''I am deeply committed to the cause of civil rights and do not wish to be seen, as is being suggested, as using the unfortunate tragedy which befell Virgil Ware as trying to better myself at someone else's expense.''</p>
        <p>Judge's Ware's withdrawal came after The Birmingham News published an article today reporting that the real family of Virgil Lamar Ware, including the dead man's brother, also named James, a worker for a coke-processing company in Birmingham, disputed the judge's claims.</p>
        <p>An earlier article in the newspaper, in August, detailed the story of the Ware family and its three decades of grief since two white teen-agers shot 13-year-old Virgil off the handlebars of a bicycle pedaled by James on Sept. 15, 1963, the same day that four little black girls were killed in the Ku Klux Klan bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church across town.</p>
        <p>''Why would he do something like that?'' the other James Ware, now 50, asked quietly in a telephone interview from Birmingham. ''I have no idea. I'd like to talk to him, and ask him why. I didn't think it was true. I couldn't picture a man being that hard up, doing that. You see stuff like that in pictures, but you never think of things like that in real life. It's bad enough what happened, then to have somebody else trying to prosper from it.''</p>
        <p>Judge Ware, who recalled being so disgusted at the Democratic Party's control of the Jim Crow South that he became a Republican in protest, had provoked no noticeable debate when President Clinton nominated him for promotion in June.</p>
        <p>White House and Administration officials, and staff members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which held a hearing on Judge Ware's nomination last week, were equally stunned by his admission. A full-field background investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation failed to disclose the discrepancies in the judge's story, which he had told over and over at judicial conferences and in newspaper interviews since President Bush appointed him to the Federal bench in 1990.</p>
        <p>''His admission did come as a surprise to us,'' said a Justice Department spokesman, Michael Gordon.</p>
        <p>A senior Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the purpose of an F.B.I. background check was to ''search for instances of wrongdoing and lawbreaking, and not to fact-check every anecdote at a dinner party.''</p>
        <p>He said he did not know whether investigators were aware of Judge Ware's repeated telling of the shooting story, but said that since the other Wares themselves had only recently raised questions about it, ''I don't see how anybody could have been expected to know'' or to question the veracity of a sitting Federal judge.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and Senate aides said that when they first learned of the possible discrepancy on Wednesday and questioned Judge Ware about it, he gave evasive, indirect answers. Before withdrawing his nomination today, Judge Ware issued an elaborate statement to The Associated Press, trying to explain his connection to the case.</p>
        <p>''I did live in Birmingham at the time of the event,'' he said. ''My father had told me he had a son about my age with another woman whose name was James. At one time he told me she had another child named Virge. He told me that we were related to other Wares in Birmingham. I did suffer the death of a sister by shooting at about this same time. I used my tenuous connection with the Wares and and my own feeling of loss as a basis for making a speech about Virgil Ware's death.''</p>
        <p>In recent years, he has held audiences at judicial conferences spellbound with his account of the shooting.</p>
        <p>Last year, the judge told The San Francisco Chronicle that the shooting had ''molded me into a person who was hungry for justice.''</p>
        <p>Such recollections made strong impressions on Judge Ware's listeners. Christine Burdick, executive director of the Santa Clara Bar Association, said today that she first saw Judge Ware in 1992 and he told the story of the shooting. She said the speech ''was about lawyering for the right reasons.''</p>
        <p>Far away in Alabama, the other James Ware, has struggled with his own questions for years: How the white teen-ager who admitted killing his brother could have been charged with murder, convicted of manslaughter, sentenced to seven months in prison but released on probation in less time than that.</p>
        <p>Now he has a new question.</p>
        <p>''If he just called me and said, ''Mr. Ware, I'd like to apologize for what I done,''' James Ware said. ''But they say he's keeping a low profile. Why'd he do this, unless he was trying to gain? Like I said, he was already on his way up.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 8, 1997, Saturday</p>
        <p>An article yesterday about a California judge's withdrawal of his nomination for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, referred incorrectly in some copies to the California Governor who appointed him to the State Superior Court in 1988. It was George Deukmejian, not Pete Wilson.</p>
