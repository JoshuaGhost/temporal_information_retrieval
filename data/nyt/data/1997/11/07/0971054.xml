        <p>THEODORE-Ion. The Horace Mann School community expresses deep sorrow at the death of its beloved former Head of the Arts Department. He was a multitalented man-sculptor, athlete, philosopher, historian, thespian, naturalist-above all, he was a gentleman and a gentle man, a teacher and colleague who imparted as his lasting legacy a love of truth and art. We are indeed diminished by his loss. Michael D. Hess, HM '58 Chairman, Board of Trustees</p>
