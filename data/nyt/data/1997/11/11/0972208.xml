        <p>Svidler, three times Russian champion in the last four years, is 21 years old and had never met Kasparov over the board before. But he did not give any indications of being awestruck, offering a gambit early in the play and following it up with an excellent performance.</p>
        <p>Against the Sicilian Defense, 3 c3 does not open the game as 3 d4 cd 4 Nd4 does, but it is not harmless either. After 3 . . . Nf6 4 Be2 Nbd7 (4  . . . Ne4? 5 Qa4) 5 d3 b6 O-O Bb7 7 Nbd2 g6, Svidler ventured a rarely tried gambit with 8 d4!?</p>
        <p>After 11 Ng5, it would have been weak to play 11 . . . Bd5?! because 12 Bf3 Bf3 13 Qf3 Nf6 (13 . . . f6? 14 Ne6 Qc8 15 Qa8! Qa8 16 Nc7 wins rook for knight) 14 Qc6! Nd7 15 Re1! e6 16 Ne6! fe 17 Re6 Kf7 18 Qd5 Kg7 19 Bg5 Qb8 20 Rae1 Rg8 21 Re7! Be7 22 Re7 Kh8 23 Qf7 Nf8 24 Bf6 wins. And defense by 12 . . . e6 is crushed by 13 Bd5 ed 14 Qf3 Qf6 15 Qd5 Rb8 16 Re1 Be7 17 Ne4! Qg7 18 Nd6.</p>
        <p>On 14 g4, Kasparov did not want to submit to 14 . . . Be6 15 Re1 O-O 17 Re6 fe 18 Ne6 Qc8 19 Nf8 Nf8 20 Be3 with a superior two-bishop game for White. But this may have been the best he could get.</p>
        <p>His alternative, 14 . . . h6 15 gf hg 16 fg gave back a pawn, but after 16 . . . a6 17 gf Kf7, Svidler could not well go for another with 18 Bc6? because 18  . . . Qc7! 19 Qc2 Bd4 20 Kh1 e6 21 Ba4 Nc5 turns the tables. Still, after 18 Ba4, he kept the superior position</p>
        <p>After 23 . . . R8h4, Svidler continued to ignore the en prise g5 pawn because 24 Bg5 Bh6 25 Bh6 Rh6 would let Black get a grip on the kingside dark squares. After 24 Bc2!, with Svidler winding up for 25 Bg5, Kasparov tried to make a go of it by giving up rook for bishop with 24 . . . Nh5 25 Bf5 Nf4 26 Bh3 Nh3. But on 27 Kh1 Qf6 28 Rg3 Qf5 29 Bg5 Ng5 30 Rg5 Qh3 31 Rg2, he was lost.</p>
        <p>After 34 Qe8, Kasparov could have dragged things on with 34 . . . Kd6, but after 34 . . . Rc4 35 Qd8, the black king was in an awful situation. On 35  . . . Qf5 36 Re1 Be5 (or 36 . . . Kf7 37 Qg8 mate) 37 Qb8!, there was no point in 37 . . . Kf6 38 Qh8 Ke6 39 Re5! Qe5 40 Rg6, which wins the black queen. Kasparov gave up.</p>
