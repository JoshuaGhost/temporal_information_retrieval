        <p>THE library of Dr. Sherwin Nuland begs for readers and ruminators. Scented faintly with cherry wood, the room rests off a second-floor landing in a Colonial-style house designed in 1929 by Alice Washburn, an eminent Connecticut architect. The library, preserved in its original state, is classical and disciplined, lined with old and new literature, a reading desk and chair.</p>
        <p>But the focus is Dr. Nuland's collection of exquisitely bound facsimiles documenting the history of medicine, whose authors range from Paraclesus to the surgeon Harvey Cushing. Dr. Nuland is himself an author  and the winner of the 1994 National Book Award for his work entitled ''How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter.'' Most recently published is his work called ''The Wisdom of the Body.''</p>
        <p>Both books, published by Knopf, are replete with axioms from the old philosophers, many of whom were surgeons like himself. Like some of his predecessors, Dr. Nuland writes to teach the untutored reader about the theory and practice of medicine and its contemporary quandaries,  weaving in richly detailed case histories and stories from his life.</p>
        <p>While his writings serve to instruct, he has also become one of medicine's most ardent critics. In recent essays and editorials, he has admonished the medical profession for its over-reliance on technology and its bottom-line practices, which he says are eroding the ancient art of healing and encouraging doctors to become masters ''of detached observation.''</p>
        <p>''What I see more and more are physicians doing what is safest, not necessarily what is best in the long run,'' he said in a recent interview at his home in Hamden. ''Yet good medicine depends upon a physician's ability to make judgments based on years of experience.''</p>
        <p>To accentuate his point he quotes Hippocrates: ''Life is short and the Art long, the occasion fleeting, experience fallacious and judgment difficult.''</p>
        <p>''In other words,'' he continued, ''judgment is everything.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Nuland, a clinical professor of surgery at Yale University, has not practiced medicine since 1992, enjoying instead the transformation to writer. He works in a spacious room across the hall from his library, where ceiling-high bookcases hold copies of his six books including ''How We Die,'' which has been translated into 17 languages, and mementos from the 40 years he spent at Yale-New Haven Hospital, as a medical student, resident and surgeon. The bronze sculpture and medal he received after winning the book award rest on his mantle.</p>
        <p>At the age of 68, he has the clear eyes and unlined skin of someone far younger. His manner is sanguine, and his diction is brimming with literary flourishes. When he begins a book, he said, he never outlines but instead relies on his emotions and instincts. While working on ''The Wisdom of the Body,'' a book exploring the resilience of the human body and its ability to recover and heal itself, he jotted down random notes in a three-ring notebook before sitting down to compose the text.</p>
        <p>''One day I went for a walk and thought about Shelley and the concept of moral imagination and I wrote that down,'' he said as he leafed through the notebook. ''Then I started thinking about the specialization of the cells and the function of the blood and jotted that down. By the time I was ready to write I had 216 notes to myself.''</p>
        <p>The result is a dozen chapters with subjects ranging from cell biology, exemplified by a patient with sickle-cell anemia, to coronary artery disease told through the case of a man who undergoes open-heart surgery, and the lymph system, made palpable by a description of a pregnant woman who learns she has breast cancer. In each scenario, the outcome is successful. ''Writing is a process of unloading my subconscious mind onto paper,'' he continued. ''I trust my emotions more than words. If I'm writing about something that evokes my feelings I let myself feel.''</p>
        <p>In ''How We Die,'' Dr. Nuland said he was searching for a philosophy of death, a recurrent theme of his childhood. He was born in the Bronx, grew up in a four-room apartment with his immigrant parents, grandmother, aunt and older brother. Another brother had died three years before he was born, and his grandfather and two uncles died of tuberculosis not long after they arrived from Russia. When he was 11, his mother died of cancer. Later he witnessed the decline and death of his grandmother.</p>
        <p>''Death was a part of the whole legend of my family,'' Dr. Nuland said. ''The whole atmosphere was one of looming tragedy. One of my conscious motives for going into medicine was that by learning about medicine and encountering sickness I was ridding myself of being subjected to the way the lives of the people I loved were distorted by sickness. I never had a conscious fear of death, but I did have a conscious fear of sickness. By the time I completed medical school that fear was gone.''</p>
        <p>Though he mentions many of his family members in the book, Dr. Nuland never mentions his father, who died at the age of 69. He said he didn't realize the omission until after the book was published and a friend mentioned it to him.</p>
        <p>''I don't know why I never mentioned my father,'' he said. ''But I do know that I was raised around a lot of powerful women and that he wasn't the person who gave me my wings. He was very compartmentalized because of my older brother's death. He was an immigrant who couldn't write English and then this little golden son appears and they have him for three years. Then within a matter of 48 hours the child dies from an infectious disease. I've always thought that part of my father went to the grave with him.''</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that contact with death at an early age is one of the reasons why people go into medicine, Dr. Nuland said. ''Doctors have a greater fear of death than in any other profession. One of the reasons we deal so badly with end-of-life issues is because it brings back all of these primitive fears.''</p>
        <p>The situation is complicated by the fact that doctors are trained to save lives and when they lose a patient it can be devastating. ''I don't think I ever lost a patient when I didn't feel I should have done something more to save them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Because the subject of death can trigger inner fears, some doctors may also be reluctant to consider easing the suffering of patients whose deaths are imminent, he said. Though he questions the motives and tactics of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, he added, the debate over physician-assisted suicide Dr. Kevorkian has raised is helping to improve palliative care and change attitudes among doctors. Overall, Dr. Nuland said he feels strongly that the decision to euthanize is best made by doctors, the dying and their families, not legislators and the courts.</p>
        <p>Since the publication of ''How We Die,'' Dr. Nuland said he has received thousands of letters, many of them from doctors thanking him for writing a book about a topic so fraught with anxiety.</p>
        <p>In ''The Wisdom of the Body,'' Dr. Nuland took a more affirming approach to the human body by documenting its wonders and ability to overcome extraordinary threats to its integrity. The book has sold more than 50,000 copies and is being translated into 10 languages. Dr. Nuland said he was surprised by reactions to a portion of the epilogue in which he discusses his spiritual beliefs.</p>
        <p>''I believe in nothing supernatural,'' he said. ''And I had no idea how many people would be offended by that until I wrote that book.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Nuland said he has always maintained a vibrant spiritual life. ''I consider myself an observant agnostic, but there's an irony about it,'' he said. ''I was brought up a Jew and I love the ritual. It's home to me. I love the sense of family it has always given me. I love the prayers and the sense of the sanctuary. The mere fact that I don't believe in God doesn't mean that I don't believe in the power of that belief.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Nuland's second wife, Sarah Nuland, is an actress and runs an education program at Long Wharf Theater in New Haven. The couple have been married 21 years and have two teen-age children, Will and Molly. He has two other children, from a previous marriage: Toria, who works for the State Department and Drew, a managing director for Boccardi Martini Rossi in China.</p>
        <p>The night he won the National Book Award, he and his wife had attended the ceremony, which was held at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan. He did not prepare an acceptance speech. ''All that day I felt quite depressed,'' he recalled. ''I was convinced I was not going to get it. But when I heard my name announced I looked straight into my wife's eyes. I felt like I was levitating. I had to make up my acceptance speech as I walked to the podium.''</p>
        <p>After the ceremony, he said, he and his wife were standing outside the Plaza when he looked across Central Park South, toward the Hampshire House, and remembered he had worked there as an elevator operator in 1951. ''Here I was, this kid who had come from the Bronx,'' he said. ''Then all of these years later I'm standing outside the Plaza holding this sculpture and medal in my arms, honoring me for winning this major literary prize. I must say, it was quite a marvelous moment.''</p>
