        <p>ONE year ago Tuesday, secret tape recordings came to light of executives at Texaco Inc. speaking contemptuously about minority employees and planning the destruction of documents demanded in a discrimination lawsuit. Their comments set off a firestorm of protest, with civil rights leaders calling for a national boycott.</p>
        <p>Less than two weeks later, Texaco agreed to pay $140 million in the largest settlement ever of a racial discrimination case. And it promised to adopt a broad set of policies to promote equality and erase discrimination ''wherever it may be.''</p>
        <p>Today, the company prefers to call that troubling episode a ''catalyst for change.'' And Texaco has indeed made changes.</p>
        <p>It has bought more services from minority-owned companies and instructed its big suppliers to follow suit. It has set five-year goals -- not ''quotas,'' mind you -- to expand minority ranks at all levels. It has tied part of executives' bonuses to their success in meeting targets for hiring and promoting minorities in their departments and to their scores in employee surveys about the company's ''respect for the individual.''</p>
        <p>It also has enrolled its 20,000 employees in the United States in two-day ''diversity'' workshops. It has placed more advertising in black-oriented magazines. And it has paid $420,000 to be the lead sponsor of the Universoul Big Top Circus, billed as the nation's only circus owned by blacks.</p>
        <p>''I can tell you unequivocally that we've made substantial progress,'' Peter I. Bijur, the chairman and chief executive of Texaco, said in an interview last week at the company's headquarters in White Plains.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Texaco has kept busy with such initiatives, many of them reflecting American industry's consensus of the best practices in the racial arena. Yet Texaco's efforts have been greeted with considerable doubt -- about whether it has correctly diagnosed its problems, whether it is doing the right things and whether this company, or any company, can change its employees' racial attitudes.</p>
        <p>The story of Texaco has grown only more complex with time. The protest over the tapes last year demanded simple, concrete answers: How would the executives be punished? Would Texaco stand up to a national boycott? Or would it settle the lawsuit, which accused it of systematically denying minority employees promotions because of their race and fostering a racially hostile environment?</p>
        <p>Now, Texaco, the nation's 11th-largest company, is trotted out as Exhibit A to advance political agendas. Some civil rights leaders, for example, have used Texaco to test their leverage with other big corporations, and they want the company to do more. Their view is supported by the Texaco employees who filed the original lawsuit, who contend that they have experienced discrimination firsthand and who worry that any changes will be only cosmetic.</p>
        <p>Skeptics, however, say that Texaco is going overboard and wonder whether its focus on workplace diversity -- seemingly at odds with a country that has grown more hostile to affirmative action in its public institutions -- is doing more harm than good to race relations.</p>
        <p>Corporate America is closely watching the company for clues on how to deal with a new wave of litigation set off by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. That law allows employees who say they have been discriminated against to sue for back pay, compensatory and punitive damages and to demand a jury trial. Before, plaintiffs could sue only for lost wages, making it difficult to get lawyers to take up their cause.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of American industry's awkward embrace of the diversity agenda that this debate rages around a company that, for all its effort, does not concede that anything was wrong with its policies or practices.</p>
        <p>''I do not admit, nor do I accept the fact that the programs that we had in place were flawed in any way,'' Mr. Bijur said in the interview. ''We are a microcosm of society. We are 30,000 people, and those people have attitudes. And sometimes those attitudes, which they develop throughout their lives, are brought into the workplace.''</p>
        <p>Goals, and Customers</p>
        <p>The Texaco tapes, copies of which had been obtained by the plaintiffs in the discrimination suit, caused an initial fury in part because it seemed that one executive had used the word ''niggers'' during a discussion of celebrations like Kwanzaa. A computer-enhanced analysis of the tapes showed that the epithet had not been used, but Mr. Bijur still declared the context and tone of the recorded conversations to be ''categorically unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>In the following days, documents emerged that were part of the lawsuit that appeared to show a pattern of discrimination in the hiring and promotion of minorities at Texaco, although the company disputed that such a pattern existed.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Bijur says that he has no illusions that Texaco is free of racial animosity. But he says Texaco can become a better company by setting quantitative goals for hiring and promoting blacks, as well as members of other minority groups, and by tracking progress in that area alongside profit and productivity goals.</p>
        <p>Texaco wants to raise its percentage of minority employees from 22 percent last year to 29 percent in 2000, a figure that would be one of the highest in the oil industry. It is planning to spend an average of $200 million a year over the next five years for services and supplies from minority-  and women-owned businesses, compared with $139 million in 1996.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bijur, who found himself under the media glare a year ago, only months after taking over as chairman, said he now welcomes the scrutiny and plans to publicize the company's progress.</p>
        <p>And he maintains that the events of last November simply accelerated plans to diversify Texaco's work force.</p>
        <p>''You have to turn what could be a disastrous situation into the best opportunity you can, which is what I tried to do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He would like to be able to snap his fingers and instantly meet his long-range goals in areas like the ranks of top executives, but he said the process could not be rushed.</p>
        <p>''Sure, I can go out and hire people in order to make numbers work,'' he added. ''I'm not about to do that.''</p>
        <p>Among the company's 19 corporate officers, there are now three women and no members of minority groups. Last fall, there was one woman; the remainder were white men. The company also added a second black director this year.</p>
        <p>On a broader scale, figures provided by Texaco show that of the 355 executives who are eligible for bonuses, 25, or 7 percent, are members of minority groups, an addition of 4 over the past year.</p>
        <p>Texaco had long been a laggard in an industry that has historically followed, not led, efforts to diversify its work force. The company has focused more during this decade on recruiting minority executives, but it has often had to be prodded.</p>
        <p>In 1990, the Labor Department found that Texaco was deficient in its minority-group representation at some levels. As recently as last year, before the tapes came out, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued a finding that Texaco had not promoted blacks in certain employee groups because of their race.</p>
        <p>Of course, Texaco's new diversity program is aimed at more than just changing the makeup of its work force. Mr. Bijur hopes it will also be good for business. After all, he says, his job is to sell more gasoline and oil, and he wants to ''attract a wide section of customers.''</p>
        <p>Diversity's Divisions</p>
        <p>What you do about a problem depends upon what you diagnose the problem to be. And some critics say Texaco's assessment is muddled at best, ill considered at worst.</p>
        <p>Shelby Steele, a conservative black author and research fellow at the Hoover Institution, said he thought Texaco's efforts to improve diversity were ''indiscriminate wallpapering'' and ''icons of racial good will.'' If the original problem was discriminatory behavior, Mr. Steele added, then Texaco should be teaching employees what constitutes discrimination, rather than touting diversity and cultural sensitivity.</p>
        <p>''Is this the kind of thing that is going to make race relations more genuine and open?'' Mr. Steele asked. ''My sense is it's going to divide them. If you want to make people self-conscious and drive them back into their own groups, then bring in a diversity trainer.''</p>
        <p>He said truth would have been better served if the original discrimination lawsuit had been fully adjudicated. Because Texaco settled it instead, while admitting no wrongdoing, its new programs appear disingenuous and intended primarily to cover vulnerabilities, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steele is not alone in his criticism of diversity training. Frederick R. Lynch, a professor at Claremont McKenna College and the author of ''The Diversity Machine'' (Free Press, 1997), said he considered it noteworthy that some of the most racially charged conversations among Texaco executives that were caught on tape had to do with programs at Texaco intended to promote diversity.</p>
        <p>''It's possible that diversity training was contributing to an us-versus-them atmosphere,'' said Mr. Lynch, who is white.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch said a broad effort to promote diversity inevitably ''slides back down into the bramble bush of affirmative action.'' That can lead to stigmas and tensions in the workplace, institutionalized separatism and a slackening of diversity efforts once minimum targets are met, he said.</p>
        <p>''It undermines trust,'' he added. ''Texaco went overboard.''</p>
        <p>Not so, said Deval L. Patrick, the former head of the Justice Department's civil rights division, who  leads a task force set up as part of the lawsuit settlement to oversee Texaco's diversity efforts. In an interview, Mr. Patrick described the company's initiative so far as far-reaching and said senior executives' commitment to workplace fairness was ''palpable.''</p>
        <p>Even so, he worried that managers might not have enough time to carry out their new duties.</p>
        <p>''It's ultimately going to be a question of implementation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bijur does not share his concerns.</p>
        <p>''Some people are going to have to spend a lot more time, but that's O.K. with me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Corporate 'Smelling Salts'</p>
        <p>In a way, Texaco has become a testing ground for the push for civil rights in the private sector.</p>
        <p>Not only has the number of discrimination lawsuits soared over the last few years, but legal experts expect a wave of new ones. Cyrus Mehri, a lawyer based in Washington who represented Texaco employees in their suit, said that case prompted about 2,000 calls to his office from employees of companies around the country. So far, Mr. Mehri said, the calls have resulted in lawsuits against Sikorsky Aircraft and the Crown Central Petroleum Corporation.</p>
        <p>Predictably, the threat of such legal actions has been a boon to the consulting industry.</p>
        <p>''Texaco was like smelling salts for corporate America,'' said Mauricio Velasquez, president of the Diversity Training Group, a consulting company in Baltimore. ''It put a price tag on sweeping these problems under the rug.''</p>
        <p>Many companies have developed programs even more extensive than Texaco's. Bank of America, for example, has set up ''diversity business councils'' that develop programs or practices for individual business units. For example, its audit division linked up with an association of black accountants to help recruit employees. The bank also has a diversity network of volunteers, including white men, who organize anything from resume-writing workshops to holiday celebrations.</p>
        <p>Bank of America's chairman, David A. Coulter, holds his top 200 officers accountable for how well they promote diversity, a standard that contributed to the departure in the past year of several senior executives who failed to appreciate its importance, said Valerie Crane, an executive vice president who is in charge of the company's diversity program.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming a minimum job requirement,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Underscoring the shift of the affirmative action debate to the private from the public sector, the lawsuit against Texaco was settled in the same month that Californians voted to dismantle state-run affirmative action programs. And on Tuesday, residents of Houston will vote on whether to continue affirmative action programs in that city.</p>
        <p>Searching for more fertile ground, civil rights advocates have turned their attention to the corporate world. Texaco provided them with indisputable evidence, in their eyes, that discrimination in society was alive and that their mission was as important as ever. Now, they are determined to exploit their new-found influence both at Texaco and elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Why, they ask, does Texaco tie just 10 percent of executives' bonuses to their progress in meeting diversity goals if diversity is indeed the company's No. 1 priority? In an interview, Mr. Bijur said the percentage could be adjusted as needed to motivate or penalize individual managers.</p>
        <p>At the annual Texaco shareholders' meeting in May, the Rev. Jesse Jackson talked about the ''toxic atmosphere'' at Texaco and twice asked Mr. Bijur why the company had promoted an executive who was accused of discriminatory practices in the original lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''The charged are now in charge,'' Mr. Jackson said at the meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bijur did not address Mr. Jackson's questions at the meeting, but he said in the interview last week that the atmosphere at Texaco had never been ''toxic.'' He also said it was inappropriate and showed a lack of respect to bring up an individual's name in such a setting, adding that the company had found no support for the accusations against the executive.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Bijur said, Texaco has demonstrated that it has shown zero tolerance for discriminatory behavior by demoting or dismissing employees at all levels in the last year after complaints about their behavior were investigated.</p>
        <p>The hammer fell hardest on those whose voices were on the infamous tapes. Robert Ulrich, Texaco's treasurer at the time the tapes were made, was indicted on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice involving company documents crucial to the lawsuit. He had retired, and the company cut off as many of his benefits as it legally could. Richard A. Lundwall, who had been laid off from Texaco before he brought the tapes to light, was indicted with Mr. Ulrich on the same charges and has had his benefits cut off. Both Mr. Ulrich and Mr. Lundwall have pleaded not guilty. David Keough, the chief financial officer of Texaco's Heddington Insurance subsidiary, was dismissed.</p>
        <p>In the wake of the Texaco disclosures, Mr. Jackson opened an office of his Rainbow/PUSH Coalition on Wall Street to keep pressure on corporate managements.</p>
        <p>He plans to remain especially vigilant in his monitoring of Texaco. ''We must never leave this beachhead,'' he said. He also disputed Mr. Bijur's criticism of his performance at the shareholders' meeting.</p>
        <p>''He has to admit the atmosphere was toxic because it created the polluted environment out of which came the insulting words,'' Mr. Jackson said in an interview. As for the promotion of the executive who had been accused of discrimination, he said, ''It makes the workers question the sincerity of the changes.''</p>
        <p>'It's Still Early'</p>
        <p>Regardless of what Mr. Bijur may believe, some employees who thought Texaco was a racist company a year ago still think so. While Mr. Jackson and other civil rights leaders may see Texaco as a beachhead, to others it has been their only battle for several years.</p>
        <p>Beatrice Hester, who contended in the lawsuit that she had unfairly been passed over for promotions, has remained at her job over the last year as a business analyst in Texaco's Houston office. She said she had a sense among her co-workers that ''at this point, nothing has changed,'' except that some whites appear to be more resentful, and more cautious, in dealing with blacks.</p>
        <p>''I kind of feel like they just settled because their backs were against the wall,'' she said. ''But it's still early, and the window of opportunity is still open for them.''</p>
        <p>Sil Chambers, a lead plaintiff, said he would return to his old job at Texaco early next year as a senior financial analyst. Although he acknowledged that his presence might make many people uncomfortable, he said he felt a responsibility to many of his black colleagues.</p>
        <p>''They want to see me there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Since January, Mr. Chambers has been working full time as an administrator of his church in Harlem as part of Texaco's ''executive loan'' program, under which he is paid his full salary for doing community work.</p>
        <p>But he has kept in touch, and many of his former colleagues have told him that the company is changing in small steps. Many blacks, for example, are undergoing extensive interviews and getting guidance and counseling about their careers, he said.</p>
        <p>''Things have happened over the past six months that they've never seen at Texaco,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chambers, who is 43, said he believed that after about five years, managers throughout Texaco will recognize that diversity is good for business. And he plans to be around to see it happen. In fact, he said, he expects to retire from Texaco.</p>
        <p>Another lead plaintiff in the case, Bari-Ellen Roberts, has left the company and has no plans to return.</p>
        <p>The 1,350 plaintiffs in the class-action suit -- essentially, all the salaried blacks in the company -- received an average of $70,000 from the settlement. And as lead plaintiffs, Ms. Roberts and Mr. Chambers each received additional payments.</p>
        <p>Since leaving the company, Ms. Roberts has been speaking to groups about her experiences. And she says that many questions she has been asked -- who her role models were, for example -- are helping guide her as she writes a book, tentatively titled ''Roberts v. Texaco,'' which Avon plans to publish next year.</p>
        <p>''It's been very cathartic for me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While the book will inevitably talk about her bad experiences at Texaco, she hopes that it will be seen as an inspirational story -- ''a book,'' she said, ''that children will read.'' Which means the book on race at Texaco may remain open for a long time.</p>
