        <p>LET'S say you received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service saying that you failed to pay tax on some oil-company dividends and that you owe the Government $230. You responded with a letter saying that you have never owned that stock, but the I.R.S. keeps sending bills.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you own the stock and sent a check, but your I.R.S. account was never credited, or unfathomable interest or penalties were assessed. Phone calls haven't helped, and you throw up your hands. Can't someone among the 110,000 I.R.S. employees straighten out such simple mix-ups?  And can't they do so without protracted correspondence or telephone tag?</p>

        <p>LET'S say you received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service saying that you failed to pay tax on some oil-company dividends and that you owe the Government $230. You responded with a letter saying that you have never owned that stock, but the I.R.S. keeps sending bills.</p>
        <p>Or perhaps you own the stock and sent a check, but your I.R.S. account was never credited, or unfathomable interest or penalties were assessed. Phone calls haven't helped, and you throw up your hands. Can't someone among the 110,000 I.R.S. employees straighten out such simple mix-ups?  And can't they do so without protracted correspondence or telephone tag?</p>
        <p>The answer to these questions is generally yes, the I.R.S. says, at least if your case is  not too technical or too contentious.</p>
        <p>If you are not already the subject of a formal I.R.S. audit, and if you are just one of the hundreds of thousands of taxpayers who each year become mired in minor tax disputes that can cause emotional havoc far out of proportion to the money at stake, your friends at the I.R.S. are here to help you -- this month, in a city near you.</p>
        <p>Specifically, your salvation could lie with the agency's Taxpayer Advocate -- formerly called its ombudsman -- and his deputies in each district who administer the problem resolution program.</p>
        <p>Although this mechanism has long been in place and is used for 300,000 cases a year, it is seen by some as the agency's ''best-kept secret,'' said Lee R. Monks, the Taxpayer Advocate.</p>
        <p>This, however, seems certain to change. The I.R.S., responding to a stinging set of recent Senate hearings that disclosed abusive collection practices, said it would throw open its doors one Saturday a month so taxpayers with unresolved cases can meet face to face with agency officials in hopes of resolving disputes.</p>
        <p>The first session is scheduled for Saturday, Nov. 15, at 33 district offices staffed from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. by officials who have a wide range of duties and expertise. The Nov. 15 sites include the district offices in Manhattan (212 436-1013), Brooklyn (718 488-3601) Newark (973 645-3886) and Hartford (860 240-4156). Thereafter, sessions will be rotated within districts (there will be one in each district each month, but the cities will change), and the hours may be modified to include, say, weekday evenings.</p>
        <p>Such forums are the outgrowth of a program that has sprung up in the last few years in the I.R.S. offices in Greensboro, N.C., and other cities. While the first forums were considered successful models, relatively few taxpayers showed up, perhaps, the I.R.S. says, for lack of publicity.</p>
        <p>This time, though, I.R.S. officials plan heavy publicity. Also, they request -- but do not insist -- that taxpayers make a telephone reservation. For other sites and reservations, taxpayers can call the I.R.S. at (800) 829-1040.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monks says the sessions are intended to tackle any longstanding tax problems. But he adds that he is aiming mainly to resolve cases involving uncredited payments, scrambled Social Security numbers, delayed refunds, requests for abatement of various penalties, discrepancies between returns and Form 1099's filed directly by banks and other payers, and situations in which a taxpayer faces severe hardship from impending collection.</p>
        <p>''We can cut through these pretty fast,'' he said, perhaps resolving a case in as little as 15 minutes. Others, of course, could take hours or may have to be resolved in other ways.</p>
        <p>But taxpayers should not come to sessions to ask for advice on, say, whether something is deductible or how to survive an audit.</p>
        <p>''This is not a day to come in and ask technical tax questions,'' Mr. Monks said. And the Taxpayer Advocate never intervenes when I.R.S. enforcers have begun a formal audit.</p>
        <p>Could Mr. Monks himself become a casualty of the new I.R.S. approach to taxpayer problems? Charles O. Rossotti, the new Commissioner of Internal Revenue, said during hearings in October that the Taxpayer Advocate was so important that he would select a future advocate from outside the agency to make sure the official is regarded as an independent ally of the taxpayer.</p>
        <p>Some tax experts have greeted the trouble-shooting sessions with what might be called skeptical enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>''This is something that should have begun a long time ago,'' said Richard Davis, who once worked in the chief counsel's office at the I.R.S. and is now an assistant professor of accounting at Susquehanna University in Selinsgrove, Pa.</p>
        <p>But he wondered about the agency's ability to bring its antiquated computer system to bear on individual cases and whether its workers would be given enough discretion to resolve disputes. No matter how good the planning, Professor Davis added, ''They're still limited by the resources they have.''</p>
        <p>Gerry W. Padwe, vice president for taxation at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, pointed to ''continuing problems with overlapping communications'' at the I.R.S. that seem to confound the agency's most strenuous efforts. ''Before they have processed your response, the computer spits out a new notice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And Claude Renshaw, professor of business at St. Mary's College in South Bend, Ind., said he doubted that the I.R.S. was capable of conducting a ''warm and fuzzy'' cut-the-red-tape program. ''I'd like to see them pull it off,'' he said. ''But up until now, they've been reluctant to do things other than through channels.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Monks expressed confidence that the agency's computers would be able to quickly call up taxpayers' accounts and that there would be plenty of expertise and authority on hand at the Saturday sessions, he acknowledged the risk that expectations could go too high. ''We don't want to make it seem like we can work miracles,'' he said, noting that resolution does not have to mean that one side capitulates but instead can produce compromises.</p>
        <p>Should a taxpayer exhaust the normal remedies, there is always a last resort -- Form 911, used to apply for something called a taxpayer assistance order. Providing you can show hardship in getting necessities like food or medical care, this form would prevent the agency from getting at your pay or bank account.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monks said that about 32,000 people  ''dialed'' 911 each year and that about half the pleas were accepted.</p>
