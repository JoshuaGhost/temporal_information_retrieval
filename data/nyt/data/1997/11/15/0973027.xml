        <p>With wide receivers Ike Hilliard and Thomas Lewis both lost for the season, the Giants have wanted to make Amani Toomer -- the only receiver on the team taller than 5 feet 10 inches -- a starter and a featured part of the offense.</p>
        <p>But the Giants coaches did not like Toomer's practice habits and felt they could not trust him to run the right pass route at the right time.</p>
        <p>''We're in a precise business,'' a Giants assistant coach said last month. ''And Amani is not being precise. The quarterbacks don't know exactly what speed he'll run or exactly where he'll be.''</p>
        <p>But recently, Giants Coach Jim Fassel and some of his assistants sat Toomer down again, encouraging him to improve his performance in practice and his focus in reading defenses' reads and running pass routes. Apparently, the pep talks worked.</p>
        <p>After today's practice, Fassel announced that he planned to play Toomer more in Sunday's game against the Arizona Cardinals.</p>
        <p>Toomer will not start, but he will be a prominent part of the passing attack. This is a big step up for Toomer, a second-round pick a year ago. He had dropped in the receiving depth chart below starters Chris Calloway and Kevin Alexander, and below David Patten, the free-agent veteran of the Arena Football League.</p>
        <p>The move is a potential career turning point for the 6-foot 2-inch Toomer and an acknowledgment that quarterback Danny Kanell needs a better target in goal-line situations, when passes into the corner of the end zone often become jump-ball situations.</p>
        <p>Toomer today conceded that his promotion was the result of some extra effort on his part. ''I think they saw me practicing harder and trying to focus more,'' he said. ''They saw me doing more in practice than I had before.''</p>
        <p>And Toomer understands that his size plays a factor. Asked to describe what he did wrong when he dropped a game-tying pass in the end zone during last week's loss to the Tennessee Oilers, Toomer said: ''I didn't use my height. I was kind of falling back instead of going up to catch the ball at a higher point. I've been working on that in practice all week.''</p>
        <p>Toomer's career with the Giants got off to a stunning start when he returned a punt 87 yards for a touchdown in his first National Football League game last season. But he caught just one pass for 12 yards in the next 7 games, then tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee Oct. 20, ending his season.</p>
        <p>This summer, Toomer was the best receiver in training camp during the first two weeks as he showed no signs of his knee injury. But as camp wound down, Toomer seemed to fade from the offensive picture.</p>
        <p>''The balls stopped coming my way,'' Toomer said today of the end of training camp. ''I don't know why. But the balls stopped.''</p>
        <p>When Hilliard went down with a neck injury after the second game of the regular season, Lewis took his place. And when Lewis was injured after the fourth game, Alexander got the starting job, which angered Toomer.</p>
        <p>But Fassel met with Toomer and, according to team officials, explained for the first time what the Giants felt he was not doing properly. It has taken a few more weeks -- and a loss to Tennessee when the Giants' wide receivers caught just 7 passes for 97 yards -- but Toomer has moved back into the picture.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to give Amani more opportunities to show me the things he can do,'' Fassel said.</p>
        <p>When Toomer was asked today how he would describe his professional career so far, he said: ''Flashes. Some plays I have done what I can do well. Other plays, it's not there. If I can get the flashes into a consistent thing, I'll be where I want to be.</p>
        <p>''I think there's room for me on this team. I just have to do something with this chance because I've been waiting for it for a while.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Coach JIM FASSEL said he expected running back TIKI BARBER to be far more involved in third-down situations. Barber was one of the team's leading receivers early in the season, but did not catch a pass in his first game back from a knee injury last week. . . . Fassel held Friday's workout inside the practice bubble but did not turn the heat on, and may even have had the air-conditioning on. He said he wanted to simulate Sunday's game-time weather conditions. The forecast calls for temperatures in the 30's, with heavy winds and perhaps snow flurries.</p>
