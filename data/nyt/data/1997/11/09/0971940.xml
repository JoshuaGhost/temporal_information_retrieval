        <p>THEY are neglected, starved, abandoned in empty apartments, chained outside in freezing temperatures, tossed into the garbage, beaten and deliberately mutilated and tortured. They are pitted against one another in bloody fights so that their owners can gamble on the outcomes. Yet the dogs, cats and other animals who suffer such inhumane treatment cannot speak for themselves. They must rely on humans to protect them and to enforce laws preventing their abuse.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 14 from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., a symposium on preventing, investigating and prosecuting cruelty to animals will be held at Iona College in New Rochelle. Sponsored by the Companion Animal Coalition, a nonprofit organization that operates from various houses in Westchester, the New Rochelle Police Department and the New York State Humane Association, the symposium will include speakers like the Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, Sgt. Frank Donovan of the county Department of Public Safety Services, who, with Assistant District Attorney Susan Cacace, teaches a course in investigating animal cruelty at the Westchester Police Academy, and Dr. Randall Lockwood, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States. Its goals are to familiarize law-enforcement officials and the general public with the cruelty laws, to describe successful ways of investigating and prosecuting cruelty cases, and to discuss the ''documented relationship between cruelty to animals and cruelty and violence toward humans,'' said Harold S. Hovel, a founder of the Companion Animal Coalition. The cost is $10; for reservations call 232-8089.</p>

        <p>On Nov. 14 from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., a symposium on preventing, investigating and prosecuting cruelty to animals will be held at Iona College in New Rochelle. Sponsored by the Companion Animal Coalition, a nonprofit organization that operates from various houses in Westchester, the New Rochelle Police Department and the New York State Humane Association, the symposium will include speakers like the Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro, Sgt. Frank Donovan of the county Department of Public Safety Services, who, with Assistant District Attorney Susan Cacace, teaches a course in investigating animal cruelty at the Westchester Police Academy, and Dr. Randall Lockwood, vice president of the Humane Society of the United States. Its goals are to familiarize law-enforcement officials and the general public with the cruelty laws, to describe successful ways of investigating and prosecuting cruelty cases, and to discuss the ''documented relationship between cruelty to animals and cruelty and violence toward humans,'' said Harold S. Hovel, a founder of the Companion Animal Coalition. The cost is $10; for reservations call 232-8089.</p>
        <p>''The legal system -- in fact, society as a whole -- does not take animal cruelty seriously,'' Mr. Hovel said. ''Many people do not think of animals as sentient, feeling beings. They don't recognize their suffering.'' But, he added, even people who are not particularly concerned about animals per se should recognize the ''well-documented connection between cruelty to animals and violent acts against people -- numerous studies have shown that many violent criminals have a childhood and teen-age history of torturing animals.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro, who described herself as an animal lover, agreed, saying:  ''Animals are important in their own right and must be protected.So often when we check a violent criminal's record, we see a record of animal abuse. Too often, this kind of abuse as been overlooked, treated as some kind of adolescent prank. That's absolutely outrageous.''</p>
        <p>She said that her office prosecutes animal cruelty cases to the full extent of the law -- ''We do not plea-bargain down'' -- and that of the 25 cases tried in 1996, 97 percent resulted in convictions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro, Mr. Hovel and Sergeant Donovan would like to see legislative changes in the form of larger fines and longer jail terms for those convicted of animal cruelty. Cruelty is defined as ''every act, omission or neglect whereby unjustifiable physical pain, suffering or death is caused or permitted.'' It is a misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of one year and/or a $1,000 fine.</p>
        <p>Promoting or permitting animal fighting is a felony with a four-year maximum term and a $25,000 maximum fine. Sergeant Donovan said he would like to see all forms of intentional abuse raised to felony level. He also said that the animal cruelty laws fall under the category of ''obscure agriculture and market laws'' and that they should be moved to the main section of the Penal Code.</p>
