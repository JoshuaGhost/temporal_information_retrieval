        <p>FOR most preschoolers, playing house is as familiar and predictable as learning to ride a tricycle or build a block tower. For the half-dozen or so children who show up on Tuesday afternoons at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Westchester Division here, playing house takes on a different dimension.</p>
        <p>At some play sessions, the children -- who range in age from 3 to 6 -- will designate their play tepees as Mommy's house or Daddy's house. At others, the children will spend much of their playtime crawling back and forth through plastic tunnels, saying ''hello'' and ''goodbye'' to one another or conducting imaginary conversations with an absent parent on toy telephones.</p>

        <p>FOR most preschoolers, playing house is as familiar and predictable as learning to ride a tricycle or build a block tower. For the half-dozen or so children who show up on Tuesday afternoons at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Westchester Division here, playing house takes on a different dimension.</p>
        <p>At some play sessions, the children -- who range in age from 3 to 6 -- will designate their play tepees as Mommy's house or Daddy's house. At others, the children will spend much of their playtime crawling back and forth through plastic tunnels, saying ''hello'' and ''goodbye'' to one another or conducting imaginary conversations with an absent parent on toy telephones.</p>
        <p>Such play provides a comforting routine for those enrolled in the hospital's Children of Divorce Program. The preschool group, which was started about three years ago, is meant to help young children understand what divorce means and help them cope with issues like visitation, new family arrangements and custody.</p>
        <p>''The mothers have a catastrophic reaction to divorce and hope that their children won't react or register anything,'' said Dr. Paulina F. Kernberg, professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical College and director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center Westchester Division. ''These children react without words. They show the  impact of divorce in their bodies, in changes in eating and sleeping, for  example.</p>
        <p>''The child loses his world. The mother may be a good mother but is preoccupied with the divorce and is not emotionally available, which pulls the rug out from under him.''</p>
        <p>Some parents may observe that their formerly boisterous and outgoing preschoolers become shy around strangers or peers, while once fearless explorers may be more reluctant to leave their mother's side. Other changes signaling a child's unsettled response to divorce can include increased separation anxiety, regression in toilet skills or increased anger toward parents, siblings and peers.</p>
        <p>''These children are left with an experience that they have, but don't understand where it came from,''  Dr. Kernberg said. ''Their language is play, and in play they can make different endings.''</p>
        <p>While their parents -- usually mothers but occasionally fathers or grandmothers take part in the group -- meet with Dr. Kernberg, the children have a chance to play in an adjacent room under the unstructured but watchful guidance of Dr. Diane DiGiacomo and Pamela Ancowitz, where they can handle issues on their own level. As part of the sessions, the parents can watch their children on videotape to observe their reactions, and the professionals meet as a team to discuss their concerns.</p>
        <p>''The biggest problem is that parents feel that a young child won't understand anything, and so the parent won't tell them anything,'' said Mrs. Ancowitz, who is also director of Parents Place, a nonprofit, family  support center in White Plains offering classes in how to be a parent.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of hurt and anger, and it can be hard for parents to separate out the relationship with a hated ex-spouse to put the child's  needs first. What's helpful about the group setting is that the children know they're not alone, or not the only ones whose parents are divorced.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ancowitz continued: ''Preschoolers are having separation anxiety already. We deal with issues that are important for preschoolers. We've had kids say, 'Even dogs have homes, but daddy doesn't.' For the younger child, the whole idea of a visit to the noncustodial parent is terrifying.''</p>
        <p>In the sessions for parents, there is emphasis not only on issues that concern their children but also on how the parents are navigating the divorce and its aftermath.</p>
        <p>''One of the goals in the group is to permit mothers to begin to feel that they are women,'' Dr. Kernberg said. ''We help them see how they can preserve their needs to have a mate and not repeat their traumatic experience. They need to learn how to cooperate with their ex-spouse to provide the child with continuity.''</p>
        <p>One mother, who took part in the program last year and spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said that her child had vacillated between being angry and clinging and insecure when the two of them started the program. ''My child was having a very hard time with visitation,'' the mother said. ''The group helped me learn that a bad father is better than no father. And in the group, my child started to comprehend why mommy had one house, and daddy had another house.''</p>
        <p>Those wanting more information about the 12-session program, which has a counterpart designed for school-age children, can call Dr. DiGiacomo at 997-4341.</p>
