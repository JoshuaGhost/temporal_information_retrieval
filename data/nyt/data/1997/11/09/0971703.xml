        <p>Four months after a billionaire Mexican drug trafficker, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, was reported dead following plastic surgery, the Mexican authorities finally ruled his death a homicide. They also announced that three plastic surgeons had been charged with murder, accused of intentionally giving Mr. Carrillo a lethal cocktail of anesthetics and a sedative.</p>
        <p>But for at least two of the physicians, the charges mean nothing. Of three mutilated bodies found in sealed drums along a roadside last Sunday, two have been identified as two of the plastic surgeons who reshaped the drug trafficker's nose and midriff in July. More tests will determine whether the third body is the third surgeon.</p>
