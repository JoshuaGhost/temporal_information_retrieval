        <p>ANYBODY who has happened on WNBC-TV, Channel 4, lately may have come upon a particularly portentous advertisement. The scene is some sort of a hangar, bathed in rich blue light and filled with a sibilant whirr.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing else like it,'' says the voice-over man, nearly growling. ''And no one else has it.'' Suddenly the camera reveals a striking black silhouette, something like a giant cricket with two big turbines strapped to its sides. ''Get ready,'' concludes the voice. ''For the new'' -- long pause -- ''Chopper-4.''</p>

        <p>ANYBODY who has happened on WNBC-TV, Channel 4, lately may have come upon a particularly portentous advertisement. The scene is some sort of a hangar, bathed in rich blue light and filled with a sibilant whirr.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing else like it,'' says the voice-over man, nearly growling. ''And no one else has it.'' Suddenly the camera reveals a striking black silhouette, something like a giant cricket with two big turbines strapped to its sides. ''Get ready,'' concludes the voice. ''For the new'' -- long pause -- ''Chopper-4.''</p>
        <p>While the promotion's tone might suggest some sequelized thriller, the ad actually signals the latest escalation in New York's fierce news-helicopter wars, an ongoing battle for control of the city's air and airwaves. Channel 4 is claiming that its new flying machine, due to take flight by year's end, will make the competition seethe with envy.</p>
        <p>''It is unlike any other news chopper in the world,'' said Paula Walker, the news director. ''It's so much more superior.''</p>
        <p>WCBS, Channel 2, begs to differ. The station launched a preemptive attack on Oct. 15, rolling out its latest weapon, a helicopter-mounted infrared camera that the station touts as capable of ''unparalleled pictures in no-light and low-light news situations.'' And WABC, Channel 7, has responded by running promotions pointing out that it has two news helicopters. Meanwhile, at Channel 5, WNYW, an official answered a query about air capability with a curt two-sentence statement: ''We are happy with our helicopter coverage,'' said Hilary Hendler, the general manager. ''We think the viewers don't want gimmicks.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not the choppers are gimmicks, what is certain is that the war they have sparked is an expensive one. Channel 2 spent approximately $200,000 on its new infrared camera. And while Channel 4 officials won't talk prices, the station's spokeswoman, Terry Doll, said the helicopter cost ''at least seven figures.''</p>
        <p>Much about the new Chopper-4 is shrouded in the kind of secrecy usually reserved for reporters' toupees. Station officials gave vague answers about cost, and would not reveal the new helicopter's size or video capabilities. The timing for the promotions seems clear: this is sweeps month, a 28-day period when stations gauge the size of their audiences -- and thus the size of their advertising rates. (The station had hoped to have the chopper flying by now, but Ms. Doll said it still hadn't been delivered.)</p>
        <p>''Of course, we don't do it for sweeps,'' said Bart Feder, the news director of Channel 7, with a tongue-in-cheek defensiveness. ''We do it for journalistic pleasure.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the motive, the increased competition in high-flying coverage is a relatively new phenomenon in New York. While the news helicopter has been a staple in Los Angeles and Houston since the 1970's, New York's aerial fixation didn't begin in earnest until about 1994, when WNBC introduced its first Chopper-4 with a new gyrostabilized camera, permitting steady, focused feeds from overhead. Both WABC and WCBS soon followed.</p>
        <p>Some news officials remained skeptical until two events in 1996 showed the choppers' usefulness -- the January blizzard and the crash of Flight 800. But those big stories don't come along every day: one of the first uses of Channel 2's infrared camera was a small house fire in the Bronx. ''We saw it in a different light,'' said Mr. Carey.</p>
        <p>Regardless of whether helicopters are help or hype, it seems they are here to stay. And the skirmishes are likely to escalate.</p>
        <p>''Certain technology has become mandatory,'' said Mr. Feder of Channel 7. ''The truth is, helicopters can be tremendous help in covering the news. Or traffic.''</p>
