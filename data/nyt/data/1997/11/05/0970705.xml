        <p>Four years after the Clinton Administration said it would prod Mexico to improve workers' rights through agreements made along with the North American free trade pact, many Democrats and labor unions say results have been scant, complicating the White House's efforts to win new trade-negotiating authority.</p>
        <p>Just as it did in campaigning for the free-trade zone with Canada and Mexico in 1993, the White House is promising Democrats that it will do all it can to improve the labor and environmental standards of the nation's trading partners, even if strong opposition from Republicans prevents making these improvements a condition of access to the American market.</p>
        <p>Those promises, along with other efforts to woo Democrats, helped the Administration win a critical procedural victory today in the Senate on the so-called fast-track legislation. But the fate of the legislation remains unclear in the House, where organized labor is making an all-out push to stop it.</p>
        <p>One key reason for the reluctance of many House Democrats to back the measure is that the Administration's assurances about pushing for labor and environmental reforms in other countries ring hollow to them, given the outcome of the White House's similar efforts in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
        <p>The lesson of Nafta, they say, is that labor and environmental issues must be at the heart of trade agreements, not relegated to hard-to-enforce side agreements or other pacts like the ''executive initiatives'' the Administration is now pledging to implement.</p>
        <p>''The Nafta experience indicates that we need to tackle labor market and environmental issues directly, not indirectly,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, said labor and environmental issues ''need to be addressed in the core text of trade agreements, not as an 'executive-initiative' afterthought.''</p>
        <p>''If they are in the core text, commitments made can be enforced,'' said Mr. Gephardt, who is leading the opposition to the fast-track measure. When the President has fast-track authority, Congress may only agree to approve or disapprove trade agreements but not amend them.</p>
        <p>In particular, the skeptics point to the Nafta side agreement on labor issues.</p>
        <p>To some degree, the limitations seen by its critics were inherent in its structure. Formally known as the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, it was not intended to judge or punish companies for their labor practices. It did not seek to create common labor standards among Mexico, Canada and the United States. It provides for the possibility of sanctions only in extreme cases where one of the three governments signing the agreement has shown a pervasive pattern of failing to enforce its own labor laws.</p>
        <p>In the United States, the agreement is administered by an eight-person staff in the Labor Department with an annual budget of about $800,000. Mexico and Canada each have a similar office, and the three countries together pay for a small ''secretariat'' in Dallas.</p>
        <p>In nearly three years, seven complaints about Mexican labor practices have been filed with the American office, plus one filed with the Mexican labor authorities about Sprint, an American company operating in the United States. In none of the cases has the outcome gone beyond private meetings at which American officials have expressed their concerns about Mexican labor practices to their counterparts in the Mexican Government.</p>
        <p>Since the provisions are intended only to push the Governments involved to enforce their own existing domestic labor laws, no direct action has been taken against any of the employers involved.</p>
        <p>American officials said it was unrealistic to believe that Mexico -- or the United States or Canada, for that matter -- would have agreed to an international process that would supersede domestic labor laws and give the United States the authority to impose sanctions on companies operating in Mexico.</p>
        <p>Given the nature of the provisions, they said, the process has had more impact in Mexico than it is given credit for. And they said the provisions should be judged not by what labor groups hoped that they could accomplish -- bringing wholesale changes to Mexico's deeply rooted economic and political systems -- but by the more modest goal of serving as a prod to Mexico to take labor issues more seriously.</p>
        <p>''It's contributed to an unprecedented level of scrutiny of Mexican labor law and allowed for a process of review and public discussion that has contributed in some important ways to debates already occurring within Mexican society on these same matters,'' said Andrew Samet, deputy undersecretary for international affairs at the Labor Department.</p>
        <p>''It's obviously not intended to create a substitute mechanism for U.S., Canadian or Mexican labor law,'' he said. ''It's also not designed inherently to provide any additional recourse to adjudicate individual rights.''</p>
        <p>But labor rights groups take a much dimmer view of the agreement. They point to cases like the one prompted by a bitter clash between management and employees at the Sony videocassette plant just over the Texas border in Mexico during 1994. To labor activists, the dispute was a perfect example of how the Mexican Government and big companies had long discouraged the creation of independent unions. The Labor Department investigated their complaint.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department heard reports that Sony had terminated workers who tried to organize a new, more assertive union. It listened to stories about the police beating workers who protested against the company's tactics. Despite statements from Sony that it had obeyed the law and that the labor groups were distorting what had happened, the Labor Department ultimately found, in April 1995, that there were ''serious questions'' about the way the workers had been treated.</p>
        <p>And then it recommended the strongest action available to it: closed-door talks between the American and Mexican labor Secretaries, which led to public workshops in both countries on union organizing and certification.</p>
        <p>The dismissed workers were not reinstated. The organizing effort at the plant remains stalled.</p>
        <p>Labor groups said the initiatives pledged by the Administration to deal with labor and environmental issues in any trade deals reached under fast-track authority would be similarly toothless. They said the Administration should have taken a tougher stand with the Republican majority in Congress and insisted on making sure labor and the environment were as central to trade agreements as issues like fighting piracy of computer software and movies.</p>
        <p>''Unless these things are enforceable within the context of the trade agreement, they are paper tigers,'' said David A. Smith, the policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.</p>
