        <p>STATEN ISLAND  Republicans Keep The Molinari Seat</p>
        <p>In the nation's only Congressional race, Vito J. Fossella Jr., a Republican, claimed victory in the campaign for the seat representing Staten Island vacated by another Republican, Susan Molinari.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fossella, a City Councilman, defeated Eric N. Vitaliano, a Democrat, who was a State Assemblyman for 15 years. Mr. Fossella promised to cut taxes, championed school choice and opposed the Federal ban on assault weapons. Page B1.</p>
        <p>IN THE SUBURBS  Upset in Westchester In County Executive Race</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, the Democratic candidate for County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, defeated the Republican, Ted Dunn of Rye. Mr. Spano promised to modernize county government while cutting county property taxes. Page B1.</p>
        <p>BALLOT QUESTION  Voters in New York State Reject Constitutional Issue</p>
        <p>New York voters turned down a measure that would have authorized a state constitutional convention in 1999. It had the backing of Gov. George E. Pataki and a $300,000 advertising campaign. But unions, fearing the loss of longstanding protections, opposed the measure. Page B1.</p>
        <p>VIRGINIA  A Promise to Cut Taxes Helps Elect a Governor</p>
        <p>James S. Gilmore 3d, a former State Attorney General, was elected governor of Virginia, leading the first ever Republican sweep of the state's three highest offices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilmore easily defeated his Democratic challenger, Lieut. Gov. Donald S. Beyer Jr.</p>
        <p>He promised that his first priority would be fulfilling his campaign pledge to eliminate the unpopular personal property tax on cars and trucks. The Republican sweep included victories in races for lieutenant governor and attorney general and continued a steady conservative shift in the state. Page A24.</p>
        <p>ELSEWHERE IN THE NATION  A Runoff in Houston; Easy Work for Incumbents</p>
        <p>Lee P. Brown, the former New York City Police Commissioner, finished ahead of a crowded field in the Houston mayoral race but failed to capture the majority vote needed to win it outright.</p>
        <p>In Boston, Thomas H. Menino, a Democrat, became the first incumbent mayor in the city's history to face no opposition in the general election.</p>
        <p>And in Oregon, a groundbreaking law permitting doctor-assisted suicide survived a challenge, as voters overwhelmingly turned down a bid to repeal it. Page A24.</p>
