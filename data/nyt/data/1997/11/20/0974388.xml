        <p>Jorge Velasquez, who became a jockey in Panama ''to get my family out of poverty,'' said yesterday that he would ride for the last time at the end of December after a 30-year career that placed him among the leading money-winners for 20 straight years.</p>
        <p>He was the regular rider on Alydar, he rode Pleasant Colony to victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness in 1981 and five times he was ranked as New York's leading jockey. And, true to his ambition to rescue his family from hard times, he rode horses that won $125 million in purses.</p>

And, true to his ambition to rescue his family from hard times, he rode horses that won $125 million in purses.</p>
        <p>''I'm 50 years old and healthy,'' Velasquez said yesterday at Aqueduct race track. ''But the trainers for some reason aren't riding me. So, Dec. 31 will be my last day of racing. Maybe they think I'm too old and won't take the chances I used to. Or, maybe they think I have too much money.''</p>
        <p>In his career, Velasquez rode 40,847 horses, won with 6,795 of them and ran in the money 18,728 times.</p>
