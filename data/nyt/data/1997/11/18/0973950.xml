        <p>Rebounding from early weakness, Treasury securities prices moved higher yesterday, after a benign industrial production report for October alleviated some fears of inflation among investors.</p>
        <p>The 30-year bond gained 14/32, to a price of 100 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 6.06 percent, from 6.10 percent on Friday. Volume was  somewhat lighter than it had been as investors awaited today's consumer price report; on average, analysts expect a gain of two-tenths of a percent over all in the October Consumer Price Index, with a one-tenth of a  percent gain excluding the volatile food and energy categories.</p>
        <p>While industrial production in October rose by a healthy five-tenths of a percent, that was less than analysts expected. And Maury N. Harris, chief economist at Paine Webber Inc., said, ''Slower gains are in store due to both negative upcoming trade effects from Asia and also the recent softening in U.S. retail sales of durable goods.''</p>
        <p>The market reacted favorably to the report, as investors concluded that it added to the recent signs of a slowing economy, which would reduce the need for an interest-rate increase to head off inflation. But for the interest-rate-sensitive bond market, Mr. Harris added, next month's industrial production report could be more significant; it will be issued on Dec. 15, a day before the next meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy.</p>
        <p>Bond prices were also helped yesterday by a drop in oil prices as it appeared less likely that the standoff between the United States and Iraq would result in military action.</p>
        <p>Initially, the market was down after a strong rally in overseas stock markets. The big gains, particularly in Tokyo stocks raised concerns among Treasury investors that the recent strength in the bond market,  fueled by a so-called flight to quality because of concern over volatility in global stock markets, might now reverse itself.</p>
        <p>William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a speech to a group of German mortgage bankers, indicated that he was growing more confident that the Asian financial crisis was close to ending. ''Still that doesn't mean there won't be additional swings in prices,'' he said. ''We shouldn't assume that the markets are already fully stabilized.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said yesterday's weekly auction of new Treasury bills saw moderate demand, in line with expectations. The average rate at auction was 5.165 percent for both the three-month and six-month issue. Even though the slowing of the flight to quality from overseas generally pressured the bill market yesterday, the auction was helped by tightened supply. The Treasury sold only $14.5 billion of bills, down from $15 billion  as recently as early October.</p>
