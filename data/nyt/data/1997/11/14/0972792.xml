      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Matthew Barney is as obscure as he is flamboyant and considerably more elusive, in all ways, than his media-crazed doppelganger, Damien Hirst of England. Working in film and sculpture, with a strong performance-art component, Mr. Barney continues to push the envelope of his eccentric ideas about beauty, sexual ambiguity, symbolic narrative and the body's potential for transformation. Still, it helps to remember that he is a young, developing artist who does some things better than others, despite his considerable achievement and influence.</p>
        <p>At the moment Mr. Barney's moving pictures have outdistanced his stationary objects. ''Cremaster 5,'' the third film in his ''Cremaster'' series, is a 54-minute feast of ravishing sequences and scenes, tied together by Arthurian themes of love, contest, loss and death, and spiced with frequent references to the history of painting. An opera with music by Jonathan Bepler and a libretto by Mr. Barney, it may take hints from Peter Greenaway, Federico Fellini and Jean Cocteau. But it also antes up Mr. Barney's heady mix of hot-house perfectionism, fairy-tale fantasy, endurance-art ritual and decorous gender-bending. And it moves faster, in more compelling rhythms than its predecessors.</p>

        <p>Matthew Barney is as obscure as he is flamboyant and considerably more elusive, in all ways, than his media-crazed doppelganger, Damien Hirst of England. Working in film and sculpture, with a strong performance-art component, Mr. Barney continues to push the envelope of his eccentric ideas about beauty, sexual ambiguity, symbolic narrative and the body's potential for transformation. Still, it helps to remember that he is a young, developing artist who does some things better than others, despite his considerable achievement and influence.</p>
        <p>At the moment Mr. Barney's moving pictures have outdistanced his stationary objects. ''Cremaster 5,'' the third film in his ''Cremaster'' series, is a 54-minute feast of ravishing sequences and scenes, tied together by Arthurian themes of love, contest, loss and death, and spiced with frequent references to the history of painting. An opera with music by Jonathan Bepler and a libretto by Mr. Barney, it may take hints from Peter Greenaway, Federico Fellini and Jean Cocteau. But it also antes up Mr. Barney's heady mix of hot-house perfectionism, fairy-tale fantasy, endurance-art ritual and decorous gender-bending. And it moves faster, in more compelling rhythms than its predecessors.</p>
        <p>The exhibition of sculptures, installations and photographs generated by this film, at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery in Chelsea, is beautiful, too, but also vacantly decorative, nearly devoid of meaning without seeing the film. This is not to say the sculptures are short on ambition. They may, in fact, be an improvement over those generated by the two previous Cremaster films. They show the artist working with an impeccable sense of craft and scale in an impressive array of materials, including blown glass, acrylic, cast resin, prosthetic plastic and sewn fabric.</p>
        <p>But the results are often slick, expensive-looking, almost kitschy geegaws that operate in the slippery terrain between Jeff Koons and Robert Morris. Separated from the animating, enriching effects of the videos that Mr. Barney once considered essential to their display, his sculptures feel inert and stranded.</p>
        <p>All Mr. Barney's recent sculptures revolve around his ''Cremaster'' series, a projected five-part film saga (being made out of order) of nearly Wagnerian proportions. Think of it as the most elaborate, prolonged and biologically strange coming-of-age story ever told, or a spectacular yet obscure dramatization of the reproductive system. Each film has a specific and symbolic setting, a distinctive palette and period style, and a cast of exotic characters, complete with fabulous attire, body-altering makeup, fetishized shoes (or feet) and unusual props.</p>
        <p>''Cremaster 4'' (1995), the first of Mr. Barney's videos to be transferred to film and shown in theaters, was set on the Isle of Man, bathed in nursery-rhyme colors and imbued with an entrancing turn-of-the-century look that was part vaudeville, part Symbolism. The less impressive ''Cremaster 1'' (1995) was staged in a football stadium in Boise, Idaho, the artist's hometown, and styled a la Busby Berkeley.</p>
        <p>''Cremaster 5,'' the grand finale, takes place in Budapest, the birthplace of one of Mr. Barney's heroes, Ehrich Weiss, later known as Harry Houdini. The look is restrained Baroque with a touch of Rococo in blacks and reds relieved by pink. Extravagant backgrounds include the Budapest Opera House, a vaulted Turkish bath and the Lanchid (Hungarian for Chain) Bridge spanning the chilly Danube.</p>
        <p>The vague but clearly tragic plot centers on the Queen of Chain, played by Ursula Andress encased in voluminous black and pink satin. She spends most of the film being piloted about the royal opera box by two nearly identical ushers wearing red beribboned Elizabethan doublets. Meanwhile, her three consorts or suitors, all played by Mr. Barney, perform dramatic, sometimes suicidal feats of daring.</p>
        <p>The Magician, naked beneath his black cape, rides a black horse across the Lanchid Bridge and, after striking Michelangelesque poses on one of its pylons, dives off it, wearing white manacles.</p>
        <p>As the pink-clad Diva, who looks like one of Watteau's wandering minstrels, he climbs the flower-bedecked proscenium arch of the Opera House stage and is later shown fallen, his head a melted, somewhat scrotal pool of pink goo.</p>
        <p>The Giant, the Neptune-like inhabitant of a watery underworld (the Turkish bath) visible through holes in the Queen's throne, could have floated in on waves by Philipp Otto Runge or Gustave Moreau. His whitened torso erupts from a red, flaring shape that suggests a Calla lily. In one of the movie's most breathtaking scenes, the Giant stands in the middle of a shallow pool whose surface is afloat with big, white pearls. Seven Jacobin pigeons -- ruffed and pure white -- rise suddenly above him, trailing pale green ribbons that a cadre of Water Sprites have attached to his carefully disguised testicles.</p>
        <p>The Gladstone exhibition functions primarily as a souvenir box for the film, which reopens today at the Film Forum. The front of the gallery is covered with a black scrim featuring the veiled face of the perpetually anguished Queen. The entrance gallery has been transformed into a sleekly funereal processional hall of black satin walls and banners appliqued with fleur-de-lys-like symbols that may also imply ovaries and testicles.</p>
        <p>The most seductive installation consists of seven large ''production stills'' (taken during filming but not in the film) of the Water Sprites, whose pink androgynous bodies, soft goatlike ears and webbed feet, against brightly garlanded backdrops, give science fiction a Pre-Raphaelite dimension.</p>
        <p>The largest and slickest installation, ''Lanchid: The Lament of the Queen of Chain,'' unites the Queen and the Giant. A ghost made of various clear or translucent materials, it includes replicas of the pool's double stairs (the Giant's podium); the Queen's finely fringed cape (it twists and writhes, as if Bernini's St. Theresa might emerge); her throne, with its opulent base, footrests and tantalizingly narrow seat and finally her veil and bulbous headdress, which evoke chemistry beakers or bent dumbbells.</p>
        <p>Somewhat stronger is ''The Ehrich Weiss Suite,'' visible through a glass door and including a triptych of photographs, the Magician's white manacles displayed in a clear-sided coffin and five more pigeons, these with black wings, that drift about the floor like black-caped Venetians crossing one of Canaletto's piazzas. Art involving live animals is usually gimmicky, but here the birds add a mesmerizing spark of life.</p>
        <p>For the most part, this exhibition reduces the strange luxuriant objects and images of Mr. Barney's film to mere luxury items. These give little indication, so abundant in the film, of his unusual ability to imbue conventionally decorative forms with meaning, partly through odd distortions, partly by lingering over their intensely wrought details.</p>
        <p>In a sense, his most interesting ideas about form and space -- the rudiments of sculpture -- are in his films, in the actual and symbolic way he propels his characters through space, in their startling physical acts, transformations and inspired costumes. The possibilities of all these elements joined and choreographed on film consume Mr. Barney in a way that for the moment, at least, makes nearly everything else seem secondary.</p>
        <p>The sculptures and production stills from Matthew Barney's film ''Cremaster 5'' are at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery, 515 West 24th Street, Chelsea, through Dec. 20. Starting today, the film is being shown daily at 10:30 P.M. at Film Forum, 209 Houston Street, South Village (212) 727-8110.</p>
