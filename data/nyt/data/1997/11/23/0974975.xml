        <p>WHEN JESSIE CAME ACROSS THE SEA. By Amy Hest. Illustrated by P. J. Lynch. Candlewick. $16.99. (Ages 6 to 12) At the age of 13, Jessie was given a ticket and sent from a poor village in Eastern Europe to America to help a widowed seamstress in New York City. She is a brave and hard-working girl, who finds love and a measure of success, so hers is a kind of Thanksgiving story.</p>
        <p>JAGUAR. Written and illustrated by Helen Cowcher. Scholastic. $15.95. (Ages 5 to 9) The majesty of the raging Venezuelan jaguar dissuades the hunter. Stunning illustrations in the artist's distinctive style, plus information on endangered species.</p>
        <p>LULLABY RAFT. By Naomi Shihab Nye. Illustrated by Vivienne Flesher. Simon &amp; Schuster. $16. (All ages) A child sings this lullaby verse about settling pets -- a chicken, a bunny, a turtle and a lizard -- to sleep. Music and seven verses of lyrics appear at the end.</p>
        <p>FLORA AND TIGER: 19 Very Short Stories From My Life. Written and illustrated by Eric Carle. Philomel. $17.95. (Ages 8 to 12) The writer and artist best known for ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' tells stories about animals or insects, based on his childhood in wartime Germany, his early years in this country and his life as an artist. Stories set in America have titles in red type; those in Germany, blue.</p>
        <p>THE CINDER-EYED CATS. Written and illustrated by Eric Rohmann. Crown. $17. (Ages 4 to 8) An almost wordless fantasy brings a little boy to a magical island where there are mysterious lizards and ''cats like velvet shadows move.'' Lush, imaginative illustrations of the dream.</p>
        <p>WATER BUFFALO DAYS: Growing Up in Vietnam. By Huynh Quang Nhuong. Illustrated by Jean and Mou-sein Tseng. HarperCollins. $13.95. (Ages 7 to 10) The author tells engaging stories about growing up in the central highlands of Vietnam in the 1940's, including adventures with his water buffalo, Tank. His father helped teach the children of the 50 families in the hamlet.</p>
