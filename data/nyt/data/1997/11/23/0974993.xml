        <p>If you don't know Polish, just point.</p>
        <p>Or, you want to test your linguistic skills, say ''crhis-CHICK-ee.''</p>
        <p>No matter how you do it, the object is to leave Judicke's Bakery in downtown Bayonne with a boxful of chrusciki, a traditional fried pastry covered with a cloud of powdered sugar. The price is $8 a pound for a taste of old Europe that is harder and harder to find in this fast-food society.</p>
        <p>The bakery has been in business since 1924, owned for decades by the Judicke family. About three and a half years ago, they sold it to Bernd Ritter and Gary Wurtenberg, who kept all the recipes that had withstood the test of time and added some new goodies as well.</p>
        <p>People who grew up with Judicke' have a hard time forgetting its sprinkle doughnuts, especially if they have childhood memories of watching the doughnut machine at work in Judicke's window. The machine is no longer there, and the doughnuts look different than they did in the Truman and Eisenhower years. The sprinkles, once soft pastels, are now shocking neon colors, because that's what what sprinkle suppliers make now.</p>
        <p>But the owners say the taste of the rich cruller dough has not changed, and they get orders form all ove rthe country to prove it. For 40 cents, you can judge for yourself. It's a small price to pay for a trip down memory lane, whether you've made the journey a thousand times or are making it for the very first time.</p>
        <p>Judicke's Bakery, 763 Broadway, Bayonne. (201)339-4664. Hours; 6:30 A.M. to 9:30 P.M., 365 days a year.</p>
