        <p>Giants linebacker Corey Miller left yesterday's game early in the second quarter because of a sprained right ankle.</p>
        <p>Miller, who left the Liberty Bowl in Memphis on crutches, sustained the injury when a pile of Tennessee linemen rolled over his leg.</p>
        <p>''I really thought it was broken,'' Miller said. ''And I can't say with 100 percent certainty that it isn't. But the X-rays they took here didn't show a break.''</p>
        <p>Marcus Buckley replaced Miller in the Giants' basic defense.</p>
        <p>Defensive end Chad Bratzke sprained his left knee, leaving the game in the second half. Offensive linemen Ron Stone and Scott Gragg also injured their left knees, though neither came out of the game.</p>
        <p>Return Unit Puts Club in a Hole</p>
        <p>The Giants' problems on the kickoff return team continued. The team has had trouble finding a return man who does not fumble. The veteran Erric Pegram had seemed to be the reliable answer, but he fumbled his first attempt at a return yesterday, forcing the Giants to begin their second possession on their 7-yard line.</p>
        <p>Fassel Sticking With Kanell</p>
        <p>It seemed a moot point because Coach Jim Fassel was emphatic last week that Danny Kanell was his starter for the rest of the year, but Fassel was asked after yesterday's defeat whether he would stick with Kanell.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' Fassel answered.</p>
        <p>Kanell was sacked 3 times for 22 yards in losses, the most he has been sacked since he replaced Dave Brown this season. ''It was probably the most I've been hit in the N.F.L.,'' Kanell said.</p>
        <p>Barber Returning Slowly</p>
        <p>Tiki Barber returned to the lineup for the first time since Sept. 28 but touched the ball just twice. His two carries netted a total of minus 1 yard.</p>
        <p>Kicker Brad Daluiso's two field goals give him a streak of nine consecutive attempts without a miss. . . . Earlier this season, Giants linebacker Corey Widmer had two interceptions negated by penalties. In the second quarter yesterday, he made a juggling, diving interception that stopped a promising Oilers drive deep in the Giants' end of the field. . . . The Giants' pass rush has been a team strength this season, but they had only one sack yesterday. For the season, they have 30, the same number the Giants had in 16 games last year.</p>
