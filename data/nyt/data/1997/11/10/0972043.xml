        <p>Albert M. Baer, a cutlery manufacturer and a supporter of heart research, died on Oct. 26 at his home in Rapidan, Va. He was 92 and also kept a residence in lower Manhattan, a family home for five generations.</p>
        <p>At his death, Mr. Baer was chairman of the Imperial Schrade Corporation of Ellenville, N.Y., makers of hunting and pocket knives and kitchen cutlery, and importers of flatware. He formed the company by combining five forerunners, and became its sole owner in 1984.</p>
        <p>In the 1960's, he accompanied Dr. Paul Dudley White, former President Dwight D. Eisenhower's physician, on a tour of some 30 countries to raise funds for cardiology research and education. Their efforts spawned several national societies, as well as the International Cardiology Foundation. Mr. Baer served as the chairman of a worldwide committee on fund raising for that foundation, which gave him its first Gold Heart Award in 1968. He also did work for the St. John's University College of Business Administration and for Columbia University, where he served as the national chairman of the General Studies Alumni Fund.</p>
        <p>A native of Manhattan, Mr. Baer graduated from City College.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Karla B. Baer; a daughter, Margery B. Irish of Stamford, Conn.; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p>
