        <p>Jeff Greenfield, who has been ABC News's best-known political analyst for 14 years, is leaving ABC next month to join the Cable News Network, CNN's new president, Richard Kaplan, announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenfield, who in addition to his prominent role covering politics also served as media critic and as a regular contributor to ''Nightline,'' said yesterday that he had been lured to CNN by the opportunity for more work.

        <p>Mr. Greenfield, who in addition to his prominent role covering politics also served as media critic and as a regular contributor to ''Nightline,'' said yesterday that he had been lured to CNN by the opportunity for more work.

        <p>Mr. Greenfield took pains to say his departure was no reflection on ABC News but was ''more a reflection of what CNN was offering.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan, who also came to CNN from a long career at ABC News, also announced the hiring of Judd Rose, a correspondent for ABC's ''Prime Time Live'' since 1989. Both Mr. Rose and Mr. Greenfield will remain based in New York. CNN's headquarters are in Atlanta.</p>
