        <p>A scenery-steeped puzzle, a haunting western, a stage classic and a political thriller form an inviting cluster of vintage films on television this week.</p>
        <p>The dazzling hues of the French Riviera color Alfred Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF (1955), as Cary Grant and Grace Kelly lead a polished cast in a sophisticated translation of David Dodge's novel. John Williams, as a suave sleuth tracking a cat burglar, almost steals the picture from the scenery, which takes some doing -- Thursday at 8 P.M. on Cinemax.</p>

        <p>A scenery-steeped puzzle, a haunting western, a stage classic and a political thriller form an inviting cluster of vintage films on television this week.</p>
        <p>The dazzling hues of the French Riviera color Alfred Hitchcock's TO CATCH A THIEF (1955), as Cary Grant and Grace Kelly lead a polished cast in a sophisticated translation of David Dodge's novel. John Williams, as a suave sleuth tracking a cat burglar, almost steals the picture from the scenery, which takes some doing -- Thursday at 8 P.M. on Cinemax.</p>
        <p>In THE GUNFIGHTER (1950), a quiet, steady and perceptive western, Gregory Peck delivers a touching performance as a reformed man determined to shake his notorious image. Under the veteran Henry King's astute direction, Helen Westcott, Millard Mitchell and Jean Parker surround Peck with able support. As the original Times review noted, if only the harassed gunslinger had stayed out of saloons -- Wednesday at 5:30 P.M. on American Movie Classics.</p>
        <p>Problems beset the Salvation Army heroine played by Wendy Hiller in George Bernard Shaw's MAJOR BARBARA (1941). Her father (Robert Morley) is a prominent munitions maker. A lovelorn colleague (Rex Harrison) is urging marriage. Ms. Hiller's luminous portrayal provides much of the intelligent glow of Shaw's stage comedy, as transferred compactly to the screen by Gabriel Pascal. The solid cast also includes Sybil Thorndike, Deborah Kerr and Robert Newton; the musical score is beautiful -- Sun./Early Mon. at 3 A.M., Monday at 4 P.M. and Friday at 3:30 P.M. on Bravo.</p>
        <p>Viewers unfamiliar with Richard Condon's MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962) should be totally engrossed by John Frankenheimer's devastating thriller, with Laurence Harvey, Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, Janet Leigh, James Gregory and Leslie Parrish. From its strange opening to itse shattering climax, at a Presidential political convention with a long-range marksman in the balcony, it is riveting. And Miss Lansbury, in a meaty role, is marvelous -- Thur./Early Fri. at 2 A.M. on TNT.</p>
