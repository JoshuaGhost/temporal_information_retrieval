        <p>Federal investigators have linked four of the nation's leading retailers -- Wal-Mart, Kmart, Nordstrom and the Limited -- to two Chinatown clothing factories the Government said were sweatshops that had flagrantly violated minimum-wage and overtime laws.</p>
        <p>In a news release issued Friday night, the United States Department of Labor said that manufacturers working for the retailers had contracted with the two factories to make sportswear, including Wal-Mart's Kathie Lee Gifford apparel line and Kmart's Jaclyn Smith lines.</p>

        <p>Federal investigators have linked four of the nation's leading retailers -- Wal-Mart, Kmart, Nordstrom and the Limited -- to two Chinatown clothing factories the Government said were sweatshops that had flagrantly violated minimum-wage and overtime laws.</p>
        <p>In a news release issued Friday night, the United States Department of Labor said that manufacturers working for the retailers had contracted with the two factories to make sportswear, including Wal-Mart's Kathie Lee Gifford apparel line and Kmart's Jaclyn Smith lines.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department said the two factories owed 73 workers a total of $214,000 because they had been paid piece rates, which often came to less than the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour required by law, and less than time-and-a-half for overtime.</p>
        <p>The two garment factories, both at 446 Broadway and owned by Lai Fong Yuen, are MSL Sportswear and Laura &amp; Sarah Sportswear. Even though they are unionized, the two shops have failed to pay workers regularly since August, the Labor Department said.</p>
        <p>Federal labor investigators found that the factories kept two sets of books, one with false numbers showing that they complied with wage and working-hour laws. The Labor Department fined the two factories $36,500 for keeping false books and for other violations on wages and hours.</p>
        <p>''It is unacceptable that these workers, among the most vulnerable, were forced to work without pay,'' said Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman.</p>
        <p>At the same time that Ms. Herman revealed that the four major retailers were linked to the factories, she announced that the retailers had pledged to work harder to make sure manufacturers working for them did not subcontract with sweatshops.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department said the Chinatown factories also made clothes for Nordstrom's private label, Classique Entier, and for a line called Wear It Again sold at Lerner stores, a subsidiary of the Limited.</p>
        <p>Labor Department officials said that the manufacturers working for the retailers had agreed to sign the department's monitoring compliance agreement. That agreement requires manufacturers and their contractors to systematically monitor subcontractors for compliance with minimum-wage, overtime and child labor laws. The agreement also calls on manufacturers to guarantee payment of back wages when the contractors they use violate wage and hour laws.</p>
        <p>Nordstrom's co-president, Erik Nordstrom, said in a statement, ''We want to do the right thing, and we expect our vendors to respect and obey the law. We take this violation by our vendor very seriously and have enhanced our private-label compliance efforts so that we do our part to stop labor abuses.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the State Attorney General's office charged Ms. Yuen with two misdemeanors for failing to pay her workers properly.The trial is scheduled for Jan. 28. Ms. Yuen's lawyer, Joseph Sorrentino, said it was wrong to bring criminal charges against her just because she had had trouble making the payroll.</p>
        <p>Labor Department officials said the two Chinatown factories had been monitored, but suggested that the monitoring fell short because the owner had been given advance notice of a monitor's visit and because the monitor was unable to interview the workers in their native languages.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department said the four retailers had sent messages to the firms that oversee their work, stressing the importance of doing unannounced monitoring and having translators on hand.</p>
        <p>The department said it had restored $50,000 in back wages to the workers, and planned to restore an additional $45,000 in the near future.</p>
        <p>Several of the manufacturers that used the factories agreed to pay some of the back wages.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department initiated court action against Fashion Headquarters, because it failed to cooperate in providing information about its retailers and had refused to refrain from shipping its ''hot goods.'' That term is used for goods made in violation of wage-and-hour laws.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 26, a Federal judge issued an injunction barring Fashion Headquarters from shipping those goods.</p>
