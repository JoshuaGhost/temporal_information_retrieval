        <p>As the national debate over affirmative action intensifies, most Americans today endorse the goal of racial diversity in schools and offices, but reject some of the main methods used so far to achieve it, according to a New York Times/CBS News Poll.</p>
        <p>In a survey marked by ambivalence and tangled views, a majority of Americans did not want to end affirmative action immediately, as many politicians have proposed, but did oppose the idea of making hiring and admissions decisions based on race.</p>
        <p>Even as they criticized preferences based on race and gender, however, Americans seemed eager to support affirmative action based on economic class. Majorities of both blacks and whites said they favored policies that give specific preferential treatment in college admissions and employment to people from poor families over those from middle-class or rich families.</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is consistent with a decade of previous polling on this issue. When the Times/CBS survey first began asking about racial preferences in 1985, Americans were evenly divided. But opinion turned overwhelmingly against racial preferences in the late 1980's, was particularly hostile toward them in the recessionary years of the early 1990's and has remained negative ever since.</p>
        <p>The new poll also highlights the political land mines around this issue. Opponents of affirmative action are aggressively promoting measures in state legislatures and in referendum efforts that would ban the practice. But in general, the survey suggests that Americans are not so much inclined to abolish affirmative action as to search for a new but elusive middle ground.</p>
        <p>Many people of both races said they were uncomfortable with the ways that affirmative action had been made into such a divisive matter, and they often tended to fault politicians for drumming the issue. Black respondents, however, were more likely to say that affirmative action was needed to redress bias in society, while whites were more likely to say that banning it was a positive step toward eliminating that bias.</p>
        <p>''The whole issue is just another wedge tool used by the politicians,'' said Sylvester Haywood, 43, an insurance broker in Gary, Ind., who is black. ''If everything was truly equal, if people could deal with each other on a rational level rather than on whims and emotions, of course, we wouldn't need affirmative action. But it's not.''</p>
        <p>But Barbara Elias-Baker, 51, a retired research chemist in San Francisco, who is white, said that while she supports ''an extra effort in providing training programs for minorities,'' she believes that preferences based on race are divisive and unfair. ''Quotas are not the way to deal with the problem of unemployment in minority neighborhoods,'' Ms. Elias-Baker said. ''I've seen several cases where promotions were given to a Hispanic or a black and the candidates were on equal footing.''</p>
        <p>Both black and white Americans say that diversity is important in the nation's universities and workplaces and that they favor ''special efforts'' to help racial minorities compete. But asked if they supported policies that offer specific preference to qualified applicants based on skin color, strong majorities of whites said no, while the opinions of blacks varied significantly depending on how the question was phrased.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the modern politics of race, the survey did not find wide differences in attitudes toward ending affirmative action based on what region people lived in. But it did find differences based on education and income. For instance, whites with a college degree were more likely to favor abolishing affirmative action (by a margin of 57 percent to 34 percent) than those with a high school degree or less (31 percent favor abolishing, 51 percent oppose). Similarly, those with annual incomes above $50,000 were much more likely to favor abolishing affirmative action than those who make $30,000 a year or less.</p>
        <p>The Times/CBS poll, a nationwide telephone survey of 1,258 adults, was conducted Dec. 6 to 9. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p>
        <p>The poll results also indicate that the issue of affirmative action, much like abortion, is particularly sensitive to semantics.</p>
        <p>Black and white respondents tended to give similar answers to a hypothetical question about college admissions, in which a school can choose only one candidate between white and black applicants who are equally qualified. Asked whether the black applicant should be admitted to help achieve more racial balance in the college, clear majorities of both races -- 69 percent of whites and 63 percent of blacks -- said no, that race should not be a factor in the decision.</p>
        <p>But there was a wide disparity between the races on a related question: ''Do you believe that where there has been job discrimination against blacks in the past, preference in hiring or promotion should be given to blacks today?'' Whites still said no to this question, by a margin of 57 percent to 31 percent. But 62 percent of blacks answered yes, while 23 percent said no.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, strong majorities of both races said they would favor ''special educational programs to assist minorities in competing for college admissions.''</p>
        <p>Recent referendums have also offered contradictory readings on the public mood, and differences in wording may be at least partly responsible. In California last year, voters approved a measure banning the practice, in an initiative that was couched in language making any sort of ''preferential treatment'' in state-sponsored programs illegal. But in Houston last month, voters decisively said no when they were simply asked whether they wished to end the city's affirmative action programs in city hiring and contracting.</p>
        <p>With some minor exceptions, the latest Times/CBS poll showed that respondents generally described their views about affirmative action programs intended to help women in the same way that they described programs based on race.</p>
        <p>Three Questions, Complex Views</p>
        <p>The complexity of views on affirmative action seemed particularly evident in a series of three questions in the poll that all began with the phrase, ''In order to make up for past discrimination,'' and went on to ask respondents their views on particular policies.</p>
        <p>For example, asked their views on programs that ''give preferential treatment to racial minorities,'' only 26 percent -- including 21 percent of whites and 51 percent of blacks -- said they would favor such programs. Just 19 percent -- 15 percent of whites and 48 percent of blacks -- said they would favor programs that ''impose quotas for racial minorities.''</p>
        <p>But asked their views about programs that ''make special efforts to help minorities get ahead,'' Americans of both races seemed vastly more comfortable with this vaguer language. Fifty-five percent of the respondents, including 50 percent of whites and 80 percent of blacks, said they would favor such programs.</p>
        <p>What, exactly, does ''special efforts'' mean? Follow-up interviews conducted after the poll with many of the respondents indicated that there was no consensus on this question. But in general Americans seem to feel that any kind of education or training programs that help to get people to the same place in some mythical ''starting line'' are good, while anything that gives one group a head start in the race itself is not good.</p>
        <p>''I favor perhaps making an extra effort in providing training programs in the schools for minorities to get their skills up to par so they can compete with all other ethnic groups,'' said Denise Siino, a 39-year-old freelance journalist in Santa Ana, Calif., who is white. But, she added, ''No ethnic group, including whites, should get preferential treatment in job placement or college admissions based solely on race.''</p>
        <p>Many black Americans also voiced serious qualms about preferential treatment based on race. ''You can't make up for past mistakes by making hiring preferences,'' said Ruby Hall, 59, a retired accounting technician in Forestville, Md., who is black. ''In many cases the jobs are available but people aren't qualified because of their education.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hall said she would support programs that help children who lack basic reading and writing skills reach college.</p>
        <p>''This would include special education classes or tutoring programs,'' Ms. Hall said. ''This needs to start as early as the third grade in elementary school so kids don't fall behind.''</p>
        <p>Blacks and Whites: Opinions in Contrast</p>
        <p>Still, there were often wide gaps in the ways that white and black Americans viewed affirmative action. Blacks were much more likely to support any kind of affirmative action program, and were much more likely to say that discrimination persists in the workplace and in society at large.</p>
        <p>Blacks and whites also exhibited sharply contrasting views in their responses to a question about what constitutes a bigger problem in the workplace -- blacks losing out because of racial discrimination, or whites losing out because of affirmative action.</p>
        <p>The overall pool of those surveyed was almost exactly split on the answer. But white people, by 39 percent to 31 percent, described ''whites losing out'' as the bigger problem, while black people, by 63 percent to 10 percent, said ''blacks losing out'' was a bigger issue. (Remaining numbers for both races either said both problems were equally serious or said they didn't know.)</p>
        <p>Whites were also much less likely to say that race has ever been a factor, one way or the other, in whether they got a job or promotion. Eighty-three percent of whites said they believed it simply had never been a factor for them, but blacks offered a much more textured range of answers to this question: 21 percent said their race had helped them in such a situation, 26 percent said it had hurt, 5 percent said it had helped in some cases and hurt in others and 46 percent said it had not been a factor.</p>
        <p>Among all those of both races who said they favor banning affirmative action, whites were much more likely than blacks to say they would stand by that view even if it meant fewer black professionals and university students. Given a specific example of a professional field, white people were also much less likely than blacks to say that affirmative action programs were necessary ''to make sure there are more black doctors.''</p>
        <p>Races Seem Close On Core Principles</p>
        <p>In many other ways, though, the two racial groups seemed closer on the issues than often seems to be assumed when the subject of affirmative action comes up for discussion.</p>
        <p>Both races seemed to agree on some core principles, among them that laws are still needed to protect racial minorities from discrimination, that racial diversity is an important aim, that special efforts and ''outreach programs'' to help minorities advance are acceptable and even laudable, but that specific racial preferences often are not.</p>
        <p>Blacks and whites were also much more likely to say that, in general, white applicants for schools and jobs win out over equally qualified black applicants and that white people have a better chance of getting ahead in society than black people do.</p>
        <p>And, given a more open-ended way to explain their views on affirmative action than a straight favor-or-oppose question, Americans of both races would seem to agree that the programs need to be preserved in some fashion.</p>
        <p>Asked what society should do with ''affirmative action programs giving preference to some minorities,'' people were much more inclined to say that they should be maintained or revised than they were to say that they should be abolished.</p>
        <p>In the poll, 24 percent of respondents (21 percent of whites, 36 percent of blacks) favored leaving the programs alone, and 43 percent (41 percent of whites, 56 percent of blacks) favored changing them. But only 25 percent (30 percent of whites and 3 percent of blacks) said they would ''do away'' with such programs.</p>
        <p>Similarly, despite the vote in California that basically asked whether affirmative action should be banned immediately, respondents in the poll seemed much more comfortable with a more amorphous option.</p>
        <p>Asked whether affirmative action programs should be ended now, phased out or continued, just 12 percent of those polled -- 13 percent of whites and less than 1 percent of blacks -- said they should be ended now. Forty percent (45 percent of whites, 17 percent of blacks) favored phasing out the programs, and 41 percent (35 percent of whites, 80 percent of blacks) said they should be continued.</p>
        <p>The poll focused on the attitudes of white and black Americans and, while members of other minority groups were surveyed, their numbers were not large enough to provide a statistically reliable snapshot of the attitudes of Hispanic and Asian Americans.</p>
        <p>How the Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 6-9 with 1,258 adults throughout the United States.</p>
        <p>The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 36,000 active residential exchanges across the country.</p>
        <p>Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the survey.</p>
        <p>Black Americans and residents of California were sampled at somewhat higher than normal rates in order to facilitate analysis of these groups, and were then weighted back to their proper proportion of the overall population.</p>
        <p>The results have also been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, age and education.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults.</p>
        <p>For smaller subgroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, for blacks taken as a group it is plus or minus seven percentage points.</p>
        <p>There were insufficient Asian or Hispanic respondents in the poll to separate out either of those groups' views with confidence.</p>
        <p>In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. Variations in question wording or the order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.</p>
