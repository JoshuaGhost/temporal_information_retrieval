        <p>Boxed sets were once among a music fan's most prized possessions -- beautifully packaged, exhaustively chronicled career retrospectives. But nowadays the sets have become almost as commonplace as albums, with young bands putting them out after only a few releases, older musicians boasting as many as five, and others compiling them on a single theme. With the gift-giving season upon us, here is a selection by New York Times critics. The sets average $12 to $16 per disk.</p>

        <p>''KEITH JARRETT: THE IMPULSE YEARS 1973-1974''  (Four CD's). The box collects not only four albums -- ''Fort Yawuh,'' ''Treasure Island,'' ''Death and the Flower'' and ''Backhand'' -- but also adds substantial new material. ''Fort Yawuh,'' for example, a live date from the Village Vanguard, expands to two CD's with extended solos by Jarrett and Dewey Redman on saxophone. ''Treasure Island'' augments the group of Redman, the bassist Charlie Haden and the drummer Paul Motian (with the guitarist Sam Brown on several tracks). One of the best groups of the 70's, the quartet, with added percussion, goes its distinct way.</p>
