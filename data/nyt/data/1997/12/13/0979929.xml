      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Bronx Zoo can seem empty and bleak in the winter. But this year the zoo has opened its doors at night, presenting a dazzling display of lights and animals in what could become a new holiday tradition. On a recent Saturday evening the zoo was teeming with families, their breath frosting as they passed animals real and manufactured.</p>
        <p>Nighttime zoo openings have been pioneered in Cincinnati and many other cities, but now the Bronx is adding an especially glitzy touch. Some 300,000 tiny lights have been strung along trees, across exhibition halls and around animal sculptures. You can see a herd of buffalo made up of white lights in the place where the real buffalo roam, lighted wolves howling in the night, a lighted spider monkey leaping overhead and mechanical butterflies fluttering their wings.</p>

        <p>The Bronx Zoo can seem empty and bleak in the winter. But this year the zoo has opened its doors at night, presenting a dazzling display of lights and animals in what could become a new holiday tradition. On a recent Saturday evening the zoo was teeming with families, their breath frosting as they passed animals real and manufactured.</p>
        <p>Nighttime zoo openings have been pioneered in Cincinnati and many other cities, but now the Bronx is adding an especially glitzy touch. Some 300,000 tiny lights have been strung along trees, across exhibition halls and around animal sculptures. You can see a herd of buffalo made up of white lights in the place where the real buffalo roam, lighted wolves howling in the night, a lighted spider monkey leaping overhead and mechanical butterflies fluttering their wings.</p>
        <p>Only a quarter of the zoo's 4,000 real animals are on display, most of them indoors. Outside in a temporary pen a half-dozen reindeer sat languidly, looking far too small to pull a sleigh through the air. The sullen reindeer were tethered a safe distance from each other, apparently to keep their horns from clashing. More receptive were the camels, penned nearby and nuzzling inquisitive visitors.</p>
        <p>The elephant house, its exterior sculptures gloriously illuminated, had a large Christmas tree inside, along with piles of merchandise for sale. Nearby the elephants and a lone tapir looked on indifferently at Christmas shoppers. There was something disorienting yet magical and perhaps more intimate about visiting the zoo in the dark. It was another opportunity to experience the familiar in a different way.</p>
