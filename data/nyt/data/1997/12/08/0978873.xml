        <p>Frank Foster has appeared at St. Peter's Church in his signature white suit at least 20 times, conducting his jazz band in what has become a beloved ritual. But his performance last night was distinctive because in between the raucously cheerful songs, his grandson was baptized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster, who is something of a fixture at the church's weekly jazz vespers, said he wanted his grandson, Andrew Mark Innis, to be baptized at St. Peter's because he himself has spent so many Sunday evenings playing there with his 19-piece orchestra, the Loud Minority. He chose last night because the Lutheran church was celebrating its 20th anniversary in the Citicorp Center, at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street.</p>

        <p>Frank Foster has appeared at St. Peter's Church in his signature white suit at least 20 times, conducting his jazz band in what has become a beloved ritual. But his performance last night was distinctive because in between the raucously cheerful songs, his grandson was baptized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster, who is something of a fixture at the church's weekly jazz vespers, said he wanted his grandson, Andrew Mark Innis, to be baptized at St. Peter's because he himself has spent so many Sunday evenings playing there with his 19-piece orchestra, the Loud Minority. He chose last night because the Lutheran church was celebrating its 20th anniversary in the Citicorp Center, at Lexington Avenue and 54th Street.</p>
        <p>''I consider jazz to be a gift from God,'' said Mr. Foster, 69, who played the saxophone in and eventually led the Count Basie band. ''I also consider my grandson to be that kind of gift, so it seemed right to combine the music and the baptism.''</p>
        <p>He said a former pastor asked him years ago to compose something to celebrate Advent. The result was ''The Great and Terrible Day of the Lord,'' a suite that changes every time the band plays it, he said.</p>
        <p>The major addition to yesterday's performance was the baptism of 1-year-old Andrew, who was dressed in a white suit almost identical to his grandfather's. Halfway through Mr. Foster's suite, the band leader left the front of the church and watched as the Rev. Dale R. Lind, pastor to the jazz community, doused Andrew's tiny head.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foster is among hundreds of musicians who have performed at St. Peter's jazz vespers, a Sunday service created in part to encourage more jazz musicians to explore religion. He is also one of the oldest, having performed at the vespers since 1965, the year it began. He is still friends with the Rev. John Garcia Gensel, who started the Jazz Ministry 32 years ago and retired in 1994.</p>
        <p>''When Frank performs this music,'' his wife, Cecilia, said, ''it is our highest point of worship to the Lord. Bringing our family into it takes it to a whole new level.''</p>
        <p>That level was apparently sublime enough to overwhelm Mr. Foster, at least temporarily. When the baptism was over and other family members were taking their seats, he smiled dazedly at the child until his wife nudged him back toward the band.</p>
        <p>''Oh, got to get back to the music.'' he said, scurrying back to his spot at the front of the church.</p>
