        <p>Some losses are disturbing, while others are embarrassing. The Knicks' 93-78 loss to the 76ers tonight was both.</p>
        <p>It was such a disheartening defeat that Jeff Van Gundy took the blame for the team's troubles in his post-game meeting with the the news media,  saying he had done a poor coaching job the past three months, and that the Knicks were no closer to understanding what it took to win a championship than they were at the beginning of last season.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy's comments could be interpreted as a psychological move, aimed at taking some of the pressure away from his players. Yet, it was clear that the Knicks (11-8), losing for the third time in four games, had reached a crucial point in the young season. And it was also clear that Van Gundy was in the midst of his most frustrating period since becoming the Knicks' head coach during the 1995-96 season.</p>
        <p>Playing another awful game against one of the National Basketball Association's cellar-dwellers, the Knicks were dominated by Philadelphia at the Core States Center. New York trailed by 25 points with seven minutes left, and the Knicks never seriously threatened in the second half.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Van Gundy blistered his own performance as coach of the Knicks, although his statements also reflected how poorly the players had performed.</p>
        <p>''When you look at that team out there, playing as inconsistently as it does, you have to look at one place, yourself, and that's me,'' Van Gundy said.</p>
        <p>''I think for eight years I did a good job here,'' he added, referring to his time both as an assistant coach and as head coach. ''This year, I'm doing as bad a job with a team as you could possibly do. We do not get it. We are no closer to understanding what it takes to win big in this league than we were last year at the start of the season.</p>
        <p>''A coach's job is to get his team to understand, and we do not. We make the same mistakes. We take poor shots. We rely on the jump shot to win or lose. We have good guys, so the blame is not on them, the blame is on myself. I am disgraced with myself right now that a team can play like this, time and time again. I have not gotten the job done.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy also talked about the team's problems away from Madison Square Garden. ''We're 5-7 on the road,'' he said. ''It's easy to win at home. As a coach, you get your team to play tough on the road and compete. That's pitiful on my part. We might as well be a bunch of 23- or 24-year-olds. You're only a veteran team if your experiences help you. We're making the mistakes of a young team. Only consistent teams win in this league. We would not be in the playoffs today, and rightfully so. I have done a poor coaching job with more than enough talent in that locker room.''</p>
        <p>His players responded to Van Gundy's comments by unanimously supporting his performance as coach. But Chris Childs, the backup point guard, delivered an insightful look at the Knicks' locker room, saying that leadership, or lack of it, was one of New York's problems.</p>
        <p>''We need a leader on this team, a vocal leader, someone to step up and say, 'Enough is enough,' '' Childs said. ''This is disgraceful. You look around the court, and everyone has a blank look on their faces. Everyone on this team shouldn't be able to sleep.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the Knicks were peeking ahead toward Tuesday's date in Chicago against the Bulls. Perhaps the Knicks were fatigued, playing for the third time in four days. Perhaps the Knicks underestimated the 76ers, who were coming off a big loss to the Nets.</p>
        <p>But all of those excuses were inexcusable, especially since the Knicks had just been embarrassed last Thursday, when they lost to the struggling Dallas Mavericks as Don Nelson, whom Van Gundy replaced, returned to coaching. In many ways, that effort in Dallas was a carbon copy of tonight's. The Knicks were slow getting back defensively. They were out-hustled for rebounds. They made careless passes. Instead of looking like a contender, the Knicks looked like impostors.</p>
        <p>It was so bad that Patrick Ewing (10 points) sat out the final 18 minutes, with Van Gundy deciding to save his legs for Tuesday. When Ewing did play, he was as ineffective as most of his teammates.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating and flat-out disappointing,'' Ewing said. ''This is a team we should beat.''</p>
        <p>The Sixers (5-11) deserved credit for playing an inspired game. Tormenting the Knicks as usual, Allen Iverson (27 points, 7 assists) was spectacular, lighting the match that ignited the Sixers with clever passes, crowd-pleasing moves, and drawing attention from the defense that led to wide-open shots for teammates.</p>
        <p>It was difficult for Van Gundy to survey the scene, calling timeouts that did nothing to change the momentum, plotting strategy that was futile. Van Gundy stoically sipped a Diet Pepsi in front of the Knick bench from time to time, but he probably needed a Tums.</p>
        <p>Asked about Van Gundy's post-game comments, Childs said: ''You can't blame the coaching. It ain't Jeff, it's us. He doesn't play.''</p>
        <p>After Saturday's impressive victory against Charlotte, the Knicks talked about starting a winning streak, talked about building momentum and talked about playing up to their abilities. After this performance, that talk sounded hollow.</p>
        <p>''I guess that was just talk,'' Childs said. ''We say a whole lot. We might as well have said, 'Take this game,' and gone straight to Chicago.''</p>
        <p>When training camp started, the Knicks talked as if they believed they would hit full stride once the regular season began, but that notion has not materialized. ''First we must admit we have a problem,'' said Buck Williams, the veteran forward. ''In the exhibition season, everyone was saying the problems would take care of themselves, but that didn't happen.''</p>
        <p>The game was decided in the second quarter, when Philadelphia's lead grew to 18 points, and virtually everyone on the Knicks except Allan Houston (25 points) lost his ability to score. Houston was the only Knick who scored during the first 10 minutes 25 seconds of the second quarter, and his 11 points in the period were hardly enough to keep the game close. Jerry Stackhouse (20 points) also had a solid game for Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Knicks filed out of the locker room quietly, wondering what would happen next. Maybe playing the Bulls would bring out the best of the Knicks. But playing the 76ers tonight brought out the bad.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The crowd of 20,037, boosted by a large contingent of Knicks fans, was the second straight 76ers crowd of more than 20,000 at the Core States Center. It was the first time that had happened in the team's two years in the building.</p>
