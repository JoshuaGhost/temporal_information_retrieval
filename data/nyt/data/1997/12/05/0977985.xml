        <p>The lawyer, Darryl E. Greene, is accused of submitting false bills to several city agencies that hired him as a consultant to help them comply with affirmative action guidelines, according to an indictment filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn. Among the agencies cited was the City Health and Hospitals Corporation, which had undertaken a mammoth reconstruction project at Kings County Hospital.</p>
        <p>Clarence Norman Jr., the leader of the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, is a partner in Mr. Greene's firm, Darryl E. Greene &amp; Associates.</p>
        <p>The indictment, filed Wednesday by the United States Attorney's office, charges Mr. Greene with mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Greene's lawyer, Gary P. Naftalis, maintained his client's innocence.</p>
        <p>''We expect to be completely exonerated and vindicated in trial,'' Mr. Naftalis said.</p>
