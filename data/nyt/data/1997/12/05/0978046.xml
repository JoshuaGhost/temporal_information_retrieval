        <p>Christmas albums start to trickle out around Labor Day, are flowing steadily by October and turn into a deluge in November. Like the season, the albums offer comfort and glitz, raw commercial ambition and good intentions, novelties and would-be traditions. Stars, past and present, make Christmas albums or contribute songs to compilations; some unknowns try Christmas music to get noticed. In a music business dedicated to niche marketing, seasonal albums provide sonic accessories for every attitude an executive or musician can imagine: sentimental or cynical, awestruck or earthy, aggressive or hushed. Old carols bear up under interpretations from bluegrass to punk rock; new songs aim for a quick laugh or for heartwarming durability. On this page, the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times dig into the giant pile of this year's seasonal album releases to find the most noteworthy ones. (Compact disks range in price from $15.99 to $18.)</p>

        <p>Judy Collins--</p>
        <p>''CHRISTMAS AT THE BILTMORE ESTATE'' -- (Elektra). All-out earnestness reigns on this live recording. In her reedy, tremulous soprano, Judy Collins sings a standard selection of carols and Christmas pop, along with two high-minded new songs of her own; her ''All on a Wintry Night'' has an awestruck purity. Between songs she reminisces about the Christmases of her childhood. With a children's choir, a Baroque-style trumpeter and twinkling keyboards, the performances are sweet and utterly humorless. Pop scholars will appreciate the fact that she sings introductions and all the verses to songs like ''Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.''</p>
