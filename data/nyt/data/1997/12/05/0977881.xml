      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For nearly 30 years now, Richard Foreman has built a career on inexplicable and nonsensical plays staged mostly by his Ontological-Hysteric Theater. It was disconcerting, then, to open the program to his latest concoction, ''Pearls for Pigs,'' and find that Mr. Foreman had written notes purporting to explain what actually happens in the 80 minutes of traffic on the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foreman's admirers can rest easy. The program notes are almost as dense as the ''Viennese double baloney'' (to borrow the playwright's own phrase) that serves as dialogue. ''Pearls for Pigs'' is crammed full of familiar Foreman business: beheadings, stabbings, simulated sex (fully clothed, almost prudish by today's standards), all played out on a stage decorated with shrunken skulls impaled on striped poles and littered with old newspapers.</p>

        <p>For nearly 30 years now, Richard Foreman has built a career on inexplicable and nonsensical plays staged mostly by his Ontological-Hysteric Theater. It was disconcerting, then, to open the program to his latest concoction, ''Pearls for Pigs,'' and find that Mr. Foreman had written notes purporting to explain what actually happens in the 80 minutes of traffic on the stage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foreman's admirers can rest easy. The program notes are almost as dense as the ''Viennese double baloney'' (to borrow the playwright's own phrase) that serves as dialogue. ''Pearls for Pigs'' is crammed full of familiar Foreman business: beheadings, stabbings, simulated sex (fully clothed, almost prudish by today's standards), all played out on a stage decorated with shrunken skulls impaled on striped poles and littered with old newspapers.</p>
        <p>The ostensible vehicle for this latest Foreman exploration of the human psyche (or psychosis) is an aging actor called the Maestro (David Patrick Kelly) who fears he is losing his mind by going onstage every night and so consults the Doctor (Tom Nelis).</p>
        <p>For foils there are a Pierrot (Peter Jacobs), a Columbine (Stephanie Cannon) and four male dwarfs large enough to double as the defensive line for the Green Bay Packers.</p>
        <p>But as the playwright explains in his program notes, that is simply the ''situation.'' There is no real story. What transpires is a series of loosely connected surreal skits that employ a good deal of sophomoric humor and pseudophilosophical wordplay.</p>
        <p>There are some plaintive exchanges in ''Pearls for Pigs.'' There is, for example, a defensiveness about the Maestro that reflects the difficulties faced by a writer who has striven to stay in the avant-garde for three decades.</p>
        <p>''What drives you, sir?'' the Doctor asks the Maestro at one point.</p>
        <p>''I want the world to continue,'' the Maestro replies. ''I keep things going. I say things that don't make sense. I liked it better when I had you off balance, trying to figure me out.''</p>
        <p>A bit later, the Maestro comments, ''This is the story of a man who has run out of stories.''</p>
        <p>Columbine gives him no quarter. ''Tell us another story, Maestro,'' she demands. ''Make it more powerful. Nothing is happening.''</p>
        <p>But these moments are fleeting. ''I strive to avoid consistency,'' the Maestro boasts, but Mr. Foreman's brand of theater is nothing if not consistent in its use of extremes and its attempts at outrage. There are the usual electronic sound effects, boom-box loud one moment and soft as a church choir the next; spotlights glaring in the audience's eyes one minute, then dimmed to near darkness the next; actors shouting threats from a tabletop on one page, then almost whispering on the next. There are pratfalls, sight gags and outlandish costumes. It at least keeps the audience awake.</p>
        <p>At the outset, the Maestro enters, followed by Pierrot carrying a mirror.</p>
        <p>''I hate the actors in this play,'' the Maestro announces.</p>
        <p>Pierrot demurs. ''I rather like the actors,'' he says. ''What I hate is the play.''</p>
        <p>While it would be churlish to subscribe to such a negative view of a show whose worst fault is that it is often boring, Pierrot is right about the performances. Mr. Foreman has a good cast, and he moves them smartly through a difficult staging and intricate blocking without a hesitation or misstep.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly is energetic as the Maestro and plays the part as though he understands all the nonsense he says.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cannon is especially strong as Columbine, and Mr. Nelis is suitably wacky as the Doctor.</p>
        <p>PEARLS FOR PIGS</p>

Lighting by Heather Carson; assistant set designer, Dawn Robyn Petrlik; assistant costume designer, Mary Myers; production stage manager, Lisa Porter; assistant director, Sophie Haviland.
