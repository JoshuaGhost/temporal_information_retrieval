        <p>Federal authorities said last night that paint chips said to be from two Rembrandt paintings stolen from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston in 1990 were ''not what they purport to be.''</p>
        <p>Photographs purporting to show the missing originals were actually photographs of photographs, or of a print, and were also not genuine, the authorities said without commenting further.</p>
        <p>The photographs and paint chips were provided over several months by William P. Youngworth 3d, an antiques dealer now in jail on other charges, in support of claims that he and an imprisoned associate, Myles J. Connor Jr., who said they knew the whereabouts of the stolen works and could restore them in exchange for amnesty and the $5 million reward posted by the museum.</p>
        <p>A reporter for the Boston Herald, Tom Mashberg, had written that he was directed to a warehouse by Mr. Youngworth and shown what appeared to be some of the stolen Rembrandts, including ''Storm on the Sea of Galilee'' and ''Gentleman and a Lady in Black.''</p>
        <p>The missing works also include a Vermeer and other masterpieces valued by the F.B.I. at $300 million.</p>
        <p>In a separate statement, the Gardner museum said that analysis by its chief conservator, Barbara Mangum, determined that the paint chips were not from the Rembrandts.</p>
        <p>Whether the paint chips may have come from another of the missing works was not addressed.</p>
