        <p>For club owners, Christmas really comes on New Year's Eve. That's when bars are packed, seats are full and would-be revelers still clamor at the door. All of those clubgoers are intent on starting the year with music they love in a crowd of fellow fans. Whether they're fond of rockabilly or hip-hop, swing or salsa or electronica, they can find what they're looking for in Manhattan on New Year's Eve. Places that regularly present live music call on their favorite acts, and many places that don't still find room to set up musicians and sound systems. Obeying the law of supply and demand, prices go up -- way up -- on New Year's Eve, though most clubs offer little extras like party hats or a glass of champagne at midnight. For New Year's Eve, it's smart to make reservations or buy advance tickets; clubs do fill up, and some events (like Phish's annual show at Madison Square Garden) are already sold out. Below, the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times preview the live music taking place on New Year's Eve. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
