        <p>Saying that George Steinbrenner had made a grave mistake by dismissing him as Hideki Irabu's translator last Friday, Kota Ishijima insisted yesterday that the Japanese pitcher would be lost without him next season.</p>
        <p>''The fact that they fired me means they're sticking it in Irabu's face,'' Ishijima said. ''It's not a threat, but this is Steinbrenner telling him things aren't going to be the same and his privileges aren't going to be there. I talked to Hideki and he's wondering how he's going to get around without me.''</p>

        <p>Ishijima said Mark Newman, the vice president for player development, told him he had been dismissed for budgetary reasons. The Yankees said they are still deciding on a replacement.</p>
