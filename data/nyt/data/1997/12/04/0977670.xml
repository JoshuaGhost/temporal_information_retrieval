        <p>Editorial hails financial bailout of South Korea; deplores secrecy surrounding details (M)</p>

        <p>With South Korea's plummeting currency and rising bankruptcies threatening to spread financial turmoil to Japan, Russia and beyond, Washington wisely added up to $5 billion of its own to yesterday's international bailout of Korea. The $55 billion package, put together by the International Monetary Fund, is large enough to stanch further contagion and presumably comes with strict conditions calculated to keep South Korea out of trouble.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the details of the deal are secret, and may remain so at the discretion of the Koreans. The secrecy has already bred suspicion that the monetary fund has cracked down needlessly hard. Some initial reports, for instance, suggest that it has forced South Korea to cut its projected growth rate in half, as if slow growth were itself a virtue. More likely, the fund recognized that interest rates have to rise in Korea to stop the widespread flight from its currency. Higher rates, in turn, discourage investment and slow the economy. The fund probably insisted that Korea let these necessary corrections run their course.</p>

        <p>With South Korea's plummeting currency and rising bankruptcies threatening to spread financial turmoil to Japan, Russia and beyond, Washington wisely added up to $5 billion of its own to yesterday's international bailout of Korea.

        <p>Unfortunately, the details of the deal are secret, and may remain so at the discretion of the Koreans. The secrecy has already bred suspicion that the monetary fund has cracked down needlessly hard. Some initial reports, for instance, suggest that it has forced South Korea to cut its projected growth rate in half, as if slow growth were itself a virtue. More likely, the fund recognized that interest rates have to rise in Korea to stop the widespread flight from its currency. Higher rates, in turn, discourage investment and slow the economy. The fund probably insisted that Korea let these necessary corrections run their course.</p>
        <p>The monetary fund would be mistaken to push down much harder. Unlike Thailand earlier this year and Mexico in 1995, South Korea is not running large fiscal deficits or trade imbalances. It does not have to rein in reckless policies. South Korea's problem is almost entirely in its private sector, specifically banks that have borrowed abroad to make loans, under political pressure, to government-coddled conglomerates. The system has unraveled as financial turmoil in other parts of Asia has cut purchases of Korea's exports. As the export-dependent and heavily indebted conglomerates stumbled, depositors and foreign lenders became alarmed and withdrew their money. Even good banks have been forced to dump assets in a desperate attempt to pay off frightened depositors and foreign creditors. Korea is suffering a self-fueling crisis of confidence that threatens to bury its banks and their customers.</p>
        <p>After prolonged negotiations, the monetary fund got South Korea to agree to close insolvent banks and, like America in the 1980's, use public money to help solvent banks get through this difficult period. The longer-term answer is to free Korean companies to seek loans from abroad and, even better, equity from foreign shareholders. That way financial calculation can replace cronyism.</p>
        <p>It is hard to justify the tradition of secrecy in monetary fund bailouts when tens of billions of dollars are involved, all of it raised in one way or another from taxpayers in America and other nations. The potential embarrassment to South Korea of disclosing the terms of this package is easily outweighed by the need to know what the fund has extracted for its investment. If the terms are tough but reasonable, South Korea, with a well-trained work force and robust rates of saving and investment, should soon return to rapid growth.</p>
