        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''In Poll, Americans Reject Means but Not Ends of Racial Diversity'' (front page, Dec. 14): Attacks on affirmative action also imperil efforts to expand opportunities for women. Women's stake in this debate must not be overlooked.</p>
        <p>The task of opening doors -- whether to entry-level jobs or executive suites -- is far from finished. Whether they graduate from high school, college or law school, women still receive less pay and fewer opportunities for advancement than male colleagues of equal standing.</p>
        <p>Too many employers still question whether a woman will be as committed to her job as a man, whether she can be as strong a leader or as competent a technician. Affirmative action is about challenging decision makers who favor connections, stereotypes and familiarity over merit.</p>
