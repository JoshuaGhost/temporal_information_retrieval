        <p>As Hollywood megafilms go, ''Amistad'' has to be considered a step forward. It's about slavery, not exploding volcanoes or rampaging raptors.</p>
        <p>But it's important to remember that it's historical fiction, based on the actual story of Africans who seized control of a Cuban slave ship in 1839 and of their courtroom struggle for freedom. The film is by no means a work of history, and it is certainly not appropriate for use in the classroom.</p>

        <p>As Hollywood megafilms go, ''Amistad'' has to be considered a step forward. It's about slavery, not exploding volcanoes or rampaging raptors.</p>
        <p>But it's important to remember that it's historical fiction, based on the actual story of Africans who seized control of a Cuban slave ship in 1839 and of their courtroom struggle for freedom. The film is by no means a work of history, and it is certainly not appropriate for use in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, a learning kit has been distributed to high school and college teachers, encouraging them to do just that. The study guide erases the distinction between fact and fabrication, urging students, for example, to study the film's ''composite'' character Theodore Joadson (an antislavery printer played by Morgan Freeman) rather than real African-Americans on whom he is based.</p>
        <p>The learning kit claims that the Supreme Court's decision to free the Africans aboard the Amistad was a ''turning point in the struggle to end slavery in the United States.''</p>
        <p>The truth is that the Amistad case revolved around the Atlantic slave trade -- outlawed by international treaty long before 1840 -- and had nothing to do with slavery in this country. In the study guide, students are not told that in the 19th century it was perfectly possible to condemn the importation of slaves from Africa while simultaneously defending slavery and the flourishing slave trade in America.</p>
        <p>The learning kit suggests that the Supreme Court was moved to a new recognition of human rights by John Quincy Adams's impassioned plea on behalf of the slaves. But a majority of the Amistad Justices were still on the Court in 1857 when it ruled in the Dred Scott decision that blacks had ''no rights which a white man is bound to respect.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, any study of the Amistad case must be balanced with accounts of other historical events. In October 1841, for instance, American slaves on the slave ship Creole killed some of the crew and forced the rest to sail to the Bahamas. For 15 years, the United States unsuccessfully badgered British authorities for return of the blacks, because they were murderers and the property of American citizens. This was typical of the Government's stance toward slavery.</p>
        <p>The most galling assumption by the film's producers, however, is that a subject does not exist until Hollywood discovers it. The guide ends with a quote from the film's producer, Debbie Allen, condemning historians for having ''castrated'' the ''real history'' of African-Americans and slavery.</p>
        <p>Historians may be guilty of many sins, but ignoring slavery is not one of them. Ever since the publication of Kenneth Stampp's great work ''The Peculiar Institution'' in 1956, no subject has received more scholarly attention. History textbooks today include extensive treatments of slavery, almost always emphasizing its the system's brutality and the heroism of those who survived -- the very things Ms. Allen claims have been suppressed.</p>
        <p>''Amistad'' is an interesting historical film, but not in the way its producers intended. ''Amistad,'' like other films, tells us more about the time in which it was produced than the event that it tries to portray.</p>
        <p>''Birth of a Nation'' revealed more about the racial prejudices of 1916 than the Civil War; Oliver Stone's ''J.F.K.'' reflected post-Watergate anti-government sensibilities. ''Amistad'' portrays white abolitionists in a highly unflattering manner -- they're self-righteous and hypocritical. In this way, the film reflects today's cynicism about broad social movements. In fact, the abolitionists were largely responsible for winning freedom for those aboard the Amistad.</p>
        <p>If the film's producers really want to promote an understanding of slavery, they should direct students to the local library, where they will find several shelves of books on slavery and slave resistance.</p>
        <p>Indeed, maybe some of the money ''Amistad'' earns could be donated to our public libraries.</p>
