        <p>At 3:15 yesterday afternoon, Sammy and Roman Lopez's less-than-whirlwind tour of midtown, now well into its fourth hour, was going great. They had seen Radio City, Times Square and, of course, the Tree. And they had not even got out of the car yet.</p>
        <p>''She's never been to the city before,'' Mr. Lopez, 33, shouted over the blare of horns at Fifth Avenue and 52d Street as a day of detours and widely scattered gridlock provided the couple with a quintessential New York experience.</p>

        <p>At 3:15 yesterday afternoon, Sammy and Roman Lopez's less-than-whirlwind tour of midtown, now well into its fourth hour, was going great. They had seen Radio City, Times Square and, of course, the Tree. And they had not even got out of the car yet.</p>
        <p>''She's never been to the city before,'' Mr. Lopez, 33, shouted over the blare of horns at Fifth Avenue and 52d Street as a day of detours and widely scattered gridlock provided the couple with a quintessential New York experience.</p>
        <p>While yesterday's sea of traffic may have left the Lopezes, from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., plenty of time to sightsee out the windows of their rented car, it was a nightmare for hundreds of thousands of other motorists. With the convergence of a Presidential visit, holiday shoppers, matinee buses, the Madison Avenue closing and alternating bouts of rain, sleet and snow, traffic snarled from Columbus Circle to the Empire State Building and along much of Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.</p>
        <p>All across midtown Manhattan, anxious drivers navigated a labyrinth marked off by blue police barriers. Jockeying truck drivers stopped their rigs in the middle of Broadway to exchange punches. On Third Avenue, a police highway patrol mobile command bus changed lanes and sent a bicyclist diving for safety.</p>
        <p>Although hundreds of police officers above and beyond the normal holiday complement kept traffic, if not flowing freely, at least crawling steadily on some streets, there was still more than enough congestion to go around.</p>
        <p>''One of the toughest things with traffic here is that it's like a delicately balanced ecosystem,'' said Inspector James F. McShane, the executive officer of the Police Department's traffic control division. ''One little thing will cause chaos over a large area.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, there were several big things affecting the ecosystem. President Clinton, after an appearance in the Bronx, had lunch at the Waldorf-Astoria at Park Avenue and 51st Street, forcing the police to block off several streets. Three blocks away from the Waldorf, Madison Avenue was closed between 52d and 55th Streets for the fourth day, as workers continued to repair the office building at 540 Madison Avenue, the south wall of which had partly collapsed on Sunday, raining down debris into the street.</p>
        <p>Add in the usual litany of little things -- a construction carting truck running out of gas and blocking two lanes of traffic at Broadway and 52d Street, a limousine driver on the Avenue of the Americas who locked his keys in the car in a bus lane, construction crews violating the holiday-season moratorium on nonemergency street repairs -- and, the inspector said, ''you've got a mess.''</p>
        <p>''Forty-five minutes, six blocks,'' Terry White, 34, of Hackensack, N.J., declared when he got to 51st and Fifth. Mr. White knew he was in for trouble when he decided to ignore traffic reports and take his cousin into the city for a job interview, but he had not expected this. ''This is very, very bad,'' he said. ''It's horrible.''</p>
        <p>Still, seasoned traffic observers said things could have been a lot worse.</p>
        <p>''Today is actually not as bad as Monday,'' said Abner Rivera as he steered his Madison Avenue city bus onto the detour at 52d Street. ''I think once people found out that the President's going to be in town, and with Madison Avenue already being closed, they decided to leave their vehicles home. Which is a good idea.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it helped to have lowered expectations about the traffic.</p>
        <p>''On 57th,'' Mr. Rivera said, ''to get from Third to Madison took me 10, 15 minutes,'' a speed of about 2 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>''It's not too bad,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To the extent that traffic has been flowing this season, Inspector McShane credited the Police Department's holiday traffic safety plan, which emphasizes encouraging people to take mass transit, stationing officers in intersections to avert gridlock and giving zero tolerance to scofflaws.</p>
        <p>In the 10 days after Thanksgiving, he said, officers in midtown wrote 11,070 parking summonses, 2,123 moving violations and 10,092 taxi violations, and had 565 cars towed. ''That's a lot,'' the inspector said, though he was not sure what typical totals for a 10-day nonholiday period would be.</p>
        <p>Surveying the scene from his car at 44th and Broadway, Inspector McShane even allowed himself a moment of satisfaction. ''Given all these factors, given the time of year, and the things that are going on,'' he said, ''we're looking pretty good.''</p>
