        <p>The case of former Foreign Minister Ibrahim Yazdi of Iran, who has been held there without charges since his arrest on Dec. 14, is developing into a major test of strength between supporters and opponents of Iran's new reform-minded President.</p>
        <p>''The charges are not clear, but we have been told that he insulted the supreme leader,'' Seyed Ahmad Sadr, a lawyer for Mr. Yazdi, said in a telephone interview. ''We were not told what the insult was.''</p>
        <p>Under Iran's political system, President Mohammed Khatami, who was elected in May, has limited authority. Ultimate power rests with the supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Iran has been shaken by a series of conflicts between supporters of the two men. The key issue is whether Ayatollah Khamenei's power should be curbed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yazdi, 67, who for more than 15 years has been one of Iran's few active dissidents, has publicly supported efforts to strengthen the presidency and weaken Ayatollah Khamenei's power. He recently found an ally in Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri, with whom he worked in the months after the Islamic revolution of 1979.</p>
        <p>After Ayatollah Montazeri made a speech last month urging that the power of the country's Shiite Muslim hierarchy be reduced, conservatives ransacked his religious school in the holy city of Qum and assaulted several of his supporters in Teheran. Later Mr. Yazdi and more than 50 other Iranians signed an open letter condemning the attacks and demanding that Ayatollah Montazeri be protected.</p>
        <p>At a debate in Parliament on Monday, conservative members asserted that Mr. Yazdi and Ayatollah Montazeri were working together to undermine Islamic rule.</p>
        <p>A letter was published on Tuesday in the Teheran newspaper Salam asking why Mr. Yazdi had been arrested only moments after President Khatami had held a news conference to mark the end of a summit conference of Islamic leaders.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mr. Khatami reiterated his support for political liberalization.</p>
        <p>''Yazdi's arrest needs to be justified,'' the newspaper said in reply to the reader's question. ''Perhaps the prosecutors had justifiable reasons for their acts but chose for some reason not to disclose them. But they must take into consideration that this will have a negative repercussion after the positive achievements of the summit and the press conference. Wouldn't it have been better if they had delayed the arrest? The prosecutors should explain and give a convincing answer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Yazdi, who has described himself as a ''modernist intellectual Muslim,'' has for years functioned on the outer edge of legality. His Freedom Movement of Iran is banned and may not hold meetings or publish a newspaper, but he often speaks in public and to foreign visitors, using terms that few if any other Iranians dare to use in public.</p>
        <p>He has evidently been protected by the fact that he was a close ally of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the 1979 revolution, and held high Government posts while Ayatollah Khomeini was alive. Earlier this year he announced his candidacy for President, but the ruling mullahs refused to allow him on the ballot, so he supported Mr. Khatami.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yazdi was a student leader during the leftist Government of Mohammed Mossadegh, which was overthrown in a C.I.A.-backed coup in 1953. After the coup he worked with underground groups dedicated to overthrowing the newly installed Shah, Mohammed Riza Pahlevi.</p>
        <p>He was arrested and beaten several times by the Shah's police, and in 1960 he fled to the United States. He became a professor of pharmacy at Fairleigh Dickinson University in New Jersey and later did postdoctoral work in molecular genetics at Baylor University in Texas.</p>
        <p>During the 1970's Mr. Yazdi gravitated toward Ayatollah Khomeini, the fiery cleric who was then gathering momentum behind his movement to overthrow the Shah. In 1977 the Shah's Government tried Mr. Yazdi in absentia and sentenced him to a 10-year prison term. He lived with Ayatollah Khomeini in France and was aboard the plane that carried the Ayatollah triumphantly back to Teheran in February 1979 after the Shah had been overthrown.</p>
        <p>After serving briefly as Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Yazdi was named Foreign Minister, but he soon resigned to protest the seizure of the American Embassy in Teheran and the taking of American diplomats as hostages. Later he served in the first revolutionary Parliament.</p>
        <p>''Our party was one of the pioneers of the revolution,'' he said in a long interview at his Teheran office in May. ''We considered ourselves engineers of the revolution.''</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Yazdi criticized what he called ''the constant violations of the right of political parties to organize and continual suppression of the political rights of our people.''</p>
        <p>Asked about his plans, Mr. Yazdi said: ''We completely reject the idea of subversion. We advocate legal, overt political struggle for gradual changes. We do believe strongly in the aspirations of the revolution, but we have opposed some people and deeds connected to the Government.</p>
        <p>''This chapter of our history, the revolutionary chapter, is not concluded. Nobody can say for sure what will be the conclusion of the 1979 revolution. I don't have a date, but this will be a democratic society sooner or later.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he felt safe making such statements, he replied: ''Not very much, but we feel this is our country, and no one can claim to be more revolutionary or Islamic than I am. I stay inside the country in order to say these things.''</p>
