        <p>A woman who was injured when balloons went out of control at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade has regained consciousness after having spent nearly a month in a coma, her lawyer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The woman, Kathleen Caronna, 34, of Manhattan, has been moved out of the intensive-care unit of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center and is listed in serious but stable condition. Mrs. Caronna is able to follow simple commands, and is starting to make eye contact with visitors, the lawyer, John Quinlan Kelly, said.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 27, Mrs. Caronna suffered a severe head wound when the six-story-tall Cat in the Hat balloon struck a lamppost at 72d Street and Central Park West, causing the horizontal metal arm of the lamppost to break and raining debris on spectators.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Caronna, the mother of an 8-month-old, Alessandro, was hit moments after she had handed the child to her husband, Massimo.</p>
        <p>The hospital and Mrs. Caronna's doctors declined to comment and would not confirm that her condition had improved.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Caronna's coma began to ease on Sunday, Mr. Kelly said, adding: ''She is able to follow simple commands and she is starting to make eye contact. She has also smiled and recognized people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Caronna declined to comment, referring questions to Mr. Kelly. ''The family is cautiously optimistic,'' the lawyer said, ''that there has been some progress and some communication and recognition from Kathleen at this point.''</p>
        <p>The family has not sued Macy's, and Mr. Kelly would not say whether a suit would be filed. After the accident, Mr. Kelly criticized Macy's for not expressing enough concern about Mrs. Caronna's injury.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the department store, Ronnie Taffet, said yesterday, ''We went to the hospital directly from the parade to show our concern for Kathy and her family and to offer any assistance.''</p>
        <p>In a statement yesterday, Macy's said, ''We are happy to hear this latest news of Kathy Caronna's condition and, as always, our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Caronna family, especially for Kathy, to whom we wish a speedy and full recovery.''</p>
        <p>The balloon injured three other spectators, and at least one, Maria Clohessy, 45, of Pearl River, N.Y., has hired a law firm to sue Macy's. Mrs. Clohessy, a mother of three, was also struck by debris.</p>
        <p>After the accident, a group of city officials was convened to investigate the incident. Since then, a steady crowd of family and friends has headed to St. Luke's to visit Mrs. Caronna. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has visited her several times, including as recently as Saturday.</p>
