        <p>U.C.L.A. 96, RUTGERS 93</p>
        <p>Melanie Pearson scored 26 points, including 10 in overtime, to lead U.C.L.A. to a 96-93 victory over Rutgers last night in the Pac-10/Big East Challenge at Pauley Pavilion.</p>
        <p>Pearson dominated the extra period, scoring 8 of U.C.L.A.'s first 10 points, including two 3-pointers that made it 84-79. Later, two free throws by Tawana Grimes with 11 seconds to play gave the Bruins a 3-point cushion.</p>
        <p>With a minute to play in the second half, Rutgers led by 74-70 until a Maylana Martin layup and two free throws by Tawana Grimes tied it at 74-74. Rutgers guard Natasha Pointer had a chance to take the lead, but she missed two free throws with 22 seconds to play in regulation, pushing the game into overtime.</p>
        <p>The Bruins were down by 16 points with less than two minutes to play in the first half, but a 3-pointer by Erica Gomez sparked a 7-0 U.C.L.A. run to make it 43-34.</p>
        <p>Pointer scored a game-high 33 points and 12 rebounds, both career bests.</p>
        <p>Martin added 24 points and 8 rebounds for U.C.L.A.</p>
        <p>FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL 80, PITTSBURGH 65</p>
        <p>Dalma Ivanyi had 23 points and 10 assists as No. 24 Florida International remained undefeated by beating slumping Pittsburgh last night in the opening round of the Holiday Classic in Miami.</p>
        <p>Reserve Zuzana Michalcova added 15 points and 10 rebounds to help tournament host F.I.U.</p>
        <p>F.I.U. (7-0) led by 34-24 at intermission, and never trailed in the second half. The loss was the fifth in a row for Pittsburgh (2-6).</p>
        <p>F.I.U. is having its best start in Division I, and third best in the school's history. F.I.U. started out 8-0 in 1982 and 10-0 in 1985.</p>
