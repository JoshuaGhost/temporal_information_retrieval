        <p>Aleksei Kovalev doesn't quite speak in the past tense, but there's a wistful quality in his voice when he talks about his career with the Rangers.</p>
        <p>He longs to return to the days when he was regarded as an important player, when he knew how much he would play and what was expected of him. ''One day it will happen,'' Kovalev said.</p>
        <p>But it is appearing more and more likely that day won't come with the Rangers.</p>
        <p>Kovalev's immediate future remained the subject of considerable speculation as the National Hockey League trade embargo lifted at midnight last night. And his performance Friday night against the Buffalo Sabres did little to quiet those rumors. The gifted though enigmatic wing played just 10 shifts in the Rangers' 3-0 loss to the Sabres after he was a healthy scratch against Tampa Bay last Tuesday. He has now gone nine games without a goal after opening the season with an 18-game goal-less drought.</p>
        <p>Before the embargo went into place, published reports had Kovalev going to Vancouver or Carolina. On Friday night, the Edmonton Oilers and the Detroit Red Wings both had two scouts in Buffalo. Those are the classic portents of a trade, perhaps for Jason Arnott, a talented, but disappointing, player for the Oilers. And Kovalev is aware his days with the Rangers may be numbered.</p>
        <p>''If it happens, it happens,'' he said. ''I'm still a Ranger. I do what I have to do to help win games. It would definitely be nice to go back to that time when I had the opportunity to play a lot and enjoy myself.</p>
        <p>''I have a different time now. I feel like '92-93 when I first came here. I was traveling back and forth from the minors, and didn't know where I'd be the next day. That's the way I feel now. I want to get back to the point where I was the kind of player who can help the team win games and do a lot of good things for the team.''</p>
        <p>Rangers General Manager Neil Smith said he did not conduct any trade talks during the weeklong holiday embargo. When asked to comment on Kovalev's status with the team, Smith said: ''I hope he gets straightened out. I've been with him for five years and I want to stick with him. I'm hoping.''</p>
        <p>Smith is nothing if not patient.</p>
        <p>Kovalev is now in his sixth season with the Rangers. He has dazzling individual skills and seemingly has the ability to become a star in the N.H.L. But, for all that talent, his career is still measured in nebulous terms like potential. The more concrete data, goals and assists, suggest Kovalev is an average N.H.L. player.</p>
        <p>In five seasons with the Rangers, Kovalev, a native of Togliatti in Russia, has yet to produce a 25-goal campaign or 60 points. The highlight of his Rangers' career was the '94 Stanley Cup run when he produced 9 goals and 21 points in the playoffs. That was supposed to be Kovalev's coming-out party. Instead, he followed it with 13 goals in the lockout-shortened 1994-95 season, 24 goals in 1995-96 and 13 in an injury-plagued 1996-97.</p>
        <p>In those bygone years, the Rangers had the offensive depth to hide Kovalev's spotty contributions. Adam Graves was a more consistent point producer. Mark Messier was still with the team. But this year the offense has dried up. And Kovalev is a big part of the problem.</p>
        <p>''Right now I'm trying to do my best,'' Kovalev said. ''I have one shift, two shifts a period.</p>
        <p>''I never give up on myself. I'm still young. There are a lot of years left. I'm still a good player. You have to believe in yourself. One day it will happen and I'll be better for it.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Having just been called up to help the moribund Ranger offense, center MARC SAVARD was reassigned Saturday to Hartford.</p>
