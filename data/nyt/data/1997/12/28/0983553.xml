        <p>WHAT would I like to start off the New Year? Caviar, white truffles, smoked salmon and champagne.</p>
        <p>Blinis with caviar is one of my favorite dishes either for brunch or a light supper. These Russian pancakes are made with yeast and buckwheat flour, wrapped in a napkin and served with as much caviar as can be afforded, along with small bowls of melted butter and sour cream.</p>
        <p>They are also good with salmon roe (which is a lot cheaper than beluga or sevruga) and go down nicely with chilled vodka or champagne.</p>
        <p>The inventive Cuban chef Douglas Rodriguez, who recently returned to Florida after several years at Patria restaurant in New York City, likes to serve a flat potato omelette topped with smoked salmon and a salmon roe sauce for brunch (in Spanish the omelette is called 'tortilla' although it is not made with flour or corn but is like the Italian frittata). This dish, served warm, is perfect with champagne.</p>
        <p>White truffles from Italy are now in season and since they are expensive, they tend to be reserved for special occasions. They have a subtle yet amazingly pungent aroma and are delicious grated in thin slices over risotto or pasta.</p>
        <p>''The truffle is not at all a positive aphrodisiac,'' the French gastronome Brillat-Savarin wrote, ''but it can, on certain occasions, make women more tender and men more amiable.''</p>
        <p>What better way to start the New Year?</p>
        <p>Blinis With Caviar  Total time: 2 hours rising 45 minutes hands on</p>
        <p>1 1/2cup milk</p>
        <p>1package yeast</p>
        <p>1 1/2cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2cup buckwheat flour</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1teaspoon sugar</p>
        <p>4large eggs, separated</p>
        <p>4ounces unsalted butter, melted</p>
        <p>6to 8 ounces caviar</p>
        <p>2cups sour cream.</p>
        <p>1. Bring the milk to a boil in a small saucepan and set it aside. Dissolve the yeast in a quarter of a cup of warm water. Sift the white flour into a mixing bowl and add the buckwheat flour, salt and sugar.</p>
        <p>2. Beat egg yolks until thick and sticky. When milk has cooled to lukewarm, add egg yolks and three tablespoons of melted butter and mix well. Add yeast, mix well and pour mixture into flour. Stir thoroughly, removing lumps. Cover with kitchen towel and leave in warm place for two hours, or until doubled in bulk.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Whip the egg whites into stiff peaks and fold them into the batter.</p>
        <p>4. Lightly butter a small nonstick frying pan, wiping out the excess grease with a paper towel. Pour in enough of the pancake mixture to coat the bottom of the pan. When the mixture begins to bubble, turn the pancake over and cook it lightly on the other side.</p>
        <p>5. Wrap pancakes in napkin as they are cooked and keep them warm in oven. Serve in a pile, wrapped in the napkin. Serve remaining melted butter, caviar and sour cream in small bowls on the table. Each person puts a pancake on the plate, butters it, adds sour cream and caviar and rolls it like a crepe.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Potato and Onion Tortilla With Smoked Salmon  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>For salmon roe sauce:</p>
        <p>1cup mayonnaise</p>
        <p>1/2cup sour cream</p>
        <p>2teaspoons fresh lime juice</p>
        <p>1teaspoon horseradish</p>
        <p>2tablespoons grated onion</p>
        <p>3tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley</p>
        <p>4tablespoons chopped chives</p>
        <p>1/2cup salmon roe</p>
        <p>For the tortilla:</p>
        <p>3tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>2medium potatoes, peeled and diced</p>
        <p>1large onion, diced</p>
        <p>12large eggs</p>
        <p>1/2cup milk</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/2pound thinly sliced smoked salmon.</p>
        <p>1. Make the sauce. Combine all the ingredients except the roe in a medium mixing bowl. Mix until well blended, then gently fold in the roe. Chill until ready to serve.</p>
        <p>2. Make the tortilla. Heat two tablespoons of the olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and onion and saute until tender, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Beat the eggs and milk together in a large bowl. Heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan. Add the egg mixture and when it starts to cook on the bottom, add the potato and onion mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Run a spatula along the sides of the pan, lifting up the eggs to let the uncooked egg run underneath to cook. When the tortilla is cooked except for the very top, remove it from the heat and slide it onto a plate. Flip the tortilla back into the pan, runny side down, and cook for an additional two to three minutes (you can also put it under a very hot broiler instead of turning it over). Slide the tortilla onto a large round serving dish and garnish with the sliced smoked salmon. Serve warm with the salmon roe sauce passed separately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This recipe is adapted from Douglas Rodriguez in ''Home Food'' by Debbie Shore and Catherine Townsend (Clarkson Potter).</p>
        <p>Risotto With White Truffles  Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>4tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>2shallots, minced</p>
        <p>2cups Arborio rice</p>
        <p>1cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>About 6 cups chicken broth</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>2tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan</p>
        <p>1whole white truffle (about 1 ounce or more).</p>
        <p>1. Melt two tablespoons butter over medium heat in a heavy saucepan and soften the shallots. Add the rice and stir with a wooden spoon to coat the grains with butter. Let the rice cook three to four minutes to absorb the butter and turn opaque.</p>
        <p>2. Add the wine, let it bubble up, stir the rice and start adding the chicken broth a ladle at a time. Keep stirring and adding broth for about 20 minutes. The rice will absorb the liquid.</p>
        <p>3. Test the rice for hardness. It is done when it is al dente, soft but firm to the bite. It should not be mushy. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>4. Let the rice sit off heat for two to three minutes. Stir in the remaining butter and the Parmesan.</p>
        <p>5. Spoon risotto onto four warm plates and grate the truffle thinly on top. Pass additional grated Parmesan separately at the table.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
