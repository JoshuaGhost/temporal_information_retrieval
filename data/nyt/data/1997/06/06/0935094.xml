Albright laid out an activist agenda for American responsibility and leadership in the post-Soviet world during a speech at Harvard University's commencement exercises. Her words echoed those of George Marshall, who, 50 years ago on the same occasion, spoke of his plan to rebuild Europe with American aid. Ms. Albright also urged that indicted Balkan war criminals be brought to justice.</p>

        <p>Power-Sharing Starts in France  France's conservative President Jacques Chirac presided over the first session of the new Socialist-led Government that voters elected against his wishes on Sunday. The new Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, briefly outlined his Government's plan to stimulate growth and create jobs.</p>

        <p>Algerians Go to the Polls  Algerians voted for what will be the country's first multiparty Parliament since winning independence in 1962. Some 300,000 security officers guarded the polls. The party favored by the Government was expected to win but it was not clear that it would emerge with a parliamentary majority. The populist Islamic Salvation Front, now banned, dismissed the elections as a sham.</p>

        <p>Coup Leaders Vow to Fight On  Coup leaders in Sierra Leone admitted they lacked the firepower to win another clash with Nigerian forces, but vowed to ''defend the motherland'' from outside intervention. They also said that the ousted President, Ahmed Tejan Kabban, could return, albeit not as President, if Nigeria would release the leader of another rebel group currently under house arrest in Nigeria. Renegade soldiers roamed Freetown's streets, looting houses and harassing drivers.</p>

        <p>Clash in Korean Waters  A North Korean military vessel accompanied three fishing boats into South Korean-controlled waters and fired three shots in the direction of South Korean military vessels, officials in Seoul said. The North Korean ships retreated when fired upon. There were no injuries. North Korea appears to be on the verge of famine but canceled a plan to barter zinc for 20,000 tons of American wheat.</p>

        <p>King Says Jordan Erred in 1967  In a radio address to his countrymen, King Hussein of Jordan said his decision to join other Arab nations in the 1967 war against Israel was a major blunder. During the war, Jordan lost the West Bank and the Arab sector of Jerusalem and was overwhelmed by 200,000 Palestinian refugees.</p>

        <p>Brief Power Failure in Chunnel  A train carrying cars and passengers was trapped in the Channel Tunnel between France and Britain for 30 minutes because of a power failure. The transport of trucks in the tunnel resumed after several hours, said a spokeswoman for the tunnel's operator. The truck service was restored last month on a trial basis after a fire.</p>

        <p>Pentagon Chief Criticized For His Support of General  Defense Secretary William S. Cohen was confronted with increasing criticism for his decision to support the appointment of a general who had an adulterous affair as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. New questions also arose about the officer's past. Some members of Congress said Mr. Cohen was encouraging a double standard on sexual conduct.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>The White House refused to say whether President Clinton agreed with Mr. Cohen that the general, Joseph W. Ralston of the Air Force, should not be disqualified from consideration for the appointment.</p>

        <p>Fake Donors Investigated  Investigators think at least $200,000 in contributions to President Clinton's 1996 campaign may have come from fictitious donors, including a $3,000 check from a dead woman.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said the Federal Election Commission should ban unregulated donations to political parties, the type of contributions, known as soft money, at the center of inquiries into Democratic finances.</p>
        <p>A26</p>
        <p>Higher Standard in Schools</p>
        <p>The Chicago public schools, once called the worst in the nation, are enforcing strict standards for promoting students. Almost half of the ninth graders and about one-quarter of the eighth graders will have to stay back a year unless they attend summer school and pass a standardized test. Unlike in previous years, eighth graders who have failed cannot attend graduation ceremonies.</p>

        <p>Case Divides Justice Dept.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department appears deeply divided over whether to back the President or the Whitewater independent counsel in the Supreme Court case involving lawyers' notes of conversations with Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>A27</p>
        <p>Jury Hears Bombing Tales  In the second day of the death penalty phase of the trial of Timothy J. McVeight, witnesses wept and struggled for words as they told jurors of their experiences after the Oklahoma City bombing. The prosecution may finish its case for a death sentence this morning. Lawyers for Mr. McVeigh are expected to call 30 to 40 witnesses.</p>

        <p>Spy Sentenced to 23 Years  Harold J. Nicholson, the highest-ranking C.I.A. officer ever convicted of espionage, was sentenced to 23 years and seven months in prison, the term requested by Federal prosecutors after Mr. Nicholson's guilty plea. He told the judge that he sold secrets to Russia to provide better for his three sons.</p>

        <p>$200 Million for a College  The F.W. Olin Foundation is committing $200 million to build an engineering college near Boston. The gift is the largest in history to American higher education. The Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering will teach undergraduates engineering in interdisciplinary ways recommended by recent National Science Foundation studies.</p>

        <p>Robbery Is Suspected As Motive in Levin Slaying  Investigators said Jonathan M. Levin, son of the chairman of Time Warner, was murdered for money and said that among the suspects were former students at the Bronx high school where Mr. Levin was a beloved teacher. A hazy photograph, taken by a surveillance camera at an automated teller machine, shows a boy or man withdrawing $800 using Mr. Levin's card.</p>

        <p>$4 Million to Attica Inmate</p>
        <p>A former Attica inmate who was beaten and tortured by guards in reprisal for the uprising at the prison in 1971 was awarded $4 million in damages by a Federal court jury in Buffalo. The plaintiff, Frank Smith, was the first of 1,281 inmates to win damages in the case.</p>

        <p>Prosecutors Criticize Rent Plan</p>
        <p>The District Attorneys of Manhattan, Queens and Brooklyn said a proposal to end rent regulations when apartments become vacant would encourage criminal harassment of tenants by landlords. Two of the prosecutors also predicted that imposing criminal penalties more frequently in harassment cases, as Governor Pataki has proposed, would flood the already overburdened criminal justice system.</p>
        <p>B1</p>
        <p>Borrowing Plan Approved</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Legislature approved Governor Whitman's plan to borrow $2.75 billion to close a deficit in the state pension system and a gap in her new state budget. The proposal was passed narrowly after a lengthy debate a much arm twisting.</p>
        <p>B4</p>
        <p>48 Charged in Drug Ring  The Manhattan District Attorney announced the indictment of 48 people who were said to be members of an East Village heroin gang called 'the Champion Crew.'' Prosecutors called the gang especially violent and enterprising, using children to sell drugs, setting up franchises and spreading their business throughout the city and into several states.</p>

        <p>Strict Internet Regulation</p>
        <p>German prosecutors and politicians are pushing harder than officials in other Western democracies to govern the seemingly ungovernable reaches of cyberspace. One such case involves a student who faces charges for having a home page with a link to a radical newspaper.</p>
