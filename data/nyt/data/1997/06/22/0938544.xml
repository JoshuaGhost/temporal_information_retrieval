      <abstract>
        <p>Stereotype that doctors tend to discount the health complaints of women whom they regard as hysterical is borne out by Walter Reed Army Medical Center study finding that doctors tended to order cardiac testing for conservatively dressed, businesslike woman complaining of chest pain, while diagnosing panic attack or anxiety when woman wore flashy clothes and spoke histrionically (Special section, Women's Health) (S)</p>

        <p>It may be a stereotype about stereotypes, but there is widespread belief that doctors tend to discount the health complaints of women whom they regard as hysterical.</p>
        <p>To test the validity of this, researchers presented 44 internists -- 40 male and 4 female -- at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington with the same 40-year-old woman (an actress) describing symptoms that included chest pains. The doctors were split into groups. One watched a video in which the woman was dressed conservatively and spoke in a businesslike way. The second group watched a video in which the woman, wearing flashy clothes and jewelry, spoke histrionically.</p>

        <p>Yes, the woman's manner mattered. For the doctors who watched the agitated performance, the patient's risk factors for heart disease -- from smoking and high cholesterol -- seem to have been obscured by her demeanor. Only 53 percent of the doctors who viewed the emotional presentation said they would order cardiac testing, and 73 percent offered diagnoses like panic attacks or anxiety. By contrast, fewer than a third of the doctors who watched the businesslike performance suspected anxiety, and all but one ordered cardiac testing.</p>
        <p>The third group read a transcript of the woman's statement; their diagnoses fell exactly in between.</p>
