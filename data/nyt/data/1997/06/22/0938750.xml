        <p>IN 1921, The New York Times said the gay colors and picturesque stucco rowhouse alterations made 64th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues a ''fairy-book street,'' an informal counterpoint to the buttoned-up limestone mansions off Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>But prices on this block are now at white-tie levels and a new cadre of buyers, paying millions of dollars, are replacing its offhand intimacy with Fifth Avenue style.</p>
        <p>This block of 64th was built up in the 1870's with traditional high-stoop brownstone rowhouses for the families of local businessmen and small merchants. The location was not close to Central Park or Fifth Avenue, but Lexington was still a street of single-family houses, and downtown rail service on Third Avenue was good. The three-story height of most of the buildings reflected an area with moderate land values -- closer to Fifth, such rowhouses were usually four stories tall.</p>
        <p>After the turn of the century the houses were declining with age, even as luxury development pushed out from Park and Fifth Avenues. In 1902, Robert D. Graham, an architect moving up from Murray Hill, bought the old brownstone at 163 East 64th and rebuilt it in the Beaux-Arts style used on town houses closer to Fifth: brick with iron balconies and rusticated limestone. Graham moved into his startling new house with his family of three and seven servants. There was nothing like him, or his house, on the block -- a new social order was arriving.</p>
        <p>At the same time, other owners and architects thought that remaking brownstones should entail different solutions from those used for traditional elite town houses. In 1910, the architect John W. Cross -- who later designed Tiffany &amp; Company at 57th and Fifth -- made over 176 East 64th simply by removing the stoop.</p>
        <p>Other such alterations followed, especially after the architect Frederick Sterner transplanted his ''block beautiful'' experiment from East 19th Street onto East 63d, one block south. In 1917 Sterner gave his signature tinted stucco front, iron balconies and tile roof to 170 East 64th for Henry G. Leach, an author and curator who moved over from an apartment at 829 Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>Another alteration specialist, James Casale, redid 172 East 64th in the neo-Medieval style in 1919, and other makeovers followed.  In 1921 Helen Bullitt Lowry called this style a ''Maxfield Parrish mirage'' in The Times and observed that all this work constituted ''a new school of New Yorkized Venetian'' with the ''warm blush of pink stucco and gay red tiles.''</p>
        <p>In 1923, the architect Frank Forster gave Dr. Harold Mixsell's house at 161 East 64th the most ambitious makeover yet -- a Spanish-style front of intricately worked yellow terra cotta with a tiled, pent eave roof. Dr. Mixsell, a squash champion and pediatrician, had his office on the top floor behind a picturesque oriel window.</p>
        <p>IN 1931, the architect William L. Bottomley, then finishing up the majestic River House on East 52d Street, gave 159 East 64th an elaborate Spanish Renaissance stucco front for another doctor, Amanda Hoff. It was at this point that the block was at its most picturesque, with the bright stucco villas contrasting with the older brownstones.</p>
        <p>The 64th Street block changed only marginally over the years, and it later served residents ranging from Harry Stack Sullivan, the psychiatrist, at 158, and Martin Beck, the theater promoter, at 166, to Theodore White, the political writer, at 168, and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, who moved out of 171 only a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Beginning in 1981, a new wave of alterations, as potent as the first one, hit the block with the architect Ralph Albanese's French Classical design for 174 East 64th, in stucco imitating limestone. ''They knew they were doing something different'' recalls Mr. Albanese, who says his clients wanted to emulate a French town house.</p>
        <p>In 1988 the architect George Rycar erased the old Mixsell house -- it had been painted so many times it was hard to decipher the original delicate stucco work. He gave it a new, Classically-styled front for an art dealer: ''he was Scandinavian, he wanted it very clean'' Mr. Rycar recalls. Other similar projects have followed, usually with the same effect of wiping out the older character of the block, and now there is a mini-building boom under way.</p>
        <p>The architect Gilles Depardon is now removing the original brownstone decoration of the Schlesinger house for a new limestone and stucco imitation front. And for an Austrian developer seeking to build and sell a ''mini-mansion,'' the architect Robert Scarano is remaking the old brownstone at 180 East 64th Street into a ''contextual facade.''  But instead of the older material, he is using limestone, which he said would be ''more formal, more Fifth Avenue, like the $4,000 man's suit.''</p>
        <p>''This seems to be the wave of the nouveau riche right now'' he added.</p>
        <p>Work is also under way at 174, 176 and most notably 185, which is a particularly careful and intelligent piece of work in limestone-type stucco designed by Kenneth Barricklo of Kingston, N.Y., for Joel and Susan Mindel. Mr. Barricklo describes it as French Renaissance, and says that he sought to make a connection to the Fifth Avenue end of the street. Because of a setback building next door, the new facade of 185 is fully detailed along part of its eastern lot line, and Mr. Barricklo has gone to the trouble to locate the false joints of the new stucco work over the actual joints of the underlying brownstone, to reduce cracking.</p>
        <p>So there is a decided trend to the palatial on this block, and part of the reason is cost.  Houses that traded for $100,000 or $200,000 in the 1960's and 1970's rose to the low millions in the early 1980's; now Edward Lee Cave has the old Mixsell house, in its new ''Fifth Avenue'' garb, for sale for $6.9 million.</p>
        <p>In 1918 the magazine Architecture praised the new, informal designs of houses on East 64th Street, for which the owners were paying $20,000 to $50,000. But the magazine added: ''When the owner has paid $100,000 for his plot of ground the pace has been set for a building commensurate with the value of the ground. There is no doubt that this has much to do with the error of pompous and palatial erection''.</p>
        <p>Most of the trees on this block of 64th Street have dead branches, open wounds and hard-packed soil, but they are still large, and arch over the street in a soft green canopy, buffering the traffic and rows of parked cars. Mr. Cave calls this block among the 10 most beautiful on the East Side, and the owner of the old Graham house, who declined to be named, says: ''It's the street to live on, not like the Fifth-to-Madison crowd -- they just want their names in the paper. I think this block is getting better all the time.''</p>
