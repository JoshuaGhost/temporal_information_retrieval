        <p>Reversing a lower court decision, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled unanimously yesterday that the estate of a divorced father is responsible for paying his son's college tuition because the divorce papers did not specify what would happen if either parent died.</p>
        <p>When an Old Bridge couple, Donald and Ellen Kiken, were granted a divorce in 1982, they agreed to pay for their son David's higher education depending on their income and assets. Mr. Kiken died in an automobile accident in 1986, and when David was admitted to the University of Pennsylvania in 1994, the executor of the estate, which was worth between $10 million and $16 million, said the obligation to pay for college had ended when Mr. Kiken died.</p>
