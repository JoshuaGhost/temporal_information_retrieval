        <p>Lawyers for Jesse Timmendequas say the 36-year-old sex offender, convicted of killing 7-year-old Megan Kanka, was sexually abused as a child by his father, a career criminal with several aliases who once raped a young girl as Jesse and his brother Paul watched and then tortured their pets to make sure they wouldn't tell on him.</p>

        <p>Lawyers for Jesse Timmendequas say the 36-year-old sex offender, convicted of killing 7-year-old Megan Kanka, was sexually abused as a child by his father, a career criminal with several aliases who once raped a young girl as Jesse and his brother Paul watched and then tortured their pets to make sure they wouldn't tell on him.</p>
        <p>But even before a New Jersey jury began deliberating Mr. Timmendequas's sentence and considering whether childhood abuse was reason to spare his life, the father, now known as James Howard, said last week that the accusations were lies and excuses invented to save his son from the execution he deserves.</p>
        <p>In the California desert where he lives with his wife and a 22-year-old son in a compound of trailers, Mr. Howard, who is 70, said that he left the Timmendequas family before most of the abuse is said to have occurred. He said Paul, 33, whose taped testimony detailing the abuse was played for the jury, concocted the stories after they had a falling out several years ago when Paul confessed that he and Jesse used to have sex with their half-sister.</p>
        <p>About the claims that he abused his sons and their pets, Mr. Howard, whose gated compound contains a wading pool for his 11 dogs, said the part about torturing small animals ''hurts the most.''</p>
