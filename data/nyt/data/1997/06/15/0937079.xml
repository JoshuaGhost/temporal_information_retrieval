        <p>SOUTHINGTON MOUNTAIN echoes with the bang of hammers and the whirr of drills these days. The smell of fresh-cut lumber and diesel fumes hang in the air. But soon the sounds should be replaced by squeals of delight as well as the odors of cotton candy and hamburgers wafting through the air.</p>
        <p>At 11 A.M. on June 27, for the first time in almost a decade, Kennywood Entertainment Company of West Mifflin, Pa., will open the 325-acre Lake Compounce Amusement Park for the entire summer season. (Since the 1980's, it has opened one weekend a year to maintain its record as the oldest continually operating amusement park in the country.) The park will be open daily except Tuesdays through Aug. 24, and then weekends and holidays until Sept. 21.</p>

        <p>SOUTHINGTON MOUNTAIN echoes with the bang of hammers and the whirr of drills these days. The smell of fresh-cut lumber and diesel fumes hang in the air. But soon the sounds should be replaced by squeals of delight as well as the odors of cotton candy and hamburgers wafting through the air.</p>
        <p>At 11 A.M. on June 27, for the first time in almost a decade, Kennywood Entertainment Company of West Mifflin, Pa., will open the 325-acre Lake Compounce Amusement Park for the entire summer season. (Since the 1980's, it has opened one weekend a year to maintain its record as the oldest continually operating amusement park in the country.) The park will be open daily except Tuesdays through Aug. 24, and then weekends and holidays until Sept. 21.</p>
        <p>Compounce will have 15 major new rides -- including a contraption called the Zoomerang that takes riders through two inverted turns, then back again, backwards, to the beginning. It will have three new shows, including Circus World, and five new major attractions, such as a 2,400-seat lakeside picnic pavilion and a  chime that will sound on the hour and half hour, while some animated characters spin through their paces every 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>More than 350 trees and 2,000 shrubs have been planted. Helicopters have been busy putting in the footings for a chairlift that will take people 750 feet up to the top of the mountain, where it's possible to see Long Island Sound to the south and Massachusetts to the north. There will be a 1,400-foot trolley ride along the shore of the 28-acre lake bass and sunfish can be seen swimming lazily along, 50 feet from the shore.</p>
        <p>Work has been progressing. On a recent tour of the park, Harry W. Henninger, president of Kennywood, walked south along the shore of the lake to inspect the $4 million Thunder River Raft Ride that will have a 30-foot waterfall powered by 110,000 gallon-a-minute pumps; 15 minutes later, as he strolled back, a crew was putting the finishing touches on more than 70 feet of white cedar fence that had not even been delivered when he walked by earlier.</p>
        <p>''It's amazing to see how fast this place is being transformed,'' Mr. Henninger said. ''Right about now, you've got to be careful not to stand still for a few minutes, because you could get painted or nailed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Henninger acknowledged that after a string of developers made promises that were not kept, it was difficult convincing officials, vendors and contractors that Kennywood was serious. He said he even worried about whether residents in the 40-mile circle around the park that he considers his primary market would trust Kennywood.</p>
        <p>''But everyone feels so good about what we've been doing, and I think they're going to give us a chance,'' Mr. Henninger said. ''If we do a good job, they'll come back. If we do a not-so-good job, they won't. But we're going to do a great job.''</p>
        <p>Carl O. Hughes, chairman of Kennywood, said Mr. Henninger had to use all his persuasive skills to convince the board that a park that had gone bust four times in the last eight years might be a good investment, but ultimately the directors were convinced.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Henninger appears to have inspired the confidence of the state -- which lent Kennywood $18 million of the $35 million it will invest in the park for its opening -- as well as the town of Bristol.</p>
        <p>''This has been a real roller coaster ride,'' said the Mayor of Bristol, Frank N. Nicastro Sr., of the park's recent history. ''Three or four years ago,'' Mr. Nicastro said, ''I had some real worries about its future, but now I'm convinced that it's under the proper management to be a major success.'' He said that back taxes have been paid, permits are all in place, and the management has been cooperating with the town.</p>
        <p>John J. Leone, executive director of the Bristol Chamber of Commerce, said he hoped that the impact of Lake Compounce would be far greater than the 500 seasonal and 40 to 60 year-round jobs the park is expected to create. He hopes the crowds that go to the park will also patronize local businesses.</p>
        <p>''Gas stations are going to do more business, restaurants are going to do more business,'' Mr. Leone said. He also thought there would probably be more overnight stays as well as ''some overflow business at the Carousel Museum and the Clock Museum.'' He said it was one more way to make Connecticut a destination for tourism, rather than simply a stop along the way to another place. ''In Texas you have to drive four hours just to get to the next town,'' he said. ''In Connecticut, you're never much more than an hour away from wherever else you want to go in the state. You can spend one day at Lake Compounce, the next on the coast, another day at one of the casinos;  we're developing a lot of things to bring people to the state.''</p>
        <p>Lake Compounce has been drawing crowds since Oct. 6, 1846, when a Bristol scientist, Samuel Botsford, mounted a series of experiments in electricity on the lake before thousands of onlookers. The lake's owner, Gad Norton, realized the potential for the site and put in a walking path, picnic tables, rowboats and a gazebo for lakeside concerts. Since 1875 the park has been the meeting place of the Crocodile Club: originally it was a group of legislators invited by Norton and Isaac Pierce in return for their passage of a law to make the park and their homes part of Bristol rather than Southington.</p>
        <p>The casino, which dates from 1895, was the first permanent building on the property, and about the same time the park's carousel was being assembled, with work from four master carvers. Throughout this century, the passive recreation that created the park has yielded to more active forms, bumper cars and Ferris wheels. The Norton family continued to run the park until 1985. Since then a string of operators have tried to run the park, with little success.</p>
        <p>Some people have said that in Connecticut the season is too short for an amusement park. But Mr. Henninger runs four successful parks in Pennsylvania, which are open anywhere from 87 to 120 days, a season comparable to Connecticut. ''You have to hope for good weather,'' he said, ''and you need a good marketing plan, and you have to keep investing in it, always have something new.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leone agreed: ''I think the numbers will work. You just need something to sell. And I think Kennywood has the ideas that it's going to take to get people to come back not only year after year, but more than once every season.''</p>
        <p>The new park still pays homage to the park's history, however. A new museum will display items from the park's history, including American Indian artifacts found on the site, a copy of the 1684 deed transferring the property to settlers, and copies of photographs taken at the park in the 1800's. And perhaps more important to most people -- the 1911 Lake Compounce Carousel, with its original 1896 working mechanism and Wurlitzer band organ, has been restored.</p>
        <p>Kennywood has clearly paid attention to detail. In the Park Side Diner, which is supposed to recreate a 1960's-era eatery, a white Squier Stratofender guitar on one table, and pictures of James Dean, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Fabian hang over the booths.</p>
        <p>''It's all part of our effort to recreate Compounce in an even grander manner than our fondest memory,'' Mr. Henninger said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Henninger says he hopes to add more attractions every year. Eventually, he hopes to make Lake Compounce into an attraction where a family can spend two or three days.</p>
        <p>The lake remains the centerpiece of the park, and the focus of conservation efforts. Extensive erosion controls are in place to prevent the lake from silting over, and runoff has been directed away from the lake. Loggers have cut only enough of the trees along the tracks to give people a view of the lake and the mountains, but thick stands of stately birch, oak and maple remain.</p>
        <p>People can hop on a 1911 trolley car on loan from the Trolley Museum in East Haven and ride from the main park at the north end, to the raft ride, chairlift and picnic pavilion on the south, or they can make the five-minute walk along a shaded path.</p>
        <p>''In the industry, to have 1,500 feet of undeveloped space is seen as a big mistake,'' Mr. Henninger said. ''I think everyone has had their fill of the asphalt parks that are barren, devoid of any natural features. We looked on this stretch as one of the park's assets.''</p>
        <p>Putting the park back in shape has required some patience. ''I don't think we were surprised at anything. You kept hoping that something wasn't going to need repair or repainting, but most of the time it did,'' Mr. Henninger said.</p>
        <p>But the work has been outweighed by the number of people who have dropped by to tell them that they had their first date at Compounce, or their first kiss. They met their wife or husband there, or a friend who has been with them ever since. ''It's amazing the number of people who have an old Lake Compounce story, something that took place years ago and still warms their hearts,'' Mr. Henninger said. ''That's the type of park we like to operate.''</p>
