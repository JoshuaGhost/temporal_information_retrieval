      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Julio Bocca and Nina Ananiashvili have only to step onto the stage, it seems, for audiences to explode with tumultuous applause. That was the case when American Ballet Theater presented the first ''Sleeping Beauty'' of its season on Tuesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. But even Mr. Bocca and Ms. Ananiashvili looked understated at times in a performance that was dedicated to Rudolf Nureyev but had too little of his larger-than-life engagement.</p>
        <p>This production of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' is a properly sumptuous staging by Kenneth MacMillan modeled, with additional choreography, on the Petipa original. It is also a rather brisk and sometimes anticlimactic restating of a story and dancing that are the apogee of ballet classicism. Radiant corps dancers formed an unusually animated frieze of moving bodies that served as a vital background for the ballet's battle between good and evil. But despite accomplished and even exciting performing, many of the major players failed to hold their own, melting instead into the pale wash of pastels that characterizes Nicholas Georgiadis's sets and costumes.</p>

        <p>Julio Bocca and Nina Ananiashvili have only to step onto the stage, it seems, for audiences to explode with tumultuous applause. That was the case when American Ballet Theater presented the first ''Sleeping Beauty'' of its season on Tuesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House. But even Mr. Bocca and Ms. Ananiashvili looked understated at times in a performance that was dedicated to Rudolf Nureyev but had too little of his larger-than-life engagement.</p>
        <p>This production of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' is a properly sumptuous staging by Kenneth MacMillan modeled, with additional choreography, on the Petipa original. It is also a rather brisk and sometimes anticlimactic restating of a story and dancing that are the apogee of ballet classicism. Radiant corps dancers formed an unusually animated frieze of moving bodies that served as a vital background for the ballet's battle between good and evil. But despite accomplished and even exciting performing, many of the major players failed to hold their own, melting instead into the pale wash of pastels that characterizes Nicholas Georgiadis's sets and costumes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ananiashvili's princess was obviously a well-loved child, conveyed through dancing that was sweetly playful as well as expansive, though not always adhering to the MacMillan version. Mr. Bocca blended grand classical manners with an affecting simplicity in his mime and in dancing in which every step and gesture was shaped with an invigorating clarity. Christine Dunham's gracious Lilac Fairy and Michael Owens's glitteringly overbearing Carabosse embodied the ballet's central battle. Ethan Stiefel's Blue Bird stood out for jumps and beats that were unforced and unfussy but whirred exotically.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stiefel's Florine was Ashley Tuttle, in a lead cast completed by Parrish Maynard and Martha Butler in the Gold and Diamond variations, and John Selya, who made of Catalbutte an amusingly fussy petty functionary. Jack Everly conducted the Tchaikovsky score.</p>
