        <p>In front of the City-County Building is an enormous statue officially called ''The Spirit of Detroit'' and colloquially known as ''The Jolly Green Giant.'' These days, he wears a size 360 Red Wings hockey jersey with its emblem of a winged wheel.</p>
        <p>The residents of Hockeytown wear smaller jerseys to pose in front of him for photographs. At his feet is a broom dyed red to symbolize the four-game sweep of the Stanley Cup finals, which ended last night with a 2-1 Red Wings victory over Philadelphia in Joe Louis Arena.</p>
        <p>When Commissioner Gary Bettman presented the Stanley Cup to captain Steve Yzerman after the game, he made a short, pointed speech about the ''mystique and tradition of the Detroit Red Wings.''</p>
        <p>''This is Hockeytown!'' Bettman said.</p>
        <p>After the ceremonial procession, the red-clad fans streamed out of the arena to begin a long night of celebration in the downtown district.</p>
        <p>Some headed toward the Spirit statue. All week long, it has been the focus of Detroit's hockey Woodstock atmosphere as the community celebrates its first drink from the cup since 1955.</p>
        <p>From this spot on Friday afternoon, the fans could hear the music of a free rock concert across Jefferson Avenue at Woodward Avenue.</p>
        <p>If they followed the sound past the big fist sculpture, the Joe Louis monument, to Hart Plaza, they could see and hear Mitch Ryder's band playing under the warm sunshine in the cool breeze off the Detroit River that separates the city from Canada.</p>
        <p>Ryder, the lead singer of the Detroit Wheels in the 1960's, added a special number to his repertory of hits like ''Devil With a Blue Dress On.'' The extra tune was the theme from ''Rocky,'' the Sylvester Stallone film about a Philadelphia boxer.</p>
        <p>''We want to make our Philadelphia guests feel welcome,'' Ryder told his cheering audience. ''Nothing wrong with the Flyers. They're just in the wrong place at the wrong time.''</p>
        <p>Many Detroiters get a sense of civic self-esteem from their sports teams, although the moniker Hockeytown -- painted over center ice at the arena -- isn't yet as well known as Motor City or Motown.</p>
        <p>''We tend to manifest our national image through our sports teams,'' Ryder said between sets. ''Detroit is a working-class community. It's a one-trick pony. If it wasn't for the car industry, we wouldn't have the city. We'd still be fur trappers, speaking French.''</p>
        <p>That reference was a tribute to those who founded Detroit almost three centuries ago. The Wings are one of the National Hockey League's oldest teams, established during the Roaring 20's, when Henry Ford and other automobile pioneers were building a boom town. The current hockey success is just one example of a sports and municipal renaissance during a relatively flush economic cycle.</p>
        <p>Construction of new stadiums for the Tigers and Lions, both downtown, is expected to begin this year. The Renaissance Center, an architectural monstrosity built on the riverfront 20 years ago, is being taken over by General Motors, which might give the place the focus and purpose it has lacked.</p>
        <p>Although much of downtown and the central city remains blighted and abandoned, the unemployment rate is down, the crime rate is down, car sales are up and property values are rising.</p>
        <p>In terms of hockey, the region is a mecca. Aside from the Wings, the Detroit area includes teams from two of the four major college leagues, a top team of the minor International Hockey League, two major junior teams from the Ontario Hockey League, a newly established permanent training facility for Team U.S.A.'s top junior players, two dozen local boys who have made it to the N.H.L. and a peculiar consciousness smuggled over the airwaves from neighboring Canada.</p>
        <p>It can be heard on local sports-talk radio, which constantly plays a scratchy recording of the late Foster Hewitt greeting his radio listeners on ''Hockey Night in Canada'' with the words: ''Hello, Canada and hockey fans in the United States and in Newfoundland and a special big hello to Canadian servicemen overseas.''</p>
        <p>The downside to the mood yesterday was anxiety over the inevitable celebration. When the Tigers won the World Series in 1984, the celebrators overturned and torched a police car outside the ball park, leaving a distinct, negative impression. When the Pistons won their second straight National Basketball Association championship in 1990, seven people were killed and many others were seriously injured.</p>
        <p>Thirty years ago, five days of race-based rioting left 43 people dead and hundreds of buildings burned, creating a downward spiral that lasted for a generation.</p>
        <p>Detroiters of a certain age, like Ryder, remember the mood here just before that riot: an upbeat city making Mustangs and muscle cars. Back then, the Wings were regularly in the cup finals and the Supremes and the Temptations were rolling hit after hit off Berry Gordy Jr.'s assembly line.</p>
        <p>It was an optimistic place. Back then, as now, the motto on the city seal, carved into the wall behind ''The Spirit of Detroit,'' read ''Speramus Meliora'' and ''Resurget Cineribus.'' The words mean ''We Hope for Better Things'' and ''It Shall Rise Again From the Ashes.''</p>
