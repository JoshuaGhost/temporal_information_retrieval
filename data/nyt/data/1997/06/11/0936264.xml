        <p>''Ronaldo, Romario.'' ''Romario, Ronaldo.'' Either way, it rolls off the tongue, and either way, it has become a mantra from Porto Alegre in the south of Brazil to Rio De Janeiro and Belem further north.</p>
        <p>Exactly one year before they begin defending their World Cup title in France, the Brazilians again appear to possess the most dangerous striker tandem in international soccer.</p>
        <p>In the United States in 1994, Bebeto was Romario's sidekick, and even though the team that backed them up was busier defending than channeling the bulk of its energy into encouraging offensive artistry, the two strikers' individual talents were decisive.</p>
        <p>Ronaldo, then 17, watched every memorable minute from the bench.</p>
        <p>''It was difficult not to play,'' he said. ''But I learned a lot from Romario and Bebeto. They were on top of their games.''</p>
        <p>Three years later, Bebeto has moved on, Ronaldo has emerged as the sport's biggest star, and Romario, the consensus 1994 world player of the year, has returned to the blue-green-and-yellow fold after a prolonged and well-documented fall from grace.</p>
        <p>The English have Alan Shearer, the Germans Jurgen Klinsmann, the Croats Davor Suker and Alen Boksic. But no team currently has the blend of youthful explosiveness and mature guile up front that the 20-year-old Ronaldo Luis Nazario de Lima and the 31-year-old Romario de Souza Faria represent.</p>
        <p>In the seven games since Romario returned to the national team after two years of a very public separation and often uninspired play, he and Ronaldo have combined for 11 goals on a team that looks considerably more committed to the attack than in 1994. Romario has scored eight goals, including the game-winner in tonight's 1-0 victory over England in the Tournoi de France, a friendly four-team tournament organized as an aperitif before next summer's 64-course meal: the World Cup finals.</p>
        <p>England had already clinched the tournament title with victories over Italy and France. Brazil finished with one victory and two ties, but Romario, his teammates and the venerable coach Mario Zagallo are more interested in what happens next June than this June.</p>
        <p>''I am looking for a second world championship, and I am counting very much on Ronaldinho,'' Romario said recently, using Ronaldo's nickname in Brazil. ''You will see. The two of us will finish on top of the scoring tables in 1998.''</p>
        <p>That would be nothing new for either of these men who share the same home city (Rio de Janeiro), the same modest economic backgrounds and the same ability to go from first to fourth gear in a big hurry. Both have led the Brazilian, Dutch and Spanish leagues in scoring. Like Romario, Ronaldo left Brazil for P.S.V. Eindhoven in the Netherlands; like Romario he was then sold to Spain's high-profile F.C. Barcelona where he promptly became the role model of choice on playgrounds around the world by ramming home spectacular goal after spectacular goal. Like Romario, who left Barcelona in a hurry in December 1994 after two tempestuous seasons, Ronaldo's stay in the Catalan capital looks likely to end quickly.</p>
        <p>For the last seven months, he and his many advisers have been involved in an increasingly acrimonious contract dispute with Barca that has had more twists and turns than the Amazon and created nearly countless headlines in Spain.  Though it appears that he will ultimately sign with Inter Milan for a world-record transfer fee of about $30 million, appearances have been deceptive in the past.</p>
        <p>Romario's future is more uncertain. After two and a half years with the Brazilian club Flamengo, he signed with the Spanish club Valencia last August, but after less than three months in Spain, only four goals and at least twice that many round trips to Rio de Janeiro, Valencia agreed to loan the unhappy striker back to Flamengo after he agreed to take a 50 percent salary cut.</p>
        <p>He has played brilliantly ever since. Zagallo welcomed him back to the national team in February. Valencia wants him back in August, as do a number of other European clubs with money to match their desire. The Oscar-winning director Anthony Minghella is reportedly mulling making a documentary of his life. But for now, all that looks like a sure bet is that Romario and Ronaldo will be complicating defenders' lives considerably in France next summer.</p>
