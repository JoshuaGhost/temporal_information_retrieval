        <p>SHALITA - MARMOUR - Debbie Temple Shaaray Tefila is filled with sorrow over her untimely death. She grew up in and was married in our synagogue. She shared her smile and laughter with all who knew her. We will sorely miss her. We extend our hearts and loving sympathy to her husband David, her parents Alan and Simone, to her twin sister Judy and all her family and friends. We will always remember her and pray for the comfort of those who loved her. Our sanctuary will embrace her one last time on Friday, June 13, at 11am. Harvey M. Tattelbaum, Rabbi Dr. Ellen R. Saxl, President</p>
        <p>SHALITA - MARMOUR - Deborah. Our hearts are broken by the tragic and sudden passing of our loving friend. All who met her were greeted with warmth and kindness. Our thoughts are with the Marmour and Shalita families during this difficult time. The Waxman Family</p>
        <p>SHALITA - MARMOUR - Deborah. The Board of Directors and shareholders and Wallack Management mourn the untimely passing of Deborah Shalita Marmour, the daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Alan Shalita. Our heartfelt sympathies are extended to the family.</p>
