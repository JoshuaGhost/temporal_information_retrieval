        <p>A M Rosenthal Op-Ed column contends that many American conservatives and liberals are uniting in their opposition to China's oppressive Government and US appeasement of Beijing by Bush and Clinton Administrations (M)</p>

        <p>In every struggle for human rights, the time comes when governments that rule by repression can no longer block penalties by the democracies.</p>
        <p>They lose that power when people of free countries who differ on other important matters decide to use their combined political weight against religious and political persecution in the dictatorships.</p>
        <p>Movement toward that unity of purpose is beginning between many American conservatives and liberals. Some are motivated by longtime revulsion against China's system of rule by oppression and U.S. appeasement of Beijing during the Bush and Clinton Administrations.</p>
        <p>Other Americans have awakened to the persecution of Christians in China and about a dozen other Communist and Muslim countries. They add a critical new engine against religious oppression, and so for all human rights. Name a country that has wiped out either political or religious freedom, and permits the other to flourish.</p>
        <p>Americans fighting the Chinese repression and the strengthening of Beijing by American business took an expected loss on Tuesday. The House of Representatives defeated another attempt to make China pay the price of increased tariffs for its persecutions. The bill gained 30 more votes than last year but went down because of the political pressure of the Clinton Administration, whose betrayal of human rights in China has made it Beijing's prisoner, and the money power of the U.S.-China business lobby. It was a sorrowful defeat for the Chinese and Tibetans in slave-labor camps.</p>
        <p>But in Washington and across the country Americans long in the human rights struggle and those new to it are just beginning to fight.</p>
        <p>Beginning this summer, a hopper full of bills will be presented, aimed at Chinese political and religious oppression. Among them will be a package from Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, a strong fighter for human rights.</p>
        <p>One bill would increase tariffs for the hundreds of companies owned by the Chinese Army, which uses profits to make itself bigger and better. Another would tighten the ban on slave labor goods, or try to. Others would cut off American contributions to loans to China from international organizations like the World Bank and mandate annual U.S. reports on Chinese manipulation of American politics with money or espionage.</p>
        <p>Another goal: to hamper Chinese sale of nuclear, chemical and cruise-missile material and technology. To be believable, the legislation should include Congressional investigation and disclosure of all the cases the Clinton Administration knew about, but would not act on.</p>
        <p>No proposed legislation will be as effective a human rights message to China and the world as taking away Beijing's tariff privileges -- an effort that will go on in Congress.</p>
        <p>But the bills will speak for America against tyranny. They will also  test the good faith of Speaker Newt Gingrich and other Congressmen. They opposed ending China's tariff privileges across the board. But they promised to support other action to fight rule by terror in China.</p>
        <p>Then in the fall, as part of a campaign against religious persecution leading up to an International Day of Prayer, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Representative Frank Wolf of Virginia, both Republicans, will present another bill. It is a call for action against all countries persecuting Christians, Buddhists and members of the Bahai faith -- as in Iran. It will include a variety of sanctions against persecuting countries, such as withholding international loans; make immigration to the U.S. easier for victims of religious oppression, and set up a special office in the White House to monitor and report on religious persecution.</p>
        <p>Congressional action would then have two spearheads -- against Chinese repression of all human rights, and against religious persecution internationally. The combination would be logical -- and doable if American unity for human rights holds.</p>
        <p>After World War II, much of the Western left edged off from the fight for human rights in Communist countries. Conservatives looked away almost everywhere else. The losers were the people in the cells.</p>
        <p>So if the still-developing and largely untested unity can be preserved it will be of historic importance in the fight for human rights, and the revival of America's role in it.</p>
