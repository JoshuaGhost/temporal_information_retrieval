        <p>A Superior Court judge in Burlington County has promised the mother of a teen-ager killed by a drunken driver that he will review comments made by another judge that offended her.</p>
        <p>Before sentencing the driver, Robert Kinzel, for manslaughter in the 1995 death of Shannon Wittkopp, 14, of Southampton Township, Judge Donald P.

        <p>A Superior Court judge in Burlington County has promised the mother of a teen-ager killed by a drunken driver that he will review comments made by another judge that offended her.</p>
        <p>Before sentencing the driver, Robert Kinzel, for manslaughter in the 1995 death of Shannon Wittkopp, 14, of Southampton Township, Judge Donald P. Gaydos chastised her family for not showing more compassion for the defendant. ''He actually said to us, 'Don't you have feelings for this man? Can't you see he has remorse?' '' said Sandra Eiseman, the victim's mother.</p>
        <p>She received a letter from Judge Harold B. Wells, the Superior Court judge, assuring her that he would look into the comments, which were made on June 19.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kinzel's lawyer, Francis J. Hartman, said that the family had expressed hatred for his client in letters written to the judge. ''To castigate a judge because he does not buy into your level of bitterness and animosity is worse than unfair,'' he said. ''It's not what justice is supposed to be.''</p>
