        <p>THE season for apricots is depressingly short. But from now through the end of next month they will be available in the markets, fresh, ripe and tender, with a flavor that intensifies when they cook.</p>
        <p>I like to bake apricots in a light syrup flavored with vanilla and kirsch and serve them with creme fraiche on the side. Baked apricots will keep for a week in the refrigerator, provided they are well coated with their syrup. (If not, their skins darken; this does not affect their taste, but it does not look very appetizing).</p>
        <p>Apricots also make a wonderful fruit tart, coated with an amaretto  glaze and served at room temperature. It goes with creme fraiche,  mascarpone, Isigny or Chambourcy cheese, or vanilla ice cream. It should not be refrigerated before being served or it will taste flat.</p>
        <p>Joyce Goldstein, the San Francisco chef and cookbook author, uses  apricots for clafouti, which is something of a cross between a pancake and a pudding. This dessert, which originates in the Limousin region of France, is normally made with cherries. It is particularly festive for a dinner party. Even though the baking takes place at the last minute, the marinating of the apricots and the readying of the batter ingredients can be done in advance. The batter is then poured over the fruit, which is baked in the oven for just over half an hour. The clafouti should be served warm and sprinkled with confectioners' sugar.</p>
        <p>With all these desserts, a chilled, fruity white wine is recommended.</p>
        <p>Apricot Tart  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2cups water</p>
        <p>4tablespoons sugar</p>
        <p>Vanilla bean, 1-inch piece</p>
        <p>2pounds firm, ripe apricots</p>
        <p>1/2cup amaretto, kirsch or apricot brandy</p>
        <p>110-  to 11-inch shortcrust pastry shell, fully cooked.</p>
        <p>1. Combine the water, sugar and vanilla bean and simmer for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Cut the apricots in half and remove the pits. Put them gently into the syrup and simmer them until almost tender. Remove them with a slotted spoon and put them on a plate. Leave a couple of apricot slices in the syrup.</p>
        <p>3. Add the amaretto to the syrup and continue to simmer until you have a thick glaze (about 15 to 20 minutes), mashing the remaining apricot halves with a spoon until they are amalgamated into the glaze.</p>
        <p>4. Just before serving, brush the pastry shell with the glaze. Arrange the apricot halves on the pastry shell, face down. Brush them with the remaining glaze and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Baked Apricots With White Wine  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2cups water</p>
        <p>1cup sugar</p>
        <p>1cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>1teaspoon cardamom seeds, tied in cheesecloth</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        <p>2pounds apricots, cut in half, pits removed.</p>
        <p>1. Combine the water, sugar, wine, cardamom seeds and vanilla extract in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook until reduced to about a cup (about 20 minutes).</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees. Arrange the apricots in a shallow baking dish that can be served from at the table. Pour the syrup on top and bake for about 30 minutes, or until the apricots are tender.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Apricot Clafouti  Total time: 1 hour, 45 minutes</p>
        <p>18apricots, cut in half, pits removed</p>
        <p>1tablespoon grated lemon peel</p>
        <p>1/4cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/4cup amaretto (optional)</p>
        <p>2tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>3eggs</p>
        <p>1cup milk</p>
        <p>1/2cup cream</p>
        <p>Salt to taste</p>
        <p>1teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
        <p>1/4teaspoon almond extract (optional)</p>
        <p>1/3cup sugar</p>
        <p>1cup flour</p>
        <p>Confectioners' sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Combine the apricots with the lemon peel, sugar and optional amaretto and marinate for about an hour in a bowl. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Butter a shallow pie pan or gratin dish. Put the apricots on the bottom of the plate.</p>
        <p>3. Combine the eggs, milk, cream, salt, vanilla, optional almond extract, sugar and flour in the container of a blender or food processor and pulse to combine, scraping down the sides to incorporate all of the flour. Make sure there are no lumps. Let the batter rest for five minutes.</p>
        <p>4. Pour batter over the fruit and bake until puffed and golden brown, about 35 minutes. Dust with confectioners' sugar and serve warm.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
