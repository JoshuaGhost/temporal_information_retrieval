        <p>''Ulysses'' has always been hard  to read, even for those who love it. But now an Irish scholar, Danis Rose, has edited James Joyce's masterpiece to make it more reader-friendly.</p>
        <p>The result is ''Ulysses: The Reader's Edition,'' which was recently published by Picador in London. Mr. Rose has made about 10,000 changes to the 250,000-word text, including re-organizing sentences to make their meanings clearer and altering punctuation, most drastically by adding apostrophes to Molly Bloom's unpunctuated soliloquy.</p>

        <p>''Ulysses'' has always been hard  to read, even for those who love it. But now an Irish scholar, Danis Rose, has edited James Joyce's masterpiece to make it more reader-friendly.</p>
        <p>The result is ''Ulysses: The Reader's Edition,'' which was recently published by Picador in London. Mr. Rose has made about 10,000 changes to the 250,000-word text, including re-organizing sentences to make their meanings clearer and altering punctuation, most drastically by adding apostrophes to Molly Bloom's unpunctuated soliloquy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose says he has scholarly reasons for all his changes, based on different early versions of the text and on Joyce's own explanations of his intent. But his new ''Ulysses'' has raised hackles in the small and highly competitive world of Joyce scholars.</p>
        <p>Leading the anti-Rose contingent is John Kidd, director of the James Joyce Research Center at Boston University, who also helped discredit a previous edition of ''Ulysses'' 10 years ago. Mr. Kidd, who is at work on his own version, said Mr. Rose was ''way out of the bounds of serious editing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose says he wanted people ''to experience the delight that Joyce experienced, which has been clouded by errors and by the heavy-handed manner in which the text was presented to us.''</p>
