        <p>WHEN DEBORAH DRATTELL BEGAN  considering subjects for her first opera, two years ago, only one thing was certain: her central character would be a strong-willed woman in dire circumstances.</p>
        <p>Anastasia, the Russian princess said to have survived the massacre of the royal family, came to mind. So did a handful of troubled poets. But the figure who tugged most insistently on Ms. Drattell's imagination was Lilith, a primordial she-devil described in Jewish mystical writings as Adam's first wife, banished from Eden and transformed into a demonic night-flying seductress and baby snatcher.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I do this intentionally,'' said Ms. Drattell, a 41-year-old composer whose music is vividly orchestrated and generally neo-Romantic, with a consistent undercurrent of dark introspection. ''It's just that when I look back, I see that I've written all these pieces about women, usually tortured women: Sylvia Plath, Anna Akhmatova, Lilith. I'm also attracted to women who triumph over the odds.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Drattell will undoubtedly have ample opportunity to bring those women to life. She was just appointed the first composer-in-residence at the New York City Opera even though she has never had an opera produced. ''Lilith,'' the opera she finished only a few weeks ago, was commissioned by the 92d Street Y and the Dicapo Opera Theater; it will have its premiere on Tuesday evening and run through Sunday at Dicapo, which is at 184 East 76th Street, at Lexington Avenue. Ms. Drattell has already composed a quarter of her second opera, which was also commissioned by Dicapo and is scheduled for next May; the Russian poet Marina Tsvetayeva is the subject. And Ms. Drattell may return to Anastasia for her first City Opera project.</p>
        <p>Ms. Drattell's first musical encounter with Lilith was in 1988, when she was composer-in-residence at the Denver Symphony. Inclined toward literary subjects and seeking an idea for an orchestral work, she was browsing in a bookstore. She found Gershom Scholem's book ''On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism'' and became intrigued by its reference to Lilith as ''queen of the demons.'' She composed an orchestral portrait, also called ''Lilith,'' which was given its premiere by the New York Philharmonic in 1990. A reworked version accompanies a dance sequence in the opera.</p>
        <p>Part of Lilith's attraction for Ms. Drattell is that there is so little information about her in classical sources. She is not mentioned in the Bible, but Genesis tells two creation stories: one in which God created ''male and female'' at the same time (1:27) and one in which Eve was fashioned from Adam's rib (2:22). The body of Jewish writings called the Midrash reconciles these stories by saying that the woman created first, at the same time as Adam, was Lilith, and that it was for insisting on physical and spiritual equality that she was condemned to eternal life as a demon.</p>
        <p>The Midrash adds that after Adam and Eve were expelled from Eden, Adam briefly reconciled with Lilith and produced a race of half-human demons. Lilith, in these sources, is portrayed in an entirely negative light. But because her crime was an assertion of independence against male domination, women have more recently rehabilitated her as a symbol. A Jewish feminist magazine is named for her. There are pages devoted to her on the Internet, and next month the Lilith Fair Festival, a female bill of folk and rock singers, is to tour the Middle West.</p>
        <p>''Ever since I first read about her, I kept thinking that in Eve and Lilith, we are really dealing with one woman in two parts,'' Ms. Drattell said. ''Eve was the nurturing mother and wife, who in many ways was unfulfilled because she was created from Adam's rib and was never fully herself. Lilith is the demonic and sensuous. And I realized right there that we had an opera. It's just that it's not a typical opera in the sense of boy meets girl.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Drattell and her librettist, David Steven Cohen, open their work at Adam's funeral. Eve and her descendants are at the grave, but so are Lilith's demonic offspring, whose demand for their birthright forces Eve to tell her own children about Lilith. Eve, actually, is the work's starring role; Lilith does not appear until Eve invokes her name at the end of the first act.</p>
        <p>The rest of the 75-minute opera is a string of encounters between Eve and Lilith. Eve is convinced that if she allows Lilith to take over her soul, Lilith will be purified, and she offers herself in place of a newborn whose soul Lilith is about to capture. Lilith nearly agrees, but changes her mind at the last moment, instead forcing Eve to confront the desires she has suppressed during her years as Adam's wife. Weakened by her own regrets, Eve is vulnerable, but she escapes when she hears the cries of her children. In the end, neither is able to overcome the other.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen, whose previous work includes collaboration on the screenplay for the animated feature ''Balto,'' and a Dr. Seuss series for the Muppets, views ''Lilith'' in essentially political terms.</p>
        <p>''THE FIRST THING THAT STRUCK ME  about her was that her story is about the inevitable result of oppression,'' he said. ''When one's natural desires are condemned, they can emerge as distortions. Lilith demanded spiritual and physical equality with Adam, a natural desire that could have found a natural outlet. But when she was denied it, she was forced into an eternity of unholy desires, murder, cruelty and destruction. I've always felt that Eve was haunted by this, and that her own desires were shaped by the fear of what happened to Lilith. It's a feminist story, but as a man, I want to generalize it to both sexes.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Drattell may seem to be coming late to opera, but her interest in linking literary works with orchestral and chamber pieces has long pointed toward a theatrical future, and vocal music has become an increasingly important part of her catalogue. She began her musical studies as a violinist, in Brooklyn, but after master classes with Itzhak Perlman at Brooklyn College, she realized that her stage fright would militate against a performing career. Eventually she switched to conducting and then composing.</p>
        <p>After studying with Robert Starer and Jacob Druckman, still at Brooklyn College, she did graduate work at Pennsylvania State University and earned her doctorate at the University of Chicago, where she studied with Ralph Shapey. She taught composition at Tulane University for six years, during which she founded and conducted the First Monday Contemporary Chamber Ensemble, a new-music group comprising principal players from the New Orleans Symphony. And in 1987, she became composer-in-residence in Denver. When the Denver Symphony folded, in 1989, she returned to New York.</p>
        <p>She has since directed or advised on concert series at Bryant Park, the New-York Historical Society and the Kaye Playhouse. Her music has increasingly turned up in chamber programs, and last year Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony released ''Sorrow Is Not Melancholy,'' a collection of her orchestral works (including ''Lilith'') on the Delos label. The title, taken from a work on the disk, captures the haunted character of so much of Ms. Drattell's music.</p>
        <p>In person, Ms. Drattell is hardly the overwrought woman her music suggests. She tends, in fact, to be chatty and amusing.</p>
        <p>''I'm not a tortured person,'' she said. ''I'm happily married. I have four children. I think of myself as a happy person. But I had a very difficult childhood, and I think that as a composer, I draw on things that are deep inside myself, not on the way I live my life today. I don't sit down and say, 'O.K., today I'm going to write dark, brooding music.' It's just what happens.</p>
        <p>''Actually, I tried to write something upbeat once. It was a piece called 'Spanish Fly,' for the Denver Symphony. It was fun, and humorous in a way, but there was also something dark about it. It wasn't very successful at sounding light.''</p>
