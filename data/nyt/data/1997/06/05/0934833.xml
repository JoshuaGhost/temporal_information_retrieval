        <p>Before reaching for an indignant pen, the reader is urged to read on. All is not quite what it seems.</p>
        <p>The diagramed deal, more or less, was played a week ago in the 34th UJA-Federation Charity Game at the Harmonie Club in Manhattan. The proceeds, more than $80,000, set a record, said the chairwomen,  Marci Miron and Tubby Stayman.</p>
        <p>The winning score, also thought to be a record, was 75 percent by Mark Molson of Montreal and Neil Scott of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Molson won a silver medal in the 1995 world championships in Beijing. Scott divides his time between Manhattan, his native England and Florida, where he is an owner of a club, Jordan's in Boca Raton.</p>
        <p>There are days when nothing can go wrong, and it was so for the winners. On the diagramed deal, they had a small accident and showed a profit. With the South hand, Scott bid clubs followed by spades. He then supported diamonds, and charged on to slam. The five-spade response showed two of the five key cards plus the queen of diamonds.</p>
        <p>In choosing his opening lead, West thought his best chance was to take at least one trick in dummy's second suit. He therefore led the spade jack, and when the dummy appeared everyone stared hard. Conscious that they were looking at him, Scott did a double-take. He then removed the ace of spades from his club suit and put it where it belonged.</p>
        <p>Molson won in dummy, led to the heart ace and ruffed a heart. He then announced that he would draw trumps and discard his losers on dummy's spades. He had made an overtrick that was worth a lot of match points.</p>
        <p>But if Scott had bid his hand normally, spades first and then clubs, the opening lead would probably have been a club, scoring a trick for the defense. He had achieved a rare maneuver: the lead-inhibiting accident.</p>
        <p>In the semifinal stage of the International Team Trial in New Orleans, the scores by captain after 30 deals of a scheduled 120 were: Seymon Deutsch of Laredo, Tex., led Jeff Wolfson of Chicago by 15 imps; Nick Nickell of Manhattan led Ralph Katz of Chicago by 35.</p>
        <p>In the once-defeated bracket, after 30 of 60 deals: Richard Schwartz of East Elmhurst, Queens, led Richard Pavlicek of Boca Raton, Fla., 18; Malcolm Brachman of Dallas led Kit Woolsey of Kensington, Calif., by 10; George Rapee of Manhattan led Edgar Kaplan of Manhattan by 28; Jim Cayne of Manhattan led Steve Beatty of Birmingham, Ala., by 35.</p>
