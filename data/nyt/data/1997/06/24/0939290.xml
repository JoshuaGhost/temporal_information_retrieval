      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Supreme Court ruled today that employees of companies that run prisons under contract with a state or local government are not entitled to the immunity from prisoner lawsuits that shields prison guards who are on the public payroll.</p>
        <p>The 5-to-4 decision, rejecting an immunity claim by two employees of the biggest private manager of correctional centers, could help shape the law and economics of the fast-growing move to the privatization of government services.</p>
        <p>Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen G. Breyer said that ''given a continual and conceded need for deterring constitutional violations,'' the traditional immunity doctrine that enables government employees to do their job without fear of lawsuits should not be extended to employees of private companies.</p>
        <p>Competitive pressures of the marketplace, making errant behavior expensive to defend and leading to the loss of contracts for poor work, should be permitted to operate, Justice Breyer said.</p>
        <p>In the dissenting opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia said the decision would make privatization more expensive for taxpayers and lead to windfalls for prisoners who bring suits and lawyers who represent them.</p>
        <p>Workers who perform a public function should receive a public employee's immunity, Justice Scalia said.</p>
        <p>The immunity doctrine in dispute shields state officials from liability for civil rights violations as long as their conduct does not violate ''clearly established'' rights that a ''reasonable person'' should have known.</p>
        <p>In legal terms, this is called ''qualified immunity,'' as distinguished from the absolute immunity accorded to judges, prosecutors and some other officials.</p>
        <p>In practical terms, qualified immunity is a powerful shield that makes it extremely hard to win a suit against a protected official.</p>
        <p>In the case today, an inmate of a prison in Tennessee that the Corrections Corporation of America of Nashville operated sued two guards for injuring him by keeping him in unduly tight physical restraints. The Federal District Court in Nashville and the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, ruled that the privately employed guards were not entitled to qualified immunity and rejected their motion to dismiss the suit.</p>
        <p>In upholding the lower court rulings, Justice Breyer's opinion surveyed the histories of the immunity doctrine and of the private operation of prisons, which he said was common in the 18th- and 19th-century United States and earlier in England. There was no corresponding tradition of immunity for the private jail operators, Justice Breyer said.</p>
        <p>Concluding that there was no reason to extend immunity now, Justice Breyer said the most important function of the doctrine was to prevent government employees from being unduly fearful in carrying out their normal duties.</p>
        <p>He said that ''unwarranted timidity'' was less likely to be a problem with a private operator, because ''competitive pressures mean not only that a firm whose guards are too aggressive will face damages that raise costs, thereby threatening its replacement, but also that a firm whose guards are too timid will face threats of replacement by other firms with records that demonstrate their ability to do both a safer and a more effective job.''</p>
        <p>The majority opinion, Richardson v. McKnight, No. 96-318, was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, David H. Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.</p>
        <p>''Function, not status'' should determine the scope of immunity, Justice Scalia said. He said it was ''fanciful to speak of the consequences of 'market' pressures in a regime where public officials are the only purchaser and other people's money the medium of payment.''</p>
        <p>The decision did not necessarily guarantee how the Court would rule on the status of employees of companies carrying out other privatized functions like determining welfare eligibility, for example, as is being discussed in some states, and where the competitive marketplace might operate differently. But the majority's rejection of Justice Scalia's emphasis on ''function'' as the determining principle means that it will be an uphill battle for any private worker to claim a public employee's immunity.</p>
        <p>The case was closely watched, in part because privatization is becoming so popular. Twenty-two states have laws to authorize contracts with companies to run correction programs. New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut are not among that group. The Corrections Corporation of America operates 49 correctional centers in 11 states and in England.</p>
        <p>There were also these other actions today as the Court began what it expects to be the final week of the 1996-97 term.</p>
        <p>State Inmates</p>
        <p>In an opinion by Justice Souter, the Court ruled, 5 to 4, that a 1996 law that placed sharp new restrictions on the ability of state prison inmates to receive hearings in Federal court did not apply retroactively to the petitions for writs of habeas corpus that were already pending in Federal court when the law took effect.</p>
        <p>The decision, Lindh v. Murphy, No. 96-6298, overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, and will have the effect of keeping hundreds if not thousands of petitions that would otherwise have run aground on the new requirements.</p>
        <p>The law, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, took effect when President Clinton signed it on April 24. The law greatly circumscribes the traditional role of the Federal courts in reviewing prisoners' arguments, through habeas corpus petitions, that their convictions or sentences violate the Constitution.</p>
        <p>Constitutional challenges to the substance of the law are pending in lower courts. In the case today, an appeal by a convicted murderer in Wisconsin based on his inability to cross-examine the state's expert psychiatric witness at his trial, the Supreme Court had agreed to decide only the retroactivity question. Congress was silent on whether the general provisions of the law applied to pending cases.</p>
        <p>Justice Souter's opinion reasoned from what he called the ''negative inference'' that Congress did not intend the relevant sections of the law to apply retroactively, because a separate section that applies to death-row inmates, not at issue in the case today, was explicitly made applicable to all pending cases in the text of the statute.</p>
        <p>Justice Souter acknowledged that the case was hard. ''No answer leaps out at us,'' he said. ''All we can say is that in a world of silk purses and pigs' ears, the act is not a silk purse of the art of statutory drafting.''</p>
        <p>His opinion was joined by Justices O'Connor, Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer.</p>
        <p>In a dissenting opinion, Chief Justice Rehnquist called the inference on which the majority relied weak and strained. Justices Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas joined the dissent.</p>
        <p>State Immunity</p>
        <p>In a splintered ruling in the oldest case on its docket, the Court enlarged the dimensions of constitutional immunity for states from suits in Federal court but did not go as far in that direction as Justice Kennedy and Chief Justice Rehnquist evidently wanted to go.</p>
        <p>The question in Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe, No. 94-1474, was whether the state could be sued in Federal court in a dispute over ownership to the bed of a lake, part of which is on an Indian reservation. The 11th Amendment generally bars suits against states in Federal court.</p>
        <p>But under a Supreme Court decision in 1980 called Ex Parte Young, state officials may be sued to bar them from enforcing state laws that are said to be unconstitutional. The Ex Parte Young doctrine, in effect a legal fiction based on the theory that the suit is not really against the state, has been under attack from states and from their allies on the Court.</p>
        <p>In this case, Idaho appealed a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, that permitted the Indians' suit to proceed against state officials under the Ex Parte Young doctrine. In overturning that decision today, five Justices -- Justice Kennedy, the Chief Justice and Justices O'Connor, Scalia and Thomas -- agreed that the suit bore too directly and intrusively on Idaho's ''sovereign interest in its lands and waters'' to be permitted to proceed.</p>
        <p>Justice Kennedy wrote the opinion. But only Chief Justice Rehnquist joined him in the sections that would have replaced the general outlines of Ex Parte Young with a case-by-case balancing test that would have greatly limited the doctrine's usefulness in suing states in Federal court at all. That result was blocked by Justice O'Connor's concurring opinion.</p>
        <p>Justice Souter wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Stevens, Ginsburg and Breyer. Justice Souter expressed ''great satisfaction'' that Justice O'Connor's more limited view had prevailed over Justice Kennedy's view, but said the suit should have been permitted to proceed.</p>
        <p>Native Alaskan Rights</p>
        <p>The Court agreed to hear an appeal by Alaska from a ruling of the Ninth Circuit that a remote village of 350 Athabaskan Indians is sovereign ''Indian country,'' with broad powers to impose taxes and control land use and resources over an area the size of Delaware.</p>
        <p>Alaska told the Court that the Ninth Circuit decision, growing out of a minor tax dispute, called into question the status of 44 million acres of  Indian-owned land, or 10 percent of the state, which had not previously been regarded as Indian territory, as that phrase is used to describe the sovereign rights of Indians who live on reservations in the lower 48 states.</p>
        <p>A 1971 Federal law, the Alaskan Native Claims Settlement Act, extinguished historic Indian titles to land in exchange for a cash payment and new political arrangements. The case, Alaska v. Native Village of Venetie, No. 96-1577, will require the Court to examine that law and other facets of Alaskan history.</p>
