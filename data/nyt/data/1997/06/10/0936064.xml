        <p>Many of the 600 or so guests who gathered on Sunday night to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Theological Faculty of Jagiellonian University are old friends and former colleagues of Karol Wojtyla, the onetime Archbishop of Cracow who left in 1978 to become Pope John Paul II.</p>
        <p>In many ways, these members of Cracow's intellectual elite have remained his toughest judges, applying the standards he set for himself as an energetic and inquiring student, seminarian and priest.</p>
        <p>And on his current visit to Poland -- far more than the last one, six years ago -- the Pope has reminded these old friends of that young man with interests far beyond politics.</p>
        <p>The man they remember studied philosophy, wrote plays and poetry and hiked in the mountains, even as he began testing limits imposed first by Poland's Nazi occupiers and later by its Communist rulers.</p>
        <p>As on other return trips -- this is his seventh -- the Pope has reminisced openly, making no secret of his homesickness for Poland.</p>
        <p>''Every return to Poland is like a return under the roof of the parental home, where every little object reminds me of what is closest and dearest,'' he said several days ago.</p>
        <p>But when he came to Cracow in 1991, many admirers felt that he had been given bad advice by Polish clerics, and that as a result he adopted a narrowly focused, combative tone about the dangers of a permissive society that struck a false note.</p>
        <p>This time, with parliamentary elections coming in the fall, the Pope's visit could easily have become a weapon in the local church's battle with the current Government, made up of former Communists.</p>
        <p>Now, on the eve of his departure for Rome, many here say that on this trip the Pope avoided the confrontational tone he used in the past. Except for a strong attack on abortion, which he speaks about everywhere, and an equally strong defense of the use of Catholic symbols in public places, Pope John Paul largely kept his spiritual message away from politics.</p>
        <p>In a letter addressed to Polish bishops, the Pope clearly urged them to leave politics, economics and culture to the lay members of the church. The church may offer its believers spiritual guidance, he said, but should not take on their role.</p>
        <p>Jacek Wozniakowski, who as editor of the journal Znak accepted articles from the priest who is now the Pope, said that at first Father Wojtyla had been reluctant to take part in local affairs.</p>
        <p>''I remember we had to convince him he had to read the press at a time when all he was reading was his mystics and his romantic writers whom he knew very well,'' Mr. Wozniakowski said. ''He used to say that the press should be read by people who are involved in politics, and that wasn't him.''</p>
        <p>As Cracow's Archbishop, he became more involved, stepping into continuing battles with the Communist authorities over permission to open new churches and educate more priests -- and defending his flock when no one else would.</p>
        <p>''All along he has thought that if the church mixes in politics, it should only be because there is no one else to perform the task,'' Mr. Wozniakowski said. ''Now he is very keen to see the church going back to its proper work, which is to be a spiritual guide.</p>
        <p>''He feels, of course, that politics should be imbued with moral values, but he understands there are those among the clergy who mix in politics much too much.''</p>
