        <p>It wasn't the proverbial indisposition that made Janet Orenstein, the violinist of the Guild Trio, miss the group's concert on Sunday afternoon at Kaye Playhouse.</p>
        <p>Ms. Orenstein is expecting a baby this summer and has been advised not to travel. So the violinist Sunghae Anna Lim substituted on short notice, joining the regulars of this Philadelphia-based trio: Patricia Tao, a pianist, and Brooks Whitehouse, a cellist. Understandably, given the circumstances, the playing was sometimes unsettled and not ideally balanced. The program, all dances or works inspired by dances, required a unanimity of stylistic thinking that was not always evident.</p>

        <p>It wasn't the proverbial indisposition that made Janet Orenstein, the violinist of the Guild Trio, miss the group's concert on Sunday afternoon at Kaye Playhouse.</p>
        <p>Ms. Orenstein is expecting a baby this summer and has been advised not to travel. So the violinist Sunghae Anna Lim substituted on short notice, joining the regulars of this Philadelphia-based trio: Patricia Tao, a pianist, and Brooks Whitehouse, a cellist. Understandably, given the circumstances, the playing was sometimes unsettled and not ideally balanced. The program, all dances or works inspired by dances, required a unanimity of stylistic thinking that was not always evident.</p>
        <p>The concert began with five familiar waltzes and mazurkas by Chopin arranged for piano trio by Peter Winkler. It takes a tasteful pianist to make them sound like the inventive, mercurial works they are. But as arranged and played here, they sounded like cocktail music. Ms. Lin's throbbing sound did not help.</p>
        <p>A work by William Bolcom, ''Spring Trio: A Bouquet of Traditional Flower Rags,'' commissioned by the Guild Trio, had its New York premiere. You have to listen closely to realize what subversive things are going on just below the breezy surfaces of Mr. Bolcom's rags: bass notes that don't always mesh with the music they undergird; simple-sounding phrases that go on at odd lengths; harmonies that turn wayward and melancholic. Though the performances were a bit tentative, the beguiling music came through.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winkler was also represented by a recent work, Nine Waltzes. He begins with something Brahmsian, then subjects the waltz form to manipulations: one fractures the oom-pah-pah device beyond comprehension; another turns all atonal and compressed, like some intense waltz by Webern; the last is skittish and wild, like wired Ravel. They were nicely conceived and elicited musicianly and satisfying performances.</p>
        <p>Three sultry tangos by Astor Piazzolla ended the concert.</p>
        <p>For all the charm of these dance works, they tended to cancel one another other out. The Bolcom rags, for example, would sound refreshing on a program with more soberly substantive works. But here its ingenuities got lost amid 90 minutes of evoked and deconstructed dances.</p>
