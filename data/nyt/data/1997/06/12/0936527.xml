        <p>The accounts of two pharmaceutical brands being acquired by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc. from units of Johnson &amp; Johnson have been awarded to W. B. Doner &amp; Company in Southfield, Mich., a roster agency of Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn.</p>
        <p>Doner was named to handle the Micatin line of antifungal products, which had been handled by the McCann-Erickson Worldwide unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York. Though billings were not disclosed, Advertising Age estimated them at $9.5 million. Doner was also awarded the Pediacare line of cough and cold products for children, which had been handled by Susan Spindler Advertising in Weston, Conn. Billings were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The two brands were among several swapped last week by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn and Johnson &amp; Johnson. Doner will lose the account of one brand, Motrin pain reliever, acquired by the McNeil Consumer Products unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson from Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn. Advertising Age, which estimated Motrin spending last year at $16.6 million, reported that Motrin might be shifted to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Health Care Connection, a unit of Cordiant P.L.C. in New York, or Ammirati Puris Lintas in New York, an Interpublic agency.</p>
