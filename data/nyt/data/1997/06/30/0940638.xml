      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In Patti LaBelle's Carnegie Hall concert on Saturday night, 80 minutes and 3 outfits long, the power points arrived when she touched her fans. Ms. LaBelle continually accepted flowers and cards from the audience throughout the show, and she knows how to say thank you.</p>
        <p>Approaching her idolaters at the lip of the stage, she began directing the song at them as a vague totality. Drawing closer, she kept them at bay as they extended their gifts, redoubling the intensity of a lyric, going through a theatrical ''do you really want me?'' routine. Finally, taking hold of one outstretched hand, staring at an enraptured face, she began an improvised gospel aria; her music director shut the nine-piece band down, and Ms. LaBelle let it rip with supreme force, imprecating and pleading until the whole crowd rose to its feet.</p>

        <p>In Patti LaBelle's Carnegie Hall concert on Saturday night, 80 minutes and 3 outfits long, the power points arrived when she touched her fans. Ms. LaBelle continually accepted flowers and cards from the audience throughout the show, and she knows how to say thank you.</p>
        <p>Approaching her idolaters at the lip of the stage, she began directing the song at them as a vague totality. Drawing closer, she kept them at bay as they extended their gifts, redoubling the intensity of a lyric, going through a theatrical ''do you really want me?'' routine. Finally, taking hold of one outstretched hand, staring at an enraptured face, she began an improvised gospel aria; her music director shut the nine-piece band down, and Ms. LaBelle let it rip with supreme force, imprecating and pleading until the whole crowd rose to its feet.</p>
        <p>She milked the audience for every drop of love; at the beginning of the show, she sang for several minutes before even emerging (through double doors at center stage surrounded by columns). But her follow-through was super sized. Stepping into her role as spokeswoman for the National Minority AIDS Council, she gave a speech on the dangers of homophobia and racism, standing between black and white grand pianos. She let seven fans rush the stage at one point, encouraging each of them to sing a line. When one fan gave her the vest off her back, she returned the gift by picking a lily from the vase sitting on the black piano and offering it to him.</p>
        <p>The concert, part of the JVC Jazz Festival, was a full retrospective, with old hits worked into medleys, other people's hits (Toni Braxton's ''Unbreak My Heart,'' Eric Carmen's ''All by Myself'') and only a few songs from her new album, ''Flame'' (MCA). It was a ritualized show; the tolerance lecture is a constant, as was a story about her sister Jackie dying of cancer before Ms. LaBelle was able to tell her she loved her. But she has a roving energy that compels her to find surprises in songs, and because there were so many unaccompanied sections, forcing her into new inventions of rhythm and phrasing and drama, her immaculately planned concert was anything but rote.</p>
