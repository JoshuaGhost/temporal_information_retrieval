        <p>About 15 million gallons of raw sewage has spilled into the Hudson River from a broken pipeline near Tarrytown, N.Y., since last week, and today Gov. Christine Todd Whitman lashed out at New York officials, saying that they failed to notify New Jersey about it.</p>
        <p>In a statement, Mrs. Whitman complained that the state had not been officially notified of the discharge until today, five days after the accident occurred. ''We should have been notified immediately of the pumping station break,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The notification from the Interstate Sanitation Commission, which oversees sanitation in the three-state region, came after New Jersey officials had already learned late Tuesday evening that some beaches along the Hudson River in New York were closed.</p>
        <p>''We were left to discover the environmental emergency for ourselves,'' Mrs. Whitman said.</p>
        <p>Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, said 10 million gallons of sewage flowed directly into the river from last Friday until today, after a leak was discovered in a pipe at the plant.</p>
        <p>Chlorine was added to the dumped sewage and boats were dispatched to skim floating debris, Mr. Sheffer said. Westchester officials posted notices warning of contamination at marinas and beaches, he said.</p>
        <p>The Federal Environmental Protection Agency was notified immediately after the dumping began, Mr. Sheffer said. But the Westchester County Department of Health apparently did not notify the Interstate Sanitation Commission, which acts as a regulatory body for sewage pollution in waters shared by New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, Mr. Sheffer said.</p>
        <p>The commission was first notified today, he said, adding, ''We're looking into that.''</p>
        <p>Repairs were under way at the plant tonight, he said.</p>
        <p>In February, Mrs. Whitman halted a scheduled dumping of 560 million gallons of New York City sewage into the Hudson when she learned of it less than 24 hours before it was to occur. She insisted that to allow officials to take steps to protect natural resources, the state should be notified far in advance of scheduled dumpings and promptly told of accidental discharges.</p>
        <p>Although the sewage from Tarrytown is not expected to affect New Jersey's beaches or shellfish beds, Mrs. Whitman used the opportunity to scold New York for negligence. ''I thought we had reached an understanding about prompt notification after the last incident with New York City in February,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The spill was relatively small by past standards, he said, but still should be seen as a potentially serious problem because of the tidal nature of the lower Hudson. ''It may seem like a big river, but sewage can get in and collect and collect and collect in bays and backwaters. The river doesn't flow in one direction and flush things out.''</p>
        <p>Several New York State officials expressed dismay at the tone of Mrs. Whitman's comments, saying that New Jersey had had its share of pollution accidents along the river and in New York Harbor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cronin said officials in both states have to do a better job of making sure sewage plants do not break down. ''All of these incidents are avoidable,'' Mr. Cronin said.</p>
