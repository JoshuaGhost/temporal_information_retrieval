        <p>''DOES it seem like the New York area could use a new kind of shopping experience?''</p>
        <p>The ads are aimed at New Yorkers and hit them where they live -- in the subways and on the street.</p>
        <p>The challenger? Target Greatland -- the first branch of the giant Midwestern chain near New York City. Target, the largest division of Dayton Hudson Corporation, operates 769 stores in 39 states. The store, which opened in Menlo Park, N.J., this spring with 130,000 square feet, is the discount answer to the department store experience.</p>
        <p>At the same time that it enters the New York market, Target is raising its profile in another important way. The company has created a $5 million fund -- including $1 million of its own money -- to restore the Washington Monument, beginning early next year. Because the monument  could be under wraps until the year 2000, Target has commissioned the architect Michael Graves to design its scaffolding.</p>
        <p>All of which should have more and more people asking, what does Target have that New York, a design shopping heaven, doesn't? The store's claim is ''wide aisles, friendly salespeople, brands you know, and prices you'll love.'' In other words, a suburban shopping experience that savvy New Yorkers never knew they wanted.</p>
        <p>Target offers everything from pantyhose to diapers. But could it provide stylish housewares at prices worth the hour's drive -- in a driving rainstorm -- from midtown?</p>
        <p>Target Greatland is billing itself as the giant with good household taste. The selection of small, name-brand kitchen appliances, dinnerware, linens, lighting and other home accessories is extensive and aggressively well priced.</p>
        <p>Much of the merchandise looks almost identical to what's offered at stores like Crate and Barrel, Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma. The biggest difference is price. (Target is a mass merchant, however, and there's a lot to wade through.)</p>
        <p>According to Bridget Tweedie, Target's home merchandising trend manager, many of the product designs are the same -- and from the same manufacturers.</p>
        <p>And Target's buyers shop the European trade shows, giving some validity to wags' pronunciation of the store name -- tar-ZHAY. Want a stainless steel table lamp with a beaded shade, so popular in the Pottery Barn catalogue this year for $149? A suspiciously similar model sells at Target for $29.99. Those translucent wastebaskets seen at Bed, Bath and Beyond? Target's offerings are not the same brand, but they're cheaper. The black-handled, stainless steel bistro-style flatware set for $24.99 (service for four) was indistinguishable from the set sold at Williams-Sonoma for $60.</p>
        <p>Tekki Allen, who was shopping with her 2-year-old daughter, Quinlan, lives 15 minutes away in Rahway, N.J. She walked out with $100 worth of housewares, ''and did my whole kitchen over,'' she said, no mean feat.</p>
        <p>Other metropolitan area mass-marketers like Ikea offer child care, but Target is taking care of itself and children by offering them pint-size shopping carts.</p>
        <p>Quinlan's cart was full by the time she got to check out. She thought she could buy everything. ''I let her spend $5 on a red cheerleader's pompom and some hangers,'' Ms. Allen said. Another successful impulse buy for Target.</p>
        <p>The discount giant aims to be gentle, too -- without the abrasiveness New Yorkers love to hate. Euphemisms may make Manhattanites feel as if they'd walked into a rest home, not a retail store. Customers are ''guests.'' Employees are ''team members.'' Have a question? Pick up a phone at a ''guest amenity kiosk'' and within seconds a solicitous ''team member'' arrives -- not with little pink pills but with an answer to almost any question.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, they're one thing you can't bring back to New York -- yet. Target has plans for 40 to 45 stores in the New York City area.</p>
