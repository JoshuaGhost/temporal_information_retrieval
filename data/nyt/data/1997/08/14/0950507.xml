        <p>In another attempt to fill the void for a right-handed designated hitter that arose when Cecil Fielder injured his thumb last month, the Yankees reacquired Mike Stanley in a trade with the Boston Red Sox yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Yankees acquired the 34-year-old Stanley and the minor league infielder Randy Brown for Tony Armas, a 19-year-old right-handed pitcher, and a player from the Yankees' 40-man roster to be named later.</p>
        <p>General Manager Bob Watson jokingly said he made the trade because Stanley's cerebral approach to hitting reminded Watson of himself and of Manager Joe Torre.</p>
        <p>What Watson has to hope is that Stanley will remind New Yorkers of the player whose power-laden, opposite-field swing made Yankee Stadium look downright cozy in the four seasons he played there before departing as a free agent in December 1995. If he does that, Stanley could help the Yankees improve against left-handed pitchers. The Yankees are 20-18 against left-handers this year, compared with 50-30 against right-handers.</p>
        <p>The Yankees made the deal after a spirited internal debate over whether to mortgage part of their future, which they admittedly did by including Armas, who was considered too precious to deal away just one week ago.</p>
        <p>''We had about seven or eight names on that list of untouchables and this young man was on that list,'' Watson said of Armas, whose father, Tony Armas, hit 43 home runs for Boston in 1984. ''But this shows you what we are all about when we say we are committed to winning. My position is, if it makes good baseball sense and good economic sense, go ahead and do it.''</p>
        <p>Watson, explaining the change in philosophy, said, ''I felt adding another quality right-handed bat would give Joe Torre the weapons he needs to take a real, real serious run and send the message to the rest of the league, especially the people that we are chasing, the fans and the media that the Yankees are in this to win the whole thing.''</p>
        <p>Before Tim Raines drove in a run against Kansas City yesterday, the Yankees had gone 19 games and 73 at-bats without a run batted in from a designated hitter -- left-handed or right-handed.</p>
        <p>Watson said the Yankees would try to sign Stanley beyond this season. Stanley, a career .273 hitter with 122 home runs, has 13 home runs and 53 r.b.i. in 260 at-bats with the Red Sox this season.</p>
        <p>''We've needed a right-handed at-bat,'' said Torre, who will use Stanley as a designated hitter, as a backup for first baseman Tino Martinez and as an emergency catcher behind Joe Girardi and Jorge Posada.</p>
        <p>Watson said he changed his thinking about holding onto prospects during the Yankees' 6-2 road trip. One of the losses was to the Texas left-hander Darren Oliver.</p>
        <p>Watson also was concerned about the remaining schedule, in which the Yankees could face tough left-handers such as Seattle's Randy Johnson, Jamie Moyer and Jeff Fassero; Anaheim's Chuck Finley and Allen Watson, and Baltimore's Jimmy Key. ''I wanted to give Joe the best chance to win and in making the move, I think we have a running shot at it now,'' Watson said.</p>
