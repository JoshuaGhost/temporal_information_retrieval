        <p>Shareholders of the Student Loan Marketing Association ousted the management yesterday by electing a dissident slate of directors to run the company, ending a protracted, bitter struggle over its strategy.</p>
        <p>Jonathan E. Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company, called the vote ''the stock market equivalent of the Boston Tea Party; it's a revolution.'' The company's shares surged in response to the vote.</p>
        <p>Shareholders also overwhelmingly approved a plan to turn Sallie Mae, as the company is known, into a fully private, state-chartered corporation. Since its creation in 1973, Sallie Mae has been a Government-sponsored enterprise, though it has been partly privatized since then.</p>
        <p>While both sides favored full privatization, yesterday's votes culminated a two-year battle over how the company, which buys and services student loans, should conduct its business. On the one side was  Sallie Mae's management, and on the other, a group of directors who have called themselves the Committee to Restore Value.</p>
        <p>Currently, the company benefits from its quasi-public status by borrowing at below-market interest rates with Government guarantees to buy repackaged loans from banks, though it does not directly issue loans. Under the dissidents' plan, Sallie Mae will now compete with banks by making loans directly to students and schools.</p>
        <p>The current management wanted to maintain the lending approach but also wanted to enter other businesses, such as servicing consumer loans, providing back-office processing and computer software services.</p>
        <p>''Sallie Mae shareholders have made their choice regarding the future leadership and direction of Sallie Mae,'' said William Arceneaux, the current chairman of Sallie Mae,  and he pledged to cooperate with the newly elected board to achieve a smooth transition to the new corporate structure.</p>
        <p>The dissident group is led by Albert L. Lord, a former chief operating officer and chief executive at Sallie Mae and current board member. Mr. Lord, who left Sallie Mae in 1994, will return as chief executive. Edward A. Fox, who served as president and chief executive of Sallie Mae from 1973 until 1990, will become chairman.</p>
        <p>The struggle over Sallie Mae's future began at a time when the company's stock price was languishing in the mid-$30's, roughly half the level it was when Mr. Lord left the company.</p>
        <p>Following a bitter proxy fight in 1995, Mr. Lord and eight of his associates were elected to the board. Shortly thereafter, Sallie Mae began carrying out a number of recommendations made by the new board members, changes that included deep cuts in expenses and a stock buyback program.</p>
        <p>Helped by those changes, for which both sides take credit, Sallie Mae's stock has quintupled in value since 1995.</p>
        <p>''It is unprecendented in corporate America for shareholders to replace a management team whose stock has gone up five times in the last two years,'' said Steven Eisman, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Final figures of the vote to oust the management were not available, and the results will need to be certified, a process that could take as long as a week. But according to preliminary results, the dissident group received nearly 58 percent of the 44 million proxies cast.</p>
        <p>The outcome was greeted with a hearty endorsement from Wall Street. On the New York Stock Exchange, Sallie Mae's shares rose $4.8125, to $149.9375.</p>
        <p>The company's surging stock price was reflective of its solid financial position.</p>
        <p>Last month Sallie Mae said that second quarter net income rose 16 percent from levels a year earlier, to $119.2 million, or $2.20 a share. At the end of June, the company's portfolio of student loans stood at $41.5 billion, up 11 percent from the same period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Sallie Mae's current management attempted to take credit for many of the changes of the last two years, but analysts said developments at the company in recent weeks did little to instill confidence among investors that the executives had a clear idea of how to move the company forward.</p>
        <p>Indicative of what they characterized as disarray was the announcement on June 11 that Lawrence A. Hough would step down as Sallie Mae's chief executive as soon as a successor could be found.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Hough said the idea to resign was his own and was done to seek an end to the stalemate between the dissidents and management, analysts said a number of large institutional shareholders had insisted that Mr. Hough step aside.</p>
        <p>The management shake-up made a deep impression on David Drake, director of the proxy advisory service at Institutional Shareholder Services, the nation's largest proxy advisory firm.</p>
        <p>As recently as May, Mr. Drake had issued a report supporting current management.</p>
        <p>But last week he changed his mind, and strongly endorsed the dissident slate.</p>
        <p>''When I sat down and re-evaluated the situation, I thought the dissident slate already has a lot of experience with this company and that they were already dictating strategy from their minority position,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''When I talked to management, they never denied that. And when Mr. Hough resigned, it eroded management stability, which had been a major reason I had supported them before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisman at Oppenheimer said the Institutional Shareholder Services recommendation ''was a major step, and Hough's resignation was a strategic error.''</p>
        <p>''This is the culmination of what has been an incredibly long, convoluted and exciting story,'' he said.</p>
