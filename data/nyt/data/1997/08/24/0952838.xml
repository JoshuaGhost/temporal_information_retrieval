        <p>While he celebrated Triple Crown rivals stayed home to mend their battle damage, Deputy Commander raced to stardom today when he won the 128th Travers Stakes by a nose over Behrens, with the favored Awesome Again third in a field of eight career-building colts.</p>

        <p>While he celebrated Triple Crown rivals stayed home to mend their battle damage, Deputy Commander raced to stardom today when he won the 128th Travers Stakes by a nose over Behrens, with the favored Awesome Again third in a field of eight career-building colts.</p>
        <p>It was only the third time in his own career that Deputy Commander had won, but his timing was dramatic. He is large, inexperienced, high-strung and headstrong, and he was still learning the rules of the road while the Triple Crown was being contested so fiercely last spring by Silver Charm, Touch Gold and Free House.</p>
        <p>But he surfaced last month when he ran second to Free House in the Swaps Stakes, and today he stuck his nose in front at the finish to win a race with no Triple Crown alumni.</p>
        <p>To add to the drama, he was ridden by Chris McCarron, the regular rider on Touch Gold, who was withdrawn from the Travers with a cut left front hoof. And McCarron, after switching to Deputy Commander, learned Tuesday night that his mother had died after a long illness. So, he flew from California to Massachusetts for her funeral on Friday, and appeared shaken and weeping today at Saratoga for his first ride in four days.</p>
        <p>''When I got the news Tuesday, I was a little selfish,'' McCarron said. ''I called home and put some of the burden on my family, and they all gave me their blessing. They told me that if she had anything to do with this, she'll give us a little boost. Sure enough, I could feel her presence.''</p>
        <p>The entire team surrounding Deputy Commander, in fact, arrived at Saratoga from different directions at different times, all of them late. The colt and the trainer, Wally Dollase, flew here from California only two days ago. And for Dollase, it was the first time he had ever run a horse at Saratoga.</p>
        <p>''I had questioned whether the horse could go a mile and a quarter,'' the trainer admitted. ''I also was worried about the weather and the track. We wouldn't even have run if Touch Gold had stayed in the race. I didn't think he could beat Touch Gold right now.''</p>
        <p>But McCarron rode a strategic race, stalking the long shot Twin Spires and then Affirmed Success. They ran the mile in 1:364/5 , and then McCarron struck, moving from third place to first at the head of the homestretch. But he still had to outrun Behrens in a two-horse fight to the finish, which Deputy Commander won by the length of his nose.</p>
        <p>''When we hit the turn heading for home,'' McCarron said, ''his left ear went up. It was a sign that he had more run in him. And he did. About two strides from the wire, I felt I was going to win. At the wire, I felt it was a bob of the head.''</p>
        <p>David Hofmans, who trains both Touch Gold and Awesome Again, found no fault with his understudy's performance. But Mike Smith, who rode him, said: ''I really didn't have a good trip. We were stuck the whole way around, and it was too much to overcome. The winner forced us out, and we got caught wide.''</p>
        <p>Deputy Commander, a son of Deputy Minister owned by the Mandysland Farm and Michael Jarvis, ran the mile and one-quarter in 2:04, paid $10 for a $2 bet to win and earned $450,000. The race was run on a fast track after torrential thunderstorms the night before, prompting Dollase to salute Don Orlando, the track superintendent, in these words: ''Whatever this gentleman did to this track was phenomenal.''</p>
        <p>Two races before the Travers, in one of her cameo appearances since withdrawing from New York racing earlier this year, Julie Krone made a smashing return visit when she rode Tale of the Cat to victory by 5 1/2 lengths in the King's Bishop Stakes for 3-year-olds.</p>
        <p>It was only the fourth race in the career of the Storm Cat colt, who ran fourth behind Touch Gold in the Haskell Invitational four weeks ago. But he led almost all the way with a blistering pace, ran three-quarters of a mile in 1:082/5  and finished the seven furlongs in 1:213/5  with Oro de Mexico second and, nine lengths back, Trafalgar in third place.</p>
        <p>''He's a real push-button little horse,'' Krone said. ''I knew we must have been flying when we were in front of all those horses.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Gov. GEORGE E. PATAKI, who presented the trophy to the Travers winner, earlier in the day signed a bill extending for seven years the franchise of the New York Racing Association. The franchise was to have ended in the year 2000, but now will run through 2007, with the Governor mandating stricter controls, annual audits, bidding rules on contracts and five additional appointments to the board of trustees. The state Senate has promised that it will vote amendments to the law for the controls when it returns from recess. . . . A 40-day Saratoga season, the longest in its 129-year history, has been proposed to the state by the N.Y.R.A. for next year. The meeting would open two days later than it did this year, on Friday, July 24, and run through Labor Day, Sept. 7.</p>
