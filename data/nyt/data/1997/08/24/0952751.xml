        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Those of us born during the Depression who couldn't attend college without working and scholarship aid, who couldn't live in New York City without three roommates, who couldn't work in our chosen professions except as secretaries, and who retired without a company pension are anything but insulted or ''cruelly seduced'' by senior discounts. Such perks not only provide financial help; they also represent rewards for years of hard work and sacrifice.</p>
