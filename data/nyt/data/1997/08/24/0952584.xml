        <p>ALONG St. Joseph's Avenue, once a respectable neighborhood of working-class families here, bare-chested men now occupy the street corners like sentries on a watch.

        <p>ALONG St. Joseph's Avenue, once a respectable neighborhood of working-class families here, bare-chested men now occupy the street corners like sentries on a watch. Among the burned-out buildings, the weeds where gardens thrived, rubbish on the streets and abandoned mattresses along the sidewalks, they snarl at passers-by and while away the long, hot summer days.</p>
        <p>Mulford Gardens, built in 1937 as a model federally subsidized apartment complex, is still the focal point of this tough riverfront neighborhood -- except that over time, what was once a community's proud centerpiece has become its shame. Graffiti is everywhere, along with a robust crack cocaine trade, the police say.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, the apartments were a first stop for hard-working families who would eventually save enough money to buy houses of their own. Alexander G. Votta, a Yonkers resident who is now 80, remembered it as a stylish place to live in the early 1940's, and a good place to raise a family.</p>
        <p>But by the 1950's, the economic landscape began to change as jobs dried up at the local carpet mill. When an elevator manufacturing plant also cut back production, some residents moved away in search of other opportunities. Many who stayed behind went on the public dole. Today, a few roses still grow outside the 125-year-old Sisters of Charity convent next door to Mulford Gardens, although armed robberies, pit bull fights and unrelenting poverty occlude most memories of a better past.</p>
        <p>It is a neighborhood where boys learn to be tough according to the unforgiving rules of the street, where bodega owners barely eke out a living and customers pay with food stamps, where most mothers will not let young children play outside and the elderly are too fearful to leave home even to attend mass.</p>
        <p>According to census data for 1990, 38 percent of the neighborhood's population lives below the poverty level.</p>
        <p>''It breaks my heart to see the problems here,'' said Abraham Santiago, a deacon for 25 years at St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church. For Mr. Santiago, it has become a neighborhood of lost souls.</p>
        <p>To the police, it is Yonkers's Fourth Precinct -- and one of the toughest areas in the city. Capt. Patrick J. McMahon of the precinct called it ''ground zero.''</p>
        <p>''We see everything here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>From the perspective of determined municipal officials, the Ashburton Avenue Corridor, as it is also known, has become a part of the city needing to be reclaimed.</p>
        <p>Yonkers has applied for a $27 million Federal Housing and Urban Development grant to rejuvenate the area. Similar Federal projects in poor neighborhoods are under way in Detroit, Hartford and Newark, among other places.</p>
        <p>Bruce Harmon, a housing consultant for Yonkers, who also worked in Hartford and Newark, explained that the recent round of Federal grants is fueled by the idea of rebuilding down-and-out neighborhoods by teaching poor residents how to better themselves.</p>
        <p>''Instead of just looking at changing the housing, as it did in the past, the Federal Government is now also looking at changing the lives of the people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Joe L. Farmer, Special Assistant for Housing and Community Redevelopment to Mayor John D. Spencer, explained that rather than raze blighted housing, the idea was to ''try and build things up again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer is charged with carrying out the second phase of a Federal Court order, issued in the late 1980's, to desegregate the state's fourth-largest city by creating 600 units of affordable housing for prospective low-  and moderate-income home buyers.</p>
        <p>Part of the plan calls for creating 146 units of affordable housing for minority groups on the city's predominantly white east side, and that is under way. But the order also calls for improving the quality of life in southwest Yonkers, where mostly minorities live.</p>
        <p>The area that includes Mulford Gardens is perhaps Westchester's poorest. Known as United States Census Track 5, the median household income is $9,306.</p>
        <p>It was once a predominantly Irish-American neighborhood of one-  and two-family houses with a ''smattering of Polish, Italians and Germans,'' said Lawrence Christopher, a member of the Housing Authority from 1952-68.</p>
        <p>Now the residents are predominantly black and Hispanic, with a third of the population speaking Spanish, the census data show.</p>
        <p>Of the 3,358 people older than 16, fewer than half are employed.</p>
        <p>Residents here -- Like Tony Sepulveda, who owns the Park Avenue Deli -- worry most about safety issues, studies made by the city show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sepulveda was robbed in June by two men with a sawed-off shotgun. It was 10:30 at night, near closing time for the 44-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, who rose that day at 4 to buy produce and supplies in the Bronx for his Spanish-speaking customers.</p>
        <p>He knows most of his clientele well, even their first name, and that night he thought he recognized the voices of his masked assailants.</p>
        <p>''Before they left, one of them said, 'Thanks, Poppy,' which is my nickname,'' Mr. Sepulveda recalled. ''They knew me.''</p>
        <p>In quick succession the next morning, there were three more armed robberies in the neighborhood by an assailant with a sawed-off shot gun, confounding the police who had cordoned off Mulford Gardens but failed to catch a suspect.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Salvatore J. DiMaggio, commander of the Yonkers Police Housing Unit, said the apartment's 70 exits and entrances and maze-like layout render it a difficult area to patrol. The complex is equally attractive to drug dealers and buyers who come from other neighborhoods to do business here, he said.</p>
        <p>When they make arrests, the police often encounter ''a lot of resisting -- kicking and biting and slashing with a razor,'' said Lieutenant DiMaggio, who described it as a perilous beat for officers.</p>
        <p>Although pets have been outlawed in the projects, the sound of dogfights continues. Last year, the police raided a pit bull and betting rink in the basement of Mulford Gardens that had been set up like a theater with video cameras. The police had to shoot the dogs, who turned on them as the raid began.</p>
        <p>In a park across the street from the complex, some residents described the neighborhood as dangerous, while others said it was safer than most in other cities.</p>
        <p>''By day, it's nice,'' said Fran Foltan, 52, who was relaxing on a park bench. ''But by night, this place becomes a jungle.''</p>
        <p>Margarita Santiago, 18, a single mother who is expecting a baby in September, described the neighborhood as ''better than the Bronx or Brooklyn, even though I would still never let my kids go out and play alone.''</p>
        <p>A 35-year-old single father of six, Frederick Cardwell, said he had chosen to raise his children in Mulford Gardens where he grew up. He said strict parenting and an emphasis on values would see his family through any difficulties.</p>
        <p>A caddie at a Scarsdale country club said that even if he could afford to leave the neighborhood, he would not. ''I like it here because it's never boring,'' Ernest Asiedu, 20, said. ''Even if I had a better job, I'd stay in the neighborhood, only in a house of my own.''</p>
        <p>As it is for Mr. Asiedu, home ownership is a dream of many residents here, said Peter Smith, executive director of the 2,609-unit Yonkers Municipal Housing Authority. A focus of the grant would be on rebuilding Mulford Gardens and assisting some residents to buy units there.</p>
        <p>''For most people in Westchester, finding housing can be difficult,'' he said, ''but for poor people it is extremely difficult.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Farmer, the special assistant to the Mayor, said that under income guidelines established for the renewal project, a family of four earning up to $71,600 a year would be eligible for assistance in buying a home or apartment along the Ashburton Avenue corridor.</p>
        <p>Under legislation pending in Congress, 65 percent of families admitted to public housing in a year could earn as much as 80 percent of the area's median income. The rest could earn no more than 30 percent of the median.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith of the Housing Authority said those guidelines, which are aimed at helping the working poor attain home ownership, could ''squeeze out the very poor.''</p>
        <p>''Then where would they go?'' he asked.</p>
