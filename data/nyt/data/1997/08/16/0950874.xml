        <p>Rapids Beat MetroStars</p>
        <p>Wolde Harris scored one goal and assisted on another last night as the Colorado Rapids defeated the MetroStars, 2-0, in Denver.</p>
        <p>Harris scored the game's first goal in the 74th minute, putting a penalty shot past MetroStars goalkeeper Tony Meola.</p>
        <p>Nine minutes later, MetroStars defender Branco was ejected after tackling a Colorado player from behind, sparking a fight.</p>

        <p>Vernon to Sharks?</p>
        <p>Detroit Red Wings goaltender Mike Vernon, winner of the Conn Smythe trophy as the 1997 playoff most valuable player, will be traded to the San Jose Sharks for draft picks, according to published reports.</p>
        <p>Booth News Service, in a report for today, cited National Hockey League sources who said the deal was completed late yesterday and could be announced today. Detroit would receive two second-round picks, the report said. The Detroit Free Press said final details were being ironed out late last night.</p>

        <p>GOLF</p>
        <p>Webb Leads in England</p>
        <p>Karrie Webb of Australia delivered another strong round yesterday, a two-under-par 70 for a total of 135, and was three strokes ahead halfway through the Women's British Open in Sunningdale, England. Kathryn Marshall of Scotland birdied the 18th from a bunker to tie Trish Johnson of England in second.</p>
        <p>The United States Open champion Alison Nicholas of Britain missed the cut after rounds of 75 and 74. It was the first time she missed the cut at the British Open, which she won in 1987. Also missing the cut with rounds of 77 and 79 was Nancy Lopez, who slipped on a wet log playing the 10th and hurt her knee and arm. Although she was not seriously injured, the fall affected her play. She had five bogeys on the back nine.</p>
        <p>Barbara Mucha of the United States shot a 67 for 139, and is four strokes behind Webb. One stroke back at 140 were the Americans Rosie Jones and Juli Inkster.</p>

The Wiz was runner-up, 1 3/4 lengths behind, followed by Instant Offense and Gifted Cowboy. Western Dreamer paid $2.10.</p>
        <p>Arturo, with Luc Ouellette, took the lead just after the first quarter pole and went on to a 1 1/2-length victory in the second elimination.

        <p>Wilson Wins Again</p>
        <p>Expanding on his lead at the midway point, Blaine Wilson made sure the only suspense was who would finish second.</p>
        <p>Wilson successfully defended his national all-around title, beating the veteran John Roethlisberger and 17-year-old Jason Gatson last night in the United States championships in Denver.</p>
        <p>Wilson, 23, of Columbus, Ohio, finished with 110.05 points. Gatson stayed second through five of the six events, but slipped to third with 106.55 points behind Roethlisberger, who had 106.85.</p>

        <p>Troy Aikman threw a touchdown pass; the rookie cornerback Kevin Mathis had a touchdown off an interception return and Herschel Walker showed he can still find the end zone as the Dallas Cowboys outlasted the visiting St. Louis Rams, 34-31, in a National Football League exhibition game last night.</p>
        <p>Emmitt Smith made his 1997 debut for Dallas but could gain only 24 yards on 12 carries.</p>
