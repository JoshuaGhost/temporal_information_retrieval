        <p>A doctor was charged with throwing a stillborn baby in the trash after delivering it at a neighborhood clinic, the police said.</p>
        <p>Two sanitation workers found the body in their truck on Thursday morning while they were compacting trash. An autopsy yesterday found it was a girl born eight months into the  pregnancy, Police Sgt. Derek Glenn of Newark said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Paraclet Louissaint delivered the baby at Lyons Medical Center on Monday, ''placed it in a plastic trash bag and threw it out with the regular office garbage,'' Prosecutor Clifford J. Minor of Essex County said yesterday. Dr. Louissaint was charged with improper disposal of regulated medical waste, Sergeant Glenn said.</p>
        <p>The charge is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine.</p>
        <p>The telephone at the clinic went unanswered yesterday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Louissaint's home telephone number is unlisted.</p>
