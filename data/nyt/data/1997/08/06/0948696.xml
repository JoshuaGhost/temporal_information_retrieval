        <p>GRACE DORIA and her husband, Joseph, the owners of Grace's Marketplace, at Third Avenue and 71st Street, have turned a former chiropractor's office next door into a restaurant. On Tuesday, they will open Grace's Trattoria, at 201 East 71st Street, a handsome brick-walled space with a pizza oven and an open kitchen.</p>
        <p>The chef, Franklin Becker, a native of Brooklyn, has yet to set foot in the Apulia region, which inspired the grilled baby octopus; orecchiette with broccoli rape and fennel, and sheep's-milk ricotta cheesecake on his menu, but he has had help from the Dorias, who are from that part of southern Italy. The restaurant's reasonably priced wines will be available Sept. 1. Until then, customers can bring their own to complement pastas priced from $15 to $19 and main courses from $16 to $23, at dinner.</p>
