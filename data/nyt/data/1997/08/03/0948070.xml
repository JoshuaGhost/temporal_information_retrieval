        <p>HISTORIC PRESERVATION is not just good for the eyes and heart it is good for the pocketbook,'' said David Listokin, a professor at the Center for Urban Policy Research of Rutgers University in New Brunswick.</p>
        <p>He was commenting on a recently released two-year study that he co-authored with Michael Lahur, another professor at the center.</p>
        <p>The 350-page report details the economic benefits, both direct and indirect, in New Jersey and nationally from such historic preservation activities as restoring and rehabilitating historic structures, heritage tourism and the operations of historic sites and organizations.</p>
        <p>State and national advocates say the report is the first to provide the hard numbers to substantiate what they say they knew all along -- that the dollars spent on historic preservation create jobs, promote tourism, increase property values and attract new investment.</p>
        <p>''For too long, and largely the fault of preservationists, the arguments for historic preservation have been soft, and about its 'touchy, feely' impacts,'' said Dovanan D. Rypkema, a real estate and economic development consultant in Washington. ''But what decision-makers want to know is how much will it cost and how much will it generate in revenue.''</p>
        <p>This study, he said, will help answer those questions and remove a weak spot in the growth of preservation.</p>
        <p>''It is a new source of ammunition for preservationists trying to leverage more room at the bargaining table, especially at a time of budget crunching,'' added Janice Wilson Stridick, president of the board of Preservation New Jersey, a statewide nonprofit advocacy group.</p>
        <p>The study showed that historic preservation activities generated $580 million annually in direct economic activity in the state. Using a multiplier effect, the report says that direct benefits on an annual basis translate into, among other things, 10,140 jobs, $263 million in payroll and business earnings and $293 million in local and state taxes.</p>
        <p>As part of those benefits, the report also says that historic properties in New Jersey, valued at $6 billion, pay $120 million in annual property taxes and have a higher market value because of their designation as historic sites. New Jersey has about 1,100 properties individually listed on the State and National Registers of Historic Places and thousands more in 240 historic districts, according to state figures.</p>
        <p>''There are real dollars to be made in historic preservation,'' said Professor Listokin, noting that its ''economic pump-priming effect'' was greater than some alternative investments. For example, the study reports, every $1 million spent on historic rehabilitation generates 38.3 jobs, $1.3 million in payroll and business earnings and $202,000 in state taxes, compared with 36 jobs, $1.2 million in income and $189,000 in taxes from new construction projects.</p>
        <p>The study also points out that 9.1 million tourists visit New Jersey's historic sites each year and spend $432 million. ''Heritage tourism is an area that has not been fully exploited in the state,'' said Professor Listokin.</p>
        <p>The $70,000 study was financed by state and Federal grants, notably from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training of the Federal Department of the Interior, which provided $40,000. The center is making the study available to other state historic preservation organizations and a summary of its highlights to targeted groups such as urban planners and developers, said Marc R. Gilberg, research coordinator at the center.</p>
        <p>THE report was done for the New Jersey Historic Trust, a quasi-public agency within the state's Department of Environmental Protection that awards matching grants to projects involving historic buildings owned by government agencies or nonprofit groups.</p>
        <p>Two projects in the state that received grants from the trust in recent years underscore the economic benefits of historic preservation.</p>
        <p>One is the Essex Club in Newark, a former gathering place for this city's business leaders. It overlooks Military Park and is not far from the New Jersey Performing Arts Center.</p>
        <p>The $1.25 million grant awarded by the trust was used to restore and convert the 1926 Georgian Revival structure into the headquarters of the New Jersey Historical Society. The work included creating a library, museum, office and classrooms in the building.</p>
        <p>Using the Rutgers study's model, the trust said the economic multiplier effects per $1 million of the estimated $3.8 million total construction cost of the Essex Club generated an estimated 73.4 jobs, $2.6 million in annual income and $266,000 in annual state taxes.</p>
        <p>''This building is part of the critical mass that is aiding the economic revitalization of downtown Newark,'' said Maureen Ogden, president of the Historical Society. Ms. Ogden, a former State Assemblywoman who now heads the Governor's Council on the Outdoors, added that the project ''could not be totally duplicated in a new building.''</p>
        <p>In nearby Jersey City's Van Vorst historic district, the Barrow Mansion, built in 1834, is a rare survivor of the city's antebellum era. A $311,375 grant from the trust was used to to restore the facade of the Greek Revival structure, as well as interior spaces. It is now used as offices by 20 community and nonprofit organizations.</p>
        <p>Using the Rutgers study's economic multiplier effects, each $1 million of the $2.1 million cost of the project would produce on average 40.5 jobs, $1.4 million in income and $147,000 in state taxes.</p>
        <p>''The project, which is ongoing, has been credited with spurring other restoration efforts in the neighborhood and in attracting people to live there,'' said Peter L. Jensen, president of the board of the Barrow Mansion Development Corporation, the nonprofit group working to preserve the building and promote its use as a community service center.</p>
        <p>The benefits are also evident in communities where historic preservation is linked with tourism. An example is Cape May, whose tourist industry thrives on the fact that it has more than 600 historic buildings, many of them Victorians for which the city is noted. Communities also look to historic preservation to help revive their downtowns.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Historic Trust is the only state agency to provide funds for ''bricks and mortar'' preservation projects. To be eligible for a grant a building must be owned by a government agency or a nonprofit group and be listed as a state or Federal landmark or be suitable for such a listing. The trust holds easements on land under the buildings that prohibit them from being demolished and insure public access for up to 20 years.</p>
        <p>UNDER its grant program, capitalized by $60 million set aside under 1987, 1992 and 1995 bond issues, the trust has awarded nearly $41 million in matching grants to 152 projects. It is now reviewing its last round of grants that can be financed from the bond issues.</p>
        <p>The agency has received 109 applications for more than three times the $11.5 million in grants it has left to spend, according to Harriet C. Hawkins, its executive director.</p>
        <p>She noted that the trust, which has a $3 million revolving fund for low-interest loans, was authorized to spend $4.5 million in administrative costs.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, efforts are advancing to find other ways to finance preservation projects. Ms. Ogden, chairwoman of the Governor's Council on the Outdoors, which advises the Governor on open-space and recreational issues, is recommending $15 million in financing for historic preservation.</p>
        <p>The request, part of the $200 million package that she expects to present to the Whitman administration by year's end, also includes funds for the conservation of farmland and open space.</p>
        <p>When the State Legislature convenes next month, it will consider a bill to provide tax credits to homeowners and businesses that rehabilitate historic properties in 100 municipalities that are classed as ''distressed.''</p>
        <p>The bill would offer a gross income, or corporate, tax credit equal to 25 percent of the cost of rehabilitating a property. Among the ''distressed'' municipalities are Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Camden and Trenton.</p>
