        <p>AN I.G.A. supermarket is scheduled to open this fall on the site of the former Gristede's store here on East Hartsdale Avenue, restoring an anchor for the downtown shopping district, a convenience for residents and a boost to other businesses.</p>
        <p>When Gristede's supermarket closed in December 1994, several of the businesses here struggled to retain customers. But an independent bookstore and an ice cream parlor closed.</p>
        <p>Now, the Greenburgh Town Supervisor, Paul J. Feiner, said: ''We really feel that East Hartsdale Avenue will have a renaissance. The supermarket gives us a great opportunity to turn around the street. You'll see the street turn around very fast. You need an anchor people like and enjoy, and then we'll be on our way.''</p>
        <p>The I.G.A. owner, Gabriel Scavello of the Bronx, who has more than 30 years' experience in the business, said: ''I'd been looking at the area for a couple of years. I like the location. ''</p>
        <p>The 6,000-square-foot supermarket, which has a 20-year lease at the site, will feature free delivery, telephone orders, catering and take-out services, an extensive delicatessen department and other amenities.</p>
        <p>On July 16, the Greenburgh Town Board approved hiring a concern to conduct a marketing study of the East Hartsdale Avenue district. The town is also exploring ways to improve the street's landscaping and overall appearance.</p>
        <p>''We want to take a street that has been boring and transform it into one  that's exciting,'' Mr. Feiner said. ''There's an awful lot of work that has to be done. If we don't keep up the momentum and get an interesting mix of stores, in five years we'll have the same trouble.''</p>
