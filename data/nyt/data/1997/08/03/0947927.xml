        <p>San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House, a 1932 Beaux-Arts landmark in the Civic Center, is scheduled to reopen next month after a two-year, $84.5 million renovation. The 3,176-seat auditorium will once again be the home of the San Francisco Opera and the San Francisco Ballet, both of which performed elsewhere during the renovation. The Opera House and its sister building, Veterans Auditorium, were the setting for the founding of the United Nations in 1945.</p>
        <p>The Opera House will be rededicated on Sept. 5. That night, the opera will inaugurate its 75th season with performances by Placido Domingo, Frederica von Stade and Marilyn Horne, among others. The sold-out performance will be simulcast live at Davies Symphony Hall, next door to the Opera House (tickets cost from $10 to $35), and a tape will be broadcast this fall as part of PBS's ''Great Performances'' series.</p>

        <p>The San Francisco Opera will offer free tours of its newly renovated facility as part of an Opera Fair on Sept. 6, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. On Sept. 7, at the company's annual Opera in the Park concert, principal singers from the season's first productions will perform. The free concert, which usually draws up to 20,000 picnicking fans, will begin at 1:30 P.M. at Sharon Meadow in Golden Gate Park.</p>
