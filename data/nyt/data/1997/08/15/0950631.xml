        <p>Letter from Allen Ellenzweig says Aug 10 article reprinted old quote from Allen Ginsberg that all members of Nazi Party were gay; says truth is that homosexuals suffered horrible persecution during Hitler's reign (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We should not let stand as the last word an old quote from Allen Ginsberg suggesting that ''Germany under Hitler'' showed early evidence of a political party made up of homosexuals (Week in Review, Aug. 10). Responding to a judge's prompting at the 1966 obscenity trial for William S. Burroughs's ''Naked Lunch,'' Ginsberg was perhaps being ironic or naive in repeating the popular canard that the Nazi party was a party of ''sex perverts.''</p>
        <p>Within weeks of Hitler's ascension to Chancellor in 1933, homosexual rights organizations were banned. The Reich's antigay program included restricting gay social life and then increasing penalties for same-sex activities until the death penalty was prescribed in 1941 for any German engaging in sexual activity with another man.</p>

        <p>We should not let stand as the last word an old quote from Allen Ginsberg suggesting that ''Germany under Hitler'' showed early evidence of a political party made up of homosexuals (Week in Review, Aug. 10). Responding to a judge's prompting at the 1966 obscenity trial for William S. Burroughs's ''Naked Lunch,'' Ginsberg was perhaps being ironic or naive in repeating the popular canard that the Nazi party was a party of ''sex perverts.''</p>
        <p>Within weeks of Hitler's ascension to Chancellor in 1933, homosexual rights organizations were banned. The Reich's antigay program included restricting gay social life and then increasing penalties for same-sex activities until the death penalty was prescribed in 1941 for any German engaging in sexual activity with another man.</p>
        <p>It is true that there were homosexuals who came to the party. As Richard Plant documents in ''The Pink Triangle: The Nazi War Against Homosexuals,'' Ernst Rohm, who had been a professional soldier and openly gay, organized the S.A., Hitler's storm troopers, numbers of whom were murdered during the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 to prevent Rohm's merging the brown-shirt S.A. with the regular army. According to Mr. Plant, this was ''the end of anybody of any influence who was gay in the Nazi movement.''</p>
        <p>Although the dragnet of homosexuals for slave labor and extermination in the camps never reached the level of that for Jews, the historical record gives the lie to Ginsberg's assertion.</p>
