        <p>More than 2,000 Rwandan civilians were killed in May and June because of ''excessive force'' used during Army search operations in the northwest, the United Nations human rights center said today.</p>
        <p>The ''greatly increased number of violent incidents'' in Ruhengeri, a province bordering Congo, the former Zaire, led to the deaths of at least 2,022 people, the United Nations said. This was the largest number of deaths recorded in the province since the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights began sending monitors to Rwanda three years ago after the massacre of an estimated 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu.</p>

        <p>The human rights report said a ''significant number of the elderly, women and children'' have been killed. In one village, the report said, 1,226 people were killed by Army troops over four days in May after an attack on an Army convoy. According to the center, soldiers searched houses and shot or stabbed people suspected of aiding rebels.</p>
        <p>The human rights center said the report was based on ''credible firsthand information from a variety of unrelated sources.''</p>
