        <p>To get to a performance of ''Arsenic and Old Lace'' the other day, drivers had to spin past farmers harvesting wheat and turn left at a field of corn so high, thick and dark a shade of green that it could pass for a tree nursery.</p>
        <p>The comedy started at the odd time of 3 P.M., just right for the crowd of retired farmers, tourists and townspeople who were able to witness the last body being buried in the basement and return to their homes or hotels well before nightfall.</p>
        <p>The play was performed in a 278-seat theater by the Old Creamery Theater Company, which, in the view of its directors, would suffer a powerful setback if the National Endowment for the Arts was abolished. The end of Federal support for the arts, they say, would hurt small-town groups more than those in big cities like New York and Los Angeles, which attract bigger grants but also have greater resources than their country cousins.</p>
        <p>''The big money has gone to the coasts,'' said Thomas P. Johnson, producing director of the theater. ''That's understandable, because dance and theater and concerts are there, but it hurts the middle of the country.''</p>
        <p>The people in this sparsely populated area in northeastern Iowa are noted for their independence, and even those in the arts disagree over what would happen if the endowment had its money cut off. The House of Representatives has voted to do just that, while the Senate is expected to vote to keep spending at $99 million a year. A resolution would have to be worked out in a conference committee.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hunter Fuerste, an ophthalmologist and jazz trombonist in Dubuque, Iowa, where he is a supporter of the arts, said, ''We would probably do just as well going to the private sector.'' He said Federal support for the arts went beyond the constitutional purposes of government, adding, ''I think it's good that any group tries to support the arts, but whenever the government gets involved, it wastes money.''</p>
        <p>But a friend of Dr. Fuerste, Wayne Norman, who is one of Dubuque's leading arts patrons, disagreed. ''The main purpose for the N.E.A. is to be a catalyst,'' he said. ''The Old Creamery Theater would not exist except for grants from the Iowa Arts Council, which got money from the N.E.A.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Norman, a retired corporate executive and former chairman of the Iowa Arts Council, said, ''What the Federal funds did was to break free the state funds, and the Federal and state funds encourage private donations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Norman is such an independent Iowan that he shifted his political alignment during lunch at the country club. ''I'm a conservative Republican,'' he said when it was argued that his Congressman, Jim Nussle, probably represented the prevailing view in this conservative Republican area in his opposition to the endowment. Then Mr. Norman rethought things and said, ''I'm a liberal Republican, if there is such a thing.''</p>
        <p>Representative Nussle declined to be interviewed on his opposition to the endowment. His spokesman, Steve Weber, said Mr. Nussle was an advocate of the arts but was against a Federal role. ''He thinks those decisions should be made at a local level,'' Mr. Weber said.</p>
        <p>Iowa's two Senators, Charles E. Grassley, a Republican, and Tom Harkin, a Democrat, favor keeping the endowment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norman's wife, Edie, a member of the Dubuque Arts Council, said  her organization got ''at most $10,000 a year'' from the endowment. ''If there were no N.E.A.,'' she said, ''we would not have as much outreach. We'd survive because Americans survive. But we wouldn't have the up-and-coming artists.''</p>
        <p>The choreographer Bill T. Jones was an up-and-coming dancer when he came to Iowa in 1980 to participate in an eight-week program sponsored by the Cedar Arts Forum that was partly financed by the endowment. ''I was available to any groups that requested me: doctors, Kiwanis Clubs, a black church, the Grange Hall,'' Mr. Jones said from Durham, N.C., where he was participating in the American Dance Festival.</p>
        <p>''There was a consciousness raised about what modern dance was,'' he said. ''If people couldn't come to Manhattan, Manhattan would come to them.''</p>
        <p>Renata Sack, the director of the Cedar Arts Forum, said when asked what would happen if the endowment was ended: ''The children would not get exposure to the arts. In many small communities, there is little money for the arts: no corporations, no foundations.''</p>
        <p>Of the position of Mr. Nussle and others that the private sector would fill the void left by the endowment, Ms. Sack said: ''That's impossible. People with rich resources would have everything, and the people in small towns would get nothing. We are far from the trodden path.''</p>
        <p>Back here, where the addled sisters of ''Arsenic'' were dispatching their callers, the concern was that the end of the endowment would result in a more mundane repertory for the Old Creamery Theater and in sharp cuts in the shows it sends to Iowa's small towns.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Althof, the director of development, said that the theater usually presented a season of 32 performances each of six or seven plays, from old standbys like ''Arsenic,'' which draw big audiences and pay for themselves, to such adventuresome modern ones as ''Dancing at Lughnasa,'' which lose money at the box office and need subsidies.</p>
        <p>Why not book the popular shows all the time and not have to depend on subsidies? she was asked.</p>
        <p>''If we did 'Fiddler on the Roof' and 'A Chorus Line' all the time,'' Ms. Althof said, ''we'd be fine. We wouldn't be able to do challenging art, like 'Dancing at Lughnasa,' without endowment support. Are we willing to sit back and see American culture stagnate and do the old standbys over and over again? 'Arsenic and Old Lace' was new once. Now it's an established classic.''</p>
        <p>The actors play lots of roles away from the Old Creamery stage. They participate with local artisans in ''An Afternoon in the Old Colony,'' playing for tourists the roles of the German religious dissenters who settled in the Amana area and explaining 19th-century life here.</p>
        <p>But, Ms. Althof said, ''The biggest thing the N.E.A. does for us is support our school program.'' Each year, the company visits about 125 schools, although it has had to reduce its schedule.</p>
        <p>The plays are written by the company, ''generally, native American stories, stories dealing with self-esteem, nonviolent conflict resolution,'' Ms. Althof said. ''We visit very, very small towns, mostly rural. We try to reach the isolated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, her colleague, said this was among the company's most important functions. ''Geographic isolation is the greatest threat to the arts in the United States,'' he said, suggesting that the end of the endowment would add to that isolation.</p>
