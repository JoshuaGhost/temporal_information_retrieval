        <p>Stephan-Gotz Richter (Op-Ed, Aug. 18) suggests that ''unnamed officials'' and ''leaks'' signaled in late July that the United States was changing its Iran policy, starting with its failure to oppose a gas pipeline through Iran. But that policy was announced on July 23 by Alan Larsen, the Assistant Secretary of State, to the House International Relations Committee. Mr. Richter claims this policy ''shift'' shows the influence of American oil companies, yet it's the only major gas or oil project in the region in which no American company is involved.</p>

        <p>Mr. Richter thinks that Iran was the key concern in this decision, but American officials have repeatedly said that it was made primarily to assist Turkey. Mr. Richter also ignores the order issued by President Clinton on Aug. 19 deepening sanctions on Iran.</p>
