        <p>WHEN we were young, my siblings and I played a game in which one of us secretly selected an object in the room, and the others would try to guess what it was.

        <p>That game came to mind as I test-drove the 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue along with its principal target, the Toyota Camry. The Intrigue is the latest of several new midsize cars from the General Motors Corporation, and shares its basic front-wheel-drive architecture with the Buick Regal, Buick Century and Pontiac Grand Prix.</p>

        <p>WHEN we were young, my siblings and I played a game in which one of us secretly selected an object in the room, and the others would try to guess what it was. The person keeping the secret would suggest how close we were to the article by telling us we were getting warmer -- that is, closer -- or colder, which was farther away.</p>
        <p>That game came to mind as I test-drove the 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue along with its principal target, the Toyota Camry. The Intrigue is the latest of several new midsize cars from the General Motors Corporation, and shares its basic front-wheel-drive architecture with the Buick Regal, Buick Century and Pontiac Grand Prix.</p>
        <p>But the Intrigue looks and feels more like a Japanese or European import than its corporate cousins. With their decidedly American flavor, they face off against cars like the Ford Taurus and Dodge Intrepid.</p>
        <p>In taking aim at the Camry, which is likely to become the best-selling car in the United States this year, Olds is setting its sights high: Even Toyota's competitors grudgingly acknowledge that the Camry has set the standard for midsize family sedans.</p>
        <p>After a week-long direct comparison of the top-of-the-line Intrigue GL and Camry XLE, I concluded that Oldsmobile is getting warmer: it is close to hitting its Toyota target. Indeed, in some respects -- styling, content and price, among them -- it is downright hot. But some challenges remain for America's oldest auto nameplate.</p>
        <p>The '98 Intrigue, which went on sale last month, replaces the Cutlass Supreme, though the most recent version of that car was far less popular than some Cutlasses of the past. Indeed, in the mid-70's, the medium-sized Oldsmobile was America's best-seller, with half a million sales in some years. Last year, Oldsmobile sold only 331,287 cars for its entire product line.</p>
        <p>(A new Cutlass, sans Supreme, also made its debut this year. A virtual twin of the Chevrolet Malibu, it is slightly smaller and less expensive than the Intrigue.)</p>
        <p>Oldsmobile has made it to its 100th birthday after a brush with extinction a few years ago, when there was speculation in Detroit that G.M. would shut down the ailing division. And Olds has a new mission: to woo young, affluent import buyers.</p>
        <p>The Intrigue bears a striking resemblance to the larger, more expensive Olds Aurora. While it shares the Aurora's styling cues, including a sloping hood, bulging fenders and taut skin over a muscular-looking body, its features are more subdued. Still, in my view, the Intrigue is more stylish than the generic-looking Camry.</p>
        <p>There is minimal chrome and few badges, in the style of many imports. The new Olds logo, a circle broken by a diagonal line symbolizing a rocket, is on the nose. The Oldsmobile name appears only on a taillight and on the radio. A commanding seating position and low instrument panel provide good visibility, and are also reminiscent of imports like the Camry and Honda Accord, another target of the Intrigue.</p>
        <p>While 7 to 10 inches longer than the Camry and the current Accord, and about 500 pounds heavier, the Intrigue also feels bigger on the inside. There is ample room for four adults; five will fit, but snugly.</p>
        <p>In keeping with its exterior, the interior is refined and elegant. The test model was outfitted in warm tones of beige and taupe leather. The controls and amenities were presented in the logical Japanese fashion.</p>
        <p>Olds has taken a simple approach to the Intrigue. It comes in just two trim levels, base and GL. There is just one power train -- a V6 engine with a four-speed, electronically controlled automatic transmission. There is a long list of standard features and only a few options. The base Intrigue starts at $21,250 and the GL is $22,650, compared with $24,508 for the top-of-the-line Camry XLE. And the Olds comes with more equipment, including traction control.</p>
        <p>All Intrigues have power windows, mirrors and locks; air-conditioning; anti-lock brakes and AM/FM/cassette. The GL has automatic dual climate controls (not available on the Camry), a Delco-Bose stereo with cassette and compact disk players, and fog lamps. GL options include leather trim and an ''Autobahn package'' with larger front brakes and upgraded tires.</p>
        <p>The Intrigue also offers audio controls on the steering wheel, a feature I generally like. But these are awkwardly positioned, so I used the dash controls instead.</p>
        <p>The one item Camry has that my two children and I missed on the Intrigue was a shoulder-lap belt for the rear center passenger. The Intrigue has only a lap belt.</p>
        <p>Storage is plentiful. A front console holds CD's as well as a couple pairs of sunglasses; the glove box is respectable, and the doors have map pockets. At 16 cubic feet, the trunk is large and easily accessible.</p>
        <p>But the trunk is one place where the differences between Intrigue and Camry -- between Olds and Toyota -- are apparent. Ill-fitting carpet lined the Intrigue's cargo area. Tape-covered cables drooped from the top, paper tags dangling from them. A delicate cable for the fuel door release was exposed. In the Camry's trunk, the carpet fit snugly and no cables could be seen.</p>
        <p>The trunks have no bearing on the performance of either vehicle, of course. But they suggest that Toyota pays more attention to details, even those the customer rarely sees. Ergo, one may conclude, it has also paid attention to the details that do matter.</p>
        <p>In general, though, the Intrigue shows a high level of quality and the kind of attention to detail that G.M.'s cars have often lacked.</p>
        <p>At the wheel, the Intrigue and Camry are different in subtle ways. Both cars successfully balance a comfortable ride with responsive handling. The Intrigue, which does not feel especially large despite its greater length, proved particularly composed over harsh bumps. Its steering was surprisingly precise. Point the Intrigue and it stays on course, even over rough surfaces.</p>
        <p>The Intrigue is powered by a workhorse G.M. engine, the 3800 Series II V6, which delivers 195 horsepower and moves the car smartly away from stoplights. But the engine is an old-style design in which the valves are moved by pushrods. The 3-liter Toyota V6 that powers the Camry is a more modern dual-overhead-cam engine.</p>
        <p>The Intrigue was to have received G.M.'s 3.4-liter dual-overhead-cam V6, but consumers complained in marketing clinics that the engine was too noisy. Instead, the car will get a 3.5-liter V6 later this year, the first of a new G.M. family of dual-cam engines that draw on the technology of Cadillac's acclaimed Northstar V8.</p>
        <p>Performance-oriented drivers may be disappointed that the Intrigue comes only with an automatic transmission. A five-speed manual is available on the Camry.</p>
        <p>While the Intrigue excels in content and price and matches the Camry in its handling and ride, the Toyota has its own set of attractions. The Camry's reliability record is nearly impeccable, and its resale value is among the industry's highest. While the workmanship and performance of the Intrigue test car seemed roughly on par with the Camry, the Olds's quality and reliability record is unproved (and all-new G.M. products have often disappointed in the past).</p>
        <p>In addition, Toyota's showrooms are already destinations for the young, affluent car shoppers who have skirted Olds dealers. Oldsmobile's biggest challenge is to lure those customers, now that it again has a midsize car worthy of their consideration.</p>
