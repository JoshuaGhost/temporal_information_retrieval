There is the assassination attempt during his 1972 campaign for President, which left him paralyzed below the waist.

        <p>George Wallace's career is among the most dramatic in American politics, and it is crammed with defining moments. All are recreated with startling veracity and tension in the two-part mini-series called simply ''George Wallace.''</p>
        <p>There is his chilling first inaugural speech as Alabama's Governor, in 1963, when he  declared, ''Segregation today, segregation tomorrow and segregation forever.'' There is the permanent image of Governor Wallace standing in the doorway of the University of Alabama to prevent two black students from registering. There is the assassination attempt during his 1972 campaign for President, which left him paralyzed below the waist. And finally, in the late 70's, come his public apologies for his segregationst past, notably in a black church where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached.</p>
        <p>But the most telling moment does not take place on the historical stage. Instead, it comes in one of the film's inspired and completely justified inventions. The night he has been defeated in his first run for Governor, in 1958, he looks disheveled and distraught with disbelief. He has lost to a more vehement segregationist; his wife, Lurleen, fed up with his lack of attention, is threatening to leave him. In a quiet hotel room he faces her and slowly says: ''Losing this vote today, it's like I just disappeared or something. Like I'm not worth nothin'. To nobody. Nothin'.''</p>
        <p>At that moment ''Wallace'' moves beyond documented facts and offers a glimpse into the hollow soul of a man who must be elected to feel alive, and through him into the hollow soul of politics itself. At that moment, near the end of Part 1, there is no further doubt that ''Wallace'' can stand among the classic political portraits on screen.</p>
        <p>Gary Sinise's amazing performance captures all the facets and changes in Mr. Wallace's character, from a mean-spirited opportunist to a chastened and shattered figure. The director and producer, John Frankenheimer, has created his greatest artistic success since ''The Manchurian Candidate''; in fact, ''Wallace'' serves as a companion piece, another frightening comment on the darkness of American politics.</p>
        <p>The script, by Marshall Frady and Paul Monash, is based on Mr. Frady's biography, which begins with an apt epigraph from Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men.'' This film is far closer in spirit to the Warren novel and its film version than to Oliver Stone's ''Nixon'' or ''J. F. K.,'' more obvious comparisons. ''Wallace'' compresses chronology and creates dialogue, as in that scene after the first lost election. Yet it remains close to the facts and always uses that freedom to create a deep and cogent character.</p>
        <p>The film begins on the morning of the assassination attempt, with the Governor and his glamorous second wife, Cornelia, dressing in the bedroom. It is poignant to see them rolling around for a minute on top of their bed; he will never be able to do this again. The film then flashes back to the start of his career, occasionally and gracefully leaping ahead to the 1970's.</p>
        <p>After his loss in that first Governor's race, when he had embraced segregation but rejected the Ku Klux Klan, Mr. Wallace becomes more vitriolic in his segregationist stance. Recent biographies view this as political convenience more than inbred racism, but the mini-series is complex enough to see that it is not an either/or choice. It suits the film's Wallace just fine that racist attitudes offer the surest route to political success. And he loses no sleep during the lowest point of his governorship, when the bombing of a black church in Birmingham causes the deaths of four little girls.</p>
        <p>The film occasionally turns to black-and-white to recreate the best- documented moments of the Wallace career, including his standoff at the university with the Deputy Attorney General, Nicholas deB. Katzenbach, and the National Guard. What sounds like a gimmick actually creates a sense that those scenes are, indelibly, part of history.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sinise, one of our smartest actors, gives a surpassingly intelligent performance here. The Wallace accent and look are evident but toned down. This is no act of mimicry but the creation of a whole personality. That character's attitudes are at times vile, but Mr. Sinise always makes him watchable and even pulls off the trick of making a fairly shallow man seem real. And though the film never justifies Mr. Wallace's politics, it is clear that he spoke to and for a significant part of the nation.</p>
        <p>Mare Winningham is extraordinary as Lurleen, essentially a timid, chain-smoking woman. Soon after an operation for cancer, the worn-out Lurleen ran for Governor because her husband could not succeed himself. Her deathbed scene in the Governor's mansion is a touching portrait of a loving woman badly used. The rest of the cast is also exceptional. Joe Don Baker is terrifically cast as Mr. Wallace's hard-drinking mentor, the former Governor Big Jim Folsom. Terry Kinney is steadfast as one of his oldest political advisers, and Angelina Jolie embodies a type, the flirtatious Southern woman, as Cornelia.</p>
        <p>Among the film's inventions is the character of Archie (Clarence Williams 3d) one of the black prisoners who traditionally work as servants to the Alabama Governor. In the background, constantly glaring as a silent witness, Archie is usually less effective than the occasional clips of Dr.  King and news film of riots. Yet there is a payoff when Archie, alone in the kitchen with the Governor, stands behind him with an ice pick and decides whether to kill him. The scene works as an expression of generations of rage and confusion about what action to take in the face of ingrained racism.</p>
        <p>That scene was one of two that the Wallace family vehemently objected to in the script, even threatening to sue. The film now includes a strong statement at the end that Archie is invented. The other scene, in which Mr. Wallace, despairing and wheelchair-bound, tries to commit suicide, has been eliminated.</p>
        <p>In the end, the film gives Mr. Wallace the benefit of the doubt about his political conversion, in a truly moving scene. After he apologizes in the church, saying, ''I have learned what suffering means,'' he is wheeled out while the congregation sings ''Amazing Grace'' (as they really did). Never have the words ''to save a wretch like me'' carried more meaning.</p>
        <p>Though the film ends there, other programs update and complement it. ''George C. Wallace: The Politics of Race,'' a substantial installment in A&amp;E's ''Biography'' series (Wednesday night at 8), includes historical film of those public moments and pays more attention to Mr. Wallace's impact on national politics.</p>
        <p>And Spike Lee's powerful documentary about the 1963 church bombing, ''Four Little Girls'' (to be shown on HBO in February) shows the him as he appears today. Mr. Wallace, who will be 78 on Monday, is so frail that the film uses subtitles to make him understood. He calls in an embarrassed-looking black aide and says, ''A black man is my best friend, right here.'' Is he reassuring himself, his audience or both? Mr. Lee's documentary and the mini-series ''George Wallace'' leave that question compellingly open.</p>
