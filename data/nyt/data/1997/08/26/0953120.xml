        <p>WATER is a necessity of life, and the thirst for clear, clean water is not drying up anytime soon, though municipal financing well might. Consequently, Wall Street analysts see a potential for growth in the private utility companies that are steadily absorbing a bigger share of the water market by taking on the management of public water systems.</p>
        <p>''It's really the buzz of the water utility sector over the last year,'' said Gregg Orrill, research analyst at HSBC Securities in Washington. That goes beyond the water industry's traditional attractions to many Wall Street analysts, its high dividends and stability.</p>
        <p>To be sure, in a $30 billion national water industry, the private utility vendors' share was just $4.2 billion last year. The largest of the publicly traded water companies is the American Water Works Company, which serves more than seven million people in 21 states. Next in line is United Water Resources Inc., which serves 2.5 million people in 13 states.</p>
        <p>Conservative investors who are looking for income will find that United Water, which closed yesterday at $17.25, has a yield of just under 5 percent, while American Water, which closed yesterday at $21.9375, offers a dividend of 3.5 percent. By contrast, the yield on the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is less than 1.7 percent.</p>
        <p>''Older investors who would look at bonds would also look at water,'' said Ronald Tanner, managing director of research at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore. ''It's stable because people have to use water.'' But some industry experts, thanks to recent regulatory changes, see more -- a  potential for growth.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin announced tax-rule changes that make it easier for local governments to enter into long-term contracts -- up to 20 years -- with private companies to manage operations that were financed with tax-exempt bonds.</p>
        <p>And the 1996 amendments to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act included a provision that allowed states to make grants of up to $75 million to local water systems -- both publicly and privately owned.</p>
        <p>Until lately, privatization has been slow, perhaps because providing safe, clean water is still considered a basic task of local government. But a 1997 United States Environmental Protection Agency survey estimated that at least $138.4 billion must be invested to bring the nation's water systems up to Federal water-quality standards.</p>
        <p>Cities are finding it difficult to take on such a financial burden, particularly if it entails raising water rates, a politically unpopular step. So, some officials, including Bret D. Schundler, Mayor of Jersey City, and Larry Guidi, Mayor of Hawthorne, Calif., have turned to the private sector.</p>
        <p>Privatization comes about in two ways. For decades, private companies -- notably, American Water -- have been buying the assets of existing water systems. But increasingly, private companies -- notably, United Water -- are simply contracting to take over management of municipally owned water systems. Both industry leaders, however, have at times used both methods.</p>
        <p>Donald L. Correll, president and chief executive of United Water, said: ''There are many municipalities that have well-run water systems that may not need the assistance of the private sector, that may have adequate access to capital, may have a good efficient work force. There is nothing that we in the private sector can offer them.'' But the partnership approach can be attractive for  many municipalities that have shortcomings, he added.</p>
        <p>With only a handful of contracts of $5 million or more offered to the private sector every year, competition is driving the private water companies to keep their management fees low. As a result, Mr. Orrill said, the profit margins on many of these contracts are slim. American Water, based in Voorhees, N.J., had an overall profit margin of 11.7 percent last year, however, while at United Water, based in Harrington Park, N.J., it was 12.3 percent. Both were quite robust compared with those of the broader utlity industry, analysts said.</p>
        <p>And water privatization has attracted interest from abroad. In 1994, Lyonnaise des Eaux, a French water utility and construction company, which is now known as Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, entered into a joint venture with United Water to focus on water management contracts. That joint venture, Lyonnaise American Holding, has a 26 percent stake in United Water.</p>
        <p>Despite some municipal misgivings about private management of water utilities, Mr. Orrill contends the trend is gathering strength. ''To ignore it is crazy because it's coming,'' he said. And with it, he added, may come even greater interest in water company stocks.</p>
