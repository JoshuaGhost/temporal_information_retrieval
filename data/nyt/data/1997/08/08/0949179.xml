        <p>While the best of this season's 3-year-old colts were preparing for their next test in the Travers Stakes here in two weeks, the premier senior horses on both the East and the West coasts were primed for two major stakes this weekend: the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar and the $250,000 Sword Dancer Invitational at Saratoga.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Classic, a mile and a quarter on dirt, drew a field of six horses led by the superstars Gentlemen and Siphon, considered by many the two best race horses in the world. They met in June in the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup, and Gentlemen won by four lengths. For the Classic, he was quoted at 6-5, despite his drawing the outside post position; Siphon was listed at 9-5, breaking from No. 3.</p>

        <p>While the best of this season's 3-year-old colts were preparing for their next test in the Travers Stakes here in two weeks, the premier senior horses on both the East and the West coasts were primed for two major stakes this weekend: the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar and the $250,000 Sword Dancer Invitational at Saratoga.</p>
        <p>The Pacific Classic, a mile and a quarter on dirt, drew a field of six horses led by the superstars Gentlemen and Siphon, considered by many the two best race horses in the world. They met in June in the $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup, and Gentlemen won by four lengths. For the Classic, he was quoted at 6-5, despite his drawing the outside post position; Siphon was listed at 9-5, breaking from No. 3.</p>
        <p>Gentlemen and Siphon are trained by Dick Mandella, who has entered as many as five horses in one race and who outnumbered and outran the great Cigar in last year's Pacific Classic with Siphon setting the pace and Dare and Go furnishing the coup de grace in the homestretch. He  gains Chris McCarron as Siphon's jockey in place of the injured David Flores.</p>
        <p>The Sword Dancer, a mile and a half on grass, drew a field of nine led by Influent, the Canadian-bred 6-year-old gelding who has won four of his five starts this year.</p>
        <p>In the start he did not win, the New Hampshire Sweepstakes on June 15, he finished second. His chief rival will be the 7-year-old Awad.</p>
        <p>Said Howie Tesher, who trains Influent: ''This is a horse that has gotten very good, and I think he knows how good he is, and I think he's the one to beat on Saturday.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>The trainer LEO O'BRIEN on Thursday won the Yaddo Handicap for the seventh time, and at extravagant odds in a mass photo finish, when his 4-year-old filly Junior Pitchunia caught the wire at 47-1 by a head over the favorite, Irish Daisy, also trained by O'Brien. The winner ran the mile and an eighth under JOE BRAVO in 1 minute 431/5  seconds and paid $97.50 for a $2 bet to win. . . . No horse brought $1 million at the second session of the Saratoga yearling sale, as on opening night. The top price paid was $475,000, twice: for a chestnut colt by Miswaki from a Deputy Minister mare, Love From the Air, and for a bay colt by Gone West from the Nijinsky II mare Love You by Heart. The second-night average declined by 2 percent from a year ago, to $151,604.</p>
