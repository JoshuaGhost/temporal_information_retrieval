        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In agreeing to discuss ''Primary Colors'' with Maureen Dowd (column, Aug. 27), I hoped to communicate the following: that while the book was clearly inspired by the 1992 Presidential campaign, it was also clearly a work of fiction. What I actually said to her was, ''In my mind, the characters took on lives of their own'' as they progressed through a series of scenes that were entirely my own invention. I learned quite a bit about politics from the Stantons and I enjoyed the experience immensely, imagining how they might react to a broad range of situations -- and recognizing, ultimately, that their strengths were every bit as compelling as their weaknesses.</p>

        <p>As far as I can tell, the film-makers have been faithful to both the text and the spirit of the book.</p>
