        <p>MOORE-Jerome R. At 65, on February 9th, in NYC after a demoralizing two-year battle with cancer. Served USAF 1951-54 as Russian-German language specialist in Berlin. Final two years, headed up top secret project there. Upon release, attended Columbia University; graduated magna cum laude, and elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Joined American Oil as press representative for three years; thence for fourteen years at Hill &amp; Knowlton, then world's largest P.R. firm. Elected youngest V.P. and, later Sr. V.P. in H &amp; K's history. Handled several major accounts (Texaco, OwensIllinois, Warner-Lambert, Marathon Oil, etc.). In 1974, to Arthur Young, a top public accounting company as a principal and P.R. director. Retired in 1987, but continued to serve as P.R. counsel to companies. We honor him for his longtime friendship and wise counsel; for his great love of the sea, sky and all of nature, for his lifetime commitment to opera and the theater, and for his great affection for Scotties, ''the best dogs there ever wuz''. We extend our heartfelt condolences to his three surviving brothers: Jack, Tom and Larry, and their families. May he rest in peace. With all our love.
