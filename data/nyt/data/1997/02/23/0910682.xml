        <p>An Original Man</p>
        <p>The Life and Times</p>
        <p>of Elijah Muhammad.</p>
        <p>By Claude Andrew Clegg 3d.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 377 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>St. Martin's Press. $25.95.</p>
        <p>I can think of no 20th-century leader with anything like the impact of Elijah Muhammad whose life has been so profoundly unexamined. Even as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, his closest disciples, have become part of the national debate and popular culture, Muhammad, the head of the Nation of Islam for nearly 50 years, has remained a shadowy figure, defined, if at all, by hearsay and propaganda. Yet this diminutive, frail, informally educated man built the Nation of Islam from a tiny fringe group into a multifaceted organization that became an important player in black America's spiritual, economic and political life. By the time of his death in 1975, Muhammad had in one way or another touched the lives of most black Americans and, less directly, most white ones, too. In ''An Original Man: The Life and Times of Elijah Muhammad,'' Claude Andrew Clegg 3d, a professor of history at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, has brought Muhammad to light in a fluidly written biography rich with information, analysis and suspense.</p>
        <p>Born Elijah Poole in Sandersville, Ga., in 1897, Muhammad was one of 13 children; his father was a sharecropper and Baptist preacher, his mother a domestic worker who ''claimed to have had a vision that one day she would give birth to a male child of pre-eminent stature and importance.'' The first decade of Muhammad's life gave no indication of the prominence to come. But at 10, while working as a laborer, he saw the lynched body of a young man he knew. ''The murder and the subdued reaction of the African-American community repulsed him,'' Mr. Clegg says. In 1923, married and with children, he moved himself and his family, including his parents and siblings, north to Detroit. Mr. Clegg draws a vivid picture of the personal and social pressures he encountered there -- from economic insecurity and pervasive racism to political disfranchisement. They eventually led the unemployed Muhammad to despair and liquor.</p>
        <p>It was in Detroit in 1931 that he met W. D. Fard, a short, white-skinned man who identified himself as God and offered Elijah Poole a new name, a religion customized for black Americans and the seeds of what would become the Nation of Islam. Muhammad, Mr. Clegg writes, ''was mesmerized by the ideas of the Muslim leader regarding the originality and superiority of blackness, moral living, proper dieting and the new world to come.'' In a seamless interweaving of history and biography, Mr. Clegg sets Muhammad's almost immediate conversion to Islam in the context of national politics, his own personal history and existing black political and religious organizations, including Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association.</p>
        <p>The building of the Nation of Islam was a long process, one rife in the early years with internal dissension and persecution by local police, the F.B.I. and the Federal Government, which convicted Muhammad of draft evasion in 1942. Four years in prison ''did more toward consolidating his authority over the Nation of Islam than a decade of bickering, purges and wandering could ever have done,'' Mr. Clegg writes. Settled in Chicago after his release in 1946, Muhammad demonstrated a brilliant ability to turn adversity into advantage. He won new converts by capitalizing on government repression, and made his study of prison farms and businesses the foundation for the Nation of Islam's economic empire in the 1950's. Mr. Clegg provides a critique of the Nation of Islam's theology, which celebrates blacks as the ''original people'' and condemns whites as ''devils,'' but he also observes that what attracted thousands to the Nation of Islam was Muhammad's personality, his warmth, persuasiveness and paternalism.</p>
        <p>By the 1960's, membership was estimated at anywhere from 5,000 to 250,000. Whatever the numbers, the Nation of Islam's influence was enormous. It operated dozens of temples, owned property worth millions of dollars, ran numerous businesses and published a national newspaper. Muhammad's call to black Americans to ''Do Something for Self'' and to disdain integration put the Nation of Islam in militant opposition to most civil rights organizations of the era and made its leader a powerful voice in local and national politics. It is a voice that, more than 20 years after Muhammad's death, is still heard, most notably at the 1995 Million Man March in Washington. ''An Original Man'' begins the work of telling us why.</p>
