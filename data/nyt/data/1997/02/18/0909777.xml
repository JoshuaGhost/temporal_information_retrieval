        <p>The campaign that ultimately toppled Adelphi University's board of trustees was born here two years ago in the campus cafeteria.</p>
        <p>Over daily lunches of salads, sandwiches, soda and coffee, three faculty union leaders confided the latest rumors of administration chicanery and their fears for the school's survival under the university's president, Peter Diamandopoulos.</p>
        <p>They decided to do something about it. But their original plan, they said, was to help the trustees.</p>
        <p>''Never in a million years did we dream it would come to this,'' said the union's executive director, Catherine Cleaver. ''We were going to go to the board with the problems and work them out together. We believed they didn't have all the information, and once we got it to them, they would act.''</p>
        <p>In the early months, secrecy shrouded their activities. A steering committee of eight held its first session Saturday morning, April 8, 1995, in an English department conference room. They called themselves the C.I.A. -- the Committee to Investigate Adelphi.</p>
        <p>As the underground network spread, assignments were divvied up. Volunteers poked through records, researched legal cases and discreetly approached current and former administrators for tips. Soon, evidence was found that proved pivotal.</p>
        <p>Dr. Devin G. Thornburg, a soft-spoken psychology professor turned amateur detective, recalled one of his ''eureka moments.'' His neighbor's home computer pulled up the real estate listing of the $1.1 million Manhattan condominium that Adelphi had bought for Dr. Diamandopoulos's use, augmenting the house provided on campus.</p>
        <p>''That I will never forget,'' Dr. Thornburg said. ''But I thought the numbers were wrong, frankly, that there had been some kind of mistake. It boggled my mind.'' Later discoveries were that Dr. Diamandopoulos had spent $200,000 more to renovate and furnish the new condominium, and that the trustees had granted him the right to buy it at $400,000 below cost.</p>
        <p>The campaign went public with a thick dossier in September 1995 that was provided to Newsday and The New York Times. The group, renamed from the C.I.A. to the Committee to Save Adelphi and with the faculty still its core, broadened into a coalition encompassing former trustees, former administrators, alumni, students and parents. Turning to professionals, the coalition hired a publicist, two investigators and two lawyers.</p>
        <p>Their bills reached $700,000, mostly for legal costs in 27 days of hearings by the State Board of Regents. That proceeding culminated last week in the removal of 18 of 19 trustees for misconduct and neglect. The trustees immediately contested their ouster in court, but on Thursday they resigned. That cleared the way for a new board appointed by the Regents, which will convene this week.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cleaver said the committee hopes the new board will dismiss Dr. Diamandopoulos and then seek ways to increase enrollment, reach out to students and faculty members and figure out what kind of university Adelphi should be.</p>
        <p>So far, the coalition has raised $400,000, most from the 200-member faculty and the rest from 1,000 other donors. A benefit is planned to celebrate victory and retire the debt. The coalition estimates the trustees spent millions to defend themselves;  Adelphi has not disclosed those expenditures.</p>
        <p>Dr. Diamandopoulos and the trustees had denounced the coalition as a union front whose aim was to thwart administration attempts to revamp the curriculum and upgrade academic standards. They noted that the coalition and union used the same lawyers, Amy Gladstein and Beth Margolis.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the ousted trustees, referring to the coalition, said in a statement, ''For the past year and a half, Adelphi has been subjected to a well-financed 'corporate campaign' by a small group of dissidents, mainly the directorate of the faculty union, who have long been seeking to gain control of campus policy.'' They went on to criticize the ''negative publicity based on lies, distortions and disinformation'' that led to the Regents' investigation.</p>
        <p>The coalition concedes that the union leadership played a major role in its efforts but said that its base is broader than the union and that the union provided no money to the committee, and committee leaders disavowed any union agenda. For example, one coalition leader, Dr. Dominick J. Cavallo, was a dean under Dr. Diamandopoulos and a union adversary as a contract negotiator for Adelphi management. He said he resigned as dean in 1990 because ''I thought I was on the Titanic, honestly.''</p>
        <p>Another coalition leader, Leonard Nadel, is a former Adelphi board chairman who led the search committee that recruited Dr. Diamandopoulos but became disillusioned. Mr. Nadel, who regularly confronts unions as a hospital executive, said, ''I wouldn't be behind this if I thought for a minute it was a union issue rather than a case of misconduct and mismanagement.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cleaver was in the original trio of cafeteria strategists, with Rakesh Gupta, a business professor and union representative, and Dr. Gayle Insler, a biology professor and president of the union, Adelphi's chapter of the American Association of University Professors.</p>
        <p>Their lunchtime chitchat had grown grim, they said, as they talked about campus turmoil and the drop in enrollment, rising tuition and academic cutbacks.</p>
        <p>A few months later, the campaign's efforts were jolted by a Chronicle of Higher Education survey ranking Dr. Diamandopoulos's pay and benefits of $523,000 as the second highest among the nation's university presidents. First place went to his mentor -- and fellow Adelphi trustee -- Dr. John Silber of Boston University.</p>
        <p>Soon after the coalition held its first news conference.</p>
        <p>But the disclosures did not appear to upset Adelphi's trustees. They rallied around Dr. Diamandopoulos and rebuffed the calls for a board investigation. At the same time, the committee began to question the trustees' role.</p>
        <p>''We were being stonewalled, and it became clear it was because of their own involvement,'' Dr. Thornburg said. He concluded that the campaign had to take on the entire board. ''It was a real turning point for me,'' he said. The coalition drafted a detailed petition to the Regents, then presented evidence at the Regents' hearing in the summer and fall.</p>
        <p>The campaign had many discouraging moments: investigative dead ends, a defamation suit from the trustees and a temporary stay against the trustees' ouster. ''I was quietly depressed'' by the stay, Dr. Thornburg said. ''Even Cathy was devastated, but in 10 minutes she was up and ready to go.''</p>
        <p>Despite its success, the campaign has exacted a toll.</p>
        <p>''It's been a major drain on my marriage,'' Dr. Thornburg said. ''I lost a good deal of time with my kids.''</p>
        <p>Yet, with the campaign ended now, he senses a void. ''I don't know what we will do when this is all over -- it has been our life for so long now,'' he said.</p>
