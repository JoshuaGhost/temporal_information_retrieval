        <p>The appeal of old-fashioned dishes continues. A recipe for chicken Normandy that ran last month prompted considerable response. This recipe for sauteed turkey seasoned with mustard, lemon and capers should be just as popular. The recipe contains none of those ingredients found in fusion cooking: no lemon grass, no tamarind paste, no Sichuan pepper.</p>
        <p>The rice dish, with roasted red peppers, onions and brussels sprouts, is old-fashioned, too, and has already charmed some who ordinarily turn up their noses at sprouts.</p>
        <p>Sauteed Turkey With Lemon and Capers</p>
        <p>3/4 pound boneless, skinless turkey breasts</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons flour</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon butter</p>
        <p>1 1/2 teaspoons canola oil</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons dry white wine</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons Dijon mustard</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons nonfat plain yogurt</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons light sour cream</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon capers</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>Freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Wash and dry the turkey, and cut it into strips  1/4-inch thick. Roll the strips in the flour.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the butter and oil in a large nonstick pan until it is very hot. Saute the turkey quickly on both sides until browned.</p>
        <p>3. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the wine, mustard, yogurt, sour cream, lemon juice and capers.  Stir to blend, cooking the turkey strips for about two minutes longer. Season with salt and pepper before  serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 servings.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 230 calories, 10 grams fat, 70 milligrams cholesterol, 390 milligrams sodium, 20 grams protein, 7 grams carbohydrate.</p>
        <p>Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Red Peppers and Rice</p>
        <p>3/4 cup long-grain rice</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups no-salt-added chicken or veal stock or broth</p>
        <p>8 ounces whole onion or 7 ounces chopped, ready-cut onion (1 2/3  cups)</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon olive oil</p>
        <p>10 ounces brussels sprouts</p>
        <p>2 large whole roasted red peppers</p>
        <p>1/8 to  1/4 teaspoon hot red-pepper flakes</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon salt.</p>
        <p>1. Combine the rice and stock in a heavy-bottomed pot and bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; cover and cook rice a total of 17 minutes, until liquid has been absorbed and rice is tender.</p>
        <p>2. Chop the whole onion. Heat a nonstick pan large enough to hold the remaining ingredients until it is very hot. Reduce heat to medium-high and add oil. Saute the onion until it begins to soften and brown.</p>
        <p>3. Wash, trim and quarter brussels sprouts; add to the onion; reduce heat to low, then cover and cook for about 5 minutes, until the sprouts are tender but still firm and green.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, rinse and julienne the red peppers. Stir into the vegetable mixture along with the hot red-pepper flakes.</p>
        <p>5. When rice is cooked, stir into vegetables and season with salt.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 servings.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 310 calories, 3 grams fat, 0 milligrams cholesterol, 150 milligrams sodium, 11 grams protein, 60 grams carbohydrate.</p>
        <p>Game Plan  Prepare the rice dish through Step 2.  Prepare the turkey dish through Step 1.  Continue rice dish through Step 3.  Finish turkey dish.  Finish rice dish.</p>
