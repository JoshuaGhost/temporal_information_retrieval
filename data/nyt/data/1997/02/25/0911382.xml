        <p>Magic 93, Pistons 84</p>
        <p>Anfernee Hardaway scored 29 points and the host Orlando Magic remained unbeaten under their interim coach, Richie Adubato, ending the Detroit Pistons' six-game winning streak with a 93-84 victory last night.</p>
        <p>The Magic improved to 4-0 since Adubato replaced Brian Hill, who was fired last week.</p>
        <p>Hardaway atoned for a poor performance in a road loss at Detroit on Feb. 12 by shooting 11 for 16 from the field, including 4 of 6 from behind the 3-point arc. Rony Seikaly was the only other player in double figures for Orlando, finishing with 19 points and 8 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Theo Ratliff led Detroit with 17 points. Grant Hill, who had a triple-double the last time the teams played, struggled with 14 points this time.</p>
        <p>Hardaway, just 3 of 15 from the field in Orlando's loss to the Pistons earlier in the month, had 18 points and the Magic shot 57 percent in building a 56-39 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>The Magic have limited opponents to 86 points per game under Adubato.</p>
        <p>Bulls 116, Trail Blazers 89</p>
        <p>Michael Jordan scored 30 of his 37 points in the first half as Chicago extended its winning streak to seven games.</p>
        <p>Scottie Pippen added 22 points, 11 assists and 9 rebounds for the Bulls, who are 49-6 over all and 26-1 at the United Center. They have won 19 consecutive home games.</p>
        <p>The last time the teams met, Feb. 4 in Portland, Jordan scored 22 fourth-quarter points as the Bulls rallied for an 88-84 victory. This time, Jordan took care of things early.</p>
        <p>After the reserves Steve Kerr, Toni Kukoc and Jason Caffey helped Chicago take a 53-39 lead, Jordan scored the Bulls' final 14 points of the first half to make it 67-49.</p>
        <p>He made three fade-away jumpers, a bank shot, a 3-pointer, a layup and a free throw during his spree. He scored over Marcus Brown, Stacey Augmon, Cliff Robinson and Rumeal Robinson.</p>
        <p>Hawks 106, Warriors 100</p>
        <p>Christian Laettner scored 25 points and Mookie Blaylock just missed a triple-double for Atlanta. Blaylock finished with 18 points, 9 rebounds and 8 assists as the Hawks won for the 23d time in 25 home games.</p>
        <p>Laettner hit a jumper to give the Hawks a 98-96 lead with 2 minutes 30 seconds left. Then Blaylock took over, scoring 4 points and making 2 steals for the Hawks down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Hornets 96, Spurs 84</p>
        <p>Glen Rice scored 33 points as the visiting Hornets extended their winning streak to a season-best five games. Charlotte has won 10 of its last 12 games.</p>
        <p>Anthony Mason added 24 points and 16 rebounds for Charlotte.</p>
