        <p>Frederick J. Almgren Jr., a mathematics professor at Princeton University who studied the geometry of surfaces, died on Wednesday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. He was 63 and lived in Princeton, N.J.</p>
        <p>The cause was a complication from a bone marrow transplant for the marrow disorder myelodysplasia, the university said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Almgren was an early and influential figure in geometric measure theory, which is concerned with such questions as the least amount of surface area obtainable for a particular shape.</p>
        <p>He worked, for example, on analyzing the structure of soap-bubble clusters and the growth of snowflakes.</p>
        <p>He was born in Birmingham, Ala., on July 3, 1933, and received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Princeton and a Ph. D. in mathematics from Brown University. He joined the Princeton faculty in 1962 and became a professor in 1972. At his death, he was the Henry Burchard Fine Professor of mathematics.</p>
        <p>Dr. Almgren was a founder of the National Science and Technology Research Center for Computation and Visualization of Geometric Structures in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>His first marriage, to Beverly S. Almgren, ended in divorce.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Jean Taylor; two daughters, Ann S., of Pleasanton, Calif., and Karen T., of Princeton; a son, Robert F., of Chicago; his mother, Sarah W., of Princeton; a brother, David, of Concord, Mass., and a sister, Linda Kime, of Cambridge, Mass.</p>
