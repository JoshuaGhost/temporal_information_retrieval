        <p>Blood-stained, 36-star American flag on which Abraham Lincoln's head supposedly rested after John Wilkes Booth shot him is on display at Pike County Historical Society in Milford, Pa; Joseph Garrera, a Lincoln expert from Fredon, NJ, says flag was donated to the society by a man whose mother and father were in the cast at Ford's Theater in Washington, DC, the night Lincoln was shot; photo (M)</p>

        <p>For decades, the tiny museum in Milford, Pa., was a wannabe. Its prize item -- a bloodstained, 36-star American flag on which Abraham Lincoln's head supposedly rested after John Wilkes Booth shot him -- was given little credibility, sometimes even at the museum, where it once hung from a shower-curtain rod. But as the nation celebrates the 188th anniversary of Lincoln's birthday this week, Milford is feeling justifiably cocky. Thanks to Barbara Buchanan, president of the Pike County Historical Society (pictured right), and Joseph Garrera, an Lincoln expert from Fredon, N.J. (left), the flag (now enclosed in an air-tight, 25-foot-tall case) has recently become an acknowledged star.</p>
        <p>''Most likely,'' says Michael Maione, the historian at Ford's Theater in Washington, ''it was one of the flags in the theater that night.''</p>

        <p>For decades, the tiny museum in Milford, Pa., was a wannabe. Its prize item -- a bloodstained, 36-star American flag on which Abraham Lincoln's head supposedly rested after John Wilkes Booth shot him -- was given little credibility, sometimes even at the museum, where it once hung from a shower-curtain rod. But as the nation celebrates the 188th anniversary of Lincoln's birthday this week, Milford is feeling justifiably cocky. Thanks to Barbara Buchanan, president of the Pike County Historical Society (pictured right), and Joseph Garrera, an Lincoln expert from Fredon, N.J. (left), the flag (now enclosed in an air-tight, 25-foot-tall case) has recently become an acknowledged star.</p>
        <p>''Most likely,'' says Michael Maione, the historian at Ford's Theater in Washington, ''it was one of the flags in the theater that night.''</p>
        <p>The turnaround occurred after Buchanan convinced Garrera, who was initially skeptical, to spend a year investigating the flag's authenticity. The flag, he learned, was donated to the society by a man whose mother and grandfather were in the cast of the Ford's Theater production of ''Our American Cousin''; the four American flags displayed that night subsequently disappeared. This flag's materials were from the period; the bloodstains are human.</p>
        <p>It still might emerge that the blood came from Maj. Henry Rathbone, who was wounded in the attack on Lincoln. Garrera believes that's very unlikely, in part because the stains indicated contact with a wound, rather than ''splatter.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, many people need no further convincing: museum attendance has tripled. Buchanan says anyone hoping to see it will have to come to Milford (call first!), because it won't be lent. ''The flag,'' she says, ''will never leave the building.''</p>
