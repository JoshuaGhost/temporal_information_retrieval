        <p>NOT all vegetables are at their best steamed and served al dente. Bitter greens like kale actually benefit from longer cooking, which makes them sweet and tender.</p>
        <p>Kale becomes as velvety as spinach with a rich earthy flavor. And now that recent frosts in Florida have sent the price of many other vegetables skyrocketing, it is a good time to consider kale, which is not only inexpensive but also at its best in cold weather.</p>
        <p>Kale is one of the prettiest of the Brassica oleracea (the family that includes cabbage, broccoli and brussels sprouts) and is high in vitamin A and C and folic acid.</p>
        <p>Although it is in season year round, it is most abundant in late fall and early winter. Kale has bright curly leaves that vary in color from blue-green to chartreuse and reddish purple, but the most common market variety is dark green with frilly leaves.</p>
        <p>Young kale leaves can be sauteed in olive oil with garlic and flavored with lemon, or stir-fried with slivers of ham, pork or chicken, Chinese-style. Older leaves lose their bitterness when simmered with cream and sprinkled with chopped crisp bacon or blanched and baked under a layer of Parmesan cheese. Kale is also good sauteed with potatoes, hot pepper and anchovies, which goes particularly well with roast lamb, ham or pork, or added to soup with beans or potatoes. The following dish can be eaten as a vegetable or tossed with noodles for a main course.</p>
        <p>Braised Kale With Cream and Bacon  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>4strips bacon</p>
        <p>2tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>1medium onion, diced</p>
        <p>2cloves garlic, minced</p>
        <p>2bunches kale</p>
        <p>1cup water</p>
        <p>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>3/4to 1 cup heavy cream.</p>
        <p>1. Dice the bacon and saute the pieces in a frying pan until crisp. Drain on paper towels. Pour off the bacon fat from the pan and add the olive oil. Add the onion and garlic and cook at medium heat until soft.</p>
        <p>2. Remove the stalks from the kale and wash the leaves. Chop them coarsely. Add them to the pan with the water and cook, stirring frequently, for 15 to 20 minutes, covered. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. When the liquid has been absorbed, add half a cup of the cream. Cook until absorbed, uncovered, stirring frequently. Add the rest of the cream and cook until absorbed. Sprinkle with the bacon and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Kale With Sausage And Noodles  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>4sweet Italian sausages</p>
        <p>2bunches kale</p>
        <p>2tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>2cloves garlic, minced</p>
        <p>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</p>
        <p>1teaspoon hot pepper flakes (or to taste)</p>
        <p>2tablespoons balsamic vinegar</p>
        <p>1pound cavatelli</p>
        <p>Freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <p>1. Chop the sausages and fry them until crisp. Pour off the fat and set the chopped sausage aside. Bring six quarts salted water to boil for the cavatelli.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, remove the stalks from the kale and wash the leaves. Chop them coarsely. Add the olive oil to the pan.</p>
        <p>3. Add the kale, allowing some of the leaves to wilt first so you have room in the pan, and the garlic. Season with salt, freshly ground pepper and hot pepper flakes to taste. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 15 minutes. Add the sausage and the balsamic vinegar, bring to boil and turn off heat.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, cook the cavatelli until al dente. Drain and toss with the kale and the sausage. Serve with the Parmesan passed separately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This can also be made with spicy Italian sausage, in which case omit the hot pepper.</p>
        <p>Kale With Anchovies, Potatoes and Hot Pepper  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2bunches kale</p>
        <p>4tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>2cloves garlic, minced</p>
        <p>1 1/2pounds small red potatoes, scrubbed, halved and sliced  1/4 inch thick</p>
        <p>1/2cup water</p>
        <p>1/2teaspoon crumbled dried hot chili peppers or crushed hot pepper</p>
        <p>6anchovy fillets, drained and cut into  1/2-inch pieces</p>
        <p>Lemon juice</p>
        <p>Freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Pull the kale leaves from the stalks and chop the leaves. Put two tablespoons of the oil in a flameproof casserole, add the garlic and stir over low heat until lightly colored. Add the potatoes and toss. Add the kale, water and hot pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Cover and cook over medium low heat until potatoes are just barely tender, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p>
        <p>3. Add anchovies and lemon juice to taste. Toss with remaining olive oil to taste. Serve sprinkled with black pepper.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
