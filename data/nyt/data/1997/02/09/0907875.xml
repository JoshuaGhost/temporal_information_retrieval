        <p>Kofi Annan captivated Capitol Hill. He dazzled financiers and political leaders at Davos.</p>
        <p>The United Nations' new Secretary General impresses nearly everyone he meets as ever so nice, but now they are discovering that he is also ever so cautious. And although  Washington and other capitals are reluctant to pass judgment so early on the man the Clinton Administration promoted as the organization's savior, some of his first moves -- or lack thereof -- have disappointed.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Annan's own admission, the job he assumed last month makes him ''the man in the middle,'' the chief administrative officer -- with very limited authority -- over only part of an unwieldy, decentralized, global system that takes orders from the 185 countries of the world that make up its membership.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to move the organization to go through with reform at a time when lots of people think that the United States is imposing reform and that the member states are not ready,'' he said in an interview on Friday in his office overlooking the East River. ''You can come with the best blueprint, but if you impose reform, you're never going to go anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether he had an impossible job before him, he replied, ''A friend of mine described it as a job from hell.''</p>
        <p>A career international civil servant from Ghana who is said to have never raised his voice with colleagues, Mr. Annan, 58, whose name is pronounced to rhyme with cannon, has survived and thrived in the labyrinthian United Nations bureaucracy for more than three decades because he prefers quiet, slow-moving consensus-building to dramatic, bold action.</p>
        <p>But it is precisely that quality that may make it hard for him to press the United Nations to change -- the only way the United States will pay more than $1 billion in back dues.</p>
        <p>In its 1998 budget proposal released on Thursday, the Administration proposed spending $100 million next year and $912 million in 1999 to pay its debt. However, the payments are contingent on a level of reform that the Administration and the Congress have yet to define.</p>
        <p>''It's not ideal, but given the history and circumstances it's probably the best we could get,'' Mr. Annan said, acknowledging that he has no choice but to accept the proposal even though the payments are not at all certain and even though the United Nations says the United States owes $300 million more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan disagrees that his studied, low-key style is a liability. ''There seems to be a sense out there that unless you are confrontational and get into contentious situations you are not tough, you are not a leader, you are not free,'' he said. ''I've never shared that view in my life and I'm not going to change now. I often tell my colleagues you can even win without fighting so why do I have to go and pick unnecessary fights.''</p>
        <p>Much to the dismay of the United States and some of the other big donors, Mr. Annan has announced that he will not have a comprehensive reform plan ready until late July at the earliest, after the entire United Nations membership has had an opportunity to weigh in.</p>
        <p>''A good leader must also be a good follower,'' he said of his decision to wait until all the other countries have their say.</p>
        <p>But the delay misses the opportunity to capitalize on the extraordinary goodwill surrounding Mr. Annan in succeeding Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Egyptian whose ouster was spearheaded by the United States.</p>
        <p>It also gives conservative Republicans in Congress time to preempt Mr. Annan with their own legislation.</p>
        <p>''I was a little surprised,'' said Princeton Lyman, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, of Mr. Annan's decision to take so much time. ''There are a number of steps we have all been waiting for, and frankly, we hope he takes them before July.''</p>
        <p>One change the United States and the world's six other largest industrial countries say they want is the merging of the United Nations' three economic departments under a single head, a proposal they formally presented last year.</p>
        <p>Even the departments' titles suggest duplication: the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development, the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis, and the Department for Development Support and Management Services.</p>
        <p>But when Edward W. Gnehm Jr., the acting chief American representative, and Ambassador Alain Dejamet of France met with Mr. Annan on Tuesday to press him for a decision on behalf of the group, he said he was not ready to make a decision, according to diplomats familiar with the meeting.</p>
        <p>In fact, they said, he changed the subject. And when the two envoys tried again, Mr. Annan refused to be pinned down.</p>
        <p>''This is an idea that has been around for a long time,'' said one diplomat. ''Even the Chinese seem to be in favor. It's all, well, a bit disappointing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan's reappointment of most of the senior bureaucracy at the United Nations -- many on contracts of three to five years -- instead of cleaning house has also dismayed the United States, some of the other members and even some officials inside the bureaucracy. He has even given plum assignments to several senior officials who openly lobbied against him for Mr. Boutros-Ghali.</p>
        <p>''Uninspired,'' is how one senior Administration official described the appointments.</p>
        <p>To that charge, Mr. Annan replied that the right time to make personnel changes is not in the midst of a far-reaching reform process. ''Change is a process; it's not an event,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, the way Mr. Annan has decided to organize his reform team is already causing confusion about who will do what.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan appointed Maurice Strong, a former businessman from Canada who has undertaken a number of United Nations missions, to a newly created post of ''executive coordinator for reform'' at a symbolic salary of $1 a year. But Mr. Strong reports directly to Mr. Annan, not to Joseph E. Connor, the American Under Secretary General in charge of the United Nations' administration and management.</p>
        <p>The two men are said to have a correct relationship at best.</p>
        <p>The Administration has expressed concern that Mr. Strong may usurp or duplicate some of the functions now performed by Mr. Connor, a former chairman and chief executive of Price Waterhouse, whom the Administration hand-picked to lead the reform effort three years ago.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Strong openly campaigned for a second term for Mr. Boutros-Ghali, predicting that efforts by Madeleine K. Albright, then the chief American representative, to oust him would fail.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Albright met with Mr. Annan before she left for Washington as Secretary of State, she had a two-word reaction to Mr. Strong's appointment, according to American officials: ''Why Strong?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan explained that Mr. Connor would continue to deal with making the United Nations more efficient, but that he needed Mr. Strong to reach out to the countries that belong to the United Nations and craft a plan reflecting their larger vision for change.</p>
        <p>''Reform is a full-time activity,'' Mr. Annan said in defending Mr. Strong's appointment. ''It is not something I can tag on to Mr. Connor's functions.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there is still a third reform apparatus: a handful of committees made up of all the countries in the United Nations, headed by Ismael Rezali of Malaysia, the president of the General Assembly, many with their own specific ideas of what does and does not need to be changed.</p>
        <p>As part of his conciliatory style and his determination to reach out to the United States Congress, Mr. Annan has invited a team from the staffs of several lawmakers, including that of Senator Jesse Helms,  chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an outspoken critic of the United Nations, to discuss reform at the organization next week.</p>
        <p>Mark Thiessen, Mr. Helms's spokesman, said the purpose of the meeting is to give Mr. Annan ''some input'' into the specific targets for the United Nations that Mr. Helms will include in legislation he intends to introduce before any taxpayers' money is spent on back dues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan said he is ''uncomfortable'' with specific targets dictated by Washington, but his gesture to consult closely with Congress at all has sparked criticism from other delegations that he is America's man at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''I am a free man,'' he insisted.</p>
        <p>He is a realist as well.</p>
        <p>''Without Congress the payment cannot be made,'' he said. ''To those who say, 'Aren't you setting a bad example and are you going to do the same for all the other 184 Parliaments in the world?' my answer is, 'I will devote the same attention to any country that pays 25 percent of the dues and owes $1.3 billion.' ''</p>
