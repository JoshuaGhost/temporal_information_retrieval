        <p>IT LOOKS ALMOST LIKE A POST-MODERN installation, Cimabue's ''Crucifixion'' suspended in midair by four stainless-steel cables in the damp, dark Santa Croce refectory. A masterpiece of 13th-century Italian painting, Cimabue's lyrical, sensual Christ still bears the wounds it suffered when the waters of the Arno River raged through the center of Florence in 1966.</p>
        <p>Should the flood waters return today, Cimabue's ''Crucifixion'' would be whisked away to safety, its 1,760 wooden pounds hoisted to a height of 26 feet by a series of sturdy manual pulleys.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, not all of Florence's artworks are so well protected. More than 30 years after the deluge, the city of Brunelleschi, Donatello, Michelangelo and Cellini still trembles each time the Arno rises. Santa Croce. Via Tornabuoni. Piazza del Duomo. The Uffizi Museum. There is not a monument in this monumental city that does not bear a marble plaque showing a high-water mark from the flood of Nov. 4, 1966. Four feet. Eight feet. Sometimes 10. Even in February, the river occasionally stirs from its midwinter torpor, reminding the city just how vulnerable it is and how little has been done to prevent another catastrophe.</p>
        <p>''In a certain sense, we have proceeded like someone who cleans out a room only to sweep the dirt beneath the carpet of another,'' says Antonio Paolucci, the city's superintendent of fine arts and the former Culture Minister of Italy. ''The city responded splendidly to the disaster of 1966. Yet the Arno was and remains a wicked, treacherous waterway. If we truly want to say our mea culpa, we should do so for not having found a way to tame it.''</p>
        <p>The Arno has always been a capricious and wanton river; historical accounts tell of 56 ''alluvial events'' in Florence since 1177. Although it is usually calm, the river that Dante Alighieri called ''the cursed and unlucky ditch'' is transformed during the rainy season from October to December. The Arno has many tributaries, and its limestone and granite basin allows for little absorption or runoff.</p>
        <p>''Florence, with its narrow river boulevards and its many bridges, represents a critical point for this river,'' says Simone Staccioli, director of the Florentine division of public works, which monitors rain and water levels along the river's basin.</p>
        <p>On the fateful November morning of the flood, the Arno submerged Florence's city center under 18 billion gallons of water, mud and filth. When the waters receded the next day, the city lay in waste. Thirty-nine people were killed, 10,000 cars destroyed and 20,000 residents left homeless.</p>
        <p>The damage to the city's monuments and artworks was almost unfathomable. Some 1,500 pieces had been disfigured or destroyed, including 320 panel paintings, 629 canvas paintings, 495 sculptures and 124 frescoes. The murky waters soaked nearly 1.5 million volumes at the Biblioteca Nazionale. The city's many cloisters and refectories -- some were decorated with murals by artists like Andrea del Castagno, Taddeo Gaddi and Filippo Lippi -- were steeped for hours in a messy mix of water, mud and gasoline.</p>
        <p>''An event like the 1966 flood can only be compared to a war,'' says Cristina Acidini, deputy superintendent for fine arts in Florence. ''In Florence, they were able to move the entire collection of the Uffizi into deposits before the bombardments began in World War II. But there was no warning given for the 1966 flood. And that one night was enough to create an enormous disaster from which we are still trying to recover.''</p>
        <p>FLORENCE MAY HAVE been caught unaware by the flood, but the city and its restorers responded splendidly. A climatized ''reanimation room'' was set up in a greenhouse at the Boboli Gardens to provide a safe, controlled environment to slowly dry the hundreds of soaked panel paintings. In the 12 months that followed, Florentine restorers removed 27,000 square feet of wet and stained frescoes from their supporting walls, thereby preserving a significant part of Florence's patrimony of wall paintings.</p>
        <p>Volunteers, including Richard Burton and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, came from around the world to help save the city's treasures. Dressed in rubber boots, working 10 to 14 hours a day, these volunteers came to be known as the angeli del fango, the angels of the mud.</p>
        <p>The Government eventually provided money to raise the flood barriers near the Uffizi to 26 feet and to dredge the river bottom under the Ponte Vecchio. But these measures were hardly sufficient to handle a volume of water like that of November 1966. Only in 1989 was the problem of the Arno River declared of pressing national interest. With the formation of the Arno Basin Authority, local, regional and national authorities began to search in earnest for ways to assure Florence's safety.</p>
        <p>''A river is a very complex and demanding organism,'' says Costanza Pera, director general of the institute for the safeguarding of Italian terrain at the Ministry of the Interior. ''You cannot resolve the problems of the Arno at Florence by simply altering the waterway at Florence,'' she says. ''You have to intervene at various points along the river. And in Italy, where we have a high density of population, much of which lives near or on our rivers, each of these choices means modifying the life of thousands of people.''</p>
        <p>Current plans to domesticate the Arno center on building a series of reservoirs upstream to handle excess volumes of water during heavy rains. Ms. Pera expects the 15-year Arno basin plan to cost $2.3 billion. Yet given Italy's perpetual fiscal travails, there is no guarantee that these funds will be forthcoming. Of the $180 million needed to begin work this year, the Government is unlikely to provide more than half.</p>
        <p>The memory of the 1966 flood is still vivid in the minds of Florentines. Each fall, when the rains begin, inhabitants pack the city's bridges and river banks, wringing their hands beneath their umbrellas as they watch the rising waters with a mix of fear and fascination. Should monitors upstream from Florence sound the alarm, Florentines would have only six hours to put their homes, museums, churches and monuments in order before the waters arrived. However, some permanent precautions have been taken.</p>
        <p>None of the city's museums store perishable artworks in street level or underground quarters. Each of the city's museums has an emergency plan, a sort of ''red envelope'' to be opened in the event of a disaster. Regular evacuation drills and protection drills are conducted.</p>
        <p>The latest exercise, held in Santa Croce on the 30th anniversary of the flood, involved more than 1,000 people including soldiers, police officers, firefighters and volunteers. Panel and canvas paintings were lifted to safety. Tens of thousands of volumes were packed into fruit crates and  transported to the upper floors of the Biblioteca Nazionale. Taddeo Gaddi's ''Arbor Vitae'' fresco on the rear wall of the Santa Croce refectory was covered with a custom-fitted water-repellent cloth.</p>
        <p>While the Santa Croce drill was conducted flawlessly, there is no guarantee that the exercise would function as smoothly under actual emergency conditions. With the roads clogged by inhabitants fleeing the city center, it would be difficult for volunteers to reach their posts in time. And not every quarter is as well organized or farsighted as Santa Croce.</p>
        <p>''I think that we've done everything within our power to keep the damage to a minimum in the event of another flood,'' says Mr. Paolucci. ''But what we really need to do is make sure that there will be no other flood.''</p>
