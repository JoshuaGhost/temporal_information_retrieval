        <p>It has been 32 years since Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, a British yachtsman knighted for his global exploits, completed the world's first solo, nonstop, round-the-world voyage. Now Sir Robin has a land-bound quest: to look into the safety of new sailboats following in his oceanic footsteps.</p>
        <p>''It's a question of stability,'' the 57-year-old Sir Robin said in a telephone interview from England. ''We've had four boats disappear recently in the Southern Ocean. One boat has disappeared completely, and two French boats overturned. Another boat's keel fell off. This has opened up a can of worms. A sailboat that turns upside down should come upright again.''</p>

        <p>It has been 32 years since Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, a British yachtsman knighted for his global exploits, completed the world's first solo, nonstop, round-the-world voyage. Now Sir Robin has a land-bound quest: to look into the safety of new sailboats following in his oceanic footsteps.</p>
        <p>''It's a question of stability,'' the 57-year-old Sir Robin said in a telephone interview from England. ''We've had four boats disappear recently in the Southern Ocean. One boat has disappeared completely, and two French boats overturned. Another boat's keel fell off. This has opened up a can of worms. A sailboat that turns upside down should come upright again.''</p>
        <p>Sir Robin was referring to the Vendee Globe Challenge, a 23,000-mile race in which 17 solo sailors left Les Sables-d'Olonne, France, Nov. 3 in a nonstop race around the world. Since then, 10 sailors have retired from the competition. Three of them abandoned their boats at sea. A fourth, Gerry Roufs of Canada, disappeared completely.</p>
        <p>Christophe Auguin of France is expected to win the global competition this week. He is close to beating the 102-day, single-handed monohull record. But the misadventures of other sailors en route will probably upstage his feat.</p>
        <p>A five-member international committee has been formed to examine the stability of the Open 60 Class, the 60-foot yacht division competing in the world's two premier races: the Vendee competition, and Around Alone, a new solo yacht race that succeeds the former BOC Challenge.</p>
        <p>Mark Schrader, a veteran solo sailor who is race director for Around Alone, said recently that the new yachts are not inherently unsafe. But the committee needs to address the question of stability in response to recent mishaps.</p>
        <p>''We may be jumping to conclusions,'' Schrader said. ''In the BOC races, competitors sailed more than 2.2 million miles since the inaugural BOC event in 1982-83. Why did the boats go over recently? Were the boats unstable, or were they freak accidents? People ought to know.''</p>
        <p>In the four BOC competitions staged since 1982, 87 sailors crossed the start lines, and 56 finished. Unlike the three nonstop Vendee Globe Challenges since 1989, the BOC races included three stopovers. Two BOC sailors died, and eight boats were lost at sea, or wrecked.</p>
        <p>In the Vendee races, 44 competitors started, and fewer than one-fourth finished. One sailor died, and another, the late Mike Plant of Jamestown, R.I., was lost at sea in the Atlantic Ocean on his way to the Vendee start in 1992.</p>
        <p>The accidents were not necessarily related to boat design or construction. Some yachts hit icebergs or submerged objects; others were in collisions or were pummeled in powerful waves.</p>
        <p>But it is not overall safety that is the committee's concern. Schrader said that the yachts generally have held up remarkably well given the extreme conditions in which they sail. The Southern Oceans, which include portions of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans, are known to brew 100-foot waves and winds of hurricane force.</p>
        <p>Rather, Schrader said, the committee needs to find out whether the new shapes of the 1990-generation boats create a stable craft. In particular, they are examining the viability of hulls as wide as 21 feet, and as low to the water as a frying pan on a burner.</p>
        <p>Last month, the 65-foot Vendee yacht being sailed by Tony Bullimore of England overturned about 2,000 miles southwest of Australia. The yacht lost its keel, the ballasted section of the yacht that keeps it upright. The 56-year-old yachtsman was trapped in an air pocket inside the boat's hull for four days before being rescued.</p>
        <p>There was no question why Bullimore's boat did not right itself, given that its keel fell off. But why didn't two French yachts that capsized in nearly the same period come upright again?</p>
        <p>Neither sailboat appeared to have lost its keel before finally sinking. Evidence suggests that other calamities caused by the severe wind and waves may have added to their instability, Schrader said. The committee plans to look at these incidents in updating safety rules developed in 1983 for the BOC Challenge.</p>
