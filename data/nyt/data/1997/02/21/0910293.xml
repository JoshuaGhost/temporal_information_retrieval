        <p>Tracing Degas's Taste</p>
        <p>Most museum and gallery exhibitions focus on what artists created rather than what they collected. Artists' own collections rarely remain intact, and when they can be pieced together, as with ''The Private Collection of Edgar Degas,'' a show that opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in October, it is unusual indeed. This grouping of more than 200 paintings, pastels, watercolors, drawings and prints by 19th-century French artists will give viewers a portrait of Degas's taste, his work process, his pleasures and his circle of friends.</p>
        <p>Since a majority of the works from Degas's collection were sold at auctions in Paris soon after his death in 1918 and are traceable to museums and private collections, four curators (Gary Tinterow, Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein of the Metropolitan and Ann Dumas, a freelance art historian) were able to assemble many of them. Some works were easy to track down. At the Paris auctions eight decades ago, representatives of the National Gallery in London, the Metropolitan and the Louvre were all on hand to buy parts of Degas's collection. The National Gallery and other British institutions bought a group of French paintings. One painting by El Greco was purchased by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, another by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The Metropolitan acquired two Ingres portraits, and the Louvre bought works by Delacroix and Ingres.</p>

        <p>Tracing Degas's Taste</p>
        <p>Most museum and gallery exhibitions focus on what artists created rather than what they collected. Artists' own collections rarely remain intact, and when they can be pieced together, as with ''The Private Collection of Edgar Degas,'' a show that opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in October, it is unusual indeed. This grouping of more than 200 paintings, pastels, watercolors, drawings and prints by 19th-century French artists will give viewers a portrait of Degas's taste, his work process, his pleasures and his circle of friends.</p>
        <p>Since a majority of the works from Degas's collection were sold at auctions in Paris soon after his death in 1918 and are traceable to museums and private collections, four curators (Gary Tinterow, Colta Ives and Susan Alyson Stein of the Metropolitan and Ann Dumas, a freelance art historian) were able to assemble many of them. Some works were easy to track down. At the Paris auctions eight decades ago, representatives of the National Gallery in London, the Metropolitan and the Louvre were all on hand to buy parts of Degas's collection. The National Gallery and other British institutions bought a group of French paintings. One painting by El Greco was purchased by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, another by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. The Metropolitan acquired two Ingres portraits, and the Louvre bought works by Delacroix and Ingres.</p>
        <p>But many collectors were also auction buyers, and their purchases were more challenging to find. The curators have spent six months tracking these works down.</p>
        <p>Degas began buying art seriously in the 1890's, when sales of his own artworks allowed him to indulge his passion for collecting. He amassed a group of works by contemporaries like Cezanne, Gauguin, Cassatt and Pissarro. He was obsessed with his friend Manet's work and patiently assembled a set of over 50 Manet prints. Degas also owned two paintings and a drawing by van Gogh. Less predictable areas of his collection include two paintings by El Greco and a large array of Japanese prints. ''Degas collected a small number of artists in depth,'' Mr. Tinterow said. ''He was in no way trying to make a collection that was representative of the art of his time. Many of these works had meaning to him because they gave him insight into his craft as an artist.''</p>
        <p>Degas also held on to some of his own works because for a time he had thoughts of opening a museum in his Paris home. Thirty of them will be included in the show.</p>
        <p>A considerably smaller exhibition of Degas's collection was held in London last summer alongside ''Degas Beyond Impressionism,'' the blockbuster show at the National Gallery in London. Mr. Tinterow said he had viewed the smaller show in London and decided with its curator, Ms. Dumas, that it could be expanded. ''But I wanted to make this the main course,'' he said, ''not just the dessert.'' The Degas show is to run from Oct. 1 through Jan. 11 at the Met. Financing is being provided by Texaco.</p>
        <p>A Shift at the Whitney</p>
        <p>The Whitney Museum of American Art has announced the participants in this year's Biennial, which opens on March 20. The list is laden with new arrivals, many of them young. Of 70 artists, 26 are under 35, including Kara Walker, an installation artist from Los Angeles; T. J. Wilcox, a Los Angeles film and installation artist, and Katy Schimert, a New York City sculptor and film maker.</p>
        <p>Many installation artists are represented, while painting is rather lightly represented by such artists as Lari Pittman, Sue Williams, Vija Celmins and Kerry James Marshall. The list is balanced with established names like Louise Bourgeois, Ed Ruscha, Robert Wilson, Richard Prince, Dan Graham, Chris Burden and Bruce Nauman.</p>
        <p>While the Biennial has always included foreign-born artists working in the United States or foreign artists who have had an impact on American culture, this category is larger than ever.</p>
        <p>The show's organizers, Lisa Phillips, a Whitney curator, and Louise Neri, the United States editor for Parkett, an international art journal, say they are exploring the theme of American nationalism. Among those taking part are Shashwati Talukdar, an Indian-born artist from Philadelphia; Shahzia Sikander, a Pakistani who lives in Houston; Gabriel Orozco, who is Mexican but lives in New York City, and Ilya Kabakov, the Russian Conceptualist, who divides his time between Moscow and New York.</p>
        <p>The Provenance Is the Key</p>
        <p>Sotheby's plans to sell an extraordinary group of works by 1980's and 90's artists in a series of auctions in New York and London beginning in May.</p>
        <p>That the collection, which is expected to sell for $4 million to $6 million, includes prime examples of works by Gerhard Richter, Robert Gober, Jeff Koons, Sigmar Polke, Rachel Whiteread and Bruce Nauman is compelling enough. But the provenance is even more interesting: the collection was formed by Dr. Bernardo Nadal-Ginard, a Boston cardiologist who was accused of misappropriating money from a nonprofit medical foundation that conducts research on heart disease in children and cares for them.</p>
        <p>In December 1994, the United States District Court in Boston entered a judgment against Dr. Nadal-Ginard and in favor of the nonprofit Boston Children's Heart Foundation, saying the doctor owed it nearly $6.6 million.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nadal-Ginard was accused of diverting money from the foundation for his own use. Judge Robert Keeton had determined that Dr. Nadal-Ginard had abused his responsibility and acted in bad faith by improperly taking millions of dollars from the foundation.</p>
        <p>The Boston Children's Heart Foundation is the seller of the collection. All proceeds from the sales will go to the research endowment of the Department of Cardiology at Children's Hospital, which is part of Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <p>''We relied upon a number of professionals who advised us on how to best handle the sale of the art,'' said David Wessel, a cardiologist who is the treasurer of the foundation.</p>
