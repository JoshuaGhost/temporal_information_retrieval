        <p>''Swiss Begin to Question Image of Heroism in War'' (news article, Feb. 8) gives the impression that the ''heroic mythology'' of World War II it describes is still the way that history is viewed in Switzerland and that only recent accusations have forced it to reassess the past.</p>
        <p>Such propagandistic notions as the ''Alpine redoubt'' have been rejected by most Swiss for quite some time and are alien to younger generations like mine.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Swiss Begin to Question Image of Heroism in War'' (news article, Feb. 8) gives the impression that the ''heroic mythology'' of World War II it describes is still the way that history is viewed in Switzerland and that only recent accusations have forced it to reassess the past.</p>
        <p>Such propagandistic notions as the ''Alpine redoubt'' have been rejected by most Swiss for quite some time and are alien to younger generations like mine.</p>
        <p>Switzerland's dealings with Nazi Germany and the turning back of Jewish refugees are facts that I was taught in school, while no notion of any wartime heroism was ever mentioned.</p>
        <p>This certainly goes against your article's assertion that any challenges to the ''nation's mythology'' have not had ''much resonance.''</p>
        <p>That many of the revelations over the country's wartime behavior were, if not commonly accepted, at least discussed within Switzerland only adds to my feeling that not all of the current accusations are fully deserved.</p>
