        <p>Lemieux Scores 600th Goal</p>
        <p>Mario Lemieux waited until the final minute to become the seventh member of the National Hockey League's 600-goal club, scoring an empty-net goal with 56 seconds left as the host Pittsburgh Penguins held off the Vancouver Canucks by 6-4 last night.</p>
        <p>The fans chanted, ''Mar-i-o! Mar-i-o!'' and threw hats on the rink -- normally a display reserved for a hat trick. Lemieux acknowledged a standing ovation with a wave of his stick as the video board replayed historic goals from his 13-year career.</p>

        <p>N.H.L.</p>
        <p>Lemieux Scores 600th Goal</p>
        <p>Mario Lemieux waited until the final minute to become the seventh member of the National Hockey League's 600-goal club, scoring an empty-net goal with 56 seconds left as the host Pittsburgh Penguins held off the Vancouver Canucks by 6-4 last night.</p>
        <p>The fans chanted, ''Mar-i-o! Mar-i-o!'' and threw hats on the rink -- normally a display reserved for a hat trick. Lemieux acknowledged a standing ovation with a wave of his stick as the video board replayed historic goals from his 13-year career.</p>
        <p>Lemieux accomplished the feat in his 719th game, one fewer game than it took Wayne Gretzky to do it. The Penguins' Joe Mullen scored his 498th career goal as Pittsburgh improved to 17-5-3 at home. Mullen needs two more to become the first United States-born player to score 500 goals.</p>

        <p>FLYERS 1, SABRES 1: Joel Otto scored with 1 minute 55 seconds left to give Philadelphia a tie with visiting Buffalo. Shjon Podein fed Otto from behind the net, and Otto punched it past goalie Dominik Hasek while falling down. The late score spoiled a stellar effort by Hasek, who stopped 27 shots. Donald Audette scored the Sabres' only goal during a second-period power play, slapping it in from the right face-off circle.</p>

        <p>BLUES 1, RED WINGS 1: The team that gave Scotty Bowman his first N.H.L. victory almost 30 years ago denied him No. 1,000 last night. Bowman remained at 999 victories as the St. Louis rookie Jim Campbell scored an unassisted goal in the third period to forge a 1-1 tie between the visiting Blues and Bowman's Detroit Red Wings. No other coach in hockey has won 1,000 games.</p>

        <p>SENATORS 4, BRUINS 3: Andreas Dackell scored Ottawa's third power-play goal, breaking a tie with 6:44 left, as the Senators extended their unbeaten road streak to four games with a victory over Boston. The Bruins tied the game, 3-3, on Ted Donato's second goal of the game, on a power play, with 8:52 to play. But Dackell got his ninth goal of the season just 24 seconds after Mattias Timander was penalized for slashing.</p>

        <p>LIGHTNING 2, COYOTES 0: Chris Gratton notched a goal 17 seconds into the game, and Tampa Bay snapped a three-game road losing streak. The Lightning scored twice in its first six shots and made the lead stand up with sticky defense and effective work by goaltender Rick Tabaracci, who stopped all 21 Phoenix shots for his 11th career shutout.</p>

        <p>BOWLING</p>
        <p>Well, Somebody Is Perfect</p>
        <p>United States bowling officials formally recognized perfection yesterday in approving a record performance by a college student who bowled three consecutive perfect games of 300.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Sonnenfeld, a student at the University of Nebraska, became the first bowler ever to roll a 900 series officially, the American Bowling Congress said. Sonnenfeld, a 20-year-old sophomore from Sioux Falls, S.D., set the record Sunday at the Junior Husker Tournament at Sun Valley Lanes in Lincoln.</p>
