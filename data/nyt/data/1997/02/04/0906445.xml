        <p>It could be argued that nearly every major designer breakthrough of the last 50 years has been based on a new take on the suit.</p>
        <p>Prada had one. Gucci had one. And well before the 1990's, so did Giorgio Armani, Chanel and Christian Dior. All of the greatest designers have a suit signature. John Galliano's is long and fluid; Karl Lagerfeld's has a hint of German Expressionism, with slim shoulders but sharp angled collars and squared buttons.</p>

        <p>It could be argued that nearly every major designer breakthrough of the last 50 years has been based on a new take on the suit.</p>
        <p>Prada had one. Gucci had one. And well before the 1990's, so did Giorgio Armani, Chanel and Christian Dior. All of the greatest designers have a suit signature. John Galliano's is long and fluid; Karl Lagerfeld's has a hint of German Expressionism, with slim shoulders but sharp angled collars and squared buttons.</p>
        <p>But those things charmingly called ''day clothes'' by couture (no one wants to suggest that ladies who buy couture work for a living) did not drive this successful spring season. In fact, where day clothes arose, they dragged things down, a downer at Pierre Balmain, a downer at Chanel, a downer at Emanuel Ungaro, silly at Thierry Mugler and nearly invisible at Christian Lacroix, Gianni Versace, Givenchy and Valentino.</p>
        <p>There were no revolutions in couture this round, basically because there were virtually no suits, and fashion revolutions are made of them. Instead, the shows concentrated on evening wear, with the most revolutionary idea being one that was overused in ready-to-wear last season: sheer, transparent, lightweight fabrics.</p>
        <p>Suggesting that the economy is strong enough for galas yet again -- the sort of galas that demand a $100,000 dress -- the best couture pieces were for those events.</p>
        <p>The most experimental dresses were at Gianni Versace, where the designer referenced three artists, one on each layer of gowns. One dress was like a Calder mobile in fabric. There was a similar offbeat beauty to Mr. Lacroix's gowns, ornamented with clumps of beads or jewels, fresh variations on traditional beading. Valentino's most innovative work was dresses of patchworks of floral fabrics and lace.</p>
        <p>Lacroix, Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent were client favorites, sure signals that the change that clients accept (and expect) for ready-to-wear is not what couture clients want to see on runways. Those three shows were without hype, with nothing for the fronts of London tabloids and with little for day that would find its way into the more abstract editorial pages of fashion magazines.</p>
        <p>There is nothing abstract about the sales those houses do in couture each season, astounding for a business that is a loss leader. Chanel let it be known that last couture season, six $175,000 beaded jackets based on Coco Chanel's screens were sold -- to the same customer.</p>
        <p>The lightweight clothes that were couture's message, in sheer lace, scissored tulle and organza and improbably seamless, are really possible only when the work is done by hand. One dress at Versace was so sheer that it had to be remade three times, since the task of applying beads, appliques and embroidery to such delicate fabric was so arduous.</p>
        <p>Lightness was the response the designers seemed to have collectively formed to those who have argued that there is little place left for the art. To get the effect at Chanel of a scalloped hem, made of panels sewn together, or the patchwork of delicate lace at Valentino or the bias-cut lace at Pierre Balmain by Oscar de la Renta or the crazy quilt of brocade at Lacroix, couture techniques are the only option. If there was daring in the transparency throughout the collections, there won't be once the couture clients are fitted with requisite linings and slips, another advantage couture clients have over ready-to-wear buyers.</p>
        <p>But despite the raciest, most revealing dresses couture has ever offered, there was something rampantly traditional in the 10-ounce creations of cobweb threads and tissue fabrics, conventionally beautiful for conventional clients. The most balanced collections, conventional and unconventional, day wear and evening wear, were by two first-timers: Jean-Paul Gaultier and John Galliano, the latter in his couture debut for Christian Dior.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaultier has the advantage of having created a signature suit long ago. And his pin-stripe versions were the ones that the actress Charlotte Rampling, certainly the chic ideal for a modern couture customer, said she would buy if she had to pick from the half-dozen shows she saw.</p>
        <p>She also loved Christian Dior. And Mr. Galliano pulled off an impressive mix. He did his own signature fluid, cuffed pants suits, with mink trim; Dior's houndstooth signature skirted suits, this time in micro-minis with fitted jackets and strands of pearls at the throat, and a houndstooth skirt with a leather jacket cut like lace.</p>
        <p>For once, the boldest, brashest designers who went farthest out on a limb, Alexander McQueen for Givenchy and Thierry Mugler, were off base.</p>
        <p>Usually bold, brash design makes the conservative houses seem anemic. But Mr. Mugler's wildly creative show, based on beautifully made bug costumes, had little to offer the customers, who were treated so well elsewhere. And Mr. McQueen's show revisited so closely the themes of his own past collections that it seemed too strange for Givenchy couture and not creative enough for his own name.</p>
        <p>It could simply be that Mr. McQueen isn't really expected to cater to the old customers of Givenchy and hasn't yet decided who the new ones are.</p>
        <p>Yet, anyone who needs more evidence that a generational shift is happening and that Mr. McQueen will be forced into the forefront of it no matter how difficult it is for him should read an interview with him by David Bowie in the January issue of the British magazine Dazed and Confused.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowie's first question is, ''Are you gay, and do you take drugs?'' And Mr. McQueen's response is, ''Yes to both of them,'' adding afterward that his drug of choice is ''a man called Charlie!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowie comments: ''There's something a lot more pagan about your work compared, say, to Gaultier. Your things work at a more organic level.'' And Mr. McQueen replies: ''Possibly. I gather some influence from the Marquis de Sade, because I actually think of him as a great philosopher and a man of his time, where people found him just a pervert. I find him sort of influential in the way he provokes people's thoughts. It kind of scares me.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McQueen kind of scares people, too, especially Hubert de Givenchy's elderly clients. In a dainty season, even if his show wasn't a success, it was an attempt to offer an antidote.</p>
        <p>There is a place for the work Mr. McQueen is capable of producing for Givenchy, a customer who, like him, wants to provoke people's thoughts instead of boring them with beauty. His first show was many things, but boring it was not.</p>
