        <p>'Goldberg' Variations  For Strings, and Why Not?</p>
        <p>New European Strings Chamber Orchestra  Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>Of the many performers who have based careers largely on Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations, most, obviously, have been keyboard players. Dmitry Sitkovetsky, a violinist, is not one to be left out. Mr. Sitkovetsky arranged the work first for string trio, a version he recorded with Gerard Causse and Misha Maisky in 1984 for Orfeo, then for string orchestra, a version he recorded with the New European Strings Chamber Orchestra in 1993 for Nonesuch and presented in concert on Saturday evening.</p>

        <p>'Goldberg' Variations  For Strings, and Why Not?</p>
        <p>New European Strings Chamber Orchestra  Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>Of the many performers who have based careers largely on Bach's ''Goldberg'' Variations, most, obviously, have been keyboard players. Dmitry Sitkovetsky, a violinist, is not one to be left out. Mr. Sitkovetsky arranged the work first for string trio, a version he recorded with Gerard Causse and Misha Maisky in 1984 for Orfeo, then for string orchestra, a version he recorded with the New European Strings Chamber Orchestra in 1993 for Nonesuch and presented in concert on Saturday evening.</p>
        <p>No harm done, certainly; Bach's sturdy music, it has been proved over centuries, will survive almost any medium. And understandably, musicians love to perform it. But what does the audience stand to gain from such a venture?</p>
        <p>Leopold Stokowski's Bach transcriptions, often exhilarating, sometimes bizarre, invariably added one huge personality to another, and they were, to say the least, idiomatic for full orchestra. Mr. Sitkovetsky's current ''Goldberg'' arrangement turns many of Bach's limpid streams viscous, adding little of interest. What's more, it leaves most of the players idle most of the time, giving the juiciest lines to soloists, not least Mr. Sitkovetsky himself.</p>
        <p>That said, the audience here seemed content despite playing that was often casual in rhythm and intonation. Mr. Sitkovetsky also conducted the orchestra, which he founded in 1990, in Stravinsky's Concerto in D and Mr. Sitkovetsky's own arrangement of the sextet from Richard Strauss's ''Capriccio,'' with no particular character.</p>
