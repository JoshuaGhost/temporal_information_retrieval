        <p>The stream of visitors to the tidy stone house on a hillside here never let up today.</p>
        <p>Friends, relatives and well-wishers kissed and hugged Abir al-Wehaidi, who was freed on Tuesday night in the release of 30 Palestinian women from Israeli jails under the accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>One look at her family's house, bristling with Palestinian flags, pictures of Yasir Arafat and welcome banners, showed that Miss Wehaidi, 27, is no ordinary woman to the people of this town, but a symbol of resistance.</p>
        <p>''Welcome, Abir, to free Palestinian soil,'' a wall slogan said. A bright banner celebrated ''the return of the struggler, sister Abir al-Wehaidi.'' And a well-wisher greeted Miss Wehaidi with: ''You light up all of Palestine!'' Guns were fired in the air when she arrived home early today.</p>
        <p>Sentenced in 1992 to 17 years in jail  for membership in an armed group that killed a Jewish settler, Miss Wehaidi has become a national heroine to Palestinians, even as she is condemned by many Israelis as a terrorist with ''blood on her hands.''</p>
        <p>Poised and showing defiant resolve hardened by four and a half years behind bars, Miss Wehaidi recounted today how she took up arms during a during a seven-year Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation known as the intifada.</p>
        <p>Her transformation from a politically active college student to an armed militant was in many ways the story of a generation of young Palestinians molded by the uprising  who have emerged as a potent home-grown leadership in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Heavily involved in the street protests of the uprising when she was a student at Bir Zeit University, Miss Wehaidi joined an underground cell of the mainstream Fatah faction in the P.L.O. She was spurred to action, she recalled today, by the heavy Palestinian casualties inflicted by Israeli soldiers putting down the unrest, and particularly by the death of a close friend in a clash.</p>
        <p>''That was the zero hour,'' she said today in an interview. ''We saw the martyrs, the wounded on the hospital beds, and the pain pushed us to action. The pain was being felt by only one side, and it was high time the Israeli side felt the importance of peace. Unfortunately if people don't suffer, they don't comprehend it.''</p>
        <p>Miss Wehaidi obtained a contraband gun and made four drive-by shooting attempts at soldiers and settlers, wounding one person in the shoulder. She recalled shooting at one couple traveling to a Jewish settlement. The car was hit, but no one was hurt.</p>
        <p>How did she feel when she fired at civilians? ''Settlers, not civilians,'' Miss Wehaidi replied. ''I was doing my duty. I considered myself a soldier, and every soldier does his duty.''</p>
        <p>In a separate shooting by another member of the cell, Zvi Klein, from the Jewish settlement of Ofra, was killed. Does Miss Wehaidi have any regrets? ''Of course not,'' she said. ''He is a settler and this is occupied land. Their existence here is illegal, and this was legal resistance to occupation. There was no other way.''</p>
        <p>But now, after the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian accords, there are ''different conditions and a different way of struggle -- negotiations,'' Miss Wehaidi said, adding that armed resistance is ''not for this time.''</p>
        <p>Although she is critical of the accords, arguing that they gave the Palestinians nothing more than isolated patches of territory, Miss Wehaidi said she hoped that progress could be made toward statehood, providing that Israel dealt fairly with the Palestinians.</p>
        <p>But she said her first priority was to work for the release of the rest of the Palestinian prisoners, a problem she calls an open wound that must be closed.</p>
        <p>As for her years in jail, they were a lesson in the power of solidarity, Miss Wehaidi said. When President Ezer Weizman of Israel refused in October 1995 to pardon three women in prison convicted of involvement in murder, all the rest of the women refused to go free, although the Israelis were ready to release them under the accords. And while hundreds of male prisoners were released in the following months, the women stayed back, insisting that they would only leave together.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Weizman issued the outstanding pardons, the women went through one last trial on Tuesday, when last-minute court appeals held up their release until late at night. But in the end, they were all freed.</p>
        <p>''We felt a sense of victory,'' Miss Wehaidi recalled. ''What we had dreamt about for days and long months, and what people had doubted, was coming true. We were one unit. The unity of the women prisoners was a great achievement.''</p>
