        <p>The bleacher section closest to the television cameras has been Italian country since these world Alpine ski championships began.</p>
        <p>Last week, the section was brimming with bonhomie and Deborah Compagnoni banners as she won two gold medals, and this morning, it was brimming with optimism and Alberto Tomba posters for the first run of the men's giant slalom.</p>
        <p>But by afternoon, the posters had come down and the Italian optimists had been replaced by exuberant Swiss and Austrian realists brandishing cowbells.</p>
        <p>Tomba had already missed most of the World Cup season for a variety of reasons, and this morning he missed the second run of the giant slalom after missing a gate one minute into the first run and sliding dispiritedly and anticlimactically to a halt.</p>
        <p>''I am angry, but I did my best,'' Tomba said. ''I thought I had trained pretty well, but this course was more difficult than I imagined.''</p>
        <p>Even if he had not missed the gate, Tomba was in no position to threaten the eventual gold medalist, Michael Von Gruenigen of Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Tomba was certainly not alone. The tight course set for the first run by the Norwegian coach, Max Valquist, turned out to be a gauntlet. Of the 15 seeded skiers, six did not complete the run, including Urs Kaelin of Switzerland and Jure Kosir of Slovenia. Over all, 55 of the 108 competitors failed to finish.</p>
        <p>The second-run course, set by Fritz Zuger of Switzerland, posed considerably fewer problems, and Von Gruenigen, who had built a lead of more than a second in the morning, maintained that advantage with his customary style and poise. His aggregate time of 2 minutes 48.23 seconds was 1.12 seconds better than the silver medalist, Lasse Kjus of Norway and 1.45 seconds better than Andreas Schifferer of Austria.</p>
        <p>Von Gruenigen is a technical specialist who has won 10 giant slaloms since 1993 but no other events. He is a skier's skier who elicits superlatives from his peers for his clean turns and grace. ''Extraordinary,'' said Kjetil-Andre Aamodt of Norway. ''He skis like in the textbooks.''</p>
        <p>Although Tomba and Von Gruenigen have both won gold medals at these championships, they have little else in common. Tomba is a child of privilege who grew up in a cosmopolitan city, Bologna, and is an extrovert. Von Gruenigen was orphaned at age 9 and raised by his older sisters. He grew up in the small German-speaking village of Schoenried and he is so self-contained that the Swiss joke that one of his hobbies is silence.</p>
        <p>But Von Gruenigen was hardly taciturn after the race, making it clear he did not appreciate Tomba's casual approach to World Cup competition this season.</p>
        <p>Tomba flirted with retirement last summer, and broke his right wrist in October. But since returning to the circuit, he has skipped several races and fell in his only giant slalom before Sestriere.</p>
        <p>''To me, it's skiing that should be at the forefront,'' Von Gruenigen said. ''If someone wants to party and only be interested in the world championships that's his business. I do all the events. Alberto has deliberately decided to concentrate only on this one, and in a certain sense, that is not fair to the other guys who race all the time.''</p>
