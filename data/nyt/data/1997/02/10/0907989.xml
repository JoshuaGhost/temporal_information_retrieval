        <p>LATE afternoon outside Madison Square Garden, on 33d Street near the corner of Eighth Avenue. Family members, as always, wait for Felipe Lopez to finish his business for the day. A shower. Interviews. The cleanup following another St. John's defeat, the sixth in succession, one more time to explain why he and his team are not what people once upon a time decided they would be.</p>
        <p>Anthony Lopez apologized to a reporter he didn't quite remember from an interview a couple of years ago.</p>
        <p>''I was talking to so many people then,'' he said.</p>
        <p>More, perhaps, than the cozy crowd that left tracts of the Garden as empty as St. John's felt yesterday, after Boston College's Mickey Curley put back a missed jumper by Scoonie Penn for a thrilling 81-80 overtime victory. Then, when Anthony Lopez's kid brother was a freshman, the whole basketball world seemed to be waiting on the slender 6-foot-6-inch Dominican prodigy who, as a Bronx high school senior, fastened a feather to a headband at a  news conference to announce his choice of Division I pleasure.</p>
        <p>''Three years,'' Felipe Lopez said yesterday in another losing locker room, ''and it feels like the blink of an eye.''</p>
        <p>He was going to be St. John's savior of the 90's, the Chris Mullin of color, except that Lopez's jump shot was never as feathery and he had no way of knowing that the tribe he was joining was about to be leveled by storm. No star upperclassmen to guide him and no creative point guard to assist him. A coach (Brian Mahoney) in trouble and a co-star (Zendon Hamilton) as mistake-prone as he. The Red Storm messiah, for better or worse, is now the sideline cyclone, Fran Fraschilla. A handful of games from the end of Felipe Lopez's junior season, no one but his family waits on him anymore.</p>
        <p>''Let me tell you something: Felipe is going to come out of this a lot better off than when he went in,'' Anthony Lopez said out on 33d Street, standing a few feet from his father. ''People say, 'He's not this; he's not that.' But we are proud of him for what he is, not for what the media and other people said he was supposed to be.</p>
        <p>''We were not the ones who said he was going to be the next great N.B.A. player or anything else. Felipe came to America for opportunity. He got that at St. John's. He's going to get a degree. And I still think that he will earn money from playing professional basketball, and not in the C.B.A. or in Europe.''</p>
        <p>On the subject of his three years at St. John's, Felipe Lopez is so diplomatic he could pass for a political science major. There are -- publicly, at least -- no villains, no scapegoats. There is, he insists, no point in dwelling on the unmet expectations that crush contributions such as yesterday's 12 points and 9 rebounds. There is still time. He could average 20 as a senior, catch up yet in the pros with those peers who've left him behind. ''If we win even one year,'' he said, ''then everything we went through for three years will be forgotten.''</p>
        <p>It is harder for his family, sitting in the stands in Jamaica, Queens, or in the Garden, while scattered jeers meet his introduction or an untimely air ball. ''If you've followed the program, you know what sacrifices Felipe's had to make,'' his brother said, presumably meaning, in part, the lack of a point guard and a fluid transition offense that could better use his verticality and speed.</p>
        <p>The sight of the 6-11 Hamilton leading a 3-on-1 fast break in the second half, with Lopez and the promising freshman point guard, Collin Charles, was his case in point. Wrong man with the ball. Pass out of bounds. The story of this team's life. But that was just 1 of 21 Red Storm turnovers, of which Lopez committed 5. The fundamental truth about Lopez and Hamilton under Mahoney and now Fraschilla is that they seldom make the basic plays.</p>
        <p>Late in the second half, they did execute a give-and-go, Hamilton rewarding a cutting Lopez with a pass off the right post for a layup. The simplicity of the play was startling, in the context of so many other attempts to force the ball to the rim through rush-hour crowds.</p>
        <p>Both coaches, Fraschilla and the Eagles' Jim O'Brien, commented that St. John's was most likely one basket away when it led by 5 points early in overtime. But Hamilton -- who otherwise had a fine game, with 28 points -- dribbled into a baseline trap, lost the ball and the Eagles scored. Lopez drove recklessly in the lane, lost the ball and the Eagles scored. A wild shootout ensued, but Curley was left untouched by Hamilton for the end-game basket.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes,'' Lopez said of a rash of close defeats, ''it's like that movie, 'Groundhog Day.' ''</p>
        <p>He finished dressing, took the elevator down, walked onto 33d Street, and smiled when he saw those he knew would be there. Still waiting, alone, against expectations and odds.</p>
