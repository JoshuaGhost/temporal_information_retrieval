        <p>President Clinton's goal in the budget he proposed last week for higher education is to make college more affordable.</p>
        <p>But economists say that if the plan of tuition tax breaks for the middle class and more and bigger Pell grants for needy students is carried out, colleges are likely to raise tuition. At least some of the money, they say, would end up in college treasuries rather than family pocketbooks.</p>
        <p>''The economics certainly suggest tuition increases,'' said David W. Breneman, an economist and dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. ''The only question is whether there are sufficiently high public-relations and political pressures to act as brakes.''</p>
        <p>The cost of attending college has spiraled upward faster than inflation for years, stretching the resources of many families and putting college beyond the reach of some.</p>
        <p>It is that pressure that President Clinton hoped to deal with in his program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton would offer families with annual incomes of up to $100,000 the right to a tax credit of up to $1,500 a year, slightly more than the average tuition at community colleges nationally, for each of the first two years of college, provided the student maintains a B average.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, families with incomes of up to $100,000 would be allowed to take a tax deduction of up to $5,000 a year at first and up to $10,000 after 1997 for postsecondary education or job training.</p>
        <p>The tax breaks would cost an estimated $36 billion over five years.</p>
        <p>But economists say there are two factors that could make such a program backfire.</p>
        <p>The first is that subsidies, whether for medical care, housing or education, typically lead to higher prices and higher income for the sellers of a product. In economic theory, at any given price, people are willing to buy a certain amount of a product. If the price rises, people will tend to buy less.</p>
        <p>But if they have more income, they tend to want more. In this case, theory suggests, colleges would be able to raise tuition somewhat and not lose buyers because the buyers would have somewhat more money.</p>
        <p>In the college market, however, a small number of top colleges already charge premium prices, with tuitions of $20,000 or more, and could probably raise prices further and still have 5 or 10 applicants for every seat. Other colleges with empty seats have been cutting tuition to try to attract more students. And many public colleges, some selective, some not, have tried to keep tuition low to encourage access.</p>
        <p>''How prices are set and what forces tuitions up is very elusive,'' said Lawrence E. Gladieux, executive director for policy analysis at the College Board. But, he said, even if colleges do not raise tuitions, they may be able to share in some of the Federal windfall by reducing the financial aid they provide. He noted that financial aid at many high-cost colleges was based on parents' income. If families are better off after the tax breaks, financial aid may be reduced somewhat.</p>
        <p>A second factor that could lead to higher tuition is that if the program succeeds in helping more students -- particularly low-income students -- go to college, colleges that are already filled to capacity will have to expand to absorb the new students. They will have to build new classrooms, dormitories and gymnasiums, add computers and hire new faculty members, and they will need money to pay for them.</p>
        <p>''The picture President Clinton paints is immensely popular and appealing,'' said Gordon C. Winston, chairman of the economics department at Williams College and co-director of the Williams Project on the Economics of Higher Education. ''But the thing I keep coming back to and fretting about is that tuition pays only a small part of the cost of college.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Education said it did not have estimates of how many more students might attend college under the President's program.</p>
        <p>But more students in college would mean that many colleges already at full capacity would need to turn to taxpayers -- and to higher tuitions -- to raise additional money. The other choice, Professor Winston said, is a reduction in quality.</p>
        <p>''For every dollar added to student tuition resources, somebody is going to have to add more money,'' he said. By his calculations, tuition covers only 11 percent of the cost of public higher education, which includes not only operating costs but also capital expenditures and interest on loans.</p>
        <p>''Tuitions will go up sharply, and everyone will scream about the rapacious institutions,'' he predicted.</p>
        <p>The Department of Education acknowledges these pressures.</p>
        <p>''Any time you put together a program that gives substantial benefits to people, you have to be concerned about whether you'll affect the market in a perverse way,'' said David A. Longanecker, an Assistant Secretary of Education. But he said the Clinton Administration was banking on ''strong economic and political reasons why that won't happen.''</p>
        <p>On the economic side, he said, the program is structured so it is not a simple across-the-board subsidy. The tax credit for up to $1,500 a year in tuition payments applies only for the first two years of college. So if a college raised tuition, students in the third and four years would have to pay more but would not have the dollar-for-dollar tax credit to ease the pain. ''Economic theory would not suggest that that would be prudent policy for the college,'' Mr. Longanecker said.</p>
        <p>And even though families would be able to take a tax deduction for tuition for any year of college, that is not a dollar-for-dollar subsidy, the way a tax credit is. The Government effectively picks up part of the tuition bill, rather than all of it. For a family in the 28 percent tax bracket, the Government would effectively pay 28 cents of every dollar, up to the limit. ''So an increase in tuition is still painful,'' Mr. Longanecker said.</p>
        <p>He added that Administration officials would be ''using the bully pulpit'' to reinforce the notion that the financial aid was meant to help people, not colleges. ''If some governors or state legislators try to capture this money to reduce their state obligations, it is not going to be very popular,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Officials at some public universities, which account for more than 80 percent of American college students, said last week that they would work to try to hold tuition down.</p>
        <p>''We are ideologically locked into keeping fees low,'' said Paul A. Elsner, chancellor of the Maricopa Community Colleges in Arizona.</p>
        <p>And Judith S. Eaton, chancellor of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, added: ''None of us likes to raise tuition. Is there a margin of ease if we know student aid will cover? Yes. But I don't believe that we as an entity sit around and say, 'Let's raise tuition because it's covered.' That is not the mind-set.''</p>
        <p>But in many states, college officials have been losing the battle to hold tuition down as state legislatures seek to cut spending.</p>
        <p>Complicating the picture is the fact that colleges are seeing their enrollments rise for other reasons. One is demographics, said Frank Levy, a professor of urban studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and co-author of ''Teaching the New Basic Skills.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy said the number of college-age students had begun to rise again after many years of decline and would continue to rise for a while. Also, he said, more people are attending college because they see it as necessary for good jobs.</p>
        <p>Frank Newman, president of the Education Commission of the States, a Denver-based nonprofit group that advises state officials on education policy, said that one way out was to look for less costly approaches to education, like classes over the Internet. He points to the decision by 10 Western states last year to set up a virtual university and efforts in other states, like California and Florida, to develop such colleges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newman, like many educators who want to broaden access to higher education, applauded the President for making education a priority.</p>
        <p>''People talk about the Republicans' pulling Clinton closer to them,'' he said. ''On education, he's pulled the Republicans over to him. He has turned this issue from a question of where to slash this further to where to put money in. That is a huge change.''</p>
