        <p>Now that the Federal Reserve has raised its short-term interest rate target, Wall Street is turning its focus again to corporate earnings.</p>
        <p>As the end of the first quarter approaches, though, small clouds are gathering around an earnings outlook that was already less than robust.</p>
        <p>The dollar, which has risen 8 percent this year against the German mark and 7 percent against the Japanese yen, has already begun to eat into the profits of American multinationals.</p>
        <p>And there are other concerns, such as pricing competition and wage pressures at home, slower economic growth in the United States and abroad, and fears that many large companies can no longer use restructuring to increase profitability.</p>
        <p>''Earnings in 1997 will probably be weaker than people expect,'' said Richard Bernstein, director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch. ''Keep in mind, we're big bulls at Merrill. But we're seeing a slowing in the growth rate of earnings.''</p>
        <p>Industry analysts at Merrill Lynch -- those who follow individual companies -- are projecting that earnings of the companies in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index will grow by about 17 percent this year. But Mr. Bernstein believes those estimates are ''overly optimistic.''</p>
        <p>Even if the downgrades are not large, some fear that falling expectations would further disrupt a stock market that has been staggering in a trading range since the Dow industrials first reached the 7,000-point level in mid-February.</p>
        <p>''There's a general malaise hanging over the market,'' said Charles Pradilla, a market strategist at Cowen &amp; Company. '' Right now stocks are overvalued relative to bonds, and the strong dollar is not benefiting anyone.''</p>
        <p>Of course, there are those, like Abby Joseph Cohen at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, who disagree with the weakening earnings scenario. Yet even Ms. Cohen concedes that slower growth in Europe could reduce her 10 percent earnings growth forecast to 7 percent.</p>
        <p>And while Byron R. Wien, the United States investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, has not revised his forecast yet, he has begun to rethink his modest earnings growth expectation of about 7 percent because of worries about the strong dollar.</p>
        <p>''It's a significant problem,'' said Mr. Wien, who has already forecast that the stock market will fall sharply later this year. ''We're going to see some impact on first-quarter earnings. The companies that will be hit are the multinationals.''</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, I.B.M. said the stronger dollar was curbing its profits and just last week Eastman Kodak said that revenue in the first two months of this year was flat compared with last year, due in part to the strong dollar. Shares of both stocks plummeted on the news.</p>
        <p>A strong dollar hurts profits two ways. It makes American exports more expensive abroad, which can reduce sales. And when those foreign sales are translated back into a stronger dollar at the end of a quarter, they are worth less.</p>
        <p>Analysts of the technology sector, which has the largest foreign exposure, have also begun to worry about currency translations and weakening demand in Europe, two factors that have helped exacerbate an already ferocious drop in technology stocks this year.</p>
        <p>In addition to the dollar, price competition -- as suggested by McDonald's recent decision to lower the price of selected items -- could also reduce earnings.</p>
        <p>And if pricing competition does not  eat up profits, strategists like Charles Clough at Merrill Lynch suggest that other factors will. Although real sales growth gained about 2 percent a year in the 1990's, he said that earnings had grown by about 16 percent a year, largely because of ''restructuring'' or downsizing. ''But our belief is that that string is running out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs contends that the gloomy predictions are overstated, partly because a new formulation is at work in corporate America.</p>
        <p>More than the strong dollar, she worries about a European economy that is in a ''funk,'' burdened by unemployment and weak domestic activity. But those problems are offset, she said, by the fact that American companies are spread across the globe, including in countries where they benefit from a favorable currency exchange.</p>
        <p>But even more important than the fact that many large companies hedge against bad times, Ms. Cohen said, is the fact that American products sold abroad often have a ''value added'' component.</p>
        <p>''If you're selling steel, chemicals or newsprint, then your customers have options,'' she said. ''But much of what we produce is value-added,'' such as Intel's pentium processor, which has few competitors in Europe and Japan.</p>
        <p>''If we were going to see a significant dollar effect, we should have seen it in the fourth quarter,'' she said. ''I think the surprise was that the dog didn't bark.''</p>
        <p>There are two ways of tracking earnings on Wall Street and both of them are slipping. ''Bottom up'' projections are based on analysts' estimates for individual companies while ''top down'' forecasts are made by strategists and economists using economic and industry figures to estimate overall earnings growth.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the ''bottom up'' and ''top down'' projections vary widely early in the year, with industry analysts more optimistic than market strategists. This year is no different. Industry analysts are projecting, on average, a 13.6 percent growth in earnings of the companies in the S.&amp; P. 500, down from 14.4 percent a month ago. Top-down equity strategists are projecting 6.6 percent, down from 6.7 percent a month ago, according to First Call, which tracks earnings projections.</p>
        <p>But as the year progresses, the two forecasts get closer, usually with the bottom-up analysts reducing their forecasts, said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call.</p>
        <p>''The critical question is not whether the industry analysts lower their numbers, but will they lower them more than normal,'' Mr. Hill said. ''But so far, no one is pushing the panic button.''</p>
