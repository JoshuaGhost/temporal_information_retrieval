        <p>Frank Rich Op-Ed column notes that Republican Rep Pete King has criticized House Speaker Newt Gingrich for being 'most powerful liberal in American politics'; contends that it is becoming as easy to mistake Republicans for McGovern Democrats as it is to mistake Democrats for Rockefeller Republicans; maintains that ideological cross-dressing, far from being passing expedience concocted by Clinton Administration for re-election campaign, has turned into bipartisan rage (M)</p>

        <p>Is it possible that when the ascendant Newt Gingrich of '94 wrapped himself in the Leninist revolutionary rhetoric of the New Left, he wasn't kidding? Two years later -- as Mr. Gingrich slinks behind Al Gore to make nice to the Chinese -- it's becoming as easy to mistake the Republicans for McGovern Democrats as it is to mistake the Democrats for Rockefeller Republicans. Ideological cross-dressing, far from being a passing expedience concocted by Dick Morris and Bill Clinton for a re-election campaign, has turned into a bipartisan rage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich is now ''the most powerful liberal in American politics,'' writes a betrayed Representative Pete King, the New York Republican, in The Weekly Standard this week, citing the Speaker's retreat from tax cuts, his embrace of the movie star Alec Baldwin and the National Endowment for the Arts, and his decision to invite Jesse Jackson as an honored guest to January's State of the Union festivities. Not to be outflanked on the left, Jesse Helms was photographed on Tuesday holding hands with Madeleine Albright and may soon reverse his obstruction of an international chemical-weapons ban. Michael Reagan, the Los Angeles talk-show host, is so disgusted by such Republican drifts away from his father's ideals and toward Socialism that last week he resigned from the G.O.P., calling it ''the Rodney King party.''</p>

        <p>Is it possible that when the ascendant Newt Gingrich of '94 wrapped himself in the Leninist revolutionary rhetoric of the New Left, he wasn't kidding? Two years later -- as Mr. Gingrich slinks behind Al Gore to make nice to the Chinese -- it's becoming as easy to mistake the Republicans for McGovern Democrats as it is to mistake the Democrats for Rockefeller Republicans. Ideological cross-dressing, far from being a passing expedience concocted by Dick Morris and Bill Clinton for a re-election campaign, has turned into a bipartisan rage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich is now ''the most powerful liberal in American politics,'' writes a betrayed Representative Pete King, the New York Republican, in The Weekly Standard this week, citing the Speaker's retreat from tax cuts, his embrace of the movie star Alec Baldwin and the National Endowment for the Arts, and his decision to invite Jesse Jackson as an honored guest to January's State of the Union festivities. Not to be outflanked on the left, Jesse Helms was photographed on Tuesday holding hands with Madeleine Albright and may soon reverse his obstruction of an international chemical-weapons ban. Michael Reagan, the Los Angeles talk-show host, is so disgusted by such Republican drifts away from his father's ideals and toward Socialism that last week he resigned from the G.O.P., calling it ''the Rodney King party.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan's dire diagnosis of creeping leftism on the right is hardly unique. In last month's Commentary, a symposium of 15 thinkers contemplating ''the future of conservatism'' was fixated on how some of their own longstanding allies, led by the theologian Richard John Neuhaus, are mimicking Abbie Hoffman with their calls for resistance to an American ''regime'' they liken to Nazi Germany. As Norman Podhoretz accurately puts it, ''the extremist hysteria of the old counterculture of the 60's'' is back, this time under a conservative banner. Right on, indeed.</p>
        <p>Nor does this infatuation with leftism end with rhetoric; policy is keeping pace. Republicans have forsaken term limits and the axing of the Department of Education to champion such Big Government intrusions as the V-chip and Internet censorship. They are hoping activist judges will reverse medical-marijuana initiatives approved by Arizona and California voters. They even want to jack up government spending. The religious right pushes for a new Federal entitlement, the $500-per-child tax credit; a senatorial ally, Dan Coats of Indiana, champions federally mandated family leave. Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council loudly defends the mother of all welfare programs, Social Security. Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition calls for a new social program, a la Bill Clinton's Americorps, to help urban blacks and Hispanics -- with a cost to taxpayers of $150 million, or $50 million more than they contribute to the N.E.A.</p>
        <p>What's next -- a Republican alliance with Louis Farrakhan? Don't laugh. The idea has been advanced energetically by Jude Wanniski, the supply-side guru who advises the uncentered Presidential prospect Jack Kemp, and seconded by the conservative columnist Robert Novak as a way of bringing black voters into the G.O.P. Mr. Farrakhan no longer regards Jews as ''bloodsuckers,'' Mr. Wanniski assures us, but instead offers what Mr. Novak praises as ''a cross between the Christian Coalition and libertarianism.''</p>
        <p>For two years now, Washington's conventional wisdom has had it that the Democrats are bereft of ideas, save those plagiarized from the Republicans, and that the party's only selling point is that it's Not Gingrich. But the Republicans, with no Evil Empire or welfare queens to kick around anymore, now seem similarly bereft of convictions (unless what Mr. Gingrich calls the ''moral imperative'' of a balanced budget counts as such). So they sign on to popular Democratic initiatives and sell themselves as Not Clinton.</p>
        <p>In truth, neither party has the big ideas or guts to tackle the most intractable issues -- inner-city meltdown, campaign and entitlement reform, China -- so they meet in the poll-driven center where inertia rules and the skies are not cloudy all day. If Barbra Streisand isn't on the bill when Mr. Gingrich holds a benefit to pay off his $300,000 ethics fine, don't assume she wasn't asked.</p>
