        <p>Warm winter, while being good for crocuses, has also been kind to flea beetle and corn borer, which could spell trouble for New Jersey farmers (New Jersey Daily Briefing) (S)</p>

        <p>The warm winter has been good for crocuses, but it has also been kind to the flea beetle and the corn borer, which could spell trouble for farmers. Both insects burrow into the soil for the winter, and if the ground does not freeze more than a few inches deep, more of them are still alive in the spring to crawl out and attack crops -- tomatoes and potatoes for the beetles, sweet corn for the borers.</p>

        <p>The warm winter has been good for crocuses, but it has also been kind to the flea beetle and the corn borer, which could spell trouble for farmers. Both insects burrow into the soil for the winter, and if the ground does not freeze more than a few inches deep, more of them are still alive in the spring to crawl out and attack crops -- tomatoes and potatoes for the beetles, sweet corn for the borers.</p>
        <p>During January's cold snap, the ground froze only four or five inches down, said Stephen Garrison, Rutgers Cooperative Extension Service agent for Cumberland and Salem Counties. That is not enough to kill the pests, he said, and it is unlikely the weather will turn cold long enough for a deeper freeze.</p>
