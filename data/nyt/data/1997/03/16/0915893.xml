        <p>When Regena Thomas arrived in New Jersey last summer, she didn't know if the Newark Mayor's last name was James or Sharpe, she couldn't have cared less where Steven A. Wynn built a tunnel, and she had no interest in eating the bagels and pizza that seemed to sustain everyone around her.</p>
        <p>''I had never done New Jersey politics,'' Ms. Thomas said in an interview last week. ''I do Southern politics. I'm a Southern girl. I want some biscuits for breakfast.'' After spending just a week in the state, the Kentucky native said, ''I wanted to leave.''</p>

        <p>When Regena Thomas arrived in New Jersey last summer, she didn't know if the Newark Mayor's last name was James or Sharpe, she couldn't have cared less where Steven A. Wynn built a tunnel, and she had no interest in eating the bagels and pizza that seemed to sustain everyone around her.</p>
        <p>''I had never done New Jersey politics,'' Ms. Thomas said in an interview last week. ''I do Southern politics. I'm a Southern girl. I want some biscuits for breakfast.'' After spending just a week in the state, the Kentucky native said, ''I wanted to leave.''</p>
        <p>But as the head of the Democratic Party's effort to reach its base vote in New Jersey, Ms. Thomas stayed on, and as a result she was credited with orchestrating the strong voter turnout among urban voters that helped push a number of Democratic candidates into office in November. ''I had no personal relationships here,'' she said. ''I had no bias in New Jersey. The most important thing for me was the base vote. I knew that after the election I was hauling my behind out of New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>But the Southern girl is back. And this time she is here to play what could be a crucial role in the gubernatorial campaign of State Senator James E. McGreevey, who is also the Mayor of Woodbridge Township. As a consultant to the McGreevey camp, Ms. Thomas is expected to help the Democratic candidate build support among black voters, who in recent statewide elections have proven to be a potent and pivotal force. In 1993, for example, strong support from black voters helped Governor Whitman win a close race, and November's exit polls showed that Senator Robert G. Torricelli's 10-point victory margin was due largely to the strong support he received from black voters. Among white voters in November, only 47 percent voted for Mr. Torricelli, compared to 48 percent who voted for his Republican opponent, Richard A. Zimmer, exit polling found. However, among black voters, Mr. Torricelli received 85 percent of the vote, compared to just 13 percent for Mr. Zimmer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas does not hesitate to remind Mr. Torricelli of the role black voters played in his election. ''Of that 10 percent margin,'' she said, ''I'm taking credit for near 8 percent.'' What it has all added up to, she asserts, is a realization among this year's field of gubernatorial candidates that when black voters are united in the state, they become a commanding force that neither party can afford to ignore. ''In this campaign, African-Americans are the focus,'' she said. ''This is not affirmative action. We can make or break the campaign.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Thomas boasts about the power that black voters possess going into this year's race the same way a boxer brags about his punch going into a prize fight. Her verbal cadence is vintage Jesse Jackson, for whom she worked, cutting her political teeth on his Presidential campaigns in the 1980's. She has also served on the staffs of Washington Mayors Sharon Pratt Kelly and Marion Barry.</p>
        <p>At age 40, and standing -- as she described it -- ''6 foot, 200 and some change,'' Ms. Thomas is as physically imposing as she is verbally caustic. If a candidate annoys her, she threatened, ''I'll snatch him.'' People who work with her ''know that I may go off,'' she said. When asked about his new consultant, Mr. McGreevey smiled a wide smile (Ms. Thomas was in the room), and said, ''She's tough.''</p>
        <p>In Essex County, where 15 to 20 percent of the state's Democratic voters live and many cities heavily populated with minorities are situated, Ms. Thomas's expertise and the relationships she built last year among local political leaders could prove especially valuable to Mr. McGreevey, who is white. Her plan, she said, is first to help distinguish Mr. McGreevey from other contenders for the Democratic nomination. Then she must pull together various factions of black political leaders and convince them that, despite any personal differences they may have, together ''they have all the power in this state and must seize it.'' That ''is what I bring to the table,'' Ms. Thomas said. ''I challenge them to be that arrogant.''</p>
        <p>Since last fall's election, Ms. Thomas said her private consulting business has been inundated with calls from candidates from around the country seeking her assistance. She said she was not getting rich as a result, but she admitted that she had been forced to bring in a couple of business partners to help with the work. She joined the McGreevey camp, she said, because she believed that he was personable and skillful at politics. However, Ms. Thomas confided that she also admires Mrs. Whitman. ''I like her style,'' she said. ''I wish she were a Democrat.''</p>
        <p>Despite the admiration, when it comes to the black voters who crossed over from the Democratic Party in 1993 to cast a vote for Mrs. Whitman, Ms. Thomas issued a warning to the Governor. ''I'm taking those crossovers back,'' she said. ''They are mine. As a matter of fact, I already took them back last November.''</p>
