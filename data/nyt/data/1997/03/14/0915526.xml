        <p>Kevin Hanley  I-20 Gallery  529 West 20th Street  Chelsea  Through April 6</p>
        <p>Kevin Hanley, a young Los Angeles artist having his first exhibition in New York City, uses technology in ways that veer effortlessly from blunt to refined. In ''Two and Four,'' a Naumanesque two-channel video piece, the projected images of two women yo-yo back and forth, as if the camera lens were zooming unsteadily in and out.</p>
        <p>One soon realizes that the subjects are actually tossing the live camera back and forth between them, recording a game of catch from the projectile's point of view. The careering, disorienting movement of space and image is wonderfully visceral and may recall an infantile thrill: that of a small child's being gently tossed back and forth between adults.</p>

        <p>Kevin Hanley  I-20 Gallery  529 West 20th Street  Chelsea  Through April 6</p>
        <p>Kevin Hanley, a young Los Angeles artist having his first exhibition in New York City, uses technology in ways that veer effortlessly from blunt to refined. In ''Two and Four,'' a Naumanesque two-channel video piece, the projected images of two women yo-yo back and forth, as if the camera lens were zooming unsteadily in and out.</p>
        <p>One soon realizes that the subjects are actually tossing the live camera back and forth between them, recording a game of catch from the projectile's point of view. The careering, disorienting movement of space and image is wonderfully visceral and may recall an infantile thrill: that of a small child's being gently tossed back and forth between adults.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanley also exhibits color photographs, usually rather glamorous and fuzzy snapshots of passers-by, framed by fields of monochrome color that echo one of the image's hues. At first resembling typical graphic design, these become more particular and personal as you look at them. Made entirely on a computer, the images and their field form an eerily seamless whole whose strangeness is intensified by the perfect color match and careful proportions of image to field.</p>
        <p>In images like ''Dutch Occupation Red'' -- a woman in blue near a red table with a white grid floor stretching away from her, all framed in red -- it is clear that abstraction is very much on Mr. Hanley's mind. The third group of works he shows are small abstractions, also made on the computer, whose fractured geometric forms suggest miniaturized paintings by Al Held. They are the weakest component in a show that nonetheless introduces an engaging, multi-talent sensibility.</p>
