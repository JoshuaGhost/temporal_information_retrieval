        <p>Federal officials are exploring whether China's concern that Congress could derail its effort to join the World Trade Organization might have motivated it to try to influence politicians here, said executives who have been questioned in the inquiry.</p>
        <p>But the American executives, who have extensive contacts in China and insisted on anonymity for fear that their business interests there could be harmed, emerged from their interviews suspecting that the investigators have found little reason to link suspect donations to the Democrats to past decisions about China policy or the promotion of specific business projects.</p>

        <p>Federal officials are exploring whether China's concern that Congress could derail its effort to join the World Trade Organization might have motivated it to try to influence politicians here, said executives who have been questioned in the inquiry.</p>
        <p>But the American executives, who have extensive contacts in China and insisted on anonymity for fear that their business interests there could be harmed, emerged from their interviews suspecting that the investigators have found little reason to link suspect donations to the Democrats to past decisions about China policy or the promotion of specific business projects.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the Federal investigators are merely searching for motives or have found specific intelligence that China sought to influence the Congressional debate over its membership in the World Trade Organization and permanent trading rights with the United States. Federal law-enforcement officials familiar with the investigation say that they are deliberately casting a wide net, and they warned against reading too much into specific questions asked during interviews.</p>
        <p>Still, current and former Clinton Administration officials familiar with China policy say it is hardly surprising that the investigation would focus on the negotiations between the United States and China over the terms by which Beijing would join the organization. Those negotiations -- which involve politically explosive issues in China, including opening its markets and phasing out huge subsidies for state-owned industries -- have picked up considerable speed in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Another China expert with close ties to the American Government, who has also been contacted by the investigators, said this week that the questions he was asked explored the possibility that China's ''real objective here was to get far more sophisticated in dealing with Congress, much the way Taiwan has.''</p>
        <p>''It's clear,'' he added, ''that the Chinese are behind the curve in lobbying Washington -- and they are flailing around to figure out how to do it.''</p>
        <p>In the past, China has largely depended on large American corporations that do extensive business in China to do its lobbying, especially in the annual debate over renewal of its most-favored-nation trading status. That status gives China the same trading rights that virtually all other trading partners enjoy. Last year, a group of American companies also began a campaign to obtain permanent favored status for China, in hopes of avoiding the yearly argument about whether China's human rights record has improved.</p>
        <p>Obtaining permanent favored status, however, would require amending a 23-year-old law, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. The law requires annual renewal of trading rights for countries that restrict emigration. That seemed possible a few months ago, but one White House official said  this week that it was ''obviously an impossibility in this environment.''</p>
        <p>Entering the World Trade Organization, however, would give China many of the benefits of permanent favored status. But China has had  reason to worry that Congress could foil its ambitions.</p>
        <p>For two years, the negotiations over the terms of China's entry into the organization have been conducted among midlevel trade officials in both countries. China's entry would lower the tariffs that more than 120 nations could impose on Chinese goods, but would also require China to open its markets to far greater foreign competition.</p>
        <p>Both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, however, have increasingly wanted a voice in that negotiation, viewing it as a chance to extract other concessions from China, on everything from human rights to arms proliferation. The United States has only one vote in the World Trade Organization, but it holds a de facto veto over China's entry.</p>
        <p>Last week, the House minority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, introduced legislation that would give Congress the right to vote on the American position on China's application, rather than leave the issue to the Administration. The White House  has not taken a position on the bill.</p>
        <p>''The Chinese are beginning to get the gospel of influence,'' said Orville Schell, a China expert who is dean of the journalism school at the University of California at Berkeley. ''They are learning from how Taiwan operates, how Japan operates. They are discovering that they cannot afford to forget about Congress. And if there is anything to all of this, it may all prove to have been a fairly amateurish effort to establish a beachhead.''</p>
        <p>If so, the investigation into China's alleged efforts may well have undermined the Chinese cause. Mr. Clinton, his aides concede, has far less room to maneuver than he did a few months ago in negotiating the terms of China's entry into the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>The Administration is clearly concerned that the inquiry into China's activities could interfere with initiatives toward Beijing that the White House hoped to make the center of its foreign policy this year.</p>
        <p>In an appearance today before the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Mr. Clinton's National Security Adviser, Samuel R. Berger, called the accusations of Chinese interference in American politics serious and said, ''Obviously if it turns out that they're true then appropriate action indeed will be taken.''</p>
        <p>But he defended the Administration policy of engagement with China, saying ''we have an extraordinarily important interest in developing a broader, deeper dialogue, strategic dialogue with China.''</p>
        <p>The way to deal with areas of ''fundamental difference'' with China, he said, ''is not to turn our backs on China. It is to sit down with China, engage with China, be clear, be frank, use the leverage that we have.''</p>
