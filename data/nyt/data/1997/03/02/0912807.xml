        <p>Comment on revelations about Pres Clinton's use of White House for sleepovers, latest excess in orgy of campaign fund-raising by both parties that just barely follows law; photos (S)</p>

        <p>IT can be argued that there was no difference between the big contributors the Republicans called Team 100 coming to an annual dinner and, a few years later, dozens of donors in their Doctor Dentons arriving as President Clinton's guests.</p>
        <p>In each case the law was obeyed, so long as the events were thank-you's for past generosity and no one was hit up for more until they left the White House grounds. Its business of fund-raising in the 1996 campaign was, the White House says, business as usual.</p>

        <p>IT can be argued that there was no difference between the big contributors the Republicans called Team 100 coming to an annual dinner and, a few years later, dozens of donors in their Doctor Dentons arriving as President Clinton's guests.</p>
        <p>In each case the law was obeyed, so long as the events were thank-you's for past generosity and no one was hit up for more until they left the White House grounds. Its business of fund-raising in the 1996 campaign was, the White House says, business as usual.</p>
        <p>But on a level of reality and reflection that the capital rarely attains, the Clinton campaign's use of the White House for coffee parties and Lincoln Bedroom sleep-overs is different. It is a difference in scale so vast that it is a difference in kind.</p>
        <p>''The people's house,'' as no less a populist than Nancy Reagan once called it, was transformed. Not, as The Washington Times put it, into a bordello, but into something more like one of those fancy anterooms the best department stores used to maintain for their top-drawer clientele to shop in peace.</p>
        <p>The White House bakers were working overtime preparing pastries while the President curtailed the policy discussions he loves in order to have coffee with contributors not quite generous enough for sleep-overs. Golf games and rides on Air Force One were other opportunities for the President to cement his new friendships with his new donors.</p>
        <p>But if the White House argument that this was nothing special -- or not as bad as someone else once did -- is foolish, so is the insistence by most Republicans here that the only issue is the moral failings of a President who beat them twice.</p>
        <p>It's the system, stupid.</p>
        <p>A more fastidious Democratic incumbent might have kept the premises freer of crass fund-raising. And a far more fastidious incumbent might have lost. At least that is what Mr. Clinton thought when he decided in 1995 that to be re-elected, he had to spend far more millions on television advertising than he could expect to raise without exploiting the White House.</p>
        <p>Nor was he unique in sailing close to the wind. With the utter breakdown of the restraints on campaign financing that followed Watergate, the continuous money chase is now an exercise in meaningless distinctions.</p>
        <p>To obey the law against raising money on Federal property, members of Congress go a block or two from their offices to party headquarters, where telephones are made available for an hour or two for shaking the money tree. Political parties (and unions and interest groups of all kinds) communicate on what they call ''issue ads'' on television. They say that candidate A has made the nation prosper, or candidate B beats his wife. But as long as they don't use words like ''vote for'' or ''defeat,'' the free-speech theology of the Supreme Court says it is O.K. Foreigners -- the Riady family of Indonesia, for example -- can give campaign contributions if they are permanent residents of the United States; otherwise, they may not.</p>
        <p>And most important of all, 90 years after the Corrupt Practices Act barred corporations from giving to campaigns for Federal office, and 25 years after Maurice Stans collected suitcases full of corporate cash for Richard Nixon's re-election effort, corporate dollars are back. Philip Morris, for example,  bought into the Republican Party for a total of $3.2 million, most of it in unregulated ''soft money'' spent in huge quantities on television ads.</p>
        <p>But in every area, from soft money to ''issue ads'' to individual fund-raising, to establishing and maintaining fund-raising clubs that promise special access to the powerful, the Republicans are more accomplished.</p>
        <p>They start with an advantage: more rich people are Republicans than Democrats. But Republicans also do better at tapping the unrich. They have worked at it longer, and they have ironed out the kinks in their operations.</p>
        <p>In contrast, President Clinton found himself the first Democratic incumbent since the rise of soft money. Jimmy Carter, after all, was President back when the post-Watergate reforms really worked, and he and Ronald Reagan both ran in the general election with only the $29.4 million they got from the Treasury.</p>
        <p>So the Clinton campaign used the most valuable resources: the President and his residence. Of course those symbols are no longer revered as they were in 1908, when Gideon Willets wrote in ''Inside History of the White House'': ''In the breast of the patriotic American the love of these three things is dominant: Love for the flag that protects him; love for the Chief Magistrate whose duty it is to keep that flag aloft; love for the building, the White House, that shelters the President of all the People.''</p>
        <p>Even so, there remains an aura about the White House, a thrill for first-time visitors that was marketable. State dinner guest lists have always included fat cats. More urgently, President Ford invited uncommitted delegates to the White House (and to the flight deck of the carrier Forrestal to watch the tall ships in New York Harbor for the Bicentennial) as he struggled to defeat Mr. Reagan for the 1976 nomination.</p>
        <p>And all of the Clinton devices are basically systematized versions of the access that almost all fund-raisers admit they sell in exchange for contributions. If Mr. Bush and Mr. Reagan were less energetic, Republicans on Capitol Hill have never shirked. With the G.O.P. takeover of Congress in 1995, they attracted all the donors they could find who wanted the ear of the new cast of Congressional leaders and committee and subcommittee chairmen. There is not much difference between what the ''President's Club'' of the Johnson Administration or the Congressional Forum of the Republican House majority promised: access to movers and shakers.</p>
        <p>The clumsiness measured in illegal foreign contributions or invitations to arms merchants or penny-stock smugglers may be the equivalent of the problems any company may face in a sudden expansion. With years of practice comparable to the G.O.P.'s, the Democrats could run a smoother operation.</p>
        <p>And even if there is a touch of chutzpah in Mr. Clinton using his own mistakes as an argument for new campaign-finance legislation, it is hardly more far-fetched than the Senate Republicans who seem willing to abandon a juicy investigation of his sins because they fear it might lead to public outcry to do something about the soft money system they all live by.</p>
        <p>Now there is no outcry. The public seems convinced that all politicians are for sale, or at least for rent, and the details bore people. The public seems to understand the basic truth of campaign finance:</p>
        <p>The real scandal is not how the law is broken; the scandal is what's legal.</p>
