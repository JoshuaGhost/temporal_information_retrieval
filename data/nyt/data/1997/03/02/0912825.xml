        <p>AMERICANS can be forgiven if they don't understand the rise and fall of Wall Street, but what happens when the price gyrations of household electronics become too tricky?</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, Lisa Drake, a bookkeeper in Chapel Hill, N.C., thought she had found a good deal on a satellite dish from an on-line computer retailer, until the invoice arrived in the mail. The store's shipping and finance charges had raised the dish's price some 20 percent.</p>

        <p>AMERICANS can be forgiven if they don't understand the rise and fall of Wall Street, but what happens when the price gyrations of household electronics become too tricky?</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, Lisa Drake, a bookkeeper in Chapel Hill, N.C., thought she had found a good deal on a satellite dish from an on-line computer retailer, until the invoice arrived in the mail. The store's shipping and finance charges had raised the dish's price some 20 percent.</p>
        <p>''I was more than a little surprised by what that dish really cost me,'' she said. ''It's hard enough to know what's a deal today and what's not without all these tricks with service and finance charges. How do you know what you're really paying?''</p>
        <p>Price confusion -- the inability to figure out who's offering the best bargain, or even to know the true cost of something after you've bought it -- has seldom seemed so universal. The traditional laws of supply and demand once imposed a semblance of order and clarity on prices, but today they are being so haphazardly amended by pell-mell technological changes and new marketing wrinkles that the American marketplace now offers all the certainty of a Mideast bazaar -- maybe less.</p>
        <p>Look at McDonald's. Last week it announced price cuts likely to leave you suspicious over whether a 55-cent Big Mac is really a 55-cent Big Mac if the fries and drink you have to buy with it leave you a total of three and a half bucks light. Airlines, hotels and rental car companies are even more mystifying on prices: they often change them several times a day. And after years of charging lofty rates, long-distance phone companies now write checks to lure customers away from their competitors. In recognition of the confusion over rates, ads for AT&amp;T now feature the actor Paul Reiser pitching a no-gimmicks, fixed rate -- but even the ads' other characters have a hard time believing him.</p>
        <p>Technology and Gimmickry</p>
        <p>How did buying -- the core act of the free market -- become such a conundrum? There are plenty of reasons. Not only are technological advances fueling obsolescence or price volatility; they are also allowing airlines and other businesses to better monitor consumer demand so they can change prices at a moment's notice. Government deregulation has spurred price competition in many businesses. And computers, with their potential for on-line buying, may speed the decline of the cash economy and make transactions even more intangible.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Americans' stubbornly robust spending habits have created a competitive hurly-burly of marketing innovations and outright gimmickry: credit card companies offer a bewildering range of interest rates, fees and octopus-like tie-ins to other products and services, which further blurs the prices of goods bought on credit.</p>
        <p>Outlet malls, mail-order catalogues, corporate discount plans and TV direct-marketing schemes have assaulted retail markets by offering goods at reduced or ''wholesale'' prices -- whatever that means. Posh department stores, where sales were once rare, trumpet them almost daily. And sales taxes, which vary from state to state by as much as 7 percentage points, only add to the confusion.</p>
        <p>Consumers and mass marketers share the blame for the Big Price Fog. Persuaded by mass marketing that this land of seemingly limitless choices offers a better deal just around the corner, customers (who have long been told they are always right) have become ever more demanding and fickle. The marketing meisters respond with sales, coupons and discounts, you name it -- inspiring even greater confusion and expectations that perpetuate a never-ending cycle.</p>
        <p>Economists and politicians fret that much of this price flux eludes the Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation and regulates annual adjustments to a third of Federal spending, including Social Security benefits. And if, as they suspect, the C.P.I. has been exaggerated, Americans have been paying too much in taxes -- meaning that the cost of price confusion affects pretty much everyone, even if you don't buy anything.</p>
        <p>Rebate, Rebate</p>
        <p>In fact, though, consumers evidently see little alternative but to play by the ever-shifting rules of the American bazaar. As consistently high levels of credit card debt suggest, vast numbers of Americans eschew cash purchases nowadays for fear of missing out on the sundry perks of plastic. Why pay cash, which offers no discounts or freebies (unless you and the seller are conspiring to avoid sales taxes), when a credit card purchase puts you one step closer to a round-trip ticket to Tahiti?</p>
        <p>But life is seldom so simple. Some deals have become so complex that even a Harvard M.B.A. would struggle to find the true price. Often this allows merchandisers to charge what they want and pocket a substantial profit, with the poor consumer none the wiser. The granddaddy of them all: car leases, which contain as many baffling caveats as a bank merger.</p>
        <p>''Friends of mine ask me questions about their leases and I'm amazed about how clueless people are about them,'' said Edward Harting, managing editor of Automotive Lease Guide in Santa Barbara, Calif. ''Leases have gotten simpler, but I have a buddy who's a lawyer, and even he gets confused when he reads them.''</p>
        <p>One New York car dealer recently advertised a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo for $295 per month with no down payment. Anyone who rushed to the dealership was in for a $1,285 shock. In the fine print, this 36-month, nothing-down lease required the first month's payment, a $395 security deposit and a $595 bank fee.</p>
        <p>Miffed by such shenanigans? Then try to figure the price of a credit card that offers a rebate or discount -- or the true price of anything bought with it.</p>
        <p>Once limited to frequent-flier miles, rebates now include everything from gasoline to cash, making them virtually impossible to price. One of the most popular is Citibank's American Airlines AAdvantage card, which awards one frequent-flier mile for every dollar charged. While this card is enormously popular, it comes with a few downsides. A consumer has to decide how much he is willing to pay in fees and interest before he finally charges $7,000, the minimum total required to get any reward from the card.</p>
        <p>Befuddled</p>
        <p>Card holders who don't pay off their balances could owe a bundle. On top of 17.65 percent interest, the card carries a $50 annual fee, more than twice the national average, according to BanxQuote Inc., an interest rate tracking company in Fairfield, N.J.</p>
        <p>''The rebate cards all depend on life style,'' said Robert McKinley, president of RAM Research, a credit card tracking company in Frederick, Md. ''Frequent fliers may pay extra for miles, but drivers may want the cards that provide gas rebates. The banks do these cards because they don't want to compete on price.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, and across the marketplace, many retailers of goods and services appear to have concluded that in an economy heavily dependent on sales and discounts to maintain demand, a bedazzled, befuddled consumer is the best kind of customer. That sort of attitude inspires resentment, and an appetite for getting even.</p>
        <p>Bill Rubin, a manager with I.B.M. in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., recently got a deal on a lawn mower at his local Sears -- paying $225, or $155 below the list price.</p>
        <p>''I pointed out to the salesmen that they couldn't keep that mower there until the spring,'' Mr. Rubin said. ''I said I'd take it that day if they gave me a discount. It worked. The stores want to play games with their prices; it's nice to come out on top every once in a while.''</p>
