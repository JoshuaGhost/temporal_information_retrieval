        <p>The Walt Disney Company has agreed to add services to enable visitors with impaired hearing to better enjoy the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Disney M-G-M Studios theme parks in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.</p>
        <p>The agreement was reached with the Justice Department, which enforces the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and which approached Disney after receiving complaints. It specifies that sign-language interpreters will be provided on a regular schedule and captioning systems will be installed in attractions where feasible. More than 100 performances, parades and some rides will be affected by the agreement.</p>

        <p>The Walt Disney Company has agreed to add services to enable visitors with impaired hearing to better enjoy the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and Disney M-G-M Studios theme parks in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.</p>
        <p>The agreement was reached with the Justice Department, which enforces the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and which approached Disney after receiving complaints. It specifies that sign-language interpreters will be provided on a regular schedule and captioning systems will be installed in attractions where feasible. More than 100 performances, parades and some rides will be affected by the agreement.</p>
        <p>A Disney spokesman, Bill Warren, said the project was in preparation for longer than two years before the agreement was announced in January. Some of the interpreters, captioning systems and devices to increase volume are already in place. The additions at Disneyland are scheduled to be complete by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>''Rear window captioning,'' a system developed in Boston that is used in some IMAX theaters, has been installed by Disney. The captions are projected from the rear of the auditorium onto Plexiglas panels to be adjusted by the viewer so the captions appear superimposed on the movie screen.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warren said that Disney had for some time been providing written scripts on request for most of its attractions. On rides like Space Ship Earth, hearing-impaired guests can ride again promptly.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, announced Jan. 17 by Deval L. Patrick, then assistant Attorney General for civil rights, Disney will continue to pursue technologies to make more attractions enjoyable for the hearing impaired.</p>
