        <p>WITH years of economic growth and restructuring under their belts, many  companies are sitting on mountains of cash. In the auto industry, for instance, Ford and Chrysler have reserves of $15.4 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. And the $17 billion General Motors had in its pocket at the start of 1997 is $6.8 billion more than it had 12 months earlier. That means G.M. was socking away about $19 million a day in 1996 -- nearly $1 million an hour.</p>

        <p>WITH years of economic growth and restructuring under their belts, many  companies are sitting on mountains of cash. In the auto industry, for instance, Ford and Chrysler have reserves of $15.4 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively. And the $17 billion General Motors had in its pocket at the start of 1997 is $6.8 billion more than it had 12 months earlier. That means G.M. was socking away about $19 million a day in 1996 -- nearly $1 million an hour.</p>
        <p>Such growing piles of dollars have sparked a debate over their import. Many investors dislike such hoards; companies are businesses, after all, not banks, they say. But many others welcome the development, particularly in a highflying market. Not only is the cash a potential cushion if stock prices fall, they say, but it can also make a stock seem more expensive than it actually is, and thus perhaps hide some attractively priced investments.</p>
        <p>To identify companies that are particularly cash-heavy, The New York Times asked Compustat, a part of Standard &amp; Poor's, to screen the approximately 430 nonfinancial corporations in the S.&amp; P. 500. Specifically, Compustat subtracted long-and short-term debt from the cash and cash equivalents of these companies, and then ranked them by the percentage of their share price that is backed by this net cash. This measure, calculated at Wednesday's close, can give investors a good sense of the cash underlying their holdings.</p>
        <p>Often, companies that are high on the list have relatively limited needs for capital. For example, there are King World Productions, which syndicates ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and other television programs; Novell, the computer software company, and Biomet, which develops and markets medical devices. These corporations do spend money on talented people and research, but they are spared the big, recurring expenses encountered by heavy industries. Indeed, of the 40 screened companies with the least cash as a portion of share prices, about a dozen are in those prototypical heavy industries, utilities and steel.</p>
        <p>Some companies score high simply because they are doing extremely well and their product cycles are peaking. Compaq Computer, for example, ''may be getting so much money from its successful operations that it is having difficulty putting that money back to work,''  said James Solloway, the director of research at Argus Research.</p>
        <p>FOR investors, these cash hoards can mean stock buybacks, higher dividends and other immediate benefits. But cash-watchers also look for other possibilities.</p>
        <p>For example, Neil Hokanson, president of Hokanson Financial Management in Encinitas, Calif., wonders if Biomet's $139.5 million in cash -- 8 percent of its Wednesday stock price -- means that the company is getting ready for an acquisition.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Martin Whitman, portfolio manager of the Third Avenue Value fund, sees the $789 million war chest of Applied Materials as a sign that it can continue to expand research and to acquire more ventures like Opal Inc. and Orbot Instruments, which the company recently bought for a total of $285 million. These moves would help Applied Materials stay in the forefront in the manufacture of semiconductor production equipment, Mr. Whitman said.</p>
        <p>Having lots of cash also confers a flexibility that can be of great help in industries like computers, where competition can push prices lower,  said Jack Church, the portfolio manager of the Glenmede Equity fund. ''The average life cycle of the equipment is short, and they need to have the ability to cut prices,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a cash-heavy balance sheet often means an undervalued stock, in part because investors often do not analyze the potential uses of cash. Investors tend to judge companies based on their expected earnings -- and the 3 percent or so that cash earns after taxes is not impressive to them.</p>
        <p>''People often ignore the fact that cash is an asset that can be redeployed in an efficient way,'' said Will Browne, a portfolio co-manager of Tweedy Browne's American and Global funds.</p>
        <p>Indeed, cash-rich companies appeal to ''value'' investors, who are particularly fond of bargain-priced equities. And it is easy to see why. King World, which leads the list, has a share price that is 36 percent backed by cash. If that money is subtracted from the share price -- after all, a dollar of cash should fetch a dollar in the market, no more, no less -- the stock may be far cheaper than it appears. At its Wednesday close of $38, for example, King World stock was trading at 10.12 times its current earnings. But without the cash, the stock was selling for $24.32 a share. That's just 6.5 times earnings.</p>
        <p>Value investors, who are risk-averse as well, also like cash-rich  companies because cash can be insurance against troubled times.</p>
        <p>Consider the Boeing Company, which has $3.2 billion in cash. ''Boeing can get a lot of large orders, and then there could be a long time when they are getting much less cash flow,'' said Mr. Church, who follows a value strategy. ''So it is really important that they have that cash to see them through.''</p>
        <p>EVEN the technology companies that are high on the list are wise to have cash on hand, given the cyclical nature of their products. ''Compaq is in such a competitive, cyclical business,'' said Mr. Whitman, another value investor. ''Five or six years ago they were in deep trouble and their large cash position saved them. Cash just gives them staying power in a future that no one can predict.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Whitman, a fat wallet is important whatever the industry. ''We don't invest in common stocks unless they have superb balance sheets,'' he said. ''We want a big margin of safety, because if something goes wrong, the business will have staying power.''</p>
        <p>A solid cash position could also support a stock's price in a down market.</p>
        <p>''It gets back to the old issue of greed and fear,'' Mr. Church said.  ''Because the economy and the market are doing well, we are in the greed part of the cycle. So people are not thinking about cash as a defense, but about how much better the company could be doing if all the cash were invested. Cash would be more highly valued in a down economy or a down market.''</p>
        <p>For example, knowing that 36 percent of King World's share price is backed by actual dollars can be comforting -- particularly when that percentage is almost four times as high as that of Bay Networks, the company ranked 10th.</p>
        <p>BUT not all investors smile at the sight of plenty of cash in corporate coffers. Companies should be seizing business opportunities with their cash, not simply parking the money, they say.</p>
        <p>''There is relatively little excuse for sitting around with idle cash on the balance sheet,'' said David Beim, a finance professor at the Columbia Business School. ''Anything above 1 percent of annual sales is excess. Anything above 2 percent is really suspect. There are few businesses that need more than that.''</p>
        <p>By that kind of measurement, Microsoft's $9.16 billion in cash -- it is 17th on the list -- represents about 97 percent of yearly revenue. And Novell's $1.02 billion equals about 75 percent.</p>
        <p>A big amount of cash ''is almost a contrary indicator to us,'' Mr. Hokanson said, citing Novell as well as Apple, which has $677 million in cash, as examples of companies that are not effectively redeploying capital.  ''Unless there is a pending acquisition,'' he said, ''we begin to wonder what management is up to.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, having a lot of cash may not even guarantee that a company will be a safe investment. If Oprah Winfrey decided not to renew her contract, for example, King World stock could plummet overnight, despite its large cash backing. And with Apple's many troubles sending its stock from about $35 at the start of last year to $17.125 at Wednesday's close, few investors will see much safety in its cash. Indeed, its $677 million in cash looks almost slim when Apple's shrinking sales are taken into account. During the year ended September 1995, for example, the company had $11.06 billion in sales. But the next year, sales were just $9.83 billion.</p>
        <p>Still, many people still swear by cash, especially for its insurance value. To call a high cash position poor management, Mr. Whitman said, ''is roughly the equivalent of saying you wasted your money on fire insurance last year because your house never burned down.''</p>
