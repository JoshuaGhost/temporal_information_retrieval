      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Speaker Newt Gingrich's position is at once unusually shaky and quite secure.</p>
        <p>It is tenuous because his Republican majority in the House of Representatives is so small, because some of the dogmatic young conservatives whose elections he engineered have turned against him and because he is so unpopular with the public.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gingrich is also on solid ground because the vast majority of Republicans in the House remain loyal to him, because no one with clout seems to be prepared to push him over the edge and because there is no obvious candidate to replace him as Speaker.</p>
        <p>Some Republicans worry that Mr. Gingrich is more concerned about improving his own popularity rating than he is about advancing conservative principles, said Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of upstate New York, the chairman of the Rules Committee and a strong Gingrich supporter.</p>
        <p>Many of the Speaker's friends wish he would weigh his words more carefully before he speaks, Mr. Solomon said.</p>
        <p>''But there's no question, no question whatsoever,'' Mr. Solomon continued in an interview, ''that Gingrich's position is secure and that he can be Speaker for as long as he likes.''</p>
        <p>All this burst into the open last week. As Mr. Gingrich walked off the floor of the House Monday evening, he was buttonholed by a few reporters who asked him about the outlook for budget negotiations with the White House.</p>
        <p>According to The Associated Press, the Speaker responded that balancing the budget was a ''moral imperative'' that should take priority over cutting taxes.</p>
        <p>''So let's take tax cuts away for a moment,'' he was quoted as saying. ''Let's just talk about balancing the budget.''</p>
        <p>In some conservative circles, this amounted to heresy. Balancing the budget has long been an important part of Republican doctrine. But it has never been so central as lowering taxes.</p>
        <p>Perhaps worse, other Republican leaders in Congress were blindsided by Mr. Gingrich's comments. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, who holds the No. 2 position in the House Republican leadership, said icily the next day that policy matters of this importance ''should be discussed in closed leadership meetings.''</p>
        <p>Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Finance Committee, insisted that no budget would ever be adopted without a tax cut.</p>
        <p>Representative David M. McIntosh of Indiana, the liaison between the Republican backbenchers elected for the first time in 1994 and the party's leaders in the House, said, ''It's one thing to give the leadership wide berth to develop a strategy for a budget agreement, but it's something else entirely when the leadership's chief strategy is to capitulate on a fundamental Republican principle.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McIntosh rounded up more than two dozen of his fellow Republican representatives to sign a statement pledging to block any budget deal that did not include tax reduction.</p>
        <p>In an effort to placate his troops, Mr. Gingrich called at least two meetings of all Republicans in the House. He explained that he had been misunderstood by the reporters and that all he really meant to say was that the wisest strategy might be to get spending cuts enacted and then turn to tax reductions. That, he said, would diminish the most productive (though, of course, untruthful in his view) Democratic debating point: that Republicans want to save money in Medicare so they can give tax cuts to the wealthy.</p>
        <p>Finally, on Friday afternoon, after the last vote had been cast and the House was preparing to adjourn for a two-week recess, Mr. Gingrich went to the well of the House to say publicly what he had been saying privately in the Republican conferences.</p>
        <p>''I am deeply committed to lowering taxes,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>In other circumstances, this might be seen as just another twist in the annual budget dance, in which all sides make statements for tactical reasons that they do not necessarily believe and later back away from. But many Republicans have become tired of Mr. Gingrich's habit of saying things that he later regrets and has to explain away.</p>
        <p>They recalled, for instance, his complaint about being forced to sit in the back of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton, his comment in 1995 seeming to suggest that Medicare would ultimately ''wither on the vine'' and his fiery speech in Georgia in January, the weekend after he had been reprimanded by the House for ethics violations and assessed a penalty of $300,000, in which he was unrepentant and blamed others for his difficulties.</p>
        <p>A veteran Republican Congressman said that a lesson he had learned long ago apparently escaped Mr. Gingrich: ''You must never make news unintentionally.''</p>
        <p>Rich Galen, who was once Mr. Gingrich's spokesman and is now communications director of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said that his former boss occasionally failed to recognize that as Speaker, he could not act the way  he did when he was a firebrand in the minority trying to get recognition.</p>
        <p>''When you are a backbencher, you have to shout to be heard,'' Mr. Galen said. ''But when you are a leader, you speak into a microphone, and shouting distorts what you're saying.''</p>
        <p>Republicans also complained about votes in the House this year that ran counter to the Republican agenda: to reject a constitutional amendment imposing term limits, to reimpose a tax on airline tickets and to approve foreign aid for family planning. And they criticized Mr. Gingrich for seeming to back down from his promise to abolish the National Endowment for the Arts.</p>
        <p>''When people go home, our Republican base is saying, 'What are you doing?' '' Mr. McIntosh said in an interview. ''That's not what we sent a Republican Congress there to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich's embarrassment deepened on Thursday when 11 maverick Republicans joined all the Democrats in the House to reject a Republican resolution providing money for House committees, on a 213-to-210 vote.</p>
        <p>The Democrats voted in a bloc against the financing measure because it included money for an investigation of White House and Democratic Party campaign fund-raising. The small group of Republicans voted against it for an entirely different reason: to protest an increase in money for other committees, which these Republicans characterized as an expansion of bureaucracy.</p>
        <p>As the vote tally mounted and it became apparent that he would lose, Mr. Gingrich stood in the well of the House with an ashen look.</p>
        <p>At a strategy session that night, he was able to rewrite the resolution in a way that satisfied the dissident Republicans, and the measure was adopted on Friday. But the incident underscored how the Republican majority is so narrow that a few defections can wreak havoc.</p>
        <p>There are 227 Republicans in the House, 205 Democrats, 1 independent who almost always votes with the Democrats and 2 vacancies. It is the smallest majority for either party in the House since the 83d Congress of 1953-54.</p>
        <p>At the week's end, Representative Peter T. King, a third-term Republican of Nassau, became the first lawmaker to call publicly for the Speaker to step down. In an article in the March 31 issue of the Weekly Standard, on sale this week, Mr. King wrote that Mr. Gingrich had become a liability to the party because his public approval rating was ''a few points shy of the Ebola virus.''</p>
        <p>A Washington Post/ABC News poll this month found that 61 percent of the public disapproved of the way the Speaker was handling his job, compared with only 33 percent who approved.</p>
        <p>But if the week's events illustrated Mr. Gingrich's weakness, they also underscored his strengths.</p>
        <p>One Republican after another who was nabbed in the hallways of the Capitol proclaimed utter fealty to the Speaker, a man they credit with bringing them to the promised land after 40 years in the wilderness, and who raised millions of dollars for his colleagues' campaigns last year.</p>
        <p>''He's totally involved,'' said Representative David L. Hobson, Republican of Ohio. ''He's the one everyone goes to when they have a problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich also proved again his considerable power of persuasion. After the Speaker addressed a meeting of all Republicans on Wednesday morning, a staff assistant to a senior Congressman observed, ''They came in here loaded for bear and ready to hand Newt his head, and they walked out totally intrigued with his ideas.''</p>
        <p>Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, said admiringly, ''Newt's style is not to twist arms but to persuade you.''</p>
        <p>Because politicians thrive on playing king of the mountain, it is no surprise that several senior Republicans can see themselves replacing Mr. Gingrich eventually.</p>
        <p>Among those who are said to feel this way are Mr. Armey, the majority leader; Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican whip; John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and perhaps even Mr. Solomon.</p>
        <p>But without exception, the lawmakers who were interviewed this week agreed that no coalitions were forming behind any of these men.</p>
        <p>The dominant view among Republicans, in fact, appeared not to be that of Mr. McIntosh or Mr. King but of Representative Anne M. Northup of Kentucky, a former teacher and state legislator who began her first term in Congress in January.</p>
        <p>''I admire him enormously,'' Ms. Northup said. ''Does that mean I agree with every thing he says? Of course not. But I respect his grasp of issues and tactics and the way he doesn't cling to positions and listens to what people say and is educable.</p>
        <p>''There are some who disagree with me, but my opinion of Newt Gingrich is that the interest of the members in having him as their leader is well founded.''</p>
