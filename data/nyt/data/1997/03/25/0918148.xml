        <p>Where only a year ago workers scurried to prepare a stadium for the 1996 Olympic Games, today a baseball grounds crew was rushing to finish the new home park of the Atlanta Braves, Turner Field.</p>
        <p>With the Braves scheduled to play two exhibition games this weekend against the Yankees -- reprising last year's World Series matchup -- workers were completing the underpinnings of home plate and the batters' boxes.</p>
        <p>The natural grass sod, laid in the last two weeks, was green and firm, and Braves officials pronounced the park ready to go.</p>
        <p>''We could play a game here this afternoon, if we had to,'' the Braves' president, Stan Kasten, said to the reporters invited to inspect the new stadium.</p>
        <p>Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, scene of Henry Aaron's 715th home run as well as the Braves' 1995 World Series victory, loomed just across the street from the new stadium. The old stadium is scheduled to be demolished and turned into a parking lot later this year.</p>
        <p>Turner Field, named for the Braves' owner, Ted Turner, began life as the main Olympic stadium in 1996, site of the opening and closing ceremonies and the track and field competition.</p>
        <p>But from the beginning, the facility had been designed to be converted into a major league baseball park and home of the Braves.</p>
        <p>The time available for conversion from its final use as an 80,000-seat track and field facility -- for the Paralympic Games late last August -- to a 49,714-seat baseball park this weekend had always been viewed as a tight squeeze.</p>
        <p>''We paid a real premium to accelerate the construction and finish in April rather than July,'' said Janet Mariet Smith, who oversees the stadium construction for Turner Broadcasting.</p>
        <p>There is reason to believe the new park will be even more hitter-friendly than Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, which was dubbed the Launching Pad because of the number of home runs slapped out of the park.</p>
        <p>While the field dimensions are similar, the new park is slightly asymmetrical.</p>
        <p>It will be 330 feet from home plate to the right-field foul pole, 335 feet from home to the left-field foul pole, 390 feet to the fence in the right-field power alley, 380 feet in left-center and 401 feet to straightaway center field.</p>
        <p>The significant difference will be in foul territory.</p>
        <p>Where the old stadium had a roomy 100 feet from either foul line to the dugouts, the new park has a tight 45 feet of foul territory down each side.</p>
        <p>With more foul balls reaching the seats, Braves officials acknowledged that hitters will get a few extra swings this year and that runs-per-game averages will probably increase.</p>
