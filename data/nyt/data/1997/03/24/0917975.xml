        <p>The comparisons with teams from North Carolina's past began more than two months ago, but they were not comparisons that these Tar Heels wanted to hear. They had a 0-3 record in the Atlantic Coast Conference, an unprecedented deficit in the 36-season Dean Smith era. They lost a 22-point second-half lead against Maryland in an unimaginable home-court collapse.</p>
        <p>Now, they can earn a chance to play for a national championship.</p>
        <p>North Carolina extended its reversal of what had nearly been a lost season with a 97-74 victory over Louisville this afternoon in the East Regional championship game. The Tar Heels (28-6) will meet Arizona on Saturday night in a national semifinal game at Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>With their 16th consecutive victory, the Tar Heels earned the school's 13th trip to the Final Four, the 11th under Smith, and the fourth -- and least expected -- of this decade.</p>
        <p>They did it by executing a well-conceived exploitation of Louisville's limitations in height and shooting ability, and by enduring a second-half Cardinal charge that reduced a 21-point lead to just 3 points with 8 minutes 20 seconds to go. And the Tar Heels did it in a style that has developed over the last several weeks: flawlessness interspersed with anxiety attacks.</p>
        <p>When their lead was down to 3 points, and the crowd of 30,230 in the Carrier Dome was roaring at the possibility of an upset, the Tar Heels sent the turbulent start of their season deeper into the past. On the Carolina bench, Ed Cota, the freshman point guard from Brooklyn, heard Makhtar Ndiaye bring up that Maryland loss.</p>
        <p>''I told him, 'Don't even bring that game up,' '' Cota said, and then the Tar Heels demonstrated how the team that broke down in January has been transformed.</p>
        <p>They scored on 8 of their next 10 possessions on the way to a 22-3 run. Six Tar Heels scored in double figures, led by Shammond Williams, who had 22 points with 6 assists and was voted most outstanding player of the regional tournament. Vince Carter scored 18 points, made 6 of 10 shots and had 7 rebounds, 5 assists and 2 steals. Antawn Jamison scored 15 points with 6 rebounds. Cota and Serge Zwikker each scored 13 points.</p>
        <p>After a 3-point shot by B. J. Flynn, who scored 12 points, cut the Tar Heel lead to 69-66, Carolina held Louisville without a score on 11 of the 12 Cardinal possessions.</p>
        <p>By that time, the Cardinals, who had used the same five starters all season, were forced to deal with too many basic changes.</p>
        <p>DeJuan Wheat, the Louisville senior point guard, had been unable to walk on Saturday because of a sprained left ankle. He said he slept for just four hours Saturday night because of treatments that lasted past 1 A.M. and resumed before 6. The lack of a backup point guard forced the Cardinals to rely on Wheat, who could be only a perimeter presence, unable to slice through the Carolina zone.</p>
        <p>But Wheat's condition worsened when the painkilling drugs that had been injected into his ankle for the second time in as many days were no longer effective. Wheat -- Louisville's second-leading career scorer, making a school-record 136th consecutive start -- was reduced to an ineffective jump shooter. He made 2 of 11 shots, all taken from beyond the 3-point line, and scored 6 points to complete his career with 2,183.</p>
        <p>''You need two feet to shoot the ball,'' Wheat said.</p>
        <p>''We just played so hard for such a long period of time,'' said Denny Crum, the Louisville coach, whose teams had a 6-0 record in regional championship games before today. ''Without DeJuan to hit those 3-pointers he normally makes, we just ran out of gas.''</p>
        <p>Louisville, forced to compensate for its height disadvantage by sending extra players to the backboards, found itself chasing Tar Heels when the shots stopped falling.</p>
        <p>''Once we got the rebound and started the break,'' Cota said, ''it seemed like they were getting tired. We got easy baskets.''</p>
        <p>Just when a crisis seemed to be taking shape for North Carolina, the Cardinals were going home and Wheat was talking quietly about disappointment. ''I think the main reason is it leads to a lot of what-if's,'' Wheat said. ''It's hard to go out like that, but that's life.''</p>
        <p>Crum was asked if he had ever had an injury as costly as Wheat's take place at as bad a time. ''If I have,'' Crum said, ''I don't remember it.''</p>
        <p>Nearly two and a half months after Tar Heel players were heard shouting at each other in the shower after a loss at Virginia, they were wearing their brand new Final Four T-shirts and hats, and rolling on the court and cutting down nets.</p>
        <p>''To get back to the Final Four, especially after how we started, nobody could really have seen this happening,'' said Charlie McNairy, a Carolina senior. ''This is a tight-knit group, from the best player to the last player on the bench. Our whole family is going to the Final Four.''</p>
