        <p>The economic boom from high technology that has led this area to start calling itself Wireless Valley will soon be hard to miss. The San Diego City Council recently accepted $18 million from Qualcomm Inc., the scrappy telecommunications company that is shaking up the cellular industry, to rename a sports arena Qualcomm Stadium.</p>
        <p>If it appears that San Diego is borrowing a page from its northern neighbor, Silicon Valley, where the computer networking giant 3Com Corporation not long ago purchased the right to rename Candlestick Park, the resemblance does not end there.</p>
        <p>From its roots as a military town, San Diego has been transformed in just half a decade into a vital entrepreneurial center spawning garage start-ups and attracting giant multinationals doing research, marketing and manufacturing.</p>
        <p>A drive through the Sorrento Valley north of downtown San Diego shows Silicon Valley-like clusters of sprawling, low-slung, hyper-modern factories bracketed between the Pacific Ocean and the rolling desert foothills, and glinting in California sunshine.</p>
        <p>Employment in telecommunications in the region jumped 65 percent in 1996 from the previous year, to 19,075. The two largest employers in the San Diego area are Qualcomm and Sony Electronics Inc. -- both wireless equipment makers -- with 7,500 and 4,000 workers, respectively.</p>
        <p>The wireless industry is on the same growth curve that has marked other high-technology consumer industries like personal computers. Wireless operators are expected to increase their annual investment by 20 percent a year, from $29 billion last year to $86 billion in 2002.</p>
        <p>As with any boom there are still reasons for caution. For example, in recent months Qualcomm has become embroiled in intellectual property lawsuits with two of its toughest competitors, Motorola Inc. and Ericsson Inc., over the wireless standard the San Diego company pioneered.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the multibillion- dollar industry investment in spectrum licenses could still be a bust. Few think it will be, however. Currently, wireless penetration in the United States is estimated to be 16 percent and, according to the market research firm Paul Kagan Associates Inc., it is expected to be approximately 48 percent by 2006.</p>
        <p>The development of the industry here highlights the way the geography of the information revolution differs from that of the industrial revolution. For information-based industries, labor is the most important natural resource.</p>
        <p>Companies like Qualcomm, PCSI and Nokia Mobile Phones are clustering around San Diego because of engineering talent left over from the declining military industry and the proximity to the University of California at San Diego as a source of skilled workers.</p>
        <p>''We're best known for biotechnology, but now telecommunications is growing faster,'' said William W. Otterson, a former I.B.M. executive who directs U.C.S.D. Connect, a program intended to transfer technology from the university into the private economy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Otterson warns that one possible factor could hold back growth: a serious shortage of trained engineers plagues the region.</p>
        <p>Producing new engineers and keeping trained ones around was the focus of Richard Atkinson in the 1980's, when he was chancellor of the university campus. Like Stanford's former provost, Frederick Terman, who in the 1930's helped incubate the local electronics industry so that Stanford graduates could stay in the area, Mr. Atkinson in the 1980's built university-industry linkages in biotechnology and telecommunications. (He is now chancellor of the University of California system.)</p>
        <p>In addition to the research activity at the university, Japanese, Korean and Finnish companies like Sony, Uniden, LG InfoCom and Nokia have moved wireless communications research and development activities to the area. The giant government-oriented research and consulting concern, the Science Applications International Corporation, last year acquired Bell Communications Research Inc. as part of a move into the communications field.</p>
        <p>According to Douglas Henton, president of Collaborative Economics in Palo Alto, Calif., industrial clusters linking companies around the manufacture of personal communication devices are now growing up in San Diego, mirroring a similar process in Silicon Valley. ''The big difference between the two communities is scale,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What it lacks in bulk, however, the wireless industry makes up in competitive fire. Today, the San Diego area is the home base of a new digital cellular transmission standard known as C.D.M.A., now the fastest-growing wireless technology in the United States. A consortium of 14 companies has established the Center for Wireless Communications at the university campus. It has recently embarked on the design of a  broadband wireless network that consortium members hope will transform the nature of all kinds of business and home communications.</p>
        <p>And San Diego has its own version of the Hewlett-Packard Company, Silicon Valley's pioneering electronics concern. In 1968, two San Diego engineering professors, Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Verterbi, started Linkabit, a part-time consulting firm focused on digital communications. The company grew into a full-time endeavor, making satellite communications gear for the military.</p>
        <p>Now almost three decades later, Linkabit has spun off more than 20 other companies, including Qualcomm, a business Mr. Jacobs founded with Mr. Verterbi after selling Linkabit in 1980.</p>
        <p>But more than the rise of any one company, it was the ascent of the Internet and a telecommunications explosion in the developing world that propelled a dramatic turnaround in the recession-plagued San Diego economy.</p>
        <p>Nearly 44,000 people had been employed in the military and aerospace industries in 1990, the peak for such employment. The contraction in Federal military contracting squeezed that labor force down to 14,600 today. Military contractors reduced their work forces or left the area.</p>
        <p>But the wireless business has helped bring an end to the subsequent recession in a quick three years. The wireless work force, only 5,200 in 1992, is now nearly half of what the military work force was at its peak, and growing rapidly.</p>
        <p>''The wireless communications business has changed the nature of San Diego's economy,'' said Robert Conn, dean of the school of engineering at the University of California at San Diego.</p>
        <p>And although the transformation seems an overnight occurrence, it has not been particularly easy. ''San Diego has had a problem of trying to retread a lot of guys who were at General Dynamics, which was military-oriented and slow moving,'' said Martha Dennis, vice president for engineering at Pacific Coast Services Inc., a wireless data company. That kind of corporate culture was far removed from the risk-taking style of companies like Qualcomm. ''Some made the cut and some didn't,'' Ms. Dennis said.</p>
        <p>Despite its proximity to Southern California's laid-back beach culture the new wireless communications industry has much more in common with the ''90 hours a week and loving it'' life style of Silicon Valley.</p>
        <p>No company better exemplifies that spirit than Qualcomm, which is leading the battle for its particular cellular standard, called code division multiple access. If this standard can prevail, making competing standards like T.D.M.A., or time division multiple access standard, used in Japan and the United States, and the European favorite, G.S.M., or Global Special Mobile, into the industry's Betamaxes, Qualcomm stands to do extremely well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs, who was traveling and unavailable for an interview last week, created Qualcomm as a company run largely by engineers. He  had gained a reputation as an independent thinker while a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, long before digital communications systems were thought feasible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs's company has demonstrated its ability to quickly seize business opportunities in new technology areas. For example, early in its rush to commercialize the Internet, Qualcomm licensed Eudora, an electronic mail software package. The program is now the Internet's most popular E-mail software.</p>
        <p>If Qualcomm is Wireless Valley's leading enterprise, the University of California at San Diego's School of Engineering's Center for Wireless Communications is the area's intellectual engine. Founded two years ago with backing from Qualcomm, Sprint, Hewlett-Packard, and other companies, the center has begun work on a radically new communications network.</p>
        <p>Led by an engineering professor, Anthony Acampora, a small team of faculty and students is exploring the possibility of leaping across the technology divide that until now has frustrated communications companies in their desire to reach America's homes with multimedia interactive data services.</p>
        <p>It is called the ''last mile'' problem: copper wires will not carry high-speed transmissions, but neither telephone nor cable companies have been willing to invest in connecting homes to fiber optic cables.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Acampora, who is a veteran wireless researcher with a 20-year career at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, said he was daydreaming during a long technical conference when he hit on another idea. Instead of using radio signals like today's cellular networks, he envisioned an optical-radio network.</p>
        <p>Low-power high-frequency radios that would deliver tens of megabits of video, data and voice information would gradually be installed in  homes and businesses. These local transmitters, called picocells, would in turn be connected to laser-based optical transceivers, installed on the rooftops of many structures, to carry digital information for the whole city at even higher data rates.</p>
        <p>''Each house would have a transceiver that would have four beams,''  Mr. Acampora said. ''It would create a dense web that could carry more information as more customers were added.''</p>
        <p>As with the Internet itself, each new participant would add value to the system as a whole. And the network would essentially be self-assembling, avoiding the billions of dollars in infrastructure investment that now stymies telephone and cable companies. Consumers would build the network themselves by buying transceivers at local stores, then installing them on their roofs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Acampora acknowledges that his hybrid network is a totally unproven idea. Lasers are now the best solution for sending high-speed data over fiber optic cables, but sending laser beams through the air raises both safety and reliability issues.</p>
        <p>''The idea of putting a laser cyclops on top of your house for fast data is really an interesting and novel idea,'' said James F. Moore, a telecommunications and computer industry consultant at Geopartners Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. ''Everyone else has been concerned with sending laser beams long distances through glass. These guys are thinking about short distances through the air.''</p>
        <p>The vision has captured the imagination of the center's small team of engineers, mathematicians and computer scientists, like Lawrence Larson, a professor of electrical engineering.</p>
        <p>''I was frustrated that many things that I had worked on had never taken off in a commercial sense,'' Mr. Larson said. ''I wanted to see something I had done in every home in the country.''</p>
        <p>If Wireless Valley continues to grow at its current remarkable pace, his chances are good.</p>
