        <p>Until several weeks ago, Adrian Targett, a high school history teacher, didn't appear to have much in common with Cheddar Man, a 9,000-year-old pile of bones at the Natural History Museum in London.</p>

        <p>Until several weeks ago, Adrian Targett, a high school history teacher, didn't appear to have much in common with Cheddar Man, a 9,000-year-old pile of bones at the Natural History Museum in London.</p>
        <p>Sure, Mr. Targett had heard of Cheddar Man, and had even visited the cave in this quaint Somerset village where his skeleton was found in 1903. But after a seemingly quixotic experiment in which scientists compared Cheddar Man's DNA to that of 20 local residents, Mr. Targett recently received a wholly unexpected piece of news: He is, it seems, related to Cheddar Man on his mother's side.</p>
        <p>''I'm thinking of writing to the Marquess of Bath, who owns these caves, and saying, 'I'd like my cave back,' '' Mr. Targett, 42, said over a meat pie and a pint in the local pub recently, considering the implications of having such a venerable relative. ''All those times I'd visited this cave before, and I'd never realized I was going home.''</p>
        <p>The experiment came about when a documentary film maker, researching a series on archeology in Somerset, in southwest England, decided to test whether Cheddar Man had any descendants in the area. A team of scientists from Oxford University extracted a small section of mitochondrial DNA, which is passed through the female line, from one of Cheddar Man's molars and compared it to scrapings of DNA taken from the cheeks of 20 local volunteers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Targett, who was born in Bristol, just 15 miles away, was a match, meaning that he is a descendant of a woman in Cheddar Man's family -- the ur-Cheddar Woman.</p>
        <p>''Cheddar Man and Mr. Targett share a common maternal ancestry, a direct link through the maternal line,'' said Bryan Sykes, head of the cellular genetics group at Oxford's Institute of Molecular Medicine, which conducted the study.</p>
        <p>''You go back and eventually you come to someone who is a direct ancestor of both of them, perhaps even Cheddar Man's mother or grandmother.''</p>
        <p>There are probably a lot of Cheddar descendants out there, said Mr. Sykes, whose team at Oxford is making a genetic map of all of Europe: About 1 to 1.5 percent of Britain's population is likely to share the same mitochondrial DNA markings found in Cheddar Man and Mr. Targett. Nor does the discovery necessarily mean that Mr. Targett's family has never strayed far from Cheddar all these millenniums, although this is a possibility.</p>
        <p>Cheddar Man has been a local celebrity since his discovery, and news of his links to Mr. Targett have inspired a rash of caveman jokes at the Kings of Wessex Community School, where Mr. Targett teaches modern European history (''I'm just wondering how I can work Cheddar Man into lessons about the rise of the Nazis,'' he told reporters).</p>
        <p>And though the school's receptionist described him as ''a sweetie,'' students are, perhaps inevitably, starting to call Mr. Targett ''Cheddar Man'' and to make subtle grunting noises when he passes them in the hallway.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the discovery has shone a happy light of fame on this small tourist village, known for its dairy products -- it gave its name to the cheese -- and for the spectacular artifacts unearthed from the catacomb of caves in the Cheddar Gorge.</p>
        <p>No one is happier, perhaps, than Bob Smart, who manages the Cheddar Show Caves Museum and is thrilled at the chance to discuss Cheddar Man, famous in human-origin circles for being the oldest complete skeleton ever found in Britain. So important is he that when Chris Stringer, principal researcher in the Human Origins Group at the Natural History Museum, took Cheddar Man's jawbone to a talk show recently, he refused to let it out of his sight, even taking it with him to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>''It's all worked out very nicely,'' said Mr. Smart, standing with Mr. Targett in front of a copy of the skeletal Cheddar Man. ''One of the points we have always tried to emphasize is that there's a close relationship between people now and the people living in these caves. They really were just like us.''</p>
        <p>Not to three cave-exploring people from Los Angeles, who looked at the skeleton, then at Mr. Targett, and then at the sign explaining their relationship. They pronounced themselves too shocked for coherent thought.</p>
        <p>''They don't look anything alike,'' one said, finally.</p>
        <p>How alike are they, this mild-mannered historian and the meat-eating hunter-gatherer from the middle Stone Age who lived hard and died young -- and probably violently, judging from the hole in the side of his head?</p>
        <p>''Maybe it explains why he likes his steak rare,'' Mr. Targett's wife, Catherine, a substitute teacher at her husband's school, told reporters when the news first broke. But in an interview, she said he was a thoroughly modern man, willing to help around the house and do the dishes.</p>
        <p>''He's not very interested in blood sports, although he does like walking in the country,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The discovery certainly has intriguing implications for people interested in uncovering their roots, a la Alex Haley. Family genealogy has long been a hobby of the Targetts, as it happens, and, in the past, Mrs. Targett has always won the competition to find more distant relatives. She can trace her mother's family back 12 generations, to Salisbury Plain in the early 1700's.</p>
        <p>Clearly, that pales in comparison to knowing the exact cave where your relative was buried in 7000 B.C., in an era when people ate wild boar and didn't know how to farm or make metal tools.</p>
        <p>''In one fell swoop, Adrian can go back 9,000 years,'' Mrs. Targett said, ''although his family tree has a lot of gaps in it.''</p>
        <p>But, obviously, Mr. Targett is not the only person on earth to have a Stone Age relative -- everyone else does, too.</p>
        <p>''The point is that we've all got 9,000-year-old ancestors,'' he said. ''I just happen to know who mine was.''</p>
