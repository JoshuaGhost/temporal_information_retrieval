        <p>Scene at New York Mets' spring training camp in Port St Lucie, Florida, described; Preston Wilson, son of Mookie Wilson, Mets' first base coach and former center fielder, hits first home run of spring in intrasquad game (M)</p>

        <p>When Jay Payton, a candidate to play right field for the Mets, injured his right elbow Tuesday, Manager Bobby Valentine said that Payton's setback would not necessarily change the workload for Carl Everett and Alex Ochoa, the other top competitors for the position.</p>
        <p>Valentine did say, however, that Payton's misfortune would create at-bats for outfielders considered long shots to make the club and that the opportunity was theirs to do with what they could. Today, Preston Wilson, the son of Mookie Wilson, the Mets' first base coach and former center fielder, took advantage. The long shot muscled an even longer shot for his first home run of the spring.</p>

        <p>When Jay Payton, a candidate to play right field for the Mets, injured his right elbow Tuesday, Manager Bobby Valentine said that Payton's setback would not necessarily change the workload for Carl Everett and Alex Ochoa, the other top competitors for the position.</p>
        <p>Valentine did say, however, that Payton's misfortune would create at-bats for outfielders considered long shots to make the club and that the opportunity was theirs to do with what they could. Today, Preston Wilson, the son of Mookie Wilson, the Mets' first base coach and former center fielder, took advantage. The long shot muscled an even longer shot for his first home run of the spring.</p>
        <p>Yes, it came in an intrasquad game, off Mike Welch, a minor leaguer who otherwise threw well. Welch retired the final six batters he faced and struck out two of the final three.</p>
        <p>But, for Wilson, the homer was something to cling to, a powerful statement made in the only at-bat by a player who has yet to advance past Class A ball.</p>
        <p>Valentine was watching, and he said later that the home run showed him Wilson was capable of using his power, which he has shown rather impressively in batting practice, in games.</p>
        <p>Yes, it was an intrasquad game, ''but it was competition,'' Valentine said. ''And it was not wind-aided; it was a legitimate blast.'' The ball cleared the fence in left-center field at St. Lucie County Stadium, where dead center is 410 feet from home plate.</p>
        <p>Wilson said he got only about 95 percent of the ball. ''It went more up than on the line,'' Wilson said. ''But I guess it was enough.''</p>
        <p>Though he feels for Payton, his sidelined friend, Wilson said of this sliver of an opening: ''You have to do it. It's a profession.''</p>
        <p>Exhibition Opener Today</p>
        <p>The Mets will begin the exhibition season Saturday against the Dodgers (Channel 9, 2 P.M.) with the following lineup: Lance Johnson, center field; Edgardo Alfonzo (2b), Bernard Gilkey (lf), John Olerud (1b), Butch Huskey (3b), Ochoa (rf), Tim Bogar (ss), Alberto Castillo (c). Bobby Jones will be the starting pitcher.</p>
        <p>Players who were still missing because of nagging injuries and were not expected to play this weekend were catcher Todd Hundley (tight left hamstring), shortstop Rey Ordonez (sore right shoulder), second baseman Carlos Baerga (hyperextended right elbow) and Jay Payton (scar tissue irritation in his reconstructed right elbow).</p>
        <p>Baerga said his elbow was back to about 85 percent and that adjustments in his swing have allowed him to sense more drive from his legs. ''I've got more pop in the bat and I feel quicker,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Hundley, who ended practice early Thursday when his hamstring tightened, today said ''it's nothing.'' He added that he did not know when he would play. ''Whenever I feel like it,'' he said, grinning.</p>
        <p>''Todd's hamstring is still a little tight, but it has progressed,'' Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Payton said that though his elbow was still sore, it had not bothered him to hit. Therefore, he hopes to get clearance Saturday to start facing live pitching again. As for throwing, he said, ''That's a day-to-day thing right now.''</p>
        <p>Clark Is Steady as Ever</p>
        <p>Mark Clark, the Mets' steadiest starter of 1996, pitched in his typically steady, economical fashion today, throwing two and a third scoreless innings and allowing just one hit. He walked two. Valentine praised Clark's location and sinker, and said his slider was O.K. ''Mark's pick-off move is greatly improved,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Joe Crawford, a left-hander hoping to crack the rotation, matched Clark's outing, throwing two scoreless innings with one hit, one walk and a strikeout. ''He was trying to work the inside part of the plate and did,'' said Valentine, who also praised Crawford's top pitch, his changeup.</p>
        <p>''I threw strikes and, when I put a guy on, I showed that I could throw a changeup wherever and had some good, inside fastballs,'' said Crawford, who was very pleased with his outing.</p>
        <p>Six Players Sign Deals</p>
        <p>The Mets signed six players to one-year contracts today but ended negotiations with the five other players left on the 40-man roster who are without deals.</p>
        <p>The five unsigned players -- pitchers Paul Wilson, Bill Pulsipher, Jason Isringhausen and Juan Acevedo and outfielder Alex Ochoa -- have until Sunday to accept the club's offer or have their contracts renewed.</p>
        <p>The players agreeing to one-year deals were infielders Rey Ordonez, Edgardo Alfonzo, Butch Huskey and Roberto Petagine, outfielder Carl Everett and catcher Alberto Castillo.</p>
