      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>American Ballet Theater began its ABT Studio Company as a junior touring ensemble, a workshop for new choreography and a farm team for the senior troupe. The good-looking teen-age ensemble, which made its formal theatrical debut on Thursday night at Kaye Playhouse, is clearly a fine idea well-realized.</p>
        <p>The program opened with Daniel Pelzig's new ''Idyla,'' set to music by Janacek. Lyrical but wandering, the plotless piece was a good showcase for the company's classical training and the dancers' individual presences. The lead dancers were Callye Andra, Micah Kurtzberg, John Hall and the piquant Emily Patterson.</p>

        <p>American Ballet Theater began its ABT Studio Company as a junior touring ensemble, a workshop for new choreography and a farm team for the senior troupe. The good-looking teen-age ensemble, which made its formal theatrical debut on Thursday night at Kaye Playhouse, is clearly a fine idea well-realized.</p>
        <p>The program opened with Daniel Pelzig's new ''Idyla,'' set to music by Janacek. Lyrical but wandering, the plotless piece was a good showcase for the company's classical training and the dancers' individual presences. The lead dancers were Callye Andra, Micah Kurtzberg, John Hall and the piquant Emily Patterson.</p>
        <p>Ms. Andra and Mr. Hall returned for a teasingly romantic duet from Lynne Taylor-Corbett's ''Great Galloping Gottschalk,'' looking like the self-absorbed youngsters from Jerome Robbins's ''Afternoon of a Faun'' out on a rambunctious third date. Ms. Andra was the strong center of Colin Connor's new ''Temps Perdu,'' also lyrical and meandering but with a compellingly undercurrent of urgent emotion.</p>
        <p>The choreographic high point was ''In Vauxhall Gardens,'' a new work by Hernando Cortez to music by Albinoni. A longtime Paul Taylor dancer, Mr. Cortez worked comfortably with a purer ballet vocabulary and with his score, in dynamically varied dance that stood out for its clear, bold stage patterns and juxtaposition of dancers.</p>
        <p>The dancers looked comfortable -- and exuberant -- in the piece. Here and earlier, Mr. Hall and Claudio Sandoval stood out for the refinement of their classical dancing. Mr. Kurtzberg and Cameron Gomez were interesting for their buoyant presence and infectiously joyous appetite for space. The fine cast was completed by Ms. Andra, Pauli Magierek, Lane Harwell, Brian Millett, Ms. Patterson, Kerryanne Saunders and Christin Severini, a member of Ballet Theater. Tammy Gargas completed the ensemble.</p>
