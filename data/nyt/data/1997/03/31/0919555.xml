        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your March 25 editorial ''Workers Deserve a Choice,'' on the proposed ''comp-time'' legislation that would allow workers to take compensation for overtime work in time off rather than extra pay, is off the mark.</p>
        <p>To say that the Democrats are opposing this legislation because of labor's financial support in the 1996 election misses the real reason for Democratic opposition -- namely, this is bad legislation that deprives workers of needed overtime compensation.</p>
        <p>Your editorial would lead us to believe this issue is solely the concern of labor leaders, but this is not so.</p>
        <p>In the steelworkers union alone, more than 40,000 workers have written to their representatives in Congress opposing the legislation.</p>
        <p>They understand the influence an employer can exercise in the workplace and that no matter how many safeguards are written into legislation, employers will seek ways to maximize their profit at the expense of workers.</p>
        <p>It is curious you recognize that employers already cheat workers out of earned overtime pay, yet you endorse ''comp time,'' a new method by which these workers can be victimized.</p>
        <p>Rather than supporting an experiment that will diminish the earnings of workers, wouldn't it be far better for you to endorse a more rigorous enforcement of the Fair Labor Standards Act? If employers truly want to become ''family friendly,'' they will deliver to their employees a level of wages that maintain middle-class living standards.</p>
