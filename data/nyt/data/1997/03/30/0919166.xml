        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A chart with ''Downsized, but Not Out: A Mill Town's Tale'' (March 9) said the first electric blanket was believed to have been made in 1946.</p>
        <p>I know otherwise. I received an electric blanket as a Christmas gift in 1942. I was in college, sleeping in an unheated attic-dormitory, weighed down by several heavy woolen blankets that did not keep me snug and warm.</p>
        <p>My fiance had gone to work for General Electric in Schenectady, N.Y. Early in December 1942, he made a visit to the employees' store, where electric blankets were on display. He bought one and immediately sent it to me in Indiana. I have not been without an electric blanket since (and have been married 53 1/2 years to that thoughtful electrical engineer).</p>
        <p>Those early blankets required a transformer, housed in a black plastic case about the size and weight of a five-pound bag of sugar. It strapped to the bed slats; one cord plugged into the blanket, and another into an electrical outlet.</p>
