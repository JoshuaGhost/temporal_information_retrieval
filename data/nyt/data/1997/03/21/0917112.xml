        <p>Channel 31's slogan should be amended to ''Sports rights fees, business and, oh, yeah, life'' because becoming a busy nighttime sports station is not cheap.</p>
        <p>A Securities and Exchange Commission document that describes the agreement for Cablevision Systems to take complete control of Madison Square Garden from ITT includes a price list for games that SportsChannel will sell to Channel 31. A contract must still be worked out.</p>
        <p>The new business and sports station is co-owned by ITT and Dow Jones &amp; Co.</p>
        <p>For this season, Channel 31's purchase of five Devils, Islanders and Nets games will cost $80,800, $80,800 and $73,100 each, respectively. The price for up to 15 Devils and Islanders games next season will stay the same, but the cost of each Nets game will jump to $77,000. For the 1998-99 season, Channel 31's per-game fee for up to 15 broadcasts of each team will be the same -- $83,400 -- an achievement in parity that should please Nets Coach John Calipari.</p>
        <p>If Channel 31 buys the maximum through 1999, it will cost $6.1 million.</p>
        <p>Now comes even bigger money for Channel 31: the Mets. The Mets' contract with Channel 9, which is a revenue-sharing arrangement, expires after next season. Channel 31 would love to have the Mets, but can only get them if the Yankees waive a provision in their MSG Network deal that would let its games coexist with those of the Mets on a local broadcast station.</p>
        <p>If available to Channel 31, the Mets' price would be $268,300 per game, for up to 50 games, with inflationary increases occurring from 1999 to 2011. Total cost: $13.7 million. The price list also includes an assumption that SportsChannel would buy from the Mets the rights to the 50 games Channel 9 has, a setup that would mirror MSG's ownership of the rights to 150 Yankee games.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. documents say that Channel 31 would pay an unspecified ''arm's length rights fee'' for Knicks and Rangers now appearing on MSG and for 50 Yankee games that have been on Channel 11 the past six seasons.</p>
        <p>If, by 1999, Channel 31 survives, and it buys every game contemplated in the contract, it would have 175 game telecasts. That critical mass will undoubtedly be part of the justification that Charles F. Dolan, Cablevision's chairman, will offer to critics who protest his plan to rejigger what he will charge cable subscribers to watch Knick, Ranger, Yankee, Devil, Islander, Net and Met games on MSG and SportsChannel, now that he controls both.</p>
        <p>The biggest wild card in this master plan is the Yankees. The Yankees' MSG deal requires that if the cable network makes a deal to put any games on a local broadcast station, the station must be a powerful one that can reach the market without any problem, especially for people without cable.</p>
        <p>Channel 11, a powerful VHF station, suited the Yankees, but so far Channel 31 has not. Yankee, MSG and Channel 31 officials have met several times, but so far the team is not convinced that the upgrade of Channel 31's station signal from low-power UHF status will satisfy viewers in the farthest reaches of New York's TV market. The Channel 31 upgrade is expected to be done by April 1.</p>
        <p>''Our goal is to be as strong as Channel 11,'' said Joe Townley, Channel 31's director of programming and production. ''They're a 'V,' we're a 'U.' Our goal is to be as strong a signal as can be.''</p>
        <p>Dolan said recently that the strong presence of games on free broadcast TV will be part of his rationale for charging more for some of the games that now appear as part of a cable subscriber's basic package.</p>
        <p>When you have leverage, you can do just about anything.</p>
        <p>Even control everything. Dolan can ultimately become the undisputed king of all sports media in New York if, in addition to owning MSG and SportsChannel, he also exercises an option he has to acquire ITT's half-interest in Channel 31 if ITT decides to sell it, or ITT is acquired, pending Dow Jones's approval.</p>
        <p>So, Dolan may soon own all or part of Madison Square Garden, the Knicks, the Rangers, MSG, SportsChannel and Channel 31. Unless another entity like an ad hoc Yankee network or a new regional sports channel is created, he will be the only bidder for Yankee TV rights after the 2000 season.</p>
        <p>But there's more: besides trying to corner the local market on live games, Dolan wants a meaty share of dead games, too, through his proposed launch of American Sports Classics to vie for nostalgic viewers with the Classic Sports Network, which complained Monday to the Federal Communications Commission that Dolan &amp; Co. demanded a piece of Classic to be carried on its cable systems.</p>
        <p>AIRWAVES</p>
        <p>If the National Collegiate Athletic Association men's tournament games seem long, they are: CBS is running 23 1/2 commercials a game, up from 20 during regular-season telecasts. . . . CBS rode the tournament to a second-place prime-time finish last week, following two first-place finishes. . . . The best thing about tournament broadcasts this year: knowing CLARK KELLOGG will be in the studio through the finale. . . . An HBO feature leading into tonight's ROY JONES JR.-MONTELL GRIFFIN bout shows Jones sparring and dancing in a ring with MUHAMMAD ALI, who briefly seemed to forget his Parkinson's syndrome. . . . The 28 1/2-hour WFAN Radiothon for the CJ Foundation for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome starts Wednesday at 5:30 A.M.</p>
