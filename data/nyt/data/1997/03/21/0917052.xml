        <p>Burton Lane's songs struck so deep into the American psyche that it is not unusual to hear people absent-mindedly humming them. Today, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers will honor the composer's six decades of work with a musical tribute at the Booth Theater.</p>
        <p>TONY BENNETT, MICHAEL FEINSTEIN, JUDY COLLINS and DOROTHY LOUDON are slated to be among the performers who will sing some of Mr. Lane's popular works. Mr. Lane, who died on Jan. 5 at 84, wrote songs like ''Babes on Broadway,'' ''Anything Can Happen in New York'' and ''(I Like New York in June) How About You?'' All of those are to be performed by Mr. Feinstein today.</p>
