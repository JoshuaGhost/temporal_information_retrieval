        <p>PLAIN vanilla may be passe in vehicle rentals. The rental companies report that customers increasingly want sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and convertibles instead of everyday cars. Susan Welty, a spokeswoman for Budget, said that a quarter of the Budget fleet now consisted of such specialty vehicles.</p>
        <p>Demetria Mudar, a spokeswoman for Avis, said that four-wheel drives now constitute 5 percent of the Avis fleet. ''They were increasing steadily over several years,'' she said. ''But there was a significant rise with the '97 model year. And where we once had them in ski locations, now they are available throughout the fleet.''</p>

        <p>PLAIN vanilla may be passe in vehicle rentals. The rental companies report that customers increasingly want sport utility vehicles, mini-vans and convertibles instead of everyday cars. Susan Welty, a spokeswoman for Budget, said that a quarter of the Budget fleet now consisted of such specialty vehicles.</p>
        <p>Demetria Mudar, a spokeswoman for Avis, said that four-wheel drives now constitute 5 percent of the Avis fleet. ''They were increasing steadily over several years,'' she said. ''But there was a significant rise with the '97 model year. And where we once had them in ski locations, now they are available throughout the fleet.''</p>
        <p>David L. Schoeneck, a spokesman for National-Interrent, also said that his company had ''significantly expanded'' the total of sport utility vehicles with the 1997 models last fall. He cited consumer demand and increasing availability from manufacturers as twin causes.</p>
        <p>These vehicles, he said, now constitute 5 percent of the National fleet, up from less than 1 percent a couple of years ago. A big part of consumer demand, he said, can be attributed to people's wish to rent a car like the one they drive at home.</p>
        <p>The other car rental companies have long lists of the specialty models they offer, ranging from Jaguars, in California, to Dodge Caravans.</p>
        <p>But now a new entry: Harley-Davidson lovers need not do without when they travel. A Budget franchise company operating for two years in Florida, Martha's Vineyard, Mass. and Boston has been expanding rapidly with rentals of the classic motorcycles; in 90210, naturally -- Beverly Hills -- another Budget franchise has been offering Harleys for about five months, and plans to open a new branch in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>A Niche Business</p>
        <p>The Harley-Davidson rental business is a curious niche, not for the frugal or the walk-up trade. Renters must be at least 25 and must have motorcycle endorsement permits on their operator's licenses. In addition to paying high daily rates, they must have a large credit margin to provide for a credit-card hold of $1,500 or $2,000 when they take the bike out.</p>
        <p>Michael Bessette is general manager of American Road Collection, which holds Budget franchises for motorcycle rentals in Daytona Beach and Miami, as well as in Martha's Vineyard and Boston, which are summertime locations. He expected to open Key West, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach offices this month and was looking west toward Aspen, Colo., for late spring. He said most of the rentals were less for transportation than for entertainment. The average age of his renter is 37, he said, and his renters are ''not so much interested in going fast as in being seen.'' Recently, he said, two Belgians rented Harleys to get married on.</p>
        <p>He requires a $2,000 credit hold for each rental -- cash is not accepted --  and the renter gets three antitheft devices to be used when the motorcycle is parked. The 40 bikes he rents in Daytona Beach -- Road King, Softtail, Fat Boy, Sportster, Dyna Wide Glide and Dyna Convertible models -- are worth $15,000 to $20,000 each. He said that so far they were doing pretty well on damage and theft. The worst theft hazard, he said, is when a rider turns away to top off the gas tank or buy a soda while the bike is unlocked. ''Zip, and it's gone,'' he said. He said ''a couple'' of his machines had been stolen and no renter had ever returned a lock that had been forced open.</p>
        <p>The rates for Mr. Bessette's machines, with 200 miles included, are $75 to $150 a day. At Daytona Beach, the rental shop is at 200 Coral Sea Avenue, on the airport grounds. In Miami, the rental counter adjoins the regular Budget counter at the airport. American Road Collection: (888) 736-8433.</p>
        <p>California Cruisers has the Budget motorcycle franchise in Beverly Hills. Ralph Biase, the general manager of the company, said he had 20 motorcycles available, and another was being delivered on the day he was interviewed in February. His rates start at $69.95 for a day and rise to $150. Currently, he said, there is no weekend or seasonal differential though that is likely to come. This company puts a hold of $1,500 on a credit card for each rental.</p>
        <p>The office is at 9815 Wilshire Boulevard, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90210, which is 10 minutes from the freeway. Normally, people arriving at Los Angeles International Airport take a cab, but arrangements can be made for pickups and for rental arrangements that provide a motorcycle and a car on alternating days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biase said when the San Francisco office opened, which he hoped would be this month, one-way motorcycle rentals would be possible. California Cruisers: (800) 227-7117 or (310) 274-9173.</p>
        <p>Sure-Footed and Fancy</p>
        <p>Beverly Hills is also the town for the introduction of fancy vehicles on four wheels. Thrifty Car Rental has put a few exotic cars into its fleet there and in Burbank, Calif.: three Mercedes-Benzes, two BMW's, a Lexus and a Jaguar.</p>
        <p>According to Melodye Blancett-Scott, a spokeswoman for Thrifty, the rental rates are $140 a day, with 150 miles included, with a fee of 35 cents a mile after that. Promotional rates for midsized cars right now would be $29.95 a day in Burbank or $59.99 in Beverly Hills, either with unlimited mileage. Those renting the expensive cars must be at least 25 years old, and a hold is put on their credit cards for the amount of the rental; reservations are essential.</p>
        <p>All the major companies now have at least one convertible, commonly the Chrysler Sebring, somewhere in their fleets, usually in ''sun'' locations -- Florida and the Southwest. These are priced in the upper ranges at most companies. At Avis, Ms. Mudar says, convertibles are popular items, with consistent high demand when the weather is good.</p>
        <p>National offers four models: the Sebring, the Chevrolet Cavalier and Camaro and the Pontiac Sunfire. Avis has the Sebring and the Sunfire; Alamo the Cavalier, the Sunfire and the Sebring; Hertz the Ford Mustang. Rentals of convertibles, like rentals of four-wheel drives and sport utility vehicles, mean more requirements. The company may require a credit-card guarantee. Under this arrangement, renters will forfeit a certain amount, $50 or $100 or the whole rental cost, if they do not pick up the vehicle; the company in its turn pledges to provide the promised vehicle at the promised time. The cancellation periods vary: the shortest is usually 24 hours.</p>
        <p>The sport utility vehicles and four-wheel drives in the major fleets cover the spectrum, and the lists are growing. The rental prices on these divide along size lines; for example, the Ford Expedition probably rents for more than the Ford Explorer because it is bigger.</p>
        <p>These vehicles, though often available at rental locations other than national parks and ski centers, still may involve no-show penalties or deposits. But rental of a four-wheel drive in summer in Aspen may not be so difficult as in the ski season.</p>
