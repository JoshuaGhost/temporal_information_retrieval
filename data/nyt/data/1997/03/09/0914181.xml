        <p>A British nanny who worked for a Massachusetts couple pleaded not guilty on Friday to first-degree murder charges here in the death of a 9-month boy in her care last month.</p>
        <p>An autopsy showed that the infant, Matthew Eappen of Newton, Mass., had died of a two-inch fracture to the back of his head, probably caused by being thrown or struck. Prosecutors also say the nanny, Louise Woodward, had shaken the baby until his brain hemorrhaged.</p>
        <p>Ms. Woodward, who turned 19 last week, pleaded not guilty to assault charges in February. Prosecutors added the murder charge after Matthew died on Feb. 9.</p>
        <p>Ms. Woodward arrived in the Boston area last July to work for EF Au Pair, a nanny-placement agency in Cambridge. She has been held without bail at the maximum security Framingham prison since her arrest on Feb. 5.</p>
