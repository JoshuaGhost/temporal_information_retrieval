      <block class="full_text">
        <p>FOR more than a century, outsiders controlled the economic destiny of the men and women who toiled in the textile mills of this coastal town south of Portland.</p>
        <p>Whether those who held this power were faceless Boston bankers, Southern textile brokers or Wall Street portfolio managers didn't matter much to the millworkers. Owners came and went, and the only visible sign of each transition was a new company name printed on payroll checks.</p>
        <p>So when word spread last July that Albert J. Dunlap had been hired as the chairman of the Sunbeam Corporation, owner of the Biddeford Textile Company, the 352 workers at the mill took the news calmly, expecting some manner of corporate shake-up but confident that their jobs were safe.</p>
        <p>After all, they reassured one another, they helped produce Sunbeam's popular, and profitable, ''Beauty With a Brain'' line of electric blankets. True, the controls and wiring were  manufactured in Mississippi and Mexico, but the fabric ''shells'' -- some four million of them last year -- were woven for Sunbeam exclusively on Biddeford Textile looms. Once finished, the electric blankets were shipped to department stores across the country and sold for up to $179.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dunlap didn't get his nickname ''Chainsaw Al'' for nothing. In November, he announced that the Biddeford plant would be either shut down or sold as part of his plan to slash Sunbeam's overall work force in half. When Robert B. Reich, then the nation's Labor Secretary, described the move as ''treating employees as if they are disposable pieces of equipment,'' Mr. Dunlap brushed off the criticism and said his first obligation was to the shareholders who hired him to make the company profitable.</p>
        <p>The mill hands reacted to the thunderbolt much as most people deal with death -- with disbelief, anger and depression. They have resisted, so far, only the last stage: acceptance.</p>
        <p>Perhaps they should have seen it coming. It was no secret that Mr. Dunlap had joined Sunbeam after lopping off 11,200 workers, one-third of the work force, at the Scott Paper Company in a mere 28 months, earning $100 million for his trouble. And the Biddeford workers' blankets, though of high quality, are far from high technology. It would be far cheaper to make them in a third world country.</p>
        <p>Moreover, plant closings are hardly unusual these days. About 10 times a week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a big factory shuts down somewhere in the United States, throwing an average of 190 people out of work with each closing. And those figures do not include the even larger number of mining and construction sites and service-company workplaces that are shuttered.</p>
        <p>But these are ordinary folks -- on the flip side of the investing public's obsession with the surging Dow Jones industrial average and the performance of its mutual funds. Many live from paycheck to paycheck, contribute to a modest union pension, but have no 401(k) plans or stock options.</p>
        <p>The Biddeford mill work force, including managers who worry as much about their own futures, now stands at under 300 because of winter layoffs. Few jobs in the local market come close to the $9 to $13 an hour that workers are paid to tend the thrumming weaving machines. Mill hands rely on a tradition of grit to see them through hard times, which in textiles in New England is almost a full-time job.</p>
        <p>Unraveling of a Mill Town</p>
        <p>That tradition goes back a long way. It is hard to imagine today, but this town was once a cradle of American industry, beginning in 1826 when the largest cotton mill in the country was built on an island where the Saco River plunged into spray-tossing cataracts. As production peaked earlier in this century, nearly 6,000 textile workers in different mills flooded the streets during shift changes.</p>
        <p>Yankee farmhands were the first millworkers, subsequently replaced by Irish immigrants and French-Canadians who trekked from rural Quebec, sometimes by foot, as production expanded and more cheap labor was needed. In this century, as New England textile mills bled jobs to Southern states with nonunion labor, companies were sold, merged or went out of business.</p>
        <p>With no money or political power to speak of, the mill hands relied on grit as their main weapon against anguish while waiting for Mr. Dunlap to decide whether to close or sell the mill. By year's end, few of them had any illusions about a boss who wrote a book called ''Mean Business'' and who relished his reputation as a tough guy with a mission from shareholders to clean up the mess left by his predecessors.</p>
        <p>Yet grit alone would not be enough to prevail against the executive suites of Sunbeam's South Florida headquarters. In the end, however, millworkers may be saved from the scrap heap of modern corporate history through a union effort to negotiate an employee stock ownership plan with the help of a private investor and a mill manager who -- in their eyes -- is as much a hero as Mr. Dunlap is a villain.</p>
        <p>Rumors, Hope and Anger</p>
        <p>The workers' first reaction to Mr. Dunlap's November announcement was shocked disbelief and bafflement. ''We've been working a lot of overtime this year, so no one guessed it would be this bad,'' muttered Rosaire Breault a few days before Thanksgiving, as he downed an early-morning $1 pint of beer at Pop's, a workers' hangout a block from the mill. ''We've always been a profitable place for Sunbeam. They've always made a buck here.''</p>
        <p>Rumors were still flying about Sunbeam's intentions, and Mr. Breault was under the false impression that Mr. Dunlap had set a Jan. 1 deadline for deciding whether to jettison the Biddeford factory. Weary from working the overnight shift, he looked out the window in silence for a while as the first snowfall of the season dusted the parked cars outside.</p>
        <p>''The thing nobody can figure out is, Why would Dunlap want to get rid of the only mill that makes shells for the electric blanket line he wants to keep?'' he finally said. ''It doesn't make sense.''</p>
        <p>Just down the street from Pop's, a similar incredulity reigned at the meeting hall of Local 1856 of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. A few members had gathered in an upstairs office, and they were in a combative mood.</p>
        <p>They suspected that Sunbeam had a hidden agenda: It would either bust the union contract and cut wages and health plan benefits, or it would sell the mill to a buyer who would crate up its modern machines and relocate production closer to Sunbeam's Mississippi plant, where the shells are shipped to be fitted with electrical-heating components.</p>
        <p>''Why else would they sell their only supplier?'' asked Ray Tilton, president of the local and the third generation in his family to work in the mill. ''It's like making an engine without a car to put it in.''</p>
        <p>''We're being sold because we're in the Northeast and a union shop,'' shot back Wally Szumita, another union official.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of half-empty textile mills in the South that would be happy to be Sunbeam's supplier,'' interjected Michael J. Cavanaugh, assistant manager of the union's regional board.</p>
        <p>The conversation soon veered into wishful thinking. ''They have no experience down there making blanket shells,'' declared Mr. Tilton, who works a second job driving a taxi at night. ''We have all the skills and the experience. No one else could do what we do. Not those Rebels, anyway.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Szumita picked up the theme. ''Not taking anything away from these Southerners,'' he rasped, ''but you can't find a good work force down there like you can here. Here the millworker takes pride in his work and will work 60 hours a week, every week, if you ask him.''</p>
        <p>Others in the room nodded agreement. endorsing a long-held sentiment. However, manufacturing workers in the South today can often earn as much as Biddeford's unionized workers. But that fact is tough to accept in a union hall whose members fear more job losses.</p>
        <p>''Compare our blankets with what they produce down there,'' he continued. ''Theirs are like a rag. If you went down there and said you were a millworker from Maine. they'd hire you in a heartbeat,'' he said, snapping his fingers for punctuation.</p>
        <p>Rita LaChance had listened to the exchange quietly. But when she spoke, the others fell silent.</p>
        <p>It is an axiom of the mill that the closer a job places a worker to the loom, the higher he or she is in the pecking order, both for pay and respect. And Mrs. LaChance, a gray-haired grandmother with a commanding voice that seems made of polished steel, stands atop the hierarchy. She has worked in textile mills for 42 years and is the head weaver at Biddeford Textile, in charge of setting the patterns that tell the automated looms what to weave.</p>
        <p>''Any company can weave our shells if they have our patterns,'' she said flatly, bringing the conversation down to earth.</p>
        <p>Recently installed modern machinery at the mill could be shipped almost anywhere, she said, even to Mexico.</p>
        <p>''I have the feeling, Ray,'' she said, softly now, as she looked at Mr. Tilton, ''if they wanted to move us down South they could do it. That's what scares me.''</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' replied Mr. Tilton, a little deflated but refusing to concede defeat. ''We have all the experience. The tradition. Our families are here.''</p>
        <p>''They could retrain workers and get it done in six months,'' Mrs. LaChance said, pursing her lips with conviction.</p>
        <p>''Family, traditions -- that means this much to Al Dunlap,'' said another person in the room, forming a zero with his thumb and forefinger.</p>
        <p>''Well, if some new owner comes in here and tells us to renegotiate our contract and cut benefits or he'll move South,'' Mr. Szumita retorted, growing angrier, ''we're going to tell him to take his company and get the hell out of town!''</p>
        <p>Similar scenes unfolded throughout this town of 21,000 in the early days. But the mood of defiance was hard to maintain against a faraway autocrat who held all the cards. By mid-December, it was giving way to fear in the mill families' lives.</p>
        <p>Specter of Minimum Wage</p>
        <p>Already, some millworkers were being idled in seasonal layoffs and other cutbacks. The rest were picking up their weekly paychecks not knowing whether each payment would be their last. Then, the week before Christmas, the mill was idled for repairs to a smokestack. There was no work and no pay.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, what bravado remained had an an air of desperation. ''I ain't going to let Al Dunlap spoil Christmas,'' Norm Gagnon sang out a little too brightly on a cold morning as sunshine streamed into his new kitchen.</p>
        <p>Last spring, Mr. Gagnon, 48, who had worked at the mill since 1974 as a carding-machine operator, and his wife Sharolyn, took out a $75,000 bank loan to remodel their home. That was a lot of money for a couple whose combined income at the time -- she made $11.99 an hour as a trouble-shooter in the spinning unit, he earned $10.44 -- totaled $900 a week. But, they figured, with overtime and with the extra money they made from their home photo-and-video sideline and her work as an Avon lady, they could afford to meet the repayments and pay the extra property taxes, totaling $300 a week.</p>
        <p>''If we'd known what was coming we'd have never taken that loan,'' Mrs. Gagnon said. ''But we're better off than most because we work at other jobs.'' Under a Christmas tree in the living room were piles of brightly wrapped gifts. ''We saved $1,500 in our Christmas club,'' she added. ''Not even Dunlap was going to take Christmas away from us.''</p>
        <p>She was wrong. Two days before Christmas, Mr. Gagnon was laid off with 37 other millworkers. The gift exchange with relatives the next day was a somber affair, and things have not improved. Now on $210-a-week unemployment, Mr. Gagnon has found little in the help-wanted ads that offers him much hope. ''The only jobs listed were picking shrimp or working in a warehouse for six or seven bucks an hour,'' he reported.</p>
        <p>The threat of losing their textile jobs -- and dropping down the economic ladder to within a couple of rungs of the minimum wage -- haunts the workforce. Millwork is hard, dusty, noisy and repetitive, requiring a high tolerance for boredom. But here, at least, it beats the alternatives.</p>
        <p>''In most cities the mills would be considered employers of last resort, but in Biddeford it's the cream,'' said Charles Butler Jr., head of the local historical society. ''Jobs pass down in families from one generation to the next because the wages and health benefits are good compared to anything else available in town.''</p>
        <p>Marge Perry, 39, a single mother who earns $12.37 an hour as a weaver, foresees a grim future if the Sunbeam plant closes. There is only one other textile plant in town, owned by West Point Stevens of West Point, Ga., but openings are scarce. About the only other job prospects are low-paying, menial work. ''I'll have to work two jobs just to make what I do now,'' she said wearily.</p>
        <p>Local Hero Plans a Rescue</p>
        <p>But maybe the mill won't close, after all.</p>
        <p>If there is a hero in this story, it is probably Rene Boisvert, Biddeford Textile's top executive who resigned in December rather than oversee the possible destruction of the company he had helped create.</p>
        <p>As quiet as Mr. Dunlap is brash, Mr. Boisvert (his full name is pronounced RAIN-ee BO-vye) is the model boss who came up through the ranks. Though he refuses to give his age, he says he started out 43 years ago on the production line at the Biddeford mill, then owned by West Point-Pepperell (since renamed West Point Stevens). When West Point-Pepperell's blanket division was having problems, Mr. Boisvert helped arrange its sale to Sunbeam in 1971. It was then renamed Biddeford Textile, with Mr. Boisvert in charge.</p>
        <p>After Sunbeam took over, ultimately becoming the only producer of electric blankets in the country, he never forgot his roots, making a practice of strolling on the production floor in his shirt sleeves and soliciting the workers' views on production improvements. His former charges talk about him in tones approaching reverence, and at first, his departure prompted despair.</p>
        <p>''We feel Rene was the only one looking out for the workers,'' Mrs. Gagnon said. But instead of heading for the sunny South, Mr. Boisvert got into the thick of negotiations to find a way to salvage his mill.</p>
        <p>The discussions, involving city and state officials, the union and Sunbeam, had begun almost as soon as Mr. Dunlap announced his intention to rid his company of the plant. Sunbeam assigned its investment bank, Chase Securities, a unit of Chase Manhattan, the task of seeking potential buyers. The union, for its part, engaged American Capital Strategies of Bethesda, Md., an investment bank that specializes in helping labor unions develop employee stock ownership plans to buy their companies, troubled or not. American Strategies helped Northwest Airlines employees with a limited buyout in 1993, for example.</p>
        <p>As January came and went without any developments, the remaining management team appeared as much in the dark as the workers about the mill's fate. ''Just like us, they don't know if they'll have a job when they show up for work tomorrow,'' said Ms. Perry, the weaver.</p>
        <p>Adding to the somber tone was news in January that a profitable Sunbeam unit in McMinnville, Tenn., which had been spared the Dunlap ax in November, was being closed and the operation moved to Mexico, at a loss of 650 jobs.</p>
        <p>As the talks in Biddeford progressed, details of a possible solution leaked out. An outside investor -- Michael Liberty, a Portland real-estate developer -- was willing to take a large stake in a new company that would buy the plant from Sunbeam for an unspecified sum. His two equity partners would be American Capital Strategies and the millworkers, who would make pay and benefits concessions in return for their stake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunlap, professing enthusiasm for the proposed agreement, pledged to continue buying the blankets for several years. He also said he would welcome efforts by the new company to sell blankets to other buyers; already, it sells one-tenth of its annual production to airlines and prisons.</p>
        <p>And running the show, as of old, would be Mr. Boisvert, who would take the title of president and chief executive of the new concern.</p>
        <p>The prospect of Mr. Boisvert's return heartened the rank and file as nothing else had throughout the cold winter. ''Rene is well-off enough to be playing golf in Florida this winter, but he really cares about the people who work at the mill and what happens to them,'' said a union member who requested anonymity, fearing that any comment on the record might be seized by Mr. Dunlap as an excuse to torpedo talks.</p>
        <p>Late last month, the group signed a letter of intent with Sunbeam to buy the mill and was given exclusive rights to close the deal by later this month. Confidentiality agreements have kept all the principals and their agents from commenting on all aspects of the pact.</p>
        <p>However, a Sunbeam official said the company was ''confident'' the sale to the workers could be achieved. John DeSimone, Sunbeam's director of investor relations, said Sunbeam had talked with other potential buyers, but that the Biddeford group ''is our first choice of the organizations we would like to sell the company to.'' Mr. DeSimone also said that Sunbeam was prepared to offer the worker group a five-year guaranteed supply contract. Sunbeam's agreement to buy all its electric-blanket shells from the Biddeford mill would give the factory a secure base for growth. And growth seems possible for this mill, especially now that Sunbeam is the only producer of electric blankets in the United States. Though electric-blanket sales dipped in the early 1990's, corresponding with consumer concern about the possible link between cancer and the electromagnetic fields they generate, those fears have been allayed somewhat by a National Research Council study that found no evidence of such a hazard. The Biddeford mill, meanwhile, has been modernized and it doubled production of electric-blanket shells from two million in 1990 to four million last year.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, the outside investors held a series of closed meetings with union members in Biddeford's City Hall to lay out their plans. With the memory of another local employee-ownership experiment that had failed still fresh in the minds of participants, several workers asked pointed questions about their own prospects. They listened quietly but respectfully to the answers, with one exception -- every time Mr. Boisvert spoke, they applauded.</p>
        <p>''We left the meeting feeling a little skeptical,'' reported Michael Boisvert (no relation to Rene), a 41-year old spinning-frame repairman who has worked at the mill since high school. ''We can negotiate what we feel we can give back in wages or benefits, but you can't expect us to work all week and not eat. If they want more than we can give, they can forget about it.''</p>
        <p>He had a reason for some pessimism. His wife, Barbara, had been involved in a similar employee-buyout effort at a local company named John Roberts, which made men's apparel. That attempt to save jobs collapsed in 1994 after three years.</p>
        <p>''The last two years were terrible, with the workers scared into making concessions like giving up 6 percent of their wages, all vacations and holidays, and they still had to shut down,'' Mrs. Boisvert said.</p>
        <p>For all that disquieting precedent, Mr. Cavanaugh, the union official, said any parallel to Biddeford Textile would be a stretch. John Roberts was in bankruptcy proceedings when the buyout plan was started as a last-ditch attempt to save jobs, he said. By contrast, he said, the local Sunbeam plant ''is very healthy, profitable and a leader in its industry.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, he added, invoking the name of the man of the hour, ''This group, headed by Rene Boisvert, has leadership and management skills everyone respects.''</p>
        <p>Yanked by the Stock Market</p>
        <p>The workers' optimism may be justified, according to Corey Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership, an advocacy group in Oakland, Calif. Prospects for employee buyouts of financially healthy companies generally are favorable, he said, if workers are not asked to make excessive  concessions and if the former owner stays involved. ''So much depends on keeping a good relationship with the former parent to maintain guarantees about buying the product,'' Mr. Rosen said.</p>
        <p>Now, as the clock ticks toward the deadline for closing the deal, the tension in Biddeford is almost palpable. Last Tuesday, Sunbeam officials met with Mr. Boisvert and union representatives to begin final negotiations on the sale, while a union team began work on concession proposals that would be put to a vote by the rank and file.</p>
        <p>Although the principals of the buying group remained tightlipped about final deals of an agreement, Mr. Boisvert seemed at pains to temper worker hostility toward the Sunbeam chief. ''We appreciate the opportunity Mr. Dunlap has given the workers to buy Biddeford Textile,'' he said last Thursday during a break in the negotiations. ''We have had a long and friendly relationship with Sunbeam and we hope to continue making shells for the company for some time to come.''</p>
        <p>If the deal goes through -- and most people expect it will -- the workers may need some time to get over their bitterness toward Mr. Dunlap, the man they blame for making their lives miserable. ''He has caused me more stress than the cancer surgery I had four years ago,'' said Ms. Perry, the 39-year-old single mother. ''But Chain Saw Al doesn't care who he steps on and squashes, as long as he gets paid his millions.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunlap brushes off such characterizations as misguided. ''Everyone whose job is threatened sees me as the villain because I am the visible symbol of change,'' he said in an interview during the midwinter International Housewares Show in Chicago, where he met with representatives of major retailers under banners heralding the company's new slogan: ''There's a New Sunbeam Shining -- Now There's a Bright Idea.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunlap remained unrepentant about the large-scale layoffs that Sunbeam has conducted nationwide. ''At the end of the day, I feel I've rescued 6,000 jobs that would've been lost because Sunbeam had become a basket case and would've gone out of business this year unless drastic changes were made,'' the West Point-trained paratroop officer said with square-jawed command. Indeed, Sunbeam's stock has vaulted from about $12.50 a share to more than $30 since he took charge.</p>
        <p>Whatever the outcome of the buyout attempt, the decision would not have many repercussions outside of Biddeford. It is a turn of events in an out-of-the-way place, but hardly one that will be noticed beyond the kitchens and parlors of the troubled workers.</p>
        <p>The Republican Mayor of Biddeford, James M. Grattelo, a businessman who owns an amusement park in Portsmouth, N.H., said there might be another villain in this story: The millions of people who have hitched a ride on the biggest bull market run in American stock-market history. It is these shareholders and their mutual-fund managers who put unremitting pressure on companies to raise stock prices, whatever the human cost, he suggested.</p>
        <p>''Al Dunlap's not stupid and he's not a monster,'' Mr. Grattelo said over lunch shortly after the November announcement. ''I don't want to defend him but he didn't create the stock market. We did. Businessmen, investors, people all around the country. They hold mutual funds, they have 401(k)'s. They want profits.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 16, 1997, Sunday</p>
        <p>A picture last Sunday with an article about a planned buyout of a Sunbeam Corporation textile plant in Biddeford, Me., was published in error. It showed part of the former Bates textile operations in Saco, across the Saco River from Biddeford.</p>
        <p>A picture caption misidentified two men involved in negotiations for the buyout. At left at the head of the table was Michael Cavanaugh, assistant manager of the regional board of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, not Rene Boisvert, the former top executive of the Biddeford mill. Next to Mr. Cavanaugh was Wally Szumita, business agent for Local 1856 of the union.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the party affiliation of the Mayor of Biddeford, James M. Grattelo. He is a Democrat, not a Republican.</p>
