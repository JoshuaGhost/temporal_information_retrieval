        <p>CHARACTERS</p>
        <p>ON THE LOOSE</p>
        <p>Stories.</p>
        <p>By Janet Kauffman.</p>
        <p>142 pp. St. Paul:</p>
        <p>Graywolf Press. Paper, $12.95.</p>
        <p>It is a curious paradox that while the 1980's are generally recalled as a time of excess, the literary manner most often associated with the period is minimalism -- curt fictional bulletins from the ordinary world, delivered in clipped and affectless prose. While Janet Kauffman's two earlier collections, ''Places in the World a Woman Could Walk'' and ''Obscene Gestures for Women,'' belonged to this mode, they were distinguished by their stringent wit and their clear-eyed feminism. And while much minimalist writing felt forced and evasive, Kauffman's careful, unadorned style seemed to fit the world of struggling farm families she wrote about. Her best stories managed, with remarkable economy, to be at once funny and haunting.</p>
        <p>Raised on a tobacco farm in Pennsylvania and for many years a farmer herself, Kauffman is now pushing her work in more experimental directions. ''Maybe because I'm farming less,'' she notes on the back cover of ''Characters on the Loose,'' her latest collection, ''I think I'm farming language more.'' But this time her efforts have produced a meager harvest.</p>
        <p>The root of the problem is evident in the jacket copy that follows her observation: ''In this collection,'' we are told, ''language, like ground, occupies physical space. For Kauffman, this is in many ways a feminist claiming of territory.'' But in what ways? Authors are entitled to theorize about their own work, but in too many of these stories Kauffman presses a none-too-precise theoretical agenda at the expense of narrative technique.</p>
        <p>There is, for example, the story called ''Signed Away,'' which asks, ''If you think about Emily Dickinson biking the new trail, well, would she do it?'' (Insert the word ''just'' and this might be a treatment for a highbrow Nike commercial.) The answer seems to be that she would, and that the experience would go like this: ''On the way out of town, she has words with herself. She letters, she says. A litter the language. Born with. What portion of me. Riding the Ordovician folds. Wheel and while. Time before tock.'' A litter indeed.</p>
        <p>Granted, most of the stories don't approach this level of syntactic meltdown. ''Nightmares for Everybody,'' ''Girl Games'' and ''Eureka in Toledo, Weather Permitting'' seem rambling and anecdotal at first, as they present mildly eccentric characters held together by loose familial and affective bonds and caught up in the rhythms of lower-middle-class Midwestern life. But in each Kauffman twists quotidian reality a few degrees to reveal unspoken depths of intensity and emotion. And then there are two stories -- ''Unhoused, Among the Trunks of Trees'' and ''What Lies Ahead,'' placed together for maximum effect -- in which the placid surface of daily life yields suddenly and inexorably to horror, disclosing a world both utterly real and absolutely mysterious.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, much of the rest of ''Characters on the Loose,'' when it is not gratingly self-conscious, feels slack and diffuse. The book's central, longest and most ambitious entry manages to be all these at once: ''26 Acts in 26 Letters'' is best described as an effort in literal pornography -- it describes sexual acts performed by the letters of the alphabet. There are illustrations (recalling a manual of typography), though they don't really correspond to the acts described, which exploit the curves, openings and appendages of the characters.</p>
        <p>The point seems to be to drive home the two meanings of the book's title: since both the people in stories and the letters out of which they are made are called characters, the idea of characters ''on the loose'' conjures a vision of language and its creatures liberated and at play. But like most puns, this one becomes less interesting the more you think about it.</p>
        <p>Loosed from the bonds of narrative precision, psychological insight or social observation, the characters in many of these stories become mere names, whose only purpose seems to be to occupy space on the page. Since Kauffman is a writer so clearly gifted with the capacity for precision, insight and observation, this is especially disappointing.</p>
