        <p>In the second such accident in two weeks, the last car of a subway train derailed at a switch early yesterday in Brooklyn, leaving four people injured and the car itself damaged beyond repair.</p>
        <p>Even as officials began examining yesterday's accident, which involved a southbound No. 2 train leaving the Franklin Avenue station, investigators said they believed the earlier crash in Harlem was most likely caused by human error on the part of a track worker. That accident, on July 3, left 15 people injured.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's crash was more likely caused by a mechanical problem, investigators said, though no official determination had been made in either case.</p>
        <p>About 1:15 A.M. yesterday, the 10 cars of the No. 2 train were making the turn south toward the President Street station on the leg of the line that leads to Flatbush Avenue. Most of the train, nine and a half cars, made the turn. But the last four wheels did not make the switch, traveling east on the line underneath Eastern Parkway.</p>
        <p>''The issue is what caused the last four wheels, the rear truck, to stay on the wrong track,'' said Jared Lebow, a spokesman for the New York City Transit Authority. He said the driver and the conductor underwent routine drug testing as part of the investigation.</p>
        <p>The spokesman said the train was traveling about 15 miles per hour when it crossed over the switch, one of 1,700 switches in the system.</p>
        <p>In the July 3 wreck, which involved an A train, the train had been traveling about 35 miles per hour, resulting in more injuries and more damage to the car.</p>
        <p>Investigators at the National Transportation Safety Board said yesterday that in the first accident, near 135th Street, there had been a switching problem reported on a parallel track and that a repairman had been working on it around the time of the  accident.</p>
        <p>''Maybe he was working on the switch on the parallel track and bumped the switch on the track where accident occurred,'' said Keith Holloway, a spokesman for the board. ''We are looking at human error as a cause.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holloway said some of the mechanical equipment was still being tested, but the switch on the A train track where the derailing occurred was working correctly. The board was not taking part in the new investigation.</p>
        <p>Leroy B. Spivey, the Transit Authority's  vice president for system safety, said the results of the two accidents were similar in that the trains diverged after crossing a switch, but he said it would be premature to rule on the cause of either accident. But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that yesterday's accident appeared to be a mechanical problem involving the track and the switches.</p>
        <p>None of the 120 passengers was in the last 51-foot car when it jumped the rail and hit a graffiti-covered, concrete protective wall. The impact shattered some of the thin concrete and left what looked like a giant karate chop in the middle of the car, bowing it slightly.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly we heard a big noise: Boom!'' said Jean Pintro, who had been returning from his job as a doorman in Manhattan. Mr. Pintro, 27, one of two men treated and released at Kings County Hospital, said he slid off his seat and banged his head.</p>
        <p>He said that for nearly two hours, the passengers, who were taken into the first five cars, were told repeatedly that they would be evacuated from the darkened tunnel. But he said rescuers did not get everyone out until 3 A.M.</p>
        <p>Siyani Wiggins, a 19-year-old returning from a recording session in Manhattan, had been trying to walk between cars when the train derailed. He said he was thrown backward and smacked his tail bone. He said he sat huddled in the dark fearing the worst, especially after the air conditioning failed and the temperature mounted.</p>
        <p>''I was sitting there paranoid like the train might be hijacked,'' said Mr. Wiggins, who was brought out on a stretcher. ''I was hoping ain't nobody coming through there to rob me.''</p>
        <p>The accident halted all train service to the seven stations on the southern leg of the No. 2 and 5 lines. For the morning rush hour, the Transit Authority provided special shuttle buses for the estimated 15,000 commuters affected, Mr. Lebow said. Train service was restored at about  3:15 P.M.</p>
        <p>Jane Paul, a home-care provider who works the overnight shift in New Jersey, said she usually arrives in the 42d Street station in Manhattan at about 10 A.M. and gets to Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn by 10:45 A.M. It was nearly noon yesterday before she got even close, and she was most upset that the conductor failed to announce which stations would be skipped despite saying the repeated delays were caused by the derailment.</p>
        <p>''What is this?'' Ms. Paul said. ''Why didn't the driver say anything?''</p>
        <p>In order to liberate the train with the derailed car, transit workers had to push the ninth and tenth cars back out onto the track running under Eastern Parkway. Because the 10th car had bowed, it would have ripped into the platforms it passed, so transit workers sliced it apart with torches.</p>
        <p>The switches involved in the accident are moved by the control tower at the Utica Avenue station. Each train driver signals the tower when the switches need to be moved, which is done with electric buttons that trigger air cylinders. The switches at this point are mechanically similar to those at 135th Street in that once a train is on them, they can only be moved to make sure they are locked in place; they cannot be reversed.</p>
        <p>After the wreck, the only immediately visible mechanical damage was one 39-foot piece of rail that had abrasions on it and had to be replaced, as well as one signal that had been knocked over, said Mark A. Yanche, a senior official in charge of track repair at the Transit Authority.</p>
