        <p>After an emotionally taxing evening when she saw for the first time the names of her grandparents among those of Czechs who died in Nazi gas chambers, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright spent an altogether cheerier day today in the land of her birth.</p>
        <p>President Vaclav Havel draped the red-and-white sash of the Order of the White Lion, the Czech Republic's highest honor, over her shoulders. Old friends, they exchanged words of praise.</p>
        <p>She exulted in ''a moment of special emotion and joy for both of us'' -- she having returned to her roots as the senior member of her country's Cabinet, he having achieved an invitation to NATO membership for his country.</p>
        <p>With the American Ambassador here, Jenonne Walker, Ms. Albright walked down the steps from the hilltop Prague Castle, stopping in the warm midday sun to gaze at the city's spires and to admire two Baroque squares. Almost giddily, the Secretary fingered her sash and the jeweled red star hanging from it, and asked Miss Walker, ''Who would ever have thought I'd get something like this?''</p>
        <p>This afternoon, in the magnificently restored Municipal House, one of the Continent's Art Nouveau masterpieces, the Secretary spoke admiringly of this country's fortitude during the long national nightmare after World War II.</p>
        <p>''The Communist authorities kept from you the truth, and still you spoke the truth,'' she told 750 leading Czechs. ''They fed you a vacuous culture and still you gave us works of art that fill our lives with intelligence, humor and warmth. They tried to smother your allegiances, your faith and your initiative, and still you taught the world the meaning of solidarity and civil society. They banished your finest leaders, and still you gave us Vaclav Havel.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright predicted that the Senate would approve the admission of the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary to NATO. But, she said, ''the burden of proof will still rest with those of us who believe that NATO enlargement serves American interests.'' Senators, she continued, ''will ask us many appropriate questions about risks and costs.''</p>
        <p>And she challenged American critics who, she said, echo Munich in offering to ''protect the freedom of Barcelona but not Brno, Stuttgart but not Szczecin.'' They should come to the East European countries, she said, and ''speak with their people, look them in the eye and tell them why we should be allied with Europe's old democracies forever, but its new democracies never.''</p>
        <p>Czech and American flags were draped behind Ms. Albright as she spoke. A red-coated brass band played when she entered the Smetana Hall in the Municipal House, designed by the Art Nouveau master Alphonse Mucha. Its every light fixture, sign and door handle, every mural, sculpture and stained-glass window has been restored to turn-of-the century elegance.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Albright, today's events closed other circles. Sitting in the front row at the little ceremony where she was given her sash was her first cousin, Dagmar Sima, 69, who lives in Prague. The two have seldom met in years past, but they met today for breakfast at the Inter-Continental Hotel, chatting in Czech.</p>
        <p>In her speech at the Municipal House, the Secretary quoted from T. S. Eliot's ''Four Quartets'' to characterize her journey from Prague to America and back, and this nation's journey from independence in 1918, to ''the day in 1948 when its liberty was extinguished,'' to its entry into the Atlantic alliance:</p>
        <p>We shall not cease from exploration</p>
        <p>And the end of all our exploring</p>
        <p>Will be to arrive where we started</p>
        <p>And know the place for the first time.</p>
        <p>The atmosphere was marred only by a contretemps over language.</p>
        <p>As the Secretary, a fluent Czech speaker, listened this morning to the interpretation of her English news-conference remarks into Czech, by Ivo Reznick, who works at the State Department in Washington, she became agitated. Finally, her patience snapped and she said to him, ''Not exactly,'' and delivered her own translation of the passage.</p>
        <p>That threw him off stride, and he stumbled through the rest of the session, freezing completely at one point. ''Translate my answer,'' Ms. Albright told him, and she remonstrated with him twice more before the news conference ended.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, she publicly reminded the Czechs that ''first-class membership in NATO requires a first-class contribution.'' She then said she was ''confident that the Czech Republic is ready as a mature democracy to accept responsibility for the security of others.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Havel said quite candidly that the republic had much to do in preparation for its NATO role, including modernization of weapons, adaptation of command and communications systems and, perhaps most important, changes in ''the underlying spirit'' of the military, to restore it ''to public esteem.''</p>
