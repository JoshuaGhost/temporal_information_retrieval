      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In a significant blow to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, a Federal judge yesterday struck down a New York City executive order that for eight years has barred city employees from turning in illegal immigrants who seek city services like police protection, schooling and medical care.</p>
        <p>The decision, by Judge John G. Koeltl of Federal District Court in Manhattan, upheld a provision of the new Federal welfare law, passed last year, that was intended to overturn the city's executive order and a few others like it around the country.</p>
        <p>Last September, in announcing that he would sue the Federal Government over the provision, the Mayor said that ending the executive order would ''create chaos in New York City.'' Without an iron-clad guarantee that they would not be turned in, illegal immigrants might refuse to send their children to school, report crimes to the police or seek treatment for contagious diseases, he said. The Mayor has since made his support for the executive order a staple of his regular speeches in praise of immigration, one of his major campaign themes.</p>
        <p>After learning of the decision last night, however, Mr. Giuliani tried to play down its impact, possibly in an effort to prevent the very chaos he had earlier predicted. He said that his dire warnings were a ''worst-case scenario,'' and that it might be possible to interpret the ruling narrowly to lessen its impact. In the meantime, he said, the city would almost certainly appeal the decision, possibly all the way to the United States  Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>He pointed out that the Federal law does not require city workers to report illegal immigrants, but only allows them to do so if they choose to.</p>
        <p>''What we will try to do is interpret this as narrowly as we can,'' he said. ''We can remind people that no one is required to turn in the names of illegal aliens, and we can encourage people not to do that.''</p>
        <p>Executive Order 124, signed by Mayor Edward I. Koch in 1989, said that no city employee or agency could turn over information regarding illegal aliens to Federal immigration authorities without the immigrant's permission or unless the immigrant was suspected of committing a crime. City agencies were encouraged to provide city services to illegal immigrants in the order, which was later renewed by Mayor David N. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Over the years, several members of Congress have tried to have the order overturned, but not until the welfare law was passed did any such attempts succeed. A one-sentence provision of the law, not even noticed by the city for weeks after the law was signed by President Clinton, said that no state or city could prohibit its employees from sending information about the status of an illegal alien to the Federal Government's Immigration and Naturalization Service. A report attached to the bill explained that immigration law enforcement was as high a priority as any other form of law enforcement.</p>
        <p>In its suit, the Giuliani administration argued that by forcing the city to abandon its own executive order, the law violated the principles of federalism and the 10th Amendment reserving certain powers to the states. Explaining his thinking in a speech last September, the Mayor said the welfare law provision would have the same effect as requiring teachers to report illegal immigrants, because the immigrants, not knowing which of the city's 200,000 employees might decide to report them, would assume that any employee might turn them in.</p>
        <p>''The illegal and undocumented parent, seeking to put their child in public school,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''would not know whether the superintendent or the principal or the administrator of that school was going to ask a question: 'Are you a citizen? Are you a legal resident alien, or are you illegal?' So it would have precisely the impact the order was intended to avoid.''</p>
        <p>But Judge Koeltl ruled that because the welfare law does not require city employees to turn in illegal immigrants, it did not impinge on the city's rights.</p>
        <p>''Although the statutes can be characterized as interfering with a city policy that prevents its officials from cooperating with Federal immigration authorities except in accordance with certain procedures,'' the judge wrote, ''that effect on local policy is not the type of intrusion that is sufficient to violate the Tenth Amendment or principles of federalism.''</p>
