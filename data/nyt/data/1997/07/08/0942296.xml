        <p>CHILDREN may chase after adult fireflies because they make great night lights in a jar, but the same glow of a baby firefly may keep chomping carnivores away.</p>
        <p>For almost 50 years, researchers have known that adult fireflies use light patterns as part of a mating ritual. Because baby fireflies are not mature enough to reproduce, researchers speculated that the larvae might use light cues for survival instead of reproduction.</p>
        <p>Dr. Douglas W. Tallamy, an entomologist at the University of Delaware, offered mice fireflies and  mealworms. All the mice rejected the foul-tasting fireflies in favor of the mealworms. In addition, the researchers showed that mice had the ability to associate light with bad-tasting tidbits.</p>
        <p>Dr. Tallamy and his colleagues  concluded that predators equate the firefly larvae's luminescence with its bitter taste. They reported their work in the May issue of The Journal of Insect Behavior, which was actually published last week.</p>
        <p>The study is believed to offer the first laboratory-based evidence of an insect using bioluminescence to advertise to predators that it is an untasty meal.</p>
        <p>''A flashing neon sign may lure hungry humans to an all-night diner,'' Dr. Tallamy said. ''But a firefly's bioluminescence warns the predator: it's not worth coming over because you are not going to like me anyway.''</p>
        <p>Bright colors, like the orange patterns on the monarch butterfly or the yellow stripes on a wasp, are examples of such warnings to predators, but the advantage of color is lost at night, Dr. Tallamy said. He said other insects, like some types of beetles, might use bioluminescence to warn predators.</p>
