        <p>After nine days and more than 1,050 miles of racing, the Tour de France arrived at its real starting point today.</p>
        <p>Forget Cedric Vasseur, the man wearing the overall leader's yellow jersey. Forget Erik Zabel, Nicola Minali and Jeroen Blijlevens, the sprinters who have dominated the first week along with Mario Cipollini, now a dropout because of knee problems. Forget the tumultuous charges to the finish line by several dozen riders.</p>
        <p>Starting Monday, the Tour enters the mountains, where the favorites will take charge.</p>
        <p>''In three days, we'll know who has lost the Tour,'' predicted Laurent Dufaux, a fine climber for Festina who finished fourth in the Tour last year.</p>
        <p>Who has won it is a question that will probably not be answered until the race emerges from the Alps on July 22. The answer may not even come until the last long time trial on July 26, a day before the final stage in Paris.</p>
        <p>The sprinters were at the forefront again today in the eighth of the 21 stages, 101 miles in hot and sometimes showery weather from the sweet-wine center of Sauternes to the hospitable city of Pau at the foot of the Pyrenees.</p>
        <p>Once again it was Zabel, a German who rides for the Telekom team, who crossed the finish line first, just ahead of Minali, an Italian with Batik, and Blijlevens, a Dutchman with TVM. Fourth was Frederic Moncassin, a Frenchman with Gan, who has been seeking his first victory this season and who was eighth into Bordeaux on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Zabel won that stage, too, the second of his three victories in the opening week. He and the three other top finishers into Pau crossed the line nearly aligned. The cameras and the judge gave the verdict to Zabel, who thrust his bicycle across the finish to get that small margin of victory.</p>
        <p>Zabel was timed in 3 hours 22 minutes 42 seconds, as was most of the 186-man field. Vasseur continued to wear the yellow jersey, holding an edge of 1:21 over Zabel, who benefited from a 20-second time deduction as the stage winner.</p>
        <p>Neither is likely to star in the Pyrenees, where the racing will change. After all their time on the plains, the riders will have to adjust to climbing, to using muscles they have not called on for more than a week and to pushing gears that were not needed on the flat.</p>
        <p>In addition, the two days in the Pyrenees will demand different strategies. ''On Monday,'' Dufaux said, ''the difficulties will come in a regular order. Tuesday, toward Andorra, they're all concentrated toward the finish.''</p>
        <p>Monday's stage will comprise four huge climbs, spaced evenly apart. On Tuesday, the riders tackle five peaks, three of them within 50 kilometers of the finish in Andorra. That stage is scheduled to last nearly eight hours. On Wednesday, the terrain descends from the Pyrenees into a long downhill to Perpignan, where the sprinters -- or those who lasted through the mountains -- may star again.</p>
        <p>The riders to watch for in the mountains include Bjarne Riis, Jan Ullrich, Abraham Olano, Richard Virenque, Luc Leblanc, Laurent Jalabert, Davide Rebellin, Oscar Camenzind, Marco Pantani, Peter Luttenberger and Dufaux.</p>
        <p>None of those climbers and all-round riders was mentioned often in the first week, as they were content to stay in the field and try to avoid being injured in crashes. That was a fate that forced the withdrawal from the Tour of such dark horses as Tony Rominger and Yevgeny Berzin.</p>
