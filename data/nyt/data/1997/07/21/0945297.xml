        <p>Most businessmen in this South Texas city were still contemplating their morning coffee. But Ed Whitacre was in full cry, excoriating what he called the Federal Government's unfair treatment of the local telephone industry. Then his own phone rang.</p>
        <p>Striding across his Texas-size office here, Mr. Whitacre picked up the receiver, listened intently and hung up without a word. Only a smile spreading across his craggy face hinted at the story: An appeals court in St. Louis had just thrown out the Federal Communications Commission's rules governing competition in the local phone market -- the same rules he had just been inveighing against.</p>
        <p>For Edward E. Whitacre Jr., the chairman of SBC Communications and a zealous defender of the local phone industry, it was as if the gods had finally heard him.</p>
        <p>''Our stockholders own the local phone network -- lock, stock, and barrel,'' Mr. Whitacre said. ''Now here comes the F.C.C., saying, 'we'll let everybody else lease that network at a 70 percent discount.' They expect us to tank our stockholders. No way.''</p>
        <p>Talk like that has made Mr. Whitacre a lightning rod in the growing debate about why competition has been so slow in coming to telephone service. On this day, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit handed him a victory over would-be competitors for local telephone service like AT&amp;T and MCI Communications. The court ruled that the F.C.C. does not have the right to impose national guidelines on how SBC and the other regional Bell companies open their markets.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Whitacre knows that the war for $100 billion local phone market is only starting. Indeed, on Saturday, the F.C.C. announced a sweeping agreement with Bell Atlantic and Nynex that will open their local-service markets to competition. Some analysts said the commission might be able to use that deal to pry open the monopolies of other Bells.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Whitacre acts as though he is defending the Alamo -- which is appropriate in a way, since the famous old garrison is only a few blocks away from SBC's downtown headquarters. And Mr. Whitacre looks like one might imagine Davy Crockett did, if he had lived to be 55.</p>
        <p>Never mind that SBC is hardly besieged: The company, which used to be called Southwestern Bell, has $25 billion in revenue, a territory that stretches from the Mississippi to the Pacific, and the fastest growth rate of the six Baby Bells. It is also the most pugnacious -- earning a reputation among critics as a company that will do almost anything to thwart the competition promised by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.</p>
        <p>''We need to talk turkey here,'' said Reed E. Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman and Mr. Whitacre's nemesis. ''SBC will not willingly embrace the national commitment to competition.''</p>
        <p>SBC's chairman responds that he is simply looking for a level playing field. But his down-home Texan traits -- the slow drawl, lanky 6-foot-4-inch frame and relaxed gait -- mask a chief executive who is considerably more ambitious than even the average Baby Bell executive.</p>
        <p>''Don't let that slow Southern accent fool you,'' said Sam Ginn, the chairman of Airtouch Communications. ''He is a tough, smart, shrewd executive.''</p>
        <p>In the last 15 months, Mr. Whitacre acquired another Baby Bell, Pacific Telesis, for $16.7 billion, applied for Federal permission to enter the long-distance business in Oklahoma, sued to overturn portions of the Telecommunications Act, and initiated negotiations with AT&amp;T on what would have been the largest corporate merger in history.</p>
        <p>People with knowledge of the matter said Mr. Whitacre also killed the AT&amp;T negotiations -- partly out of anger over a speech by AT&amp;T's chairman, Robert E. Allen, in which he accused the Baby Bells of dragging their feet in opening the local phone market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre even played an off-stage role in AT&amp;T's recent management turmoil. John R. Walter, the AT&amp;T president who resigned last week after the board told him he would not be named chief executive, first came under a public cloud during the SBC negotiations when it became apparent that Mr. Allen was ready to turn over command of the combined company to Mr. Whitacre rather than Mr. Walter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre refused to discuss the talks with AT&amp;T, which neither company ever confirmed. (''I might write a book some day,'' he said, after brushing off several questions about the subject.)</p>
        <p>But the fact that SBC was negotiating a merger with AT&amp;T in which it could have emerged as the dominant player speaks volumes about the company's muscle.</p>
        <p>''We broke out of the mold when we found we could be successful nationwide,'' Mr. Whitacre said. ''We're not the biggest, but I think we're certainly the best in this country.''</p>
        <p>With five years of double-digit earnings growth, a booming cellular business, a successful investment in Telefonos de Mexico, and a primary market in California and Texas, two fast-growing states, few industry watchers dispute that claim.</p>
        <p>Frank Governali, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, said that SBC's only vulnerability may be in California, which he said would come under fierce assault from new rivals because the state, the most populous by far, is such an attractive market.</p>
        <p>The strength of SBC's core market helps explain why Mr. Whitacre resolutely defends it. Several analysts noted that he believes local phone service will always be more profitable than long distance.</p>
        <p>''We can never forget that the heart of our business is local service,'' he said. ''It's been our business for over 100 years.''</p>
        <p>If SBC's competitors are to be believed, the company will play hard ball to hold on to these customers. In a recent letter to the F.C.C., MCI Communications accused SBC of calling customers immediately after they had been wooed by MCI about switching their local service, in order to sow doubts about MCI. Such tactics are brazen even for a Bell, said Jonathan Sallet, the chief policy counsel at MCI.</p>
        <p>''Although some of the Bells try to pull the wool over your eyes, SBC is a wolf in wolf's clothing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitacre rejects the accusation that SBC is anticompetitive. By the end of this year, he said, the company will have spent $1.2 billion and hired 4,000 new employees to open its markets.</p>
        <p>Most of these people work in customer service centers, where they process requests to switch local phone customers from SBC to rival carriers. At one such center in downtown Dallas, employees pass a security checkpoint intended to keep out SBC's regular salespeople, who could comb through the records if they wanted to hold on to customers.</p>
        <p>Unpleasant as it is, Mr. Whitacre said SBC was willing to sustain lost customers in order to gain entry into the long-distance market. But the company was recently rejected by the F.C.C. in its first bid to offer long-distance service -- in Oklahoma, because the commission concluded that there was barely a hint of competition.</p>
        <p>SBC went into combat mode. James D. Ellis, a bluff Iowa native who is the company's general counsel, filed a Federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the parts of the Telecommunications Act that put conditions on Bell entry into long distance. Mr. Ellis said the act unfairly bars the Bells from entering the market.</p>
        <p>William P. Barr, the general counsel of GTE, which has been allowed into long distance, said SBC's argument was shaky. ''I agree with them that the regulators have been heavy-handed and unfair,'' said Mr. Barr, a former United States Attorney General. ''But it will be hard for them to get the act struck down as unconstitutional.''</p>
        <p>Given all the sparks SBC sets off, one would think the company's executive suite is a noisy place. But subordinates say Mr. Whitacre is a quiet chief executive who listens carefully before making a decision. At SBC, he has gathered a cadre of executives, many of them Texans, who have worked with him for years and share his philosophy.</p>
        <p>The tightness of SBC's management enables the company to move swiftly to seize opportunities. Michael J. Price, a managing director at Lazard Freres &amp; Company, who advised the company on its acquisition of Pacific Telesis, said Mr. Whitacre nailed down that deal in three weeks, when it might have taken another chief executive several months.</p>
        <p>Since then, SBC has moved just as fast to meld Pacific Telesis into its operations. Mr. Whitacre has not hesitated to ruffle feathers -- shutting down the executive dining room at Pacific Telesis headquarters in San Francisco and requisitioning its corporate jet.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Mr. Whitacre moved SBC's headquarters from St. Louis to San Antonio to capitalize on the region's torrid growth. Since then, he has purchased a 1,200-acre ranch 80 miles north of here, where he keeps a small bulldozer to clear brush and dig ponds on his property.</p>
        <p>But Royce S. Caldwell, the president of SBC's core telephone operations and of Mr. Whitacre's closest confidants, said one ought never to forget that the boss is an intense man. On a recent weekend, Mr. Whitacre had Mr. Caldwell and another guest, the Mexican communications tycoon Carlos Slim Helu, out to the ranch for a convivial evening.</p>
        <p>The next Monday morning, Mr. Whitacre called Mr. Caldwell to his office to confront him on an SBC business matter. ''I swear, I got the worst chewing out of my life,'' said Mr. Caldwell, with a rueful laugh.</p>
