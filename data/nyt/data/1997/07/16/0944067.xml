        <p>When builders of the Wyndham Garden Hotel here dedicated the structure, they happily reported that occupancy rates in the first few weeks of operation had been unexpectedly high. ''In the second week after opening, we had sellouts,'' said Dave Johnson, senior vice president for operations at the Wyndham Hotel Corporation. ''That has not happened before.''</p>
        <p>This would seem an unlikely location for a hotel, a rural stretch of wooded hill country adjacent to Interstate 80, about 50 miles west of New York City. But it is part of the International Trade Center, a 670-acre business park that is home to companies employing nearly 6,000 people -- about the population of the entire township when I-80 was built here 30 years ago.</p>

        <p>When builders of the Wyndham Garden Hotel here dedicated the structure, they happily reported that occupancy rates in the first few weeks of operation had been unexpectedly high. ''In the second week after opening, we had sellouts,'' said Dave Johnson, senior vice president for operations at the Wyndham Hotel Corporation. ''That has not happened before.''</p>
        <p>This would seem an unlikely location for a hotel, a rural stretch of wooded hill country adjacent to Interstate 80, about 50 miles west of New York City. But it is part of the International Trade Center, a 670-acre business park that is home to companies employing nearly 6,000 people -- about the population of the entire township when I-80 was built here 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>''The hotel was part of the original master plan,'' said Leslie E. Smith Jr., executive director of the center. He said businesses located in the center need a place for visitors to stay and the nearest comparable lodgings are in Parsippany, which is about 25 miles away.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he said the BASF Group, the German chemical giant, insisted that the center commit to building a hotel before the company would agree to move its North American headquarters here, with about 2,000 employees.</p>
        <p>Business travelers have shown up as expected, but what has surprised the developers is the local demand for rooms for out-of-town visitors attending social events, like parties and athletic events. ''The local community has taken this place to heart,'' said Jonathan D. Green, president of the Rockefeller Center Development Corporation, a division of the Rockefeller Group, which owns 90 percent of the trade center and the affilated office park.</p>
        <p>When the hotel opened for business on June 9, its executives expected to rent no more than 30 rooms, said Carlos Molinet, the hotel's general manager. Instead, more than 60 were occupied. ''We had told the companies in the park what our opening date was, and they believed us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With a weekday room rate of $105 a night, including breakfast, the Wyndham Garden is positioned slightly above a midscale business hotel in the suburban market, Mr. Green said. The developers own the building, which is operated by Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts.</p>
        <p>The hotel, which was built in 12 months, has 141 rooms, including eight suites, in a five-story building. An attached one-story building holds a restaurant, an indoor swimming pool and a meeting room that can hold up to 300 people.</p>
        <p>The hotel is the latest amenity added to the trade center, about half of which is reserved for the New Jersey Foreign Trade Zone. The zone is, in effect, a duty-free port connected to the ocean by I-80. Companies operating in the zone are mostly warehouse and light manufacturing operations, while the rest of the center is occupied by office tenants.</p>
        <p>Among the companies in the trade center are BMW of North America, Calvin Klein Cosmetics, Lucent Technologies and the Shell Oil Company.</p>
        <p>In operation since 1982, the center is about half developed, with 3.5 million square feet of the permitted 7 million square feet of space completed. Most of the buildings are owned by the center and occupied by tenants on long-term leases.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith bought the land where the center is located from a visionary developer named Andrew Clark, who assembled the site in the 1950's when the Interstate System of highways was still in the planning stages. Mr. Clark believed that the highways would promote commerce the way railroads had in the 1800's and that because of them, free ports could easily be located inland. ''He knew that Route 80 was going somewhere near here, but he never expected that it would go right through the property as it did,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Clark retired, Mr. Smith bought the property and recruited the Rockefeller company as an investor, retaining a 10 percent interest in the project for himself. ''I was a local real estate developer who was looking for an international equity partner,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The first tenant, the Seiko Corporation, was signed up in 1982, Mr. Smith said, adding that ''15 years and 2 recessions later, we are still together.''</p>
