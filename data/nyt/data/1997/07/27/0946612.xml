        <p>If this particular New Jersey Transit train is late, you have no one to blame but yourself. It's made by Lionel; its route is in your rec room or basement, and punctuality is a personal matter. Last year, when Lionel introduced its first limited-edition set -- an engine and three passenger cars -- dealers couldn't keep up with the demand. Two thousand orders went unfilled.</p>
        <p>Lionel is issuing a second set, with a locomotive like those used for rail riders. (The old one was the kind used in rail yards.) It should be available in late October, but here promptness is a good idea: it's suggested that those interested order now from Lionel dealers so they won't be left running for the train.</p>
        <p>Suggested retail price: $299.95.</p>
