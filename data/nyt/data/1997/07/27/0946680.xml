        <p>A parish priest from Ireland was slashed across the face and robbed on a subway train early yesterday morning by assailants from a Catholic group home, the police said.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Steven O'Mahoney, who was not in his clerical clothing, was riding the A train back to St. Francis Church in Rockaway Beach around 1 A.M. when he was approached by four teen-agers who demanded his wallet. Though the police said Father  O'Mahoney quickly complied, one of the youths slashed him with a broken bottle, leaving a long gash that just missed his left eye.</p>
        <p>Father O'Mahoney, 40, was taken to Peninsula General Hospital, where he received 45 stitches and was released. The police have arrested four teen-age suspects, who all  live at St. John's Residence for Boys, a foster care center for disturbed or neglected boys near St. Francis Church.</p>
        <p>The suspects, Angel Rosario, 16, Lewis Harvey, 15, as well as an unidentified 15-year-old and a 14-year-old, were taken to the 100th Precinct station house yesterday and charged with robbery, assault and criminal possession of a weapon. They robbed the priest of $15 and a Visa card, Capt. Michael Morley said.</p>
        <p>At the time of the attack, Father O'Mahoney had been on his way back from Manhattan after visiting friends. The Rev. Michael Whelan, a fellow priest at the rectory, said that the injured priest was on a three-week sojourn from Ireland and had gone to visit friends and see the sights of New York City.</p>
        <p>Though the incident shook the priest, Father Whelan said that his friend had traveled around the world and knew that such things could happen anywhere. ''He told me that they were kids and this is their mentality,'' Father Whelan said of his friend. ''It is a minor, trivial, isolated incident and he is very brave.</p>
        <p>''Father O'Mahoney loves New York,'' Father Whelan said. ''I warned him to take the bus, but he never listens to me.''</p>
        <p>Captain Morley of the Police Department said that neighbors had filed numerous complaints about the home, which is run by a French order of priests. And upon hearing of yesterday's attack, many neighbors in the area complained anew about the home, which currently has 85 residents.</p>
        <p>One man who said he was the director of a neighborhood block association stood in front of the home waving what he said were arrest records and complaint forms filed against some of the residents, as a few of the 85 boys at the home peered silently from their windows.</p>
        <p>And at Healy's Pub next door, the men at the bar ran down a list of complaints. ''I've been living here for 40 years and it's never been this bad,'' said Jim Healy, the owner, adding that groups of the boys ''curse and play loud music all night.''</p>
        <p>His bartender, Mike Regan, echoed the complaints, saying that, while the boys are good natured when alone, they sometimes get into trouble when in a group.</p>
        <p>''They try to drag people into fights outside the bar,'' he said. ''They all think they're tough guys.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Tom Trager, 58, the executive director of the group home, said that the two older assailants named by the police had been sent to St. John's by the City's Administration for Children's Services because they were ''persons in need of supervision.'' The two younger suspects came to the home after being neglected or abandoned, he said. None of them had been there longer than two months, he said.</p>
        <p>While he acknowledged that the children in his home were sometimes problematic, Father Trager said they were seldom violent, with the most serious altercations with staff members coming when the children ''go AWOL and stay out past curfew.'' He said that the four teen-agers had sneaked out of the home through a back door Friday night  after their 10 P.M. curfew.</p>
        <p>''An incident like this takes its toll, but we are aggressively working with both the community and these children,'' Father Trager said, adding that the children in his facility have sometimes been hardened by their lives.</p>
        <p>''It's hard enough to raise one teen-ager, think about trying to raise 85 or 90,'' Father Trager concluded. ''A lot of these children take the better path, but who sees that?''</p>
