        <p>New York City prison officials recently met with Farrokh Anklesaria, who is the director of the Enlightened Sentencing Project in St. Louis. Topic: the possible use of Transcendental Meditation techniques in city jails. At a cost of $1,500 per inmate, Anklesaria says, T.M. training could reduce the recidivism rate in a big way, saving the government millions.

        <p>T.M. is undoubtedly soothing, but the idea that it can reduce crime is controversial. Popularized in the United States in the early 60's by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, T.M. has been tried in prisons here and abroad, but no independent research exists to prove that it alters criminal behavior. Skeptics doubt it, pointing out that T.M. advocates often make elaborate claims about what T.M. can do. In the summer of 1993, for example, thousands of T.M. meditators were asked to focus simultaneously on lowering the murder rate in Washington. Result? The murder rate actually rose that summer, said Barry Markovsky, a sociologist at the University of Iowa who has studied T.M.'s claims.</p>

        <p>As for New York, Riker's Island officials have decided to pass, but juvenile justice officials are still mulling it. We're looking at their proposal, said Peter Reinharz, New York City's chief prosecutor for juvenile crime, particularly the claim that T.M. offers internal self-control to juvenile offenders.
