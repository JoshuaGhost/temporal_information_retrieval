        <p>The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs announced yesterday that it had revoked the license of a Brooklyn booting company and issued violations against seven others that the department said had bilked consumers out of $20,000.</p>
        <p>Booting is often used in store parking lots as a way of discouraging non-customers from parking. The boot is attached to the wheel, and the motorist must pay to remove it.</p>
        <p>The department said there had been a growing number of complaints about booting companies charging exorbitant rates, operating in lots with no warning signs and insisting that consumers pay in cash. In 1995, there were 218 complaints. Last year, there were 409.</p>
        <p>So in June and July, undercover city inspectors monitored 25 locations in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. The department found, for example, that an employee of a booting company covered a no-parking sign at a lot near a Brooklyn theater, then invited moviegoers to park there. The company then booted the cars, charging motorists $100 apiece to remove them, the department said.</p>
        <p>In all, the city issued 1,000 violations -- each of which carries a penalty of up to $1,000 -- to eight companies. The Department of Consumer Affairs revoked the booting license of the worst offender, Marshall Parking Enforcement of Brooklyn, whose employees, the department said,  punched, sexually harassed and threatened motorists with pit bulls.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for the company could not be reached for comment.</p>
