        <p>A few days after GIANNI VERSACE was killed last week, RICHARD MARTIN, the curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, decided to turn the institute's annual winter exhibition into a tribute to the slain designer.</p>
        <p>Plans were already under way for a show on the history of fashion, but they were scuttled in favor of a comprehensive look at the various ways, from Greek classicism to plastic and leather, that Mr. Versace wove the past and future into his designs. The show's opening gala is scheduled for Dec. 8, and the show will open to the public on Dec. 11.</p>

        <p>A few days after GIANNI VERSACE was killed last week, RICHARD MARTIN, the curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, decided to turn the institute's annual winter exhibition into a tribute to the slain designer.</p>
        <p>Plans were already under way for a show on the history of fashion, but they were scuttled in favor of a comprehensive look at the various ways, from Greek classicism to plastic and leather, that Mr. Versace wove the past and future into his designs. The show's opening gala is scheduled for Dec. 8, and the show will open to the public on Dec. 11.</p>
        <p>Noting the incongruity between bloodshed and beauty, Mr. Martin said: ''The Metropolitan is the last museum in the world for which you would expect a 'real world' association. But art has restorative possibilities, and seeing Versace's work will be our collective recovery.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin is unusually familiar with Mr. Versace's work. He wrote a book about it that was published in May by Universe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Versace had strong ties to the museum and visited it frequently, sometimes spending hours at costume exhibits, Mr. Martin said.</p>
        <p>Would the loss of Mr. Versace cast a pall over the opening night party, a highlight of the social season. ''No,'' Mr. Martin said, ''I think it will be a splendid reckoning, a moment of assessment and farewell. But I also think the work will be so splendid that we will be overjoyed.''</p>
