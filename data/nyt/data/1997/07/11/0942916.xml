        <p>Since his release from prison, Mike Tyson has created an astounding economy all his own, a gross domestic boxing product worth $346 million in total pay-per-view sales from five fights, according to Paul Kagan Associates, which analyzes the cable industry.</p>
        <p>What will the pay-per-view world do without him?</p>
        <p>Survive on a diet of Evander Holyfield and Oscar De La Hoya.</p>
        <p>''They'll be the Ruth and Gehrig of pay-per-view,'' said Seth Abraham, the president of Time Warner Sports, the parent company of HBO Sports and TVKO.</p>
        <p>De La Hoya is bound to Time Warner for bouts that will alternate between premium cable on Home Box Office and pay-per-view on TVKO. But Holyfield will almost certainly stick to pay-per-view as long as he is the heavyweight champion.</p>
        <p>''He'll command the top purses, which can't be supported anywhere else but on pay-per-view,'' said Jay Larkin, the executive producer of Showtime Boxing, whose S.E.T. pay-per-view companion showed the June 28 Tyson-Holyfield bout.</p>
        <p>But neither fighter is a Tyson-level attraction. The welterweight De La Hoya, promoted by HBO as ''painfully handsome,'' drew 860,000 buyers to his fight against Pernell Whitaker in April. But non-heavyweights don't draw like the best heavyweights. And while he has a strong appeal with Hispanic buyers, succeeding that of Julio Cesar Chavez, he still is not a fearsome heavyweight.</p>
        <p>''If we get lucky, the De La Hoya-Hector Camacho fight on Sept. 13 could get close to one million buys,'' Abraham said. ''I'm not sure it will get there, but it will be 850,000 to 900,000 with the right undercard.''</p>
        <p>De La Hoya's basic attractiveness to pay-per-view buyers will be enhanced by Camacho's enhanced fighting reputation and his ability to promote himself. ''Camacho is a terrific foil,'' Abraham said. ''He's clever and doesn't take it too far.''</p>
        <p>Unlike with Tyson, Holyfield's and De La Hoya's foes will truly matter for pay-per-view success. Peter McNeeley, Bruce Seldon and Frank Bruno were dustbin bums, but their bouts with Tyson produced 3.9 million pay-per-viewers, according to Kagan.</p>
        <p>Holyfield's two defeats of Tyson may have increased his appeal to casual viewers who otherwise might not spend $50 for a fight -- which may help him if he faces such charisma-free boxers as Michael Moorer and Lennox Lewis -- but his allure is unlikely to match Tyson's. Unless he fights Tyson again.</p>
        <p>It's almost certain that such possible Holyfield bouts would not match the 1.99 million buys estimated by Kagan for Tyson-Holyfield II or the 1.59 million for Tyson-Holyfield I. And, if Henry Akinwande beats Lewis tomorrow night in their World Boxing Council title fight in Lake Tahoe, Nev., Holyfield-Akinwande would seem even less of an attraction for viewers who are not core boxing fans.</p>
        <p>Bill Micheletti, a Kagan analyst, said: ''Pay-per-view won't be on the high it was with Tyson. There are no up-and-coming heavyweights for pay-per-view.''</p>
        <p>Despite Abraham's insistence that Holyfield is a television free agent, able to choose between fighting on S.E.T. or TVKO, Larkin said he is bound to the Showtime on pay-per-view, thus becoming its post-Tyson bell cow.</p>
        <p>''We have a relationship with Evander that goes beyond his contract with Don King,'' Larkin said.</p>
        <p>A footnote: CBS exited its $750,000 deal with Showtime to replay Tyson-Holyfield II in prime time next month, but ABC has stepped up with $1 million to show the bout. No one at ABC would say why it wants to show the fight, which will be replayed by Showtime three times before its ABC air date. Said Vince Wladika, a Fox Sports spokesman, ''Why would we pay $1 million for a re-re-re-repeat?''</p>
        <p>Seeking a Silver Lining</p>
        <p>Fox is finding some solace in the dismal 11.8 Nielsen rating for Tuesday's All-Star Game. Sure, it's the lowest in history, down from NBC's 13.2 last year. Even more disturbing is a 23 percent ratings drop among men 55 and over, the largest component of the All-Star Game audience. That oldest male demographic made up only 35 percent of the game's total viewership, down from 40 percent last year. More bad news: ratings for men 18-to-34 and 18-to-49 fell by 4 percent.</p>
        <p>But Fox is gleeful that ratings rose 38 percent among male teen-agers, 37 percent among all teen-agers and 13 percent among kids 2 to 11.</p>
        <p>It is a mixed bag, especially with Fox knowing of no reason why older men should be deserting baseball. But there is joy over attracting more kids.</p>
        <p>''We did what we said we would do, which was to youthify baseball,'' Wladika said. ''The point was to build up young viewership, but we didn't realize an offshoot was to lose some older viewers. I don't think we're doing anything to turn off older viewers but our network does skew young.''</p>
