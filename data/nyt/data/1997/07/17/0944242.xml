        <p>Sporty new wheelchair being marketed by Cannondale Co noted (Currents) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>IT is no accident that this sporty new wheelchair appears to be a collage of parts from a high-performance mountain bike. Cycling enthusiasts may recognize the plump 6061-grade Alcoa aluminum tubing, the signature of Cannondale racing bicycles. The chair is due out in September. Cannondale's founder, Joseph S. Montgomery, 57, was inspired by his son Michael, 10, who loves to ski and play hockey, although cerebral palsy keeps him in a wheelchair. Mr. Armstrong also hopes for a share of what he says is a $400-million-a-year sports and lightweight wheelchair market. The Cannondale is lighter than most wheelchairs, and its wheels splay outward for better cornering. Both the sports model (left, up to $4,500) and the everyday model (right, $1,500 to $2,000) will be sold in bicycle shops. Their prices are competitive with those of conventional chairs. Information: (203) 544-9800, or in a few weeks at www.cannondale.com on the Internet.</p>
