        <p>The Russian plan for an arduous space walk to repair the Mir space station is technically sound and would not pose excessive risks to the American member of the crew if he is given the assignment, a team of NASA specialists has concluded.</p>
        <p>''Technically, I do not see any show-stoppers,'' said Leroy Chiao, an American astronaut dispatched here to assess the Mir repair mission. ''Based on our assessment the risks are manageable.''</p>
        <p>NASA, which has come under fire on Capital Hill for its involvement with the trouble-plagued Mir, has publicly taken a cautious stance toward the Russian proposal to include the American astronaut, Michael Foale, in the space walk.</p>
        <p>But the team of NASA specialists that reviewed the Russian repair procedures and contingency plans endorsed the mission. Mr. Chiao also talked with Mr. Foale, who indicated he was prepared to carry out the repairs.</p>
        <p>''The team here has given the recommendation back to Houston that it can be performed safely,'' Mr. Chiao said in an interview at the Russian Mission Control Center here near Moscow.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Chiao, the team includes Richard Fullerton and Jerry Miller, two NASA specialists on space walks, as well as Philip Engelauf, a flight director.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, NASA will formally announce whether it will allow the British-born Mr. Foale, an astrophysicist, to undergo training for the complex repair mission. If the training proceeds, as expected, a decision on whether Mr. Foale will carry out the actual repairs would not be made until next week.</p>
        <p>The main goal of the repair is to restore power to the Mir, which was damaged in a June 25 collision with a Progress cargo craft. This entails entering the holed Spektr module, which has been sealed off, reattaching electrical cables from the solar arrays there to a specially designed hatch and resealing the module.</p>
        <p>But the technical aspects of the mission have often been overshadowed by a broader debate over the safety of the 11-year-old Mir and the future of American-Russian space cooperation.</p>
        <p>Though there is no immediate danger to the crew, the Russians are eager to carry out the repairs and restore the Mir as a fully functioning space station.</p>
        <p>Some American space officials, such as Mr. Chiao, believe the United States can still learn much from stationing astronauts on the Mir, particularly since NASA is involved in developing an international space station for the next century. But critics say the Mir is becoming too dangerous for American astronauts.</p>
        <p>In terms of personalities, the repair mission has already become something of a space drama. Vasily Tsibliyev, the Russian commander of the Mir and a veteran astronaut, was pulled off the mission after Russian physicians concluded he has become disabled by stress and an irregular heartbeat.</p>
        <p>That left the repairs to the remaining two members of the crew, Aleksandr Lazutkin and Mr. Foale. Mr. Lazutkin would have the lead role in the repair and would be the only crew member to enter the Spektr module. Trained at the Moscow Aviation Institute as an engineer, he is also a gymnast and a parachutist. But he has never conducted a space walk and was never in space until February, when he came aboard the Mir.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foale would have an important secondary role and would stay in the node adjacent to the Spektr module. A veteran of three space flights, he conducted a space walk during a 1995 American shuttle mission. As a backup for Jerry Linenger, the previous American astronaut on the Mir, Mr. Foale trained for an external space walk in a Russian space suit.</p>
        <p>According to the Russian plan, both men would don Russian space suits. They would then enter the node adjacent to the damaged Spektr module and seal the node off from the rest of the Mir space station.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foale would operate the controls that would let the air out of the node to create a vacuum. He would also assist Mr. Lazutkin by, for example, handing him tools.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Lazutkin who would have the most difficult part of the mission. After the astronauts removed the hatch to Spektr, Mr. Lazutkin would look inside using a flashlight. Then he would enter Spektr feet first, taking care to avoid any objects that might rip his space suit.</p>
        <p>Space officials are also concerned that the collision may have damaged some of the contents of the Spektr module, which was used for laboratory experiments. There is the danger, for example, that floating debris or spilled chemicals could drift into the Mir, endangering the astronauts. So Mr. Lazutkin would use a towel to capture floating liquid or broken glass.</p>
        <p>Once inside he would attach the cables to a special hatch, which would let the power pass through without letting the air out. After Mr. Lazutkin left Spektr the hatch would be reattached. The node would then be repressurized by opening a passage to the core module of the Mir.</p>
        <p>Oxygen bottles would also be used to restore the atmosphere. An additional set of cables would be attached, so that the power could pass from the hatch to the rest of the Mir.</p>
        <p>If the mission is successful, power will restored to the Mir and the air inside the space station will not leak out. But if the hatch cannot be sealed properly and there is a large leak, the crew will have to evacuate using the Soyuz spacecraft docked alongside. Mr. Tsibliyev will stay in the Soyuz while the five-hour space walk is being conducted.</p>
        <p>NASA officials said the training would be carried out in several stages. First the team would practice the procedure without space suits. On Monday, they would carry out a full-scale dress rehearsal, wearing space suits. This practice is to be carried out in the node and in the pressured Krystall module, which will simulate Spektr, Mr. Chiao said.</p>
        <p>While NASA officials in Houston insisted the agency has not yet decided on on Mr. Foale's role, Russian officials sought to convince the space agency to allow him to participate.</p>
        <p>Vladimir Solovoyov, the mission control chief, said that Mr. Foale did not see any special problems in the mission and ''is sure it would be a success.''</p>
