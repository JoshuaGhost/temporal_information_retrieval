        <p>Of the 50,000 bats that make their home on the grounds of the Picatinny Arsenal, one tiny group has attracted the attention of scientists -- and $400,000 in Federal money.</p>

        <p>Of the 50,000 bats that make their home on the grounds of the Picatinny Arsenal, one tiny group has attracted the attention of scientists -- and $400,000 in Federal money.</p>
        <p>It is the Indiana bat, a palm-sized brown variety found in much greater numbers in the Midwest. About 30 were discovered in a cave on the grounds last year.</p>
        <p>The Indiana bat is classified as an endangered species; there are only 500,000 left in the United States.</p>
        <p>Today, a group of researchers led by Dr. Thomas Kunz, a biologist at Boston University, will attempt to capture some of the bats and tag them with radio transmitters. They hope to find out why they have strayed so far from their usual habitat.</p>
        <p>The Indiana bat spends the winter in caves, where spelunkers often disturb its hibernation patterns, causing reproductive problems, Dr. Kunz said.</p>
