        <p>A deadlocked Federal Communications Commission handed President Clinton a temporary defeat today, blocking a proposed investigation into the advertising of hard liquor on television.</p>
        <p>Distillers began running a limited number of advertisements in local markets and on cable stations last year, lifting a self-imposed ban on broadcast advertising that had lasted nearly 50 years. The major networks have so far refused to carry the liquor commercials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton asked the commission in April to investigate the effects of such advertising, particularly on children. The President's call was  supported by Reed E. Hundt, the commission chairman, but split the panel along ideological lines.</p>
        <p>The commissioners voted 2 to 2 today on a motion to authorize the inquiry. The tie killed the measure, at least for now. One seat on the five-member commission is vacant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hundt and Commissioner Susan Ness voted for the investigation; Commissioners James H. Quello and Rachelle B. Chong opposed it.</p>
        <p>The inquiry would have looked into  questions like how many liquor commercials were running now and at what times and how many children were seeing them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hundt said he was disappointed that a majority of the commission refused to open the inquiry now, and said he hoped that the panel would take up the issue in the future.</p>
        <p>''How can anyone justify curtailing this legitimate inquiry?'' Mr. Hundt asked at a morning meeting of the commission. ''No one disputes that the issues are important. Indeed, the commissioners who oppose this inquiry publicly proclaim that the introduction of hard liquor ads on broadcast TV is troubling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Quello and Ms. Chong said the commission lacked jurisdiction over the societal effects of broadcast advertisements. In addition, they said, an inquiry would duplicate an investigation already under way at the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chong said that while the commission had a duty to insure that broadcasters served the public interest, it did not have the authority to regulate content of advertising or programming.</p>
        <p>''If we start this investigation under our broad public interest mandate,'' Ms. Chong asked, ''would we then have an obligation to also investigate car advertising that features air bags and sugared cereal advertising? I see no logical or constitutional distinction between the arguments about liquor advertising and any other legal product where health and safety concerns have been raised.''</p>
        <p>The liquor industry applauded the defeat of the measure, saying that it would have been unfair to subject liquor advertising to a higher level of regulation than is imposed on beer and wine commercials.</p>
