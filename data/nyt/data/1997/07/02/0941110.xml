        <p>New York State Comptroller H Carl McCall says that School Construction Authority, $4.7 billion agency that builds New York City schools, has failed to do background checks on some of its contractors and built schools that, according to their principals, begin falling apart soon after they are erected (M)</p>

        <p>The agency responsible for a 4-year-old girl who died in the home of one of the agency's foster mothers had been warned by another agency that the parent had neglected other children, city officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The agency, Louise Wise Services, which monitors 650 foster children for the city, was told that the woman had recently been barred from caring for foster children after caseworkers noticed that the clothing of the siblings in her care was soiled.</p>
        <p>The warning came from officials at the Little Flower agency. In a letter dated July 8, they said the woman, Patricia Coker, might be an inappropriate foster parent.</p>
        <p>Two weeks later, the Louise Wise agency put four foster children in Ms. Coker's home. Last week, prosecutors say, one of those children, Caprice Reid, 4, went without food for four days and endured repeated beatings at the hands of her caretakers. She was tied to a chair, prosecutors say, and beaten with a stick until she could no longer walk. On Sunday, Caprice was dead, her body covered with bruises.</p>
        <p>Ms. Coker and her mother, Betty Coker, were arrested on charges of assault and endangering the welfare of a child. Prosecutors say the charges may be upgraded depending on the autopsy results.</p>
        <p>The portrait of Patricia Coker, 26, as a troubled foster mother was a stark departure from the image city officials had presented on Monday, when the Louise Wise agency had informed them that she had no known history of neglect or abuse.</p>
        <p>The revelations also raised serious questions about how the private agencies, which monitor most of New York City's foster children, screen potential foster parents.</p>
        <p>Officials at Louise Wise referred all questions yesterday to officials at the Administration for Children's Services, the city's child welfare agency, which monitors foster care.</p>
        <p>Those city officials, who had already begun an intensive investigation, expressed concern yesterday about the agency's screening process, saying they had demanded copies of all records involving the Coker family. ''Our investigation is focusing specifically on the manner in which this foster parent was selected, certified and monitored by the Louise Wise agency,'' Nicholas Scoppetta, commissioner of the Administration for Children's Services, said in a statement last night.</p>
        <p>It is unclear why officials at the Louise Wise agency disregarded the warning, or whether they ever contacted the Little Flower agency to investigate further. Maggie Lear, a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children's Services, said officials at the Little Flower agency never reported their concerns to the State Central Register, which catalogues all abuse and neglect complaints,  after they took the children from Ms. Coker's home in February 1996.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lear said caseworkers at the Little Flower agency felt they lacked enough evidence of neglect to make a formal complaint. Officials at the Louise Wise agency, Ms. Lear noted, did all the required checks: calling the state register, visiting the home and getting character references. Those background checks turned up no abuse or complaints.</p>
        <p>Still, executives at other foster care agencies said it would be highly unusual not to thoroughly investigate a foster parent who had been barred from caring for foster children.</p>
        <p>''We would always call the previous agency,'' said Betsy Mayberry of the Children's Aid Society, a long-established foster care agency. ''Even if it was just a case of inadequate caretaking, you'd want to know about it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Coker, a home heath aide, cared for Caprice and her three siblings for nearly a year. The Louise Wise caseworker met with the family more than 30 times and found nothing amiss. And Legal Aid lawyers, who represented the children, reported that the children enjoyed living with Ms. Coker. They, too, had no indications of any trouble.</p>
        <p>But during the last four days of her life, Caprice was repeatedly beaten with a stick by Ms. Coker's 49-year-old mother, a retired nurse, while Patricia Coker watched, according to court records released yesterday.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the day before she was found dead, Caprice was in so much pain from the beatings that she could not walk, the prosecutors said. She had diarrhea and a fever. But the records, which describe statements that Patricia Coker allegedly gave the police, say that Betty Coker continued to beat the child anyway.</p>
        <p>''She continued to beat Caprice day after day while Patricia Coker watched,'' said Jonathan Nelson, an assistant district attorney, during the arraignment of the two women on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Helen Wells, the lawyer who represents Patricia Coker, denied the allegations, saying her client was an excellent caretaker struggling to handle a difficult child.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wells said Caprice was so psychologically disturbed that she often banged her head against the wall, forcing the Cokers to tie her down.  And she said the girl, who had chicken pox, scratched herself, causing the bruises that covered her body.</p>
        <p>Gerald Harris, the deputy commissioner for legal services at the Administration for Children's Services, said in a statement that his accountability panel would determine exactly what went wrong.</p>
