        <p>An Australian archeologist and four Mexican colleagues who were reported missing in southern Mexico reappeared late Monday after swimming across a river to escape an attacking mob and hiking through the rain forest to safety.</p>
        <p>Peter Mathews, the archeologist, told reporters today in the town of Palenque in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas that he and his colleagues were surrounded and roughed up last Friday by villagers on the Usumacinta River along Mexico's border with Guatemala. The villagers were trying to prevent the removal of a Maya altar to a regional museum.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mathews and his colleagues fled by jumping into the river, swimming to the Guatemalan side, and hiking for three days. On Monday the crew of a riverboat ferried them to a border settlement, where they were picked up by Mexican officials.</p>
