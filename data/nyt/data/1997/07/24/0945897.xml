        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I enjoyed reading your paean to the Edsel (news article, July 22), I am disappointed you didn't mention that the Ford Motor Company enlisted the services of one of America's foremost poets in its quest for a suitably appealing name for the much-maligned automobile.</p>
        <p>For more than a year before the Edsel's unveiling, the Pulitzer-winning poet Marianne Moore submitted dozens of fanciful coinages for the new Ford vehicle, drawing them from sources as diverse as mythology, exotic birds, rare plant taxonomies and obscure historical allusions.</p>

        <p>For more than a year before the Edsel's unveiling, the Pulitzer-winning poet Marianne Moore submitted dozens of fanciful coinages for the new Ford vehicle, drawing them from sources as diverse as mythology, exotic birds, rare plant taxonomies and obscure historical allusions.</p>
        <p>Among her 40-odd suggestions: ''Turcotingo,'' ''Mongoose Civique,'' ''Dearborn Diamante,'' ''Varsity Stroke'' and ''Magigravure.'' Henry Ford, alas, rejected them all, preferring, of course, to name the vehicle after his only son.</p>
        <p>If Miss Moore's whimsy had been honored instead, the ''Utopian Tur tletop'' might have had a longer life span.</p>
        <p>EDWARD  MORAN</p>
        <p>Brooklyn, July 22, 1997</p>
        <p>Correction:  July 26, 1997, Saturday</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, a July 24 letter incorrectly stated whom the Edsel was named after. The automobile was named after the son of Henry Ford and the father of Henry Ford 2d.</p>
