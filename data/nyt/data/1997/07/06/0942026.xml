        <p>MINIMALISM is the buzzword of fashion, and designers and their sun-worshiping devotees are taking it literally. More than two-thirds of the women's swimwear market is still the tried-and-true one-piece tank, according to retailers, but the skimpy bikini, virtually invisible two years ago, has made a visible splash this season.</p>
        <p>At Saks Fifth Avenue, for one, that most reductive of suits -- the string bikini -- has accounted for 10 percent of swimsuit sales this year. In 1995, the store didn't even carry it.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the 1970's influences on runways, the low-riding, let-it-all-hang-out bikini, as barely worn by Britt Ekland in ''The Man With the Golden Gun'' (1974), has been revived by designers from Calvin Klein to Dolce &amp; Gabbana and by moderate lines like Sessa. Gucci has even introduced a thong this season for the first time.</p>
        <p>''Anything skimpy sold out,'' said Lisa Scheik, the spokeswoman for Gucci, which may have nudged the trend with its recent ad campaign picturing a man and a woman lying face down on a beach, buttocks bare save for a ''T'' of string held together by the Gucci logo. The thong ($120 for men, $225 for women) has sold out at Saks Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>''In the South, in California, all over, the string bikini is a best seller,'' said Nicole Fischelis, the fashion director of Saks, where popular styles include the kitschy tropical-print strings from Lilly Pulitzer and black minisuits from Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Calvin Klein says that this season it has sold more than 27,000 simple stretch-cotton string models priced at $76, 30 percent more than last year.</p>
        <p>At the beach in Southampton, N.Y., Jill Coronel, 28, a Manhattan marketing associate, has been wearing an aqua bikini with a string top and a brief bottom by the Italian designer Laura Urbinati that she picked up last month at Barneys New York.</p>
        <p>Wearing the season's look ''is so important,'' she said. ''When you go out at night in the Hamptons, you're judged in about two seconds by what you're wearing. It's the same at the beach.''</p>
        <p>''It's sexy without being tacky,'' she said of her choice. ''It does show exactly what your body is like, but if you're confident with that, you can pull it off.''</p>
        <p>The string bikini first became popular in this country in the 70's, when women seemed freer of concerns about achieving and maintaining a perfect body, and the dangers of the sun were not on a lot of people's minds. The bikini of the 80's, sans string, featured a higher cut to the leg and tighter-fitting fabrics like neoprene, which showed off an athletic body but was not flattering on most women. The last few years have seen the introduction of old-fashioned boy-cut or one-piece swimsuits designed to be more forgiving to a woman's figure.</p>
        <p>The string bikini walks a fine line: it can be worn as a badge of one-upsmanship for the ultrafit, but for the less toned, it does have that relaxed, 70's St.-Tropez look. ''What's funny is that the string bikini actually looks better on a woman who's more curvaceous,'' said Malia Mills, a young swimwear designer, who sells bikini tops and bottoms separately, for a better fit, at Saks, Barneys and Bergdorf Goodman. ''We call up modeling agencies for our photo shoots, and they send us over these six-foot twigs. We always have to call back and say, 'Send us women.'</p>
        <p>''And because it's kind of a cute style, the more womanly the figure, the better. If you have a girlish woman putting on a girlish style, it tends not to go as well.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mills said that lately, the more minimal her suits, the better they have been selling (a two-piece runs about $140). But most of her customers are going skimpy either on the top or the bottom, she said, adding, ''It takes a real sex kitten to put the tiny top and bottom together.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mills's more modest bikini styles, like those of other designers, include halter tops, underwires and high-waisted briefs.</p>
        <p>Even if the bikini doesn't project one's fantasy figure, said Katherine Betts, the fashion news director of Vogue, it can project confidence, or at the least insouciance. ''If you're comfortable with your body, then a bikini is sexy,'' she said, ''but if you're not, then no swimsuit is going to make you feel good. With other swimsuits that are supposed to hide imperfections, they can just highlight what you're trying to hide.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Betts added that minisuits were best left to women. ''On a guy, no,'' she said. She need not worry: the best-selling fashion for men this season is nylon surfer trunks.</p>
        <p>As for the thong, there have been few sightings -- on men or women -- at beaches this summer, which might lead one to speculate that Gucci's thongs are being enjoyed in private.</p>
        <p>Bergdorf Goodman Men did not even sell the item. ''We didn't go there,'' a salesman said with an air of Bergdorfian propriety. ''Which was a mistake, because every day we had people calling asking if we had it.''</p>
        <p>Bergdorf's does sell Gucci's brief-cut men's swimsuits, which are more modest than the thong but still racy, and they have not sold well. Part of the problem, the salesman said, is a design flaw that makes them better suited to women's physiques than to men's. ''There's no room,'' he said meaningfully.</p>
        <p>The suits are now on sale.</p>
