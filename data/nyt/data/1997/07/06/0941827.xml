        <p>NOT the old Spring Close House again. A half-dozen restaurants have been in and out of that East Hampton spot over the last decade and none of them has been better than mediocre. Now it is the Farmhouse and things are different.</p>
        <p>It even looks different. The sprawling white house set on lovely grounds is now beige with dark green accents. Floor to ceiling French doors and a striped market umbrella in front signal a new regime.</p>

        <p>NOT the old Spring Close House again. A half-dozen restaurants have been in and out of that East Hampton spot over the last decade and none of them has been better than mediocre. Now it is the Farmhouse and things are different.</p>
        <p>It even looks different. The sprawling white house set on lovely grounds is now beige with dark green accents. Floor to ceiling French doors and a striped market umbrella in front signal a new regime.</p>
        <p>The decor is a successful mix of whimsy, nostalgia, the barnyard and sophistication. At one end of the spectrum is a handsome, 1920's, dark-wood bar bedecked with Art Deco mirrors and graced with a cascading bouquet of flowers. In contrast are the canning-jars filled with artificial flowers on each table, wall-mounted heads of Laurel and Hardy, pigs and horses; wooden beams holding helter skelter crockery and yesteryear signs advertising old-line products including Breyers ice cream.</p>
        <p>The staff fits right in: warm, friendly, not too serious but usually on its toes. Reminders are sometimes needed for refills of bread and water.</p>
        <p>The bread is an assortment of chewy rolls, slices of sturdy Italian loaves and squares of somewhat dry, crumbly corn bread.</p>
        <p>Leading the appetizer roster is the bowl of local mussels in a terrific smoked tomato sauce with a topper of buttermilk onion rings. Those crunchy, lightly breaded rings are a must-order on their own, too ($4 as a side dish).</p>
        <p>Other superb starters are the Napoleon of layered eggplant caviar, olive tapenade and paper-thin focaccia toasts; the no-filler crab cake mated with a clump of mesclun salad and a drizzle of blueberry ketchup, the cured salmon served on a warm potato roesti and the oysters on the half shell topped with a fresh tomato-radish vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>The bistro salad is the one to order, with its appealing toss of greens, thin slices of pear, walnuts, wedges of beets, tangy blue cheese and just-slightly sweet maple-balsamic dressing. The mixed green salad is brought down by a too-sour lemon-herb vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Specials like crispy soft-shell crabs over a salad of frisee and mango, and pan-seared flaky yellowtail snapper set atop Oriental greens and roasted blue potatoes were head-turners. But so were the regular menu possibilities: lamb shank with a mound of mashed potatoes, sugar-snap peas and a tingle of mint oil, and meaty, tender, country-style ribs in a smoky barbecue sauce joined by tasty collard greens.</p>
        <p>The steak to order is the dry-aged, Black Angus rib eye that is both flavorful and tender. Its garnish of those wonderful onion rings is a bonus. The grilled onglet, (sliced hanger steak), was a bit chewy but still earned high marks in the taste department. Its skins-on French fries and red wine-shallot reduction helped.</p>
        <p>Lighter options are led by the rare tuna with crushed coriander crust and shaved fennel salad, and the perfectly turned out halibut atop mashed potatoes and leeks with a lemon-caper-olive relish encircling the plate.</p>
        <p>A bowl of assorted wild mushrooms -- some whole, some sliced -- tossed with homemade pasta, kept the winning streak going.</p>
        <p>Dessert is not as consistently successful as the other courses. The pear cobbler was sabotaged by undercooked fruit; the banana bread pudding could have been more moist, and the white chocolate mousse was soupy. But the creme brulee had an on-target satiny texture and the chocolate pudding, served in a classic martini glass, was a rich, dark delight. Homemade sorbets were mixed:  peach, mango and pink grapefruit passed muster.  Green apple with an applesauce texture did not.</p>
        <p>Although all but one of the entrees costs from $17 to $24, about three-quarters of the wines go for $30 or more a bottle. One of the few moderately priced reds is a solid though undistinguished 1995 Napa Ridge pinot noir ($24). A great white wine grape, largely ignored in the United States, is pinot gris and the 1995 Kings Estate version ($27) is ripe and creamy-textured with a crisp, rich finish.</p>
