        <p>A second black man alleged this week that he was abused by security personnel working at a branch of the Bloomingdale's chain, the Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>The man, Rashawn Carter, 23, said yesterday that he was beaten and handcuffed when he went to the store at Short Hills Mall in August 1995 to return a sweatshirt. While trying on possible replacements, Mr. Careter was confronted by two security guards and involved in a scuffle, said his lawyer, Leonard A. Weitzman, who showed reporters a security videotape of Mr. Carter being beaten.</p>

        <p>A second black man alleged this week that he was abused by security personnel working at a branch of the Bloomingdale's chain, the Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>The man, Rashawn Carter, 23, said yesterday that he was beaten and handcuffed when he went to the store at Short Hills Mall in August 1995 to return a sweatshirt. While trying on possible replacements, Mr. Careter was confronted by two security guards and involved in a scuffle, said his lawyer, Leonard A. Weitzman, who showed reporters a security videotape of Mr. Carter being beaten.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carter, who filed a civil rights lawsuit in State Superior Court last year against the company, said he decided to publicize his case after hearing that another man, Lloyd Morrison of Teaneck, had filed suit against the company last week, after he and his his 6-year-old son were wrongly accused of shoplifting and subjected to a strip search in the Hackensack store in 1996.</p>
        <p>A statement issued by Bloomingdale's said that Mr. Carter's tape ''provides only an incomplete picture of the situation.''</p>
