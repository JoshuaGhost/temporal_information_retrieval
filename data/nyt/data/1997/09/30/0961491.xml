        <p>Separation is the theme that overarches the sensitive, keenly observed and beautifully acted Argentine-Spanish film ''Martin (Hache).''</p>
        <p>Directed by Adolfo Aristarain from a screenplay he wrote with Kathy Saavedra, ''Martin (Hache),'' being shown at the New York Film Festival tomorrow at 9 P.M. and on Wednesday at 6 P.M., grapples unflinchingly with the separation of man from country, parent from child, lover from lover and friend from friend.</p>
        <p>For the four principal roles, Mr. Aristarain has found the perfect cast to tell his story: Federico Luppi as Martin, a divorced filmmaker also divorced from his emotions; Juan Diego Botto as his estranged son, known as Hache (equivalent to Junior); Cecilia Roth as Alicia, a film editor who is Martin's loving, long-suffering mistress, and especially in Eusebio Poncela as Dante, a life-devouring actor who is friend to all.</p>
        <p>From a historical perspective, ''Martin (Hache)'' can be perceived as a tale of ambivalence toward Argentina, given its bloody internal history in the 1970's and early 80's and the fact that Martin and, eventually, Hache are Argentines who have come to live in Madrid.</p>
        <p>But the broader appeal of the film grows out of its perceptive depiction of relationships. Martin, locked away from his emotions, is compelled to face fatherhood after five years of separation from his son when the 19-year-old Hache (called Jay, as in Junior, in the English subtitles), takes an accidental overdose of drugs and alcohol after his girlfriend rejects him in a Buenos Aires club.</p>
        <p>When this emergency compels Martin to return to Buenos Aires, his ex-wife, who has remarried, persuades him to take Hache back with him to Madrid -- permanently. ''He needs a father,'' she says. Hache is a young man adrift: no job, no school; only a casual affection for his guitar.</p>
        <p>In Madrid, Martin, who has been weighing the possibility of a return to directing, regards his son as an impediment to his solitary life; Dante, an old friend of the boy, greets him with delight and the affectionate wisdom of a thoroughly debauched guide, and Alicia is ready to accept him as a son, before Martin, in one of his characteristically hurtful outbursts, sends her away. The stage is set for ''Martin (Hache)'' to play itself out in Madrid and in the south of Spain, where Martin's buried emotions, harsh judgments and conflicted loyalties lead to tragedy.</p>
        <p>The film, which flags slightly toward its conclusion, is filled with intelligent talk among talented people and flashes with wit. Among its pleasures are jokes about the film industry, a sharp caricature of a producer, a diatribe addressed to a theater audience, some beautiful seaside scenery and, best of all, an unflinching eye for the complexities of human nature that make people both lovable and imperfect.</p>
        <p>MARTIN (HACHE)</p>
        <p>Directed by Adolfo Aristarain; written (in Spanish, with English subtitles) by Mr. Aristarain and Kathy Saavedra; director of photography, Porfirio Enriquez; edited by Fernando Pardo; music by Fito Paez; produced by Gerardo Herrero, Javier Lopez Blanco and Mr. Aristarain. Shown tonight at 9 P.M. and tomorrow at 6 P.M. at Alice Tully Hall, as part of the 35th New York Film Festival. Running time: 134 minutes. This film is not rated.</p>
        <p>WITH: Federico Luppi (Martin), Juan Diego Botto (Hache), Eusebio Poncela (Dante) and Cecilia Roth (Alicia).</p>
