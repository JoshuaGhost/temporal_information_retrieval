        <p>RESORT</p>
        <p>Like Old Times</p>
        <p>Cape May, at the southeastern tip of New Jersey, is like a living outdoor museum of vacationing, with its seaside Victorian mansions and giant old resorts. One of those resorts, which is under restoration, is providing a closer look at seaside hospitality over the years.</p>
        <p>Congress Hall -- built in 1816, rebuilt in 1879 and scheduled to reopen completely in 2000 -- offers 45-minute tours 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Thursday to Monday that include guest rooms decorated as they were in 1880, 1920 and 1950 (as well as a prototype of the new rooms). Tours cost $7. A wing with 22 shops is already open. Call (609) 884-8421.</p>
        <p>CRUISE</p>
        <p>A Lifeline for Investors</p>
        <p>Some go to sea to get away from it all; others want to stay on top of the investments that helped pay for the trip. For the latter, Silversea Cruises has Financial Fax, a daily personalized record that tracks up to 30 stocks, mutual funds and options, delivered to a guest at the close of markets. Available on the Silver Cloud and Silver Wind, the service costs $6 a day.</p>
        <p>For application forms, call Silverseas at (800) 722-9055. Guests who are hit by a severe market downturn are advised to keep their life jackets on.</p>
        <p>GUIDE</p>
        <p>Smoky London Town</p>
        <p>For those who don't mind some cigarette smoke mixed with the London fog, there is ''The Forest Guide to Smoking in London'' (Seven Hills Books, $12.95). It is a paperback that lists pubs, restaurants, hotels and sightseeing attractions that allow smoking and the limits they impose. Among its humorous touches is a guide to London's doorways, since that's where many smokers are likely to find themselves when they indulge. Call (800) 545-2005 to order ($3.50 extra for shipping).</p>
