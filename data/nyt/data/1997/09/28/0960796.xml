        <p>ALISON L. SMITH of Houston has recently added a ''sweet, playful dog'' to her household, so she and her husband are interested in a new form of travel -- one that takes them to places where dogs are welcome and their pet can ''freely run, explore, play and swim.''</p>
        <p>A friend of mine who recently took a two-week trip with her husband and children discovered with a shock that she should have budgeted $523 extra for the vacation: the cost of putting her cat in a kennel and getting the necessary booster shots for it to live in a communal setting.</p>

        <p>ALISON L. SMITH of Houston has recently added a ''sweet, playful dog'' to her household, so she and her husband are interested in a new form of travel -- one that takes them to places where dogs are welcome and their pet can ''freely run, explore, play and swim.''</p>
        <p>A friend of mine who recently took a two-week trip with her husband and children discovered with a shock that she should have budgeted $523 extra for the vacation: the cost of putting her cat in a kennel and getting the necessary booster shots for it to live in a communal setting.</p>
        <p>These two travelers evidently represent a rising population. Diana Wells, owner of Traveller's Bookstore in New York, said that in the last year and a half, the demand for information about places to stay with pets has increased sharply. The customers represent all types of people, but many are baby boomers. The A.A.A. also reports a big rise in the sale of its pet lodging directories.</p>
        <p>Interest is not confined to the motel crowd. The high-priced Relais &amp; Chateaux group recently took note of special attractions for pets at some of its places, including a dog masseur and ''Pawier'' water at $3 a bottle. Those welcoming pets in the United States were identified as the San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, Calif., the Little Nell in Aspen, Colo., the Old Drovers Inn in Dover Plains, N.Y., and the Point in Saranac Lake, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Most people traveling with pets take them in automobiles. Travel by air is governed by regulations of the airlines and the Department of Agriculture. As for trains, Amtrak does not permit pets aboard unless they are certified guide animals and the owner is carrying the documents; Greyhound has the same rule.</p>
        <p>Buckle Up</p>
        <p>The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals opposes letting animals roam loose in a car. Though two major books on travel with pets, a Frommer guide and the A.A.A.'s Pet Books, do not share that opposition, Jacque Schultz, director of companion animal services for the A.S.P.C.A., said using a carrier was particularly important with cats: ''You stop for gas and it's bye-bye kitty.''</p>
        <p>A cat, she said, should ride in a carrier, which should be held in place with the seat belt. The size of the carrier depends on the length of the trip. ''If the trip is going to be all day, the carrier should be big enough to contain a litter box and a towel. If it's only a three-hour trip, all that is needed is a towel or a diaper.'' A towel will absorb any urine.</p>
        <p>The handling of dogs depends on size. If the dog is small enough, Ms. Schultz said, having it ride in its crate is the safest method of travel, and again this should be held in place if possible with a seat belt. If the dog is too large, it should wear a special harness that attaches to the seat belts in the car. In the absence of a harness, Ms. Schulz recommends that the dog be put in its buckle collar -- not one that tightens under pulling -- with a leash attached. The dog should then sit or lie in the well of the back seat and a passenger should hold onto the leash so the dog is not thrown in a fast stop or accident. If the driver is alone, Ms. Schultz recommends that the leash be passed under the front seat and that the driver then sit on it, to keep dog and driver safe.</p>
        <p>Despite the many dogs that zip past, heads out, ears windswept, Ms. Schultz said it is not wise for a dog to ride this way: all sorts of grit can get in their eyes and ears.</p>
        <p>For a dark-colored animal in hot weather, she suggests the protective side-window shades that are used to safeguard children's skin. Owners should carry water for the pet from the tap at home, because different water may taste or smell strange.</p>
        <p>Pets should not be fed for three hours before a car trip, especially those that get queasy. They should not be allowed to tank up, although a little water is good. Humans need to take a break on a drive every two hours at least, which provides ample opportunity for most pets to get out in the air and walk, although ''bouncy adolescents'' or incontinent old pets may have special needs.</p>
        <p>On arrival, Ms. Schultz said, the pet should not be fed a meal immediately, but should have half an hour to settle down, perhaps with a few dog biscuits. ''You want to worry about their eating too fast and developing bloat.'' And it may not be easy to find a vet in a strange place.</p>
        <p>She said that most cities now have 24-hour veterinary service centers. If this or the Yellow Pages are no help, the American Animal Hospital Association, at (800) 883-6301, will try to find a nearby animal hospital or vet. This line operates weekdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M., Mountain time.</p>
        <p>Pet-Friendly Hotels</p>
        <p>For finding lodgings that accept pets, there are guides aplenty. The A.A.A. Pet Books, paperbacks that cover the United States and the adjoining provinces of Canada in four regional volumes, list 10,000 such places -- 2,500 each volume. These books are bare-bones computer-generated offshoots of the regular A.A.A. Tour Books for states, cities and regions. Unlike the regular guides, they contain no advertising and are printed in black and white. The 1997 revisions, the second edition, were recently issued and Jill Mross, a spokeswoman for the A.A.A., said that sales were 74 percent higher than for the first.</p>
        <p>Usually a listing includes name, telephone number, address, what type of pet is accepted and any damage deposit or extra charge involved, driving directions and then a line for rates and credit cards. Unless the family cares nothing about seasonally varying rates and amenities like swimming pools and restaurants, the pet guide should be used as an adjunct to the regular guide for the area. The regions covered are the Southeast, the Northeastern states and Canadian provinces, the central states and provinces, and the Western states and provinces.</p>
        <p>The Pet Books may be given away to members by a local auto club, as the Tour Guides are, or they may be sold. The price is given as $4.50 a volume. If it must be ordered from A.A.A. headquarters, the price is $5.50 a volume; the address is N. A. Daniels, 1000 A.A.A. Drive, Heathrow, Fla. 32746.</p>
        <p>Frommer's paperback series, ''On the Road Again With Man's Best Friend,'' by Dawn and Robert Habgood, is quite selective and includes some narrative of the sort that might help the well-heeled who seek dog recreation. In the recently revised California volume, for example, the entry for the San Ysidro Ranch says: ''Our two canines were quite happy to be back, eyeing the gum-ball machine filled with doggie treats while we signed them into the guest pet book.''</p>
        <p>The books in the Frommer series cover the Southeast, the Mid-Atlantic, New England, California and the Northwest. The price for ''California'' is $14.95.</p>
        <p>In all cases, people traveling with pets should call ahead. Because many people are severely allergic to animal dander, some lodgings restrict the rooms where pets are allowed and these may all be reserved.</p>
        <p>The London Mews Hilton, aware that Americans with dogs are probably lonesome while away from them, offers Pierre, its black spinger spaniel, for walks in nearby Hyde Park. The concierge, Martin Young, reports that Pierre receives cards and gifts from his guest walkers.</p>
