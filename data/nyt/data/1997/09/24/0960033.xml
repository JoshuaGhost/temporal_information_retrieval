        <p>Topics editorial deplores probe of leading human rights advocate Ivan Zvonimir Cicak as part of pattern of intimidation of independent activists by Croatian Pres Franjo Tudjman's Government (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>On the Croatian Government's list of its most bothersome citizens, Ivan Zvonimir Cicak ranks very high. Mr. Cicak, president of Croatia's Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, is the country's leading human rights advocate. Because Croatia's authoritarian President, Franjo Tudjman, has corrupted or intimidated much of his political opposition, Mr. Cicak's courage in criticizing government abuses is particularly important. So it is disturbing that prosecutors are now investigating Mr. Cicak on charges that he made false statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cicak made the statements to the Feral Tribune, a satirical weekly that is one of the few independent publications in Croatia. He discussed a meeting between Mr. Tudjman and the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 1991. Others present at the meeting have said that the two men laid the groundwork for the division of Bosnia. Mr. Cicak reiterated that view, which is widely held in Croatia.  He faces six months in jail if convicted. An opposition politician who said the same thing is being investigated as well.</p>

        <p>On the Croatian Government's list of its most bothersome citizens, Ivan Zvonimir Cicak ranks very high. Mr. Cicak, president of Croatia's Helsinki Committee for Human Rights, is the country's leading human rights advocate. Because Croatia's authoritarian President, Franjo Tudjman, has corrupted or intimidated much of his political opposition, Mr. Cicak's courage in criticizing government abuses is particularly important. So it is disturbing that prosecutors are now investigating Mr. Cicak on charges that he made false statements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cicak made the statements to the Feral Tribune, a satirical weekly that is one of the few independent publications in Croatia. He discussed a meeting between Mr. Tudjman and the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic in 1991. Others present at the meeting have said that the two men laid the groundwork for the division of Bosnia. Mr. Cicak reiterated that view, which is widely held in Croatia.  He faces six months in jail if convicted. An opposition politician who said the same thing is being investigated as well.</p>
        <p>The investigation of Mr. Cicak is part of a pattern of intimidation of Croatia's small group of independent activists. In July 1996 a bomb went off 20 yards from his summer house when it was full of sleeping children. The house of the Helsinki Committee's vice president was also attacked. The Government has indicted three officers of the Soros Foundation's Open Society Institute in Zagreb for allegedly falsifying financial records. The Open Society Institute in New York says that files in its New York computer were electronically searched in July by a computer in Croatia's defense ministry.</p>
        <p>The investigation of Mr. Cicak may be retribution for statements he made during a trip to Washington in June. When the Clinton Administration was rewarding Mr. Tudjman for his supposed tolerance for returning Serbian refugees, Mr. Cicak reminded it that Mr. Tudjman had in fact done little to protect the refugees or arrest their persecutors. Mr. Tudjman has long tarred anyone who criticizes him or stands up for the rights of minorities as anti-Croat.  Mr. Cicak, more than anyone else in Croatia, has fought for tolerance. To the Croatian Government, that is his real crime.</p>
