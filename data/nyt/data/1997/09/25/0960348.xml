        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Shenk's ''Life at Hyper-Speed'' (Op-Ed, Sept. 19) represents technophobic Ludditism born of scientific illiteracy. His premise that ''the amount of memory each chip can hold will double every nine months, instead of every 18 months'' and the resulting conclusion that ''processing speeds will increase at an even faster rate than before'' illustrate a striking ignorance of elementary mathematics and technology.</p>
        <p>That is because Intel has invented a one-time trick for doubling memory capacity that has little to do with the long-term exponential growth rate in memory density. Moreover, Intel's doubling trick applies to flash memory, a relatively arcane type of computer memory that finds only peripheral usage in the ordinary personal computer and doesn't imply a commensurate increase in consumer PC speed.</p>

        <p>We can hardly blame Intel for our own hectic life style decisions. The computer revolution, like any vehicle of technological change, has undoubtedly left some turbulence in its wake. However, the answer is not to close our eyes and decry the messenger.</p>
