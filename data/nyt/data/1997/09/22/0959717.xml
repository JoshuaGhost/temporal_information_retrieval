        <p>Hoping for leads in the search for the former head of the New Jersey Republican Party, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation handed out fliers yesterday in Washington Heights, where the missing man's car was found on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The man, Nelson G. Gross of Saddle River, N.J., was last seen Wednesday outside his family's floating restaurant on the Hudson riverfront in Edgewater, N.J. Family members said Mr. Gross had just withdrawn $20,000 from a bank and had driven off in the company of two unidentified men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gross's silver 1990 BMW sedan was found abandoned at 158th Street and Riverside Drive, a two-minute drive south of the George Washington Bridge, an investigator said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The fliers, given out to residents of the brick apartment buildings along Riverside Drive, advertise the $100,000 reward that Mr. Gross's family has offered for information leading to his safe return. The neighborhood is on a bluff that looks out across the river at the floating restaurant, the Binghamton Ferryboat.</p>
