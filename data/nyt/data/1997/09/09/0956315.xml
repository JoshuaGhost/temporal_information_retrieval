        <p>Charging that the American Medical Association ''is not above the law,'' the chairman of the Sunbeam Corporation, Albert J. Dunlap, filed suit yesterday on behalf of his company in an effort to force the medical group to honor its endorsement deal with the appliance manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Last month, under criticism, the A.M.A. did an about-face in little more than a week, announcing that it was abandoning its planned marketing alliance with Sunbeam, in which it would have exclusively endorsed the company's products for five years.</p>

        <p>Charging that the American Medical Association ''is not above the law,'' the chairman of the Sunbeam Corporation, Albert J. Dunlap, filed suit yesterday on behalf of his company in an effort to force the medical group to honor its endorsement deal with the appliance manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Last month, under criticism, the A.M.A. did an about-face in little more than a week, announcing that it was abandoning its planned marketing alliance with Sunbeam, in which it would have exclusively endorsed the company's products for five years.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Sunbeam sued in Federal court in Chicago to force the A.M.A. to honor its contract or pay damages ''that could exceed $20 million,'' Mr. Dunlap said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''They came to us; they pursued us; we negotiated for three months, and then we made an agreement,'' Mr. Dunlap said of the contract, which was signed on Aug. 5. ''How can they unilaterally say the contract is not binding? That's the height of absolute arrogance.''</p>
        <p>In a statement issued after the  announcement, Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, chairman of the A.M.A board of trustees, said of the endorsement deal that ''in the form executed, the agreement was a mistake.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''The board of trustees had neither reviewed nor approved the agreement, and it has now directed within two weeks of the agreement's execution that the A.M.A. not go forward with it.'' The organization declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>Last month the A.M.A. sought to abandon the Sunbeam deal, only a week after having publicly hailed the arrangement, the first such product-line endorsement by the A.M.A. in its 150-year history. It would have given a five-year, exclusive A.M.A. endorsement to Sunbeam products in nine home-care categories, including blood-pressure monitors, heating pads and vaporizers.</p>
        <p>Immediately the A.M.A. faced an outcry over conflict of interest and commercialism from consumer advocates, editorial writers, some of the group's 300,000 members and even some of its board members.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, in an apologetic Chicago news conference, Dr. P. John Seward, the organization's executive vice president, said that ''our credibility was called into question,'' adding that ''we take full responsibility for actions on our part that may have eroded our credibility.''</p>
        <p>Last month Dr. Seward asked Sunbeam to release the A.M.A. from its exclusivity agreement, saying that ''all who meet our standards in medicine should be eligible to participate in health-education partnerships with the A.M.A.'' And Dr. Seward also said that the A.M.A. would not accept royalty payments from Sunbeam, which had been estimated to be worth millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Sunbeam had said that it would be prepared to negotiate, but that no negotiations were ever conducted. Then, David Fannin, Sunbeam's general counsel, contended that the A.M.A. board met late last week, and voted to withdraw from the Sunbeam contract. He said the A.M.A. faxed a letter to Sunbeam on Saturday saying that ''the A.M.A. board had decided it would not honor the contract at all,'' Mr. Fannin said. He added that the fax was not received until yesterday, when the offices in Delray Beach, Fla., were open.</p>
        <p>''I thought that letter was totally outrageous,'' Mr. Dunlap said. A one-time West Point paratrooper, Mr. Dunlap, 60, is now known as Chainsaw Al for the way he has downsized companies. ''It's totally outside of contract law.''</p>
        <p>Analysts' opinions were mixed on the effect of the lawsuit on the image of the A.M.A. and Sunbeam. ''I don't see this as a publicity negative for Sunbeam,'' said Andrew Shore, a consumer-products analyst who follows Sunbeam for Paine Webber. ''Al Dunlap is saying a deal is a deal, and the A.M.A. should have thought about all of its considerations before it signed the contract.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Shore said he had ''no idea whether the suit will succeed,'' he added that Mr. Dunlap ''had no choice but to sue, if it was a valid contract.''</p>
        <p>Others said both parties would be tarnished. ''I don't think many people will have sympathy with the A.M.A., because it brought this situation on itself,'' said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.</p>
        <p>''But Sunbeam is continuing to play the heavy, and when consumers see Sunbeam products in the marketplace, they will immediately think of Sunbeam's heavy-handed approach. I think Sunbeam should shake the A.M.A.'s hand and try for another marketing deal.''</p>
        <p>The A.M.A. will have 20 days to respond to the lawsuit, filed yesterday in Federal District Court in Chicago. Eventually, a Federal judge will preside over a hearing. The judge could decide to enforce the contract or not. If the contract was not enforced, Sunbeam could be paid all or part of the $20 million in damages it says it is due. The value of the damages would have to be established in a hearing.</p>
        <p>To put $20 million in context, the A.M.A. spent $25 million on public-health campaigns over the last five years.</p>
