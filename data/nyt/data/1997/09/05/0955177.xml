      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The 17th annual CMJ Music Marathon sent a deliberate signal when it devoted its opening night concert, on Wednesday at Roseland, to electronica rather than its longtime staple, guitar-driven rock. It endorsed the music business's hope that music from computers, synthesizers and turntables will capture a mass audience the way grunge did in the early 1990's. And for most of the six-band bill, it showed that electronica groups are already starting to bend to rock expectations.</p>
        <p>It's an inevitable part of pop's evolutionary process. With mainstream audiences (and album sales) beckoning, electronica will produce groups willing to jettison whatever aspect of the music seems too avant-garde for listeners more used to rock. They are leaving behind the anonymity of the disk-jockey booth for showmanship, usually with lights and video effects to distract from the musicians themselves, intent on their keyboards. Groups are breaking continuous, open-ended sets into song-length segments, adding vocal refrains or clear-cut verses and choruses. Others are trading multilayered syncopation for more basic rock rhythms.  Meanwhile, rock songwriters are stealing all they can from electronica.</p>

        <p>The 17th annual CMJ Music Marathon sent a deliberate signal when it devoted its opening night concert, on Wednesday at Roseland, to electronica rather than its longtime staple, guitar-driven rock. It endorsed the music business's hope that music from computers, synthesizers and turntables will capture a mass audience the way grunge did in the early 1990's. And for most of the six-band bill, it showed that electronica groups are already starting to bend to rock expectations.</p>
        <p>It's an inevitable part of pop's evolutionary process. With mainstream audiences (and album sales) beckoning, electronica will produce groups willing to jettison whatever aspect of the music seems too avant-garde for listeners more used to rock. They are leaving behind the anonymity of the disk-jockey booth for showmanship, usually with lights and video effects to distract from the musicians themselves, intent on their keyboards. Groups are breaking continuous, open-ended sets into song-length segments, adding vocal refrains or clear-cut verses and choruses. Others are trading multilayered syncopation for more basic rock rhythms.  Meanwhile, rock songwriters are stealing all they can from electronica.</p>
        <p>The concert included four guitarless acts -- Aphex Twin, Crystal Method, Daft Punk and Fluke -- along with two groups mixing machinery with conventional instruments, Sneaker Pimps and Death in Vegas. Between sets, disk jockeys sought to stir a crowd more interested in conversation than dancing; not even Robert James's dizzying 2 A.M. techno set, filled with melodic hooks and rip-snorting effects, could mobilize them.</p>
        <p>Crystal Method and Daft Punk, both duos, made electronica that a rock audience could savor: steady, aggressive and not too complicated, moving in reliable four-bar patterns as old as the blues. Crystal Method placed a driving midtempo beat and octave-hopping bass lines under layers of twitchy syncopations, sustained tones and swooping, sirenlike glissandos. Within the propulsion, there were clear structures. The music pulsated, built, crested and then started its next ascent; peaks arrived exactly when expected, but with a satisfying impact. Crystal Method records for a major label (Outpost/Universal), and had stage effects to prove it: columns of strobe lights and a smoke machine that fogged the whole club.</p>
        <p>Daft Punk's music was starker and simpler. Again and again, its music reverted to a basic four-beat thump, and Daft Punk rarely added much atop it: one more subdivision of the beat, perhaps, with a keyboard riff attached. The boom-chunk patterns sometimes harked back to 1980's Chicago house music and sometimes suggested Queen's ''We Will Rock You.'' By slowing down and then speeding up the beat, Daft Punk drew shouts of approval, whipping up the crowd with the bluntness of a heavy-metal drum solo.</p>
        <p>Fluke, with two vocalists (a growling man and a perky woman), a disk jockey and a keyboardist, reshapes its electronica like hip-hop and dance hall reggae. Amid quacking, snorting synthesizer hooks and bouncing-bedspring rhythms, the vocalists rapped and posed and danced; the music improved when they were silent.</p>
        <p>The Sneaker Pimps were out of place on the bill; they are a rock band accessorized with trip-hop. Slow bass vamps and stuttering drums carry Kelli Dayton's light, taunting voice while she sings about, as one song title puts it, ''Post Modern Sleaze.'' The verses mimic the cool of bands like Portishead; the choruses hedge their bets, as Liam Howe's guitar kicks in with grungelike power chords. On stage, the Sneaker Pimps sounded like a marketing concept: trip-hop grunge.</p>
        <p>Death in Vegas tried, awkwardly, to fuse instrumental rock and electronica, aspiring to be Booker T. and the PC's. Two electronics players with a guitarist and a bassist played genre exercises in reggae, hard rock, funk and techno, cycling through their sections but not going anywhere.</p>
        <p>Aphex Twin, Richard D. James's one-man band, held on to the avant-garde promise of electronica. In his set, rhythms didn't always sound like drums, textures could trump melodies, sounds weren't always pretty and pieces veered at will. There were fast, ratcheting rhythms and hovering sustained chords; there were salvos of stereo zaps and random chirps. Mr. James (who is not related to Robert James, the disk jockey) worked up to hyperspeed, then collapsed the beat and attacked from a new angle. One piece was built on a sustained low note that sounded like a foghorn or a didjeridoo, topped with jawharp-like twangs and synthetic crickets, making the room throb and crackle. Mr. James showed that electronica can be abstract, improvisational, startling, even dangerous. And for those who wanted rock showmanship, two oversize teddy bears arrived on stage, cavorting and wrestling by turns.</p>
