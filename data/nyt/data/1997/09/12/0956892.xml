        <p>Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called on Israel today to refrain from actions the Palestinians find provocative, and urged a ''time out'' on settlement activity.</p>
        <p>In an unusually pointed and specific speech, Ms. Albright listed some of the steps America wants Israel to take to revive the stalled peace negotiations and drew an immediate objection from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman, who said that settlement expansion could not be stopped.</p>
        <p>''Israel should refrain from unilateral acts including what Palestinians perceive as the provocative expansion of settlements, land confiscation, home demolitions, and confiscation of I.D.'s,'' Ms. Albright said in a televised speech to high-school students here.</p>
        <p>''We believe that a time-out from these kind of unilateral actions will create a climate'' in which accelerated negotiations ''can succeed in achieving a final Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement,'' she said.</p>
        <p>These are not new American positions, both American and Israeli officials said tonight, and they have been expressed to Mr. Netanyahu in private. ''What is new, and surprising, is that she made them public,'' a senior Israeli official said. ''It now puts pressure on us to answer. It puts the ball in the Israeli court.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright spent the first day of her trip underscoring American support for Israel and sympathy for its view that the Palestinians have not done enough to guarantee security.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright met today with the  Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat, in the West Bank town of Ramallah. She said afterward that he had to make a much harder and sustained effort to crack down on terrorism to boost Israeli confidence, and had promised her he would do so.</p>
        <p>But the Israelis must also stop humiliating the Palestinians, she said. And for the first time in public, she listed some of the specifics of what she wanted the Israelis to do.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright did not describe her speech to Mr. Netanyahu in advance,  American officials said, although it was cleared in Washington and was being fine-tuned nearly until delivery. Mr. Netanyahu immediately objected to the call on halting settlement expansion, with his spokesman, David Bar-Illan, saying: ''She's talking of the future, and right now we have to concentrate on stopping terrorism.'' In any event, he said: ''You can't ask us to stop expanding existing settlements, which are living organisms.''</p>
        <p>Another Israeli official said: ''She asks that Israel stop anything the Palestinians regard as provocative. What will they think is provocative tomorrow?''</p>
        <p>While Labor Governments have also expanded existing settlements and the Oslo accords do not limit them from doing so, the Palestinians have complained that Israel now builds large new neighborhoods near existing settlements in order to call them expansion, rather than label them new.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, Ms. Albright said that substantive progress on peace was hard to find. ''So far we have managed to get agreement on the fact that terrorists are terrible but we have not, I think, yet been able to see what the best methods are to get the peace process back on track,'' she said. ''I think I still have a great deal more work to do.''</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said that they expected the American envoy, Dennis Ross, to return in a week or so to build on the Albright mission, but American officials said no final decision had been made on such a trip.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright, while repeating the primacy of security and the need for Mr. Arafat to show a ''comprehensive, relentless and sustained'' effort to stop terrorists, also had tough criticism for Mr. Netanyahu even on his own efforts to enhance Israeli security.</p>
        <p>With candor rare in diplomacy, she said in Ramallah that ''it is beyond my understanding'' how Israel's decision to withhold millions of dollars of taxes it owes to the Palestinian Authority could be a security measure, as Mr. Netanyahu insists.</p>
        <p>The money represents about 60 percent of the Palestinian Authority's annual budget, and to withhold it, she said, ''makes it more difficult to have the kind of political environment'' necessary for Israeli-Palestinian partnership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu has previously released about a third of the tax money, and a senior Israeli official said tonight, after the Albright speech, that another large amount would be released ''in a few days'' if Mr. Arafat makes some move to crack down on radical groups like Hamas and Islamic Holy War.</p>
        <p>In reciprocity, the official said, Mr. Netanyahu would also move to ease restrictions on Palestinian travel in and out of the West Bank, including the movement of more Palestinian goods like fruit, flowers and vegetables -- but not cement, which the official said the Palestinians were using to build a Gaza seaport Israel had not yet agreed to allow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu had also asked Ms. Albright to ask Mr. Arafat's help to find a missing Israeli believed to have been kidnapped, and Mr. Arafat promised today to help, officials said.</p>
        <p>At their joint news conference, Mr. Arafat said he was satisfied with Ms. Albright and the American role and said: ''We do not believe in violence or terrorism. We reject it.'' He said that ''the Palestinian Authority is committed to all its responsibilities and I hope the Israeli Government will do the same.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright, at the news conference, expressed sympathy for Palestinian feelings. ''These have not been easy years,'' she said. ''The Palestinians have suffered a great deal, including the human costs of closures, on restrictions on movement and of housing demolitions and land confiscations.'' She added: ''Your frustrations are understandable. This is not what peace was supposed to bring.''</p>
        <p>American officials said that Ms. Albright's strategy, in the atmosphere following two devastating suicide bombings in Jerusalem, has had to consist of sequential steps: reassure the Israelis about American support for their state and its security; reinforce Israeli demands that Mr. Arafat fight terrorism in a serious, sustained and uncompromising way; make it clear to Mr. Arafat that only when Washington is satisfied on terrorism can she possibly move to discuss political issues in a serious way with Mr. Netanyahu; get a commitment from Mr. Arafat ''to do what needs to be done''; monitor that commitment; remind Mr. Netanyahu that ''the fight against terrorism is a necessary but not sufficient condition to move forward''; insist that Mr. Netanyahu keep to the Oslo accords and their troop withdrawals from the West Bank; and, finally, chide both sides for their failures to work together and treat each other with respect.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright's speech tonight was an effort to push Mr. Netanyahu to do the last, officials said. Because to get to the accelerated talks on a final settlement between the Israelis and Palestinians, one official said, ''both sides need to have a lot more confidence and trust in each other than they do right now, and right now they don't have very much.''</p>
