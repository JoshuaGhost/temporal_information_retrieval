        <p>Like two boxers preparing for a bout,  Ruth W. Messinger and the Rev.

        <p>Like two boxers preparing for a bout,  Ruth W. Messinger and the Rev. Al Sharpton eyed and circled each other yesterday on the steps of a Bronx elementary school  with stern looks and grim smiles. But they did not say a word to each other, even as they competed with strong blasts of populist  rhetoric before a crowd of parents angry over school overcrowding.</p>
        <p>Both candidates were trying to appeal to the same constituency of mostly disadvantaged Hispanic and black parents, many of whom said they were still undecided about who should be mayor but preferred either of the two Democrats over Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. It was the first time the two candidates had publicly come together since their standoff in Tuesday's primary, but both preferred to pretend that their only competition came from the Republican incumbent in City Hall.</p>
        <p>Speaking first before a crowd of about 200 parents and children at Public School 33 on Jerome Avenue, Ms. Messinger showed off  her reasonably comfortable command of Spanish. ''Gracias, buenos tardes, amigos,'' she began, before switching to English and attacking the Giuliani administration for ''taking $6 billion out of the schools.'' As mayor, she said, she would build more schools and make sure no class was over 25 students.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton did not try to stumble over a foreign tongue, but not to be outdone, he immediately promised that if he was elected, no class would have more than 20 students. Calling many of the classrooms in poor neighborhoods ''glorified outhouses,'' he said, ''There is city property in these neighborhoods that can be opened right now if we have the will.''</p>
        <p>But as Mr. Sharpton sought to focus his attention on education, he spent much of yesterday fielding questions about his financial affairs, in particular the thousands of dollars in taxes that the state and Federal Governments say he owes.</p>
        <p>The Daily News reported yesterday that he owed more than $100,000 in Federal and state taxes and penalties.</p>
        <p>In a news conference in his midtown office, Mr. Sharpton said that he had been negotiating with state tax officials to arrive on a figure of the amount of taxes and penalties he owed for the period from 1989 to 1993. But he said that all his taxes had been paid since 1993.</p>
        <p>And on the Republican side of the mayoral race, Mr. Giuliani's campaign got doses of both good and bad news. The city's Campaign Finance Board accused the Mayor's re-election campaign of accepting more than $400,000 in illegal donations and said it would suspend the payment of matching funds until it gives back the disputed donations or submits evidence documenting that they are not illegal.</p>
        <p>The good news came from Stanley Hill, the leader of the city's largest union of municipal workers. At a City Hall ceremony Mr. Hill endorsed the Mayor, saying that his 120,000-member union -- normally a Democratic ally -- felt that Mr. Giuliani had treated the union well and lived up to his pledge to avoid union layoffs.</p>
        <p>The steps of P.S. 33 served as a perfect backdrop for both Mr. Sharpton and Ms. Messinger, who are struggling to convince the voters that all is not well in Mayor Giuliani's New York. The metal bars covering broken windows appeared especially out of place next to the school's beautiful gothic trim and sculptured facade.</p>
        <p>And as the two candidates studiously guarded against making any eye contact, parent after parent complained of kindergarten classes with more than 30 students and the fears they felt sending off their children in buses without seat belts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Messinger, who was forced into the runoff campaign when she failed to achieve 40 percent of the vote in the Tuesday primary, arrived an hour before the Mr. Sharpton. She used the extra time to walk with the parents and students about a half mile through the graffiti-splashed streets of the Kingsbridge section, marching arm in arm with two young girls. She seemed especially to enjoy practicing her Spanish, waving her aides away when they asked her to speed up an interview with a Spanish-language television reporter.</p>
        <p>''We need a mayor who will pay as much attention to 195th Street in the northwest Bronx as to Wall Street,'' she said. Speaking to a group of mothers, she asked, ''Do you want smaller classes? Sounds good to me. I'm ready to march.''</p>
        <p>In comments to reporters, she shrugged off the news of Mr. Hill's endorsement, saying, ''I think the municipal unions are under a lot of pressure.'' She also said the announcement was not surprising, and took a jab at Mr. Hill. ''This is a union leader who also agreed to a contract that said his members should have no wage increases in the first two years,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Sharpton's tax problems, she was a bit more subtle. ''Taxes owed to Federal, state or city government ought to be paid,'' she said, flashing a smile.</p>
        <p>But by not speaking of Mr. Sharpton by name, Ms. Messinger was keeping to a strategy of trying to avoid a grudge match with a candidate whose support her aides say she will need to defeat Mr. Giuliani in November. Mr. Sharpton returned the favor and did not attack her.</p>
        <p>Talking to reporters, Mr. Sharpton  said education would be a hallmark of his administration. ''The attitude of this administration to public education has been so low it borders on contemptuous,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But throughout the day, Mr. Sharpton was confronted with questions about his taxes. He characterized the matter as ''old news,'' adding that the questions were being used to embarrass him at a time when his campaign had gained momentum.</p>
        <p>''Clearly this is a political pattern,'' Mr. Sharpton said, comparing his problems to financial questions raised during the campaigns of former Mayor David N. Dinkins, Jesse L. Jackson and Harold Washington, the late Mayor of Chicago.</p>
        <p>He even sought to make light of the issue. ''I'm glad it happened,'' he said. ''The phones have been ringing off the hook with people who want to help pay tax bills. I've asked them to donate that to the campaign. Anyone who has ever had a battle with the I.R.S., I'm inviting to vote for me, because I know how you feel.''</p>
        <p>And in a rally last night he sought to turn it to his political advantage, telling hundreds of cheering supporters in Harlem that the reports would only serve to energize voters. ''They went and found some old penalties and put it on a new front page,'' he said to laughter and cheers. ''They will try every angle not knowing that all these angles galvanize our base.''</p>
        <p>The dispute stems from tax problems that began in 1989, when Mr. Sharpton faced a 67-count indictment on charges that he stole $250,000 from charitable donors and cheated on his income taxes. He was ultimately acquitted of all counts. (However he pleaded guilty in 1993 to an unrelated misdemeanor charge of failing to file a return in 1986; he was fined $5,000.)</p>
        <p>After the acquittal his tax problems lingered, centering on a dispute over how much he owed for the years from 1989, when the indictments came, and 1993, when he was acquitted. The Internal Revenue Service has filed liens totaling $80,004 against Mr. Sharpton, while the state's tax department filed liens totaling $27,664. Michael A. Hardy, Mr. Sharpton's lawyer, said that most of the taxes for the four years had been paid, that the amount of the penalties was the matter in dispute.</p>
        <p>''They tried to give me penalties on taxes that we argued we did not owe,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''The state is in negotiation with my accountant,'' he added, saying he expected a settlement in the next week or two. He said he had set aside money for his payment. ''We're talking about a dispute over numbers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 13, 1997, Saturday</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, an article on the front page of front-page article in The Metro Section yesterday about the New York City mayoral race misstated the total of illegal campaign contributions that the re-election campaign of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has been accused of accepting. As noted in a related article in the section, it was more than $300,000, not more than $400,000.</p>
