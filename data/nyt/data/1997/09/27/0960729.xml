        <p>The Plasma Physics Laboratory at Princeton University was forced to shut down its Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor earlier this year and lay off 35 workers because of declining congressional support. But the lab will get enough Federal financing during the coming year to avoid further cuts, officials at the lab said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''It's extremely good news,'' said Rich Hawrlyuk, deputy director of the lab.</p>
        <p>House and Senate conferees in Washington agreed to spend $232 million for the United States Department of Energy's magnetic fusion program -- the same amount as last year -- but some of it will be redirected toward the construction of a smaller, more economical reactor at Princeton, Mr. Hawrlyuk said.</p>
        <p>The Tokamak reactor had achieved the world's highest controlled yield of fusion energy, but drew criticism from lawmakers who said it was inefficient.</p>
