        <p>This is how badly Joe Torre wanted yesterday's game: with the Yankees leading Montreal by a run in the eighth inning, he hurried his closer, Mariano Rivera, into the middle of an at-bat.</p>
        <p>Rivera replaced Mike Stanton with two outs, two runners on and a 2-1 count on the Expos' Jose Vidro. He walked Vidro to load the bases, but struck out pinch-hitter Darrin Fletcher to leave them loaded. And then Rivera struck out Mike Lansing with a runner on in the ninth to secure his 40th save and a 3-2 victory at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Before a full house of 55,707 on Don Mattingly Day, the Yankees snapped a three-game losing streak and crept back within six and a half games of the Baltimore Orioles, who lost to the Mets, in the American League East. The Yankees and the Orioles will face each other eight more times, all in the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>''This game was big,'' Rivera said. ''We needed this game. I wasn't expecting for him to call on me in the eighth. I was throwing for the ninth until we got in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Torre, who said Rivera would have come in for Vidro's entire at-bat had he been ready, did everything he could to buy time for Rivera to warm up. After Stanton threw a ball on his first pitch to Vidro -- which brought on pro-Rivera chants of ''We want Mo!'' -- Torre sent first baseman Tino Martinez to the mound for an impromptu conference.</p>
        <p>''I was just trying to get him ready and 2 and 1 was the earliest we were able to do it,'' Torre said. ''I just wanted to get him in there, even though I didn't want to get him in there in the eighth.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees had taken a 3-0 lead into the eighth on a first-inning wild pitch, a homer by Bernie Williams in the third and Rey Sanchez's run-scoring single in the seventh. But Andy Pettitte (16-7) was tiring, even though he had allowed just four hits through seven shutout innings.</p>
        <p>''I felt terrible from pitch one,'' said Pettitte, who was annoyed that the game was delayed for about half an hour because of the pre-game festivities. ''I was scuffling the whole time with my command. And my body kind of won out over my mind in the eighth inning.''</p>
        <p>The Expos' No. 9 hitter, Doug Strange, led off the inning by lining a single up the middle. Torre, at that point trying to buy time for Jeff Nelson to warm up, signaled for two pickoff attempts. On the second, Pettitte recorded his major league-leading 13th pickoff of the year.</p>
        <p>''We were basically throwing to first base until we got Nellie ready, and he winds up picking him off,'' Torre said. ''So I gave him another hitter.''</p>
        <p>But Pettitte fell behind Mark Grudzielanek, 3-0, before the Montreal shortstop singled to center on a 3-1 pitch. That was all for Pettitte.</p>
        <p>Grudzielanek stole second and took third on Mike Lansing's single to left. Nelson struck out Vladimir Guerrero on an 0-2 slider for the second out, but Torre brought in Stanton so the switch-hitting David Segui would bat from the right side.</p>
        <p>The strategy backfired, however. Stanton, who later admitted he had nothing on his pitches, walked Segui on five of them to load the bases. Rondell White delivered a two-strike, two-run single. And that's when Rivera began warming up in earnest.</p>
        <p>Rivera, by the way, did not mind.</p>
        <p>''It's my job,'' he said. ''I have to do it. I like it, too.''</p>
        <p>Probably not as much as Torre liked the results.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>HIDEKI IRABU's assignment in Philadelphia this afternoon will not be an easy one. The Phillies are 32 games under .500, but they have won 20 of their last 30 games and their ace, CURT SCHILLING (13-10, 2.92 earned run average), will be on the mound. Irabu will also be batting for the first time in the interleague game. JOE TORRE said, ''I hope he goes 0 for 3, which means he pitched a long time.'' . . . The Yankees are the first team to have two pitchers reach the 40-save mark in consecutive seasons. JOHN WETTELAND led the American League last year with 43 saves, and MARIANO RIVERA got his 40th yesterday. . . . DAVID CONE threw 35 pitches off a mound yesterday and said it went well. Cone, who is on the disabled list with shoulder tendinitis, is eligible to come off tomorrow but said he will probably throw a simulated game instead and possibly start on Sunday against the Orioles. . . . The Yankees will probably recall outfielder SCOTT POSE, and possibly the right-hander WILLIE BANKS, when rosters expand to 40 today. Torre is expecting Cone, PAT KELLY and CECIL FIELDER to come off the disabled list this month, although Kelly is experiencing recurring soreness in his right foot. Torre said it is doubtful that LUIS SOJO (left forearm fracture) will make it back this year. . . . CHARLIE HAYES, who has a viral throat infection, missed his third consecutive game. ''I'm just going to wait for Charlie to come in and say he feels all right,'' Torre said.</p>
