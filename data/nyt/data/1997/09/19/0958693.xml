        <p>The Friends and Enemies of New Music generally offer concerts of contemporary chamber music, but having already devoted evenings to solo piano and solo violin works, the organization opened its season on Wednesday evening, at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, with what it called a Guitarathon. It was a sensible idea: there may be more first-rate guitarists per capita in New York City than anywhere else in the United States, and since the cream of the repertory is modern, most guitarists are experienced and devoted new-music players.</p>
        <p>Quite a few are also composers, and of the seven guitarists who performed on Wednesday, three offered works of their own. The most fascinating of these was a pair of frenetic and extraordinarily colorful percussion studies, subtitled ''Dancas Percussivas,'' by Arthur Kampela.</p>

        <p>The Friends and Enemies of New Music generally offer concerts of contemporary chamber music, but having already devoted evenings to solo piano and solo violin works, the organization opened its season on Wednesday evening, at Christ and St. Stephen's Church, with what it called a Guitarathon. It was a sensible idea: there may be more first-rate guitarists per capita in New York City than anywhere else in the United States, and since the cream of the repertory is modern, most guitarists are experienced and devoted new-music players.</p>
        <p>Quite a few are also composers, and of the seven guitarists who performed on Wednesday, three offered works of their own. The most fascinating of these was a pair of frenetic and extraordinarily colorful percussion studies, subtitled ''Dancas Percussivas,'' by Arthur Kampela.</p>
        <p>Orthodox guitar technique allows for a variety of percussive effects, but Mr. Kampela went well beyond these, adding an arsenal of fingernail tapping and string snapping, scraping and popping techniques. He also used a pencil, to slide along the strings, and a spoon, to create a wobbly effect that allowed his unamplified instrument to sound as though it were being played through an electronic-effects processor.</p>
        <p>The effects themselves would not have added up to much if the writing between them had been less compelling. Mr. Kampela has a sense of humor as well as an ironclad technique that is clearly influenced by rock, particularly certain of the more histrionic heavy-metal players, and it seemed only natural that someone so imaginative might find the standard guitar repertory constricting.</p>
        <p>Arturo Martinez took a more traditional view in his ''Su Nina Julia,'' an attractive work with flamenco roots. Composers who perform tend to write to their strengths, and Mr. Martinez's include the speed and precision that made his often showy passage work sound dazzling.</p>
        <p>The third composer-player, Ben Yarmolinsky, offered ''Mobiles,'' an easygoing work in which a gentle melody floated over a repeating arpeggio figure. Not a lot happens in it; at times it had a meandering, New Age quality.</p>
        <p>Of the guitarists who played others' works, the most gripping performances were by Jorge Caballero, who brought a remarkable fluidity, in both phrasing and dynamics, to Hector Tosar's densely harmonized ''Gandhara,'' and Orin Fader, who gave a vibrant account of the most familiar work on the program, John Anthony Lennon's ''Another's Fandango.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fader and William Anderson joined forces for Milton Babbitt's pointillistic ''Soli e Duettini,'' and Mr. Anderson offered Robert Pollack's ''Metaphor,'' a work that drew on both traditional Spanish influences and more up-to-date harmonic notions. Thea Musgrave's ''Postcards from Spain,'' played by Michael Lorimer, might have stood out in a concert of settled guitar chestnuts, but in this varied and often experimental company it seemed a staidly conventional tour of standard guitar moves.</p>
