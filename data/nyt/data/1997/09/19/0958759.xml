        <p>Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger is now the official Democratic mayoral nominee. Ms. Messinger has been gearing her career toward that prize for nearly a decade, but she certainly never expected to win it by such a narrow margin amid so much confusion.</p>
        <p>The Board of Elections' official count showed that Ms. Messinger had received about 800 votes more than the necessary 40 percent of the vote total to nail down the nomination. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who had hoped for a runoff, has gone to court to challenge the results. Given the fact that Mr. Sharpton and his followers were allowed to believe for almost a week that he would be meeting Ms. Messinger in a runoff, he deserves any reasonable reassurance that the results were accurate.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Sharpton has no right to a runoff unless he can show evidence that there was fraud, or that the count was somehow flawed. The original confusion was due to mistakes in the unofficial system of reporting election results by the Associated Press. The Board of Elections has done only one official count and it shows Ms. Messinger as the winner. If the situations were reversed, Mr. Sharpton would certainly challenge anyone who said he should be forced to jump additional hurdles to win the nomination because his margin of victory was small.</p>
        <p>Ms. Messinger's campaign has been dogged by problems, many of her own making. But the confusion over the election results is not one of them. Mr. Sharpton has repeatedly said that he does not blame Ms. Messinger for his loss of an opportunity for a runoff, and stressed that his primary goal is Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's defeat. He knows that a drawn-out fight over the primary results would undermine that goal.</p>
        <p>While the people involved may not feel it now, this week's political chaos had positive aspects. It directed attention to the archaic Board of Elections, whose operations will be improved only if the public demands it. It also gave Mr. Sharpton, who wants very much to be regarded as a legitimate political player, a chance to demonstrate that he can be responsible when faced with unexpected and disappointing reverses.</p>
        <p>Ms. Messinger, in hindsight, made a wise choice when she decided to debate Mr. Sharpton only on policy issues and not his own qualifications to be mayor. Her desire not to antagonize Mr. Sharpton's supporters was obviously political. But once the primary results were thrown into question and Mr. Sharpton's supporters began asking if they had been robbed, the city was well served by the atmosphere of amity and respect the two candidates built up during their brief runoff campaign.</p>
