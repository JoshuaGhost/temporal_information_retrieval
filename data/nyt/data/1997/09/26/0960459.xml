        <p>Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech today commemorating the 40th anniversary of the desegregation of Central High School, as recorded by the Federal Document Clearing House, a private transcription service:</p>
        <p>Forty years ago, a single image first seared the heart and stirred the conscience of our nation.</p>
        <p>So powerful, most of us who saw it then recall it still. A 15-year-old girl, wearing a crisp black and white dress, carrying only a notebook, surrounded by large crowds of boys and girls, men and women, soldiers and police officers. Her head held high, her eyes fixed straight ahead. And she is utterly alone.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 4, 1957, Elizabeth Eckford walked through this door for her first day of school, utterly alone. She was turned away by people who were afraid of change, instructed by ignorance, hating what they simply could not understand.</p>
        <p>And America saw her haunted and taunted for the simple color of her skin. And in the image, we caught a very disturbing glimpse of ourselves.</p>
        <p>We saw not one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, but two Americas, divided and unequal. What happened here changed the course of our country forever.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Eckford, along with her eight schoolmates, were turned away on Sept. 4, but the Little Rock Nine did not turn back.</p>
        <p>Forty years ago today, they climbed these steps, passed through this door and moved our nation. And for that, we must all thank them. . . .</p>
        <p>Most of those who just watched these events unfold can never understand fully the sacrifice they made. Imagine, all of you, what it would be like to come to school one day and be shoved against lockers, tripped down stairways, taunted day after day by your classmates, to go all through school with no hope of going to a school play or being on a basketball team, or learning in simple peace. . . .</p>
        <p>Forty years later, what do you young people in this audience believe we have learned? . . .</p>
        <p>Forty years later, we know the question of race is more complex and more important than ever, embracing no longer just blacks and whites, or blacks and whites and Hispanics and Native Americans, but now people from all parts of the earth coming here to redeem the promise of America.</p>
        <p>Forty years later, frankly, we know we are bound to come back where we started.  After all the weary years and silent tears, after all the stony roads and bitter rods, the question of race is, in the end, still an affair of the heart. . . .</p>
        <p>And what are the facts?</p>
        <p>It is a fact, my fellow Americans, that there are still too many places where opportunity for education and work are not equal, where disintegration of family and neighborhood make it more difficult.</p>
        <p>But it is also a fact that schools and neighborhoods and lives can be turned around, if -- but only if -- we are prepared to do what it takes. It is a fact that there are still too many places where our children die or give up before they bloom, where they are trapped in a web of crime and violence and drugs.</p>
        <p>But we know this, too, can be changed, but only if we are prepared to do what it takes.  Today, children of every race walk through the same door, but then they often walk down different halls.</p>
        <p>Not only in this school but across America, they sit in different classrooms, they eat at different tables. They even sit in different parts of the bleachers at the football game.  Far too many communities are all white, all black, all Latino, all Asian.</p>
        <p>Indeed, too many Americans of all races have actually begun to give up on the idea of integration and the search for common ground. For the first time since the 1950's, our schools in America are resegregating.</p>
        <p>The rollback of affirmative action is slamming shut the doors of higher education on a new generation, while those who oppose have not yet put forward any other alternative.</p>
        <p>In so many ways, we still hold ourselves back. We retreat into the comfortable enclaves of ethnic isolation. We just don't deal with people who are different from us. Segregation is no longer the law, but too often separation is still the rule.</p>
        <p>And we cannot forget one stubborn fact that has not yet been said as clearly as it should.</p>
        <p>There are still people who can't get over it, who can't let it go, who can't go through the day unless they have somebody else to look down on. And it manifests itself in our streets and in our neighborhoods, and in the workplace, and in the schools. And it is wrong. And we have to keep working on it, not just with our voices, but with our laws.  And we have to engage each other in it.</p>
        <p>Of course we should celebrate our diversity, the marvelous blends of cultures and beliefs and races has always enriched America, and it is our meal ticket to the 21st century. But we also have to remember with the painful lessons of the civil wars and the ethnic cleansing around the world, that any nation that indulges itself in destructive separatism will not be able to meet and master the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
        <p>We have to decide, all you young people have to decide, will we stand as a shining example or a stunning rebuke to the world of tomorrow? For the alternative to integration is not isolation or a new separate but equal, it is disintegration.</p>
        <p>Only the American idea is strong enough to hold us together. We believe -- whether our ancestors came here in slave ships or on the Mayflower, whether they came through the portals of Ellis Island or on a plane to San Francisco, whether they have been here for thousands of years, we believe that every individual possesses a spark of possibility. . . .</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, we must be concerned, not so much with the sins of our parents as with the success of our children -- how they will live and live together in years to come.</p>
        <p>If those nine children could walk up those steps 40 years ago, all alone, if their parents could send them into the storm armed only with school books and the righteousness of their cause, then surely, together we can build one America.</p>
        <p>An America that makes sure no future generation of our children will have to pay for our mistakes with the loss of their innocence.</p>
