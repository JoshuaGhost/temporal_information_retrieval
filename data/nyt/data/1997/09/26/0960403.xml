        <p>A Victorian 'Peter and Wolf'</p>
        <p>Pity the poor wolf. Ever since ''Little Red Riding Hood'' and ''The Three Little Pigs,'' the wolf has needed an anti-defamation league. Of course, that hasn't stopped humans from casting it as a villain or, at least in this production, as a buffoon.</p>
        <p>''This wolf has never scared anybody yet,'' said Lois Bohovesky, the founding artistic director of the Hudson Vagabond Puppets, which will present Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf'' tomorrow at Arts Connection. As for the wolf's devouring of a duck, ''the comedy is so broad that no one is ever distressed by it,'' she said, ''except, perhaps, a few adults.''</p>

        <p>A Victorian 'Peter and Wolf'</p>
        <p>Pity the poor wolf. Ever since ''Little Red Riding Hood'' and ''The Three Little Pigs,'' the wolf has needed an anti-defamation league. Of course, that hasn't stopped humans from casting it as a villain or, at least in this production, as a buffoon.</p>
        <p>''This wolf has never scared anybody yet,'' said Lois Bohovesky, the founding artistic director of the Hudson Vagabond Puppets, which will present Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf'' tomorrow at Arts Connection. As for the wolf's devouring of a duck, ''the comedy is so broad that no one is ever distressed by it,'' she said, ''except, perhaps, a few adults.''</p>
        <p>Actually, this performance will offer much to please adults. The Hudson Vagabond Puppets are well known for their adaptation of Bunraku, a Japanese technique in which the performers hold and manipulate huge rod puppets. The cast of dancers will use body puppets, too. Puppets that look like glorified knee socks will be conspicuously absent.</p>
        <p>''We decided we wanted to do something a little different, so we set the piece in the Victorian era,'' Ms. Bohovesky said. ''Grandpa enters on a high-wheeler -- an old-fashioned bicycle -- and there are all sorts of Victorian toys in it.''</p>
        <p>Choreographed by Ron Hoffman, a former Ringling Brothers clown, the production is to be part of a sixth- birthday party for Saturdays Alive, Arts Connection's weekend workshop and performance program. Surprises for the guests are promised.</p>
        <p>''Peter and the Wolf'' will be performed tomorrow at 1 and 3 P.M. at Arts Connection, 120 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 302-7433, extension 1440. Tickets: $6. Reservations are advised.</p>
        <p>Waterfront Day</p>
        <p>The vehicles that keep New York  City's streets safe and clean are a visible (and often all too audible) presence. But whoever sees or hears the crews that insure smooth sailing on the waterways? Families will be able to tomorrow, when the Hudson River Park Conservancy presents Working Waterfront Day. This will be an opportunity to tour boats, learn knot-tying, see a waterworks display (it rivals fireworks) and watch actors who are at sea, but not because they don't know their lines.</p>
        <p>Granted, the harbor is a lot safer than it was in the days when sharks swam up the Hudson to feast on the garbage that New Yorkers tossed in (another good reason not to pollute the water). Still, someone has to put out shipboard fires and inspect the waterfront. Such duties fall to fireboats and police boats; one of each will be on view.</p>
        <p>''The Coast Guard will have their tugboat, which is very powerful,'' said Arne Abramowitz, vice president for public affairs at the conservancy. ''Between a fireboat and a tugboat, this is like heaven for kids.''</p>
        <p>At 4:30 P.M., seafaring firefighters  will ''have their hoses trained for a big plumage of water, about 80 or 90 feet high,'' Mr. Abramowitz said. Visitors will also receive poles and bait for catch-and-release fishing.</p>
        <p>Another highlight will be the Caravan Stage Company, whose members live and perform aboard the Amara Zee. They will offer ''The River Show,'' a one-hour comic operetta about the history of the St. Lawrence River, tomorrow and Sunday at 3 P.M. Through Sunday, they will also present ''Trapped: A Whale of a Tale'' at 7:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Working Waterfront Day runs from noon to 5 P.M. tomorrow at Hudson River Park Pier 62, West 23d Street, Chelsea. (Rain date, Sunday.) Free. Information: (212) 533-7275.</p>
        <p>Apple Harvest</p>
        <p>Apples were a primordial fruit not only for Adam and Eve, but also for this country's forefathers. ''One of the first things early Dutch and English settlers did was plant an apple orchard,'' said Jennifer Anderson-Lawrence, site director of Philipsburg Manor, a restored early 18th-century estate in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Those Colonial-era trees are long gone, but their fruits are still cultivated in places like Philipsburg, which is about to hold its annual Apple Harvest Weekend. The apples, with names like Newtown Pippins and Golden Russets, are destined for cider-press and open-hearth-cooking demonstrations.</p>
        <p>Since pasteurization was nonexistent 300 years ago, the results from the demonstrations will not be served, but visitors will be able to buy foods made the modern way from 18th-century recipes.</p>
        <p>''There will also be activities from the days when toys didn't come from Toys 'R' Us,'' Ms. Anderson-Lawrence said. Children will make Indian cornhusk dolls as well as shell corn and take it to the Philipsburg miller for grinding. For those who insist on contemporary amusements, an animated film of ''Rip Van Winkle'' is to be shown each day at 2.</p>
        <p>Bright and Broad, a pair of young oxen, will join Nip and Tuck, the manor's 8-year-old team, to demonstrate why they were so good as Colonial-era tractors. Sheep and chicken, all 18th-century breeds, will complete the historical tableau.</p>
        <p>Apple Harvest Weekend runs from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. tomorrow and Sunday, rain or shine, at Philipsburg Manor, Route 9, Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., (914) 631-3992. Admission: $8; the elderly, $7; ages 6 to 17, $4; 5 and under, free.</p>
        <p>ALSO RECOMMENDED</p>
        <p>''Atlantic Antic'' on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn on Sunday (Street Fairs, page 43); the ''Central Park at Autumn'' tour tomorrow and Sunday (Walking Tours, page 43).</p>
