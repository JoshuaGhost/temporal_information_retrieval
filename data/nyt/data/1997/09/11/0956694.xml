        <p>Like many Secretaries of State before her, Madeleine K. Albright paid a solemn and pensive visit today to Yad Vashem, the Israeli memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, on her first official visit to the Jewish state.</p>
        <p>As a choir and a cantor sang, she laid a wreath to the dead and rekindled the eternal flame in the memorial's stark Hall of Remembrance. She stood with bowed head as the gray smoke from that flame curled and wavered up through a hole in the roof, reminding all who watched, as it was meant to, of the smoke from the Nazi ovens.</p>

        <p>Like many Secretaries of State before her, Madeleine K. Albright paid a solemn and pensive visit today to Yad Vashem, the Israeli memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, on her first official visit to the Jewish state.</p>
        <p>As a choir and a cantor sang, she laid a wreath to the dead and rekindled the eternal flame in the memorial's stark Hall of Remembrance. She stood with bowed head as the gray smoke from that flame curled and wavered up through a hole in the roof, reminding all who watched, as it was meant to, of the smoke from the Nazi ovens.</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright's visit was one that evoked a personal connection to the Holocaust. Less than a year ago, she first began to believe the increasing evidence that her parents were not originally Roman Catholic, as they had told her, but were Jews who had chosen to convert to Christianity to escape.</p>
        <p>It was only nine months ago that she was informed, by The Washington Post, that at least three of her grandparents had died in the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>And it was only last Sunday, on a private pilgrimage with two of her daughters, their husbands, and her sister, that Ms. Albright went to the former Nazi concentration camp, Theresienstadt, north of Prague, where all three of her grandparents were interned and one died. Another died at a Polish camp called Trawniky; the third at Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>''I am filled with emotion,'' Ms. Albright said in a brief statement after her tour of Yad Vashem. ''The history remembered here is at odds with all we would like to believe about ourselves, and about our world,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''It is a history of unbearable sadness, unrelieved suffering and unbelievable cruelty. That is why this memorial and this museum are so troubling, and why it matters so much that they continue to trouble us.''</p>
        <p>While her newly discovered Jewish roots have caused quiet speculation in the Middle East about her diplomatic positions concerning Israel, she has regularly insisted that her views on the region were set long ago, that she has always been a strong friend to Israel and that she has always tried to keep personal emotions from affecting policy decisions.</p>
        <p>She took her tour of Yad Vashem with the memorial's director, Avner Shalev, and with the Israeli Ambassador to the United States, Eliahu Ben Elissar, who escaped as a child from Poland and made his way to Palestine. The Yad Vashem staff gave her a list of some 60 pages of people deported from the former Czechoslovakia, and another list of family members or possible family members who also died during the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>More than a dozen of her relatives may have perished in the Holocaust, and Ms. Albright is continuing her private effort to find out as much as she can about her relatives, some of them obscure to her, and their fate, said her spokesman, James P. Rubin.</p>
        <p>The search was also aided by documents she received from the curators at Theresienstadt.</p>
