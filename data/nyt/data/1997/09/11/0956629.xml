        <p>CARNIVALS spring out of trailers, so why not schools? In New York City, where school buildings are always in need of repair, finding temporary classrooms is a constant problem. The answer may be inflatable classrooms that can be delivered by truck. In January, Martin Raab, president of the New York City School Construction Authority, asked FTL/Happold, an architectural and engineering firm in Manhattan, to design a prototype of a mobile classroom that would be more efficient and less expensive than the trailers the Board of Education is now using. With the push of a button -- on the drawing board, at least -- walls are extended hydraulically, while the floor unfolds and the roof expands, forming two classrooms for 35 students each (above and right). The prototype, which is expected next summer, will compress 1,500 square feet into 336 square feet inside a container 42 feet long, 8 feet wide and 8 feet high.</p>
        <p>Todd Dalland, a partner at FTL/Happold, said, ''When it's fully opened, a service pod, a small trailer, pulls up next to the deployed classrooms and plugs onto it, providing toilets and a diesel fuel generator, which powers the heating.''</p>
