        <p>Editorial says Rev Al Sharpton's success in forcing Manhattan Borough Pres Ruth Messinger into mayoral primary runoff should be blamed on Messinger campaign, which failed to give people positive reason to show up to vote; says Messinger must tailor message to vast majority of New Yorkers who remain unconvinced she would be better mayor than Rudolph Giuliani, and must show that her management of primary campaign was not indicator of her executive ability (M)</p>

        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton's success in forcing Ruth Messinger into a runoff for the Democratic mayoral nomination has shocked many New York City Democrats -- none more than Ms. Messinger. But the message that was delivered Tuesday could not have been clearer. People need a positive reason to show up to vote in a primary election, and Ms. Messinger did not give them one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton proved in the 1992 Senate primary that he can be an engaging campaigner, particularly when he is positioned in a series of debates against several grim-looking opponents. But his surprise showing then, and his surprise showing Tuesday, were based on a virtually identical number of votes, down to the borough breakdown. Mr. Sharpton's appeal does not seem to have grown. But in an extraordinarily small turnout -- the lowest for a Democratic primary since World War II -- that core of support loomed very large.</p>

        <p>The Rev. Al Sharpton's success in forcing Ruth Messinger into a runoff for the Democratic mayoral nomination has shocked many New York City Democrats -- none more than Ms. Messinger. But the message that was delivered Tuesday could not have been clearer. People need a positive reason to show up to vote in a primary election, and Ms. Messinger did not give them one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton proved in the 1992 Senate primary that he can be an engaging campaigner, particularly when he is positioned in a series of debates against several grim-looking opponents. But his surprise showing then, and his surprise showing Tuesday, were based on a virtually identical number of votes, down to the borough breakdown. Mr. Sharpton's appeal does not seem to have grown. But in an extraordinarily small turnout -- the lowest for a Democratic primary since World War II -- that core of support loomed very large.</p>
        <p>A look at the voting results shows another secret to Mr. Sharpton's strong showing that is good news for the city's political future. Almost all the hard-fought races for Borough President and City Council involved minority candidates, and they stimulated a healthy amount of voter interest. While some Council races in white middle-class districts drew less than 8,000 votes, a City Council primary in the low-income East New York area of Brooklyn  drew nearly 10,000 Democrats, and one in the Bronx district that centers on Co-op City drew nearly 12,000.</p>
        <p>More than 16,000 people turned out in the Harlem district being vacated by Virginia Fields. Many of them were undoubtedly supporting Ms. Fields's campaign for Borough President. But they were also drawn out by the organizations marshaled by the Council candidates themselves, each of whom had a record of active involvement in his or her community.</p>
        <p>In the mayoral primary, the presence of City Council member Sal Albanese was obviously the most important factor in depriving Ms. Messinger of the 40 percent vote she needed to avoid a runoff. Ms. Messinger was only a few thousand votes short of that total. Her supporters quickly pointed out that the primary fell right after back-to-school week, amid the distractions of the deaths of Princess Diana and Mother Teresa. Ms. Messinger credited anger over the police brutality scandal involving Abner Louima for mobilizing Mr. Sharpton's support.</p>
        <p>None of that, however, should obscure the bigger picture. Democrats who liked Mr. Sharpton went to the polls and voted for him while the people who should have been Ms. Messinger's backers stayed home. Perhaps this was because of her poor or nonexistent get-out-the-vote effort, her overreliance on out-of-town consultants or her much-criticized decision to ignore her primary opponents and direct her fire only at Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is running for re-election. Perhaps her supporters were overconfident. Still, voters who believe they are supporting a winner generally show up.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Sharpton, his energy has always been one of the keys to his success. His opposition usually underestimates him, and his supporters, with a hunch that he will confound the establishment, happily go to the polls to be part of the upset.</p>
        <p>The Democrats will now move on to the runoff, each with distinct tasks. Mr. Sharpton has never actually had to defend his own record rather than simply criticize his opponents. His job now is to explain how he could appeal to the broad coalition of ethnic groups needed for a credible mayoral campaign, given his destructive and divisive history in the Tawana Brawley case. He will also have to explain why a person with no history of holding elective office or administrative jobs is qualified to run the city.</p>
        <p>Ms. Messinger's campaign has veered from muted responses to dry but worthy position papers to broad-banded denunciation of the incumbent. She has struggled constantly for the proper tone. Now  she must tailor her message to the vast majority of New Yorkers who have obviously not yet been convinced that she would make a better mayor than Mr. Giuliani. Her latest focus on schools is far too concentrated on attacking the Mayor instead of persuading voters she could do better. Ms. Messinger also must show that her management of the primary campaign was not an indicator of her executive ability.</p>
