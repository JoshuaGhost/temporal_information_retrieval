        <p>LESS than a year after my wife and I moved into an 1880's brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn, we had to get new windows. About halfway through the installation, our catch phrase became, ''If only we had known.''</p>
        <p>We did not ask the right questions, we did not understand what the new windows would do to the look of our house, and the window company we settled on did not anticipate our concerns. We even discovered that the words ''new windows'' have different meanings to different suppliers. People who quoted us low prices, some of them averaging less than $1,000 a window, did not mean what we meant: the whole thing, with glass, frame and trim.</p>

        <p>LESS than a year after my wife and I moved into an 1880's brownstone in Park Slope, Brooklyn, we had to get new windows. About halfway through the installation, our catch phrase became, ''If only we had known.''</p>
        <p>We did not ask the right questions, we did not understand what the new windows would do to the look of our house, and the window company we settled on did not anticipate our concerns. We even discovered that the words ''new windows'' have different meanings to different suppliers. People who quoted us low prices, some of them averaging less than $1,000 a window, did not mean what we meant: the whole thing, with glass, frame and trim.</p>
        <p>Simply put, like anyone replacing windows, we had to educate ourselves. Here are issues that arose.</p>
        <p>WOOD OR NOT WOOD -- Exterior wood frames, sashes and even mullions might be required if you live in a landmark district or have neighborhood design covenants. If you live in a landmark area, contact the local landmarks commission before signing a contract for windows or any work visible from the outside.</p>
        <p>Aluminum-clad and vinyl-covered windows will never need painting on the outside. Hurd, Pella, Marvin, Pozzi (makers of aluminum-clad windows) and Andersen (vinyl-covered) offer wood on the inside so you can paint or stain it to match your interior. Lower in the market, some manufacturers offer windows that are metal inside and out, with no wood at all, at half the price of the aluminum-clad wooden windows.</p>
        <p>We wanted aluminum on the outside, and wood on the inside. We specified that we wanted aluminum framing on the outside, as well, not just aluminum sheeting that would cap the existing wooden frame.</p>
        <p>HOW MUCH TO REPLACE -- Some replacement windows virtually snap into old frames, leaving sills and exterior trim intact. For an added cost, you can replace everything down to the jambs, getting all-new exterior trim, too. Since some of our sills and sashes were rotted, we decided to replace all our double-hung windows -- 13 in all, including five 92-inch-tall parlor windows.</p>
        <p>ENERGY EFFICIENCY -- Having paid one winter's heating bills, we wanted insulated (double paned) glass. These can come coated to keep out the sun's heat and filled with gases like argon to reduce heat transfer between the two panes of glass. If  sun and extreme temperatures are concerns, you should consider these extra-cost options.</p>
        <p>MULLIONS -- Whether to have simple windows with one large light per sash or true divided lights (or snap-in grilles) depends on the style of your house and on how much you want to spend. Simpler is less expensive, sometime much less, and windows with one light per sash are  easier to paint and clean. Remember that snap-in grilles can also be snapped out and broken, especially by children. We chose to go with what our house had when we bought it, one light per sash.</p>
        <p>COLOR -- If you choose vinyl or aluminum, you want a color you can live with forever. People in wooden houses, or houses of painted brick, have more choices. If the house is unpainted brick or stone it is important to find a complementary color, one that doesn't offer so strong a contrast that it would put off future buyers. Fortunately or unfortunately, vinyl and aluminum windows come in relatively few colors. On the front of our house, the trim had been painted black; the back had gray windows and trim. We wanted the same colors but settled for bronze for the front, gray for the back; aluminum does not come in black.</p>
        <p>CHOOSING A MANUFACTURER -- It could be that only one manufacturer makes the type of window needed for the type of screen -- half or full -- wanted. Dealers should be able to send customers in the right direction. Try to find people who have installed the brands you are interested in.</p>
        <p>One installer we contacted came, measured our windows and quoted us a suspiciously low price for Pella windows. I called Pella to make sure that they made aluminum-clad windows with wooden interiors as tall as we needed. They didn't. The installer assured me that the windows would be either custom Pella or ''something just as good.'' In window talk, ''custom'' means within certain minimum and maximum widths and heights, but our height exceeded Pella's maximum for double-hung windows. (Only Marvin, which makes each window to order, could give us the height we needed.)</p>
        <p>REFERENCES -- Ask the installer where he has done a similar installation. If you have a brick house and want aluminum-clad windows, then look at a brick house with aluminum-clad windows. If he can't come up with addresses, he may not have the level of experience you want. Two people in our neighborhood had received the type of windows we needed from the same installer.</p>
        <p>ALL AT ONCE? -- Some homeowners replace windows one room at a time, as they can afford it. If you do this, stay with the same manufacturer and color, at least on each side of the house. Even doing this, there is a chance colors won't match from one batch of windows to another.</p>
        <p>GLASS AREA -- Replacement windows generally will not have as much glass area as original windows. The originals may have had weights buried in the wall. New windows will probably have the lifting mechanism in the window frame. When our windows were installed, we were disappointed to find that we had lost two or three inches of daylight from the width of each window.</p>
        <p>MOLDINGS -- Ask your installer how he plans to trim out the new windows. If he says it will look like your original trim, ask whether the new windows will fit into the wall opening like the originals. Odds are that they won't, and the original trim might look skimpy against the bulkier windows. Watch out for rounded or bull-nosed pieces that might be placed against your window frame, creating a crevice that will be difficult to paint or stain.</p>
        <p>Try to get your installer to show you trim samples. If you plan to stain the windows and trim, ask him to hide as many nail holes as possible and to fill gaps with wood, not caulking or plastic wood, which can look awful if the surrounding wood is stained dark. Try to be there when the trim is going in. Our windows didn't fit as snugly into the wall openings as we had hoped. The installer explained that the house had settled, leaving some windows out of square. He tried to make the  windows as tall and as wide as he could and still fit their square corners into our trapezoidal openings.</p>
        <p>Inside, he had to taper some pieces of trim to join the window with the original (sloping) woodwork. At our request he added trim that masked some of the bulk of the new windows. And for four windows, we had him switch to a straight trim that fits flush against the frames, which was simpler to stain.</p>
        <p>INTERIOR FINISH -- Once the windows are installed, they have to be painted or stained. Most manufacturers leave the interior wood unfinished; exterior wood might come with a primer coat. Your installer might be willing to finish sashes and trim; those we spoke with would not. Painters are likely to consider the trim around windows too small a job, so you might want to combine installation with a larger painting job. After paying for the windows, your budget might force you to do the job. My wife, Jane, used an artist's brush to get stain into some crevices around our bull-nose trim.</p>
        <p>COMPLAINTS -- If you have a problem that the installer cannot or will not fix, contact the manufacturer. Windows come with warranties and the companies will try to resolve problems. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs says new-window complaints peaked in the late 1980's, when a lot of apartment buildings were putting in insulated windows and there were problems like condensation. These days, Consumer Affairs gets few complaints; most involve billing. In our case, the replacement windows cost about as much as a new car, and will last, we figure, 50 years. After that, we won't care anymore.</p>
