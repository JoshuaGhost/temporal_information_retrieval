        <p>The silver BMW that Nelson G. Gross, the former New Jersey Republican chairman, was seen driving when he disappeared on Wednesday was found yesterday in New York City, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.</p>
        <p>The spokeswoman, Ann Todd, would not give any further details on the investigation. But she said the agency was treating the disappearance of Mr. Gross, who family members say drove off with two unidentified men after withdrawing $20,000 from a bank in Edgewater, N.J., as a possible kidnapping. A newscast on  Channel 11 reported that the car was found at 160th Street and Riverside Drive in Manhattan, about 15 blocks south of the George Washington Bridge.</p>

        <p>The silver BMW that Nelson G. Gross, the former New Jersey Republican chairman, was seen driving when he disappeared on Wednesday was found yesterday in New York City, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said.</p>
        <p>The spokeswoman, Ann Todd, would not give any further details on the investigation. But she said the agency was treating the disappearance of Mr. Gross, who family members say drove off with two unidentified men after withdrawing $20,000 from a bank in Edgewater, N.J., as a possible kidnapping. A newscast on  Channel 11 reported that the car was found at 160th Street and Riverside Drive in Manhattan, about 15 blocks south of the George Washington Bridge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gross, 65, was last seen on Wednesday morning in Edgewater, law enforcement officials said. His brother, Michael, said Mr. Gross had just withdrawn the $20,000 from the bank next door to a floating restaurant he owns. The Gross family has offered a $100,000 reward for information on his whereabouts.</p>
        <p>Michael Gross said yesterday in an interview that he had heard that ''the entire Newark office of the F.B.I. has been called out.''</p>
        <p>''I'm very, very happy with at least the level of investigation,'' he said. ''There's something wrong here that's very bad. I would say there is something foul. But this is going to be solved; I'm confident of that.''</p>
        <p>Michael Gross was quoted yesterday in The Record of Hackensack as saying that his brother, a prominent developer, had also withdrawn $75,000 last week from the same bank, a branch of the Bank of New York. Michael Gross added, however, that he did not believe his brother  had been coerced into making the withdrawals. He told The Record that photographs taken by the bank's security cameras show that Mr. Gross did not appear threatened.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Michael Gross would not confirm the published accounts of his comments. Another newspaper, The Star-Ledger of Newark, reported yesterday that Nelson Gross's wife, Noel, said their son, Neil, saw Mr. Gross getting into his 1990 BMW sedan outside the bank with the two men on Wednesday and called his father on a cellular phone to make sure he was all right. Noel Gross said her husband replied, ''It's business. It's just business,'' and hung up.</p>
        <p>Nelson Gross, a lawyer who lives in Saddle River, was the head of the Republican State Committee in the 1960's and ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1970. He was a powerful Republican fund-raiser until he was convicted in 1974 of tax fraud for advising a client to write off a $5,000 political contribution as a tax-deductible business expense.</p>
        <p>After serving six months in prison, Mr. Gross became active in real estate. He owns a floating restaurant complex that includes the Binghamton Ferryboat and another boat, the Sidewheeler. His wife is the head of the New Jersey Racing Commission.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. has asked anyone with information about Mr. Gross to call its reward line at (888) 410-0555.</p>
