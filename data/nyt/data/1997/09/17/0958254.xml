        <p>It has taken a couple of years for Tom Gullikson, captain of the United States Davis Cup squad, to perfect his recruiting technique. He gets down on one knee and begs a fluctuating crop of recalcitrant stars to honor their country and observe tennis tradition by taking part in a century-old international competition that seems to be flourishing in every nation but the one that created it.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry to say that it probably is way less relevant to our players now than it was in the older days when Davis Cup was bigger almost than the Slams,'' Gullikson said. ''When they write the history books, it's the Grand Slam titles and Davis Cup championships you've won that define your career, but I don't think players of today see it as a priority anymore. At least, I know some of ours don't.''</p>

        <p>It has taken a couple of years for Tom Gullikson, captain of the United States Davis Cup squad, to perfect his recruiting technique. He gets down on one knee and begs a fluctuating crop of recalcitrant stars to honor their country and observe tennis tradition by taking part in a century-old international competition that seems to be flourishing in every nation but the one that created it.</p>
        <p>''I'm sorry to say that it probably is way less relevant to our players now than it was in the older days when Davis Cup was bigger almost than the Slams,'' Gullikson said. ''When they write the history books, it's the Grand Slam titles and Davis Cup championships you've won that define your career, but I don't think players of today see it as a priority anymore. At least, I know some of ours don't.''</p>
        <p>Gullikson did bring together a squad that won the 1995 cup, but hampered by a combination of player apathy and player inconsistency, he has gone back to the drawing board for the past two seasons.</p>
        <p>Tony Roche and John Newcombe, the coach and captain of an imposing team from Australia that takes on the United States this weekend in a semifinal between the two most successful nations in Davis Cup history, do not share Gullikson's problem. Neither do captains of Italy and Sweden, who oppose each other in the other semifinal in Sweden this weekend.</p>
        <p>The Australians, now headlined by the new United States Open champion, Patrick Rafter, are genuine volunteers who line up with alacrity for the opportunity to play Davis Cup the way Rod Laver and Roy Emerson and Newcombe used to.</p>
        <p>''I think it's sad if a player can't commit himself to playing for his country,'' Roche said. ''I'm completely convinced that a player who's committed to Davis Cup, and to his team, can lift himself into accomplishing what had been impossible before.''</p>
        <p>Roche cites Rafter as a recent example. Even before he won his first Grand Slam title 10 days ago, the resurgent Rafter had said he owed everything positive that has happened this year -- the best of his career -- to Roche and Newcombe for allowing him to play Davis Cup.</p>
        <p>Nobody has thanked Gullikson. Top-ranked Pete Sampras and No. 2 Michael Chang were too busy to play the first two rounds of Davis Cup. Jim Courier, who will either ride the bench or play doubles, signed on for the full year and is annoyed that he was displaced for the singles semifinals. There is no United States doubles team to speak of.</p>
        <p>Gullikson is only half joking when he says that if it gets to the point that he has to get down on both knees to persuade players such as Sampras and Chang, perhaps it is time to make the United States team obsolete and let the rest of the world carry the Davis Cup banner.</p>
        <p>Gullikson also figures prominently in a proposal -- mostly generated within the United States and not supported by other Davis Cup nations -- that demands drastic changes to the cup format in exchange for the continued presence of top stars such as Sampras.</p>
        <p>''Davis Cup could be one of the best ways of promoting our sport,'' Gullikson said.</p>
        <p>He counts Davis Cup matches in countries such as Sweden, Brazil, Russia and France as some of tennis's most electrifying moments. ''Davis Cup certainly is not dead in those countries,'' he said. ''They love to beat up on the big, bad U.S.A. But then we come home, and it's quiet.</p>
        <p>''You know, you don't need to be a sophisticated tennis fan to appreciate the drama of Davis Cup: all you have to know is what country you're from. But mention Davis Cup in the United States, and most people haven't got a clue. They think you're talking about something named after Al Davis, or Davis Love 3d.''</p>
        <p>Harry Marmion, the president of the United States Tennis Association, does not deny that Davis Cup has a popularity problem in this country: ''When France wins the Davis Cup, they have a parade down the Champs-Elysees, and when we win, we get a walk in the park.''</p>
        <p>But Marmion does not favor changing a format that works in more than a hundred other nations just to make Davis Cup more convenient for American players and more attractive to the American public. ''We have to be mindful that many of these federations in smaller countries derive their entire budget from Davis Cup revenues, he said. ''On this issue, I think we have to abide by what the majority rules.''</p>
        <p>Davis Cup is contested by 131 national teams, 16 of them in the elite world group that has qualified to compete for the cup, the rest trying to work their way up to that status. Davis Cup, which is run by the International Tennis Federation, offers $10 million in total prize money, generates $20 million from international television and sponsorship deals, and is responsible for subsidizing federations in the less-established tennis nations, many too small to support any tournaments except Davis Cup.</p>
        <p>The competition is staged throughout the year, and the Davis Cup champion wins four rounds at four different sites. Between travel, practice and competition time, a player who commits to four cup rounds can conceivably lose eight weeks of his yearly schedule.</p>
        <p>Historically, there had not been a problem in attracting American players to Davis Cup. ''Back when I started playing just after World War II, in 1946, it was the thing to do,'' said 79-year-old William Talbert. ''If you'd made the Davis Cup team, you'd made the big time. But now the players don't seem to care.''</p>
        <p>Like Talbert, Stan Smith grew up equating Davis Cups with Grand Slam trophies. And like Talbert, Smith advocates changing the format if that is what it takes to make Davis Cup matter again.</p>
        <p>''It's antiquated, and it needs to be changed if they want to make it special again, and I say this with some sadness because of the significance of what Davis Cup has been,'' Smith said. ''I've always been an advocate of playing the world group every two years, but unfortunately,  the International Tennis Federation seems more interested in trying to fill their pockets than getting the best players to compete.''</p>
        <p>Many American players -- notably Sampras -- have lobbied for a Davis Cup schedule that imitates golf's Ryder Cup between the United States and Europe: hold the competition once every two years, preferably for one week in one place. In essence, the players want it shrunk.</p>
        <p>''It does mean something to me, but I'm not going to lie and say the Slams don't mean more,'' said Sampras, who played singles and doubles when the United States won the 1995 cup in Moscow and could be asked to take on the same heavy role against Australia. ''It's unique; it's rare to be on a team. But in the U.S., it has definitely lost its popularity, and I think if we had it less often, it would get more attention.''</p>
        <p>And attract more top-ranked performers like himself. ''I really believe that in the end, the top players have to play, and if they don't, then Davis Cup isn't going to succeed,'' Sampras said.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the I.T.F. is not having any of this American insurrection and the suggestion of an alternate-year format. It's the U.S. against the rest of the world. ''It's not a possibility,'' said Brian Tobin, the I.T.F.'s president, citing financial and sponsorship constraints and an unwillingness to tamper with the event's continuity.</p>
        <p>''Of course nothing lasts forever, and I'm in favor of moving with the times, '' he said, ''but if there is an identity problem with Davis Cup, it's only in the United States, and I think that should be a little disappointing for the country that started Davis Cup.''</p>
        <p>The I.T.F. has offered to explore a suggestion that would give the two cup finalists a first-round bye the following year. ''We're looking at cutting the world group to 14, giving the finalists a bye, and there are some pluses in that,'' Tobin said. ''But you can't tell these countries that Davis Cup won't be played every year just because there's two or three American players who don't want to commit. In the rest of the world, Davis Cup is a big deal.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, even John McEnroe, who once brought a passion to Davis Cup and said he would have gladly played doubles this weekend if Gullikson had asked him to, says change is needed.</p>
        <p>''It's time to find a formula that makes Davis Cup acceptable to the players and their schedules,'' he said. ''I would lock them all in a room with their agents, the I.T.F., the A.T.P., and not let them come out until they've reached an agreement that makes it so that every top player wants to commit. Everybody forgets that Ryder Cup used to be the U.S. against England; well, they changed that, and it didn't ruin it. I think it's time to sit down and make Davis Cup work for everybody.''</p>
