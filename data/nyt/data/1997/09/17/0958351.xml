        <p>Can ''The Hollywood Squares'' help CBS stations put some of their rival stations in ratings jeopardy?</p>
        <p>The company must believe so, because yesterday its CBS stations' group announced a major deal to bring a new version of the syndicated game show to most CBS-owned stations next fall -- a deal that industry sources said would cost the stations in excess of $50 million.</p>
        <p>Game shows, in particular ''Jeopardy'' and ''Wheel of Fortune,'' have become important for local television stations in building an audience during the period known as prime-time access, the hour from 7 to 8 P.M., when viewers are beginning to settle in for the evening.</p>
        <p>''We believe this property, like those that have come from King World in the past, will be a powerhouse,'' said Mel Karmazin, chairman and chief executive officer of the CBS Station Group.</p>
        <p>The new show will be a co-production of King World (which also distributes ''Wheel of Fortune,'' ''Jeopardy'' and ''Oprah'') and Sony Pictures Entertainment. The show will be seen on 11 of CBS's 14 stations, including New York's WCBS; the three not receiving it (Green Bay, Baltimore and Minneapolis) have prior programming commitments.</p>
