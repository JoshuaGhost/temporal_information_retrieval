        <p>Comment on Jeff Barnes, 27-year-old Seattle bartender who appears in Miller Lite ads as supposed creator of ad campaign (Sunday column) (S)</p>

        <p>You've probably seen the Miller Lite ads that feature a photo of a red-haired goof named Dick, supposedly the creative genius behind the campaign. It turns out that Dick is Jeff Barnes, 27, a Seattle bartender who was chosen after a nationwide ''talent'' search. Latest: Barnes is stepping out qua himself. He plays in a rock band, and grants interviews only after getting Miller's approval, all as part of Miller's plan to keep Dick going (as long as the public will have him). Why does this man bewitch us? ''He's an average Joe,'' says a Miller spokeswoman, ''who seems to have something on his mind.''</p>
