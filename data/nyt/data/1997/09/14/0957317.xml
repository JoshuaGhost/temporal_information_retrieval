        <p>LAST week's primary in Westchester showed the power of  party structure, for in most cases officially designated candidates defeated their challengers in intra-party battles.</p>
        <p>Voter turnout was generally light Tuesday -- as is typical in a primary election -- where the Republican, Democratic, Conservative and Independence Parties staged primaries for countywide and local races.</p>
        <p>In a significant race, Kathie E. Davidson, a New Rochelle lawyer, became the Democratic nominee for county clerk and the first black person to run for countywide office other than a judgeship. Ms. Davidson, who was endorsed by the Westchester Democratic Committee, easily defeated Robert A. Morabito, the Rye Town Supervisor, by a vote of 11,276 to 4,250, according to unofficial results from the Board of Elections.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davidson will face Leonard N. Spano, the Republican one-term incumbent, in the general election in November. In what could be a significant development, Mr. Spano may have lost the Conservative Party line to Terrence J. Dwyer of Valhalla, an enrolled Conservative. Unofficial results show that Mr. Dwyer received 935 votes on that line to Mr. Spano's 918. In recent years, the Conservative line has generally been considered crucial to Republicans running in countywide races.</p>
        <p>In the only race affecting candidates for Westchester county executive, Ted Dunn, the Republican candidate, easily defeated Concettta M. Ferrara, the former chairwoman of the Independence Party, for that minor party's nomination. Mr. Dunn, who is also backed by the Conservative Party, will face Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, in the general election.</p>
        <p>In other important races, one incumbent County Legislator, Suzanne R. Swanson of Mount Pleasant, won her Republican primary and another, Robert J. Darcy of New Rochelle, lost his. Both incumbents have been part of a coalition of Republicans, Democrats and a Conservative that has controlled the county's Board of Legislators in the last two years.</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Swanson, an enrolled Conservative, had been endorsed by the Republican Committee for re-election, Mr. Darcy had not. Mrs. Swanson defeated a challenger, John J. McCardle, by drawing about 55 percent of the vote. There is no Democrat running in this race, which is in the Third County Legislative District and includes parts of Greenburgh and Mount Pleasant.</p>
        <p>Jim Maisano of New Rochelle, who claimed he was the ''real Republican,'' defeated Mr. Darcy, garnering  66 percent of the vote to Mr. Darcy's 34 percent, according to unofficial returns. Mr. Maisano also won the backing of the Independence Party over Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy, who has charged that he was being punished by the Republican Party establishment for his independence, remains on the Conservative line. Helped by the Republican Party battling and a likely three-way race is the Democratic candidate, Jack Scarangella of New Rochelle. District 11 includes part of New Rochelle and Pelham.</p>
        <p>In other countywide races, Barbara Zambelli, a Mount Vernon City Court judge, defeated Phillip A. Werbel of New Castle for the Democratic nomination for County Court Judge. She will oppose Mark C. Dillon, who also defeated Mr. Werbel in a Conservative Party primary. For two positions on the Family Court, Bruce E. Tolbert and Linda S. Jamineson won the Conservative Party nominations. Michele Bermel of Chappaqua finished third but remains on the Democratic line.</p>
        <p>One key exception to the general rule that a party's designated candidate usually wins a primary occurred in Yorktown. There, Linda G. Cooper, a one-term incumbent Republican who had been denied her party's nomination, defeated the party's candidate, Gary Ajello, by a vote of 762 to 583, unofficial returns show.</p>
