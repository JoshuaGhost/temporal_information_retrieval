        <p>HAND TO MOUTH  A Chronicle of Early Failure  By Paul Auster  449 pages. Henry Holt &amp; Company. $25.</p>
        <p>''Hand to Mouth,'' Paul Auster's memoir about his early days as a struggling writer, describes a period in his life when he says everything he touched ''turned to failure.'' ''My marriage ended in divorce,'' he writes, ''my work as a writer foundered, and I was overwhelmed by money problems'' -- a ''constant, grinding, almost suffocating lack of money that poisoned my soul and kept me in a state of never-ending panic.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Auster is fairly well known these days (as the author of the critically acclaimed ''New York Trilogy'' and the screenplay for the movie ''Smoke''), he spent much of his 20's and early 30's eking out a meager existence, doing translations and taking odd jobs. He did a stint in the merchant marine on an oil tanker, worked part time for a rare-book dealer and did freelance writing for a movie producer. Desperate for money, he also cranked out a detective novel, tried to sell a card game he'd invented as a boy and even considered responding to a matchbook cover ad that promised, ''Make Money Growing Worms in Your Basement.'' In his free time, he worked on his own poems, plays and novels.</p>
        <p>''I had spent my whole life avoiding the subject of money,'' Mr. Auster writes, ''and now, suddenly, I could think of nothing else. I dreamed of miraculous reversals, lottery millions falling down from the sky, outrageous get-rich-quick schemes.''</p>
        <p>As he recounts in this slim, unsatisfying memoir, Mr. Auster's money problems began as a youthful, high-minded contempt for the bourgeois life of his parents in the New Jersey suburbs. ''I squirmed every time I had to get into the family car -- so bright and new and expensive, so clearly an invitation to the world to admire how well off we were,'' he recalls. ''All my sympathies were for the downtrodden, the dispossessed, the underdogs of the social order, and a car like that filled me with shame -- not just for myself but for living in a world that allowed such things to be in it.'' He would not be a writer who led a double life, masquerading by day as a doctor (like William Carlos Williams) or a banker (like T. S. Eliot), the young Mr. Auster decided. He would instead commit himself fully to being a writer.</p>
        <p>Even given this memoir's limited ambitions -- it is not a full-fledged autobiography but a meditation on the author's early struggles to make a living -- there is something undernourished about it. It's not just the author's flat-footed prose; it's his refusal to give us the sort of color, insight and emotional detail that might transform his narrative into something more than a series of anecdotes strung like pop beads along a theme. Mr. Auster skims over the role his conflicted feelings about his parents' divorce played in shaping his attitude toward money, and he completely ignores the role his destitution played in the breakdown of his marriage.</p>
        <p>The reader gets no real sense of Mr. Auster's relationship with his parents, his ex-wife or his son, no real understanding, for that matter, of his own personality other than that he wanted to be a writer, glamorized the idea of failure and had deeply ambivalent feelings about money. Mr. Auster's reticence on these matters seems motivated less by a conscious desire to withhold secrets than by a writerly obsession with compression and concision. Indeed many fascinating stories in this book are curiously brushed off in asides. Mr. Auster's observation that he once knew 7 of the F.B.I.'s 10 most wanted men -- this was in 1969, when student radicalism was at its height -- is tossed away in a sentence. And his encounters in Mexico with a ''man who threatened to kill me'' and a ''schizophrenic girl who thought I was a Hindu god'' are consigned to a parenthetical mention.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Auster's minimalist impulse -- which has resulted in some elegant, elliptical novels -- proves to be decidedly ill-suited to the autobiographical form. It results here, as it did in an earlier memoir about his father (''The Invention of Solitude,'' 1983), in a spiky, attenuated book that's engaging enough to read but oddly lacking in emotional resonance.</p>
        <p>Curiously enough, this flimsiness seems to have been recognized by Mr. Auster and his editors, who have padded the volume with three long appendices that take up a good two-thirds of the book. Those appendices consist of work done by Mr. Auster during the years described by the memoir. There's the card game about baseball that he tried unsuccessfully to sell; a full-length detective novel about a baseball player who mysteriously dies of poisoning, and three short plays.</p>
        <p>The only reader likely to be interested in these apprentice works is the ardent Paul Auster fan, who will find in them clues to the author's subsequent development. The strongest of the three plays, ''Laurel and Hardy Go to Heaven,'' both reverberates with echoes of Beckett's ''Waiting for Godot'' and anticipates Mr. Auster's 1990 novel, ''The Music of Chance.'' Another play, ''Blackouts,'' with characters named Green, Black and Blue, provides a kind of mise en scene for the 1986 novel ''Ghosts,'' while the detective story,  ''Squeeze Play,'' announces Mr. Auster's interest in the mystery form, which he would develop further in ''The New York Trilogy.''</p>
        <p>The basic themes of Mr. Auster's fiction -- having to do with identity, chance and the elusiveness of truth -- are established in these early works. So, too, are his favorite motifs of waiting, watching and searching. Like the memoir they accompany, however, these early pieces are underdeveloped; they are fledgling works, waiting to be hatched.</p>
