        <p>As the Arab-Israeli peace process continues sliding downhill, American officials say they may soon have to opt for one of two extremes: either ''The Plan'' or ''The Phone Number.'' Either the President lays down, publicly, exactly what steps the U.S. believes Israelis and Palestinians must take to get the process back on track, or he gives them both the White House phone number, 202-456-1414, and tells them to call when they're serious. As one top White House official put it: ''Either we step forward or we step backward, but where we are now is not working.''</p>
        <p>The temptation to walk is great. It would leave Yasir Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu both standing stark naked before their own publics, without any U.S. mediators to hide behind or blame. But such strategic neglect would come at a price the U.S. may not want to pay. Here's why:</p>

        <p>As the Arab-Israeli peace process continues sliding downhill, American officials say they may soon have to opt for one of two extremes: either ''The Plan'' or ''The Phone Number.'' Either the President lays down, publicly, exactly what steps the U.S. believes Israelis and Palestinians must take to get the process back on track, or he gives them both the White House phone number, 202-456-1414, and tells them to call when they're serious. As one top White House official put it: ''Either we step forward or we step backward, but where we are now is not working.''</p>
        <p>The temptation to walk is great. It would leave Yasir Arafat and Benjamin Netanyahu both standing stark naked before their own publics, without any U.S. mediators to hide behind or blame. But such strategic neglect would come at a price the U.S. may not want to pay. Here's why:</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat is not and has never been a democrat. He is at heart a typical Arab autocrat, for whom corruption, censorship and abuse of political opponents come naturally. Yet as a result of the Oslo process, Mr. Arafat has also presided over the creation of a Palestinian parliament, in the freest election ever in the Arab world. Palestinian elites were hopeful that as Mr. Arafat shifted the basis of his authority from leader of an armed struggle to leader of a peace process bringing Palestinians land and prosperity, he would be willing to -- indeed would have to -- tolerate more democracy within Palestinian life. In Jordan, too, King Hussein began fostering a freely elected Parliament and freer press to broaden his legitimacy for making peace with Israel and reforming Jordan's economy.</p>
        <p>With the collapse of the Oslo process these baby steps toward democratization are being quashed, and Mr. Arafat and King Hussein are reverting to form. This is, in part, because both men had made huge bets on Oslo. As it crumbles, they feel increasingly politically exposed. Their critics are now out in full force, declaring, ''I told you this would never work.'' And so their natural inclination is to silence all critics before they become a serious political challenge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat's outrageous arrest of one of the finest Palestinian journalists, Daoud Kuttab, is a good example. Mr. Kuttab's sin was that his infant Palestinian educational television station, a direct outgrowth of the peace process and the only real competitor to Mr. Arafat's official station, was broadcasting debates of the Palestinian legislature, another outgrowth of the peace process. The Palestinian legislators often criticize Mr. Arafat's rule. When things were going well he was ready to ignore much of it, but with his peace strategy in shambles he sees this sort of criticism as a more serious threat, and so he arrests Mr. Kuttab. (He finally released him Tuesday.) In Jordan, King Hussein, also feeling besieged, has been clamping down on the press and tightening rules for who can run for office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Netanyahu loves to lecture the Arab states about how they must become democracies. But he is just trying to score propaganda points. Because Bibi is utterly blind to the relationship between the peace process and the process of internal change in the Arab world. Yitzhak Rabin chose not to build in Jerusalem because King Hussein wrote him and said such a move would badly undercut the King at home. With Bibi, King Hussein comes to Israel, asks him not to build in Jerusalem, and Bibi announces -- at a joint news conference with the King -- that he is going ahead anyway. Hello?</p>
        <p>It would be absurd to suggest that the peace process is a cure-all for Arab politics. Democratization will only come to the Arab world after fundamental changes in Arab political culture. But the peace process helps promote internal changes, opens Arab societies and business to more outside contacts and puts some power in the hands of Arab democrats, like Daoud Kuttab. That is exactly why Syria's Hafez al-Assad fears the peace process. It's also why fledgling Arab democrats in Palestine or Jordan will be much worse off without it.</p>
        <p>Which is also why, as much as I'd love to stick Mr. Arafat and Mr. Netanyahu with the phone number, that would be too easy on them. They might never dial the phone. The U.S. needs to come up with a clear-cut plan that engages every Israeli and Palestinian, presents them with some real choices and, ideally,  enlists their pressure to move forward.</p>
