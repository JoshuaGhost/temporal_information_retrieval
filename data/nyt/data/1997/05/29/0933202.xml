        <p>In his first comment on the Supreme Court's decision to let a sexual harassment lawsuit against him proceed, President Clinton said today that he was concerned about the precedent it set.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he was considering a settlement with the woman who brought the case, Paula Corbin Jones, Mr. Clinton referred questions to his lawyer, Robert S. Bennett.</p>
        <p>''I think I should continue to let him speak for me,'' the President said.</p>
        <p>''As to what might happen to future Presidents, I am concerned about that,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''There may not be anything to be done about that. The Supreme Court made its decision.''</p>
        <p>The Court ruled unanimously on Tuesday that the sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Mr. Clinton by Ms. Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, could go forward while he was in office.</p>
        <p>The decision came as Mr. Clinton was on a three-day tour of Europe that included the signing of an agreement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia and celebrations here to mark the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Plan for the reconstruction of Europe after World War II.</p>
