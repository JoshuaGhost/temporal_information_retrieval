        <p>A Palestinian journalist was being held without charges by the Palestinian police in the West Bank city of Ramallah today, evidently because of Yasir Arafat's irritation with his live television broadcasts of meetings of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</p>
        <p>The journalist, Daoud Kuttab, an American citizen and director of the Modern Media Institute at Al Quds University in Jerusalem, was summoned by a Palestinian police captain to Ramallah Tuesday night, and has been held in the police station in the West Bank city since, Mr. Kuttab's brother and his colleagues said.</p>

        <p>A Palestinian journalist was being held without charges by the Palestinian police in the West Bank city of Ramallah today, evidently because of Yasir Arafat's irritation with his live television broadcasts of meetings of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</p>
        <p>The journalist, Daoud Kuttab, an American citizen and director of the Modern Media Institute at Al Quds University in Jerusalem, was summoned by a Palestinian police captain to Ramallah Tuesday night, and has been held in the police station in the West Bank city since, Mr. Kuttab's brother and his colleagues said.</p>
        <p>American officials said they were told by the Palestinians that Mr. Kuttab was detained on the orders of Mr. Arafat, and was likely to be held at least until Mr. Arafat returned from a trip to Egypt. Mr. Kuttab was reported in good condition.</p>
        <p>Though no reason was given for Mr. Kuttab's detention and no charges were filed, his brother, Jonathan, said he and his institute had several run-ins with officials of the Palestinian Authority over his live broadcasts from sessions of the Palestinian Legislative Council.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday the council, many of whose 88 members are politically independent, fiercely assailed the Palestinian Authority and Mr. Arafat over purported corruption and misuse of official funds. Some council members demanded to see the budget for Mr. Arafat's office and  accused the authority with favoritism in hiring and of subsidizing homes for its ministers.</p>
        <p>''The council's economic committee found that taxpayers' money has been misused,'' declared the report of the council's economic committee, which was read by its chairman, Saad al-Krunz.</p>
        <p>The session was broadcast in several Palestinian cities -- including Ramallah, Bethlehem, Jenin and Nablus -- through the Modern Media Institute.</p>
        <p>The institute, of which Mr. Kuttab is the founder and director, has been broadcasting all council sessions live for about two months with financing from a European grant. In that time, it has had several clashes with the Palestinian Authority, and some of its broadcasts have been cut short by the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, which controls all television stations in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's broadcast was not cut. But after the session ended the head of the Ramallah police, identified only as Captain Fares, summoned Mr. Kuttab to his office. Mr. Kuttab lives in Jerusalem, under Israeli jurisdiction, but went anyway.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Kuttab said: ''I attribute his arrest to some people in the Palestinian Authority, not all, wanting either to stifle the debate or at least not to have the very lively, very democratic debate that goes on in the Legislative Council to be broadcast live to the whole population.'' He added, ''They're trying to limit it, to prevent the publicity as much as they can.''</p>
        <p>Though the 88-member council has won some concessions from Mr. Arafat, it has not directly challenged his leadership.</p>
        <p>The detention of Mr. Kuttab, and the accusations leveled by the Palestinian Legislative Council, added to a growing list of complaints of corruption and human-rights violations by the Palestinian Authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuttab was awarded the International Press Freedom Award last year by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists for his opposition to censorship by both Israeli and Palestinian authorities.</p>
        <p>Several prominent Palestinians have been detained in disputes with the authority, including Bassam Eid, a human-rights monitor in the West Bank, and Eyad Sarraj, a psychiatrist in Gaza who criticized the Authority in an interview.</p>
