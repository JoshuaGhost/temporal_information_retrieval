        <p>Gordon Wies Reed of Greenwich, Conn., who for 22 years was chairman of the Texas Gulf Producing Company, an independent oil and gas concern, died on Saturday after a brief illness, said his son, Thomas, a former Secretary of the Air Force. He was 97.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed was an early supporter of Barry M. Goldwater's 1964 Presidential campaign, starting an independent committee that caused a brief, but sharp, split among Connecticut Republican Party leaders. Mr. Reed was also an early contributor to Ronald W. Reagan's campaign to become governor of California in 1966.</p>

Mr. Reed was also an assistant director of a wartime production board that oversaw aluminum production, and after the war he served on a variety of corporate boards.</p>
        <p>In 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Mr. Reed chairman of a panel that oversaw the transfer of significant military transport duties to commercial airlines.</p>
