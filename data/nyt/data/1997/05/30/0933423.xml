        <p>The Zurich Insurance Group is close to acquiring Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, the money management firm, for an estimated $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the firm's talks with potential buyers.</p>
        <p>With the prospective acquisition, the big Swiss insurance company would be trying to achieve two goals: broaden its asset management expertise -- particularly in developing countries and in the American bond markets where Scudder's strengths lie -- and provide a complement to its Zurich Kemper Investments subsidiary that would help bolster that unit's performance, the people with knowledge of the talks said.</p>

        <p>The Zurich Insurance Group is close to acquiring Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, the money management firm, for an estimated $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the firm's talks with potential buyers.</p>
        <p>With the prospective acquisition, the big Swiss insurance company would be trying to achieve two goals: broaden its asset management expertise -- particularly in developing countries and in the American bond markets where Scudder's strengths lie -- and provide a complement to its Zurich Kemper Investments subsidiary that would help bolster that unit's performance, the people with knowledge of the talks said.</p>
        <p>''There are discussions going on to form a strategic alliance to create a world-class investment organization, which would offer clients Kemper's brokerage capability, Scudder's asset management and Zurich Insurance's global reach,'' said one person familiar with the matter.</p>
        <p>Zurich Insurance completed its acquisition of the Kemper Corporation of Chicago in January 1996 for about $2 billion, but it is still trying to improve the performance of that company. Scudder, which is based in New York, is privately owned by its senior 200 executives. Altogether, it has about 2,500 employees.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Zurich Kemper Investments in Chicago referred questions yesterday about the planned acquisition to Zurich Insurance's head office in Switzerland. That office did not reply to messages left late yesterday. ''As a matter of policy, we don't comment on these matters,'' Eleanor Mascheroni, a spokeswoman for Scudder in New York, said late yesterday.</p>
        <p>Scudder, which has about $115 billion in assets under management, about a month ago retained Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company to help it find ways to enhance the value of its business and also, perhaps, to find a buyer. With many big banks, insurers and brokerage firms scrambling to acquire large money management firms such as Scudder, there has been no shortage of suitors. One reason is that investment management helps assure more stable revenues.</p>
        <p>Several institutions, including the Union Bank of Switzerland, the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the BankAmerica Corporation and the First Union Corporation have all been mentioned in recent weeks as potential acquirers or merger partners with Scudder.</p>
        <p>The prospective sale of Scudder would offer further evidence of the increasing concentration in the asset-management business. A 1995 study of that industry by Goldman, Sachs, which is itself quickly building its own asset-management operation, predicted that there would be only 20 or so companies, each with more than $150 billion of assets, dominating the industry by the end of this century.</p>
        <p>In a parallel trend, the asset-management business has become more capital intensive, and Scudder is apparently eager to find a well-capitalized partner with businesses that complement its own. Zurich Insurance fits that need, the people familiar with the takeover talks said, and also offers the Kemper brokerage network as a further potential distribution route for Scudder's mutual funds. Kemper is also stronger than Scudder in American equity markets, where Scudder is eager to expand its asset-management business.</p>
        <p>On Wall Street, the largest firms, such as Merrill Lynch &amp; Company, the Morgan Stanley Group and Goldman, Sachs, have all been swiftly building asset-management operations. Merrill, for example, acquired Hotchkis &amp; Wiley for about an estimated $200 million last June, to build up its institutional bond management business.</p>
        <p>Morgan Stanley -- which after its merger with Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Company will have $270 billion of assets under management -- acquired Van Kampen/American Capital Inc., which had about $60 billion in assets under management, for more than $1 billion last year. It also bought Miller Anderson &amp; Sherrerd of Philadelphia, which has $33 billion under management, in 1995.</p>
        <p>Goldman acquired CIN Management, British Coal's pension fund manager, last July for an undisclosed sum that many analysts estimated at $65 million to $75 million. That transaction added some $23 billion to its assets under management.</p>
        <p>Some are trying other routes. Citicorp in recent days said it was hiring Peter Carman from Putnam Investments to head its global asset-management business, and would seek to build its fund management internally.</p>
        <p>And mutual fund companies themselves have become more acquisitive as they seek to build greater economies of scale: Franklin Resources Inc., for example, last year bought Heine Securities for an estimated $800 million.</p>
