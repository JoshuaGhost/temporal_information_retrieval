        <p>IT got wild in Miami last night. And suddenly, a series that the Knicks looked like they controlled spun out of control.</p>
        <p>A melee with less than two minutes left in last night's game turned a 96-81 Miami victory into a controversy.</p>
        <p>There will be fines.</p>
        <p>There could be suspensions.</p>
        <p>After the game, one of the referees, Dick Bavetta, said in a statement that all but two Knick reserves left the bench during the melee, making all of those players subject to a possible one-game suspension. Bavetta added that none of the Heat players left the bench.</p>
        <p>''We will review the tape,'' Bavetta said. ''There were two players from New York who did not come off. We're not sure which two, but we will see that from the tape. Also, that tape is sent to the league office, at which point they will decide who didn't come off.''</p>
        <p>Nobody can predict how the Game 5 madness will affect Game 6 tomorrow night, when the Knicks and Heat resume their battle at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>But while the Knicks still lead the four-of-seven-game series, 3-2, it is clear that the Knicks could be severely shorthanded for Game 6.</p>
        <p>This is why it pays to end a series as quickly as possible. Wild things happen in the playoffs. In Game 5, it turned wild. But if the Knicks had won, they could have moved on right away and prepared for the Chicago Bulls. Instead, Miami remains a serious problem. Pat Riley is actually looking forward to making a return trip to Madison Square Garden, boos and all.</p>
        <p>''It's a pressure game for them, they've got to win it,'' Riley said after last night's game. ''We're going up there to win. If we didn't want to continue to play, we could've punched the clock tonight. But our guys wanted to win.''</p>
        <p>But there will be more talk about what happened near the end of the game than about basketball. With 1 minute 53 seconds to play, Charlie Ward and P. J. Brown tangled with each other as Tim Hardaway was taking a free throw, Brown picked up Ward and threw him out of bounds like a rag doll. John Wallace of the Knicks jumped on Brown, and the melee started, with players on both teams piling out of bounds trying to separate each other for nearly a minute.</p>
        <p>Rod Thorn, the National Basketball Association's vice president in charge of handing out discipline, will be watching this tape very closely.</p>
        <p>Asked if he was concerned about the possibility of any his players being suspended, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said: ''Certainly, we will be very concerned. It's not up to my judgment. It's up the N.B.A. office.''</p>
        <p>John Starks was ejected after the melee for making an obscene gesture to the crowd. As security officers led Starks to the locker room, spectators threw debris at him, but fortunately, he continued on his way to the locker room.</p>
        <p>So a series that was already physical took on a truly nasty tone. Even before the final melee, Charles Oakley was ejected with 1:55 left for needlessly shoving Alonzo Mourning. It was one of the few times in the series that the Knicks showed frustration, realizing that the series would not end in Game 5. And the Knicks had no one to blame for that but themselves.</p>
        <p>Miami did not take control of this game until late in the third quarter. Mourning was in foul trouble again, sitting out the final 9:33 of the third quarter after committing his fourth foul. If the Knicks played one of their better games, Miami might have folded. But now the Heat has life.</p>
        <p>After Miami lost Game 4, most observers figured the Heat had a snowball's chance in Miami of winning this series. And the odds are still against the Heat, because the Knicks should be as determined on their home court tomorrow as Miami was on its floor last night.</p>
        <p>However, in the aftermath of the melee and the possible punishments, nobody knew who would not be in uniform for Game 6.</p>
        <p>The Knicks didn't need this. They needed a peaceful victory, time off and a chance to regroup for the Chicago Bulls, the team that the Knicks so badly want to dethrone.</p>
        <p>But last night's events put a whole new light on this series. Miami is still alive, and the Knicks will hold their breath until they hear from Thorn. Before Game 5, New York was in control of this series. But last night, the series took an ugly turn, and a costly turn for the Knicks.</p>
