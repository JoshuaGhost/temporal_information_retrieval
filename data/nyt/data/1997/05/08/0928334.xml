        <p>For the first time, the school board of this predominantly black city will be controlled by black members, five of whom won seats on Tuesday in the election for the nine-member board.</p>
        <p>The black candidates defeated five white candidates who were supported by the Italian Civic Association. For more than 50 years, the association controlled the school board in Mount Vernon, a city where 54 percent of residents and 77 percent of public schoolchildren are black, as are the Mayor and four of five City Council members.</p>
        <p>''This offers us a new possibility to meet the needs of all of this city's children,'' said the Reverend W. Franklyn Richardson, founder of the Coalition for the Empowerment of People of African Ancestry, formed five years ago to oppose the I.C.A.</p>
        <p>The coalition, which fielded the slate of five black candidates, maintained that the I.C.A.'s interest in school politics had everything to do with power and jobs and nothing to do with education. Many school employees are I.C.A. members, including Schools Superintendent William C. Prattella. Coalition officials have long called for the resignation of Mr. Prattella, who, with 25 years on the job, is the longest-serving superintendent in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>Asked about the election results, Mr. Prattella said, ''I would prefer not to comment.''</p>
        <p>The last election, in 1996, resulted in a board of seven whites and two blacks. After that vote, in which four I.C.A. candidates defeated four coalition candidates, the coalition called for a Federal inquiry. Several state  and Federal complaints of racism filed by the coalition are still under investigation.</p>
