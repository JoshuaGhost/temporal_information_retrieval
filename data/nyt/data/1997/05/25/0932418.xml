        <p>The fiscal turnaround came eight months after the arrival of Donald Ray Gardner, a retired Marine Corps major general, as the museum's president and chief executive officer.

        <p>In the fiscal year that ended April 30, the Intrepid, a decommissioned aircraft carrier that opened as a museum in 1982, turned a small profit, $70,000. The year before it lost $1.2 million, another setback in a checkered financial history that includes bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>The fiscal turnaround came eight months after the arrival of Donald Ray Gardner, a retired Marine Corps major general, as the museum's president and chief executive officer. Mr. Gardner cut the staff to 120 from 135, trimmed expenses like phone bills and insurance, and transferred costly-to-maintain ''assets'' -- like the Nantucket, a Coast Guard lightship -- to the H.M.S. Rose Foundation in Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>But with the Intrepid's small measure of financial health has come controversy. Mr. Gardner's predecessor, Lawrence Sowinski, declined to be interviewed, but employees who left in the last year criticized the new president for what they called a failure to stress traditional museum concerns like expanding the collection of exhibits. Mr. Gardner acknowledged internal criticism of his plan to ''thin out'' the Intrepid's collection. ''It is not a view that was shared by everybody who was here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gardner said the Intrepid's board, led by Zachary Fisher, the construction executive who is the museum's main benefactor, had a clear mission: ''to clean up the museum physically and to make a business out of it.''</p>
        <p>One way to do that, he said, is to reduce the number of planes on exhibit -- many of them on loan from the military -- to 10 from 40. ''Ten superbly looking planes, if you can reach that point and I think we can, look better than 40 airplanes that all need restoration,'' he said. So far, Mr. Gardner has found new homes for two Air Force F-84's.</p>
        <p>Last year, museum admissions totaled about $3 million, less than half its $7 million budget. Much of the gap was made up by private donations and renting the carrier out for events like dances and dinners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gardner said he hoped to build an endowment for projects like replacing the carrier's flight deck, at a cost of $9 million. To make the museum more attractive for computer-savvy children, he plans to spend $6 million to $22 million in the next few years on computer displays and interactive kiosks that would, for example, allow youngsters to simulate landing a plane on a carrier deck. ''This is going to be a refurbished, spectacular place to visit,'' he said, ''and every New Yorker is going to want to come here, not once but twice, and bring his kids.''</p>
