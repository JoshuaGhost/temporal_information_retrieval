        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her article about Clifford Odets $(''Championing Odets, Unfashionable as That Is,'' April 27$), Rachel Shteir seems to have me joining Mary McCarthy back in the late 30's in deploring the playwright. Not so.</p>
        <p>The passage she quotes from me (''It is said that Clifford Odets's 'Waiting for Lefty' made millionaires angry for as long as it took them to get from their seats to where their chauffeurs tactfully waited for them at the end of the block'') was first published in the program of Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' at the National Theater in London in 1965.</p>
        <p>I don't think I ever deplored Odets, but citation of dates brings to mind something more important. The play under discussion, ''Waiting for Lefty,'' opened in 1935. Brecht's play ''The Mother'' opened in New York that same year. The former occasion was a huge success; the latter, a complete flop.</p>
        <p>The juxtaposition has ironic interest. Later, Brecht would be thought of as the leading Communist playwright in all the world, Odets as hardly earning the title Communist playwright at all. Yet there is this too: Odets told the House Committee on Un-American Activities that he had been a party member, albeit only for a few months. He then told which months (in 1934-35) these were. He was in the party on the night ''Waiting for Lefty'' opened in New York.</p>
        <p>As, by the way, was Elia Kazan, that heroic striker in the play. And, as I recall, an early edition of the play contained a note telling us that the play should be interrupted by such announcements as ''In the Soviet Union, anti-Semitism is punished with death.'' What had happened by 1939 was not that critics turned against a playwright, but that Stalin allied himself with Hitler and, among other things, handed German Jewish refugees back to the Germans for continued incarceration and/or death.</p>
