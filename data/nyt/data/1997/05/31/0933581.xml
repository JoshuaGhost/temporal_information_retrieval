        <p>HIDEKI Irabu finally became a New York Yankee yesterday, with no number on the back of the pinstriped jersey he modeled but with a $12.8 million price tag attached to the sleeve. Which raised probing and pertinent questions from the American portion of the attending news media, such as: Is Irabu worth it? And, does he like hot dogs?</p>
        <p>To that first query, George Steinbrenner answered affirmatively, though under cross-examination, the baseball-savvy owner admitted he had never seen Irabu throw so much as a pitch, live or on tape.</p>
        <p>To the second, without even glancing at Kota Ishijima, the Yankees' Pacific Rim director, who was interpreting, Irabu nodded enthusiastically, looking as cheerily fleshy and proud of it as the dearly departed Bambino himself.</p>
        <p>Portly pitchers? No big deal. Steinbrenner has millions invested in David Wells. Spending wildly on a hunch? Kenny Rogers, among others, proves that Steinbrenner has already been there, done that.</p>
        <p>At least, Steinbrenner said, this time he can be reasonably certain that his man is not going to cower under the pressure applied by Steinbrenner and New York, in precisely that order.</p>
        <p>''We've heard a lot of pitchers say they don't want to pitch in New York,'' Steinbrenner said. ''This young man said, 'I only want to pitch in New York.' He stood up to a whole nation.''</p>
        <p>And what are Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. to someone who has blown away what amounted to an international reserve clause with his refusal to let his former Japanese team peddle him to San Diego like some overpriced computer chip?</p>
        <p>There was, naturally, incredulity in the Yankee clubhouse earlier this week when reports surfaced of Irabu's deal, the richest ever for someone who has never played professionally in the United States. Wells said he couldn't believe it. The underpaid Mariano Rivera and Andy Pettitte didn't like it. The overpaid Rogers asked, ''Do we need Irabu?''</p>
        <p>He answered himself on Tuesday night, when Baltimore hit more than a few of his offerings so hard that they might have rolled to Asia if the fence hadn't been in the way.</p>
        <p>There are no sure things, but it is ridiculous to make an issue out of what Irabu is getting. Cuban defectors are handsomely rewarded, and no one knows whom they've pitched against or how old they even are. The Tampa Bay expansion team, Steinbrenner duly noted, just gave $10 million to some high school pitcher. Rogers, to round out this equation of inequity, got $20 million over four years, and seldom gets out of the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>Gordon Blakeley, the one Yankee official who has seen Irabu pitch in Japan, rated Japanese baseball as ''Four A -- above Triple A and below the major leagues.'' If the Yankees had someone in Columbus throwing close to 100 miles an hour, would they not guarantee him millions if they risked losing him altogether?</p>
        <p>On the telephone yesterday from Los Angeles, Dodgers General Manager Fred Claire said that when he signed Hideo Nomo in 1995, he surrendered only a $2 million bonus and a contract for the major league minimum, $109,000. ''But Hideo's made it easier and raised it to the next level,'' Claire said. ''He's proven you can take the step.</p>
        <p>''And this is part of the growth and future of baseball, what's going to raise the level of interest. Let's face it, we haven't made the global progress some of the other sports have. That requires investment and imagination.''</p>
        <p>Take a big bow, Boss. And say this much for George: He is so much more of a showman than most of the dullards who own major league teams. He knows that if Irabu enjoys any success here at all, he could make back much of that $12.8 million before Rogers wins his next game.</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner had to love the Yankee Stadium mob scene yesterday, the Japanese print and electronic journalists passing out business cards and welcoming themselves to what promises to be a long South Bronx stakeout. Their surlier American counterparts may not be looking forward to sharing the manager's office and press room, but their world is changing, shrinking, and if the World Series is ever going to be an event that encompasses the entire baseball-playing world, then the movement has begun with these tales of Hideo and Hideki.</p>
        <p>May they one day meet in the Series, and carry the old Yankee-Dodger rivalry to a new frontier, all the way out to the Pacific Rim.</p>
