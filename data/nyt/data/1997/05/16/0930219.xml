        <p>Time Warner was drawn back into the dispute over ''gangsta'' rap music yesterday, as a small crowd picketed its annual meeting in New York to protest the lyrics of one of its popular rap performers.</p>
        <p>C. DeLores Tucker, a political activist who led a successful campaign against Time Warner's involvement in ''gangsta'' rap two years ago, assailed the company for distributing music by Lil' Kim, a female rap artist known for her lascivious, often sexually explicit, lyrics.</p>
        <p>''Shame on our family, Time Warner, for producing this filth,'' said Ms. Tucker, the chairwoman of the National Congress of Black Political Women, after reading lyrics from songs by Lil' Kim. Ms. Tucker said the music contributed to ''moral corruption'' of young black men and women.</p>
        <p>Gerald M. Levin, the chairman and chief executive of Time Warner, said the company constantly weighed the impact of its music against its commitment to freedom of expression. But he also responded angrily to Ms. Tucker's harsh denunciation, saying, ''The ticket of admission does not give you the right to demean me, or my family.''</p>
        <p>The confrontation injected a discordant note into an otherwise harmonious annual meeting in which Mr. Levin celebrated Time Warner's rising share price and introduced several new executives from the company's acquisition of Turner Broadcasting System.</p>
        <p>Ted Turner, the founder of Turner Broadcasting who is now the vice chairman of Time Warner, kept a low profile at the meeting. But in remarks to reporters afterward, Mr. Turner said of Ms. Tucker, ''I thought she's got a good point, personally.''</p>
        <p>Time Warner has distanced itself from ''gangsta'' rap since 1995, when Ms. Tucker and William J. Bennett, the conservative author and former Secretary of Education, led a campaign against the company and its ties to Interscope Records, a leading distributor of the music.</p>
        <p>Time Warner severed its ties to Interscope in September 1995, and the company was later acquired by the Seagram Company's MCA Inc., now called Universal Studios. Mr. Bennett did not participate in yesterday's protest, which included a dozen people picketing in front of the Apollo Theater, the Harlem landmark where the meeting was held to underscore the company's commitment to the city as well as to highlight its long affiliation with black performers like Quincy Jones.</p>
        <p>James Noonan, a spokesman for Time Warner's music division, noted that Lil' Kim's latest album carries a sticker warning parents of its explicit lyrics. And Mr. Noonan said Lil' Kim represented a tiny fraction of the music distributed by the Warner Music Group.</p>
        <p>Executives at Time Warner did not seem worried that the protest would mushroom into a full-blown controversy like a similar protest by Ms. Tucker at the company's annual meeting two years ago. Nonetheless, they had tried to head off the dispute: Mr. Levin dispatched Time Warner's president, Richard D. Parsons, to Washington on Wednesday to meet with Ms. Tucker.</p>
