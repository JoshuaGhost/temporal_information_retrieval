        <p>For a time, it seemed, the shoes with the very long name occupied a hallowed spot in the closets of the fashionable. Made from alligator or ostrich, Susan Bennis Warren Edwards shoes attracted everyone from Bruce Springsteen to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.</p>
        <p>But late last month, the Shoestore, at 20 West 57th Street, quietly closed. The store's owners, Susan Bennis and Warren Edwards, who also designed the shoes, were evicted by the building's owner, Atco Properties and Management, for failing to pay rent for ''many months,'' said Alan Rosenbluth, a senior vice president at Atco.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bennis and Mr. Edwards declined to comment on the closing.</p>
        <p>A number of factors apparently conspired to hurt business. Though all the rage in the ostentatious 1980's, in recent years the shoes ($695 sandals, for example) were viewed by some as excessive. The store also faced competition from new boutiques selling trendy shoes at lower prices. And the block between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, which seemed so chic when Susan Bennis Warren Edwards arrived in 1990, became less so.</p>
