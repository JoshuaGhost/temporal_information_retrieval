      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Correspondents overwhelmingly wrote that they thought sex education in public schools should include, but not be limited to, teaching abstinence.</p>
        <p>Many 'Right' Answers</p>
        <p>Even in mathematics there can be more than one ''right'' answer to an equation. Educators must take into account that different circumstances, personalities, beliefs, etc., exist in the classes they teach. Students should be provided with an arsenal of choices and with the skills to make the right choice for themselves at the right time. We need responsible citizens, not automatons.</p>
        <p>DEBORAH CONWAY  New Jersey Education Association  Trenton</p>
        <p>Morality vs. Reality</p>
        <p>The core moral message that should be stressed in these courses is that sex is something that comes with marriage and not before. But as we all know, the reality is that most people become sexually active in their teens and that every piece of available information regarding safe sex, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, motherhood and intimacy should be made available through legitimate core curriculums that stress responsibility and abstinence.</p>
        <p>NICK ANTONICELLO  North Arlington</p>
        <p>A Bad Way to Teach</p>
        <p>Questions of effectiveness and actual teen-agers' behavior aside, the deepest problem behind abstinence-only education is that it is bad educational pedagogy by the very fact that it is limited to teaching only one simple lesson on a complex topic. Abstinence-only education for health classes is equivalent to teaching students only one way to interpret a poem or one way of programming a computer. It shortchanges students' ability to solve problems, use critical thinking and decision-making skills, and apply information.</p>
        <p>In fact, abstinence-only education goes out of its way to reinforce to students that they are not able to demonstrate self-management skills and apply safety principles.</p>
