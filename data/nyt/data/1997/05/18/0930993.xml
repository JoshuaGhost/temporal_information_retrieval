      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Larry Towell, 43, who lives on a farm in Ontario, went to the Port Authority Bus Terminal expecting to see ''squalidness and a sense of menace.'' Finding the building sanitized of open crime and homelessness, he gained the confidence of the building's detective squad and was ushered into its detention cell. ''This place radiated the sense of hidden detective work,'' Towell recalls. ''As one officer told me, 'Our job is to hide things.' '' Towell says that the challenge of a documentary photographer is to ''work with what you have, with subjects who are not willing.'' As the detainees at the police holding center were decidedly unwilling, he instead captured the ghostly silhouettes of grease and grime left behind by countless accused felons who had been manacled to a bench there over the years.</p>
