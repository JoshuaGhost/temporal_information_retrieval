        <p>Former officials of the Harlem Urban Development Corporation, responding to criticism from the Pataki administration that their organization was rife with mismanagement and did little in 23 years, are mounting a defense of their record and have dismissed the attacks as politically motivated.</p>
        <p>Donald J. Cogsville, the former president of the defunct Harlem corporation, which for a generation was the prime hope of redevelopment in Harlem, called the criticism from a Pataki administration official a ''hostile, even careless, screed'' and said he was proud of his corporation's record.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cogsville was reacting to a series of audits of the Harlem corporation released 10 days ago by the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's main public development organization. The audits raised questions about financial controls in the Harlem corporation and some of the findings are now under investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney's office and by the State Commission on Investigation.</p>
        <p>On a tour of Harlem this week, Mr. Cogsville pointed to new and renovated housing along 110th Street, rehabilitated housing along Frederick Douglass Boulevard and commercial development on 125th Street, including the Apollo Theater and Mart 125, an indoor market. He said those were among the projects his agency helped bring to fruition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cogsville bitterly rejected the analysis of Empire State officials that the Harlem corporation had little to show for the $100 million in state money it spent over more than two decades. He said his group's role was to help private developers with design and planning and to grant seed money.</p>
        <p>''I never said I had a construction crew out there,'' Mr. Cogsville said.</p>
        <p>The former Harlem corporation officials also said they helped to create more than 4,000 new residences and to rehabilitate an additional 2,400.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cogsville's 12-page response was issued this week by the office of Representative Charles B. Rangel, who was the most influential member of the Harlem corporation's board before it was dissolved by the Pataki administration in 1995. The corporation was replaced by the Harlem Community Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cogsville said the release of the audits by the Empire State officials was intended to ''discredit the elected leadership of Harlem,'' particularly Mr. Rangel.</p>
        <p>Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, dismissed Mr. Cogsville's response as ''a pathetic attempt at revisionist history by a former H.U.D.C. official who is trying to claim credit for the success spearheaded by others in Harlem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cogsville and other former agency officials disputed the allegation by Empire State officials that 20 to 30 percent of the agency's expenditures were not properly documented and that three-quarters of the money was spent on overhead, personnel and consultants.</p>
        <p>Although some of the annual audits of the agency revealed problems with internal financial controls within the Harlem corporation, they did not expose the extreme levels of mismanagement that the Pataki administration is now alleging.</p>
