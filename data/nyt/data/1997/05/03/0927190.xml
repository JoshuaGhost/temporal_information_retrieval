        <p>Subject, Chappaquiddick;  Author, Joyce Carol Oates  'Black Water'  'In an Infinite Universe'  American Theater of Actors</p>
        <p>Although it fits American opera's preoccupation with sensationalistic events of recent memory, Joyce Carol Oates's short novel ''Black Water'' did not seem promising material for musical treatment. A 1992 reimagination of the 1969 drowning incident at Chappaquiddick, Mass., from the point of view of the victim, it began with the car's plunge and kept raising death, in prospect or actuality, claustrophobically, as a sort of incantation around the flashbacks. It offered little on which to hang an extended musical form.</p>
        <p>But an opera there is, with music by John Duffy and libretto by Ms. Oates, in its premiere presentation at the American Music Theater Festival here. Mr. Duffy ''solves'' the musical problem by concentrating on the party leading up to the disaster. But a prevalence of kicky dance tunes and other stock pop material throws off the balance, making the drowning seem merely a drag on a lively evening, with little of the stark immediacy Ms. Oates was seeking.</p>
        <p>Nor does the libretto itself achieve Ms. Oates's initial intent of giving the victim an interesting tale of her own. The character's barely articulate ''I want, I am! I want, I am!'' is the incantation that sticks in the mind here. Far more, it is the other characters that are filled out in the opera, if not always flatteringly.</p>
        <p>Patrick Mason and, especially, Karen Burlingame were wonderfully persuasive in the lead roles, as the Senator and the victim, on Wednesday evening. As decked out here, they also bore remarkable resemblances to Senator Edward M. Kennedy and Mary Jo Kopechne, for all the creators' stated aspiration to allegory rather than literal representation.</p>
        <p>''Black Water'' runs through tomorrow at the Plays and Players Theater, 1714 Delancey Place.</p>
