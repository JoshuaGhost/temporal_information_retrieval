        <p>Having devoted installments of her Making Music series to the works of Steve Reich, Ned Rorem and Alvin Lucier, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich brought the first year of the series to a close on Wednesday evening at Weill Recital Hall by turning the spotlight on her own works as well as a few favorite pieces by other composers.</p>

        <p>Having devoted installments of her Making Music series to the works of Steve Reich, Ned Rorem and Alvin Lucier, Ellen Taaffe Zwilich brought the first year of the series to a close on Wednesday evening at Weill Recital Hall by turning the spotlight on her own works as well as a few favorite pieces by other composers.</p>
        <p>As in the earlier concerts, there was a spoken component. This time, Ms. Zwilich spoke about her goals and creative process and had her performers illustrate some of the thematic transformations in her String Trio.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zwilich, who holds the first Carnegie Hall composer's chair, writes music that is concise, easygoing and accessible, with only the mildest forays into angularity and dissonance to mark it as modern and distinguish it from pure Romanticism. It is, in other words, generally likable and rarely challenging, yet there are always structural signposts to give a listener a sense of place.</p>
        <p>The Intrada (1983), which opened the program, for example, is a bright, energetic piece built on a Stravinsky-like rhythmic figure, but its charm lies in the way its individual lines for flute, clarinet, violin and piano each take on a distinctive character within an expanding musical conversation. The three-movement String Trio (1983) expanded in a different way: its focused Bartokian melody and simple accompaniment were stretched and redistributed, and their ramifications were fully explored during a slowly unfolding metamorphosis.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zwilich's third work was ''Passages'' (1981), an emotional and sometimes powerfully direct song cycle based on poems by A. R. Ammons, with colorful interludes for a wind, string and percussion ensemble. Angelina Reaux sang the settings persuasively, with David Gilbert conducting.</p>
        <p>Earlier, Ms. Reaux gave appallingly overstated performances of Thelonious Monk's ''Around Midnight'' and two Gershwin songs, but she toned down her approach for the Zwilich, to good effect.</p>
        <p>The concert also included a fine, energized account of the Beethoven String Trio in C minor (Op. 9, No. 3) by Jorja Fleezanis, violinist; Paul Neubauer, violist, and Andre Emelianoff, cellist.</p>
        <p>The other musicians who performed were Laura Gilbert, flutist; Marianne Gythfeldt, clarinetist; Christopher Oldfather, pianist, and Pablo Rieppi, percussionist.</p>
