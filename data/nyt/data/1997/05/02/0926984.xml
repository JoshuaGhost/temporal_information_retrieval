        <p>Breaking a four-month silence, the parents of JonBenet Ramsey emphatically proclaimed their innocence today in the killing of their 6-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>The Ramseys spoke at a news conference for local reporters at a hotel suite here. It was one day after John and Patricia Ramsey gave their first formal interviews to the police since Dec. 26, the day Mr. Ramsey emerged from the basement of his home here carrying the body of his daughter.</p>
        <p>''I did not kill my daughter JonBenet,'' Mr. Ramsey, a business executive, said in his first public comments on the case since Jan. 1. ''I will miss her dearly for the rest of my life.''</p>
        <p>Dressed in black, Mrs. Ramsey sat next to her husband, saying at one point: ''I did not have anything to do with it. I loved that child with the whole of my heart and soul.''</p>
        <p>In death, the tiny beauty queen has grown into a national icon.</p>
        <p>But after four months, the Boulder police have not publicly named any suspects. The closest hint came two weeks ago, when Boulder's district attorney, Alex Hunter, responded to a reporter's question about JonBenet's parents, saying, ''Obviously, the focus is on these people.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Ramsey, on the verge of tears, said, ''I'm appalled that anyone would think that John or I would be involved in such a hideous, heinous crime.''</p>
        <p>As browsers on any of the 30 Web sites devoted to the murder mystery know, clues point to a killer who had easy access to the Ramseys' Tudor-style mansion here.</p>
        <p>Detectives who arrived at the crime scene on the morning of the killing found no evidence of forced entry and saw no footprints in the snow around the house. A ransom note, which Mrs. Ramsey said she found, was written on a pad of paper discovered in the house and demanded $118,000, the exact amount of Mr. Ramsey's bonus last year.</p>
        <p>During the four months when the Ramseys declined to talk to the police, they furnished, through their lawyers, the names of at least 10 possible suspects, including disgruntled former employees of Mr. Ramsey's computer company, Access Graphics.</p>
        <p>''Any time spent looking at us is time that's wasted,'' Mr. Ramsey said today. ''The impression that we haven't spoken with police is totally false. What has been delayed is this formal interrogation of us as suspects. We were insulted.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, police detectives repeatedly circled back to the Ramseys, asking friends and former neighbors in Georgia about any history of child abuse, and searching the Ramseys' vacation home in Charlevoix, Mich.,  for handwriting samples.</p>
        <p>''There have also been innuendoes that she has been or was sexually molested,'' Mrs. Ramsey said of her daughter, who was strangled. ''I can tell you those were the most hurtful innuendoes to us as a family.''</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the police asked Mrs. Ramsey for her fifth writing sample. Detectives want to compare  the new samples with the two-and-a-half-page ransom note.</p>
        <p>To date, the Boulder police and district attorney's office have spent about $300,000 investigating the killing, this college town's only murder last year. Mr. Ramsey has also spent heavily, hiring one set of lawyers for himself, another set for his wife, a handwriting analyst, two private investigators and a press spokesman.</p>
        <p>DNA testing was delayed because it took the couple two weeks to respond in March to an offer by Mr. Hunter to have a family representative watch the tests. Only after the Ramseys returned from a weeklong vacation on Sea Island, Ga., did Mr. Ramsey decline the offer.</p>
        <p>Results are expected back next week, but city officials are cautious.</p>
        <p>The DNA tests ''will not make or break this case,'' Boulder's Police Chief, Tom Koby, has warned. The DNA tests appear to be on a bloodstain and on a human tissue found under the little girl's fingernails.</p>
        <p>The Denver Post has reported that no semen was found on the girl's body, in her bedroom or in the basement where her body was found.</p>
        <p>Seeing the case stalled, and refreshed from a quick trip to Aspen, the Ramseys began a public relations offensive last week.</p>
        <p>First, their lawyers, Harold A. Haddon and Patrick Burke, issued a letter lambasting law-enforcement authorities for ''a cowardly smear campaign against John and Patsy fueled by leaks and smear.''</p>
        <p>The lawyers asserted that ''Boulder police refused to release JonBenet's body for burial unless the Ramseys agreed to come to the police station and submit to a hostile interrogation.''</p>
        <p>John Meyer, the Boulder County Coroner, has said that Boulder detectives inquired if the body could be held for a day or two after the autopsy. Mr. Meyer said no and promptly released it for burial.</p>
        <p>''We were absolutely nauseated and appalled, and, frankly, that's when the worm turned,'' Mr. Ramsey said today, implying that this incident provoked him to stop talking to the police for four months.</p>
        <p>Three days after the lawyers' letter hit the press here, the Ramseys purchased a large advertisement in The Boulder Daily Camera, renewing their offer to pay a $100,000 for information about the killer. The advertisement included a kindergarten photograph of JonBenet.</p>
        <p>Then, on Wednesday, the Ramseys submitted to a tape-recorded police interrogation, Mrs. Ramsey for six hours, Mr. Ramsey for two hours.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Ramsey had warm words for the Boulder police and praised Boulder residents.</p>
        <p>''We need that one phone call,'' Mrs. Ramsey said, appealing for a tip on her daughter's killer. Looking at the cameras, she addressed the murderer, saying: ''You may have eluded the authorities. But God knows who you are, and we will find you.''</p>
        <p>During the half-hour conference, Mr. Ramsey described some reporters covering the case as ''cynics.'' But later, skepticism came from other quarters.</p>
        <p>''In the last week, the Ramseys have scored great victories in the court of public opinion,'' said Craig Silverman, who served as a prosecutor in Denver from 1980 until last year. ''You can't help but think that all of this is aimed at a jury, particularly a Boulder jury.''</p>
