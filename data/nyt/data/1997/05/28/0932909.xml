        <p>DUNCAN-Kenneth W., 92 years young, died May 25, at Mary Manning Walsh Home. He brought beauty to life wherever he lived. Turtle Pond is his living memorial, the realization of his dreams as an architectural designer and visionary. As display director and visual merchandiser for forty years, he was a creative force, always ten years ahead of the pack. His influence remains pervasive in stores today. Passionate golfer and billiards player-he held an imaginary cue in his hands two hours before he died. He had knife - sharp wit, enormous warmth, was adored by friends, colleagues, his children, Nick and Laura Jacobs, and by me, Rea, his wife for 38 years. What a love affair. See you at the sea wall, Ken.</p>
