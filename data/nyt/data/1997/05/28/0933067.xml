        <p>The award for best headline and copy went to Goodby, Silverstein &amp; Partners in San Francisco, a unit of Omnicom Group, for its Norwegian Cruise Line campaign. Coincidentally, the trade publication Adweek reported this week that new management at the cruise line was scrapping most of the Goodby, Silverstein work, replacing the agency's sensual campaign with retail-oriented print ads and commercials.</p>
