        <p>Despite hiring the Boeing Company as its lead contractor, the Teledesic Corporation still faces years of challenges to its ambitious plan to establish an ''Internet in the sky'' to deliver high-speed voice and data communications anywhere on the planet.</p>
        <p>The two companies announced on Tuesday that Boeing would receive an estimated $9 billion to design, build and launch more than 250 advanced communications satellites for the start-up company. With the contract, some analysts said, Boeing was beginning to reap the benefits of several huge acquisitions that better positioned the company to enter the satellite business.</p>

        <p>Despite hiring the Boeing Company as its lead contractor, the Teledesic Corporation still faces years of challenges to its ambitious plan to establish an ''Internet in the sky'' to deliver high-speed voice and data communications anywhere on the planet.</p>
        <p>The two companies announced on Tuesday that Boeing would receive an estimated $9 billion to design, build and launch more than 250 advanced communications satellites for the start-up company. With the contract, some analysts said, Boeing was beginning to reap the benefits of several huge acquisitions that better positioned the company to enter the satellite business.</p>
        <p>But the first Teledesic satellite will not enter orbit until 2001 at the earliest, years after some of its likely competitors intend to open shop.</p>
        <p>And even after Boeing committed to invest as much as $100 million to buy up to 10 percent of the company, Teledesic had raised less than 10 percent of the capital it needs, analysts estimated. Such a shortfall may be surprising for a private company founded by two billionaires: Bill  Gates of Microsoft and Craig O. McCaw, North America's cellular telephone pioneer. Together the two men own about 70 percent of Teledesic.</p>
        <p>''Getting Boeing is a positive,'' said Phillip Redman, a wireless communications analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston. ''But there are serious issues that they need to work out very soon. This is on par with landing a man on the moon and the Mir space station. They have an ambitious project ahead of them and they'll have their hands full.''</p>
        <p>Boeing had been trying recently to reduce its dependence on the cyclical commercial aircraft market, which it dominates. Boeing's chairman, Philip M. Condit, announced last year that the company intended to expand its presence in communications and space technology.</p>
        <p>Boeing bought the Rockwell International Corporation's weapons and aerospace units in a $860 million deal last August. Then in December, Boeing announced a $13.3 billion acquisition of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.</p>
        <p>The Rockwell deal made Boeing one of the top manufacturers of satellite components, while McDonnell Douglas had long been one of the leading makers of big rockets.</p>
        <p>''Without those two companies, we would have to go outside for a lot of these things,'' said David Ryan, Boeing's manager for the Teledesic project. ''This is all part of the strategy.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts said they thought Boeing could handle the huge project, but said the Teledesic contract went far beyond Boeing's experience.</p>
        <p>''It's as if someone said, 'We not only want you to build the airplane, but operate it, too, and also build the airport,' '' said Byron K. Callan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Callan suggested that Teledesic might have chosen a more established satellite company, such as the Lockheed Martin Corporation or the Hughes Electronics division of the General Motors Corporation, were those two companies not already involved in other commercial satellite ventures that could possibly compete against Teledesic.</p>
        <p>Teledesic executives shrugged off Boeing's relative inexperience with satellite technology.</p>
        <p>''They have a strong space heritage, but they really haven't been in the satellite business,'' said Russell Daggatt, Teledesic's president. ''But for us that was really a positive. They have no status quo to defend.''</p>
        <p>Teledesic won its first round of approval from the Federal Communications Commission last month. But while he was warily optimistic about the venture's prospects, Wolfgang H. Demisch, an analyst with Bankers Trust New York Corporation, said Teledesic's primary hurdle would be winning approval from regulators in the many foreign countries where it wanted to do business.</p>
        <p>Teledesic may take some comfort that its many competitors will have to run a similar regulatory gantlet. The other emerging satellite companies include a consortium led by Motorola Inc.; a partnership of TRW Inc. and Canada's Teleglobe Inc., and a company controlled by Loral Space and Communications, which is a unit of Lockheed.</p>
        <p>Analysts and executives noted that Boeing and Teledesic might be able to work together especially well because the two companies are based less than 15 miles from one another, in the Seattle area. Boeing shares closed at $98.625, up $2.375, yesterday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>But Teledesic's critics were skeptical that the Boeing deal would answer the venture's fundamental questions.</p>
        <p>''It's not viable; it's never been viable, and it won't be viable,'' said Howard Anderson, the Yankee Group's managing director. ''They're trying to make a technology work in a market that will be oversaturated by the time they launch with a system that will fall under its own overhead.''</p>
