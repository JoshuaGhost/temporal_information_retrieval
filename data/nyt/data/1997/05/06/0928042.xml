        <p>The field was 50 yards shorter and was surrounded by walls. The space between the goalposts was several feet narrower. Only eight men were on the field per team. Receivers went in motion -- backward, often, before moving forward.</p>
        <p>And, best of all for the fans, if the football landed in your hands or in your lap, you kept it.</p>
        <p>In this game of Arena Football, creativity counts. In the New York CityHawks' debut last night at Madison Square Garden, creativity crept up and bit the CityHawks. The Orlando Predators tried to spoil it all, spoil the CityHawks' birth by playing a game of high-strung style and simple arithmetic familiar to Arena Football fans.</p>
        <p>You score. They score. You score. They score. But then the Predators did all the scoring late that counted and won by 50-42.</p>
        <p>''In this game, we made steady improvement,'' said CityHawks Coach Larry Kuharich. ''The purpose is to win. If we win here, the fans will come. I'm sorry the headlines can't say we win. But for the fans that came tonight, I'm sure they will go out and tell others that they saw a pretty good show and that New York has a team they can be proud of.''</p>
        <p>Perry Moss, the Predators' veteran coach, agreed.</p>
        <p>''We know personnel -- that team does not have a soft spot,'' Moss said. ''Their quarterback and their offensive and defensive lines give them a chance to be pretty good. Their skill people are good. But we have a strong team right now.''</p>
        <p>Mike Perez, the CityHawk quarterback, and his teammates fought intensely to bring New York back. New York led, 7-0, early on Fred Coger's 1-yard run. But it would trail Orlando by scores of 14-7, 20-7, 27-14, 30-21, 37-21, 44-28 and 50-35 before losing by 8 points. Five times in the game Orlando built double-digit leads only to see New York cut the margin to single digits.</p>
        <p>''We got off to a shaky start,'' said Perez, a Giant quarterback for stints in the 1988 through 1991 seasons. ''I'd say right now they are the best team in the league. Right now. The key is to hit your peak at midseason and on throughout the playoffs. We have talent here. We just need to get it into sync and tonight was a start.''</p>
        <p>Arena Football is beginning its 11th season. Orlando is beginning its seventh season. For New York, for the CityHawks, this was all new.</p>
        <p>A crowd of 7,422 fans showed up for the game. Among them were Calvin Bridges from Queens Village, his son, Calvin Jr., and his brother, Frank. Frank told Calvin Sr. about the game. Calvin Sr. said he attends Knicks games, Jets and Giants affairs and also watches the Nets.</p>
        <p>''This is pretty good -- it's got a chance,'' Calvin Sr. said. ''It might need a few athletes that people can recognize. That would help. And I paid $35 apiece for my tickets. That's too much.''</p>
        <p>Bill Crouse was there with three of his peers from Kings Point, N.Y., where they attend military school. Crouse is from Lancaster, Ky.</p>
        <p>''This is an action-packed fun game that is a lot different from football I'm used to,'' Crouse said. ''I love being here; there's nothing better to do at my school than this. Hey, the CityHawks have their practices at our school. All the guys are real personal. We were having a beer in the park one day and some of the players came over and had one with us. That was cool. I don't know how many pro guys would do that. We'll be here every time they play.''</p>
        <p>Win or lose?</p>
        <p>''We've got a team that's for real,'' Coger said. ''We will win. Tonight the arithmetic didn't go our way. But we're excited. It was a start.''</p>
