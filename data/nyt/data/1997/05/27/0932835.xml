        <p>State Senator Robert W. Singer, a Republican of Lakewood, said he plans to introduce a bill on June 6 to sharply restrict the privileges of teen-age drivers.</p>
        <p>The measure would require a novice driver to be accompanied by a licensed driver 21 or older for six months and forbid driving between 11 P.M. and 6 A.M. For a year after that, the driver could drive alone, but not between midnight and 6 A.M. except to go to work or religious services. During the entire period, the driver could not have more than one nonfamily member in the car and would have to maintain a spotless record.</p>
