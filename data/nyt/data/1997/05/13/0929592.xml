        <p>The city now calculates those hours based roughly on the $4.75-an-hour Federal minimum wage. For many workers, in exchange for about $100 in welfare benefits each week, they work about 20 hours in jobs like cleaning parks, sweeping sidewalks or doing clerical work.</p>

        <p>A state judge in Manhattan ruled yesterday that New York City's workfare system unfairly calculates the number of hours that more than 35,000 welfare recipients must work to receive benefits.</p>
        <p>The city now calculates those hours based roughly on the $4.75-an-hour Federal minimum wage. For many workers, in exchange for about $100 in welfare benefits each week, they work about 20 hours in jobs like cleaning parks, sweeping sidewalks or doing clerical work.</p>
        <p>But Justice Jane S. Solomon of New York State Supreme Court ruled that the city must base the calculation on what it paid regular city workers for similar tasks, or about $8 to $10 an hour in most cases.</p>
        <p>City officials sought to play down the significance of the decision, saying they would appeal.</p>
        <p>But welfare advocates and lawyers for the workfare employees who brought the lawsuit praised the decision as a breakthrough that could mean that people who are required to work in return for their benefits will be treated more like other workers.</p>
        <p>If the ruling is upheld, they said, the city would probably reduce the number of hours they work each week instead of choosing the more expensive option: increasing welfare benefits by a large margin to reflect the higher prevailing rate.</p>
        <p>One of the most common jobs for workfare employees is cleaning parks. Calculations by City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi found that the comparable pay received by regular, full-time groundskeepers in the city's parks is $9.08 an hour. Another common workfare job is clerical work in social service offices, and the Comptroller said the prevailing rate for that is $8.11 an hour.</p>
        <p>Boris Brukhman, a Ukrainian immigrant who is the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, often does electrical repairs for the city, and the prevailing wage for such work is $18 an hour.</p>
        <p>Marc Cohan, a senior lawyer with the Welfare Law Center, a nonprofit public policy group that brought the lawsuit, said, ''Workfare has done a bad job in moving people from welfare to work, so this decision is good for the workers, because it means they can work less hours and spend more time in education and training programs that will make it easier for them to move from welfare to work.''</p>
        <p>Because of changes in Federal welfare laws, city officials say they may have to put up to 100,000 welfare recipients into workfare jobs in the next few years. Some experts said  Justice Solomon's ruling could ease that task by forcing the city to have  two recipients work, say, 10 hours a week cleaning parks, instead of having one worker do it for 20 hours.</p>
        <p>''To the extent there is a finite amount of work that public agencies need to be done, it will certainly make it easier to spread the work around among participants,'' said Steven Savner, a senior staff lawyer  with the Center for Law and Social Policy, a Washington research group.</p>
        <p>In an oral decision from the bench, Justice Solomon said the city had violated the New York State Constitution and state welfare law, because it has not determined the prevailing wage of the many different jobs done by workfare workers and then not paid the workers whichever is higher, the prevailing wage or minimum wage. She said she would issue a written decision soon.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said: ''The decision will be appealed. Therefore it will have no immediate impact on our ongoing programs. Ultimately, the entire issue will be pre-empted by Federal welfare law.''</p>
        <p>Welfare experts said Justice Solomon's ruling will not take immediate effect if the city appeals, because under state law, injunctions are usually lifted when government bodies appeal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohan, the lawyer for the workfare employees, insisted that City Hall was wrong to assert that Federal welfare law pre-empts all state rules regulating the workfare program. He said state law applies, since most of the city's workfare workers are recipients of Home Relief, which is independent of the new Federal welfare law.</p>
        <p>One welfare advocate who is trying to unionize workfare recipients said the decision goes a long way toward insuring that workfare workers are treated lke regular workers.</p>
        <p>''This decision exposes the myth that these folks are not workers,'' said John Kest, director of organizing for the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. ''It's impossible to maintain the view that these folks are in training programs or doing community service when everyone knows what they're doing is work that city employees used to do.''</p>
        <p>Welfare analysts said the decision would please union leaders who fear that the rapid growth in low-paying workfare jobs will pull down wages and take jobs away from union workers. Requiring cities to pay these workers the equivalent of the prevailing wage is expected to reduce workfare's downward tug on wages, while giving cities less incentive to use welfare recipients to do the work once done by unionized city workers.</p>
