        <p>Timothy J. McVeigh cased the Federal Building in Oklahoma City several months before the bombing in April 1995, and planned to blow it up ''to cause a general uprising in America,'' Mr. McVeigh's former Army friend Michael J. Fortier told a jury here in Federal Court today.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVeigh originally set the hour for the blast at 11 A.M. because ''everybody would be getting ready for lunch,'' Mr. Fortier testified. And when Mr. Fortier protested that the bombing would kill a lot of people, he said Mr. McVeigh replied that he ''considered all those people to be as if they were storm troopers in the movie 'Star Wars.' They may be individually innocent, but because they are part of the evil empire they were guilty by association.''</p>

        <p>Timothy J. McVeigh cased the Federal Building in Oklahoma City several months before the bombing in April 1995, and planned to blow it up ''to cause a general uprising in America,'' Mr. McVeigh's former Army friend Michael J. Fortier told a jury here in Federal Court today.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVeigh originally set the hour for the blast at 11 A.M. because ''everybody would be getting ready for lunch,'' Mr. Fortier testified. And when Mr. Fortier protested that the bombing would kill a lot of people, he said Mr. McVeigh replied that he ''considered all those people to be as if they were storm troopers in the movie 'Star Wars.' They may be individually innocent, but because they are part of the evil empire they were guilty by association.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier also told the jury that at one point Mr. McVeigh suggested that he would stay inside the truck that carried the bomb, so he could shoot anyone who tried to interfere.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier, testifying in the third week of Mr. McVeigh's trial on murder and conspiracy charges in the  bombing at 9:02 A.M. on April 19, 1995, that killed 168 people, said he knew for months of Mr. McVeigh's plans and conceded that he probably could have stopped the bombing with a single telephone call.</p>
        <p>Asked by the lead prosecutor, Joseph H. Hartzler, why he did not, Mr. Fortier said he had no excuse except for his friendship with Mr. McVeigh. ''I'd known Tim for quite a while,'' he said. ''If you don't consider what happened in Oklahoma, Tim is a good person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hartzler, who has said he did not need Mr. Fortier to prove the facts of the case but thought the witness could pull it together for the jury, led Mr. Fortier, step by step, through the events that led to the bombing. Mr. Fortier, who was photographed after the bombing looking shaggy and unkempt, went to court today with a fresh shave and an Ivy  League suit and haircut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier is probably the prosecution's most compelling witness, one who says he can describe Mr. McVeigh's hatred of the Government, and his mind set and activities in the months leading up to the bombing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier, who has pleaded guilty to four charges related to the bombing plot, gave the jury an insider's look at Mr. McVeigh in the months and weeks before the bombing, describing a ride he took with Mr. McVeigh in December 1994,  from Kingman, Ariz., to Junction City, Kan., to pick up some stolen weapons, which prosecutors say were sold to finance the bombing.</p>
        <p>On the highway, he said, they passed a Ryder truck, and Mr. McVeigh told him that was the kind of truck he was considering for the bombing, except that he wanted one  that was a size larger.</p>
        <p>''He would have to stay inside it,'' Mr. Fortier said Mr. McVeigh told him. ''I said that was suicide,'' but Mr. McVeigh said ''he'd stay inside and shoot anyone who tried to stop him.''</p>
        <p>On their way to Kansas, they stopped for 20 minutes in Oklahoma City, and drove around the Federal Building, Mr. Fortier told the jury. He said Mr. McVeigh showed him an alley behind the Y.M.C.A. building across the street from the Federal Building. At that point, Mr. Fortier testified, Mr. McVeigh told him that he had been considering several scenarios for delivering the bomb.</p>
        <p>One was to have Terry L. Nichols, Mr. McVeigh's co-defendant, ''follow and wait for him.'' The other was to deliver a getaway vehicle ''a couple days earlier'' and park it in the alley.  When Mr. Fortier asked him, ''Why not park closer?'' he said Mr. McVeigh replied that ''he wanted a building between him and the blast.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McVeigh also showed Mr. Fortier the loading zone at the Federal Building, Mr. Fortier said, where he hoped to park a bomb-laden truck. His friend also ''made the comment that if he had to, he was going to drive the truck down the stairs and crash it through the front doors.''</p>
        <p>''He told me they picked that building because that was where the orders for the attack on Waco came from,'' Mr. Fortier said. ''He told me -- he also told me that he was wanting to blow up a building to cause a general uprising in America hopefully that would knock some people off the fence into -- and urge them into taking action against the Federal Government.''</p>
        <p>Stephen Jones, the lawyer for Mr. McVeigh, performed a stinging cross-examination of Mr. Fortier this afternoon, and for a while, the members of the jury looked back and forth between lawyer and witness, as if they were watching a tennis match. But Mr. Fortier did not lose his composure. In the morning, when he told the jury that his involvement in the case caused his father to have a nervous breakdown, he wept.</p>
        <p>Throughout the day, Mr. McVeigh hardly looked at his old friend. Instead, he looked at his hands and the table in front of him, occasionally stealing glances at the jury. Mr. Fortier has pleaded guilty to charges that include failing to tell Federal law-enforcement officials of the bombing plot. He faces a maximum penalty of 23 years but is hoping for a reduction of his sentence, which will not be imposed until after the trials of Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols, who will be tried afterward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier, who knew both Mr. Nichols and Mr. McVeigh in the Army, told the jury that Mr. McVeigh first appeared at his trailer in Kingman in April 1993, just after the siege at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier said Mr. McVeigh told him that he and Mr. Nichols had just finished packing for a trip to Texas to demonstrate against the government, when a fire broke out, killing more than 80 Branch Davidians and ending the siege. Mr. Nichols decided to stay home, Mr. Fortier said.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVeigh worked in Kingman that summer, returned to Michigan to live, then came back to Arizona in early 1994, renting a small house near Kingman, in Golden Valley, Mr. Fortier testified. Mr. Nichols lived in Golden Valley with Mr. McVeigh for the first two weeks, Mr. Fortier said.</p>
        <p>At the end of the summer, Mr. Fortier said, he received a letter from Mr. McVeigh, who was traveling to gun shows, in which ''Tim told me that him and Terry Nichols had decided to take some type of positive offensive action. He wanted to know if I wanted to partake of it.'' A week later, Mr. McVeigh was back in Kingman, Mr. Fortier said, and ''we had a conversation near my fence in my front yard. Tim was telling me what he meant by taking action. He told me that he -- him and Terry were thinking of blowing up a building.''</p>
        <p>''He asked me to help them,'' Mr. Fortier continued. ''I turned him down.''</p>
        <p>Later that fall, Mr. Fortier said, Mr. McVeigh called to ask him to rent a storage locker someplace outside Kingman. Mr. Fortier said he was unable to find one.</p>
        <p>Several days later Mr. McVeigh and Mr. Nichols arrived in Kingman and found a storage locker. Later, Mr. Fortier said, the two men  showed him about 12 boxes of explosives in a storage locker. Mr. McVeigh told him later that he and Mr. Nichols had stolen them from a quarry in Kansas, Mr. Fortier said.</p>
        <p>Just before Oct. 31, 1994, Mr. Fortier said, ''Tim said that him and Terry had chosen a Federal Building in Oklahoma City'' and showed him how he could ''make a truck into a bomb.''</p>
        <p>Cross-examination of Mr. Fortier will continue on Tuesday.</p>
