        <p>Editorial tribute to columnist Murray Kempton, who died recently at age 79 (S)</p>
      </abstract>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With his death this week at the age of 79, the distinguished columnist Murray Kempton left an enormous void in his craft. Mr. Kempton was as comfortable with Chekhov or Shakespeare as with the police blotter. When he covered the courts, divorce and corruption cases would remind him of plots from the Greek tragedies.</p>
        <p>He got to know his subjects at close range and was thus able to separate the myth from the reality. Where others saw cardboard characters of the urban morality play, Mr. Kempton saw complex figures and the frailties behind sometimes fearsome reputations. In one column he described mobsters as the slaves of our credulous imaginations:  ''They are, after all, that precious asset to journalism, men who have crossed the shadow line beyond which they can no longer sue for libel and where they can thus be blamed, with impunity, for everything.''</p>

        <p>With his death this week at the age of 79, the distinguished columnist Murray Kempton left an enormous void in his craft. Mr. Kempton was as comfortable with Chekhov or Shakespeare as with the police blotter. When he covered the courts, divorce and corruption cases would remind him of plots from the Greek tragedies.</p>
        <p>He got to know his subjects at close range and was thus able to separate the myth from the reality. Where others saw cardboard characters of the urban morality play, Mr. Kempton saw complex figures and the frailties behind sometimes fearsome reputations. In one column he described mobsters as the slaves of our credulous imaginations:  ''They are, after all, that precious asset to journalism, men who have crossed the shadow line beyond which they can no longer sue for libel and where they can thus be blamed, with impunity, for everything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kempton wrote aggressively of the local -- even after cable television, satellite dishes and the Internet began sending torrents of news from faraway places. He was at home on virtually any topic, but this local lens was deliberately sought. Writing in his 70th birthday column, he said: ''I write every day for the next and walk wide of the cosmic and settle most happily for the local, a precinct less modest than I make it sound, since my local happens to be the only city under the eye of God where the librettist for 'Don Giovanni' could find his closest friend in the author of 'The Night Before Christmas.' ''</p>
        <p>Baroque sentences and an easy familiarity with literature and history were Mr. Kempton's hallmarks, whether writing for The New York Post, Newsday or The New York Review of Books. A trim figure in a suit and oxfords, he traveled the city on his bike, going over and over New York, as though thumbing the pages of a favorite book.</p>
        <p>He was an unparalleled seer of persons and stories, a delicious blend of reporter, philosopher and ironist. Those who knew him, whether from his writings or from personal contact, will miss his dignity, grace and craftsmanship.</p>
