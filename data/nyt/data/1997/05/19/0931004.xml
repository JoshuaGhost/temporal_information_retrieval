      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Nina Ananiashvili roared through ''Swan Lake'' on Saturday night at the Metropolitan Opera House as if she had been born dancing the role. It was clear that ''Swan Lake'' was in the Russian ballerina's blood and bones the way it could not be for her peers at American Ballet Theater. But those dancers, on Saturday and Wednesday nights, had subtleties of their own.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ananiashvili's evil third-act Odile looked as if she had been shot out of a cannon, with little connection to anyone around her. The pyrotechnics were exciting, but it was left to Guillaume Graffin, her prince, to suggest the passions of the moment in whipped-off a la seconde turns filled with love, despair and fervent competition. Ms. Ananiashvili and Mr. Graffin achieved the closest and most moving rapport in the often dull final act. The ballerina's broken-bodied white swan, arms rippling sensuously, was affecting throughout, but Mr. Graffin was a remote lover.</p>

        <p>Ms. Ananiashvili's evil third-act Odile looked as if she had been shot out of a cannon, with little connection to anyone around her. The pyrotechnics were exciting, but it was left to Guillaume Graffin, her prince, to suggest the passions of the moment in whipped-off a la seconde turns filled with love, despair and fervent competition. Ms. Ananiashvili and Mr. Graffin achieved the closest and most moving rapport in the often dull final act. The ballerina's broken-bodied white swan, arms rippling sensuously, was affecting throughout, but Mr. Graffin was a remote lover.</p>
        <p>Charles Askegard and Julie Kent took on the roles on Wednesday in a quieter performance. Like Mr. Graffin, Mr. Askegard must rely not on dazzling pyrotechnical skill but on presence and interpretation as the prince. But Mr. Askegard looked so uncomfortable that there was only his elegantly long body line and sensitive partnering to admire. Ms. Kent turned in her usual imaginatively thought-out and exquisitely phrased performance. Now it is time for her to let loose.</p>
        <p>The corps and orchestra appeared a little the worse for wear by Saturday night, the seventh performance of ''Swan Lake'' in Ballet Theater's opening week. But Ethan Stiefel stood out for his fluid attack in the Neapolitan duet on Saturday, with Parrish Maynard impressive in his strong, pure virtuoso dancing on Wednesday. Both were paired with the exuberant Angel Corella. Brian Reeder made Von Rothbart a figure of unusual and interestingly youthful vigor on both nights.</p>
