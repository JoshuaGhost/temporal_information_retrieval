        <p>Garth Snow was knocked out today, the victim of a standing-five count. One, two, three, four, five goals on 10 shots, most of which he could have stopped, and the white towel was waved by his corner man, Terry Murray, the Flyers' coach.</p>
        <p>Out went Snow, the Flyers' starting goalie in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Rangers, and in came Ron Hextall. And with it, ignition sequence was started anew on a controversy over Murray's handling of his goalies during the playoffs.</p>
        <p>It is a subject that clearly agitates Hextall, who does not need much to get him agitated anyway. Told after the game that Murray said he would start Game 3 on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, Hextall answered in a weary voice, ''He hasn't told me yet.''</p>
        <p>''This is all new territory for me,'' Hextall added.</p>
        <p>Hextall had been the Flyers' No. 1 goalie through most of the season, but after a late-season swoon, Murray appeared to lose confidence in him. Snow was the surprise starter when the playoffs began.</p>
        <p>Snow won four of five starts against the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round, and three of four starts against the Buffalo Sabres in the second round. Hextall got the series-clinching victory against Buffalo, but when the series against the Rangers began Friday, Snow was back in the net, and gave up only a last-minute goal in a 3-1 victory.</p>
        <p>But today, Snow was yanked 33 minutes 45 seconds into the game. After the fifth goal, with the Flyers trailing by 5-3, Hextall came on.</p>
        <p>Hextall was tested quickly in his relief appearance. Moments after stepping on the ice, he stopped a point-blank shot from the slot by the Rangers' Esa Tikkanen. And he turned aside 11 other shots.</p>
        <p>''Hextall came on and played well,'' Murray said. ''He was basically in a cleanup role. I thought he played sharp. Snowy was not the same.''</p>
        <p>And now Hextall will take over. Tuesday will mark only his third appearance since the playoffs began.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather play the next one having played today,'' Hextall said. ''This makes it easier. It makes it so I can't say I've only played once in 40 days.''</p>
        <p>The sloppy goaltending was one of several areas that plagued the Flyers. They were unable to properly adjust to the Rangers' playing Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier on the same line. ''That wasn't something I expected,'' Murray admitted.</p>
        <p>The Rangers' frequent substitutions -- often immediately after face-offs in their defensive zone -- minimized the advantage in shuffling lines that a home team should enjoy.</p>
        <p>And the Flyers were unable to use their size to their best advantage because the pace of the game was quick, with plenty of open ice that allowed the Rangers' forwards to dart stealthily with a minimum of interference. And when the aggressiveness of the game was ratcheted up several notches, the Flyers could not intimidate the Rangers.</p>
        <p>As time ran out, Eric Lindros, the Flyers' captain, had his face being held to the ice by Ranger defensemen Jeff Beukeboom and Ulf Samuelsson.</p>
        <p>''When you've got the puck and the chance to score with a couple seconds left and someone has their two hands wrapped around your head, it makes it somewhat difficult to score,'' Lindros said.</p>
        <p>Goal-scoring is not a concern for the Flyers, whose offensive lines come in waves, like fighter planes. They are solid on defense too. But their goaltending is their weak spot, and the Rangers exposed it today.</p>
        <p>The Rangers' first goal was scored when Doug Lidster's soft shot from the point trickled through Snow's legs. ''I got enough of a look at that shot that I should have made the save, and I didn't,'' Snow said.</p>
        <p>Gretzky then scored twice on goals in which his deft handling of the puck confused Snow.</p>
        <p>A dump-in pass that bounced awkwardly off the boards found Snow out of position, and Gretzky was able to gather the puck in his skates and quickly shovel a backhand past Snow. Nearly two minutes later, at 9:34 of the first period, Snow tried to stop a pass that was headed to Gretzky behind the net. He missed it, was caught out of the crease, and Gretzky immediately flipped the puck into the crease, where it glanced off the skate of Flyer defenseman Karl Dykhuis and across the goal line.</p>
        <p>On Gretzky's third goal, and the Rangers' fourth, Snow tried to glove Gretzky's 40-foot blast, but it hit his glove and bounced into the net.</p>
