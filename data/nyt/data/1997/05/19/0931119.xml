        <p>WILLIAM D. WALSH is not a man to hold a grudge. In 1947, his first year at Fordham University, he was cut from the football team by the freshman coach, Vince Lombardi.</p>
        <p>Last week, the university announced that Mr. Walsh, a trustee and venture capitalist who lives in Atherton, Calif., is giving $500,000 to improve the athletic center at the university's Rose Hill campus in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''I am the chairman of the subcommittee on athletics, and when I walked through the facilities, it was clear that something needed to be done,'' Mr. Walsh said.</p>
        <p>He is also donating $10 million for a library, in the final stages of construction in the Bronx. It will be named the Walsh Library, and Mr. Walsh speculated, ''Students of the future will wonder who that was.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walsh, who graduated from Fordham in 1951, said: ''Fordham is a school that can be characterized as educating a great number of America's first-generation children. Like so many others, I was there when my family had no excess cash, and I worked as a theater barker and a hospital oxygen technician.''</p>
