        <p>Early last month, the broadcast television industry received what critics have said is the kind of ''corporate welfare'' benefit that many television news programs love to expose. Ending a three-year fight, the Government lent the industry, free of charge, new space on public airwaves worth $7 billion to $15 billion, according to Federal estimates.</p>
        <p>The fact that broadcasters prevailed is seen by many as an example of the power and prowess of the television lobby in Washington. But what has really upset critics is that the industry is resisting efforts by President Clinton and campaign finance reformers to provide free ''public interest'' television air time for political candidates.</p>
        <p>''Broadcast television is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in town,'' said Don Simon, executive director of Common Cause, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''This giveaway is the corporate welfare program to end all corporate welfare programs. Now, after broadcasters have been given the free use of public airwaves, candidates have to raise huge sums of money to buy it back. It's crazy.''</p>
        <p>The extra channel space, in fact, is intended to replace existing spectrum that broadcasters are to give back to the Government in nine years. But within a week of last month's decision on lending new airwaves, the head of the National Association of Broadcasters argued that the broadcasters should get to keep both sets of channels for some unspecified time beyond 2006.</p>
        <p>Edward O. Fritts, president of the industry trade group, would not comment for this article. But in a speech last month, he decried the notion of federally required free air time for candidates as ''unconstitutional.''</p>
        <p>In a separate interview recently, he said his industry already faced burdensome regulations: ''We have more regulation than any other organization or business that I can think of. And we have a list of proposed regulations that is longer than any business I can think of.''</p>
        <p>The nature of the industry's public service obligations has been the focus of debate in Washington for the last two years. First there was a debate over broadcasting three hours of educational programming a week, a proposal the industry accepted. Then there was the argument over what kind of ratings system, if any, should be adopted for prime-time programming. More recently, there has been the question of whether political candidates should get  free air time.</p>
        <p>But no issue had a greater impact on the industry's finances than the question of providing broadcasters the use of airwaves for digital television transmissions, and what obligations, financial or otherwise, the industry should accept in return.</p>
        <p>The benefit the industry recently received is new space on the broadcast spectrum -- made available to more than 1,500 television stations -- to begin to introduce the next generation of television using digital signals with the potential of offering movie-quality pictures and CD-quality sound. In addition, broadcasters can use the new space for anything else -- like pagers, interactive games or Internet access -- that will fit into these airwaves and create revenue.</p>
        <p>This benefit contrasts sharply with the situation faced by other industries that have recently received access to the nation's airwaves. Since 1993, the Federal Communications Commission has been auctioning off spectrum space to cellular phone and direct-broadcast satellite companies and has received companies' commitments to pay $12 billion in return.</p>
        <p>Broadcast television is the lone industry, F.C.C. officials say, that Congress has said does not have to pay for the use of previously unused space on the nation's airwaves, which are public property.</p>
        <p>''Broadcasters receive substantially more from the political process than they give to it,'' said Reed E. Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman, another industry critic. ''They have received hundreds of millions of dollars from candidates who buy time on their airwaves. They make a lot of money at it. At the F.C.C., they are the most powerful lobbying group. It's been that way for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>The broadcast industry has power in Washington for two reasons: It spends millions in campaign donations and on high-powered lobbyists that work Congress and the F.C.C, according to Federal filings analyzed by watchdog groups like Common Cause.</p>
        <p>More important, however, the industry has the power of television: Its stations nationwide determine how politicians are portrayed to their voters back home.</p>
        <p>''The broadcast industry's power isn't necessarily that their campaign contributions get them the results that they seek,'' said Gigi B. Sohn, executive director of the Media Access Project, a nonprofit telecommunications law firm. ''It's the fact that each broadcaster has incredible control over how much a politician gets access to his constituency. It's the local broadcaster who decides whether a particular senator is worthy of news when he cuts a ribbon at a shopping center.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fritts of the National Association of Broadcasters has long been an advocate of continuing broadcasters' traditional free access to the airwaves that carry their signals and an opponent of giving free air time to candidates. ''There are those in Washington who would impose Government-mandated speech to enhance their personal and political agendas,'' he said at the industry's convention in Las Vegas, Nev., last month. ''We cannot let that happen.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fritts heads an association with a $35 million annual budget. It represents 85 percent of network-affiliated television stations and 40 percent of independent stations. He also has close personal connections with the current Congressional leadership. He was a college roommate of Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, at the University of Mississippi 35 years ago. Last summer, Senator Lott and a few other Congressional leaders pushed the F.C.C. to award the broadcast licenses free, as required under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, by this April -- with little Congressional dissent.</p>
        <p>A report issued last month by Common Cause showed that in the last 10 years the broadcast industry has led a deep-pocketed lobbying effort in Washington and has been generous to Congressional campaigns. This pace stepped up in 1995 and 1996 as even richer corporate parents acquired the big networks, with Walt Disney buying ABC and Westinghouse Electric getting CBS.</p>
        <p>The Common Cause report shows that in the last decade the broadcast television interests and their corporate parents have given more than $9 million in political donations: $6 million from the political action committees of the four main networks and the broadcasters association, as well as $3 million in soft-money donations to the two parties from large broadcasters, their parent corporations and the broadcasters association.</p>
        <p>The Common Cause report includes political donations by Walt Disney in the years before it bought Capital Cities/ABC, because, its authors argue, the good will from these earlier donations is now being put in play for broadcasters. The report's authors also say that corporate parents like Disney; the News Corporation, which owns the Fox television network, and General Electric, which owns NBC, do have legislative interests beyond broadcasting. However, Common Cause decided to count their overall corporate contributions as broadcast related, believing that the long-term relationships cemented by a decade of contributions are being used to further the broadcasters' agenda.</p>
        <p>In the 1995-96 election season cycle, broadcasters and their owners were among the biggest corporate donors, giving $3.5 million to both Democrats and Republicans at the national party level. Among the big givers were General Electric/NBC ($849,555), Walt Disney/ABC ($763,000), News Corporation/Fox ($684,000), the National Association of Broadcasters ($507,007) and Westinghouse/CBS ($442,000). The News Corporation figure includes a last-minute $250,000 donation to the National Republican Senatorial Committee by Anna Murdoch, the wife of the company's chief executive, Rupert Murdoch.</p>
        <p>The report does not, however, include Mr. Murdoch's $1 million contribution to the California Republican Party.</p>
        <p>In addition to campaign donations, the entire broadcast industry spent more than $10.7 million in lobbying for the first six months of 1996, the most current statistics, according to the report.</p>
        <p>''This industry has worked tirelessly since the late 1980's to get this outcome for HDTV,'' said Andrew Blau, a director at the Benton Foundation, a nonprofit research group. ''They are focused and single-minded on the issue of HDTV. It's seen as being so complicated that it hasn't become a big public story. But, the airwaves are a public resource even though, time and again, broadcasters treated it as private stuff.''</p>
        <p>Paul Taylor, executive director for the Free TV for Straight Talk Coalition, said in an interview that broadcasters are loath to give up 30-second spots for campaign advertisements, not because they fear giving up time, but because they fear that audiences in this channel-surfing era will quickly switch to another program. Offers of time by the industry to candidates have either been at time slots or in formats that are not useful to the candidates, Mr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor continued: ''Broadcasters simply didn't cover the story about HDTV. Here was a big public policy issue and it never got much visibility. Yet it's a staple of broadcast journalism -- stories about the 'Fleecing of America' and 'It's Your Money' -- and this never got covered.''</p>
        <p>Bill Pitts, vice president for government affairs at ABC, said that networks, his and at least one other, had done stories on digital high-definition television and added that free television time ''won't take the money out of politics.''</p>
        <p>''Politicians will still want to buy broadcast air time,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor's proposal for free time gained some powerful supporters last March when it was endorsed by both President Clinton and Mr. Hundt of the F.C.C. Mr. Clinton specifically recommended that the broadcasters provide free air time in exchange for the new HDTV licenses and issued an executive order creating an advisory panel to examine broadcasters' public interest obligations.</p>
