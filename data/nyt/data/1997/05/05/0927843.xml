        <p>Charles Franchino letter disputes May 1 editorial on ABC-TV sitcom Ellen, in which title character played by Ellen DeGeneres who is lesbian in real life, announces she is gay (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 1 editorial insinuates that President Clinton was ambushed by a couple of lesbians looking to make a political point by being photographed with the President at the White House Correspondents Dinner. Anyone with any political sense knows that this President is the most media-savvy to date. It's a safe bet that he was photographed with two lesbians embracing one another because he wanted to be and felt that there was political advantage to be gained.</p>
