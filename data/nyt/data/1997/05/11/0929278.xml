        <p>JOE CAMEL may not be dead yet, but Luke Lion is working to expedite his quick departure. Luke, a cheerful cartoon-like character who promotes nonsmoking, was developed by Ellen Shapiro of Irvington, a designer, working with Jessica Schwartz of Tarrytown, vice president of communications for the American Cancer Society's New York City division.</p>
        <p>For four weeks beginning in mid-March, 6,000 New York City children, in grades 4 through 6 in 40 public and private schools, took part in the anti-smoking curriculum ''Luke Lion's March Against Tobacco.'' The chapter wants Luke Lion to be adopted by other American Cancer Society chapters nationwide and accepted not just as an anti-smoking symbol but also as a mascot for healthy living.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shapiro, a graphic designer and writer, is the owner of her own company, Shapiro Design Associates in Manhattan. To find the right look for Luke, she tested sketches in classrooms at the Dows Lane School in Irvington. The selected sketch was done by George Toomer of Dallas.</p>
        <p>Here are excerpts from a recent conversation with Ms. Shapiro:</p>
        <p>Q. What does a designer do?</p>
        <p>A. They taught us in school that designers are the people in society who determine how things look. Kind of a heavy obligation. Posters, packages, stationery, brochures, anything with lettering. But today we're doing a lot more than that -- we're determining what things say, especially with computers now part of the mix.</p>
        <p>Q. You were not the illustrator on the Luke Lion campaign. What are the different roles?</p>
        <p>A. Some designers are illustrators, but most designers are more like the movie producer or the orchestra conductor, in that we take charge of the overall shape and content of a piece or campaign -- the look and feel of it, the color, the style, the paper stock, the typography and all of the production aspects. We get the project conceived to solve the client's communication's problems. Very often we will hire an illustrator for the project who might paint in oils or draw in pen and ink or, increasingly, work on a computer.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you get involved with the anti-smoking project?</p>
        <p>A. I had a call from a colleague, Alan Kay, chairman of the ad agency Cory Kay and Partners. He called me up and said, How would you like to do another semi pro bono job? The client, Jessica Schwartz, had known him from a previous job. She went to visit Cory Kay to talk about her idea about having a youth advocacy anti-smoking campaign in March and wanted to get some creative ideas from him.</p>
        <p>I think together they brainstormed the idea of developing a character, Luke Lion. Alan had actually sketched out a Luke. I loved the idea of the character, but I wasn't sure that his was the character that was going to touch the kids -- New York City urban kids. As the mother of a son, I wasn't really sure that character would move them, and I wasn't sure which direction we should go with. What would kids like? So we had three different illustrators draw different Luke Lions to test them.</p>
        <p>Q. So in this case you used a sketch by George Toomer?</p>
        <p>A. Right. I had three different illustrators draw their concept of Luke Lion. I asked them all to be of Luke playing basketball. We ended up with three very different Lukes. I would say one was a very abstract Luke, geometric and very small and skinny. We had a very traditional children's book illustration of Luke. And George Toomer's Luke was clearly the comic-book-style cartoon look.</p>
        <p>Q. How did you decide which one was best?</p>
        <p>A. Jessica appreciated my offer to have three different illustrators do sketches and test them with kids because I really had no idea what kids were going to like. My taste was not going to be what drove this project to be successful. She had two kids in Dows Lane School in Irvington, and my son had gone there. So we decided to test it there, because we knew the principal, Joseph Rodriguez. We were on a fast track on this. The whole project was done in about two and a half months. I also went to the to middle school to talk to some kids in the cafeteria about Luke.</p>
        <p>Q. What did the kids like about George Toomer's Luke?</p>
        <p>A. George's Luke is kind of short and young and has these dreadlocks -- these were all the things the kids responded to during our informal market research. They told us they wanted him to be young, cute and friendly and to be a little bit more competent. The idea is for him to be to the 9-, 10-  and 11-year-old set what Joe Camel is to 15-, 16-, 17-  or 18-year-olds: someone who can do things that are not totally out of reach but are considered cool by that age group. Luke can ride a skateboard well. He can play the electric guitar. And kids can do those things and also turn down cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Q. Why do these things make a difference? Why does a pre-teen or teen-ager care whether Joe Camel tells him to smoke or Luke Lion tells him not to?</p>
        <p>A. I can only tell you the results of what we saw at the end of the program. They had what they called ''the roaring rally'' at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan, and nearly 1,000 kids came out for it in the pouring rain. They had a Luke Lion character dressed in a costume, and the kids started stomping their feet, yelling: ''We want Luke. We want Luke.'' It was just amazing to see those kids yelling and wanting to touch him and get his autograph.</p>
        <p>The American Cancer Society's timing with Luke is excellent with everything going on now with settlements of some of the anti-smoking lawsuits. Part of the settlement may entail getting rid of Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. These are very powerful images that work through suggesting you can be like him.</p>
        <p>Q. What beyond images did the anti-smoking campaign include?</p>
        <p>A. This was the New York City pilot program presented to fourth-, fifth-  and sixth-grade teachers in New York City as health curriculum they could do in their classrooms. A brochure went out to schools and teachers introducing the program: here's Luke and he's a cool cat, and his four-week march against tobacco is ready to roar in your classroom starting March 17. And we have a picture of Luke on the inside turning away cigarettes that are being offered by a donkey and a sheep.</p>
        <p>Part of the curriculum was figuring out how much it costs to smoke for a year. Another part was to take a look at all the techniques that tobacco companies use to convince people to smoke -- how they make smokers look athletic and healthy, and so forth. They also had kids write letters to elected officials supporting Peter Vallone's legislation, the New York City Council Speaker, to keep billboards more than 1,000 feet away from schools.</p>
        <p>Across the street from the middle school where we had shown our original sketches is a popular lunch place called This and That Shop. Right over the counter, where all the kids are buying their sandwiches and burritos for lunch, is a giant poster showing three bare-chested Joe Camels out smoking and driving what looked to be a pink 1957 Chevy along the Pacific Coast Highway. These are very slick, well-crafted images, and that's the whole point of the society's curriculum -- to give kids the understanding and the tools that they need to be able to counter this.</p>
        <p>Q. Do you think it will work?</p>
        <p>A. The question is whether by the time the kids are 16 peer pressure will have taken over. So another part of the curriculum is to teach them about peer pressure -- what it means and how to say no. It can be used not only when somebody offers you a cigarette but in a lot of other situations in life when people would want to say no.</p>
        <p>Q. Have you ever personally been involved in this type of campaign, one that has the potential to evolve into something important?</p>
        <p>A. Not exactly, but there are different types of successes. For example, a newsletter that we do for the Institute of Mental Health Initiatives goes out four times a year to 20,000 screenwriters, producers and directors. It's about how to portray human emotions in the movies and television to support mental health.</p>
