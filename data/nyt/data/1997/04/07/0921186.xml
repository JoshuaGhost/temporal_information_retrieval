      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Clinton Administration's decision last week to allow the Lockheed Martin Corporation to submit a technical bid for sales of F-16 fighter planes to Chile is being widely viewed as the end of a United States ban on high-technology arms sales to Latin America.</p>
        <p>While Administration officials say that President Clinton has not yet approved any sale of fighter planes to Chile, they acknowledged that permitting Lockheed to discuss technical and pricing information on the F-16 with the Chilean Government gives a strong indication that the United States is on the verge of relaxing the ban.</p>
        <p>''It is very rare for the Government to release this data and then not allow the sale to go through,'' said an Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''The final decision is still under review, but we wanted to allow American companies to submit bids to Chile before its March 31 deadline.''</p>
        <p>In Santiago, Gen. Fernando Rojas Vender, head of the Chilean Air Force, expressed joy that the United States had allowed American weapons makers to take part in the bidding, saying Lockheed's technical bid on the F-16 was ''a very important step forward.''</p>
        <p>Chile, which is seeking to buy at least 20 advanced fighter planes, has said that it is interested in Lockheed's F-16 but that it is also considering buying planes from other countries that have no restrictions, including Swedish JAS-39 Gripen and French Mirage 2000-5 fighters.</p>
        <p>Even Argentina, which has opposed lifting the United States weapons ban for fear of a regional arms race, has shifted its position, apparently conceding that United States arms sales to Latin America are inevitable.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Argentina's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that while his Government is still strongly opposed to a regional arms buildup, it is not concerned whether the United States removes or maintains the ban, especially since Argentina has no conflicts with its neighbors.</p>
        <p>Military analysts said Argentina initially opposed relaxing the United States ban because it could not afford to buy the advanced weapons because of sharp budget cutbacks.</p>
        <p>Argentina's military spending has declined 75 percent in the last 10 years after the country's return to democracy from military dictatorship. Meanwhile, Chile, which has the strongest economy in Latin America, has increased its military budget, which by law receives a substantial percentage of the country's copper revenues.</p>
        <p>The analysts have said that the sale of F-16's would change the balance of air power in South America to favor Chile, which would have technology far superior to Argentina's, unless the Argentines also came up with the money to buy F-16's.</p>
        <p>''This is about military prestige,'' said Wendy Hunter, a professor of political science at Vanderbilt University. ''Argentina doesn't think that if the Chileans get new F-16's that they will come charging over the Andean ice field and attack them. Argentina is embarrassed because by comparison it has very little money to spend on new weapons and believes that without superior firepower, it doesn't have prestige.''</p>
        <p>While Argentina, a close United States ally, is publicly saying that it is no longer concerned about the possible lifting of the American arms ban, Government officials from both countries confirmed that Argentina is still lobbying the Clinton Administration not to allow the sale to Chile, or at the very least to permit the sale of less-advanced F-16's.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some Chilean military officials have said that they are worried that in its final decision, the United States will not sell Chile the latest generation of F-16's, a move the Chilean military officials said could force them to take their business elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said the decision to allow Lockheed to bid for Chile's fighter planes was due mainly to pressure by United States weapons contractors who maintain that the arms ban is preventing them from competing in a potentially lucrative market that is open to foreign competitors.</p>
        <p>The American weapons contractors cite Peru's recent purchase of a dozen Russian MIG-29's at a cost estimated at $350 million -- business the weapons contractors say is needed to preserve jobs in the United States.</p>
        <p>But critics of relaxing the United States arms ban say that democracy is still very fragile in Latin America and that many countries do not have full civilian control over their armed forces and thus are ill equipped to regulate the new military technology.</p>
        <p>They point to Peru's MIG purchase as another sign that the military can override other domestic and even regional concerns. While other South American countries have larger air forces than Peru's, United States analysts who assess the balance of power in Latin America said that Peru's Russian MIG's were the most advanced. The Russian MIG-29 fighter performs air interception and air-to-ground missions, military analysts say, that are not very useful in the kind of jungle wars that Peru has fought.</p>
        <p>''While I don't see an immediate arms race developing in the region, I do see these advanced weapons purchases contributing to destabilizing relations between countries,'' said Sarah Walkling, a senior analyst for the Arms Control Association, a Washington-based research agency.</p>
