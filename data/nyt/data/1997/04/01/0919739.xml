        <p>They look like gargantuan worms. They act like gargantuan worms. And a new study in the March 20 issue of the journal Nature suggests that they move like worms.</p>
        <p>But they are actually slithering, tropical amphibians known as caecilians. And their squishing, squeezing type of locomotion has never before been seen in vertebrate animals.</p>
        <p>Biologists had long assumed that caecilians, legless relatives of frogs and salamanders, moved through their underground burrows like  snakes. A snake plants one curve of its S-shaped body and pushes off from that anchor point, much as a human rock climber in a crevice would alternate pushing away from a rock wall with hands and feet.</p>
        <p>But unlike snakes, whose bodies are relatively rigid, caecilians are ''just a big sack of fluid,'' said James O'Reilly, a graduate student at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Mr. O'Reilly carried out the study with Dale Ritter and Dr. David Carrier, herpetologists at Brown University in Providence, R.I.</p>
        <p>So caecilians employ a sort of water-balloon method of movement. Using the unusual, and hitherto unexplained, arrangement of muscles ringing its body, a caecilian squeezes itself tight, forcing its squishy, flexible body to elongate and propelling its head forward. Then the rest of the body follows.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Reilly compared the movement to that of an earthworm, an octopus tentacle or human tongue. ''Yeah,'' he said, ''they're really weird.''</p>
