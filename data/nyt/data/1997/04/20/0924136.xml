        <p>Brett Pulley examines rift between US Sen Robert Torricelli and group of black New Jersey ministers, who have accused him of failing to live up to campaign promise to appoint African-American as one of top three people on his staff; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Enormous political might, like the type often realized by newly elected officials, must be as intoxicating as a stiff cocktail -- erasing inhibitions, clouding the senses, and distorting one's judgment. As evidence of this unproved theory, take Robert G.

        <p>A few weeks ago, as he was still settling in for six years in his new office in Washington, Mr. Torricelli received a letter from a group of black New Jersey ministers, accusing the Senator of breaking a campaign promise. ''During the campaign, you committed yourself to have one of the top three people on your staff to be an African-American,'' the letter from the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey stated, referring to a private meeting the ministers had with Mr. Torricelli last October when he was seeking their support in the election. ''This commitment was not kept,'' the letter read.</p>

        <p>Enormous political might, like the type often realized by newly elected officials, must be as intoxicating as a stiff cocktail -- erasing inhibitions, clouding the senses, and distorting one's judgment. As evidence of this unproved theory, take Robert G. Torricelli, the freshman Senator who found himself in a close race last fall but still won by 10 percentage points because of a strong turnout among minority voters.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, as he was still settling in for six years in his new office in Washington, Mr. Torricelli received a letter from a group of black New Jersey ministers, accusing the Senator of breaking a campaign promise. ''During the campaign, you committed yourself to have one of the top three people on your staff to be an African-American,'' the letter from the Black Ministers Council of New Jersey stated, referring to a private meeting the ministers had with Mr. Torricelli last October when he was seeking their support in the election. ''This commitment was not kept,'' the letter read.</p>
        <p>True to form, Mr. Torricelli responded with the intrepidity of a barroom brawler. Calling the ministers' letter ''uninformed, inaccurate, and unimaginable,'' Mr. Torricelli wrote back defending his record of hiring staff members who are minorities. He attacked the ministers, who represent about 500 churches, accusing them of lying about his having promised to fill a top post with a black person. His office issued a statement saying that the group's executive director, the Rev. Reginald T. Jackson, has ''a severe credibility problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli then tried, unsuccessfully, to divide the black ministers around the state on the issue, instead of resolving it with Mr. Jackson and his group.</p>
        <p>Over the past few weeks, as the issue simmered, state Democratic Party leaders, both black and white, cringed at the parry-and-thrust. Top party officials appealed to the Senator to resolve the issue and avoid any further political damage. ''Many people think that Reverend Jackson's political maneuverings leave a lot to be desired,'' said one senior Democratic official, who would only comment anonymously, to avoid being dragged into the dispute. ''But everyone in the black political leadership thinks that Torricelli's response was disrespectful. You don't talk to ministers like that.''</p>
        <p>The ministers responded to Mr. Torricelli's attack on their character by pulling together 30 of their members, who contended that they were present at the meeting last Oct. 8 when Mr. Torricelli is said to have  made the promise. Indeed, Mr. Torricelli is an independent-minded, free-speaking man who does not even have to worry about re-election until the year 2002. However, calling 30 ministers liars might be a bit much, even for him.</p>
        <p>Finally, early last week, a more reasoned approach prevailed, when the Senator and the executive committee of the ministers' group ended the three-week standoff and met in private in New Brunswick. At that time, Mr. Torricelli said he had no recollection of promising to fill one of his top jobs with a black person, and the ministers remained adamant in their position that he did, according to people who attended last week's  meeting. Although Mr. Torricelli's top three posts are already filled, he agreed to appoint a black staff member to serve as a close adviser and liaison to the ministers.</p>
        <p>''We told him we did not expect him to go bumping or shuffling any of his staff around,'' Mr. Jackson said. ''We thought that would not be fair to them for a mistake he made. We agreed to the liaison, but we still do not back off the fact that this was a commitment he made and he did not do it.''</p>
        <p>Whatever promises Mr. Torricelli may have made to the ministers before last November's election, his handling of the subsequent dispute was impaired by an apparent disregard for the important role these ministers play in their communities. ''Neither I nor my staff ever intended to impugn the integrity of the council or its members,'' Mr. Torricelli said in an apologetic statement issued after last week's meeting. Both sides pledged, the Senator said, to restore ''civility and mutual respect'' to their relationship.</p>
