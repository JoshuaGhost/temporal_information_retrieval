        <p>WHAT seemed almost certain just a week ago -- primaries for both the Democratic and Republican nominations for County Executive -- is now less so. Only two official candidates, one from each party, remain in the race: Andrew J. Spano, a Democrat, and Mayor Ted Dunn of Rye, a Republican.</p>
        <p>The first to announce her withdrawal from consideration last week was Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef, Democrat of Ossining, who said her husband, Steven, a former County Legislator, had been diagnosed with cancer of the vocal cords.</p>
        <p>''I can't do it all,'' Mrs. Galef said. ''Right now Steve is the most important thing.'' She added, ''His prognosis is very good.''</p>
        <p>The possibility of a Democratic primary remains, however. Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, who ran unsuccessfully for County Executive in 1989 and 1993, has said he is weighing a third bid, and other Democrats have also said they are considering running. If Mr. Brodsky were to challenge Mr. Spano for the nomination, it would be a rematch of the primary of 1993, when he defeated Mr. Spano. Also a possible candidate is Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci of New Rochelle, who said on Monday, ''I'm very, very much inclined to do this.''</p>
        <p>It is all but certain that there will not be a Republican primary, with the withdrawals of two of that party's candidates: Vincenza Restiano, President of the Yonkers City Council, and George Delaney of Briarcliff, a Consolidated Edison Company vice president. While both had repeatedly  vowed in the last few months that they would be in the race to the end, even if it meant a primary, they separately announced they were closing their campaigns in the face of political realities.</p>
        <p>''I withdrew in the interest of party unity,'' said Mr. Delaney, who was making his first bid for public office. ''In assessing the situation, I didn't see myself winning. I was probably trailing in third place.'' Mr. Delaney also announced that he would retire shortly from Consolidated Edison.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Restiano's bid for County Executive had received two key setbacks in the last month: the executive committee of the Westchester County Republican Committee had given its support to Mr. Dunn and the Westchester County Conservative Committee, fearing a split with the Republicans, declined to go along with the recommendation of its leader, Vincent Natrella, to endorse her.</p>
        <p>In a statement announcing her withdrawal from the race, she said, ''Although I believe I would have been the best candidate, leaders of the Republican Party have seen fit to move in a different direction.'' She said she would run for re-election as President of the Yonkers City Council.</p>
        <p>Her withdrawal clears the way for Mr. Dunn to receive the backing of the Conservative Committee. The Republican and Democratic Parties will have their nominating conventions in May to designate each party's official candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dunn, a retired managing director of the investment banking concern Morgan Stanley, first announced his candidacy two years ago, even before County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke had made a decision not to run for re-election. At the time, he was considered by political observers a long shot at best. In the interim, he has campaigned hard and spent his own money. Now as his campaign has become more viable, he has been successful in raising funds from other sources.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano, a resident of Yorktown, is the former County Clerk and until recently chairman of the Westchester Democratic Committee.</p>
