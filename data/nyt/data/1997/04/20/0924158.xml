      <abstract>
        <p>Letter by Lilco vice president Brian R McCaffrey charges that April 6 comment repeats false statements by Gregory Palast; quotes from Suffolk County, New York, court ruling on Palast's 'perverse' anti-Lilco bias (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>''Don't Hold Your Breath for Rebate'' $(Opinion, April 6$) contains false statements. Gregory Palast has testified against the Long Island Lighting Company in a number of proceedings, which are a matter of public record. His most recent testimony was in the Shoreham tax certiorari litigation in Suffolk County Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Given Mr. Palast's testimonial history, as set forth in the court's opinion in that case, we would have expected closer scrutiny before publication.</p>

        <p>''Don't Hold Your Breath for Rebate'' $(Opinion, April 6$) contains false statements. Gregory Palast has testified against the Long Island Lighting Company in a number of proceedings, which are a matter of public record. His most recent testimony was in the Shoreham tax certiorari litigation in Suffolk County Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Given Mr. Palast's testimonial history, as set forth in the court's opinion in that case, we would have expected closer scrutiny before publication.</p>
        <p>In the court's Nov. 4, 1996, opinion, it found:</p>
        <p>*''Mr. Palast's perverse and overriding anti-Lilco bias also caused him to testify to facts that were demonstrably false.</p>
        <p>*''Indeed, Mr. Palast's resume betrays his rampant anti-Lilco bias by continuing to refer to 'frauds committed by Lilco and certain of its officers' -- years after the Second Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed such claims, because the County of Suffolk was unable to prove any fraud.''</p>
        <p>*''In short, Mr. Palast has adopted a 'result-oriented approach' that assumes far more to his client's purpose than even the most favorable view of the evidence would permit.' This court rejects Mr. Palast's testimony in its entirety.''</p>
        <p>*''In summary, Mr. Palast's testimony to this court was disingenuous, evasive, biased and palpably false in numerous respects. Mr. Palast falsely stated facts that could not reasonable be disputed, and totally mischaracterized the Shoreham settlement.''</p>
