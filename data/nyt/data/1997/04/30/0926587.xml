        <p>The Knicks are out there, dangling like a pinata in front of a Miami Heat team that seems so ready to take a swipe at them.</p>
        <p>Maybe the Heat swung too soon tonight. If the Heat had taken the blindfold off, it would have seen the Orlando Magic riding a player who finally parted the dark cloud over his petulant image and acted like the superstar he has proclaimed himself to be: Anfernee Hardaway.</p>
        <p>Hardaway put the buzz over a second-round matchup between the Heat and the Knicks off for at least a couple of more days with an amazing 42-point effort, including 13 consecutively in a 23-3 second-quarter run, as the Magic won Game 3 by 88-75 at Orlando Arena.</p>
        <p>That miraculous run sucked up a 20-point Heat lead, an edge that had looked all too familiar in what had been a one-sided series.</p>
        <p>The Heat, which lead the series by 2-1, will face the Magic here on Thursday in Game 4.</p>
        <p>Magic first, then Knicks.</p>
        <p>''We read the statement where Tim Hardaway said the Heat had to focus on their next opponent, the Hornets or Knicks,'' Anfernee Hardaway said. ''Yeah, I think they were looking ahead.''</p>
        <p>The denials were everywhere.</p>
        <p>The Heat simply shrugged off the notion that it became complacent once it had built its 20-point lead in the opening minutes of the second quarter, refuting anyone who suggested it had thoughts of the Knicks dancing in their heads.</p>
        <p>''We didn't look past the Magic and we didn't look toward the Knicks,'' Tim Hardaway said. ''It was a case where we let it get away.''</p>
        <p>But how was that possible? The Heat has Coach Pat Riley, the ultimate motivator.</p>
        <p>Yet, he could not find the button to stop a Magic team that played Heat-like basketball. For instance, the Magic was getting the most out of its no-names -- like Darrell Armstrong (21 points), who came off the bench to cage Tim Hardaway (12 points). And the Magic got the absolute best effort from its defense, a Heat trademark. Such tenacious style forced the Heat into 22 turnovers, and pulled down the Miami shooting percentage from 50 in the first quarter to 36 by game's end.</p>
        <p>''The playoffs will humble you,'' said Riley, whose team had won Games 1 and 2 by an average of 26 points. ''Those games in Miami were aberrations. You come to find out that this game constantly brings you back to your knees.''</p>
        <p>Yet, there was not a feeling of being knocked down by the Heat. Here the Miami players had suffered a humiliating defeat.</p>
        <p>''I know I'm angry,'' Tim Hardaway of Miami said. ''We had this game.''</p>
        <p>And yet there was still an air of supreme confidence.</p>
        <p>''I know I'm not worried about anything,'' said Heat center Alonzo Mourning, referring to the series. ''I'm not worried at all.''</p>
        <p>There was cause for concern, though, especially when the Heat could not put the Magic out. It started out as if the Heat was going to pick up Game 3 and the series in a drive-through. Orlando quickly ordered up a 20-point lead. And just as the Magic was ready to peel off, Anfernee Hardaway twisted and turned along the baseline for 13 of his 26 first-half points during an unreal 23-3 Magic run that tied the score, 42-42, at the half.</p>
        <p>This is what happens when Mourning picks up a third foul with 6 minutes 49 seconds left in the half. He was a spectator for Anfernee Hardaway's inside moves through the Magic's outburst, a surge of energy that came with reserves like Danny Schayes on the floor. Schayes replaced an injured Rony Seikaly, who went down after a mid-foot sprain with 5:09 left in the first half.</p>
        <p>That did not deter the Magic, which seemed to have itself together for the first time in this series. Finally, it did not seem overwhelmed by the Heat. And whatever confidence it gained from its run did not shrink away when Mourning came back into the game in the second half. The Magic kept coming with its anonymous lineup, plus Anfernee Hardaway's heroics.</p>
        <p>''I knew if we were going to lose, it was going to be on my back,'' said the Orlando guard, who hit 16 of 30 shots. ''We didn't give up. I think we shocked them.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Magic center RONY SEIKALY, who went down with a foot sprain in the second quarter, said he will not be available for the rest of the playoffs. His injury could take two months to heal.</p>
