        <p>''Irma Vep'' was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 28. The film opens today at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, South Village.</p>
        <p>Olivier Assayas's sardonic ''Irma Vep'' is dimly about Louis Feuillade's silent film serial ''Vampires,'' featuring an actress named Musidora as a plumpish cat burglar scampering across Paris rooftops in skin-tight black. Inspired by this Irma Vep (whose name is an anagram for vampire), a fading New Wave auteur named Rene Vidal (Jean-Pierre Leaud) contrives an hommage.</p>
        <p>Vidal's own ''Irma Vep'' may emerge as a brilliant, revisionist version of this chestnut, but at the moment it's hard to tell. The main issues that seem to concern Rene are casting Maggie Cheung, the glamorously agile star of Hong Kong action movies, and squeezing her into the proper costume. An ''Irma Vep'' of the 90's will benefit greatly from the invention of form-fitting black latex.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cheung, playing herself, arrives in Paris looking understandably confused. She speaks neither French nor the universal cineaste's language that Mr. Assayas (a former editor of Cahiers du Cinema, and the director of more somber films including ''Cold Water'') incorporates into this droll, uneven satire.  ''Irma Vep'' offers opinions on topics ranging from the death of political cinema to the rise of John Woo, and it is best suited to audiences who take these matters seriously.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Assayas creates a flimsier ''Day for Night'' around the woes that beset the new ''Irma Vep,'' he introduces some highly amusing minor characters. Mr. Leaud is slyly good as the hypersensitive artiste who conspiratorially tells Ms. Cheung why she needs head-to-toe rubber (''It's like your mask for the world that makes you absolutely free'') and who has such dramatic fits of temper that at one point the fire department has to be called.</p>
        <p>Mr. Assayas also adds hangers-on who mutter about the decline of Rene Vidal's career, and a quick, barbed Godardian parody indicating exactly why Rene has fallen out of style. It doesn't help that Rene's latest inspiration comes from stills of Michelle Pfeiffer in Catwoman black.</p>
        <p>Nathalie Richard is especially memorable as Zoe, the wardrobe mistress who offers a running commentary on Vidal's tastes (''I say it's like hooker, but if he wants hooker, it's O.K.''). Zoe also holds forth on the creative bankruptcy of remaking old films, and her opinions have a sting. Also in ''Irma Vep,'' delivering satire that can be less than sharp, are a new auteur even more self-important than Vidal; Arsinee Khanjian in a notably gratuitous nude scene, and Bulle Ogier as a friend who plays a terse Cupid when Zoe admits to a crush on Ms. Cheung. ''She likes boys,'' Ms. Ogier explains to Ms. Cheung. ''She likes girls. She likes latex. She likes you.''</p>
