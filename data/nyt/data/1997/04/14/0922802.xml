        <p>Calling the violence wrought by guns a public health epidemic and identifying stricter gun control laws as the cure to its spread, the brother of a young musician who was shot and critically wounded atop the Empire State Building lashed out yesterday at politicians and lobbyists who stand in the way of such measures.</p>
        <p>''Could you imagine if there were actually a cure for AIDS or cancer or, at the time, polio, and there were people so motivated by politics that they were trying to prevent it?'' said Daniel Gross, the older brother of Matthew Gross, one of six people injured in the shootings on Feb. 23. A seventh, Chris Burmeister, a friend and bandmate of Matthew Gross, was killed.</p>

        <p>Calling the violence wrought by guns a public health epidemic and identifying stricter gun control laws as the cure to its spread, the brother of a young musician who was shot and critically wounded atop the Empire State Building lashed out yesterday at politicians and lobbyists who stand in the way of such measures.</p>
        <p>''Could you imagine if there were actually a cure for AIDS or cancer or, at the time, polio, and there were people so motivated by politics that they were trying to prevent it?'' said Daniel Gross, the older brother of Matthew Gross, one of six people injured in the shootings on Feb. 23. A seventh, Chris Burmeister, a friend and bandmate of Matthew Gross, was killed.</p>
        <p>''Our government is essentially doing nothing to prevent a deadly epidemic, even while they hold the cure in their hands,'' Daniel Gross told hundreds of people who gathered in a church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan for an annual remembrance of victims of crime. ''As an American, I find it embarrassing and sobering, and as a victim of the epidemic, I find it heartbreaking.''</p>
        <p>His impassioned speech, rendered in a voice of controlled rage and naked pain, was the centerpiece of a ritual now in its 12th year, a candlelight vigil that annually draws together New Yorkers who have been touched by violent crime. This one culminated as previous ones did, with a chilling recitation of the names of many of the dead.</p>
        <p>But before that spoken memorial came resolves, like that of Daniel Gross, to wrest good from evil, to transform laws and raise public awareness so that fewer New Yorkers, and fewer Americans, would come to know the grief shared by the husbands, wives, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters in the Church of St. Paul and St. Andrew yesterday.</p>
        <p>''Something has got to be done to stop the flow of guns into this city,'' said Morris Gurley, co-founder of the National Victim Center, a crime-victims advocacy and support group.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, also taking a turn at the lectern, echoed that appeal. He said that in many states, it was much easier to get a license for a gun than it was to get a license for a car, and that while both instruments have the power to kill, only one is designed for that purpose.</p>
        <p>Along with other speakers, Mr. Giuliani called for people to put pressure on lawmakers in other states and in Washington to restrict the number of guns and to monitor more strictly the backgrounds, temperaments and intentions of those who possess them.</p>
        <p>Daniel Gross, 30, homed in on the National Rifle Association and called the politicians who accept its support and do its bidding ''immoral.''</p>
        <p>''There is an element to the gun violence epidemic that is far more insidious than any medical epidemic,'' Mr. Gross an advertising executive, said. ''It may sound like a bad movie, but there are actually evil people working to spread the virus, including people in our government.</p>
        <p>''They generate a smokescreen of flawed and deceptive arguments to hide their true concern, which is not the physical health of the American people but the financial health of the gun and ammunition industry.''</p>
        <p>Before the vigil, Mr. Gross talked about his brother's arduous struggle to recover from the wound left by a bullet that passed straight through his head, injuring his brain.</p>
        <p>Matthew Gross, 27, of Montclair, N.J., is still in Bellevue Hospital Center, although his condition has improved steadily and he has begun to regain use of some of the faculties he lost in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. ''He is speaking, but not always coherently,'' Daniel Gross said. ''He walks, but not always steadily. Right now, the gap between him and a functioning person in society is heartbreaking.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Gross said the strides his brother has made over the last seven weeks were nonetheless remarkable, a testament to his brother's spirit. And there is hope that in coming weeks -- maybe, if all goes perfectly, by his brother's 28th birthday on April 23 -- he can leave Bellevue for a rehabilitation center.</p>
        <p>But no one can yet gauge what the extent of Matthew Gross's recovery may be. ''We're never going to have exactly the same person back,'' Daniel Gross said. ''It's the medical reality of what happens.''</p>
        <p>He said his brother has no memory of the shooting, but was told about it several weeks ago, when he finally seemed able to understand and absorb the news. Matthew Gross was also told that Mr. Burmeister, 27, who had been one of his closest friends, was dead.</p>
        <p>''There will be times,'' Daniel Gross said, ''when he's sitting there and he'll start crying and say, 'It's not fair, Chris, it's just not fair.' ''</p>
