        <p>At an international business conference here this morning, Prime Minister Li Peng dropped a piece of unusually good economic news: The nation's inflation rate fell to 3 percent in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Not even China's most optimistic economic forecasters had seen this coming. For now, China's leaders appear to have achieved what looked impossible not long ago: steadily high economic growth accompanied by ever-lower inflation.</p>
        <p>With the economy expanding by a jaunty 9.7 percent in the first quarter, many economists say it is remarkable that inflation could have fallen as far as 3 percent, down from 6 percent in the first quarter of 1996. They added that the figures, which reflect comparisons on a year-to-year basis, might have been skewed somewhat by short-term factors like an unusually strong harvest and overproduction of some goods.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Li painted a rosy economic picture, predicting that economic growth would continue steadily at an annual rate of 8 percent over the next three years and average 7 percent in the decade that follows.</p>
        <p>''The fulfillment of this goal will enable the country's overall national strength, and people's living standards, to reach a new high,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Economists said there were two main reasons for the decline in inflation. One is that the central Government has maintained the relatively tight monetary policy it started in 1993. But the more immediate reason seems to be that a bumper harvest in 1996 led to lower grain and other food prices, which are the main components of China's retail price index.</p>
        <p>''On the surface, it looks like good news,'' Nicholas Kwan, senior economist at Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong, said. ''But there are also elements that are abnormal or particular to this year's first quarter.''</p>
        <p>On top of the low grain prices, an oversupply of industrial and consumer goods led to lower prices in those areas, Mr. Kwan said. ''It's not because consumer demand is really that weak, but because producers are reaching capacity.''</p>
        <p>In a sophisticated market economy, Mr. Kwan pointed out, supply comes pretty close to consumer demand. But in China, still in the throes of a wrenching transition from its socialist past, many factories keep producing goods even when demand is falling. At the same time, there are shortages of other goods.</p>
        <p>So for all the good-looking numbers on economic growth and inflation, deep uncertainties persist in China's economy, which is weighed down by an immense and inefficient state-owned sector, chronic underemployment and widespread confusion about the future of the state's ideology. About half of China's state-owned industrial enterprises lose money, while most of the rest break even and only a few earn profits.</p>
        <p>However, the immediate outlook is brighter than it was in the summer of 1994, when inflation peaked at 24 percent and became a paramount concern of Chinese leaders, who feared that it might lead to unrest.</p>
        <p>Since an austerity program kicked in, inflation has dropped steadily, actually falling below the Government's target in 1996, when it leveled off at 6.1 percent. For 1997, the official forecast is that inflation will remain steady at 6.0 percent, though the first quarter's results could conceivably take it even lower.</p>
        <p>Deputy Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who has overseen the austerity program, may be able to use its success to bolster his position as a candidate to succeed Mr. Li as Prime Minister next year, when Mr. Li's second five-year term comes to an end. Deputy Prime Minister Li Lanqing, whose portfolio includes trade, is also a leading candidate.</p>
