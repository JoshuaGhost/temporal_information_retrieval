        <p>The Knicks' fortunes depend on the shooting accuracy of their starting backcourt.</p>
        <p>When they lost to a banged-up Orlando Magic team last Friday at Madison Square Garden, Allan Houston (2 for 6) and Chris Childs (0 for 6) combined for 8 points. The next night, during a come-from-behind victory over the Hawks in Atlanta, the two combined for 25.</p>
        <p>''We've been very inconsistent this season, but our backcourt hasn't been together as long as our frontcourt has been,'' Houston said. ''It's just a matter of time.''</p>
        <p>But the Knicks do not have time. With seven regular-season games remaining, New York (53-22) trails first-place Miami (57-18) by four games in the Atlantic Division. The Heat defeated the Detroit Pistons tonight, 94-88.</p>
        <p>And the Knicks have an arduous week ahead. They will play host to the Cleveland Cavaliers on Tuesday and the Chicago Bulls on Thursday, and visit the Heat for a Saturday matinee. The Cavaliers (38-37), who lost to Charlotte by 110-105 in overtime tonight, have their own problems. They are battling the Washington Bullets for the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff berth.</p>
