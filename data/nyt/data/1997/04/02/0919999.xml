        <p>The Informix Corporation said yesterday that it expected to report a loss for the first quarter due to a substantial shortfall in revenue during the period. The news sent Informix shares plummeting in heavy trading. Informix, the world's second-largest producer of data base software, attributed the shortfall to poor sales across all its markets. Informix shares closed at $9.875, down $5.25. Informix, based in Menlo Park, Calif., said that official results would be announced at the end of the month, but that first-quarter sales were expected to be $130 million to $145 million, compared with $204 million a year ago, and that the shortfall would result in a substantial operating loss and net loss. Analysts had expected the company to earn 12 cents a share.</p>
