        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As director of the New York City Mayor's Office of Operations, which operates the Scorecard program of street-cleanliness ratings, I was surprised to learn some of the details in your approach to surveying street cleanliness (''The Grime Factor,'' news article, April 15).</p>
        <p>You devoted three weeks to a survey that included serious problems in sampling and measurement techniques. Your sampling of 800 streets included no cross-checks to indicate whether they might be representative of the city as a whole; the Scorecard sample of 6,659 block faces has been shown to be representative within each of 230 sanitation sections.</p>
        <p>Your survey recorded one rating for the entirety of a street. Scorecard rates assign individual scale points to each two- to four-block segments. Your system would label as ''unacceptably dirty'' a 250-foot-long city block that was completely clean except for one small concentration of litter.</p>
        <p>The four-point scale you used was long ago found to be insufficient to rate New York City, which adopted a seven-point scale incorporating finer distinctions.</p>
        <p>Your assumption that Scorecard ratings are distorted by parked cars hiding litter is incorrect. Our raters drive far enough from the curb to see under the cars; they also sight along the curb line when turning the corner. If a curb line is not visible because of double parking, it receives no rating. There is no advantage, as you believe, in performing ratings on foot rather than in a slow-moving vehicle.</p>
        <p>Your article offered no convincing explanation of why three-quarters of your telephone poll respondents rated the streets ''somewhat'' or ''very'' clean, or of why each community board district manager you interviewed reported recent increases in street cleanliness. Do you believe that New Yorkers have suddenly become an uncritical group, disinclined to point out problems with government services? Everyone in the city with a clear view of our street conditions knows your survey was off the mark.</p>
