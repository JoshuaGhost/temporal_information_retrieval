        <p>WHO hasn't dreamed of going to a tropical island and never coming back? Or of replacing supermarket specials with fresh fruit and vegetables from your own garden and living off the sea and the land?</p>
        <p>Ian and Karin Goodfellow did more than dream.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, Mr. Goodfellow, then 33, was a commodities trader at the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto, and Karin Webb, then 23, was an assistant director of admissions at Nazareth College in Rochester. Sharing a passion for sailing and for each other, they were determined to escape their 9-to-whenever lives. So in 1993 they quit their jobs and sailed off on Mr. Goodfellow's 1929 wooden racing sloop, bound for Eleuthera, where his family had owned a house for more than 30 years.</p>
        <p>Today, the fantasy has become reality. Using his savings to buy 15 acres of his father's land, Mr. Goodfellow built a house and tennis court for his new wife -- they were married here in 1994 -- and last November, began turning the family garden into a small business.</p>
        <p>The garden once grew vegetables mainly to feed Mr. Goodfellow's father's rare tropical birds. During the growing season between October and June, the five-acre organic garden  produces a dazzling variety: four different varieties of lettuce, green beans, squash, corn, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, carrots, ginger, parsley and dozens of other herbs.</p>
        <p>But the Goodfellows could have taught Robinson Crusoe a thing or two. When Mr. Goodfellow is not diving for pleasure, or for fish for dinner (hogfish is one of the couple's favorites), he is chopping and sawing wood for the backgammon boards that his wife sands, lacquers, stencils in shell patterns, and paints for friends and has also begun to sell.</p>
        <p>From coconuts come hand-painted ornaments. From driftwood found on their beach and along the island's many inland lakes, they make and sell time and tide clocks, customized and painted with scenes of local flora and fauna. Then there are Mrs. Goodfellow's necklaces and earrings, which blend shells and coral found on the island's pink sand beaches with pieces of coconut, soapstone, glass, ceramics and brass.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Goodfellow's latest passion comes straight from the garden -- relishes and preserves made of the berries and fruit from the family's trees. Among her favorites is the carambola, an indigenous fruit that looks like an elongated yellow star and is often called star fruit in American specialty groceries.</p>
        <p>Last year, she began experimenting with carambola and other exotic fruit. Today, airtight jars line the shelves of an old wooden cupboard in her workshop: carambola and persimmon jellies, carambola-Surinam cherry jam, carambola relish, Grand Marnier marmalade, passion fruit-honey preserves, tomato-carambola chutney and zesty salsa -- all of which she now sells in three different sizes: four ounces ($4), half pints ($5) and pints ($8).</p>
        <p>Until the Goodfellows get work permits, all profits from the sale of their assorted food products and crafts are being donated to the Health Association of Central Eleuthera, where their labor helps support the island's ambulance fund.</p>
        <p>In trying to live off the land, Mr. Goodfellow is in some ways carrying on a family tradition. His father, Charles Goodfellow, was in the lumber business in Montreal in the late 1950's when he decided to flee the cold and become a Bahamian resident. By 1981, Town &amp; Country magazine described him as the island's ''renowned orchid grower, bird collector and bon vivant.''</p>
        <p>But the island today is no longer the chic enclave it was then. It has lost most of its British influence, including the Windemeer Island Club's tradition of tea and biscuits at 4 P.M. and cocktails at 6, followed by dining and dancing under the stars. So, the Goodfellows organized an informal tennis club at their farm.</p>
        <p>''We like the calm life,'' Mrs. Goodfellow said. ''It's one of the main reasons we came here.''</p>
        <p>But calm is not idle: Ian Goodfellow rises at 6 A.M. to pick up the three Haitians who help him tend his garden and fruit trees; his wife is in her workshop by 8. A steady stream of people come to collect orders on market days, Mondays and Thursdays between 9 and 11 A.M. In their spare time, the couple work on an addition to their house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodfellow says he misses only a few things from North America -- a good haircut, for instance. His wife misses the variety of shopping. But both say they have no regrets about their island adventure. ''When I think of my friends on Wall Street who leave their offices after 7 P.M. and drive back in pitch black to the suburbs in their leased BMW's to their heavily mortgaged homes, where they worry about how to pay for their kids' hefty private school tuition, I'm sure we made the right move,'' Mr. Goodfellow said. ''Choosing between that life and this one -- it's not even close.''</p>
        <p>Carambola Relish</p>
        <p>Total time: 3 days, about 30 minutes a day</p>
        <p>6 carambolas, to make 4 cups when chopped  7 ounces chopped pimento  1 cup cider vinegar  2 cups sugar</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt  1 1/2 tablespoons pickling spice</p>
        <p>1/8 teaspoon allspice  4 1-cup or 2 1-pint canning jars with lids and bands.</p>
        <p>Day 1: Wash the carambolas, removing the ends and dark ridges.  Using a food processor, coarsely chop them, then add the pimento. Continue chopping into small pieces or until the mixture reaches the desired texture. Transfer to a nonreactive container, add the vinegar, and cover. Let stand overnight.</p>
        <p>Day 2: Drain off the vinegar, and discard. In a medium saucepan over low heat, combine the carambola mixture, sugar, salt and spices. Simmer until it thickens, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, and allow to cool. Return to the covered container, and let stand overnight.</p>
        <p>Day 3: Sterilize the canning jars and lids by placing them in a large pot of simmering water. Remove the lids and bands once they are hot. Allow the jars to remain in the hot water until needed. In a medium saucepan, bring the relish to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pack into hot jars, and cap with bands and lids. Place the jars into the simmering water bath that had sterilized the empty jars. Simmer the packed jars for 15 minutes, remove, and allow to cool. Serve the relish over cream cheese with crackers, or with lamb, roast beef or ham.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 cups.</p>

        <p>Surinam Cherry And Carambola Jam</p>
        <p>Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>3 1-pint or 6 1-cup canning jars, with bands and lids  5 carambolas, to make 3 cups when chopped  1 cup pitted, chopped Surinam cherries (see note) or dried cranberries  6 cups sugar  1 cup liquid pectin.</p>
        <p>1. Wash the carambolas, removing the ends and dark ridges. Chop coarsely; you should have about 3 cups.</p>
        <p>2. Sterilize the canning jars and lids by placing them in a large pot of simmering water. Remove the lids and bands once they are hot. Allow the jars to remain in the hot water until needed.</p>
        <p>3. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the carambolas and cherries or cranberries. Chop until the carambola is in  3/4-inch pieces.</p>
        <p>4. In a large saucepan over low heat, stir the carambola mixture until it sizzles, then add the sugar. Allow the sugar to liquefy, then bring to a boil. Simmer, uncovered, for 15 minutes. Add the pectin, and simmer for another 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Pour the fruit mixture into hot, sterile jars. Cap with the bands and lids, and allow to cool.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 cups.</p>
        <p>Note: The Surinam cherry, also known as the Brazilian cherry or pitanga, grows widely in the tropics.  The cherries are about an inch in diameter, round or egg-shaped, varying in color from yellow to deep red.</p>

        <p>Carambola Muffins</p>
        <p>Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon butter at room temperature, plus butter for the muffin tins  1 cup brown sugar  1 large egg  1 cup flour</p>

        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Grease a muffin tin containing 12 2 1/2-inch cups.</p>
        <p>2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter and brown sugar. Mix well. With the mixer running, add the egg, flour, salt, boiling water, baking soda and vanilla, blending well after each addition.</p>
        <p>3. Wash the carambolas, removing the ends and dark ridges. Using a food processor, chop into  3/4-inch pieces.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the bowl from the mixer, and stir in the chopped carambolas. Fill each muffin cup two-thirds full. Bake for 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into a muffin comes out clean.</p>
