        <p>The Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station will be shut down for a few days to two weeks while repairs are made to control rods that failed to operate quickly enough during a regular weekend test, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The control rods are used to adjust the power level of the plant or to shut it down during routine or emergency situations. The rods, which are supposed to be inserted into the reactor core in less than half a second, fell short by a tenth of a second, said Suzanne D'Ambrosio, a spokeswoman for the generating station, which is owned by Jersey Central Power and Light Company.</p>
