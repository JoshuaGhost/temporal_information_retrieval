        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Internet Access Puts Burden of Control on Schools'' (news article, April 19):</p>
        <p>Most Internet filtering software represents an assault on intellectual freedom we can't afford. These packages not only often block potentially informative sites, as you report, but they also prevent the software installer, like the teacher or librarian, from viewing or editing the site and keyword lists used to determine what is blocked.</p>
        <p>However you feel about filtering the Internet, that is unacceptable.</p>
        <p>Internet filtering companies try to reassure us that they know what's best for us, but do we really want our choices handed over to commercial entities with unknown agendas?</p>
        <p>My own assessment of several of these packages, after a week of testing, is that they block sites a typical New Yorker would not object to. Filtering companies are quick to say that they have feedback mechanisms for reviewing sites, but if they really know what's good for us, why are these sites blocked in the first place?</p>
        <p>Guy V. Molinari, the Staten Island Borough President, is reportedly pressuring the New York Public Library system to use filtering software. Filtering, in some form or another, may be inevitable.</p>
        <p>However, we must insist on a bottom line: New York's schools and libraries must not use filtering tools that do not have viewable, editable site lists.</p>
        <p>Responsible adults have a right to this information, and information providers have a right to modify it quickly and without elaborate effort -- after all, we've traditionally made these decisions in other media, like books and videos.</p>
        <p>Don't turn teachers and librarians into mindless gatekeepers, and don't use the tax dollars of Jane and Joe New Yorker to take away their right to know what we're doing on their behalf.</p>
        <p>KAREN G. SCHNEIDER  Wayne, N.J., April 20, 1997</p>
        <p>The writer is a librarian.</p>
