        <p>Do celebrity appearances and special events at department stores fulfill any function other than the purely commercial? I never thought so -- until two autumns ago. One sunshiny September day, I was crossing 37th Street when I saw three militant Hummer vehicles barreling down Fifth Avenue. Upon noticing that each of the vehicles was bedecked with flags reading ''Hanes Resilience hosiery'' and with a bevy of preternaturally attractive women, I feared that fashion models had mobilized, with pantyhose as their broadswords. But a moment later reality set in. I realized that a promotional campaign had been loosed upon midtown like a virus and that I had become a most willing human host.</p>
        <p>The women alit from the Humm-V's. I followed them into Lord &amp; Taylor, where I learned that the supermodel, and Hanes spokesperson, Vendela was signing autographs. A jazz trio played; a crowd of hundreds had formed. I trudged through the noisome throng and got in line. A tall, nattily attired Lord &amp; Taylor employee told me that in order to aid the autographing process, I should write my name on the piece of paper she was handing me; she also gave me a raffle ticket, saying, ''Vendela's wearing a diamond necklace that we're raffling off.'' I asked, ''If I win, can I remove it from her neck?'' An eavesdropping shopper retorted, ''Yeah, with your teeth.''</p>

        <p>Do celebrity appearances and special events at department stores fulfill any function other than the purely commercial? I never thought so -- until two autumns ago. One sunshiny September day, I was crossing 37th Street when I saw three militant Hummer vehicles barreling down Fifth Avenue. Upon noticing that each of the vehicles was bedecked with flags reading ''Hanes Resilience hosiery'' and with a bevy of preternaturally attractive women, I feared that fashion models had mobilized, with pantyhose as their broadswords. But a moment later reality set in. I realized that a promotional campaign had been loosed upon midtown like a virus and that I had become a most willing human host.</p>
        <p>The women alit from the Humm-V's. I followed them into Lord &amp; Taylor, where I learned that the supermodel, and Hanes spokesperson, Vendela was signing autographs. A jazz trio played; a crowd of hundreds had formed. I trudged through the noisome throng and got in line. A tall, nattily attired Lord &amp; Taylor employee told me that in order to aid the autographing process, I should write my name on the piece of paper she was handing me; she also gave me a raffle ticket, saying, ''Vendela's wearing a diamond necklace that we're raffling off.'' I asked, ''If I win, can I remove it from her neck?'' An eavesdropping shopper retorted, ''Yeah, with your teeth.''</p>
        <p>I waited in line some 20 minutes. Vendela sat atop a pink carpeted platform in a sleeveless dress. She was signing Hanes posters -- color photographs of a nude-except-for-Hanes Vendela, the subtext of which seemed to be: ''She who dons resilience hosiery will be launched into a woozy dreamscape of postcoital languor.'' When I finally reached the platform, Vendela looked slightly askance at my slip of paper: I had written Hanque on it. ''It's French for Hank,'' I told her. ''I'm hoping people will think I'm more attractive if I have a one-word name.'' I watched her try to grapple with this concept. ''Is it working for you?'' I asked. She smiled at me somewhat uncertainly and then delivered her bombshell: ''I think you're attractive no matter what your name is.'' I remarked, ''Wow.'' She signed my poster: ''To Hanque! Love and kisses, Vendela.'' Flattery having apparently jellified my powers of articulation, I reiterated, ''Wow!''</p>
        <p>I gloated for weeks; my internal emotional dial was decidedly set on Auto-Kvell. I have attended seven other celebrity appearances at department stores since; it's like going to Elaine's, but without all the garlic. Although I have yet to achieve the level of approbation that I did at Lord &amp; Taylor, I have often been warmed by the frictional glow of the rich and famous rubbing up against hoi polloi. I have seen Liz Taylor, promoting her Black Pearls fragrance at Macy's, fend off questions about her ''food problem.'' (''And what did you have for dinner last night?'' one customer demanded.) I have witnessed the spectacle of Eric Ripert (air-EEK repair), chef and owner of Le Bernardin, lugging an Igloo cooler stuffed with tuna tartare through the gauntlet of Macy's cosmetics department. I possess a photograph of rapper LL Cool J from his appearance at Bloomingdale's, autographed and personally inscribed to me with the message, ''Be Cool.'' Granted, small things. And yet, something.</p>
        <p>I have also made two acquaintances with whom I may re-establish contact. I attended Macy's celebration of World History Month, which featured three African drummers, surrounded by cookware displays and asparagus forks in Macy's Cellar, pounding explosively on their drums in honor of a children's book that describes the blighted yam harvest of the Yoruba tribe in 1440. I said to one of the drummers, ''This is going to look very interesting on your resume.'' He laughed and gave me his business card.</p>
        <p>Three days later, a sign at the Share Our Strength benefit brunch at Bloomingdale's encouraged me to tuck into some ''very special cheesecake'' prepared by Joey Reynolds, the W0R-AM radio personality. I did. It was sublime. ''I make a very special cheesecake. too,'' I told Joey, who reminds me of Joe Pesci trapped in the body of Tony Randall. ''But it's not this special.'' Joey revealed to me: ''My secret is I use a lot of nothing. Other people add lemon, rum, lime. I've cut it down to the basics. Less is more.'' (At the end of the brunch, I found Joey at the coat check, where he asked me, somewhat neurotically, ''So -- so you liked the cheesecake?'')</p>
        <p>But pressed to single out the VIP whose intrastore appearance has provided me with the most sustenance, I would have to name Larry Harmon, the original Bozo the Clown, whom I saw at Bloomingdale's. Dressed in a double-breasted suit and boots with two-inch heels, his gray hair copiously trained over his pate, this charming 71-year-old confided to me that Golda Meir once called him and opined that if Bozo had been around 3,000 years ago, ''the Arabs and Israelis would never have fought.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, when I'm feeling irritable or depressed or overwhelmed by my lot in life, I form a mental image of Bozo, squirting seltzer down the Maccabees' pants in the pre-Christian Levant. It's enough to keep me going.</p>
