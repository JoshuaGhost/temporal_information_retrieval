        <p>Two large American beverage marketers have assigned two of their longtime agencies additional product accounts.</p>
        <p>The Coors Brewing Company of Golden, Colo., and Lion Nathan of New Zealand said that Tatham Euro RSCG of Chicago had been named to handle advertising in the United States for Lion Nathan's Castlemaine XXXX, a popular Australian beer. Coors and Lion Nathan recently formed a joint venture to import the beer to the United States. Tatham, which already handles Coors brands like Coors's Cutter nonalcoholic brew, was awarded the assignment without a review. Billings have not yet been determined.</p>
        <p>Monica Selent, a Tatham spokeswoman, said the agency was considering a variety of creative approaches for the brand's American introduction, scheduled for Sept. 13. In Australia and Britain, Castlemaine XXXX campaigns are known for their humorous bent.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies of Dallas said that it had named Young &amp; Rubicam New York to handle advertising for the test of a proposed line of beverages called Welch's Sparkling Water Refreshers. The product, which is being tested in five markets, comes in three flavors: raspberry, cherry and cranberry. (What, no grape?) The campaign carries the theme "They don't just sparkle, they burst."</p>
        <p>Y.&amp; R. New York, which handles other company brands, like Dr Pepper, was awarded the account without a review. Billings were not disclosed.</p>
