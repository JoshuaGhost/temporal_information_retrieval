        <p>I am delighted to report that your recent article recounting the search for accommodation in New York by my wife, Pat, and myself has had a most positive outcome  [ "Apartment-Hunting in New York With Michael and Pat York," April 15 ] . It also revealed to us some salient qualities that the citizens of this wonderful town seem to share in abundance.</p>
        <p>Not only do large numbers read your newspaper but also, despite what others may think, New Yorkers are a caring and generous people. Everyone, it seemed, had just the place for us, or knew of someone who did.</p>

        <p>To the Home Section:</p>
        <p>I am delighted to report that your recent article recounting the search for accommodation in New York by my wife, Pat, and myself has had a most positive outcome  [ "Apartment-Hunting in New York With Michael and Pat York," April 15 ] . It also revealed to us some salient qualities that the citizens of this wonderful town seem to share in abundance.</p>
        <p>Not only do large numbers read your newspaper but also, despite what others may think, New Yorkers are a caring and generous people. Everyone, it seemed, had just the place for us, or knew of someone who did.</p>
        <p>Even before we had had a chance to read the article that morning, a neighbor had discreetly slipped us a note about an available apartment. Such kindness of strangers has continued to follow us. A chance encounter -- of a positive nature -- in Central Park is responsible for our recent move to a truly extraordinary residence. All of this makes even more resonant the title of the play in which I am currently engaged, "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me"!</p>
        <p>May I, through the courtesy of your columns, as they say from where I come from, thank most sincerely everyone involved. With this priority now behind us, we would welcome being stopped again -- this time perhaps to discuss how best to get holistic therapies on Hillary Clinton's health agenda.
