        <p>It was the idea of European union, rather than the specifics of the Maastricht treaty, that Danish voters finally said "yes" to on Tuesday. The ambitious Maastricht blueprint for a unified European foreign and defense policy and a single European currency seems increasingly unlikely to be realized, at least by the 1999 deadline.</p>
        <p>Americans have little stake in the details of Maastricht, but a great deal in closer European cooperation. The events of the past year, from currency upheavals to Europe's disastrous fumbling of the Bosnia catastrophe, painfully underscore how far Europe still has to go.</p>
        <p>The Maastricht treaty, drawn up at a meeting of European heads of government in December 1991, never attracted much popular enthusiasm. The treaty failed its first referendum test in Denmark and barely survived a referendum in France. Maastricht remains a hard-fought issue in Britain, where Parliament is to vote on approval today. And in Germany, ratification faces legal challenges.</p>
        <p>European leaders made a serious mistake when they refused to develop democratic institutions to carry out the European Community's expanded role. That left real power with national governments that often failed to agree on common approaches. And it increased resentment of the Community's unpopular Brussels bureaucrats.</p>
        <p>Maastricht's other great flaw was its failure to embrace the newly liberated countries of Eastern Europe. A more expansively defined Europe would probably have been less myopic about Bosnia and less protectionist toward countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
        <p>The smoothest way to move forward now would be to complete the ratification process in Britain and Germany, then proceed to radical revisions.</p>
        <p>Community protectionism and the reluctance of West European governments to take responsibility for the Continent's security are the two most serious problems now afflicting the American-European relationship. A geographically expanded and democratized Community would offer hope of a less parochial, more enlightened Europe.</p>
