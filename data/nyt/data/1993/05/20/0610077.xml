        <p>Abortion-rights supporters won an important victory today as a bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee approved legislation that would ban most state restrictions on abortion.</p>
        <p>Committee liberals bit their tongues and voted for two amendments intended to improve the bill's chances on the House floor. One would leave intact state laws requiring parental consent or notification before a minor could have an abortion. The other would allow states to exempt private institutions, like Catholic hospitals, from performing abortions.</p>
        <p>Those provisions, opposed by many abortion-rights advocates, including some panel members who voted for them today, were considered essential if the bill was to have any hope of winning a majority on the House floor. But even with them, passage is uncertain, and a lengthy period of lobbying and vote counting is expected before any vote is scheduled.</p>
        <p>The vote to send the bill to the full House for action was 20 to 15. Only two Democrats, Romano L. Mazzoli of Kentucky and George E. Sangmeister of Illinois, voted against the bill and only one Republican, Jim Ramstad of Minnesota, voted for it. Troubles Ahead</p>
        <p>But votes preceding that were even more revealing about the difficulties ahead for what the bill's sponsors call the Freedom of Choice Act. An important purpose of the bill is to invalidate the sort of state waiting periods that the Supreme Court upheld in 1992. An effort to amend the bill to allow such waiting periods failed on a tie vote.</p>
        <p>The count was 17 to 17, with Representative Dan Glickman, Democrat of Kansas, absent for that vote. Mr. Glickman said he did not know how he would have voted on the specific amendment, but he said he did not want to eliminate his state's waiting period. Supporters of the bill fear that they will have a tough time defeating such an amendment on the floor.</p>
        <p>The Judiciary Committee is one of the most ideological in the House, with particularly liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans. It has only one woman, Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado. The 48 women in the 435-member House are more heavily represented on every other standing panel except the unimportant District of Columbia Committee, which also has only one woman.</p>
        <p>Abortion is also one of the less partisan issues in Congress. The votes today were an uncertain beacon for the floor, where there are other committed anti-abortion Democrats like Mr. Mazzoli and Mr. Sangmeister and other Republican backers of abortion rights like Mr. Ramstad. Predictions by Lobbyists</p>
        <p>Kate Michelman, head of the National Abortion Rights Action League, said after the vote that she expected "much more Republican support on the floor." Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life, said, "We'll get a lot more Democratic support on the floor."</p>
        <p>The timetable in the Senate is equally uncertain, though a similar bill came out of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in late March.</p>
        <p>Much of today's debate was spent on whether the bill merely codified Roe v. Wade, the 1973 abortion decision, as its supporters contended, or went far beyond it. Its chief opponent, Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, suggested that the bill would force states to pay for abortions.</p>
        <p>Representative Don Edwards, Democrat of California, said the bill was written to endorse abortion law as it stood before 1989, when the Supreme Court gave the states new latitude to impose restrictions on abortion. And the committee chairman, Representative Jack Brooks of Texas, said it was needed to protect women against the effects of the Supreme Court's retreat from the Roe decision.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hyde compared the bill with the right-to-die mission of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, saying that "Kevorkian only kills people who want to die," while this bill killed those who had no choice. Parental Consent</p>
        <p>Mr. Hyde contended that the provision allowing laws that require parental consent or notification but that also provide a way for a minor to bypass that procedure did not go far enough. He said that as drafted, it would not protect all such state laws.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hyde supported the provision allowing private hospitals to refuse to perform abortions after failing to include public hospitals.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Schroeder voted against that proposal after complaining about "all these politicians wrapping all their rhetoric around my reproductive system." But it carried, 31 to 4.</p>
        <p>Another Republican effort to allow states more latitude was defeated 20 to 15 after harsh debate. Representative Bill McCollum of Florida argued for allowing states to impose "informed consent laws." Patients would have to be counseled about medical risks and about adoption and other alternatives to abortion. He said the public favored such laws, which the Supreme Court upheld last year.</p>
        <p>Representative Schroeder said that it treated women as "lesser creatures" and that doctors already warned women of medical risks.</p>
        <p>But Representative Bob Inglis, Republican of South Carolina, said abortion providers "want to make a lot of money out of this." He said: "They are not doctors. They may have graduated from some medical school at the bottom of their class, from some back alley."</p>
