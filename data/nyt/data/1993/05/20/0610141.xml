        <p>'1924 Now'  Manhattan School of Music</p>
        <p>It was a very good year. Janacek's "Cunning Little Vixen," Strauss's "Intermezzo," Schoenberg's "Erwartung," Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," Sibelius's Symphony No. 7 and Respighi's "Pines of Rome" all had their premieres in 1924. So did a number of humbler creations that were performed in whole or in part on Wednesday evening by students of David Noon's class on music and life in 1924, including Varese's "Octandre," Prokofiev's Piano Sonata No. 5, Stravinsky's Sonata and Poulenc's "Poemes de Ronsard."</p>

        <p>The focus on a given year makes a tenuous theme for a concert, and the frequent presentation of excerpts -- an isolated movement or two, sometimes in inverse order -- was disconcerting. But the juxtapositions added up to a fascinating cross-section of a time of ferment, with swirling stylistic strains shot through by idiosyncrasy.</p>
        <p>Several performances were excellent. Carol To, a soprano, showed flair and sensitivity in Bartok's "Village Scenes." Another soprano, Elisabeth Weigle, sang excerpts from Hindemith's "Marienleben" with intensity, and was well accompanied on piano by S. G. Otto. Dan Bar Hava proved an inventive jazz pianist in ensemble arrangements of Youmans's "Tea for Two" and two Gershwin songs.</p>
