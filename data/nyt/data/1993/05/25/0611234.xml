        <p>Charles Oakley isn't big on sympathy. So asked whether Horace Grant looked bothered by his sore right ankle in Game 1, Oakley had this response:</p>
        <p>"This is my rule -- if you're playing, you're not hurt. As far as all that other, if your ankle, toe, or back hurts, stay at home."</p>

        <p>Charles Oakley isn't big on sympathy. So asked whether Horace Grant looked bothered by his sore right ankle in Game 1, Oakley had this response:</p>
        <p>"This is my rule -- if you're playing, you're not hurt. As far as all that other, if your ankle, toe, or back hurts, stay at home."</p>
        <p>Oakley's 14 rebounds on Sunday were instrumental in the Knicks' 48-28 rebounding edge over Chicago. Oakley, Patrick Ewing, Charles Smith, and Anthony Mason dominated inside play, holding the Bulls to one shot and turning them into jump shooters.</p>
        <p>Grant, the Bulls' power forward, said his team was simply outmuscled.</p>
        <p>"Look at Oakley's body, look at Patrick's body, and look at Mason's body, then look at my body and Bill Cartwright's body," Grant said. "That answers your question right there. Those guys are huge. We've got to be more assertive, do a better job of going after the ball."</p>
        <p>The Knicks were the league's top rebounding team during the regular season, so Sunday was not an accident. But doing a better job on the boards will be a top priority for the Bulls in Game 2.</p>
        <p>"They overran us, even stripped the ball out of our hands after we had it," said Bulls Coach Phil Jackson. "We can't allow that." War of the Words</p>
        <p>Knicks Coach Pat Riley refused to be drawn further into a war of words with Jackson. Riley said Sunday he believed that some of Jackson's past comments about the Knicks had been personal, crossing the line of gamesmanship. But asked to elaborate on that yesterday, Riley said: "That's for you to decide. That isn't for you to be a special-delivery carrier of his messeges to me, then get a comment from me. I think when somebody begins to make personal attacks on people, then that's for you to decide whether it's valid. I don't give a damn."</p>
        <p>Clearly, Riley and Jackson will not be having dinner during the series. Asked about their rivalry today, Jackson said: "We should be rivals. That's what it's all about. Both of us are trying to get our teams ready, trying to get the upper hand." Tending to Pressing Matters</p>
        <p>The Knicks spent most of today's practice working on attacking Chicago's full-court press, which New York expects to see more of in Game 2. The Knicks committed 23 turnovers in Game 1, and they were fortunate that those miscues did not hurt them more often.</p>
        <p>"If someone had asked me, would we win turning the ball over that much, I would've said no," Riley said. "Some of the turnovers we had early were ridiculous. We're going to have to do a better job in that area. Guys are open, but there were times when we were afraid to pull the trigger. We're going to have to be more aggressive, especially our guards when they're dribbling." Blackman's Back Feels Better</p>
        <p>After seeing a new therapist for the last month, Rolando Blackman said the ruptured disk in his back feels better. But Blackman may still have to have surgery when the season ends. "Everything's on hold now, but at least I've been able to move better, play roughhouse with my kids around the house," Blackman said. "I just want to continue doing whatever I can when I'm out there to help us win."</p>
        <p>After making his first two shots in Game 1, Blackman only got two more attempts the rest of the game. Asked whether he felt he should have gotten more shots, Blackman said, "The first two felt good, and after that, I have no comment."  KNICKS NOTEBOOK: PRO BASKETBALL</p>
