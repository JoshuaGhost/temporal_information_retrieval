        <p>A Larry Gatlin fan club composed entirely of celebrities materialized at the annual Manhattan Theater Club gala on Monday. Lynn Redgrave, a host, was the first to proclaim her lust for Mr. Gatlin (below right), the current star of "The Will Rogers Follies."</p>

        <p>A Larry Gatlin fan club composed entirely of celebrities materialized at the annual Manhattan Theater Club gala on Monday. Lynn Redgrave, a host, was the first to proclaim her lust for Mr. Gatlin (below right), the current star of "The Will Rogers Follies."</p>
        <p>"I'm not taking hormones, I've had no plastic surgery, and I want Larry Gatlin," she said. Later, Stephen Collins, a star of the Manhattan Theater Club's play "Putting It Together," said in jest: "I have a confession to make. I want Larry Gatlin. There goes the career in the military."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gatlin said, "My God, it is New York. But without casting aspersions on anyone, I'll take Lynn Redgrave." He added that he'd been feeling overshadowed by Marla Maples, whose final performance in "Follies" was last Sunday. "She has done a very fine job," he said, "but there is going to be life after Marla."</p>
        <p>At the opening of "Angels in America" on Tuesday, Ron Leibman, who portrays a particularly villainous Roy Cohn in the play, said that people who knew the lawyer find his performance eerie: "The Shuberts knew him and did business with him, and they said, 'It's very scary what you're doing.'
