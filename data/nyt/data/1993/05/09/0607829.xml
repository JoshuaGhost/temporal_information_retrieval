        <p>MILDRED AUGUSTINE WIRT BENSON had just arrived in Chicago from Toledo, carrying a red leather pocketbook and wearing a crinkly plastic rain bonnet. The writer of 23 of the first 30 original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories had missed her connecting flight to Iowa, where she would be guest of honor at the first-ever Nancy Drew Conference.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Benson -- who is 87 but does not like to discuss her age because she is still a working professional -- was lugging a sack of Nancy Drew books through O'Hare Airport's endless corridors and carrying a copy of the day's edition of The Toledo Blade, where she writes a weekly column called "On the Go with Millie Benson." On the front page was the headline: "Her Novels a Treasure: University of Iowa Honors Benson, Nancy Drew Author."</p>

        <p>MILDRED AUGUSTINE WIRT BENSON had just arrived in Chicago from Toledo, carrying a red leather pocketbook and wearing a crinkly plastic rain bonnet. The writer of 23 of the first 30 original Nancy Drew Mystery Stories had missed her connecting flight to Iowa, where she would be guest of honor at the first-ever Nancy Drew Conference.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Benson -- who is 87 but does not like to discuss her age because she is still a working professional -- was lugging a sack of Nancy Drew books through O'Hare Airport's endless corridors and carrying a copy of the day's edition of The Toledo Blade, where she writes a weekly column called "On the Go with Millie Benson." On the front page was the headline: "Her Novels a Treasure: University of Iowa Honors Benson, Nancy Drew Author."</p>
        <p>She turned wearily to a companion. "I'm so sick of Nancy Drew I could vomit," she said.</p>
        <p>The 5-foot-zero, 110-pound author, aviatrix and newspaper columnist was dressed in a turquoise pants suit, which, she thought, after a protracted day of traveling, made her look "like an Iowa frump." As if that weren't enough, now she was stranded at O'Hare for five hours with a colleague 49 years her junior who spent her childhood addicted to Nancy Drew.</p>
        <p>Like Nancy Drew in "The Bungalow Mystery," who was left to starve in a dank cellar, Mrs. Benson assessed the situation and knew her escape routes were limited.</p>
        <p>"What kind of lead are you going to put on this horsey thing?" she said, suspiciously eyeing the reporter's notebook while she was sitting at an airport restaurant eating a turkey sandwich and french fries.</p>
        <p>Until recently, Mrs. Benson's role as the original Carolyn Keene, a nom de plume beloved by generations of readers, was not widely known, a mystery that might be called "The Secret of the Sacred Pseudonym." Her anonymity basically suited her just fine.  "I've kept it in the dark, especially locally," she explained. "I didn't want to be pestered."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Benson's plucky 16-year-old girl detective -- who drove a blue roadster, veering onto creepy detours just at the moment the sky turned ominous -- was conceived by Edward Stratemeyer, founder of the Stratemeyer Syndicate, who hired ghostwriters to write the Nancy Drew mysteries. The Syndicate also produced "The Bobbsey Twins," "The Hardy Boys" and dozens of other juvenile series books. But it was Mrs. Benson who wrote the first one, "The Secret of the Old Clock," published in 1930, and who gave the blonde bobbed sleuth her gumption.  An Uncommon Woman</p>
        <p>"I sort of liked the character from the beginning," she said. "Now that kind of woman is common, but then it was a new concept, though not to me. I just naturally thought that girls could do the things boys did. "</p>
        <p>Nancy Drew (she is rarely called Nancy) has served as a role model for generations, passed on from mother to daughter. She is now being viewed as a witty, independent heroine. Nancy Drew was always smarter than the grown-ups, with the possible exception of her father, Carson Drew, a prominent lawyer. Her family set-up alone was the stuff of girls' dreams. Carson Drew was always proud of his daughter's capacity to solve mysteries. (More important, he was a widower, so that his precocious daughter never had to compete for his affections.)</p>
        <p>Among Nancy Drew's "chums" were Bess Marvin (the fraidy-cat) and her cousin George Fayne (the tomboy). Predictably perhaps, the chums were the subject of a talk at the conference called "Lesbian Code in Nancy Drew Mystery Stories."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Benson fleetingly dropped her polite demeanor when informed of this theory. "This is the silliest, most out-of-the-picture thing I've ever heard! I'd like to blow a cork!" she said.</p>
        <p>As the author of 120 to 130 juvenile series books (she can't remember exactly), Mrs. Benson was not only Carolyn Keene but also Frank Bell and Ann Wirt, to name two. Among her creations were the "Ruth Darrow Flying Stories" -- after Ruth Elder, a pilot.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Benson's life -- she still flies airplanes -- has tended to resemble her heroine's. A doctor's daughter, she was born in Ladora, Iowa, and had an active girlhood. She was an avid swimmer; a jewel of the Mildred Benson collection at the Iowa Women's Archives is a photo of young Millie doing a swan dive into the Iowa River.</p>
        <p>In the 1930's, literary role models for young women were paltry, at best. But Mrs. Benson insists she didn't model Nancy Drew on her own experience: "I didn't consciously make her like myself. I made her good-looking, smart and a perfectionist. I made her a concept of the girl I'd like to be."</p>
        <p>But Nancy wasn't her only icon. In "The Ghost of Ladora," a 1973 essay, she writes of Nancy Drew: "I did feel as if I were she, but then when I created the Dot and Dash stories for younger children, I likewise felt as if I were Dot's obnoxious dog, Dash."</p>
        <p>She was the first woman to get a master's degree in journalism from the University of Iowa. Mrs. Benson has been married and widowed twice. She wrote some of the earliest Nancy Drews on her old Underwood typewriter by her first husband's bedside. One year she wrote 13 books -- while working as a reporter. Intriguing History</p>
        <p>Mrs. Benson got paid $125 -- plus Christmas bonuses -- for writing each Nancy Drew book and, like most ghostwriters, signed a release denying any claim on the character. "You couldn't get any work in those days unless you signed a release," she said. "It never bothered me." The only thing that did, she said, "was a period when doubt was expressed that I'd written them."</p>
        <p>The books' complex publishing history has been a source of intrigue. Starting in 1959, many of the books were rewritten and updated by Harriet Stratemeyer Adams, a daughter of Edward Stratemeyer. Mrs. Adams has erroneously been credited as the original Carolyn Keene. According to Deidre Johnson, a professor at West Chester University in Pennsylvania, Mrs. Benson "put flesh on the character," but Mrs. Stratemeyer kept the series alive throughout the 1960's until her death in 1982.</p>
        <p>In recent years, a number of book collectors and would-be sleuths, chiefly Geoffrey S. Lapin, a cellist for the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, unraveled the identity of Nancy Drew's original author, who was honored publicly at the conference for the first time.</p>
        <p>When not writing "On the Go With Millie Benson," a peppery mix of personal observations combined with profiles of 70-something bat girls and others, Mrs. Benson is on the go -- regularly exercising at the gym and playing golf. Her golf average is "a secret greater than 'The Secret of the Old Clock.' " She glanced at her fellow journalist. "I just gave you a good quote, didn't I?"</p>
        <p>She still loves to fly, although she no longer does loops and recently sold her Cherokee 180. "Some of my greatest adventures have been up in the sky," she said, recalling a near-miss at the edge of a tornado. She has also made nine solo trips to Central America to study Pre-Columbian archaeology.</p>
        <p>To the woman who has written more than 120 tales, today's plot was obvious. "I'd tie this into being stranded here," she said, "if you want some advice from an old hack."</p>
