        <p>A PLACE OF GREATER SAFETY</p>
        <p>By Hilary Mantel. 749 pp. New York: Atheneum. $25.</p>
        <p>THE French Revolution, that swirl of events, passions and tragedies, struck even its participants as highly improbable: no one could have guessed that Louis XVI, highly popular as late as the summer of 1790, would, two and a half years later, lose his life on the guillotine. Even when his execution had actually taken place, it still seemed almost more like fiction than fact.</p>
        <p>For France, and then for the rest of Europe, the world changed utterly in the years that followed 1789: new regimes, new laws, a new organization of the way property was held, a new system of education -- all these transformed the way people lived their lives. Great families, very lately at the peak of their splendor, struggled to survive; newcomers rose dramatically, from workman to marshal of France or, in the most celebrated case, from impoverished lieutenant to emperor.</p>
        <p>All this made for reams of copy -- first, and most austerely, in the shape of the decrees of the National Assembly and in the pages of official newspapers. Soon, though, the facts began to be presented in a more inviting way. By the 1820's the publication of memoirs had turned into a major industry, and almost everyone, from Lafayette to Napoleon himself, had his own version of events ready for all to read.</p>
        <p>Most of these memoirs were, in fact, partly fictional. The next step was for the Revolution to provide novelists with a dramatic backdrop: Alexandre Dumas took care of that in a series of volumes, starting with "Joseph Balsamo"; but while real and famous people appear in his pages, it is only fleetingly and at a distance. The same was true, a little later, when Dickens wrote "A Tale of Two Cities."</p>
        <p>It's understandable, then, that a late-20th-century novelist, Hilary Mantel, working at a much greater remove, should turn the tables and make the principal figures of the Revolution the main characters in her new novel, "A Place of Greater Safety." As for history itself, it has been assigned an ambiguous role: the main events are real; snatches of dialogue and letters come from authentic sources; as for the rest, Ms. Mantel writes airily in an author's note, "anything that seems particularly unlikely is probably true." That, together with her sneer at "the complaints of pedants," leaves her readers in a curiously uncertain position: are we reading history amplified by the empathy of the novelist or fiction dressed up in historical costume?</p>
        <p>Ms. Mantel, who has published four previous novels in her native Britain, is a gifted writer, so this is a hard question to answer. As a work of fiction, "A Place of Greater Safety" is unquestionably a success. Ms. Mantel understands how people feel, how they react, how they think. She has the kind of long view that enables her convincingly to take up a character in childhood and bring him or her to dramatic adulthood. Just as important, she knows how to make us sympathize. To meet Danton as the unruliest of boys, then as a happily married young lawyer, helps us to comprehend his emotions as he progresses to the revolutionary leadership he eventually assumes. And it is not only Danton we meet; Ms. Mantel's cast of characters is wide and varied, from a conventional civil servant to Robespierre and his acid sister, Charlotte, from Choderlos de Laclos, the author of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses," to the naive and enthusiastic Lucile, wife of Camille Desmoulins.</p>
        <p>In presenting these characters to the reader, Ms. Mantel weaves in and out of the first-person singular: sometimes we are hearing their thoughts, and sometimes we are dispassionately watching them from the outside; sometimes they speak to us directly. Here, too, we are in good hands, since these shifts of perspective add an aura of reality to the interior monologues, of truth to the exterior descriptions. And, of course, Ms. Mantel makes ample use of the period's climactic events: we pass from the inebriating hopes of the early Revolution to the undiluted tragedy of the Terror, and everything we have learned about the characters helps us to understand how this has happened.</p>
        <p>Still, there is much in Ms. Mantel's very long novel that also feels forced. It is not so easy, after all, for a 20th-century author to become an 18th-century revolutionary, and on occasion she writes dialogue that reads like a parody of a historical novel:</p>
        <p>"Robespierre was ill. The raw spring weather hurt his chest, and his stomach rejected what he fed it.</p>
        <p>" 'So you desert your friends,' he said, wheezing a little.</p>
        <p>" 'This need not affect our friendship,' Camille said grandly.</p>
        <p>"Robespierre looked away.</p>
        <p>" 'You remind me -- what's the name of that English King?'</p>
        <p>" 'George,' Robespierre snapped.</p>
        <p>" 'I think I mean Canute.' "</p>
        <p>This, in the end, is the weakness of "A Place of Greater Safety," and because of it the tension between history and fiction is never resolved, not infrequently leaving the reader stranded. It is easy to see why the Revolution proved such a temptation for Ms. Mantel. To make its earthshaking developments come alive through their participants is a noble ambition, but in the end we are left to wonder whether more novel and less history might not better suit this author's unmistakable talent.</p>
