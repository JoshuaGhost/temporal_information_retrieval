        <p>The sawtooth-edge-stripe skirt from Karl Lagerfeld is fashion's spring success. The novelty print, in a synthetic stretch fabric, seems to be the introduction many women need to experiment with a longer skirt that can be dressed up for evening with a blazer piped in white or worn in the daytime with a variety of tailored jackets. The slim skirt, in black or navy on white, is always worn long, as it was shown in Paris, and always with black stockings, shoes or ankle boots -- just as the designer presented it in October. One woman even adopted the lace-up white boots, as Mr. Lagerfeld showed them. The distinctive pattern is a relief to the monotone of the familiar matching suit. It is also the uptown woman's alternative to the downtown crowd's boldly striped pants.</p>
