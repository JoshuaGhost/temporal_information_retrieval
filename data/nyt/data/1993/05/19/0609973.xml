        <p>Bertolli Settles a Suit</p>
        <p>Bertolli USA has settled a class-action suit brought in California by Beverly Blatt, who charged the company with making false health claims about the benefits of olive oil in an advertisement that ran in 1990. She claimed the ad falsely said that olive oil reduced blood pressure and blood sugar and that it reduced cholesterol more than other cooking oils do.</p>
        <p>Bertolli denied the charges. The Alameda County Superior Court expressed no opinion on the merits of the lawsuit.</p>

        <p>Bertolli Settles a Suit</p>
        <p>Bertolli USA has settled a class-action suit brought in California by Beverly Blatt, who charged the company with making false health claims about the benefits of olive oil in an advertisement that ran in 1990. She claimed the ad falsely said that olive oil reduced blood pressure and blood sugar and that it reduced cholesterol more than other cooking oils do.</p>
        <p>Bertolli denied the charges. The Alameda County Superior Court expressed no opinion on the merits of the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>As part of the terms of the settlement, Bertolli agreed to run advertisements next month in a number of national publications, with a 50-cent discount coupon for its olive oil. It will also refrain from running the 1990 ad again, which it had withdrawn after signing a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in 1990. There was no finding or admission of guilt in that settlement, either.</p>
        <p>All those who purchased Bertolli Olive Oil between Feb. 1, 1990 and Nov. 12, 1991, are automatically participants in the class action and will not be able to sue Bertolli over the same issue, unless they take steps to be excluded from the settlement.</p>
        <p>Michael Besso, the advertising director of Bertolli USA, would not comment on the settlement. Drinking by the Book</p>
        <p>"Michael Broadbent's Pocket Guide to Wine Vintages" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992, $11.95) is a practical companion for those who have put away wine for future drinking.</p>
        <p>It describes, year by year, the conditions of the vintage for most of the wine-growing regions of the world. For some regions, the advice covers the entire century. The most recent vintage covered is 1991. The book suggests, in general, which wines are ready to drink now, which are worth holding, and what their approximate shelf life might be.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has some expensive 1981 California cabernet sauvignon stored away might welcome Mr. Broadbent's advice to drink it now, as opposed to the 1980 vintage, which he said can be enjoyed over the next 5 to 10 years.  Jam, Without Cooking</p>
        <p>Making uncooked, fresh-fruit jams is easy with Garden Fare Freezer Jam Gelling Powder, just introduced by McCormick/Schilling. It thickens sweetened, finely chopped fresh fruit to spreading consistency. The mixture retains the bright flavor of fresh fruit but lacks the glossy intensity of fine preserves.</p>
        <p>Packed into sterilized jars, the jam can be stored in the refrigerator for several weeks and in the freezer for months. The gelling agent, carrageenan, is made from seaweed and requires less sugar than similar products made from pectin. If the mixture is still too sweet, lime juice can be added without interfering with the thickening. The company does not recommend adjusting the 1 1/2 cups sugar in the recipe that is printed on the package.</p>
        <p>Garden Fare costs about $1.10 a package, enough to make about 4 cups of jam. For more information: (800) 632-5847. Potatoes in a Pouch</p>
        <p>Sometimes, convenience is not inimical to quality. Take the new Windmill Farm brand of Dutch Guilder baby potatoes, vacuum-sealed packages of fresh peeled, already-cooked potatoes imported from the Netherlands and sold encased in plastic in the produce section of some supermarkets. Pop them into a heavy pan lightly glazed with oil, cook over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes, and you have beautiful, delicious, golden potatoes.</p>
        <p>Although unseasoned, they are tasty even without salting. They can also be heated by steaming, roasting, broiling or in a microwave oven. Their texture is a trifle soft for potato salad, but they could be used in a pinch.</p>
        <p>Each package carries a "use by" date that should be checked before buying. The potatoes cost $1.99 a pound and are sold at D'Agostino, Grand Union, King Kullen and Kings supermarkets.</p>
        <p>By midsummer, the company that is importing the potatoes, Malibu Farms of Los Angeles, plans to begin selling fresh, uncooked vegetables in supermarkets in New York and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The vegetables, which it has been selling to chefs for the last year, are cut into ovals and into those tiny, beadlike spheres sometimes found scattered on restaurant plates like confetti. Now, home cooks will be able to do what the chefs have done: instead of spending the day meticulously carving vegetables, just open a plastic bag.  Fresh Mexican Foods</p>
        <p>Authentico is a new wholesale producer of some splendid fresh Mexican products. Myra and Craig Dalland, both former chefs at El Teddy's in TriBeCa, started the company after unsuccessfully trying to open their own restaurant.</p>
        <p>Among their products are excellent crisp, paper-thin baked corn tortilla chips ($3.50 for 6 ounces) and several fresh salsas made with first-rate chilies, including salsa verde with tomatillos and serrano chilies, a ruddy tomatillo and chipotle salsa with decidedly smoky overtones, and complex salsa norteno with roasted tomatoes and poblano, arbol and serrano chilies. The salsas cost about $4.50 for 8 ounces.</p>
        <p>Sauces for cooking include a fragrant and spicy cilantro-chile pesto, a rich roasted tomato and chile sauce and an array of well-crafted Oaxacan-style mole sauces: negro, poblano, verde, amarillo and colorado. Most of the sauces sell for around $5 for 8 ounces.</p>
        <p>Authentico's products are sold at Marche Madison, 931 Madison Avenue (74th Street); Balducci's, 424 Avenue of the Americas (9th Street); Gourmet Garage, 47 Wooster Street (Broome Street); Adriana's Bazaar, 2152 Broadway (75th Street); Zabar's, 80th Street and Broadway, and Holiday Farms, 374 Roslyn Road, Roslyn Heights, L.I.</p>
        <p>The prices vary somewhat from store to store, as does the number of products carried.</p>
