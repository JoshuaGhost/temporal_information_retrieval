        <p>Furriers are smiling again. As the fashion shows introducing their new styles for next winter begin this week, furriers say they see the light at the end of the tunnel. Five years ago, a worldwide recession and sporadic attacks by animal-rights activists interrupted a 15-year growth in sales. A cold winter, a mild upturn in the economy and the reappearance last winter of women wearing furs have contributed to the feeling that the worst is over.</p>
        <p>"I'm not just cautiously optimistic, I'm very optimistic," said Ken Wagner, the head of Wagner Furs, for whom Oscar de la Renta has designed for 18 years. Early-season sales were up 27 percent from last year, he added.</p>

        <p>Furriers are smiling again. As the fashion shows introducing their new styles for next winter begin this week, furriers say they see the light at the end of the tunnel. Five years ago, a worldwide recession and sporadic attacks by animal-rights activists interrupted a 15-year growth in sales. A cold winter, a mild upturn in the economy and the reappearance last winter of women wearing furs have contributed to the feeling that the worst is over.</p>
        <p>"I'm not just cautiously optimistic, I'm very optimistic," said Ken Wagner, the head of Wagner Furs, for whom Oscar de la Renta has designed for 18 years. Early-season sales were up 27 percent from last year, he added.</p>
        <p>"I think we have a viable industry," said Aliki Christie, whose family business, Christie Brothers, was started in Europe in the last century. "Business began perking up last fall."</p>
        <p>Dennis Basso, who 12 years ago started the manufacturing company that bears his name, said: "Last year was a good fur year. It was cold." The Trend Is Long</p>
        <p>To fan this incipient prosperity, manufacturers and their designers have prepared tempting new styles. At the head of the list is the long coat, preferably in mink. Measuring 51 to 54 inches from neck to hem, the long coat ends in the vicinity of the ankles, thereby working equally effectively over trousers or skirts of any length.  It tends to have a slender but not taut shape, and is elaborated by swirls or scallops at the hem and bodice. It often has a slightly raised waistline.</p>
        <p>After several collections that featured multicolored furs in checks, plaids and tweedy patterns, Mr. de la Renta has focused on supple, simple mink coats, occasionally with sable trim. Since women are in the mood for furs again, he doesn't want to distract them with colors and patterns, he said.</p>
        <p>One area Mr. de la Renta is exploring is the luxurious cloth coat. The fabrics are camel hair or cashmere. The furs are Persian lamb, mink or beaver. The shapes are the same as the slender, elegant minks. Furriers are convinced, like the rest of the fashion world, that a big season for winter coats is coming up. They want to be part of it.</p>
        <p>Ben Kahn supplements his long mink and sable coats with casual reversible short coats that can be worn on their sheared mink side or their suede side. Mr. Basso gives some of his long mink coats a military edge, decorating them with gold buttons and echoing a prominent ready-to-wear theme.</p>
        <p>Short fur coats have a prominent place in the Christie Brothers collection, along with exotic natural furs like fisher, lynx and chinchilla. The short coats in sheared mink, beaver and nutria come in colors like coral, royal blue and green. They are recommended for ski country -- and for weekend strolling in big cities.</p>
        <p>Rounding out the casual coat story are raincoats with quilted silk panels and mink linings and a reversible broadtail coat trimmed with fisher that can be worn on either its fur or leather side. These coats are expected to complement the basic mink that fur enthusiasts already own.</p>
        <p>With dressmaker details like the pompon buttons that have become his trademark, braid effects at the collar and melon-shaped sleeves, Arnold Scaasi gives a couture glow to his furs for the Mohl Fur Company. Scaasi, Iin High Gear</p>
        <p>His show yesterday morning started the fur-show season and there was nothing low-key about it. The show opened with four long mink coats that the designer considers "basic." A coat can have a swirling hemline or can be made as simple as a bathrobe and still be basic, Mr. Scaasi said.</p>
        <p>He ended with fluffy Mongolian lamb coats in either black or white; a few jackets in red, green or purple were thrown in earlier.</p>
        <p>The pace hardly let up during the showing of 37 pieces. There were the red coats -- in cashmere with a big lynx collar and cuffs and in mink with gold buttons and braid. Just when the eye was recovering from the shock of the red coats, it was attracted by a long mink coat sheared into wide black and white chevrons.</p>
        <p>In the relatively quiet interludes, the designer offered a squirrel coat in soothing gray and beige tones or a beige corduroy coat with mink collar and cuffs. Like all the cloth coats, his corduroy style is lined in mink. A gray cashmere coat, for instance, has chinchilla rippling down the front. But the surprise is on the inside: the red squirrel lining. Probably for the woman who doesn't want to be too conspicuous, but doesn't want to be ignored either.</p>
