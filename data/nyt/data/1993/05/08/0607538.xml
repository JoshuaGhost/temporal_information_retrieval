        <p>A binational trade panel has handed Canada a major victory in a long-running dispute with the United States over trade in softwood lumber.</p>
        <p>The five-member Free Trade Agreement panel late Thursday essentially found that the Commerce Department had not made its case that Canada subsidized exports. On the basis of those subsidies, the United States imposes $200 million a year in duties on Canadian softwood, used mainly in home building.</p>
        <p>The panel said that the Commerce Department had not considered all the evidence or followed its own regulations in setting the duties. It instructed it to re-examine its findings on each of the key issues in the case and respond within 90 days.</p>
        <p>The duties stay in effect during the reconsideration process.</p>
        <p>In terms of trade volume, the softwood dispute is by far the most significant between the two countries under terms of the free trade pact. Canada last year shipped $4.4 billion in softwood to the United States. Despite the 6.5 percent tariff, shipments were up 14.6 percent form 1991.</p>
        <p>Canada's Trade Minister, Michael Wilson, hailed the decison as "very positive." Exports to the United States account for more than half of total Canadian lumber production. The industry is one of the major employers in Canada, where joblessness is 11 percent, half again as high as in the United States.</p>
        <p>In the last 40 years, the United States has used more lumber than it has produced and Canada has made up the difference. But in the last decade the American industry has been up in arms over what is now Canada's 29 percent penetration of the American market and has accused Canadians of unfair trade practices.</p>
        <p>A major complaint has been that the fees that Canadian provinces charge companies to harvest timber are less than what American lumber companies have to pay to cut timber on public and private land in the United States. The disparity, American producers say, gives Canadian exporters an unfair advantage, which entitles the United States industry to the protection of duties.</p>
        <p>The panel, addressing that point in its ruling, said the department should have considered whether provincial timber fees distorted normal competitive markets before concluding that they were a subsidy against which duties might be imposed.</p>
        <p>The Commerce Department had set the 6.5 percent countervailing duty a year ago. Many analysts here think the department will have to either eliminate or reduce it to meet the panel's standards.</p>
        <p>Adam Darling, a spokesman for the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration, said the department was "obviously disappointed." He declined further comment, noting that the department still had to digest the panel's "very dense" 170-page report.</p>
        <p>A Washington-based body representing the domestic American industry, the Coalition for Fair Lumber Imports, said the panel had "exceeded its authority" and "substituted its judgment for that of the responsibile U.S. agency."</p>
        <p>The Canadian lumber industry was ecstatic. "It's hard to imagine how we could have had a stronger decision from a binational panel," said Tom Buell, chairman of the Vancouver-based Canadian Forest Industries Council. "The binational panel today flunked the Commerce Department in Economics 101." Panels Set Up Under Pact</p>
        <p>Under the four-and-a-half-year-old Free Trade Agreement, binational panels are set up to determine whether laws of either country are correctly and fairly applied in trade decisions. Canada had insisted on this to allay its fear of arbitrary rulings by American Government agencies responding to protectionist pressures.</p>
        <p>Panels have been convened on dozens of trade fights with Canada in the last four years, with many decisions favoring Canada. Last month, a Canadian position was upheld in a conflict over exports of live swine that resulted in a refund to Canada of nearly $10 million in duties.</p>
        <p>The lumber panel comprised five trade experts: three Canadians and two Americans. Two each were initially chosen from each country and together they agreed on the fifth.</p>
        <p>Lumber prices rose dramatically last year, reflecting the shortage in the United States combined with an increase in home building and environmental restrictions on logging. Lately, prices have softened.</p>
