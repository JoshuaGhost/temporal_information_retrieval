        <p>Italy's new Prime Minister, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, won a first and important parliamentary confidence vote tonight that endorsed his new Government's proposals for political and economic reform.</p>
        <p>The vote in the lower house was 309 in favor of Mr. Ciampi's Government to 60 against, with 185 abstentions. The result reflected a decision to abstain by leading opposition groups, notably the Democratic Party of the Left, as Italy's former Communist Party is now named, and the Northern League.</p>
        <p>Both parties had said they would not vote against the eight-day-old administration, but would not formally support it either because of its ties to the parties that have dominated Italian politics for decades.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Ciampi himself is viewed as a nonpolitical figure, his Government draws parliamentary support from the same four-party coalition dominated by Christian Democrats and Socialists that he inherited from his predecessor, Giuliano Amato. 52d Cabinet Since War</p>
        <p>Mr. Amato stepped down last month after a referendum showed that a vast majority of Italians favored electoral reforms that would reduce the number of parties in Parliament and supposedly create more stable administrations. Mr. Ciampi's is the 52d postwar Italian government.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Socialists, deeply implicated in Italy's vast bribery scandal, threatened a walkout. But in a later reversal, they said they would support the Government. Those who opposed it tonight were small fringe groups like the neo-Fascists, hard-line Communists and the anti-Mafia Rete party, whose very existence is threatened by the proposed reforms to do away with proportional representation in Parliament and replace it with a direct voting system.</p>
        <p>Just before the vote, Mr. Ciampi, the former Central Bank Governor, renewed pledges to lead a stopgap administration devoted solely to rapid reform.</p>
        <p>"We need a new electoral system before the summer recess," he said in Parliament, referring to the recess in August. "If in the next few weeks it seems as if this aim is not going to be achieved, it would be a grave fault of this Government not to take the necessary measures."</p>
        <p>"This Government was born with the aim of electoral reform," he said in reply to questions from legislators about how long his administration would last. "Once the reforms have been approved, the decisions will be entrusted to you and the head of state."</p>
