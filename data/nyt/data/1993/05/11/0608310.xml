        <p>The Mets are 5-15 against non-expansion teasm. Before last night's game against the visiting Florida Marlins, the club was 1-6 in one-run games, without a victory in extra innings and 3-10 in its last 13 games at Shea Stadium. The Mets average stood at .230 and the bullpen was 0-7. So the Mets aren't in last place because of unrealized potential, but because of fully realized shortcomings. Any notion that the Mets can be rehabilitated in 1993 requires a great leap of faith, and the Mets Aren't too good at any kind of leaping these days. MANAGER WATCH</p>
        <p>The mananger won't be fired any time soon, or so ownership has said. Jeff Torborg, above, whose relaxed approach has come perilously close to becoming a detached approach, has done nothing to shake up his club. There has been talk of togetherness, of effort. It is only talk, and when it comes from Torborg, the players seem to ignore it. DUGOUT DECOMPRESSION</p>
        <p>Bobby Bonilla, right, the Met's first baseman of the future, might benefit from some time on the bench. His strikeout total is escalating disturbingly. The umpires don't have a good word to say about him; Shea fans say mostly boo, and maybe Bonilla and Mike Cubbage need to spend some quality time in the dugout talking over the game's finer points. HEY, BOBBY, SAY HI TO VINCE</p>
        <p>Speed. Speed. Speed. Manufactured runs. Menace on the basepaths. New York has heard enough about Vince Coleman's potential threat and seen not nearly enough. The leadoff man had a .285 on-base percentage before last night. Why not sit Coleman, get Joe Orsulak in a more comfortable spot in left, get center fielder Dave Gallagher's bat (.391) in the lineup for a couple of weeks and make the Mets a decent defensive team. TRADE EMBARGO</p>
        <p>The Mets say trading any significant player right now is impractical. Howard Johnson, right, has too much to prove at the moment to command from other clubs the value the Mets would want in return. Trading Sid Fernandez, even after his surgery, might net a useful player, but would leave a gaping hole in the No. 3 spot in the rotation. "The best we could probably do would be one of those change-of-scenery types of deals where both clubs would be taking huge gambles," said one official. 30 DAYS OF GOOD BEHAVIOR</p>
        <p>The Mets are one month of bad baseball away from 1993 irrelevance. They play the Cardinals and Expos this week and the Pirates and Phillies before the end of May. If they are 12 or more games out by then, the Mets are over and out. ONE MORE STOP BEFORE COOPERSTOWN</p>
        <p>The Mets, if they fail to mount an assault on repectability this month, could make the trading of Eddie Murray their first order of bargain-basement business. The first baseman's numbers are still high enough to give him marketplace value. Would the Braves, who need offense and who have a ton of prospects, be interested? AN UNEVEN ODD YEAR</p>
        <p>Bret Saberhagen, who began the year with a 74-30 career record in odd-numbered years, has only three victories this season, all against expansion teams. The right-hander has struggled to find his blowaway fastball and has had an occasionally cranky right shoulder. "I've been pitching stupid and I'm sick and tired of it," Saberhagen said last week. "My 7-year-old son has a better idea of how to pitch than I've had the last month." FOR PETE'S SAKE</p>
        <p>Perhaps Pete Schourek, the left-hander with the 1-3 record, would profit from a stint in the bullpen, or the minors. Let Eric Hillman start a couple of games, fool some teams, maybe and meanwhile reignite Schourek's focus and talent. And why not promote Kevin Baez and reassign backup infielder Tim Bogar? CHAPTER 11, FILING AT DEADLINE</p>
        <p>The Mets, if they are in the middle of nowhere in mid-summer, might declare their season bankrupt and stage a liquidation sale at the trading deadline. Johnson and Fernandez might garner a fair ransom of young talent.</p>
