        <p>Ten years after George Balanchine's death, the New York City Ballet's "Balanchine Celebration" obviously cannot include new works by the master.

        <p>Ten years after George Balanchine's death, the New York City Ballet's "Balanchine Celebration" obviously cannot include new works by the master. Yet this extraordinary two-month survey of Balanchine's choreography does include revivals of ballets that have been out of the company's repertory for so long that they come across as premieres to a new audience.</p>
        <p>Two of the season's most eagerly awaited rarities -- "Haieff Divertimento" and "Symphonie Concertante" -- were performed for the first time at the New York State Theater on Saturday night. Along with the familiar "Theme and Variations" and "Symphony in C," they were grouped under the umbrella title of "1947 Premieres" in one of the festival's special "theme" programs.</p>
        <p>To see these four imaginative ballets back to back is to presume that 1947 was a very good year for Balanchine. The esthetics are certainly not in dispute.</p>
        <p>Yet in terms of Balanchine's career, this program also suggested that 1947 was not necessarily the best of times. How easy it is to forget that there was no New York City Ballet 46 years ago and that Balanchine faced constant uncertainty. He was the freelancer par excellence, as this program's subtext made clear. Each of its ballets was choreographed for a different group of dancers.</p>
        <p>The Tchaikovsky "Theme and Variations" was produced for American Ballet Theater; the Bizet "Symphony in C," originally called "Palais de Cristal," was created for the Paris Opera Ballet.</p>
        <p>It was Balanchine's students at the School of American Ballet, however, who were given the task of making their way through one of his most intricate formal experiments in the classical idiom. Although the official premiere of the Mozart "Symphonie Concertante" was given in 1947 by Ballet Society, a forerunner of the City Ballet, the work was danced in 1945 by students, with Todd Bolender, a professional, in the sole male role.</p>
        <p>It was an ingenious and surprising idea to recall the ballet's origin by having it danced on Saturday with an all-student cast from the school.</p>
        <p>Like "Symphonie Concertante," the more intimate "Haieff Divertimento," created directly for Ballet Society, has not been seen at the City Ballet since the 1950's. Yet a 1985 revival by the Kansas City Ballet, directed by Mr. Bolender, gave this "lost" Balanchine work a new lease on life and it has been the subject of considerable curiosity. On first viewing, this engaging 15-minute piece does not come across as major Balanchine, possibly because it is burdened with a whiff of a sentimental "outsider" motif.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, this anecdotal pretext does not detract from the formal, quirky invention that runs through the choreography. Balanchine meets the Russian-born American composer, Alexei Haieff, on the same poetic, playful ground.</p>
        <p>"Divertimento," as the work was originally called, can be seen as one of the choreographer's experimental ballets to contemporary music, but it is also close to being a showcase for classical footwork like the 1957 "Square Dance."</p>
        <p>The City Ballet revival by Richard Tanner, based on Francisco Moncion's staging in Kansas City, is danced with straightforward zip and charm. The opening "Prelude" has four couples (Arch Higgins and Zippora Karz, Alexander Ritter and Kathleen Tracey, Robert Wersinger and Catherine Ryan, Russell Kaiser and Yvonne Borree) bowing. Nilas Martins, the loner, reaches out to an invisible partner.</p>
        <p>The ebullient dancing starts and stops after Wendy Whelan, in Holly Hynes's white tunic (the others are in turquoise and gray), begins the "Aria," essentially a duet with Mr. Martins. It is full of twisted, sculptured swoons and splayed fingers thrust toward a partner. The "Scherzo" features male solos and the meat comes in the ballerina's solo in the "Lullaby," with Miss Whelan's superlative rendering of the choreography's angular contours. In the "Finale," she perches, two feet parallel, on Mr. Martins's lap, only to disappear. The ballet is lighthearted: the hero will recover.</p>
        <p>"Symphonie Concertante" evoked a similar freshness. But its student corps -- and especially its impressive young principals, Tara Keim, Rachel Rutherford and Peter Hansen -- were also positively exultant. Still unformed dancers, they do not have the projection that Ballet Theater's principals make so emotional in their current production, staged from notation.</p>
        <p>Susan Pilarre's brilliant, faster-paced and more streamlined version here restores the youthful exuberance intended in Balanchine's visualization of Mozart's Symphonie Concertante in E flat. Miss Rutherford was the counterpart of the violinist in the pit, Nicolas Danielson, and Miss Keim was the equivalent of the violist, Warren Laffredo.</p>
        <p>A grand "tutu" ballet, the work is also a didactic exposition in which Balanchine equates classical dancing with classical music. He made the point more theatrically in the program's two other works, which include some of the same steps as in "Symphonie Concertante." "Theme and Variations" is an homage to the Russian classical ballet tradition. Nikolaj Hubbe, still slightly off on his timing and air turns, and a passive Judith Fugate were not quite the perfect generic prince and princess, but did decently enough. By contrast, "Symphony in C," Balanchine's nod to France, the birthplace of classical ballet, had the foolproof cast of opening night. Hugo Fiorato conducted.</p>
