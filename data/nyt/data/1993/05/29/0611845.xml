        <p>A bold decision by Pakistan's Supreme Court has advanced the cause of democracy and civilian rule in a country that has experienced too little of both.

        <p>A bold decision by Pakistan's Supreme Court has advanced the cause of democracy and civilian rule in a country that has experienced too little of both. The court ruled that President Ghulam Ishaq Khan exceeded his powers last month in dismissing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and dissolving Parliament.</p>
        <p>No less propitious is what didn't happen. As the reinstated Mr. Sharif remarked, this time Pakistan's powerful army "played its constitutional role by keeping out of politics."</p>
        <p>The 10-to-1 ruling in Islamabad, and its widespread acceptance, underscored the special status of bar and bench in a country founded by a formidable barrister, Mohammad Ali Jinnah. During long periods of martial rule ending in the 1980's, an independent judiciary struggled to contain the worst abuses. Now, in rejecting the President's right to dismiss a prime minister who holds a parliamentary majority, the Supreme Court has removed an arbitrary legacy of authoritarian rule.</p>
        <p>It is a pity that Mr. Sharif's spirited rival, Benazir Bhutto, finds herself on the wrong side this time. In 1990 the same President, under similar circumstances, dismissed Ms. Bhutto as Prime Minister, on the same charges of corruption and incompetence. When the Supreme Court then upheld the dismissal, she assailed its ruling. Now that the court has reversed itself, so has Ms. Bhutto, whose parliamentary supporters boycotted the vote of confidence won by the Prime Minister after the latest judgment.</p>
        <p>Americans have reason to welcome the restoration, with enhanced authority, of Mr. Sharif, a moderate conservative who faces hard times at home and crises abroad. Washington and Islamabad are at odds over Pakistan's longstanding effort to develop nuclear arms and its harboring of Islamic terrorists after the decade-long war against Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Bolstered by the court ruling, Mr. Sharif may finally be able to deal more effectively with Islamic extremists and tamp down Pakistan's nuclear rivalry with India. Both for the region and the world, the prospect of stabler, more resilient civilian government in Pakistan is indeed heartening.</p>
