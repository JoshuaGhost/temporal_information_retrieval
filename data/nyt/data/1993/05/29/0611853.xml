        <p>In a decision met with anger and dismay among blacks in Miami, a Hispanic police officer who was convicted there in 1989 on two counts of manslaughter in the shooting deaths of two young black men was acquitted today in a second trial on the same charges.</p>
        <p>William Lozano, the 33-year-old, Colombian-born police officer who has been the focal point of the most racially charged case in Florida in the last decade, threw his arms up in joy and embraced his lawyers when the verdict was announced late this afternoon.</p>
        <p>But relatives of the men he killed broke into tears and left the courtroom of Judge W. Thomas Spencer, saying they were at a loss to explain the decision of the six-member jury.</p>
        <p>The chief prosecutor in the case, John Hogan, conceded that he was disappointed in the verdict, but added that the jurors had performed honestly and fairly. He called on residents of Miami to accept the verdict calmly and not to resort to the violence that followed the slaying of the two men in 1989. Tonight there were scattered incidents in Miami, but nothing like the rioting four years ago.  [ Page 5. ]</p>
        <p>"It is my sincere hope that Miami never has to have a case like this again," Mr. Hogan said. "If it does have a case like this again, I think it is crucial that we be able to try the case in Miami. For that to happen, Miami has to show the maturity that we have been talking about, and it has to show it this weekend" in "the way it handles this verdict." Possibility of Federal Case</p>
        <p>He added, "This will be the ultimate test, and I am convinced we will pass it."</p>
        <p>United States Attorney Bob Martinez in Miami said in a statement that the authorities would begin an investigation to determine whether Mr. Lozano had violated any Federal civil rights laws.</p>
        <p>For months, officials and civic leaders have expressed concern that an acquittal of Mr. Lozano, setting aside the earlier verdict reached by a multi-ethnic jury in Miami, could result in an eruption of racial violence. Even though the court chose to wait four hours to announce the verdict so that law-enforcement agencies could prepare for any unrest, the decision still came at perhaps the worst possible time: the beginning of the long Memorial Day weekend, when people are not at work or school.</p>
        <p>After the verdict was announced Mr. Lozano and his principal lawyer, Roy Black, declined to answer questions about the case. But each made brief statements to reporters, praising Judge Spencer, the jury and each other.</p>
        <p>"We do believe in the justice system," Mr. Lozano said. "I'm just very happy I got my life back. Thank you."</p>
        <p>Later, in an interview with a Miami television station, Mr. Lozano added, "I don't want any police officer ever to have to go through what I have been through."</p>
        <p>The Lozano case, and its complex racial and legal implications, has transfixed Florida since Jan. 16, 1989, when Mr. Lozano fired a single shot at Clement A. Lloyd, a 23-year-old motorcyclist fleeing another police officer. Mr. Lloyd was killed instantly, and his passenger, Allan Blanchard, died as a result of the crash that followed.</p>
        <p>The shooting set off three nights of rioting that led to another death, hundreds of arrests or injuries and millions of dollars in property damage. Earlier Verdict Overturned</p>
        <p>In December 1989, a Miami jury found Mr. Lozano guilty of two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of Mr. Lloyd and Mr. Blanchard. Mr. Lozano was sentenced to seven years in prison, but in 1991 an appeals court overturned that decision on the ground that the jury may have feared an acquittal would prompt a new round of rioting.</p>
        <p>The Lozano case, which is the subject of intense debate on its own merits, has become even more complicated as a result of a case to which it is sometimes compared, the beating in Los Angeles of Rodney G. King, a black motorist, in March 1991 and the resulting state and Federal trials of the police officers who beat him. When a jury in Simi Valley, Calif., that had no black members acquitted those officers of all but one of 11 counts in April 1992 and racial unrest broke out in Los Angeles, legal experts and black community leaders across Florida warned that the Lozano case had the same explosive potential.</p>
        <p>The second trial for Mr. Lozano had been shifted five times among three cities in a search for a racially and ethnically balanced jury. Last spring, citing the rioting in Los Angeles and the need to provide "the perception of justice" to blacks angered by the outcome of of the Simi Valley trial, Judge Spencer ordered the Lozano trial moved from Orlando to Tallahassee.</p>
        <p>But that decision was challenged by other judges, and in March the case was sent back here from Tallahassee. In one of many unusual aspects of the case, Mr. Hogan joined Mr. Black in requesting that the trial leave Tallahassee, where the small Hispanic population raised questions about Mr. Lozano's status as a member of a minority group and his right to a fair trial</p>
        <p>The jury eventually seated here for Mr. Lozano's retrial consisted of three white, two Hispanic and one black member. The Miami jury that originally convicted him, and which has said publicly that its decision was not influenced by fears of more rioting, had three white, two black and one Hispanic member.</p>
        <p>Leaders of black community groups in Miami were critical of the decision to hold the second trial in a city that one of them called "the Simi Valley of Florida." They, like prosecutors, wanted the retrial to be held in Miami, where the number of blacks in the jury pool is roughly twice as large as in Orlando.</p>
        <p>There was also concern about Orlando's reputation as a bastion of law-and-order sentiment, a city whose residents regard Miami and surrounding Dade County as a violent and alien place. In November 1991, an all-white jury here acquitted Mr. Lozano's partner, Dawn Campbell, on charges that she had perjured herself when she testified on his behalf in his 1989 trial.</p>
        <p>During the two-week trial here, Mr. Black played to those negative images of Miami, frequently employing racial innuendo and portraying the police there as under constant siege. At various times, he called Miami the murder capital of the United States and the most violent city in America, while describing the Overtown area, which Mr. Lozano patrolled, as a den of criminality and drug use.</p>
        <p>In the retrial, five eyewitnesses, all of them black residents of Overtown, said Mr. Lozano had stepped into the street, had drawn his pistol and tracked Mr. Lloyd's motorcycle, traveling on the opposite side of the street from him, for several seconds before firing the fatal shot. Based on that testimony, Mr. Hogan argued that Mr. Lozano's behavior was reckless and in violation of established police procedure.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Black argued that the motorcycle was coming directly at his client and traveling more than 70 miles an hour; thus, he said, Mr. Lozano had to fire his gun to save his own life. Mr. Black, who in 1991 successfully defended William K. Smith in a rape trial in Palm Beach, also returned time and time again to inconsistencies among the various eyewitness accounts collected by prosecutors in the last four and a half years.</p>
        <p>"I think that was a problem," Mr. Hogan acknowledged this afternoon. "Our case, when everything else is said and done, is an eyewitness case, and I think the idea of four years going by makes it more difficult for people to believe an eyewitness. Obviously, the passage of time has an effect."</p>
        <p>In a dramatic shift of strategy from the first trial, Mr. Black also decided not to mount a defense, simply telling the judge and jurors that the prosecution had failed to prove its case. In the 1989 trial, Mr. Lozano was one of several witnesses called to the stand, offering testimony that legal experts said raised many new questions and probably contributed to his conviction.</p>
        <p>The jury reached its verdict this afternoon at about 12:30, after 6 hours and 13 minutes of deliberation that began late Thursday. But under the terms of an order issued by Judge Spencer at the request of Gov. Lawton Chiles and other officials, announcement of the verdict was delayed four hours to give National Guard units, the police and community relations officials in Miami time to prepare for any possible unrest.</p>
        <p>The charges against Mr. Lozano were initiated by Janet Reno, who is now Attorney General but at the time of the killing was the chief prosecutor in Miami.</p>
        <p>A Justice Department unit in Washington has been monitoring the case to determine whether Federal civil rights charges may also be brought against Mr. Lozano.</p>
        <p>"I'm not going to comment on that," said Mr. Hogan, who is scheduled to join Ms. Reno's staff in Washington now that the trial is over. "I think that is something that the U.S. Attorney's office in Miami would be the appropriate party to look at."</p>
        <p>Patricia Lloyd, a sister of the driver of the motorcycle, said the verdict was not fair. "There's never no justice for black people," she said. "It isn't finished yet."</p>
