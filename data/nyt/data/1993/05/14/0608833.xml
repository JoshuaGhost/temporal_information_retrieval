        <p>New York University celebrated its 161st commencement yesterday by honoring the memory of Arthur Ashe, the tennis great whose efforts to educate the public about AIDS before he died from the disease this year was the final chapter in a life dedicated to education and humanitarianism.</p>
        <p>More than 7,000 graduates and 10,000 guests applauded as Mr. Ashe's widow, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, accepted an honorary degree for her husband at the ceremony held in Washington Square Park.</p>
        <p>Another highlight of the ceremony was the presentation of a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree to the actor Alec Baldwin, who left the university in 1980, four credits shy of graduation, to work on a soap opera. Mr. Baldwin promised himself he would return and earn his degree, which he did this spring.</p>
        <p>The school's president, L. Jay Oliva, told graduates that years in learning and living in New York had given them special preparation for handling life's curves.</p>
        <p>"This city may be a lot of things, but a quiet, protected, pastoral setting, I think not," he said. "You represent every ethnic group, religion, and nationality and you already know what this country needs to know: how to live lovingly together and to care for one another." Hebrew Union College</p>
        <p>The New York School of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, at 1 West Fourth Street in Manhattan, celebrated its 118th commencement last night, and awarded degrees to 31 graduates.</p>
        <p>The main address was delivered by Robert S. Strauss, who was the Ambassador to Russia under President George Bush.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Strauss, six others were awarded honorary degrees at the ceremony: Victor Borge, the musician and humorist; the Rev. James Carpenter, director of the Center for Jewish-Christian Studies and Relations at the General Theological Seminary; Shmuel Eisenstadt, sociologist at Hebrew University in Jerusalem; Rudolph Forchheimer, a businessman who is a longtime supporter of the school; Jeshajahu Weinberg, director of the United States Holocaust Museum, and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive of The New York Times Company.</p>
