        <p>Watched by armed guards and locked behind bolted doors, more than 1,500 men, women and children, nearly all of them Muslims, remained crowded inside a former military base near here today while the United Nations and relief agencies pressed their Croatian captors for their release.</p>
        <p>The day after warring Bosnian Croats and Muslims signed an agreement promising to muzzle weapons, open roads and free civilians taken into custody during several days of heavy fighting, crucial provisions of the accord were still not being carried out by local commanders and soldiers scattered across this rugged region of south-central Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
        <p>Small arms and occasional mortar fire echoed from the steep mountain valley surrounding the embattled city of Mostar, and local Croatian and Muslim units were still blocking roads into nearby mountain valleys. The roads have been closed since tensions between the two sides worsened a month ago. The United Nations wants them opened to allow passage to its aid convoys and peacekeeping patrols.</p>
        <p>Officers with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees complained late today that they had been barred from moving food or other supplies to the Muslim civilians detained by Croatian forces. The civilians are held inside a military jail, two gymnasiums and a school building that are part of a former army base outside Mostar, in the Neretva River valley 40 miles northeast of the Adriatic coast.</p>
        <p>The Croats assured relief workers that they would release many of the Muslims soon, and had delayed doing it sooner only because they could not guarantee their safety, as the security situation around Mostar remained precarious. About 200 Muslims detainees whose safety was personally guaranteed by local Croats were released over the last two days, a relief worker said.</p>
        <p>But Croatian soldiers manning roadblocks refused to allow journalists access to the base where the civilians are held, amid growing complaints from Croatian officials, now repeated by many soldiers in the field, that reporters are unfairly portraying them as the villains in the recent surge in fighting in Mostar.</p>
        <p>In a measure of their growing sensitivity, Bosnian Croat military policemen today seized a two-man crew from Reuters television, confiscated their videotapes and escorted them across the border into Croatia, after they stopped inside the village of Ljubuski, about five miles south of here, to film a mosque that appeared to have been destroyed overnight. Later, the police in the town also detained three other journalists, holding them for four hours, after they came to the headquarters to ask permission to visit the military base where the Muslims are being held.</p>
        <p>At a checkpoint closer to Mostar, a Croatian militiaman with a hand grenade hanging from his belt berated reporters, saying they were writing only about the fate of the Muslims but ignoring Croats he said were trapped in mountain villages behind Muslim lines.</p>
        <p>"Why don't you get out of here and go to Konjic?" he asked, referring to a mostly Croatian village cut off from Mostar for the last month.</p>
        <p>In recent days, tension in the small towns around Mostar has risen sharply. Outside the barracks where Spanish troops serving in the United Nations peacekeeping force are billeted, soldiers on Wednesday were piling sandbags against windows and reinforcing a guard post with heavy timber, amid fears of possible reprisals by angry Croats who regard the United Nations as unsympathetic to their cause. Croats Move In Forces</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Bosnian Croats have been moving fresh soldiers into the area. On Tuesday night, a large military ambulance rumbled past, marked with the distinctive red cross. But inside there were more than a dozen armed soldiers, and the ambulance was towing a recoilless rifle.</p>
        <p>Tension between Bosnia's Croats and Muslims, once nominal allies against the rival Serbs, has been rising sharply in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>Under the peace plan drafted by Lord Owen and Cyrus R. Vance, which would divide the republic into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina would almost certainly come under Croatian control, with Mostar as its capital.</p>
        <p>While the area still officially remains a part of Bosnia, the Bosnian Croats, abetted by Croatia next door, have already declared their own mini-republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, complete with its own automobile license plates and postal stamps.</p>
        <p>According to workers who have been inside the compound, more than 70 percent of the Muslim civilians in custody are men, many of whom are viewed as possible combatants by their Croatian captors. The rest are women and children, many of whom were moved on Wednesday to a school building to ease overcrowding in two gymnasiums.</p>
        <p>Relief workers said few of the Muslims they had interviewed felt that they were being abused or mistreated by their captors, although they complained of inadequate food supplies and poor sanitary facilities, including overflowing toilets. On Wednesday, the only food many people received were two biscuits and a cup of milk.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the United Nations Protection Force, based in Zagreb, said fighting inside Mostar had eased today, as Croatian and Muslim commanders tried to enforce a cease-fire that they signed on Wednesday with Gen. Philippe Morillon, the commander of United Nations forces in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Casualty figures from the fighting remain uncertain, but Croatian commanders said today that they had counted 23 dead and more than 160 wounded since the fighting began. At least 10 Muslim soldiers are believed to have been killed, and as many as 100 people have been treated for wounds at a Muslim dispensary inside Mostar.</p>
        <p>While there were periods of heavy fire during the day today, including occasional exchanges of mortar fire, most of the fighting involved small arms and sniper fire. In parts of the city, people lounged outdoors in the spring sun, despite the shooting. Balkan Update</p>
        <p>The day after Bosnian Croats and Muslims signed an accord, key provisions were still not being carried out yesterday across BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.</p>
        <p>More than 1,500 Muslim men, women and children remained confined inside a military base near CITLUK. Fighting between Croats and Muslims continued in MOSTAR. Serbs staged a major attack on Muslims in BRCKO.</p>
        <p>In LOZNICA, about 5,000 Serbian nationalists rallied, vowing never to accept an international peace plan.</p>
        <p>United Nations officials said they would airlift 230 more wounded people from the Muslim enclave of ZEPA.</p>
        <p>In BRUSSELS, the Clinton Administration's impasse with the European allies on the Balkans was leaving the North Atlantic Treaty Organization adrift.</p>
        <p>In COPENHAGEN, the European Community warned Croatia that it faces sanctions because of attacks by ethnic Croats on Muslims.</p>
        <p>In WASHINGTON, President Clinton said he was "skeptical" about this weekend's referendum by Bosnian Serbs.</p>
