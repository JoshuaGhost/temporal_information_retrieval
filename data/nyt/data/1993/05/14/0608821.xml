        <p>Two men who law-enforcement officials say took part in a conspiracy to murder a crusading Spanish-language journalist in a Queens restaurant on orders from a Colombian cocaine cartel are also suspects in the slaying of two Baltimore businessmen.</p>
        <p>The businessmen were gunned down, also at the behest of the cartel, in a warehouse parking lot a little more than six months before the journalist, Manuel de Dios Unanue, was killed on March 11, 1992, in the Meson Asturias in Elmhurst because articles he had written had angered the Colombian traffickers, the investigators said.</p>

        <p>Two men who law-enforcement officials say took part in a conspiracy to murder a crusading Spanish-language journalist in a Queens restaurant on orders from a Colombian cocaine cartel are also suspects in the slaying of two Baltimore businessmen.</p>
        <p>The businessmen were gunned down, also at the behest of the cartel, in a warehouse parking lot a little more than six months before the journalist, Manuel de Dios Unanue, was killed on March 11, 1992, in the Meson Asturias in Elmhurst because articles he had written had angered the Colombian traffickers, the investigators said.</p>
        <p>The cocaine traffickers killed the businessmen, the investigators say, because one of the businessmen had been representing the cartel based in Cali, Colombia, in the purchase and refurbishing of a freighter and was believed to have kept some of the money from the multimillion-dollar deal for himself. The link to the de Dios case was reported earlier this week in other newspapers.</p>
        <p>Details of the connection came from law-enforcement officials as another young Colombian was indicted yesterday in the death of the journalist.</p>
        <p>Investigators said the man indicted yesterday, Elkin Farley Salazar, accompanied the 17-year-old gunman who is accused of firing two shots into Mr. de Dios 14 months ago. The accused gunman, Alejandro Wilson Meja Velez, and John Mena were indicted on Monday in the killing of the journalist. Mr. Mena is one of the suspects in the Baltimore slayings.</p>
        <p>At about 9 P.M. Mr. Salazar and Mr. Meja walked into Meson Asturias, investigators said, and two other conspirators pointed out the journalist. The investigators said the gunman and Mr. Salazar then left. Moments later, Mr. Meja returned, shot Mr. de Dios in the head and fled to a waiting car that Mr. Salazar was driving, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salazar, 25 years old, pleaded not guilty in an arraignment in Federal District Court in Brooklyn late yesterday afternoon before Judge Edward R. Korman.</p>
        <p>Mary Jo White, the acting United States Attorney in Brooklyn, would not detail when and where Mr. Salazar was arrested, because, she said, the investigation is continuing. But investigators said he was arrested several weeks ago on a sidewalk in Astoria, Queens, and that, like Mr. Meja, when he was seized last Saturday in Miami, he did not resist.</p>
        <p>Law-enforcement officials say that four other suspects have been arrested in connection with the journalist's slaying, but that the indictments against them have been sealed because the investigation is continuing. Several other suspects, the officials said, are being sought. Murderous Web Alleged</p>
        <p>The law-enforcement officials say that the accused killer of Mr. de Dios was at the end of a chain of murder subcontracting that began when Mr. Mena, who worked for the Cali cartel, offered $20,000 to have the job done. Everyone along the line took a cut, the officials say, and the gunman may have received as little as $1,500.</p>
        <p>The first person that Mr. Mena turned to for the killing, the officials said, was Juan Carlos Velasco, who was widely known as Leo.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Velasco, the officials said, who is suspected of going to Baltimore and shooting the businessmen. Mr. Mena went with him, the officials said, and is believed to have driven a car from which Mr. Velasco fired the fatal shots from a .44-caliber revolver. No one has yet been indicted in the Baltimore case.</p>
        <p>The law-enforcement officials said that in the course of the inquiry into the journalist's death, investigators were told that Mr. Velasco and Mr. Mena had planned and carried out the Baltimore killings. The investigation stretched across the country and two continents and involved members of the Queens homicide unit of the New York City Police Department and a task force, called Red Rum, of Federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents, officers from the state police and New York City Police. Red Rum is murder spelled backward.</p>
        <p>Mr. Velasco, the law-enforcement officials say, hired a man nicknamed Cabezon, or Big Head, to shoot the journalist and he, in turn, hired Mr. Mejas and Mr. Salazar. In addition, the officials say, it was Mr. Velasco and his wife, Elizabeth, who pointed out Mr. de Dios to the gunman in the restaurant.</p>
        <p>No charges against the Velascos have yet been made public, but law enforcement officials said they are being held in protective custody.</p>
