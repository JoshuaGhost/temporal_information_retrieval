        <p>An influential Congressman said today that managed competition, the health policy favored by President Clinton, is "a fairy tale" and would probably not be the basis for any legislation passed by Congress to overhaul the nation's health-care system.</p>
        <p>Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, made the comments as he issued a report from the Congressional Budget Office. The report said the strategy of managed competition could reduce health-care spending, but the study expressed doubt whether Americans were willing to make the radical changes needed to achieve such savings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark's comments came 15 days after Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the Ways and Means Committee, ridiculed managed competition by likening it to supply-side economics and "Star Wars." Quite apart from the merits of such criticism, it appears that the two Democrats are pleading publicly with the Administration to scale down and reconsider its plan to overhaul the health-care system. Clinton Faces Party Critics</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark's position is no surprise. For years, he has argued that Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly, should be expanded to cover all Americans. But the comments of Mr. Stark and Mr. Rostenkowski show that the President will have to deal with critics in his own party, including lawmakers who will be responsible for shepherding Mr. Clinton's proposal through Congress.</p>
        <p>As chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rostenkowski has a large role in writing health-care legislation and tax bills. Mr. Clinton has said he intends to send his proposal to Congress next month.</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton and her task force on health care say they have consulted extensively with Congress. But Mr. Stark said: "We are kept in the dark. We have been asked to support a bill or a plan without knowing the details."</p>
        <p>Advocates of managed competition say it will empower consumers. Under the plan, individuals and small businesses would pool their resources and buy health care from competing networks organized by doctors, hospitals and insurance companies. In theory, these networks would vie with one another by offering high-quality care at low prices. Dissent From White House</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office observed that managed competition "has not been tried anywhere in the world." Mr. Stark likened it to a unicorn, "a beautiful animal in fairyland, but unseen on earth."</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark said one of the problems with managed competition is that hardly anybody "can explain it." Indeed, he said, with reference to President Clinton, "I don't think he knows what it is."</p>
        <p>Robert O. Boorstin, a White House spokesman, said: "We have not completely reviewed the report by the Congressional Budget Office. But I don't believe that it is a valid critique of the plan we are going to arrive at."</p>
