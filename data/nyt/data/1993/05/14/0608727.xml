        <p>President Clinton today named David R. Hinson, an aerospace executive and former Navy fighter pilot, to head the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinson, 60, has firsthand experience with the kind of financial problems now besetting the industry, having served as chairman of Midway Airlines a small, scrappy Chicago-based carrier that was crushed two years ago by its $153 million debt.</p>
        <p>He would be the first administrator with wide experience in military and general aviation, domestic carriers and aircraft manufacturing. He has more than 9,000 flying hours piloting 70 different aircraft, from DC-3's to MD-11's.</p>

        <p>President Clinton today named David R. Hinson, an aerospace executive and former Navy fighter pilot, to head the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinson, 60, has firsthand experience with the kind of financial problems now besetting the industry, having served as chairman of Midway Airlines a small, scrappy Chicago-based carrier that was crushed two years ago by its $153 million debt.</p>
        <p>He would be the first administrator with wide experience in military and general aviation, domestic carriers and aircraft manufacturing. He has more than 9,000 flying hours piloting 70 different aircraft, from DC-3's to MD-11's.</p>
        <p>In his new job, he would oversee the safety of the aviation industry and be responsible for initiating and enforcing safety regulations and operating the air traffic control system.  Reticence on Policy</p>
        <p>"Aviation is technically demanding and requires careful attention," Mr. Hinson said in a telephone interview from Long Beach, Calif., where he is executive vice president for marketing and business development of McDonnell Douglas, the aircraft maker. He declined to discuss policy until his Senate confirmation hearings.</p>
        <p>A man known for both his high energy and his avuncular style, Mr. Hinson won a reputation for being able to initiate sweeping changes while ruffling few feathers. Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, described Mr. Hinson as "a low-key person with a lot of resolve who makes certain that his goals are reached."</p>
        <p>Mr. Landry predicted that Mr. Hinson would take a tough stance against increasing the number of regulations. "This is a man who's seen the impact that regulations can have on airlines, and I would expect that he would insist on rigorous cost-benefit analysis before approving any new regulations," Mr. Landry said.</p>
        <p>In addition to reviewing proposed regulations, Mr. Hinson will immediately face the task of carrying out President Clinton's decision to enable air-traffic controllers dismissed in the 1981 strike to apply for their former jobs. This involves setting criteria for their re-entry, and planning their training.</p>
        <p>He would also face the task of speeding the development of a new air-traffic control system that is years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinson gained national attention as founder and chairman of Midway. He was one of the three original investors when the airline was founded in 1979, and attended its demise in 1991.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hinson was born March 2, 1933, in Muskogee, Okla. He received his undergraduate degree from the University of Washington, and a graduate degree in business administration from Stanford University.</p>
