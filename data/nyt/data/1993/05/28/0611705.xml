        <p>President Clinton today endorsed a compromise on ending the ban on homosexuals in the military, emphasizing that the Government should not "appear to be endorsing a gay life style."</p>
        <p>The President offered support for the approach of "don't ask, don't tell" -- the label given to a range of plans that would allow homosexuals to serve but leave limits on how open they could be about their sexuality.</p>
        <p>"We almost have a compromise here," Mr. Clinton said in a nationally televised question-and-answer session with tourists this morning in the White House Rose Garden. "Most Americans believe if you don't ask and you don't say and you're not forced to confront it, people should be able to serve." A Distancing Tactic</p>
        <p>The President's remarks on homosexuals in the military, which came in response to a question from a pastor who said he was worried about Christian values, seemed calculated to put some distance between himself and gay rights groups.</p>
        <p>"We are trying to work this out so that our country does not -- I understand what you're saying -- so that our country does not appear to be endorsing a gay life style," he said. "But we accept people as people, and give them a chance to serve if they play by the rules."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's remarks came toward the end of two-hour appearance on "CBS This Morning" in which he probably endured the most aggressive questioning in such a forum on a variety of topics, including these:</p>
        <p>*He confirmed that he would extend China's favorable trade status for one year to help that country's modernization drive. But he said any future renewal would depend on the China's making gains on human rights.</p>
        <p>*He blamed reporters for making too much of the expensive haircut he got on Air Force One, delaying traffic at the Los Angeles International Airport. "I mean look, I wear a $40 watch," he said. "Do I look like the kind of guy that would go and sit on an airport? You know it was just a blow up." In jest, he added, "I'm glad they didn't find out about the manicure."</p>
        <p>*He defended his aides' calling in the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine accusations of mismanagement at the White House travel office, a move that was done without the knowledge of Attorney General Janet Reno. Mr. Clinton said that while there was no policy to alert the Attorney General on internal White House matters, he would do so in the future "because I trust her."</p>
        <p>*He was unenthusiastic when asked whether the cost of abortion should be covered in a national health care package, saying no decision had been made. He said a broad package was essential rather than a limited one "that's not worth a nickel."</p>
        <p>*He said it was "absolutely not true" that his Administration had become infatuated with Hollywood and celebrities. Questioning why the reporters focused on two meetings in the White House with celebrities, he said, "When my preacher from Arkansas stayed here, nobody wrote it up."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton did not spell out any policy specifics. But his comments mark what some gay rights groups today called a retreat from his campaign pledge to fully overturn the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces. Different Meanings</p>
        <p>As for the issue of homosexuals in the military, proponents of "don't ask, don't tell" have used the term to mean different things.</p>
        <p>Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Armed Services Committee, has argued for a policy in which the military would not ask members of the armed forces about their sexual orientation, and opposes their being open about their homosexuality, on or off duty.</p>
        <p>Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who is open about his own homosexuality, has pressed for a far more lenient policy in which homosexuals could be open about their sexual orientation off duty but silent while on duty. But the various proposals are all based on a sense that Congress would not allow homosexuals to serve openly without restrictions.</p>
        <p>At the Pentagon, where officials have until July 15 to deliver a proposal on the issue to the White House, officials said they were toying with language that is closer to Mr. Frank's recommendation. But they also said they were still trying to determine how to impose consistent regulations guiding the activities of servicemen and servicewomen on and off duty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frank, who angered many gay rights groups last week when he proposed a compromise, said he did not know if the President was accepting his proposal. But he, as did some homosexual groups, objected to Mr. Clinton's comments today on life style.</p>
        <p>"It seemed to me somewhat gratuitous," he said. "One theory is that he is saying that as cover" so he can move ahead and press for allowing homosexuals in the military.</p>
        <p>Speaking tonight on the Senate floor, Mr. Nunn commended the President, saying that he had "made it clear that any resolution of this debate should not appear to be endorsing any particular life style."</p>
        <p>While he spoke only generally about Mr. Clinton's comments, the Senator flatly rejected Mr. Frank's proposal, asserting that permitting members of the armed forces to be open about their homosexuality off base would provide a "safe haven for homosexual conduct," leading to "a dramatic liberalization of military standards."</p>
        <p>Today's remarks were the first in two months that Mr. Clinton has spoken extensively about homosexuals in the military, an issue that has dogged him since his election. Pentagon officials said the Administration had all but abandoned any consideration of separating troops by sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>Although it had been clear that Defense Department officials and lawmakers were moving toward a consensus, some homosexual organizations criticized Mr. Clinton today for saying he was willing to accept some form of the "don't ask, don't tell" approach.</p>
        <p>" 'Don't ask, don't tell' does not lift the ban, it simply reformulates it, and does so in an 'Alice in Wonderland' fashion," said Thomas B. Stoddard, coordinator of the Campaign for Military Service. "At its essence, it says that soldiers can continue to serve if they're gay so long as they pretend not to be gay."</p>
        <p>While Mr. Clinton had toyed with addressing the nation on the eve of the House vote on his economic package, White House officials decided instead to accept a long-standing offer to appear today on "CBS This Morning."</p>
        <p>Advisers to the President say he is often at his best taking questions from the public. But today he was often on the defensive.</p>
        <p>In addressing the controversy over his haircut, he said he asked Secret Service agents whether "anybody would be held up or inconvenienced and I was told, 'No.' " He added: "I'd never do that. Not in 100 years. Not ever. I mean, I wasn't raised that way."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton elaborated: "I think you've got to learn to laugh at things like that. You know, when little things get made big and big things get made little, you know, and you make a boner." He added that "if you didn't have a sense of humor in this business, you'd be grounded down to nothing pretty quick."</p>
