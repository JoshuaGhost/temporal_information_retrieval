        <p>The Morgan Stanley Group announced record quarterly profits yesterday, sharing fully in Wall Street's boom times.</p>
        <p>The net income of $198.8 million was nearly 40 percent higher than analysts' estimates, and helped raise Morgan Stanley's stock sharply.</p>
        <p>The quarterly profit would have been larger but for a $29 million pretax loss on a loan made in 1990 to Sweetheart Holdings, a paper cup manufacturer that Morgan Stanley has agreed to sell to American Industrial Partners. The $29 million loss was in addition to $70 million the company subtracted from its profits in 1992 to create reserves for loan losses it expected.</p>
        <p>At a time of record amounts of new stock and bond offerings, the company said revenues from investment banking totaled $378.8 million, up 40 percent from a year earlier and 66 percent from the previous quarter.</p>
