        <p>Spurred by an arms race that is spreading from China to Indonesia, Japan and other Asian nations have warily begun talks to set up their own regional security forum, a fundamental change in defense policy for countries that have never been able to form alliances and have always relied on the United States to keep peace in the Pacific.</p>
        <p>In a meeting here over the last few days, with the blessing and participation of the Clinton Administration, senior government officials from throughout the region met for the first time to talk about threats to the area's stability, from an outbreak of piracy in the South China Sea to the containment of North Korea and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.</p>
        <p>But Asian officials said the new talk of cooperation was also being driven by growing distrust of China's growing economic power and the military buying spree it has touched off. Their fear is that Japan, rattled by China's action and fearful of North Korea's nuclear program, will drift toward rearmament itself.</p>
        <p>Since World War II, Asian countries have relied on the United States to keep Asia's many powers in check. That approach was reinforced by the Bush Administration, which talked often of a "hub and spoke" series of alliances with America at the center, and saw little need for additional security structures. Now many Asian leaders are coming to the opposite conclusion. 'A Dramatic Departure'</p>
        <p>"What we are seeing now is a dramatic departure, really a revolution, in the way Asian countries have dealt with each other," said Chan Heng Chee, Singapore's former delegate to the United Nations and now the director of the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies here. "Until now, we have only cooperated with each other on economic matters. But perceptions of the changing nature of the American role is making us begin to think that we must change also."</p>
        <p>Over the last two weeks, Winston Lord, the State Department's top official for Asia, has traveled to all of the region's major capitals to repeat the message that the Clinton Administration plans to remain "fully engaged" in the region. And William J. Perry, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, told South Korean and Japanese officials last week that troop reductions in Asia were unlikely to go much further than those already announced.</p>
        <p>No one yet knows exactly what form the new Asian mutual security framework will take, or even whether it will move much beyond a forum for dialogue. The first meeting simply resulted in a series of declarations of concern, especially about the violence in Cambodia and the intransigence of North Korea.</p>
        <p>"We're a long, long way from considering collective action," a participant said. Indonesia, for example, has said it is opposed to any agreement that would bind members to go to the defense of another. Alliances Elude Region</p>
        <p>Asia has never had an alliance resembling NATO, or even a loose forum akin to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Southeast Asian Treaty Organization, set up in 1954 after the French defeat in Indochina, dissolved after about 20 years and was driven mostly by the United States, Australia and European powers.</p>
        <p>With the distances across the Pacific so vast, and national interests so divergent, it was always assumed any move toward collective Asian security would fail. Even today many doubt whether the new initiatives will be able to surmount the lingering bitterness from wars past, the continuing suspicions of Japan, or any number of territorial disputes.</p>
        <p>But the ideological divisions that once divided Asia along Communist and non-Communist lines, leading to the Korean and Vietnam wars, have effectively blurred into oblivion. Instead, the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, now say that the chief motive for assuring regional security is simply to protect the world's fastest-growing economies.</p>
        <p>Asean is made of Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines and was formed to accelerate economic progress and stability in the region.</p>
        <p>At the meeting here in Singapore there was even preliminary talk about bringing two of the remaining Communist powers, China and Vietnam, into the security framework, though there were sharp differences over how. Money from the rest of capitalist Asia is pouring into factories and other investments in both Communist countries at such an astounding pace that many politicians and business executives are calling for mechanisms to defuse any security tensions before they could threaten profits.</p>
        <p>But the Japanese and others are reluctant. "We want to hear what China has to say, but on the other hand China is still a totalitarian nation," a senior Japanese offiical noted recently. "It is not one of us." On Arms Buying Spree</p>
        <p>In many ways, wealth has suddenly become as destabilizing as the threat of spreading Communism ever was. Suddenly able to afford just about anything in the world's weapons catalogues, countries throughout Asia have gone on an unparalleled arms buying spree over the last year, one that the rest of the world has been only too happy to feed.</p>
        <p>The initiative for the new security forum came from an unlikely source: the Japanese. Looking for a non-threatening way to increase its regional political role, Tokyo suggested organizing regular top-level security conferences. The Bush Administration's enthusiasm for the idea, however, was only lukewarm, and former Secretary of State James A. Baker III angered Japanese officials when he spoke of maintaining the "hub and spokes" series of bilateral relationships, with the United States at the hub, but said nothing of regional security.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration also believes in hubs and spokes, but sees much room for other security arrangments as well. That thinking has been reinforced as South Korea, Japan and the United States -- and more haltingly, China -- have worked together in recent months to force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons project.</p>
        <p>"It has been a critical experience for all of us, and it has changed the way we relate to each other," a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official said recently of North Korea's nuclear arms program.</p>
