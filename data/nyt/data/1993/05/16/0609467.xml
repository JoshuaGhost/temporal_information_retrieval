        <p>IT was almost time for the evening news and Tom Jones, a night creature of long standing, having so far seized a small part of the day with a run on the boardwalk and breakfast, sat in an Atlantic City casino hotel suite considering his re-emergence into pop-culture consciousness. "I just do what I do," he said. "If people think it's hip, well, thank God."</p>
        <p>That night, as he prepared for the final performance in a five-day stint at Tropworld, a familiar though slightly less-than-hip haunt, the singer was packing for a trip to Manhattan, where he would headline for the first time since a Madison Square Garden concert 20 years ago. His venue for this against-type appearance was Limelight, the substantially more hip club in Chelsea.</p>

        <p>IT was almost time for the evening news and Tom Jones, a night creature of long standing, having so far seized a small part of the day with a run on the boardwalk and breakfast, sat in an Atlantic City casino hotel suite considering his re-emergence into pop-culture consciousness. "I just do what I do," he said. "If people think it's hip, well, thank God."</p>
        <p>That night, as he prepared for the final performance in a five-day stint at Tropworld, a familiar though slightly less-than-hip haunt, the singer was packing for a trip to Manhattan, where he would headline for the first time since a Madison Square Garden concert 20 years ago. His venue for this against-type appearance was Limelight, the substantially more hip club in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>Something awfully unusual is happening here.</p>
        <p>After years of toiling in the lucrative velvet purgatory of casino showrooms, of sharing an aging-sexpot-crooner image with the likes of Engelbert Humperdinck, Mr. Jones, 52, who was born in Wales, is fashioning what appears to be a burgeoning comeback. A combination of solid singing and ironic self-effacement has brought Mr. Jones to the brink of the kind of fame he first knew when his newest fans were infants.</p>
        <p>His son, Mark Woodward (Mr. Jones was born Thomas Jones Woodward), who manages his father's singing career, admitted that "there is a fear that people are just bringing him on because there is this sniggle factor -- you know, 'Here's this hip-swiveling sex symbol and that's all the package.' "</p>
        <p>But, he added, "I'm having less fear of that lately."</p>
        <p>These days, irony has a way of eating its own tail. Judging from audience reaction to performances in Atlantic City and at Limelight last week, a significant number of Tom Jones fans, particularly the younger ones, have already calculated the sniggle factor and actually think it adds to the equation. Besides, in today's high-turnover commercial culture, where everything old is sold again, listening to Tom Jones has no higher sniggle quotient than, say, buying an expensive new pair of bell-bottoms. It's possible to be hip and campy all at once.</p>
        <p>Consider the evidence:</p>
        <p>* Mr. Jones appeared recently as an animated version of himself in "The Simpsons."</p>
        <p>* In March, he was the surprise hit of an all-star Carnegie Hall concert to benefit the rain forest projects of the rock singer Sting. At a dinner afterward, Dustin Hoffman told him that when he opens his mouth to sing it seems like an animal jumped out.</p>
        <p>* He can now be seen regularly on VH1, the adult video music network, as host of a six-part series, "Tom Jones: The Right Time," giving a whirlwind briefing on the history of pop music in which he leaps from a classic soul duet with Sam Moore of Sam and Dave to performing "It's Unbelievable" with the British pop group E.M.F.</p>
        <p>* He has new young friends ("the lads," as Mr. Jones affectionately calls them) like Jason Priestly and Luke Perry, who had listened to Tom Jones while relaxing on the set of "Beverly Hills 90210" and arranged to get an introduction to him. Mr. Perry visits Mr. Jones's Hollywood home; Mr. Priestly flew to Las Vegas for a performance. There is talk of a guest spot next season on "90210."</p>
        <p>* He discusses the size of his penis in a cable television interview with Howard Stern. Mr. Stern, in another interview on his radio show, tweaks record company executives for not having a recording contract with Mr. Jones. (A deal is now in the works.)</p>
        <p>"Oh that," Mr. Jones said of his very public privates talk with Mr. Stern. "I told him those things because he asked me, and I'm not frightened of anything. I've always been wide open." The singer still speaks in a mellow Welsh accent, emphasizing points by widening his green eyes. His curly hair is graying slightly at the temples. But as he began talking, Mr. Jones seemed like an enthusiastic young man having a pint with the lads in a pub. "A lot of stars try to create an image because they think that if there's a mystery there it'll keep them going longer," he said. "I don't believe that. You don't have to have a moody bloody thing going or be aloof. If you have a basic talent and you do it, people can see it and hear it. I don't have to go thinking about my image."</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones has never been moody or aloof. He emerged from the tough working-man nightclubs of South Wales in the early 60's as a hard-edged rock-and-roller, a disciple of Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis. Early on, he developed the performing style that would become his trademark.</p>
        <p>"One night I started to move in a suggestive way," Mr. Jones once said. "Something inspired me. People stopped dancing to watch me, and I began to move even more with a lot of sexy gyrations. The chicks were really excited. It worked then and it's worked ever since." For a time, Mr. Jones called himself "Tiger Tom, the Twisting Vocalist."</p>
        <p>Despite his rock roots, Mr. Jones's first hit record was the bouncy, horn-filled "It's Not Unusual" in 1965. His next was an odd, near-novelty song by Burt Bacharach called "What's New Pussycat?" There were two main roads in pop music at the time -- one to Liverpool, one to Hollywood. The young Tom Jones went West.</p>
        <p>From 1969 through 1971, he was host for a prime-time, hourlong musical variety show on ABC, "This Is Tom Jones." Bouncing from Sly Stone to June Allyson to Sammy Davis Jr., the program made Mr. Jones a big star. His albums sold in the millions. but with his velvet tuxedos, wide-open shirts and undulating hips, he became known more as an entertainer and sex symbol than as a singer. In 1970, Jackie Collins wrote a movie script for the singer to star opposite her sister Joan. It was an adaption of "The Stud." Mr. Jones thought it was too dirty.</p>
        <p>Because he wrote none of his own material, Mr. Jones was dependent on good songs coming to him. "That stopped happening in the '70's," he said. He settled into a heavy touring schedule and long engagements in the showrooms of Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>It was there that a manifestation of adulation from his female fans -- what the singer has come to call tartly "the underwear thing" -- reached its apogee. "The underwear thing was great at the time," Mr. Jones said. "It had never happened to any entertainer before -- for women to actually take their underwear off and toss it up."</p>
        <p>A ritual developed wherein Mr. Jones would wipe his brow with one of the offerings and toss it back. "But that thing took over," he said. "After a while, people would say, 'Oh yeah, Tom Jones, women throw their underwear at him.' Now I want to re-establish myself as a singer."</p>
        <p>The Tom Jones who takes the stage today has pared down his persona. Gone is the big backup orchestra, replaced by an eight-piece band and a trio of backup vocalists. The singer has decided to look and act his age (almost). He wears conservative designer suits that reveal his muscular and slightly pudgy frame, but not too much of it. Tiger Tom now swivels his hips sparingly.</p>
        <p>Last Sunday night, in the Tropworld Showroom, Alvin Krell of Sheepshead Bay had assembled nearly his entire family -- wife, mother-in-law, two daughters in their 20's -- all looking to rediscover Tom Jones. "We used to see him 20 years ago," Mr. Krell said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Krell's wife, Sue, along with many other fifty-something women in the audience, seemed more nostalgic than excited. "I remember when his pants used to be skintight," Mrs. Krell said to her mother, sounding a little disappointed.</p>
        <p>By the end of the fifth song, not one pair of underwear had hit the Tropworld stage. Several cocktail waitresses of long standing at the casino said later that the panty count was way down in Mr. Jones's recent performances. "We found one pair under a table the last time he was here," one said. "I guess she lost her nerve."</p>
        <p>Between songs, a woman in the front rows shouted to Mr. Jones that she had brought him Welsh cakes, and he accepted a bucket of them, leaning down to give his fan a kiss.</p>
        <p>"There you go," Mr. Krell said. "They used to throw their underwear, now they bring Welsh cakes. He's gettin' old."</p>
        <p>After hearing the singer perform Prince's "Purple Rain" and "Kiss" and hearing that 25-year-old Pamela Krell liked the show, her father concluded, "I guess he's going for the younger audience."</p>
        <p>" 'Kiss' was really the turning point for me," Mr. Jones said the next day, "as far as the public -- the pop-conscious public -- is concerned."</p>
        <p>In 1986, after his longtime manager, Gordon Mills (who'd written "It's Not Unusual"), died, Mr. Jones installed his son as manager (his daughter-in-law, Donna Woodward, became his publicist) and Mr. Woodward pushed him toward newer material. His family is his entourage.</p>
        <p>Despite his image as a decadent hipster, Mr. Jones has been married for 36 years to the former Melinda Trenchard. They grew up together in Treforest, Wales, and married when they were both 16 and she was pregnant with their only child, Mark. Since the mid-1970's, they have lived in Bel Air, Calif., in a house that once belonged to Dean Martin. Mr. Jones's biographer, Colin Macfarlane, described it as "a site that puts even Elvis's Graceland into second place."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Woodward made a rare trip to join her husband last week. She shuns publicity, and as an interview in their Atlantic City hotel suite began, she told her husband that she was going shopping. "You need money, luv?" he said. She showed him a crisp big bill he'd already given her and left.</p>
        <p>At that Mr. Jones leaned forward and narrated the story of how he went for the younger audience.</p>
        <p>In 1987, he was in London promoting a recording of the music from a West End musical (it later failed) when he was asked to appear on "The Last Resort," a late-night talk show much in the spirit of David Letterman, with a young Briton named Jonathon Ross as host. "Jonathon said it wasn't really a plug show and could I do any up-tempo things," Mr. Jones remembered. "He knew that 'Kiss' was in my live show -- I just liked the song -- and asked if I'd fancy doing that."</p>
        <p>The program was seen by J. J. Jeczalik and Anne Dudley from the electronic dance group Art of Noise. They fancied Mr. Jones's rendition and asked him to record it with them. At the time, Mr. Jones hadn't had a hit record in more than a decade and was just concluding a five-record contract that limited him to only country music.</p>
        <p>"Kiss" became a hit in the United States, and the video entered heavy rotation on MTV. But one song wasn't enough to generate serious interest from record companies. Mr. Jones kept up his busy touring schedule and bided his time.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to make records," he said. "New records. I don't want people to say, 'He started to make some noise again and then just faded away.' "</p>
        <p>ON Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Jones showed up a little late for a sound check at Limelight. He hadn't arrived in New York until 5 A.M., his normal bedtime. After his last Atlantic City show, he had taken a limo to visit the New Jersey estate of Burk Zanft, a plastics manufacturer who first met the singer in 1968, when he was performing at the Copacabana, the scene of the first panty toss. In Mr. Jones's casino dressing room the night before, Mr. Zanft had reminisced. "I remember when Tom filled Madison Square Garden," he said. "He was as big as Michael Jackson back then."</p>
        <p>After running through a handful of tunes, Mr. Jones, casually hip in black pants and a houndstooth sport coat, sat amiably through two group photo sessions and one portrait, two television interviews and an assortment of quick questions. After years of selling himself retail in clubs and casino showrooms, the singer seemed calm and happy with some wholesale exposure. Bruce Lynn, the club's frenetic publicist, passed out a news release describing Mr. Jones as a man who had emerged overnight as the "hip-hop father figure for millions of young rockers."</p>
        <p>Neville Wells, the promoter who normally books Tuesday at the Limelight with bands like the Amazing Pink Dots, scurried about in his electric blue Doc Martens and cycle cap saying repeatedly, "He's here because he wanted to play for the kids, the rave people."</p>
        <p>That evening, hundreds of young rockers, and some older fans, showed up. "There's quite of few of the grunge types," said Paul Taylor, the traveling salesman of Tom Jones T-shirts, posters and recordings, who watched a parade of fishnets and chokers and rayon dresses go by his table, a weird contrast to the profusion of pastel pants suits he'd just seen in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>One tall, black-clad woman, Andrea Kapsales, 28, of Manhattan, explained the whole new Tom Jones phenomenon as "a 70's retro thing." Then, she pulled a pair of black panties from her jacket pocket. "I know he doesn't like this anymore," she said. "But who cares. It's part of the ritual."</p>
        <p>A friend, Alison Morley, a 30-year-old Liverpool native, said, "I used to laugh at my mother for listening to Tom Jones, but now I understand why she did."</p>
        <p>Tom Jones took the stage after 11 P.M. By the third tune, panties were raining down on the stage. He ignored them and kept singing, though as the show progressed, his movements became more overtly sexual. With every hip swivel or grab at his crotch, young women screamed.</p>
        <p>But it was the young men Mr. Jones was aiming at. "When you get young guys going," he had said in Atlantic City, clenching his fist and raising it in the air. "You know, when they give you that. Yeah! You say yeah, too."</p>
        <p>By the end of his show, a good number of young men in front were waving their arms at Mr. Jones as if he was a sultan.</p>
        <p>It was after 2 A.M. when Mr. Jones started to settle down, relaxing with a bottle of Champagne at a small party in the Library at the top of Limelight. Some record company people and VH1 executives had stopped by. Some models were scattered about.</p>
        <p>He sat on a couch against the wall, where he was introduced to "the Madonna of Russia," a tall, exotic woman in Michael Jackson-like ersatz military wear. The singer poured her some Champagne and seemed in a bloody good mood as they chatted.</p>
        <p>"Everything is better after I perform," he said. "I would rather perform than not. I don't know what to do with myself. If I go out when I'm on the road, 9 times out of 10 I end up jumping up on stage and singing."</p>
        <p>He got to bed by dawn. When he woke, Tom Jones caught a plane back home to Los Angeles and headed directly to the Greek Theater, where he was going to jump up on stage and sing with his new friend Sting.</p>
