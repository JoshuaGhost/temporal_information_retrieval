        <p>Mayor David N. Dinkins conceded yesterday that he had failed to delay the expected election of Carol A. Gresser today as the new Board of Education president, tacitly acknowledging that he had lost a battle to retain influence over the selection.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Gresser, who has already lined up support from a majority on the board, is chosen today, it will mark the first time in seven years that the board's leader is not a mayoral appointee.</p>
        <p>The Mayor yesterday filled one of his two vacant seats on the board, appointing Dennis M. Walcott, the president of the New York Urban League. But he did not name anyone to fill the other open seat despite earlier speculation that a high-profile appointment might give the Mayor added influence over the selection of the new board president. 'Rushed to Judgment'</p>
        <p>Speaking at a City Hall news conference, Mr. Dinkins said he had sought to delay the scheduled vote until he had filled the two vacancies, but that the board ignored his entreaties, and he made no attempt to hide his irritation.</p>
        <p>"It's unclear why they rushed to judgment," Mr. Dinkins said. "I don't have the capacity to stop it." His aides argued that in light of the board's history of recent wrangling, it would be healthy for the entire seven-member body to be in place so that it could achieve a consensus before selecting a new leader.</p>
        <p>But Michael J. Petrides, a board member, said neither the Mayor nor his staff called anyone at the board directly to request a delay in the vote, and he argued that Mr. Dinkins had waited too long to make his board appointments.</p>
        <p>"The board has a responsibility to have an elected president in place, and we're moving to elect one," Mr. Petrides said. "We thought the Mayor would have picked his appointees by now." He noted that in any event, board bylaws call for new elections for the board presidency in July.</p>
        <p>The vacancies were created by the resignations Mr. Dinkins's two appointees -- the board president, H. Carl McCall, who was chosen last week as State Comptroller, and Dr. Westina L. Matthews, who resigned on April 30 for health reasons. The other five members are appointed by the borough presidents.</p>
        <p>Mayoral aides said last week that in filling the two vacancies, they hoped to select a candidate of such outstanding stature and experience that the person could be chosen as the next president and unify the board -- even though all the borough representatives except for Manhattan's have consistently voted against the Mayor's positions in recent months.</p>
        <p>Among the potential candidates mentioned by Dinkins aides for the other Board of Education seat are Roscoe C. Brown Jr., the president of Bronx Community College, and Stanley Fink, a Manhattan lawyer and former Speaker of the New York State Assembly.</p>
        <p>But the Mayor suggested yesterday that he was having difficulty persuading a preferred candidate to accept the job. Asked yesterday when he planned to name the second appointee, Mr. Dinkins said: "Maybe next week. It's a function really of the ability of the person to say yes."</p>
        <p>Introducing Mr. Walcott to reporters, Mr. Dinkins highlighted qualities that he said suited him well for serving on the board, including master's degrees in education, from the University of Bridgeport, and in social work, from Fordham University, and a professional career that began as a kindergarten teacher in a private Queens school. A Major Strength</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Walcott said another major strength he brings to the school board post was his insight as the father of four school-age children. But unlike Mr. Walcott himself, who attended public elementary and high schools, his children attend a private parochial school, the Allen Christian School in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>The school is associated with the African Methodist Episcopal Church there, led by the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, who is also a Congressman.</p>
        <p>"That should not be interpreted as anti-Board of Ed," Mr. Walcott said. "They'll be going to public high schools."</p>
        <p>Since his appointment as president of the New York Urban League in 1990, Mr. Walcott has worked to foster racial harmony in the city, and especially relations between blacks and Jews.</p>
        <p>Previously, Mr. Walcott had been executive director of the Harlem Dowling-Westside Center for Child and Family Services, a voluntary welfare agency.</p>
        <p>The two mayoral appointees who recently resigned were Manhattan residents. Mr. Walcott, in contrast, was born and raised in Queens and has returned to live in Cambria Heights in that borough.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott's father was an exterminator for the New York City Housing Authority and his mother was a social worker. He attended Public School 36, Junior High School 192 and Francis Lewis High School, all in Queens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walcott said one of the first people to call him to congratulate him on his appointment to the board was Mrs. Gresser, who was appointed by the Queens borough president.</p>
        <p>"She called to congratulate me, and I told her that I looked forward to working with her," Mr. Walcott said. "I would view it as a fellow Queens person working with another."</p>
