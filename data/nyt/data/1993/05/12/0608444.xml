        <p>IN the course of human events, sandwiches have been maligned and exalted, have been delicate contrivances and overstuffed plebian affairs, alternately objects of desire and objects of scorn.</p>
        <p>Either way, summer is high sandwich season. It is the season of hot dogs at the ball park, hamburgers by the backyard grill and French bread, pate and cheese at picnics -- and now, of leaner, post-modern constructions that rely more on roasted or marinated vegetables than meat and that stylishly recycle leftovers like grilled vegetables, lamb, chicken or fish.</p>
        <p>In fact, the nation is in the midst of a sandwich renaissance. There is a new public appetite for restrained rather than overstuffed sandwiches, born of health concerns rather than a fear of splatters and crumbs. Herb pestos, low-fat ricotta spreads and savory marmalades replace mayonnaise, dressings and butter; vegetables and grains supplant lunch meat, and artful salads take the place of the mandatory leaf of iceberg lettuce.</p>
        <p>As recently as 12 years ago, James Beard, in describing his favorite bread construction -- round slices of brioche layered with parsley, onions and mayonnaise -- bridled at the term sandwich. "Sandwiches are so ordinary," he said; he called his invention "onion rounds."</p>
        <p>The fast-food industry was probably a handmaiden to the sandwich's slip in status, and so, of course, was soft white bread, which until recent years reigned supreme in the American home and insured that every sandwich was a soggy sandwich.</p>
        <p>But sandwiches have been creeping back up the social ladder. When Anne Rosenzweig reinvented the hamburger at the "21" Club five years ago, forming a patty around a pat of herb butter that added moisture and flavor, it shattered the proletarian image of the sandwich and paved the way for more imagination and whimsy.</p>
        <p>In the sway of American regional cooking, restaurants along the Eastern Shore of Maryland proudly served crisp soft-shell crabs and lemon mayonnaise on sandwich rolls. Fried clam rolls got fresh herb tartar sauces and renewed cachet among Yankees. In New Orleans, fried oyster poor-boys were no longer simply the province of catering trucks on construction sites. Embellished with jalapeno mayonnaise or mounds of baby greens, they began to be served in fancy restaurants.</p>
        <p>As sandwiches were getting better, a growing attitude of reverse snobbism -- the public doting on low-down chic -- improved the social image of sandwiches.</p>
        <p>After all, in eras of genteel pretense, the fact that a sandwich must be eaten by hand made it suspect and gave rise to foppery like the Victorian era's crustless tea sandwiches, small enough to be consumed in one tidy nibble.</p>
        <p>When politesse is eclipsed by romantic and earthy yearnings, people revel in the primitive satisfaction of hand-held meals, unpredictable crumbs, unruly tomatoes and dressings. Flaunting a disregard for cutlery, the public welcomes overstuffed heroes, club sandwiches and hot dogs dripping mustard and sauerkraut, whose effect on one's blouse or tie eventually pushes the preference back in the direction of delicate sandwiches. Neater sandwiches require a certain restraint in the eating, but they are easier on the wardrobe.</p>
        <p>Though sandwiches satisfy, they are not a commitment to a full meal. They are to be eaten as offhandedly as they are out of the hand, so sandwiches suit the casual nature of summer and its distractions.</p>
        <p>But their character also makes sandwiches vulnerable to being constructed as casually as they are meant to be eaten, which can result in sodden sandwiches or careless combinations in which oily mayonnaise, fatty dressings or butter is used like mortar.</p>
        <p>In fact, bread should be dressed only enough to marry the soft underside of the bread or roll with the sandwich filling. By its flavor, a dressing or spread should complement the filling and subtly enhance the understated flavor of the bread. A soggy sandwich is a sorry affair. It robs the eater of the primal satisfaction of crunching through a crust, as well as the surprising contrast of textures in the fillings beneath the bread cover.</p>
        <p>Sandwich times are good, again. Small focaccia topped with marinated zucchini, French bread stuffed with grilled vegetables and a sun-dried tomato ketchup, pita pockets layered with roasted eggplant and bulgur salad may not be as omnipresent as peanut butter and jelly, but these tasty sandwiches can be found in bakeries and carryout shops from Manhattan to Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The renewed popularity of sandwiches may also be a reaction to the phenomenon of diners sampling from the plates of fellow diners, with each entree considered fair game and each bite requiring comment. Whether lean and stylish or overstuffed, a sandwich will never be taken quite so seriously, and a sandwich remains one's own, to have and to hold.
