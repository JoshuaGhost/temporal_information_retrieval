        <p>It could have been a scene out of "Cheers."</p>
        <p>About two weeks ago, one of the regular patrons at the Larchmont Tavern walked into the men's room and discovered a set of false teeth sitting atop the toilet tank. After the owner of the teeth failed to come forward, Anthony Flook, one of the Tavern's bartenders, decided to have a little fun: he put the dentures in a glass of vodka and offered $100 to anyone who could drink it to the bottom. No one took the dare.</p>

        <p>It could have been a scene out of "Cheers."</p>
        <p>About two weeks ago, one of the regular patrons at the Larchmont Tavern walked into the men's room and discovered a set of false teeth sitting atop the toilet tank. After the owner of the teeth failed to come forward, Anthony Flook, one of the Tavern's bartenders, decided to have a little fun: he put the dentures in a glass of vodka and offered $100 to anyone who could drink it to the bottom. No one took the dare.</p>
        <p>Spend a few hours at the Tavern, a wood-paneled former speak-easy that has been a cozy fixture in this coastal village since the 1930's, and it's not hard to discover why so many Americans have electronically walked through the front door of "Cheers" every week for 11 years. Indeed, some who congregate at the Tavern see "Cheers" less as a work of fiction than as a mirror of their own lives. 'Not Just Television'</p>
        <p>"It's real," said Mr. Flook, 26, drawing a beer from a tap behind the Tavern's varnished oak countertop. "There have been times when a guy says, 'If my wife calls, I'm not here.' It really happens. It's not just television."</p>
        <p>As the cast of regulars at the Tavern gathered tonight to watch and toast the final episode of their favorite show, the parallels between this Westchester bar and its make-believe counterpart in Boston seemed numerous. Just like "Cheers," the Tavern is frequented by a postal worker, although he's retired and his name is Ray, not Cliff.</p>
        <p>And just like his favorite "Cheers" character -- the lovably philandering bartender Sam Malone -- Mr. Flook dotes on his full head of light-brown hair, loves sports and has been known to date a customer every now and then. In fact, he met his current girlfriend right here in the bar. Sammy would be proud.</p>
        <p>And then there's Norm. Everybody here seems to think they've got something in common with Norm Peterson, the affable, overweight cynic who always seems to be guzzling beer and never seems to leave.</p>
        <p>"I'm Norm," said Julie Stone, 27, as she sipped a glass of white wine.  "Because I come here a lot. And because everyone knows my name." Photographs and Memories</p>
        <p>Kevin Skinner, a part-owner of the Tavern, disagreed, saying he casts his "Norm" vote for Paul Cunningham, one of his partners.</p>
        <p>"He sits at the end of the bar and he's immobile," Mr. Skinner said. "He's the same size. And he'll be working on two bar stools soon."</p>
        <p>Everything about the dimly lit Tavern exudes warmth, which is why so many of the regulars seem to spend so much time there, kibitzing, and to be honest, drinking a fair amount.</p>
        <p>The actual bar consists of two worn oak planks suspended over a footrail that is an old iron pipe. The walls are covered with dozens of framed, yellowing photographs, including snapshots of long-retired players from the Yankees and Giants, as well as those from nearby Mamaroneck High School.</p>
        <p>There are photographs of a few celebrities too, including the actors Matt Dillon, who grew up in the area and who sometimes stop by, and Larry Hagman, who "had lunch here in 6/86," according to a note scribbled near his autograph.</p>
        <p>The usual patrons, however, are more likely to include stockbrokers, accountants and other business people, as well as a classical pianist who occasionally bursts into operatic song, a pilot for a major airline and a Scottish nanny who is a "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of Fortune" fanatic.</p>
        <p>"A guy making $1 million a year will sit down and have a one-hour conversation with a guy making $15,000 a year," said Doug Doherty, 31, a carpenter from New Rochelle, who estimated he visited the Tavern about four times a week.</p>
        <p>With clients ranging in age from their 20's to their 70's, it is up to the bartenders -- including Skip Decker, who works the day shift and Steven Augustine, who alternates nights with Mr. Flook -- to hold things together. And by all accounts they do.</p>
        <p>"There are some people I would consider very close," Mr. Flook said, "meaning there's not anything I wouldn't do for them."</p>
        <p>Chris Bach, 28, agreed, saying that when he needs a shoulder to lean on, he can always find it at the Tavern.</p>
        <p>"When I fight with her," he said, gesturing toward his girlfriend, Berit Hessen, "I come to see him," he added, pointing to Mr. Flook.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the Tavern was completely taken over by "Cheers" hoopla, with several patrons playing a "Cheers" board game before the series finale began and later singing along with the theme song.</p>
        <p>And even though the show will live on in the spirit of bars like the Tavern and in reruns, Tom Eberlein, 31, said he would mourn the passing of "Cheers," which he has watched since it began during his first year of college.</p>
        <p>"It's the end of an era," said Mr. Eberlein, who sells French bread and croissants for the company Vie de France. "No Republicans in the White House and 'Cheers' is ending."</p>
        <p>"I'm going to move to Canada," he said.</p>
