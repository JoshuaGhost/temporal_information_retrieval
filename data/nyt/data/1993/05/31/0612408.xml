        <p>The authorities are quietly investigating a major medical scandal involving a rural factory that washed more than one million used disposable hypodermic needles and then sold them as new.</p>
        <p>The Government is desperately trying to keep the matter quiet, but internal documents indicate that since 1988 the factory has supplied hospitals with contaminated needles that were never sterilized. Two dozen peasants simply washed the hypodermics under a hand pump, laid them outside to dry and then sealed them in plastic bags with Red Cross Blood Center labels.</p>
        <p>"Throughout this period, hundreds of thousands of blood donors and recipients in Beijing -- including state and party leaders -- have been threatened with infection," a recent internal Government report declared. "Those who should save lives became murderers, all for the sake of cash."</p>
        <p>The episode offers a window into the challenges that a developing country faces on the way to a market economy. All of a sudden, money matters more than ever before in China, and both institutions and individuals are cutting corners to become wealthy. 4 Deaths in January Reported</p>
        <p>According to a doctor briefed on the inquiry, four patients at Youan Hospital here died in January after receiving blood products from contaminated needles. Partly out of a fear of leaks, officials have not tried to find out how many patients may have been affected.</p>
        <p>Although the matter has gone all the way to the Politburo, the authorities appear to have devoted as much effort to hushing up the scandal as to uncovering it. Information about the case has been tightly restricted, and the few Chinese reporters who learned about the scandal have been barred from writing a word about it.</p>
        <p>At this period in its economic transition, when China is at the hazy conjunction of market and Marxism, Chinese are rushing to take advantage of quasi-capitalist ventures, but the regulatory institutions that gradually developed in the West are not yet established here.</p>
        <p>Officials initially declined to comment, although some indirectly confirmed that the events described in the document had taken place. Beijing Hospital said it had written a report on the case, but denied that its doctors had used contaminated needles. City Official Denies Risk</p>
        <p>At Youan Hospital, an official who gave only her surname, Zheng, said, "We have decided that the City Health Department will handle everything on this case."</p>
        <p>At the department, officials could be overheard anxiously consulting before one said that no one present could discuss the matter. Several days later, the department called back in alarm after several hospitals said a reporter had been asking about the matter.</p>
        <p>Lu Peng, a department official, acknowledged that there had been problems with the rural factory as a source of hypodermics, but he asserted that there had never been a risk to blood donors or recipients.</p>
        <p>"We've always been extremely strict in our blood program," Mr. Lu said. "All of the paraphernalia must undergo strict sterilization."</p>
        <p>Mr. Lu hinted that the internal document was inaccurate, but when pressed on a specific point, he repeated that the authorities were investigating details but that the department had always been concerned with safety. A Courtyard Factory</p>
        <p>The problems began when the Beijing Red Cross Blood Center, which supplies hospitals with hypodermics, contracted in 1988 to make disposable needles in collaboration with an entrepreneur in nearby Hebei Province. According to the document, the Blood Center lent its name to the venture and purchased the products but provided no supervision. The center is independent of the International Committee of the Red Cross, based in Geneva.</p>
        <p>The document says the entrepreneur, Liu Hansheng, turned his home courtyard into a small factory. He hired peasants to wash the disposable hypodermics, apparently gathered from hospitals, and seal them in plastic with the name of the Red Cross Blood Center. The packaging was the most sophisticated part of his operation.</p>
        <p>The needles were then shipped to scores of hospitals in China, including those that specialize in serving foreigners. Traces of dried blood could occasionally be seen on the hypodermics, but in most cases doctors apparently did not examine the needles closely and were unaware that they had been used.</p>
        <p>The authorities received a complaint from a peasant in March and closed down the factory, confiscating 250,000 hypodermics. The document says Mr. Liu admitted to having sold more than one million repackaged needles. Mr. Liu was one of several suppliers, and among those needles that he sold, not all were contaminated.  Health Care Is Praised</p>
        <p>For all of these problems, many experts say that China on the whole has an excellent health care system for a developing country. The reuse of disposable needles is a problem elsewhere in China and in other developing countries, and disposables are being developed so they cannot be reused.</p>
        <p>This month, an official in the Beijing Health Bureau met with Chinese reporters and suggested that while some disposable hypodermics were reused, they had been sterilized first. But a transcript of the session indicates that he dodged specific questions about how they could have been sterilized.</p>
        <p>The doctor familiar with the case says they were not sterilized, because the authorities never bothered to check that rules were enforced. The doctor said physicians noted a high proportion of infection and complications after surgery and transfusions, but did not know the reason.</p>
        <p>The document says one study in Hebei Province found that 80 percent of those using the needles could be infected, but that another indicated that at a Beijing hospital with better conditions, 20 percent faced infection.</p>
        <p>China says it has discovered 969 people with the AIDS virus, out of a population of nearly 1.2 billion, so health officials say that infection with AIDS is not considered a major danger. A far greater concern is infection with Hepatitis B, which is carried by about 10 percent of the population and can cause liver damage and even death.</p>
        <p>An investigation is continuing, but no one has been punished in the case.</p>
