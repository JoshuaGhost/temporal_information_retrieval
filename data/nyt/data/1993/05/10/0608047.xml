        <p>One of the founding fathers of the shareholder rights movement has found a new target: shareholders, or at least the class of big holders known as institutional investors.</p>
        <p>Ira M. Millstein, founder of the Institutional Investor Project at Columbia University and a New York attorney, said his project, which helped begin the shareholder rights movement that has shaken up Corporate America, would now examine the ethics and policies of major institutional shareholders -- corporate and public pension funds, bank trust departments, insurance companies and mutual funds. Growing Power</p>
        <p>Collectively, this group owns about $3 trillion worth of American stocks, or more than 50 percent of all the shares of the nation's publicly held corporations. Institutional investors' financial power has been steadily growing as stock holdings by individual investors continue to decline and pension funds have replaced individuals as the biggest buyers of corporate stocks.</p>

        <p>One of the founding fathers of the shareholder rights movement has found a new target: shareholders, or at least the class of big holders known as institutional investors.</p>
        <p>Ira M. Millstein, founder of the Institutional Investor Project at Columbia University and a New York attorney, said his project, which helped begin the shareholder rights movement that has shaken up Corporate America, would now examine the ethics and policies of major institutional shareholders -- corporate and public pension funds, bank trust departments, insurance companies and mutual funds. Growing Power</p>
        <p>Collectively, this group owns about $3 trillion worth of American stocks, or more than 50 percent of all the shares of the nation's publicly held corporations. Institutional investors' financial power has been steadily growing as stock holdings by individual investors continue to decline and pension funds have replaced individuals as the biggest buyers of corporate stocks.</p>
        <p>But only a handful of these large investors -- a small number of public funds that represent state and municipal employees and teachers -- have asserted their rights as corporate owners and demanded a larger say in board room matters. In recent months, their pressure has helped oust top executives at General Motors, I.B.M. and Westinghouse Electric and has brought more outside directors to corporate boards.</p>
        <p>These institutions have also raised questions about high executive compensation at underperforming companies. Yet, as this effort unfolded, the majority of institutional investors remained on the sidelines. And some even opposed the movement.</p>
        <p>"For years, we have been studying boards and managers," said Mr. Millstein, a partner at the law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, at a New York conference last week sponsored by the Columbia project. "Now it is time for the shareholders and institutions to be studied. We know little or nothing about how these major investor types exercise their shareholding responsibilities. To whom are these financial institutions accountable? Who is watching the watchers? Anyone?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Millstein's remarks were praised by many of the shareholder advocates attending the conference, who say they are tiring of leading the charge alone.</p>
        <p>"His ideas are excellent," said Dale Hanson, chief executive of the California Public Employees Retirement System, which has $73 billion in investments and is the nation's largest and most active pension fund.</p>
        <p>The California fund, known as Calpers, owns stock in more than a thousand companies. It has so much money to invest that as a practical matter it cannot quickly sell its shares in underperforming companies. In most companies, Calpers owns so many shares that a selloff could cause the stock to crater. 'What Does It Take?'</p>
        <p>"I don't see the corporate funds involved in any way," Mr. Hanson said. "You can count on your fingers and toes who are active shareholders, and not one is a corporate fund. What does it take to get them to become more active? Look at A.T.&amp; T.. Their pension fund holds more than 2,000 stocks and they have shown no interest in corporate governance."</p>
        <p>Shareholder activists say that corporate pension funds have avoided involvement in issues of corporate governance because they do not want to be seen as attacking fellow corporations. Insurance companies, meanwhile, have shown no interest in shareholder aadvocacy. And mutual funds generally invest mainly for the short term and, as a result, are less interested in long-term oversight of corporate performance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Millstein said his project would examine how institutional shareholders could pick corporate directors and might guide corporations to improve their performance. He said the project would also examine "hidden agendas" at pension funds -- specifically, political influences at public funds and the "eyes of corporate managers" at private funds.</p>
        <p>"Are mutual funds so subject to competitive pressures that their main concern must be short-term performances with little regard to providing patient capital?" Mr. Millstein asked. "Are the banks willing to risk offending corporate clients by becoming too involved in corporate affairs? And why don't we hear more from the insurance companies?"</p>
        <p>Michael C. Jensen, a Harvard finance professor attending the conference, questioned Mr. Millstein's effort and said he believed it would cause pension funds to run afoul of insider-trading restrictions. 'You've Got to Be There'</p>
        <p>"If you get Fidelity and Prudential involved in a long-term relationship, you have an implication of continued trust," said Mr. Jensen, who became famous in the 1980's for his staunch defense of hostile takeovers. "None of these funds can trade in stocks of companies in which they are stuck with knowing insider information. But to prevent the G.M.'s and I.B.M.'s of the future, you've got to be there when the critical decisions are made."</p>
        <p>Mr. Jensen's fears were quickly countered by others at the conference. John Pound, a Harvard professor, said the problem of potential inside information can be handled by creating a wall within pension funds, in the same way that investment banks erect internal walls to keep inside information gained from corporate finance clients from their own traders.</p>
        <p>"I think it's a great idea to focus on institutional shareholders and help them become better corporate monitors," Mr. Pound said. "It should not be that everyone will be doing the same thing, but that a variety of different participants will do different things."</p>
