        <p>Shoppers cut back on visits to stores in April, depressing sales growth for most retailers. Industry analysts attributed the cutbacks by consumers to everything from lower tax refunds to dread about costs for a national health care program.</p>
        <p>Whatever the cause, the tepid sales of spring merchandise reported by most major retailers yesterday are likely to translate into higher than expected markdowns.  Slow Second Quarter Seen</p>
        <p>That will erode second-quarter profits somewhat, analysts said, although most retailers have kept a tight grip on inventories. The Kmart Corporation and the Dayton Hudson Corporation have already warned Wall Street that their first-quarter performance, the results of which will be released in the next two weeks, will not match last year's results.</p>
        <p>And the slow progress of the health care package being cobbled together in Washington should continue to keep a lid on sales, analysts said.</p>
        <p>"Every month the potential bill for health care increases by another $50 billion," said Walter F. Loeb, president of Loeb Associates Inc., a retail consulting firm. "No one wants to go out and buy anything until they know how big a bite it's going to take out of their pockets."</p>
        <p>Margo McGlade, a retail analyst at Paine Webber, said the generally lower tax refunds and higher tax payments this year caused by the lower withholding rates in 1992 also had an impact on people's budgets. "If you had to write a check to the I.R.S., even if it's just a $200 check, that's $200 you didn't spend," she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGlade said that sales momentum should pick up in May and June, if only because cool weather in those months last year dampened spending, so sales should increase by comparison.</p>
        <p>The Salomon Brothers Same-Store Sales Growth Index, which is a weighted average of comparable store sales for 22 major retailers, rose 2.6 percent in April. That's equivalent to the 2.5 percent logged in the same period last year, a poor year for retailers.</p>
        <p>Only a few retailers outdid that average. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the $55 billion retail chain that tends to set the sales pace each month, said its sales in stores open at least one year rose 6 percent in April.</p>
        <p>The increase by Wal-Mart increase was stronger than most of its competitors' but not as vigorous compared with its own past results. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company's comparable store sales also climbed 5 percent, and same-store sales at J. C. Penney department stores increased 4 percent.</p>
        <p>Those chains outdid most others. Specialty stores selling apparel were among the hardest hit, as cooler weather continued to inhibit sales of items like shorts, sleeveless blouses and sandals.</p>
        <p>Gap Inc. said its comparable store sales increased just 2 percent in the four weeks that ended May 1. And the Limited Inc.'s sales in stores open at least one year were flat.</p>
        <p>Several retailers said commodity products like consumer electronics, light bulbs and appliances sold better than apparel. Circuit City Stores and Best Buys, the dueling consumer electronics chains, had strong comparable store increases of 9 and 16 percent, respectively.</p>
        <p>The Kmart chairman and chief executive, Joseph E. Antonini, said that his company's sales of hard goods had met expectations, but that demand for clothing was weak, except in the South. Comparable store sales in Kmart discount stores and the company's specialty stores, which include Sports Authority and Waldenbooks, rose only 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Retail companies with a presence in California, particularly Southern California, endured an even more noticeable sales downturn. The Dayton Hudson Corporation, whose Mervyn's and Target chains have a large number of stores in California, said same-store sales slipped 2 percent in April.</p>
