        <p>One of the horse-racing advisers to the Governor said yesterday that the state should lower its taxes on bets as part of an overhaul of the parimutuel system "to revive the state's racing, wagering and breeding indutries."</p>
        <p>The proposal was made in a report by Steven Crist, the racing writer, who was one of nine people named last year to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Advisory Commission on Racing in the 21st Century. The commission is expected to send its recommendations to Cuomo early in June. It has already indicated that it favors some sort of merger of the New York Racing Association and the Off-Track Betting Corporation.</p>

        <p>One of the horse-racing advisers to the Governor said yesterday that the state should lower its taxes on bets as part of an overhaul of the parimutuel system "to revive the state's racing, wagering and breeding indutries."</p>
        <p>The proposal was made in a report by Steven Crist, the racing writer, who was one of nine people named last year to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Advisory Commission on Racing in the 21st Century. The commission is expected to send its recommendations to Cuomo early in June. It has already indicated that it favors some sort of merger of the New York Racing Association and the Off-Track Betting Corporation.</p>
        <p>In a briefing at Belmont Park yesterday on the economics of betting in the state, Crist said that he was proposing reforms in four areas: a cut in the parimutuel tax, or takeout, on each bet; a new allocation of the money taken out of bets, both on and off the track, returning more to the bettor; a change in the formula for "breakage," or rounding off the money paid out in bets, and eliminating or refining the state's withholding of income taxes from high, winning bets.</p>
        <p>"The only way to bring in more revenue to both government and racing," Crist said, "is to increase the parimutuel handle wagered by the public, whose bets provide every last nickel of funding for these industries."</p>
        <p>His key proposal would lower the tax on bets in order to return more to the bettor, who would presumably promptly put it back into the system in new bets. When the parimutuel system began in New York in 1940, the takeout was 10 percent, with 90 percent returned to the bettor. The tax today ranges from 17 percent for straight bets to 25 percent for more exotic bets, and the state's six regional OTB corporations impose an additional surcharge of up to 6 percent on winning bets.</p>
        <p>The money subtracted from each winning bet at the track is now split this way: 8.5 percent to the racing association, 4.5 percent to the state, 3.5 percent to purses.</p>
        <p>"If you bet $100 on racing," Crist said, "you pay $18 as the cost. On a football game, you pay $4.50. I am suggesting a cut of 15 to 20 percent in the takeout on racing bets. If the state has to take a hit to save the industry, it will have to take it. But the state shouldn't take all the burden. In the long run, everybody should gain. Every time the takeout goes down, attendance and handle go up. It's that simple."</p>
        <p>Gerard J. McKeon, president of the N.Y.R.A., who attended the briefing, said he agreed in principle, and added: "I don't see many alternatives." Fly So Free Wins</p>
        <p>Tommy Valando's Fly So Free gave a stirring performance when he rocketed seven furlongs in 1:21 flat and won the feature race at Belmont yesterday by three and a quarter lengths over Magesterian.</p>
        <p>The 1990 juvenile champion, now 5 years old, took charge at the head of the stretch, powered into the clear under a precise ride by Julie Krone and came within three-fifths of a second of the track record.</p>
        <p>Scotty Schulhofer, who trains the chestnut son of Time for a Change, said later that the Metropolitan Mile on May 31 was next, and added: "He ran a powerful race. I'm not concerned about Alydeed or anybody else. This was meant to get him ready, and he's ready." Rockamundo in the Preakness</p>
        <p>Rockamundo will try to beat the odds by running in the Preakness a week from tomorrow, less than two weeks after corrective surgery to repair a breathing problem. The colt, who won the Arkansas Derby at 108-1, ran 17th in the Kentucky Derby and then underwent minor surgery at Churchill Downs this week to correct a displaced soft palate.</p>
        <p>"A horse can be back in training in three days," his trainer, Ben Glass Jr., said. "If everything looks good, he'll run in the Preakness." Acorn at Belmont</p>
        <p>Next marquee event at Belmont: the Acorn, first race in the Triple Tiara series for fillies. It'll be run tomorrow, with Georgia Hoffman's Sky Beauty and Ogden Mills Phipps's Educated Risk heading a tight field of six. The distance is one mile, and the purse $150,000.</p>
