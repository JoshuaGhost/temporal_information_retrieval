        <p>You write in "Bagels Are Now Fast Food, and Purists Do a Slow Boil" (news article, April 25): "It's believed that bagels were invented by a Jewish baker in Vienna in 1683. To thank King John III Sobieski of Poland for saving the city from Turkish invaders, the anonymous baker crafted a hard roll in the shape of a riding stirrup, in honor of the king's favorite hobby. The bread's original name was 'bugel,' from the German for stirrup."</p>
        <p>It's high time that that piece of fakelore be laid to rest. The earliest known use of the Yiddish word "beygl" is in the communal rules that the leaders of the Jewish community of Cracow promulgated in 1610. The rules stipulate that bagels are among the gifts which may be given to women in childbirth and to midwives.</p>
        <p>The word was thus being used at least 73 years before John III Sobieski defeated the Turks. The bagel, in fact, is even older.</p>
        <p>When a word or expression is new or thought to be little known, it is often defined (The New York Times of Feb. 4, 1956, speaks of "the bagel, a form of Jewish baked goods sometimes described as a doughnut with rigor mortis"), yet the communal rules of 1610 contain no definition or explanation.</p>
        <p>Hence it is clear that the word beygl was well established in Cracow Yiddish of the early 17th century. Indeed, since those rules allude to earlier communal rules about bagels, we may be certain that this bread is even older.</p>
        <p>We do not know when and where the bagel was invented nor whether its inventor was a Jew or a German. Contrary to popular opinion, Yiddish beygl is not derived from German bugel, although the two words are distant cousins. DAVID L.
