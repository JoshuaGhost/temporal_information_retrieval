        <p>RUSTY WALLACE, injured in a spectacular stock car crash on Sunday, went from one hospital to another yesterday in an effort to make certain he will be ready to race in less than two weeks. The 36-year-old Wallace was released yesterday morning from Carraway Medical Center in Birmingham, Ala., and immediately flew to Indianapolis for an examination by Dr. TERRY TRAMMELL, an orthopedic specialist.</p>
        <p>Wallace, who came away from a crash in Sunday's Winston 500 at Talladega, Ala., with a broken left wrist and a concussion, was admitted by Trammell to Methodist Hospital, where he inserted a steel pin lengthwise through the broken wrist. "He should be able to use the wrist effectively within a week and will be able to take a test drive shortly thereafter," Trammell said. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: AUTO RACING</p>
