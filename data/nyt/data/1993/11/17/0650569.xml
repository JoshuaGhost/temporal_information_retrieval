        <p>Ms. Porizkova, 28, and Mr. Ocasek, 44, met in 1984 when she starred in the band's "Drive" music video. They have been married since 1989.</p>
        <p>Ms. Porizkova, who was born in the former Czechoslovakia, has been a model for Estee Lauder cosmetics and has appeared in Sports Illustrated magazine's annual swimsuit issues.</p>
        <p>She is also the co-author of a children's book, "The Adventures of Ralphie the Roach," which was published last year by Doubleday. So she has at least one well-rehearsed bedtime story ready.</p>
