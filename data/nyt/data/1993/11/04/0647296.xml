        <p>Last week, after seven months on the job, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., issued an assessment along with the company's financial results for the third quarter. "I am confident I.B.M. is on the right track," he declared.</p>

        <p>Last week, after seven months on the job, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chairman of I.B.M., issued an assessment along with the company's financial results for the third quarter. "I am confident I.B.M. is on the right track," he declared.</p>
        <p>Many investors apparently share that confidence, bidding up the price of the International Business Machines Corporation's shares by 13 percent, to $50.75, since the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss last week. On Tuesday, the stock jumped $3, after a longtime critic of I.B.M., Thomas T. Rooney, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, upgraded his rating to "very attractive" from his previous "neutral" designation.</p>
        <p>But newfound investor confidence does not change many experts' view that the "track" Mr. Gerstner has chosen for I.B.M. may be the riskiest of gambles, no less nervy despite there seeming to be nothing radical about it. For Mr. Gerstner is attempting to revive the troubled computer company not through radical changes but mainly by running it better -- smarter management and more cost cutting.</p>
        <p>It may seem a conservative approach. But given the company's straits, there is no course of caution anymore at I.B.M.</p>
        <p>"There's a real risk that the bottom falls out at I.B.M. over the next year or two," said Steven M. Milunovich of Morgan Stanley &amp; Company. Mr. Milunovich is hardly some alarmist on the fringe of the investment community; he has been the top-ranked large-computer analyst in Institutional Investor magazine's annual survey for the last five years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milunovich is not predicting catastrophe for Big Blue. But he does say that the dangers I.B.M. faces outweigh the chances of a robust recovery anytime soon. The "real risk" he mentions is that the company's revenues could slide as I.B.M. proves unable to replace its eroding mainframe and minicomputer business with new sources of growth.</p>
        <p>In short, anyone who thinks that because the company's stock price is still about half the $100-a-share level it reached during the summer of 1992, I.B.M. now has only "upside potential," in Wall Street parlance, should think again.</p>
        <p>The Gerstner game plan is a wholehearted embrace of the most fashionable trend in American management, known as "re-engineering." It means looking at a company's business processes -- in marketing, manufacturing, product development and so on -- and overhauling them top-to-bottom for speed, efficiency and customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p>A big-company enthusiast, Mr. Gerstner has said he plans to hold the company together, still offering a smorgasbord of computer wares, from mainframes to microchips, software to consultant services. The result, he hopes, will be synergy, growth and profits. He is making an across-the-board bet on I.B.M.'s future rather than putting all his chips on a few key products, technologies or markets. In effect, Mr. Gerstner is re-engineering I.B.M., but not reinventing it. Doubts on Cost Cutting</p>
        <p>And Mr. Milunovich, among others, has doubts that cost-cutting and re-engineering will be enough to turn I.B.M. around. "The company has to stop trying to be all things to all people," the Morgan Stanley analyst said. "It has to make big bets."</p>
        <p>The Intel Corporation is the classic case of the big-bet formula for recovery in a fast-moving high-technology business. In 1986, Intel was in trouble, losing money and making commodity memory chips. It abandoned that business and bet its future on the microprocessor, the computer-on-a-chip that serves as the "brain" of personal computers. That bet, of course, has paid off handsomely, making Intel the world's leading semiconductor producer.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. has a microprocessor-based bet of its own in the works. Called Power PC, it is a family of chips, made in an alliance with Motorola Inc. and Apple Computer Inc., that will span the computer industry, for use in everything from hand-held devices to the replacements for mainframes. The first Power PC chip, the 601, went on sale in September. Assault on Intel</p>
        <p>Over the next two years or so, I.B.M. plans to have machines including personal computers, minicomputers and mainframes that run on the new chips. The Power PC chips are a direct assault on Intel's control of the dominant hardware standard in the industry -- a good bet, analysts say, but also one that promises to be lengthy and costly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gerstner's streamlining and re-engineering drive, intended to trim I.B.M.'s expenses by $7 billion by mid-1996, is an effort to buy time and generate cash, allowing the company to make the transition to a new technology. I.B.M. may succeed, as investors seem to be betting recently, but it promises to be an arduous, bumpy journey.</p>
        <p>The key questions involve how quickly the old technology world is declining and whether I.B.M. is moving quickly enough to the new one. Charles H. Ferguson and Charles R. Morris, two consultants working on a report for institutional investors entitled "The Coming Crisis at I.B.M.," argue that the company is not moving aggressively enough to the industry's new model of computing, which involves low-cost, microprocessor-based machines that are linked in networks and run on industry-standard software. This approach is known as client-server computing.</p>
        <p>Recognizing the trend, I.B.M. has tried to recast its mainframes and minicomputers as "servers," or data warehouses. But the two consultants estimate that I.B.M. machines represent only 10 to 15 percent of the 300,000 computers sold a year as the data hubs in client-server networks. "I.B.M. is rapidly losing its power to set industry standards in corporate computing," said Mr. Ferguson, a consultant in Cambridge, Mass. Leadership Is Questioned</p>
        <p>Some big customers have concluded that I.B.M. has already lost its position as the technological leader in computing. In a September survey of some 50 information services executives at major corporations, Morgan Stanley asked whether they view I.B.M. as a "leader in setting industry direction." Sixty-eight percent replied, "No," while 32 percent said, "Yes."</p>
        <p>Clearly, I.B.M. is making an all-out effort to hold onto its current customers. In New York, for example, I.B.M. has worked closely with the H. L. Wilson Company, a 500-employee data warehouse, which publishes and distributes products like the "Guide to Periodical Literature" to research libraries. Wilson has an I.B.M. mainframe, and in the past it operated in the old way, handling big batches of work laboriously summoned by small numbers of employees working on "dumb" terminals. But I.B.M.'s development staff has worked with the Bronx company to transform its mainframe into a "server" surrounded by a networks of personal computers, enabling Wilson employees to work continuously on the reference works and turn them out faster. 'Really Worked With Us'</p>
        <p>"I.B.M. has really worked with us to make the changes we wanted," said Lucian Parziale, Wilson's chief information officer. "If they don't, they'll lose customers."</p>
        <p>Michael Wojtukiewicz, the director of systems development at Wilson, suggests another force that may well work to I.B.M.'s advantage, slowing the migration of customers to other technologies. "A lot of small shops don't really have the luxury of switching to another platform any time soon," he said. "Big companies can do that. We can't."</p>
        <p>Still, I.B.M. must push its transition to low-cost, microprocessor-based corporate computing hard and fast, because more and more customers are no longer waiting for Big Blue to lead the way.</p>
