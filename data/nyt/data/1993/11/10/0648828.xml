        <p>THE place: Waterbury, Conn. The time: Next to the last banking day before Halloween. The sign, spotted by Jack Manning, is posted in the lobby of the Bank of Boston, Connecticut branch, at Colonial Plaza:</p>
        <p>WE WILL BE UNABLE</p>
        <p>TO TRANSACT BUSINESS</p>
        <p>FOR ANY CUSTOMER</p>
        <p>WEARING A MASK</p>
        <p>OR FACIAL DISGUISE</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Halloween in Connecticut, continued:</p>
        <p>During a parade at Toquam Elementary School in Stamford, Christie Fountain chanced upon this innocent comment on violence and small children.</p>
        <p>A kindergartner hid behind her teacher as a fifth grader marched by, draped in black and sporting a ghoulish red rubber mask.</p>
        <p>"I'm afraid of that costume!" the youngster wailed.</p>
        <p>"Oh, don't be afraid of him," the teacher said. "It's only David Stein."</p>
        <p>The little girl peeked out from her hiding place. "I haven't seen that movie," she said.</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Noon. In the semidarkness of the Murray Hill theater on East 34th Street, Marcella Waldman waits for "Son of the Pink Panther" to start. Two women enter and look around at the empty theater.</p>
        <p>"I guess the next showing gets a bigger crowd," one says hopefully.</p>
        <p>"No," Ms. Waldman replies. "This picture is a flop. I'm just killing time while my apartment is being cleaned."</p>
        <p>"Oh?" The tone of the third woman's voice chills the theater. "I can't wait to see it. My daughter and son-in-law wrote the script with Blake Edwards."</p>
        <p>Just then the lights go out and the picture begins. And not a moment too soon.</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>NOVEMBER November, that old crone, with eyes bleak as milk,  squats on the cracked ground and picks at her tatters,  Scatters of dust curls and dead leaves.  She barks her hoarse cough to the demented wind,  Shrieking and keening, careening the sodden clouds.  With thin fingers she scratches the trees.  Etching frail filigree of branch and twig,  Frost-lacquered and stiff, nervously scraping the sky. MARJORIE K. BERNSTEIN</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Strolling through Central Park, I overheard a fragment of conversation between a young couple heading toward Tavern on the Green.</p>
        <p>She to him: "How could he live without me? How could anyone live without me?"</p>
        <p>Fortunately, it was at that point our routes diverged. MICHAEL RONALL</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Another autumn afternoon in Manhattan finds Norman Berg heading downtown on a Fifth Avenue bus. Somewhere in midtown, a woman of a certain age climbs aboard. She is wearing an attention-getting straw hat with a large red ribbon that matches her red tennis shoes. She immediately becomes chatty with her fellow passengers.</p>
        <p>Several stops later, a serious-looking fellow gets on. He wears boots, faded blue jeans and a smashing cowboy hat.</p>
        <p>"Are you a cowboy?" the woman in the hat wants to know. "Where are you from?" she persists. No answer. Long pause. Finally he stares down at her.</p>
        <p>"Madame," he says, "I'm from 57th and Park." He strides down the aisle to a vacant seat.</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>The flight was from Milan, Italy, to New York; the movie shown was "Indecent Proposal," starring Robert Redford. The after-the-film dialogue between passengers included this across-the-aisle query from one silver-haired woman to another.</p>
        <p>"So tell me. Would you have done it?"</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Wright O'Connor of Mount Laurel, N.J., is a volunteer in a night class for adults. The students, whose native languages include Polish, Spanish, Arabic and Urdu, are learning English as a second language.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Connor was helping Nela, a recent emigre from sultry Pakistan; she was showing her illustrations from a child's dictionary that matched "A," "B," "C "with "Apple," "Baby," "Cat," etc.</p>
        <p>The "E" showed a pair of big, furry earmuffs. Nela hesitated, frowned, thought hard. Finally, with raised eyebrows, she ventured an answer.</p>
        <p>"Walkman?" she asked.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Connor patted her pupil's hand and assured her she was learning about America fast.</p>
