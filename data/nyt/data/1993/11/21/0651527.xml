        <p>A Federal appeals court ruling last week reinforced doubts about President Clinton's new policy on homosexuals in the military.</p>
        <p>The policy, a product of months of tense negotiations between the White House, the military and Congress, struck a compromise between the half-century-old ban on homosexuals and Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign pledge to eliminate it.

        <p>A Federal appeals court ruling last week reinforced doubts about President Clinton's new policy on homosexuals in the military.</p>
        <p>The policy, a product of months of tense negotiations between the White House, the military and Congress, struck a compromise between the half-century-old ban on homosexuals and Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign pledge to eliminate it. Under new regulations that are being drafted, the military would permit homosexuals to serve so long as they remain silent about their sexual orientation and do not engage in homosexual acts.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled unanimously that the old policy was based on prejudice and therefore violated the Fifth Amendment's equal-protection guarantee. While the judges said that they were not passing judgment on the new policy, they said the Government could not remove members of the armed services simply because they say they are homosexuals. That is precisely what the new policy, like the old one, would permit the military to do.</p>
        <p>The judges ordered the Naval Academy in Annapolis to award a diploma to Joseph C. Steffan and the Navy to commission him as an officer. A midshipman at the top of his class, Mr. Steffan was forced to resign six weeks before his graduation in 1987 after acknowledging during an investigation that he was gay.</p>
        <p>Although the decision was the highest-level court ruling since the furor began, it was not the first; there have been four lower-level rulings against the ban this year. And it was hardly the last word. Ultimately, the constitutionality of the new policy is likely be decided by the Supreme Court, which has long tended to defer to the White House's judgment on military matters. STEPHEN LABATON</p>
