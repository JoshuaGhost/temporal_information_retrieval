        <p>IT takes confidence to lend to a company with dubious credit on terms that forgo receiving any interest for many years.</p>
        <p>That investors have confidence can be seen from the strength of underwriting business for zero-coupon bonds, which pay no cash interest but instead are worth more at maturity, that are rated below investment grade. If the company goes under in a few years, the bond holder could wind up with nothing to show for the investment.</p>

        <p>IT takes confidence to lend to a company with dubious credit on terms that forgo receiving any interest for many years.</p>
        <p>That investors have confidence can be seen from the strength of underwriting business for zero-coupon bonds, which pay no cash interest but instead are worth more at maturity, that are rated below investment grade. If the company goes under in a few years, the bond holder could wind up with nothing to show for the investment.</p>
        <p>While issues of regular zero-coupon junk bonds have not yet returned to the record levels of 1988, before the collapse of the junk market, those of convertible zeros have set a record this year. Buyers hope the stock will soar, so conversion will be profitable, but figure that the promise of interest provides protection against a bear market in stocks.</p>
        <p>So enthusiastic are buyers that issuers must promise little in the way of interest. The latest issue, from Office Depot, promises just 4 percent, with payment in seven years if the stock has not risen enough to make conversion worthwhile. FLOYD NORRIS</p>
