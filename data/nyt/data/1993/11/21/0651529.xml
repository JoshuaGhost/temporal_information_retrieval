        <p>Edward J. Rollins Jr., the Republican strategist who touched off a political wildfire with assertions that Republicans had spent $500,000 to suppress the urban black vote in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, tried to douse the flames during appearances last week before two groups of investigators: a Federal grand jury in Newark and attorneys for the state's Democratic Party.</p>

        <p>Edward J. Rollins Jr., the Republican strategist who touched off a political wildfire with assertions that Republicans had spent $500,000 to suppress the urban black vote in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, tried to douse the flames during appearances last week before two groups of investigators: a Federal grand jury in Newark and attorneys for the state's Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Under oath, Mr. Rollins retracted the boasts he made to reporters in Washington on Nov. 9, calling his initial comments a flash of Beltway bravado and an attempt to needle his rival strategist in the Nov. 2 race, James Carville.</p>
        <p>"There was a subset game going on in this whole campaign," Mr. Rollins said under court-ordered questioning from Democratic Party lawyers. "It's never happened to me in any of the campaigns that I've ever been involved in, and it was the Carville/Rollins, the super-consultant game that was going on."</p>
        <p>His denials apparently did little to put the matter to rest.</p>
        <p>"There is no doubt that Ed Rollins did not give us the smoking gun," said the chairman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, State Senator Raymond J. Lesniak. "But I am not going to drop our investigation based on his bizarre explanation." JERRY GRAY</p>
