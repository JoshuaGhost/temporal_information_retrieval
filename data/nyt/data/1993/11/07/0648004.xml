        <p>Christine Todd Whitman has thrown a wide net in her search for people to serve in her new administration, but the final staffing and policy decisions will probably be made in the Governor-elect's living room with just her immediate family on hand.</p>
        <p>Friends and advisers say Mrs. Whitman often seeks their counsel but always makes up her own mind. They pictured her as elated that she ran her campaign with little help from Republican Party leaders and will not have to listen to their patronage demands when she fills the dozens of top jobs in the administration that takes over in January.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's husband, John, and her brother, Webster B. Todd Jr., played significant roles in the campaign, even though Mr. Todd gave up the role of day-to-day campaign manager to defuse criticism that he was responsible for some early campaign gaffes. Mrs. Whitman made it clear that she would continue to rely on her family's advice although they are likely to take no formal role in the government. Fresh Faces Are Sought</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman and the two heads of her transition team were members of the administration of Gov. Thomas H. Kean during the 1980's, and this has raised speculation that a number of her Cabinet appointments will be from that Republican administration. But interviews with her advisers indicate that Mrs. Whitman wants an administration made up of more fresh faces than familiar ones.</p>
        <p>The transition team has been seeking recommendations for appointments from people in and out of government around the state. Of the roughly 3,500 jobs that a governor can fill, there are about 50 with administrative and policy-making roles that are most coveted.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the transition committee are Hazel Frank Gluck, who was co-chairwoman of Mrs. Whitman's campaign and held several positions in the Kean administration, including Transportation Commissioner, and John P. Sheridan Jr., who preceeded Mrs. Gluck as transportation chief. Mrs. Whitman was a member of Mr. Kean's Cabinet as president of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners. Chief of Staff Chosen</p>
        <p>The first two staff appointments announced by Mrs. Whitman were those of Judith Shaw of Princeton to be her chief of staff and Peter Verniero of Warren Township to be chief counsel to the Governor. Ms. Shaw was an aide to Ms. Gluck when she was in the State Assembly and chief of staff of the Transportation Department when Ms. Gluck was Commissioner. Mr. Verniero, a former executive director of the Republican State Committee, was a legal representative of the Whitman campaign.</p>
        <p>Another woman expected to play a major role in the administration is Lonna Hooks, a lawyer at Schering-Plough, who was Mrs. Whitman's chief of staff at the Board of Public Utility Commissioners. Ms. Hooks was with the Governor-elect when she went into a meeting with legislative leaders on Thursday at which Mrs. Whitman reportedly expressed disappointment at some statements by the leadership that indicated they were not ready to endorse her plan to roll back income taxes by 30 percent over the next three years.</p>
        <p>Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, who convinced Mrs. Whitman to support a pilot school voucher program for his city, which he said was a major factor in winning his endorsement, said he told her right after her election victory to be sure to follow through on her tax rollback pledge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schundler, who is also a member of the transition team, said if Mrs. Whitman does not keep her word the voters will punish the Republican Party the way it did the Democrats after Gov. Jim Florio said he saw no need to raise taxes during the 1989 campaign and then raised them by $2.8 billion. "I told her that If you break an explicit promise the voter anger becomes a vendetta," Mr. Schundler said. Sticks to Decisions</p>
        <p>Former Governor Kean, one of the the people from whom Mrs. Whitman sought advice during the campaign, said she often makes up her mind quickly and sticks to her decisions. "She's stronger than anybody thinks, and if the legislative leadership believes otherwise, they're going to be surprised," Mr. Kean said.</p>
        <p>The former Governor recalled that during last year's Republican National Convention Mrs. Whitman was one of the leaders in the New Jersey delegation who were opposed to the anti-abortion plank in the party's platform. Mr. Kean said he agreed with Mrs. Whitman's position but decided not to support a floor challenge unless several other state delegations were willing to do the same.</p>
        <p>"But Christie wanted a floor challenge and spoke eloquently, saying it should be opposed on moral grounds, whether or not it was politically wise," he said. The vote by members of the delegation, however, was 33 to 27 against mounting a floor fight.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman's friends include people in the public eye, like Malcolm (Steve) Forbes, the publisher of Forbes magazine, who grew up in the Somerset Hills area with Mrs. Whitman, and people out of the spotlight, like Paul D. Vartanian, a business executive who lives in Far Hills, close enough to Mrs. Whitman's home in Oldwick to call himself a neighbor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vartanian said Mrs. Whitman's friends advised her not to engage in negative campaigning against Mr. Florio, something her paid campaign advisers were urging her to do. "She resisted as much as she could and didn't get into any real nasty stuff," Mr. Vartanian said. "She stuck to trying to give people her vision for the state, and in the end the people got the message."</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes was one of Mrs. Whitman's advisers on her tax rollback plan and is expected to be one of the people she looks to for advice on fiscal matters. Mrs. Whitman has said that appointing a state treasurer will be her most important decision since the state still faces a budget deficit in 1994.</p>
        <p>Among those mentioned for that position are Michael M. Horn, who served as Treasurer for a time in the Kean administration; State Senator Henry P. McNamara of Franklin Lakes, a fiscal conservative who has voted against recent state budgets, and Assemblyman Rodney P. Frelinghuysen of Morristown, chairman of the Appropriations Committee.</p>
