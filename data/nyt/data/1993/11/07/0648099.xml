        <p>U.C.L.A. 40, Washington State 27</p>
        <p>Rob Walker, pressed into action when starter Wayne Cook was injured, threw two touchdown passes to J. J. Stokes as U.C.L.A. kept its Rose Bowl hopes alive yesterday with a 40-27 Pac-10 victory over Washington State in Pullman. Walker, a sophomore, was 14 of 33 passing for 181 yards. No. 6 in The New York Times computer rankings and No. 12 in The Associated Press poll, U.C.L.A. (7-2, 5-1 Pac-10) can claim the conference championship by beating Arizona State next week and Southern Cal on Nov. 20. Southern Cal 45, Stanford 20</p>
        <p>Johnnie Morton broke a Pac-10 receiving record as Southern Cal kept alive its Rose Bowl hopes in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Morton caught four passes for 127 yards and two touchdowns from Johnson. On his first reception, a 30-yard scoring catch from Rob Johnson in the first quarter, Morton surpassed the conference record of 1,124 receiving yards set by Washington State's Mike Levenseller in 1976. Johnson finished 22 of 35 for 349 yards and 3 touchdowns. His 23 touchdown passes this season are two more than the U.S.C. record set by Rodney Peete in 1987. Colorado 31, Oklahoma State 14</p>
        <p>Colorado's Charles Johnson caught two of Kordell Stewart's three touchdown passes, and Stewart added a 17-yard scoring run for the Buffaloes, No. 25 according to The New York Times and No. 23 with The Associated Press. Air Force 25, Army 6</p>
        <p>Wayne Young ran for a career-high 103 yards on just nine carries and scored twice, helping Air Force beat its service-academy rival at the Air Force Academy. The Falcons' defense was led by linebacker Steve Walker's 13 tackles.</p>
