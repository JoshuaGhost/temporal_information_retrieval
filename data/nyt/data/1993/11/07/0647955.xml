        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Reading Christopher Gray's Aug. 29 article on the Central Park Hooverville brought back memories of the shantytown in my neighborhood along Riverside Drive. I lived on West End Avenue as a child in the 30's and 40's and my parents frequently took me walking along the drive overlooking the Hooverville that had grown up between the open cut of the west side New York Central freight tracks and the Hudson River. We saw men gathered around open fires in empty oil drums much as we see today among the homeless -- especially in my new East Side neighborhood under the Queensborough Bridge on First Avenue.</p>

        <p>Reading Christopher Gray's Aug. 29 article on the Central Park Hooverville brought back memories of the shantytown in my neighborhood along Riverside Drive. I lived on West End Avenue as a child in the 30's and 40's and my parents frequently took me walking along the drive overlooking the Hooverville that had grown up between the open cut of the west side New York Central freight tracks and the Hudson River. We saw men gathered around open fires in empty oil drums much as we see today among the homeless -- especially in my new East Side neighborhood under the Queensborough Bridge on First Avenue.</p>
        <p>I never felt particularly afraid of these men in the 30's who, as I remember them, were decently dressed and not menacing. But it was one of the sights for the people living in the high-rise apartment houses on Riverside Drive or West End Avenue to take in on a Sunday stroll between 96th and 110th Streets.</p>
        <p>Several of these men had set up stands on the drive, West End, and Broadway, selling apples for a nickel. I remember my father talking to one of these men, whom he seemed to know from his business, and giving him a dollar for an apple. The man became tearful and wanted to sell my father his overcoat for $10 but my dad refused and instead pressed an additional $5 on him.</p>
        <p>I never understood then the cause or real meaning of the Great Depression but the memory of that Hooverville has given me a much closer feeling for the homeless people of today. J. MITCHELL JABLONS  Manhattan</p>
