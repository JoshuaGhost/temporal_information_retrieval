        <p>I've never run the New York City Marathon and I hope I am never forced to as penance for any sin. In my years of dashing for buses, bolting for half-closed elevators and sprinting to the Mister Softee truck, I doubt I've run 26.2 miles in my life. This doesn't make me a bad person. Just a lazy one.</p>
        <p>This is not said to discuss my athletic ineptitude or my percentage of body fat but to illustrate that while I don't willingly or rapidly put one foot in front of the other, I relish watching others shvitz their way through the marathon.</p>

        <p>This is not said to discuss my athletic ineptitude or my percentage of body fat but to illustrate that while I don't willingly or rapidly put one foot in front of the other, I relish watching others shvitz their way through the marathon.</p>
        <p>The perfect perch is, of course, at home where ABC displays a five-borough fabric to you in the friendly confines of your living rooms. THEY HAD A MASSIVE FALSE START LAST YEAR: WHAT WILL THEY DO THIS TIME?  Last year, more than 1,000 male runners jumped the cannon blast by 55 seconds in the biggest false start since the Bay of Pigs invasion. Well, the cannon is gone (demobilized in the Defense Department's scaling down), and ABC has provided the ultimate starting mechanism: Runners will start their engines when Dan Dierdorf is completely catapulted from the eastbound side of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the westbound side and his screaming ("PUT ST. LOUIS BACK IN THE N.F.L.!") stops. VERRAZANO, THE UNTOLD STORY What ABC has never fully captured (probably because Geraldo Rivera is no longer there) is the true story on the bridge before the race starts and 25,000-plus people tramp into Brooklyn. Edging their way between runners are Nike chieftain Phil Knight and Reebok chairman Paul Fireman personally checking the fit of their running shoes on top marathoners (and anybody else who will stand still for the deluxe service). This year, the retired Michael Jordan will be Knight's aide-de-socks. ABC SHOULDN'T MISS THE LEADER'S BREAK AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU The marathon itself is about as exciting as televised soccer until a runner breaks away from the pack. ABC masks that lack of excitement with 20 cameras all over the course, good features and sharp cutting from runner to runner. Two years ago, ABC missed Salvador Garcia's break and altogether failed to capture his heretofore unknown detour into Ratner's for a nice onion bagel with whitefish. IMUS'S RUNNING COMEBACK STARTS AT THE MARATHON Don Imus, the WFAN Radio demigod and running devotee, will mark his 10-week recovery from lung surgery by delivering half-hourly reports for ABC but will also end the show with a special 10-kilometer race and tree-climbing competition against Rush Limbaugh.</p>
        <p>I WANT TO BE LIKE LARRY Larry Rawson is one of five ABC on-course reporters who ride perilously beside a cameraman on the open back of a moving vehicle to capture the road's-eye view of the runners. How did he get such a fun job? Practice, like anything else. Each morning for weeks before the marathon, he rides the back of a go-kart around the Central Park Reservoir training his home video camera on the jogging figures of Madonna and Jacqueline Onassis. PRAY FOR GOOD WEATHER Lousy weather wrecks transmissions on this most delicate of telecasts, where signals are required to bounce off buildings, helicopters, sneaker aglets and Telly Savalas's head before landing inside your TV sets. Thunder, lightning and precipitation would make for a broadcast with a lot of unsightly screen snow, which would force you to listen to radio reports (nothing like road-racing without pictures) or, God forbid, heading outside to watch it in person. SPANNING THE WALLS AND PIPES OF NEW YORK'S SCHOOLS, FROM STATEN ISLAND TO SUNNYSIDE, 'THE WIDE WORLD OF ASBESTOS' The marathon gives ABC a chance to feast on the great landmarks of the five boroughs like Ellis Island, Sylvia's restaurant, a bagel store and the Carnegie Deli. A feature of ABC's telecast will be an exclusive running tour of schools with asbestos, hosted by the jogging special correspondent, Schools Chancellor Ramon Cortines. CAN WE GIVE THEM SOME BREATHING ROOM, PLEASE?  Once the winners finish, let's give them some time before Donna DeVarona subjects them to questioning. Of course, there is great admiration for the winners' ability to answer the questions without hyperventilating or falling over in exhaustion after completing 26.2 miles. Give them 10 minutes to stop sweating. Let them put pants on. Asking them about the turning point of the race while they're heaving is as inconsiderate as asking Rudolph Giuliani how he's feeling before he cements his combover onto his head.</p>
