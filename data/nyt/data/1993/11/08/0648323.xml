        <p>A.T.&amp; T. and the state-owned telephone companies of France and Germany may be close to forming a joint venture that will offer one-stop shopping for corporations that want to link offices on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>If it comes to pass, the new venture would rival the alliance formed earlier this year by British Telecommunications P.L.C. and MCI Communications, the second-largest American long-distance carrier.</p>
        <p>American Telephone and Telegraph has made no secret of its efforts to negotiate deals with a few big European partners, and it has already formed an Asian partnership called Worldsource with Singapore Telecom and the Japanese carrier Kokusai Denshim Denwa.</p>
        <p>A European partnership would compete head to head against the alliance formed by British Telecom and MCI. British Telecom agreed this spring to pay $4.3 billion for 20 percent of MCI, and the two companies are setting up a joint venture to market global services.  Trade Publication Report</p>
        <p>Monday's edition of Communications Week International, a trade publication, reports that A.T.&amp; T. has now drafted a memorandum of understanding with France Telecom and Deutsche Bundespost Telekom. According to the magazine, the three companies hope to announce a firm deal sometime in December.</p>
        <p>Unlike the deal between MCI and British Telecom, none of the companies in the new partnership would invest in one another. Instead, the three companies would limit themselves to creating a new venture along the lines of the A.T.&amp; T. alliance in Asia.</p>
        <p>The goal of such alliances is to offer a complete package of global networking services, so big multinational companies can communicate with their overseas offices as easily as they call across town. The alliances also enable partners to gain access to one another's customers.  Finally, such alliances make it easier to agree on common technical standards, so people might call an overseas office by dialing a four-digit code.</p>
        <p>A.T.&amp; T. officials refused to comment on the report of a possible agreement, though they readily acknowledged that talks have been under way with potential partners in Europe. "It is no secret that A.T.&amp; T. seeks alliances," said Herb Linnen, a company spokesman. "Our discussions intensified after May 25, when we announced Worldsource. We would prefer one or two partners in Europe rather than 11 or 12."  A.T.&amp; T. Plans Deal In Europe</p>
