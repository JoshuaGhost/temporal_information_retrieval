        <p>Two days after he traded defenseman James Patrick, the player furthest out of favor with Coach Mike Keenan, Rangers General Manager Neil Smith managed to sign holdout Jeff Beukeboom, the defenseman Keenan has longed to see in a New York jersey.</p>
        <p>Beukeboom, 28, agreed to terms late this afternoon and is expected to join the team in time for practice Friday. He signed a three-year contract that is believed to be worth slightly more than $2 million. Beukeboom will earn approximately $650,000 this season, $675,000 the next and $700,000 in the final year.</p>
        <p>The agreement ended a month-long holdout. After agreeing to participate in training camp and preseason competition despite his lack of a contract, Beukeboom returned home to Ajax, Ontario, the day before the Rangers played their opening game.</p>
        <p>Beukeboom, who was not available for comment today, could be back in action as early as Saturday afternoon, when the Rangers play the Nordiques in Quebec.</p>
        <p>"We wanted to make the team whole and not have any outstanding issues that would keep us from being the best we could be," Smith said. "This was the last issue that was out there that we hadn't done and that was upsetting. We don't like to have our players sitting out and not with the team. I think we're a better team with Jeff Beukeboom."</p>
        <p>A solid, physical defenseman who won three Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, Beukeboom played below his capabilities last season, perhaps because his regular partner, Brian Leetch, missed 48 games with injuries. Starting in training camp, though, Keenan has been extremely vocal in his desire to have the 6-5, 225-pound, stay-at-home style defenseman on his roster. Just this morning Keenan responded to a question about his current comfort level with his team by making another pitch to get Beukeboom signed.</p>
        <p>"I wish Beukeboom would make up his mind to get his butt in here," Keenan said. "We could use him. I've made references from time to time about the team not being physical enough and he's part of that."</p>
        <p>Up until the past few weeks, communication between Smith and Beukeboom and his agent Mark Hall had been minimal, and mainly carried out via fax. Smith obviously had grown frustrated with Beukeboom's failure to make any notable compromises -- Beukeboom's tendency to turn down the organization's offers without countering drove Smith crazy -- but, perhaps because of Keenan's strong and public interest in the defenseman, Smith continued to make efforts to get the deal done.</p>
        <p>"I don't think you're going to see a Ranger player will find it necessary to stay home to get adequate or commensurate compensation for his contribution to the team," said Smith, who recently likened the negotiations with Beukeboom to holding a conversation with himself in the mirror. "So I think it's very unique -- to put it in a nice way -- that this occurred."</p>
        <p>Two days ago, Smith faxed an offer to Hall, but the initial response from the agent was not promising. Smith was stunned, then, when Hall called today and accepted the offer without changes.</p>
        <p>"I've been surprised a number of times throughout this whole process," Smith said. "This was only the last surprise. They must have had a change of heart. I think we bent quite a bit to get Jeff in here."</p>
        <p>Although Smith was hoping to sign Beukeboom for an annual salary figure in the low-to-mid $500,000 range, his final deal with the defenseman does represent a compromise from the player's side as well. Beukeboom asked for around $800,000 originally, then increased his demands to $900,000 shortly after the season began. SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>MIKE RICHTER will start in goal for the eighth straight game when the Rangers face the Nordiques Saturday in Quebec. . . . MARK MESSIER gave himself a haircut this week -- actually, it was more like a shave -- and now has little more than fuzz on his head. "I'm trying to hide the grey," Messier joked. . . . Defenseman ALEKSANDR KARPOVTSEV is suffering from a bruised left hip and is considered day-to-day.</p>
