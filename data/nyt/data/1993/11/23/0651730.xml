        <p>In nationwide municipal elections depicted as an oracle of things to come, Italian voters registered their disappointment with the tainted parties of the mainstream by turning to the neo-Fascist and ex-Communist candidates in record numbers.</p>
        <p>In 428 mayoral ballots from Palermo to Venice on Sunday more than one quarter of Italy's 40 million voters supported the neo-Fascist Italian Social Movement, the Democratic Party of the Left, successor to the Communist Party of Italy, or the insurgent Northern League.</p>
        <p>In Rome and Naples, the neo-Fascists emerged as the single biggest party, even though their candidates trailed those supported by the Democratic Party of the Left in the contests for mayor. In five of the six major cities that set the pace for the vote, candidates supported by alliances of the left, dominated by former Communists, emerged as front-runners.</p>
        <p>And, as votes were tallied today after exit polls last night first gave an inkling of the result, the implications began to emerge, too.  More Pressure on Old Guard</p>
        <p>For one thing, the outcome meant increased pressure for an early national vote to purge the old guard of politicians elected to the current Parliament in April 1992, just as the country's huge corruption scandal was beginning to break. Over 3,000 politicians and businessmen have been implicated in the billion-dollar kickback scandal, which has totally discredited much of Italy's business elite and many of the country's post-war political leaders, including some of the top leaders of the governing four-party coalition -- the Christian Democrats, the Socialists, the Liberals and the Social Democrats.</p>
        <p>Of the coalition members, only the Christian Democrats, for decades the dominant party in Italy, registered at all in the current election, and their share of the ballot dropped from around 30 percent in the April 1992 vote to less than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>Their decline signaled a further shift in Italian society. Throughout the cold war, the Christian Democrats cast themselves as a bulwark against Communism and as the dutiful heir of the huge Roman Catholic vote. Church leaders openly supported them. But today, even Vatican Radio acknowledged that the election had ended what the Catholic Church used to term its "unified" vote.</p>
        <p>Rather than help clear the air, the vote led Italians into a new and confusing political arena: The ex-Communists are trying to cast themselves as the new center, and the neo-Fascists are offering themselves as the backbone of respectable conservatism.</p>
        <p>"There can be no right wing without the Italian Social Movement," said neo-Fascist candidate Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of the Italian dictator. Miss Mussolini came second in the mayoral race in Naples, behind Antonio Bassolino, a leftist, but her party emerged as the single biggest bloc in the city. Northern League's Limits</p>
        <p>Only in the north did the election provide a clear indication of the geographic limits to the federalist-minded Northern League: the League scored well in Venice and Genoa, but those cities seemed to represent the southern perimeter of its influence. In Rome, its candidates polled roughly the same number of votes as Moana Pozzi, a porn star who won around one percent of the ballot in her race for mayor.</p>
        <p>Under new regulations, mayoral candidates must win at least 50 percent of the vote to be elected on the first ballot. Only one candidate in a major city, Leoluca Orlando, an anti-Mafia crusader in Palermo, achieved a first-round victory.</p>
        <p>The country now faces divisive battles between the ex-Communists, the neo-Fascists and the Northern League in run-offs scheduled for Dec. 5. in major cities.</p>
        <p>The demise of the Christian Democrats has left Italian politics without an identifiable middle-ground. Both the former Communist Party, once the biggest in Western Europe, and the neo-Fascists seek to depict themselves as mainstream alternatives.</p>
        <p>For the neo-Fascists that is proving difficult. Miss Mussolini's rallies drew skinheads chanting "Duce! Duce!" -- the rallying call of her grandfather -- even though the party leader, Rome mayoral candidate Gianfranco Fini, has sought to mold a moderate platform offering tax breaks and clean government.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party of the Left, by contrast, maintains its historic commitment to worker's rights. But the party has tacitly supported the coalition of Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi by refraining from attacks on policies promising less state spending and the privatization of state industry.</p>
