        <p>On the morning after, James Brady slept in. But his wife, Sarah, was up and reveling in the late-night Saturday turnaround victory in the Senate for the gun-control measure that she and her husband had labored to pass for more than five grueling years.</p>
        <p>"It was like a Dewey-Truman story," Mrs. Brady said in a telephone interview this morning.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brady's reference to Harry S. Truman's remarkable eleventh-hour comeback victory over Thomas E. Dewey in the 1948 Presidential election was apt. The bill had been pronounced dead on Friday -- and again as late as Saturday afternoon -- by both lawmakers and analysts. Then it suddenly was revived in a legislative and emotional roller-coaster ride for the Bradys.</p>
        <p>The signs for the legislation had been positive this year, and the bill passed the House on Nov. 11. But the Bradys said that all last week, while awaiting Senate action, they had been had been feeling "lurkey," a Bradyism that rhymes with "turkey" and means an ice-water feeling in the heart. A Tumultuous Week</p>
        <p>"It's just been a week of so many highs and lows," Mrs. Brady, who heads Handgun Control Inc., a national organization of gun-control advocates, said this morning. Her husband was still asleep, recuperating from a late-night news conference with Senator Howard O. Metzenbaum, a strong supporter of the Brady bill.</p>
        <p>The bill is named for Mr. Brady, the former Presidential press secretary who was critically wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. He has had to use a wheelchair ever since.</p>
        <p>The Brady bill would require a handgun buyer to wait five working days while the dealer checked whether the person was eligible to own one. Current law prohibits the sale of firearms to felons, fugitives, the mentally incompetent, minors, drug and alcohol abusers, and illegal immigrants. A Change in Climate</p>
        <p>It was probably a changed social and political climate as much as anything that allowed the bill's passage. Since Mrs. Brady began to lobby for a gun-control law seven years ago, there has been an explosion of gun-related violence in the nation. Legislators are now more sympathetic to gun controls than in the past, particularly in light of recent polls that indicate crime and violence have become the top concern of Americans, ahead of the economy and unemployment.</p>
        <p>Even so, for weeks before the votes in Congress, the Bradys pitched phone calls with the intensity of combat soldiers, shoring up supporters and wooing fence sitters. But the Bradys have not been simply lobbyists; rather they have been crucial strategists in the gun-control movement. This morning Mrs. Brady was savoring one of several gambles they took -- the decision to strip the Brady bill out of the overall crime package in which it had been trapped for several years.</p>
        <p>That shift let the Senate overwhelmingly approve a $23 billion anti-crime package on Friday that bans assault-style firearms and provides money to help local governments hire 100,000 new police. It also allowed the Brady bill to be separated from controversies within the crime bill and to stand or fall on its own merits. Taking the Hard Way</p>
        <p>"It just feels so good to know that the legislative strategy of keeping the bill separate worked," Mrs. Brady said. "A lot of people thought we should have taken the easy route and put it in the crime bill, but that would have made it too easy for our opponents. We felt strongly that the American public, which supports this bill, ought to have the chance to see who was opposed to it."</p>
        <p>On another tactical question, one House member said that during the crucial last minutes of the vote last week James Brady argued persuasively that backers of the Brady bill should support it, even though the bill that emerged included an amendment that would cause the legislation to expire after five years.</p>
        <p>"Jim's argument was persuasive that we should vote for the bill with the amendment," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. "He said we've got to keep this alive, even if it has parts we don't like."</p>
        <p>The Bradys' bleakest moments came on Friday and Saturday, when it seemed that they would see a repeat of 1991, when the bill, then part of an anti-crime package, failed. On Friday, proponents twice failed by three votes to get the 60 required to cut off a Republican filibuster.</p>
        <p>At a Saturday afternoon press conference, Mrs. Brady blamed Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and the "N.R.A. Republicans" for the slim hope of getting the bill passed.</p>
        <p>"I'm just really angry this time," Mrs. Brady said in a later interview.  She said that gun-control advocates had the votes to pass the bill this year, but that Mr. Dole had made the bill an issue of party solidarity instead of one of public safety.</p>
        <p>In the end, party solidarity broke. 'Full-Court Press'</p>
        <p>"I think the country was ripe and wants this badly," said Mrs. Brady, who attributed the filibuster to the National Rifle Association's "full-court press the last couple of days."</p>
        <p>The Bradys believe that the measure's five-day waiting period can help slow the proliferation of guns. They argue that even a superficial background check, for instance, would have warned a Texas pawnshop owner that John Hinckley Jr., the man who shot Mr. Reagan and Mr. Brady, had recently been arrested for trying to carry a shotgun aboard an airliner.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brady became involved in the fight to control handguns before her husband did, but not as an immediate consequence of Mr. Brady's shooting.</p>
        <p>In 1985, while the Bradys were visiting her husband's hometown, Centralia, Ill., their son Scott, then 5 years old, crawled into a family friend's pickup truck and spied what he took to be a plaything on the seat. It was a gun. 'Don't Do That, Scott'</p>
        <p>When he picked it up and pointed it at his mother, who also thought it was a toy, as she climbed in beside him, she recalled admonishing him: "Don't do that, Scott. Don't ever point a gun at anyone, even a toy."</p>
        <p>Then she realized it was a gun -- a loaded, .22-caliber pistol, like the $29 gun Mr. Hinckley had used four years earlier to shoot her husband.</p>
        <p>"My blood just boiled," said Mrs. Brady. "My husband had been shot, and here my child was with a gun."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brady said she picked up the phone, called Handgun Control Inc. and has been passionately involved ever since.</p>
        <p>"I thought, 'We've got to go on the offensive,' " she said in a recent interview.</p>
        <p>"And you got fairly offensive," quipped her husband. Formidable Opponents</p>
        <p>In the years since that jarring experience with their son, Sarah and Jim Brady, who is vice chairman of the National Organization on Disability, have emerged as formidable opponents of the N.R.A. And the Bradys will not disappear from the fray even after the legislation they have championed becomes law.</p>
        <p>"We've got a full agenda," said Mrs. Brady, speaking about her organization, which offers an education program for young people on gun violence and is pressing to reform the procedures for licensing gun dealers.</p>
        <p>Illustrating how simple it is to become a legal dealer in firearms, Mr. Brady told some recent visitors, "If you've got 10 minutes and $10, we could make you all dealers."</p>
