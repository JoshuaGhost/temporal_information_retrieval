        <p>The women's soccer team at the University of North Carolina captured its eighth consecutive National Collegiate Athletic Association title yesterday with a 6-0 triumph over George Mason at Chapel Hill, N.C.</p>
        <p>The game was played before a crowd of 5,721, the largest in the history of women's collegiate soccer.</p>
        <p>The Tar Heels' victory yesterday was their 23d of the season and their 81st in a row. North Carolina has captured the title every year but one since the N.C.A.A. started the women's tournament in 1982.</p>
        <p>George Mason, won the 1985 championship, but it couldn't keep up with the Tar Heels yesterday. Keri Sanchez opened the scoring with a goal less than two minutes into the game and Danielle Egan closed it with less than two minutes to go.</p>
        <p>The men's Division I tournament completed its second round over the weekend and the University of Virginia, the champion the last two years, reached the quarterfinals with a 2-1 victory yesterday over Loyola of Baltimore in a game played in Charlottesville, Va.</p>
        <p>Claudio Reyna, the best midfielder at the collegiate level, scored the winner for the Cavaliers with a blistering shot from 20 yards away with 8 minutes left.</p>
        <p>Virginia's opponent in the quarterfinals will be Wisconsin, a 1-0 winner over Indiana yesterday in a game at Bloomington, Ind.</p>
        <p>Hartwick College also reached the quarterfinals with a 2-1 overtime triumph over Boston University yesterday in Oneonta, N.Y., and will meet Princeton, a 5-2 winner over Penn State on Saturday. Ian McIntyre, the sweeper, scored the winner for Hartwick with 12 minutes left in the second overtime.</p>
        <p>South Carolina reached the quarterfinals for the second time in four years with a 3-2 triumph at Clemson yesterday and will meet Air Force, a 2-1 winner over North Carolina.</p>
        <p>The other quarterfinal will be between California-Fullerton, which won by 3-2 yesterday over the University of San Diego, last year's runner-up to Virginia, and San Francisco, a 2-1 winner over St. Louis in San Francisco Saturday night.</p>
