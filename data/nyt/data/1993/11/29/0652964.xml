        <p>Commemorative stamps are useful, collectible, profitable and informative. Each year, a Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee sifts through thousands of suggestions to decide whom and what the U.S. Postal Service should commemorate. When it meets in early December, the panel has a chance to honor a selfless hero, Raoul Wallenberg, who vanished in 1944 after saving as many as 100,000 people from Nazi death camps.</p>
        <p>Such a gesture would do justice to the memory of a remarkable man. As a Swedish diplomat in Budapest, he provided life-saving documents to Jews who were marked for death.</p>

        <p>Commemorative stamps are useful, collectible, profitable and informative. Each year, a Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee sifts through thousands of suggestions to decide whom and what the U.S. Postal Service should commemorate. When it meets in early December, the panel has a chance to honor a selfless hero, Raoul Wallenberg, who vanished in 1944 after saving as many as 100,000 people from Nazi death camps.</p>
        <p>Such a gesture would do justice to the memory of a remarkable man. As a Swedish diplomat in Budapest, he provided life-saving documents to Jews who were marked for death.</p>
        <p>His fate remains a cold-war riddle; all that can be said for certain is that he was arrested by Soviet forces and disappeared into the gulag. By unanimous vote, Congress made him an honorary American citizen, a distinction he shares with Winston Churchill.</p>
        <p>An ecumenical grass-roots campaign has generated broad support for a Wallenberg stamp. What seems persuasive is that his deeds have taken on particular significance in a world where people once again are being killed solely because of their ethnic origins. Raoul Wallenberg's spirit cries out not just for remembrance, but for emulation.</p>
