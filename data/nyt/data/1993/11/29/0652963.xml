        <p>Of modern weapons, none is more ubiquitous and invisible than the land mine. Wars end, but these buried destroyers go on killing and maiming for decades. They are inexpensive weapons, ideal for third-world conflicts. A Chinese antipersonnel mine costs as little as $3; the popular U.S.-made Claymore, which can propel 700 steel balls forward in a 60 degree arc and kill at a distance of 50 yards, costs only $27. So secretive are their sale and deployment that nobody really knows where or how many mines remain in the ground.</p>
        <p>The State Department estimates that from 65 million to 110 million land mines infest 62 countries, notably Afghanistan, Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, El Salvador, the Kurdish areas of Iraq and northern Somalia. This and other disclosures fill a 510-page report by the Arms Project of Human Rights Watch, which makes the case for a total ban on the sale and use of antipersonnel land mines.</p>

        <p>Of modern weapons, none is more ubiquitous and invisible than the land mine. Wars end, but these buried destroyers go on killing and maiming for decades.

A Chinese antipersonnel mine costs as little as $3; the popular U.S.-made Claymore, which can propel 700 steel balls forward in a 60 degree arc and kill at a distance of 50 yards, costs only $27. So secretive are their sale and deployment that nobody really knows where or how many mines remain in the ground.</p>
        <p>The State Department estimates that from 65 million to 110 million land mines infest 62 countries, notably Afghanistan, Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, El Salvador, the Kurdish areas of Iraq and northern Somalia. This and other disclosures fill a 510-page report by the Arms Project of Human Rights Watch, which makes the case for a total ban on the sale and use of antipersonnel land mines.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, a total ban won't happen soon: demand is strong and many arms-producing countries compete for the profits these infernal machines earn. But a total ban on antipersonnel mines is a just goal, and a global campaign is now taking off. Meantime, more needs to be done to clear existing mine fields and make a repugnant weapon less enduringly deadly.</p>
        <p>Like poison gas, land mines made their first appearance in World War I, when Germans buried fused artillery shells to counter allied tank offensives. In the 1920's, the use of chemical weapons was successfully outlawed, in part because belligerents had a mutual interest in respecting the ban. By contrast, land mines were less obviously horrifying, easier to use than chemical weapons, and had the tactical benefit of forcing tanks into narrow passages that had been swept of mines.</p>
        <p>Soon new, light, easy-to-handle explosives made possible a demoralizing antipersonnel weapon that could be detonated by a footfall. So great has been the demand that 48 nations now make and sell 340 different models of antipersonnel land mines -- ideal "eternal sentinels," always awake, never demanding food or pay, and allowed by the rules of war. Yet antipersonnel mines have killed or maimed more people than chemical, biological and nuclear warfare.</p>
        <p>Senator Patrick Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, is campaigning to change the rules. He has persuaded the Senate to earmark funds to help other nations clear mine fields, and to extend for three years an existing moratorium that forbids U.S. export of antipersonnel mines. At the United Nations, Mr. Leahy has introduced an American resolution that would bind all member states to stopping the export of land mines. What may make the case is more publicity about the thousands of men, women and children who lose life and limbs every month.</p>
        <p>Achieving a ban will take time. Meanwhile, antipersonnel mines can at least be modified so that in time they self-destruct. Simply discussing design changes can have a salutary effect by providing needed information about the dark bargain basement in the world's arms bazaar.</p>
