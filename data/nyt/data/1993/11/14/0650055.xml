        <p>When Dr. Bruce H. Berlin and Dr. Christopher Puca finished their internal-medicine training at the Nassau County Medical Center in 1983, they set off on divergent paths.</p>
        <p>Dr. Berlin took $15,000 from the cash received in wedding gifts, leased a room in another doctor's office and worked nights and weekends over the next decade to build a thriving private practice all his own. Dr. Puca went to work for the Public Health Service in a medically underserved area in Queens and, in 1990, joined a group practice, where -- for a salary -- he takes care of patients from health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>Although both are now accomplished, financially comfortable doctors on Long Island, their careers have landed them on opposite sides of the health care debate. For Dr. Berlin, President Clinton's plan, which would encourage consumers and doctors to sign up with H.M.O.'s or other low-cost medical plans, poses the threat of a major upheaval. For Dr. Puca, it is a major non-event.</p>
        <p>"This is very scary for a young physician in private practice like myself," said Dr. Berlin, who says he has already watched patients depart for H.M.O.'s, which he says deliver inferior care. "I know I'm going to have to sign up eventually to survive, but I don't like the idea." In contrast, Dr. Puca said: "I don't think the health reforms will change my practice much. I already practice managed care."</p>
        <p>As a growing number of doctors desert private offices in favor of salaried jobs at health maintenance organizations or clinics or hospitals, the once powerful fraternity of medicine has fragmented. Today more than half of all physicians are on salary, and doctors' response to the Clinton health proposal varies tremendously.</p>
        <p>If the President's plan passes, most doctors will be part of a new health care system. But it is clear that some will join gladly, and some screaming. The enthusiasm of doctors like Dr. Puca for managed care is matched by the despair of young specialists who have just sacrificed a decade to training and incurred huge debts with the expectation that they would run their own practice, with plentiful financial rewards. For them the rules seem to be changing in the middle of the game.</p>
