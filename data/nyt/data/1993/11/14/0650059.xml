        <p>For Poor Women, Training In Entrepreneurship</p>
        <p>The American Woman's Economic Development Corporation and the Woman's Center for Education and Career Advancement are offering an entrepreneurial training program for poor women. The program, financed by the city's Department of Employment, will offer students instruction in business skills as well as counseling on personal matters like child care.</p>
        <p>"We are looking for women who are serious about the business they want to be in," said Elisa Moore, director of special training programs at the development corporation. "Our applicants must be highly motivated and willing to commit to attending one seven-hour day from 2 P.M. to 9 P.M. each week for 27 consecutive weeks of classroom training."</p>
        <p>Orientation sessions are planned tomorrow and Thursday and on Dec. 2 and Dec. 7. For information, call (212) 692-9100. Along With Your Paper Comes a Quart of Milk</p>
        <p>It's a return to the past on the Upper West Side, where Mitchell's Newspaper Delivery Service has branched out into the milk delivery business with its subsidiary, the Milkman.</p>
        <p>The company, which has been delivering newspapers in Manhattan and the Bronx for 45 years, purchases milk from Elmhurst Dairies in Jamaica, Queens, and charges its newspaper customers 91 cents a quart or $1.65 a gallon, delivered to their doors between 4 A.M. and 6 A.M.</p>
        <p>About 1,500 of Mitchell's 35,000 Manhattan newspaper customers have signed on for milk. The company hit Lincoln Towers on the West Side first, and hopes eventually to extend service to the East Side and the other boroughs.</p>
        <p>"Manhattan residents are always running out of milk," said Mitchell Newman, president of the Milkman. "They don't have cars to get to the store four or five blocks away, particularly in inclement weather." From Bankers to Anchors: Breakfast Honors Women</p>
