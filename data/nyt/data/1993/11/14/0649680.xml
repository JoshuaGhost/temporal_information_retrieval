        <p>ZONING calculations with a skin strapped on." That is Richard S. Hayden's description of the architecture at 320 Park Avenue, an obsolete 32-year-old office tower that he and his colleagues are redesigning from the bones out as the new headquarters of the Mutual of America Life Insurance Company.</p>
        <p>Mutual bought the 34-story structure from the ailing Olympia &amp; York last year for $130 million and is spending $73 million to reconstruct it. Since 320 Park Avenue was constructed just months ahead of the 1961 Zoning Resolution, it has about one and a half times as much floor space as would be allowed in a new building on the same site, making it well worth an owner's while to rebuild it rather than replace it. Mutual plans to occupy 10 floors and lease the rest when the building reopens in the spring of 1995.</p>

        <p>ZONING calculations with a skin strapped on." That is Richard S. Hayden's description of the architecture at 320 Park Avenue, an obsolete 32-year-old office tower that he and his colleagues are redesigning from the bones out as the new headquarters of the Mutual of America Life Insurance Company.</p>
        <p>Mutual bought the 34-story structure from the ailing Olympia &amp; York last year for $130 million and is spending $73 million to reconstruct it. Since 320 Park Avenue was constructed just months ahead of the 1961 Zoning Resolution, it has about one and a half times as much floor space as would be allowed in a new building on the same site, making it well worth an owner's while to rebuild it rather than replace it. Mutual plans to occupy 10 floors and lease the rest when the building reopens in the spring of 1995.</p>
        <p>In the redesign by Swanke Hayden Connell Architects, the most obvious change to the flat-topped tower between 50th and 51st Streets will be the addition of a 52-foot-high gabled peak, which is to cover the rooftop mechanical equipment.</p>
        <p>But the building will change in other significant ways. Floor space will be carved out of the second floor, to create a more voluminous lobby, and shaved off five mid-rise floors. At the same time, floor space will be added to 10 high-rise floors, where Mutual expects to command the highest rents from its tenants. The mechanical core of the building will be expanded to put more air-distribution rooms on each floor. That, in turn, will permit overhead air ducts to be smaller, meaning that ceilings can be higher.</p>
        <p>Low ceilings are only one of the shortcomings at 320 Park Avenue, which was the ITT Corporation World Headquarters before that company moved out in 1990. The structure is also full of asbestos, as a building of its era would be. And its design -- glass-and-aluminum shoeboxes stacked atop one another -- owes more to the dictates of the Zoning Resolution than to architectural impulse.</p>
        <p>BUT zoning also works in its favor. Ungainly though it may be, 320 Park Avenue has 626,000 square feet of space. Under current zoning, a new building on the same lot could have about 441,000 square feet. In other words, Mutual effectively gets 185,000 square feet more than it would were it to start from scratch.</p>
        <p>Mutual of America is moving only four blocks from its current headquarters, 666 Fifth Avenue, between 52d and 53d Streets, but the journey took almost a decade.</p>
        <p>"The economics were such that we felt we had to leave New York City eight or nine years ago," said William J. Flynn, Mutual's chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
        <p>Westchester County was first to be explored but the stumbling block was the Throgs Neck Bridge, Mr. Flynn said, since so many Mutual employees live in Brooklyn or Queens or on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Long Island came next. Six sites were seriously examined, in Huntington and Garden City, among other places, but all fell through for a variety of reasons.</p>
        <p>By then it was 1990. And, Mr. Flynn said, "Everything had changed so radically that we came back to looking at New York." Among buildings under consideration was 60 Broad Street, at Beaver Street, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert headquarters.</p>
        <p>In the course of this search, Mutual's advisers at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company came across 320 Park Avenue, which fit several key criteria: it was for sale (Mutual no longer wanted to pay commercial rent tax as someone else's tenant), it offered 250,000 square feet of contiguous space for Mutual (which is now scattered through 666 Fifth Avenue), it was in the right part of mid-Manhattan (between the Avenue of the Americas and Lexington Avenue) and it was not too large.</p>
        <p>"It could be no greater than 750,000 square feet," said Manfred Altstadt, senior executive vice president and chief financial officer. "We didn't want to take too much in the way of rental risk."</p>
        <p>Several other factors influenced Mutual's decision to buy the building. One was the passage only days earlier of a bill that froze real estate assessments for eight years on office towers south of 96th Street that underwent modernization.</p>
        <p>"The decision to do this was based on economics," Mr. Flynn said, "rather than wanting a fancy house on Park Avenue."</p>
        <p>"In many ways, we're a quiet company," said Thomas J. Moran, the president and chief operating officer. "When we moved from Park Avenue South to 666 Fifth Avenue, it was to enhance our recognition. Moving to Park Avenue, as an owner, is another step in that direction."</p>
        <p>Mutual's headquarters were at 360 Park Avenue South, at 26th Street, until 1976, when it moved into one 62,000-square-foot floor at 666 Fifth Avenue. "To get the kind of people you wanted," Mr. Flynn recalled, "you had to be in a better neighborhood."</p>
        <p>Since then, Mutual has grown into 175,000 square feet of space at No. 666, occupying the 4th, 10th, 11th and 19th floors. When its original 15-year lease expired in 1991, Mutual negotiated five one-year extensions, to preserve its flexibility in moving.</p>
        <p>Although the company is not expanding -- it has 750 employees -- it will occupy much more space in 320 Park Avenue than it does at 666 Fifth Avenue, taking 275,000 square feet. Individual work areas are being enlarged, as is the cafeteria, and training and conference rooms are being added.</p>
        <p>Asbestos is now being removed from the building. That work is to be finished in February. In the next two months, removal of the existing curtain wall is scheduled to begin.</p>
        <p>Mutual is to occupy floors 2, 6 through 12, 34 and 35. Other floors are to be leased. (The floor count will change to 35, since Mutual is eliminating the designation of 13 -- "Superstition," Mr. Altstadt explained.)</p>
        <p>The reconstruction of 320 Park Avenue was already in the works when Mutual bought the building. In 1990, with the impending departure of ITT, Olympia &amp; York Companies (U.S.A.) planned a $130 million rebuilding, to designs by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. Every floor would have been altered under this approach, with floor area taken off the bottom and added to the top. And the entire facade would have been clad in stone, Mr. Altstadt said, which would have required reinforcement for the steel frame.</p>
        <p>"WE did look hard at the S.O.M. plan," Mr. Altstadt said. "But the one thing that caused us to pause was the dollar amount. If we had to spend $130 million for the core and shell, the economics would have changed radically. We would have had to charge rents of $70 a square foot to make it economically viable." (Asking rents on Park Avenue are now about $40 a square foot a year, according to the Edward S. Gordon Company.)</p>
        <p>"From the beginning," said Mr. Hayden, the architect, "our goal was to take this building that was designed by zoning and start to see how we could create something that was driven by sculpture and design -- and keep it at a responsible budget level."</p>
        <p>"When you walk by that building," said Mr. Moran, Mutual's president, "we want you to have a sense of who we are. It will have a clean, sharp, modern look to it -- yet conservative -- which is how we see ourselves."</p>
        <p>The architects limited the use of stone to the lower 11 floors, where it would be seen by pedestrians. After the first setback, above the 12th floor, the cladding would change to painted aluminum panels. The vertical piers that separate the window bays would be capped by stainless steel moldings.</p>
        <p>"We felt that developing a striking and sophisticated lightweight facade was a better use of money than throwing more money into the structure," Mr. Hayden said.</p>
        <p>The architects made models in two different palettes, one predominantly gray and the other predominantly brown, echoing St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church and the former General Electric Building, both of which are directly across Park Avenue.</p>
        <p>A granite known as Sardinian gray was chosen, even though its color would seem to be at odds with the landmark church. "There are lots of ways of relating that aren't mimicking," Mr. Hayden said. "If you look at St. Bart's in detail, it's got quite a lot of gray stone to it. Although brick is the dominant tone, there's a large amount of limestone in the gray direction and marbles and tiles in a number of colors."</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Moran said, "Browns and reds have been overused in the city."</p>
        <p>Inside, a number of significant changes are to be made. While floor area is reduced on five mid-rise floors, it will be increased in 10 high-rise tower floors. "We're adding space in what we call the high-rent district," Mr. Altstadt said. Those tower floors, which now have 8,000 square feet, will grow to more than 12,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>Another major alteration involves the mechanical core. "We've broken down the supply of air, which is the biggest consumer of space above the ceiling," said Altan O. Gursel, an associate principal at Swanke Hayden Connell. "The air-handling system has been broken down into two or three distribution points rather than one mechanical room on the floor with large ducts coming out."</p>
        <p>By the curious mathematics of zoning, 320 Park Avenue will grow smaller on paper even as it grows larger physically.</p>
        <p>THE building now has 626,000 square feet of gross floor area above ground. Mechanical space, however, is not counted against the floor area that is allowed by zoning. In the existing layout, 49,000 square feet of space is deducted, leaving a building of 577,000 square feet for zoning purposes.</p>
        <p>After reconstruction, there will be an increase in the gross area, to 656,000 square feet. But because the mechanical areas are growing so considerably, the deduction rises to 87,000 square feet. That yields a building of 569,000 square feet for zoning purposes.</p>
        <p>"We went to the limit of what we could put in without any variances being necessary or required," Mr. Moran said.</p>
        <p>On the mid-Manhattan skyline, the most notable facet of the reconstruction will be a gabled peak that is to be illuminated at night.</p>
        <p>"Since this tower is only 35 floors," Mr. Gursel said, "and we had to renovate the mechanical systems on top of the building, we thought that Mutual, as a newcomer on Park Avenue, would like to be recognized."</p>
        <p>Different treatments were studied. There was, for example, a more flattened top with openings cut into it. Mr. Moran likened this to a "sniper's nest." There was a more pinnacle-like top. This, too, was rejected. "It went too far," Mr. Gursel said. "It was as if we were building another church across the street, only it was so tall. It became too powerful, too much of a spire. It looks like we're racing to catch the eye first."</p>
        <p>"One thing we agreed on quickly," Mr. Altstadt said, "is we have to be careful not to do anything that would give the appearance of trying to compete with the church."</p>
        <p>But Mutual did seek a distinctive profile. After all, Mr. Moran said, "when you think about the skyline, there are few of us who wouldn't want to be a part of it."</p>
        <p>Correction:  November 14, 1993, Sunday</p>
        <p>A credit for a drawing on Nov. 14 with an article about the reconstruction of 320 Park Avenue misidentified the firm that rendered the building as it would have looked under a plan proposed in 1990. In a letter dated Dec. 14, a reader reported correctly that it was Kapell &amp; Kostow Architects, not Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill.</p>
