        <p>A former roommate of Mohammed A. Salameh, the lead defendant in the World Trade Center trial, said in court yesterday that two other men accused by the Government of helping to build and place a bomb in the giant towers visited Mr. Salameh in his apartment in Jersey City several times in the months just before the explosion.</p>
        <p>The witness, Ashraf Moneeb, said that starting in September or October last year, he shared apartments on Virginia Avenue in Jersey City with Mr. Salameh and a man he said he knew simply as Rashed. Mr. Salameh is accused of having helped to make the bomb and having rented the van that brought it to the trade center.</p>

        <p>A former roommate of Mohammed A. Salameh, the lead defendant in the World Trade Center trial, said in court yesterday that two other men accused by the Government of helping to build and place a bomb in the giant towers visited Mr. Salameh in his apartment in Jersey City several times in the months just before the explosion.</p>
        <p>The witness, Ashraf Moneeb, said that starting in September or October last year, he shared apartments on Virginia Avenue in Jersey City with Mr. Salameh and a man he said he knew simply as Rashed. Mr. Salameh is accused of having helped to make the bomb and having rented the van that brought it to the trade center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moneeb also identified Rashed from a photograph that had already been shown to the jury as that of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, an Iraqi citizen whose whereabouts are unknown but who is mentioned in the indictment as another of the conspirators. The indictment lists Rashed as one of several aliases used by Mr. Yousef.</p>
        <p>Speaking softly, sometimes in English, sometimes through an interpreter in Arabic, Mr. Moneeb, a 27-year-old student originally from Egypt, said that Mahmud Abouhalima, another defendant, visited the apartment several times as did a man he knew as Abdul Rahman. Abdul Rahman Yasin, who, like Mr. Yousef, is believed to have fled the country after the explosion, is listed in the indictment as one of the bomb builders. Links Between Defendants</p>
        <p>Mr. Moneeb's testimony seemed to confirm only that several of the men named in the indictment knew one another and met from time to time where Mr. Salameh and Mr. Yousef lived. Mr. Moneeb reported no suspicious actions on their part, certainly nothing illegal, and he said he overheard none of their conversations.</p>
        <p>His role in the trial seemed to be to enable the prosecution to put a few more threads into a fabric of contacts and associations that the prosecution is stitching together, linking the men on trial and the two indicted men who left the country after the explosion.</p>
        <p>The man called Rashed by Mr. Moneeb, for example, has already been described to the jury as Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, who arrived at Kennedy International Airport from Pakistan on Sept. 1 last year on the same flight as Ahmad M. Ajaj, the fourth defendant in the case. Then, on Tuesday, two executives with New Jersey banks testified about bank accounts that were held jointly by two of the defendants, Mr. Salameh and Nidal A. Ayyad, and were used to make several cash transfers. Now, with Mr. Moneeb's testimony, the jury was exposed to a portrayal of several of the men meeting in Mr. Salameh's small bedroom where, Mr. Moneeb said, they usually kept the door shut.</p>
        <p>The defense tried to shake Mr. Moneeb's credibility by suggesting, among other things, that he had been pressured by the F.B.I. agents, who questioned him about a week after the explosion, into identifying the suspects as friends of Mr. Salameh's. Confiscated Green Card</p>
        <p>The lawyer for Mr. Abouhalima, Hassen Ibn Abdellah, managed, despite several prosecution objections sustained by Judge Kevin T. Duffy, to garner an admission from Mr. Moneeb that he was expecting to become a citizen around the time the F.B.I. questioned him. His citizenship was delayed when the F.B.I. confiscated his green card, which has not been returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdellah's cross-examination provided the trial with one of the rare moments of drama that it has had in its seven weeks of testimony. Mr. Abdellah is the most confrontational of the defense lawyers. The witness, Mr. Moneeb, seemed nervous. He spoke so quietly that at one point some jurors raised their hands to signal that they could not hear him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abdellah set the stage by asking about Mr. Moneeb's interrogation by the F.B.I., which lasted several hours, on March 7, a bit more than a week after the bombing. He tried to get Mr. Moneeb to say that the F.B.I. had threatened to deport him if he did not "tell them what they wanted to know." That question provoked an objection from the prosecution, sustained by Judge Duffy, as did several other questions along the same lines. Twice Mr. Abdellah, seemingly stymied by the sustained objections, asked for sidebar conferences out of hearing of the jury, and twice Judge Duffy replied with a curt "no."</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Abdellah coaxed from Mr. Moneeb the fact that the F.B.I. had put a gun in his face and handcuffed him when they arrived at his apartment to question him, and that they had taken away his green card. 'Did They Pressure You?'</p>
        <p>Later, during a redirect examination, a prosecutor, Henry DePippo, asked Mr. Moneeb, "When you spoke to the F.B.I., did they pressure you?"</p>
        <p>"No," was Mr. Moneeb's reply.</p>
        <p>"Did you only tell them what you knew?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>"Did you do the same here today?"</p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>With that, Mr. Abdellah was back on his feet.</p>
        <p>"On March 7, the F.B.I. took your green card, didn't it?"</p>
        <p>"Yes," Mr. Moneeb replied.</p>
        <p>"That was pressure, wasn't it?"</p>
        <p>"I was scared," Mr. Moneeb replied.</p>
        <p>"They still haven't given it back to you?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"They told you that after you had testified, you could go back to the F.B.I. and they would decide to give back your green card or not," Mr. Abdellah said.</p>
        <p>At first Mr. Moneeb had difficulty understanding Mr. Abdellah's question. He eventually answered, "They said they will give it back." Lawyer for Egyptian Cleric</p>
        <p>In the case against 15 other defendants charged with plotting to blow up New York City landmarks, Robert M. Beecher, a 46-year-old Manhattan lawyer, was appointed yesterday to serve as standby counsel for Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, who plans to represent himself in the trial sometime next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beecher, whose name was drawn at random from a list of lawyers approved for appointment under a Federal defenders program, would offer the sheik legal advice if asked and would be prepared, if asked, to take over the sheik's defense. Mr. Beecher said he had a "cordial discussion" with Mr. Abdel Rahman in jail yesterday but could not divulge its contents.</p>
