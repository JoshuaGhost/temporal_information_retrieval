        <p>In seeking to win support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Clinton Administration is cutting deals at the expense of people who have the least say in Congress: American consumers and foreigners.</p>
        <p>From wheat and peanut butter to orange juice and lettuce, the Administration has been promising American farmers and the legislators who represent them that it will protect them from foreign competition. In exchange, House members and farm groups have been supporting the trade pact.</p>
        <p>But the Administration's promises are likely to antagonize foreign governments from Paris to Ottawa, where the instinct to defend farmers also runs strong.</p>
        <p>Members of Congress said today that the Administration had promised to restrict Canadian wheat and peanut butter paste shipments to the United States within 60 days unless the Canadian Government did so first. Canadian officials had no immediate reaction.</p>
        <p>Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said that wheat and peanut butter recommendations were on President Clinton's desk this evening but that he declined to discuss the details.</p>
        <p>Representative Harry A. Johnston, Democrat of Florida, said the Administration had recently agreed that it would not accept any deal in world trade talks that would cut American tariffs on orange juice and certain vegetables by more than 15 percent. These tariffs, which are aimed more at Brazil than Mexico, increase orange juice prices up to a third. Switch in Florida?</p>
        <p>Mr. Kantor insisted that the Administration had not changed its position in the world trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade but refused to elaborate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnston predicted that several members of Florida's 23-member delegation would soon switch from opposing the agreement to supporting it.</p>
        <p>Michael O'Hara, the spokesman for the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, said the group had received a letter from Mr. Kantor promising limited cuts in American tariffs on tomatoes, bell peppers, lettuce, cucumbers, celery and sweet corn. Mr. O'Hara also said the group had been promised that Cuba would not be allowed to make duty-free shipments of vegetables to the United States.</p>
