        <p>The Transamerica Corporation said today that it had signed a letter of intent to acquire cargo-container assets from Tiphook P.L.C., the financially troubled British ship container company, for about $1.2 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>The assets, which make up Tiphook's container division, consist primarily of 526,000 containers called T.E.U.'s, for 20-foot equivalent units.</p>

        <p>The Transamerica Corporation said today that it had signed a letter of intent to acquire cargo-container assets from Tiphook P.L.C., the financially troubled British ship container company, for about $1.2 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>The assets, which make up Tiphook's container division, consist primarily of 526,000 containers called T.E.U.'s, for 20-foot equivalent units.</p>
        <p>Tiphook shares soared on the news, with the company's American depository receipts closing today at $3 a share, up $1.375, on the New York Stock Exchange. Transamerica shares closed at $54.625, down 37.5 cents, on the Big Board. A Clouded Outlook</p>
        <p>Tiphook said the sale would substantially reduce its debt, but some analysts said that selling its most valuable asset could spell the end of the struggling company, which has labored under a debt of nearly $2 billion.</p>
        <p>For Transamerica, based here, the acquisition strengthens its leasing activities.</p>
        <p>"This acquisition meets all of our criteria," Frank C. Herringer, Transamerica's president and chief executive, said in a statement. "Most importantly, it is a business we have been in for a long time, know well, and believe has substantial growth potential."</p>
        <p>Over the last few years, Mr. Herringer has moved to divest Transamerica of businesses that fall outside its core of life insurance and financial services. The container business, which dates to the company's broad conglomerate strategy of the 1970's, is in fact a leasing business, which falls under financial services. The acquisition will roughly double the number of containers owned by Transamerica.</p>
        <p>"The combination of our container fleet with Tiphook's will enable us to realize significant cost savings and to improve service to both existing and new customers," Mr. Herringer said.</p>
        <p>Ronald Frank, an analyst with Smith Barney Shearson, said the acquisition of the Tiphook containers would help Transamerica expand in leasing.</p>
        <p>"Leasing is a business they have historically done well in; that they have an expertise in, and a significant presence in the market," he said. "They were dealing from a position of strength with a willing seller." Reassigning Debt</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the letter of intent, the purchase price of about $1.2 billion will be reduced by about $175 million in Tiphook debt to be taken on by Transamerica.</p>
        <p>Transamerica said it would be conducting further examination of Tip hook's financial condition, and that the final terms of the sale contract were yet to be negotiated. Transamerica plans to finance the transaction through a combination of debt and internal funds.</p>
        <p>Any sale will require the approval of Tiphook's shareholders and certain of the company's lenders, as well as the expiration of some regulatory waiting periods. Tiphook said it would be holding discussions with its banks, bondholders and other creditors. Both companies said they expected to complete the contract negotiations by the end of December.</p>
