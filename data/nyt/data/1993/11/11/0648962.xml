        <p>To some parents and politicians, the planning exercise, mandated by a law enacted in the spring, is a Trojan horse being hammered together to force racial quotas and busing on their communities.

        <p>Connecticut is about to call on its 169 towns and cities to do what no state has ever asked: to cooperate in creating, from the local level up, a statewide plan for integrating public schools.</p>
        <p>To some parents and politicians, the planning exercise, mandated by a law enacted in the spring, is a Trojan horse being hammered together to force racial quotas and busing on their communities. To others, it is a weak gesture at bridging the racial and economic gaps that divide the state's poor cities from their wealthy suburbs.</p>
        <p>All Jack Hasegawa has to do is bring everyone together to discuss, very publicly, one of the most sensitive issues in American life, and make the process work.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hasegawa, until last month the director of Dwight Hall, a community-service center for students at Yale University, is the sole full-time employee hired by the state to set in motion the law, "An Act Improving Educational Quality and Diversity."</p>
        <p>Looking at his new surroundings, an isolated cubicle in the State Department of Education with little more than a desk and a telephone, he sees perhaps the best answer to fears that the law's language conceals a plan to impose school desegregation. There is no one to do that.</p>
        <p>"The legislature really meant it, for once, when it said we're going to do this as a locally directed process," Mr. Hasegawa said in an interview. "As far as I can tell, this may be the only time that a state has said, we have to do a basic education reform and we're going to do it by going out to the citizens and asking them to do it."</p>
        <p>The law lays out a firm timetable for every community to take part in an unfamiliar process, defined by code words ("quality," "barriers to opportunity," "student diversity") that can mean different things to different people.</p>
        <p>Republicans, who opposed the law in the General Assembly, intend to make it a central issue in next year's legislative elections, and are already distributing materials that sharply dispute its intent.</p>
        <p>In the end, whether any community takes part in magnet schools, or exchanges of students or teachers across district lines, or any other plan, remains up to each city or town, not the state.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Hasegawa's role is in many ways like that of a guide leading a large and prickly contingent of strangers through new territory. There is a deadline, there is a need for order, but the destination is uncertain and not his to decide. He can only point out features of the land that might help people decide where they want to end up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hasegawa, 49, has made his own journey through a diverse world. He grew up in a Japanese-American farm community in California, took part in civil-rights protests in the South, was inspired by black church leaders to attend divinity school, worked with street gangs in Boston, and eventually spent several years working and teaching in Japan, where as a fourth-generation American he learned the language of his great-grandfather.</p>
        <p>Having worked with Yale students of all backgrounds meeting people unlike themselves for the first time, hearing his 11-year-old son tell of unpleasant encounters in his suburban school in Woodbridge, Mr. Hasegawa says, "It's unnatural in Connecticut for us to have children in class with kids who are fundamentally different in color or ethnicity." 'A Common Interest'</p>
        <p>He says the essence of his new job is "the ability to create community, the ability to help people see that they have a common interest in this question of quality and diversity."</p>
        <p>"There are a lot of people who don't trust that the law means what it says," Mr. Hasegawa said, "who believe that somehow down the road their kids will have to be bused."</p>
        <p>"But the Commissioner of Education has said over and over, if busing comes, it will be the result of a local plan, or because people feel there is a better opportunity at the end of the bus ride, or because a court orders it. It will not come out of the department's planning process."</p>
        <p>A court order is a possibility because of a lawsuit known as Sheff v. O'Neill, which seeks to integrate Hartford's schools with those of 21 suburbs. Long-delayed final arguments are set for Dec. 16, and a decision by Superior Court Judge Harry Hammer is expected in the spring. Asking Local Boards</p>
        <p>The law calls on local school boards to appoint advisory committees and then propose what their communities could contribute to regional plans to improve and integrate public schools. Almost 80 percent of the students in Connecticut's cities are black or Hispanic, while most suburban districts are 90 percent to 95 percent white.</p>
        <p>Eleven regional forums will draft the plans, which the Commissioner of Education can comment on, but not reject. Approval is up to the school boards and governing bodies in the communities. Even then, towns can refuse to participate.</p>
        <p>The process officially begins in January, when the Institute for Public Service at the University of Connecticut will convene the forums. Mr. Hasegawa and the institute staff, however, are already deeply into their planning, knowing that the success of the process will depend greatly on how they start it off.</p>
        <p>"Every region will be free to do its own thing, but we'll have some suggestions on how to proceed," said the institute's director, Howard Rifkin. "We're going through this constant debate on how much guidance is too much and will be perceived as trying to force certain solutions."</p>
        <p>"I've been to a lot of meetings where people are trying to set up the us-against-them mentality," he said.  "I tell them, this is about you. It's not about the institute or the Department of Education defining anything." Italicized Options</p>
        <p>To build consensus, Mr. Hasegawa and Mr. Rifkin have consulted with several statewide groups on how to organize the process. In suggesting ways to proceed, or options for meeting a goal, Mr. Hasegawa said, "We find ourselves using things like italics, to say, "one possible way.' "</p>
        <p>In this month's school-board elections, the law did not appear to be an issue, said Terry P. Cassidy, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Boards of Education, which has conducted several meetings on the law for its members.</p>
        <p>"I haven't heard anyone say, 'We will not do this.' I haven't heard anyone say it's a bad idea. I've heard them all recognizing that we have to give every child a chance."</p>
        <p>What does concern school boards, Mr. Cassidy said, is how they will build support for the regional plans in their communities, and the unanswered question of whether the state will help pay for new schools, new programs or transportation that the plans propose.</p>
        <p>The Republican Party has already sent its legislators material for letters warning constituents that the law portends mandatory busing, regional tax districts and desegregation plans forced on towns.</p>
        <p>"It's not something that's of great concern to people at this moment, but I think this is the major issue for next year," said State Representative Daniel F. Caruso, a Republican from Fairfield who sent a mailing on the law to his district.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hasegawa's advice to those concerned about the law is to take part in the process. There will be advisory groups. All meetings will be open. There will be public hearings.</p>
        <p>"The fear is, isn't there a hidden agenda?" he said. "The right question should be, how can I be involved?"</p>
