        <p>House Republicans struck first today in what promises to be a divisive debate over welfare, unveiling a plan they called "tough love" to make welfare recipients spend 35 hours a week working off their benefits.</p>
        <p>With the White House drafting its own welfare proposals, the Republicans staked out a position that portrayed the nation's five million welfare families as an indolent lot in need of a moral tonic.</p>
        <p>"You can't maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies and 15-year-olds killing each other and 17-year-olds dying of AIDS," said Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the minority whip.</p>
        <p>The Republicans called the work proposal a compassionate idea that would give the downtrodden the incentive to change. But they also recognized that change would not come cheaply and they proposed spending up to $6 billion a year.</p>
        <p>They proposed raising the money by cutting food programs and barring immigrants from welfare assistance, provisions almost certain to be opposed by the Democrats.</p>
        <p>The plan offered a preview of the volatile politics likely to surround next year's debate, as advocacy groups leapt to denounce the plan's emphasis on personal morality rather than the weak state of the national economy. Accusation of Racism</p>
        <p>"It's racist," said Sonia Perez, a policy analyst at the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic advocacy group. She said the plan unfairly made immigrants targets and blamed minorities for high rates of single motherhood.</p>
        <p>The Administration reacted cautiously, issuing a statement pledging to work with Congress on a bipartisan basis. But Representative Harold E. Ford, Democrat of Tennessee, who heads a Ways and Means subcommittee with jurisdiction over the plan, dismissed it as "negative and punitive."</p>
        <p>President Clinton's pledge to impose a strict, two-year limit on welfare benefits was one of his most popular campaign themes and a large part of his claim to represent new Democratic thinking. But he has yet to specify what he has in mind.</p>
        <p>An Administration plan being written for release next winter is likely to be shorter on penalties and longer on the expansions of social services, like job training and child care.</p>
        <p>Distributing a series of Clinton campaign pledges on welfare, the Republicans warned they would attack any Democratic plan they found to be too permissive as backsliding.</p>
        <p>"I hope the President means what he says," said Representative Rick Santorum, Republican of Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>The handouts accompanying the Republican plan said the two fundamental causes of welfare were the high rates of out-of-wedlock births and the failure of welfare recipients to seek jobs. Many scholars say the shortage of remunerative jobs for people with few skills is a third factor. Two-Year Deadline</p>
        <p>Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, acknowledged that some regions had high unemployment but argued that even then "it doesn't mean that you don't have jobs."</p>
        <p>The Republican plan, endorsed by party leaders, would give welfare recipients up to two years to take advantage of the education and training programs that already exist.</p>
        <p>At the end of the two years, however, the mothers would have to work 35 hours a week to continue benefits.</p>
        <p>The plan envisions two kinds of work programs: community service at a public or nonprofit agency, or a job at a private business that receives a Government subsidy. But they would pay no wage other than the continuation of welfare benefits.</p>
        <p>States could end all benefits if recipients still had not found real jobs after three years on the work program.</p>
        <p>Parents who failed to comply would have their aid reduced, with three infractions resulting in the cessation of all cash assistance.</p>
        <p>The plan also seeks to increase child support collections and deny any cash assistance to a mother who fails to identify a father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Santorum and the bill's other sponsors argued that the work experience would enable welfare recipients to develop skills and resumes that would make them more appealing to potential employers. But research in the area is at best inconclusive.</p>
        <p>A recent report by the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, a nonprofit group, looked at past community work experiments and found "there is little evidence that unpaid work experience leads to consistent employment" or higher earnings.</p>
        <p>The Republicans tried to portray their bill as an expansion of opportunity to needy people. But they also portrayed welfare recipients in almost uniformly negative terms.</p>
        <p>"Some women on welfare are more consumed with the feeding of their drug habit than the gut instinct to feed their children," said Representative Nancy Johnson of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Gary Franks, Republican of Connecticut, who said he had relatives on welfare, talked of "taxpayer dollars going into the hands of drug dealers."</p>
