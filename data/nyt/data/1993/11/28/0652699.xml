        <p>Toys 'R' Us last week became the first national retailer to open a store in downtown Brooklyn in 15 years.

        <p>Toys 'R' Us last week became the first national retailer to open a store in downtown Brooklyn in 15 years. The store, in the Gallery mall at MetroTech on Fulton Mall, has been hailed as a major step in the area's revitalization program and is expected to serve as a magnet for other large retail chains.</p>
        <p>"This says to me that I can now go after those major retailers who have shied away from us in the past because none of them wanted to be the first to come here," said Robert W. Ohlerking, executive director of the Fulton Mall Improvement Association. "Now I can say, 'We have Toys 'R' Us.' "</p>
        <p>Toys 'R' Us will fill nearly one-third of the commercial space at the Gallery with two shopping floors and a third floor for storage. The Gallery, at the corner of DeKalb Avenue and Bond Street, was formerly the Albee Square Mall.</p>
        <p>MetroTech, a $1 billion commercial and academic complex developed by the Forest City Ratner Companies, has been the major factor in the downtown revitalization. Last August construction began on the sixth MetroTech building, a $55 million, 216,000-square-foot office complex that will house the Police Department's enhanced Public Safety Answering Center and the city's Computer and Data Communication Services Agency. The building, bounded by Tillary Street, Flatbush Avenue, Tech Place and Bridge Street, will have 1,150 workers and is expected to be completed by 1995.</p>
        <p>In addition, Joshua L. Muss, a developer, is seeking financing to build a $200 million, 31-story office tower with a six-floor Hilton Hotel directly across from MetroTech. It would be the first major hotel to open in Brooklyn since the 1930's.</p>
        <p>"Downtown Brooklyn is changing rapidly, and we hope to serve as a catalyst to bring other stores to the area," said Michael Miller, vice president of Toys 'R' Us, which is based in Paramus, N.J. "But while we're glad to help the city, this was also a very good move for us. We will now be able to reach a market that we were not reaching before."</p>
        <p>Forest City Ratner spent more than a year wooing the giant toy chain to downtown Brooklyn. Most of the chain's other stores are based in suburban malls. The Gallery outlet will be chain's third store in Brooklyn and ninth in the city. The company has 582 stores around the nation, and 47 of them in New Jersey and New York.</p>
        <p>"The Gallery is as much a part of the renaissance of downtown Brooklyn as MetroTech's gleaming new buildings," Brooklyn Borough President Howard Golden said. "By coming here, Toys 'R' Us has made an important investment that will pay off in more ways than just the bottom line." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY</p>
