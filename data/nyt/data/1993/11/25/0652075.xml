        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Authentic Catholics" by Anna Quindlen (column, Nov. 18) is a good example of why the United States bishops had to state clearly that Catholics for a Free Choice is not a Roman Catholic organization.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quindlen has apparently been persuaded by that organization's claim that support for abortion is as authentically Catholic as the church's clear and constant teaching that abortion is a grave moral wrong. She is apparently further persuaded that Catholics for a Free Choice has as much right to speak "for the church" as the Catholic bishops. For her, speaking "for the church" seems to mean reflecting popular opinion, rather than faithfully interpreting the truth found in divine revelation and a proper understanding of natural law. However, the truth is the truth, whether popular or not.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Authentic Catholics" by Anna Quindlen (column, Nov. 18) is a good example of why the United States bishops had to state clearly that Catholics for a Free Choice is not a Roman Catholic organization.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quindlen has apparently been persuaded by that organization's claim that support for abortion is as authentically Catholic as the church's clear and constant teaching that abortion is a grave moral wrong. She is apparently further persuaded that Catholics for a Free Choice has as much right to speak "for the church" as the Catholic bishops. For her, speaking "for the church" seems to mean reflecting popular opinion, rather than faithfully interpreting the truth found in divine revelation and a proper understanding of natural law. However, the truth is the truth, whether popular or not.</p>
        <p>Happily, with regard to abortion, the bishops speak for the church in both senses. The overwhelming majority of practicing Catholics are pro-life. The claims of Catholics for a Free Choice distort not only church teaching but also the true convictions of the parishioners who come to church week after week.</p>
        <p>As bishop of the country's largest diocese, as well as chairman of the Bishops' Conference Pro-Life Activities Secretariat, I can testify to that. I can also testify that Catholics expect their bishop to clear up the confusion created by the few Catholics who advocate abortion.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quindlen implies that the bishops, in saying Catholics for a Free Choice is not an authentic Catholic organization, are treating the name "Catholic" as a trademark. Yet it is Catholics for a Free Choice that uses "Catholic" in this way. Without it, they would be a tiny element in the pro-abortion lobby. With it, they can attract the interest of the mass media and claim attention they would not otherwise get for the opinions of an organization so small it does not even consider itself to have a membership.</p>
        <p>What secular organization would not protest the use of its name to propagate opinions contrary to its policies? The bishops can do no less when it comes to moral truth.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quindlen says that the bishops use innuendo by connecting Catholics for a Free Choice to pro-abortion organizations. This is not innuendo. Years of watching Catholics for a Free Choice work in tandem with groups that not only support abortion but that are often quite anti-Catholic in their tone have convinced the bishops that "choice" (meaning abortion) in their name is far more their concern than "Catholic."</p>
        <p>Lastly, Ms. Quindlen maintains that conservative organizations use "Catholic" without complaint from the bishops. The groups she names have not taken positions contrary to Catholic teaching. Were they to, or were an organization to arise, for example, with the name Catholics for White Supremacy, they too would be declared not authentically Catholic.
