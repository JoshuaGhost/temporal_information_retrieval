        <p>A 14-year-old youth shot and killed himself in the Bronx yesterday while playing Russian roulette with his stepfather's .357-caliber pistol, the police said.</p>
        <p>The teen-ager, Raymond Diaz, took his stepfather's unlicensed gun from a hall closet and unloaded six rounds, said Sgt. Frances Haimeck, a police spokeswoman. After reloading one round, he told his 11-year-old brother and three friends about a game called Russian roulette.</p>
        <p>"He put the gun to his head and fired it one time," Sergeant Haimeck said. "It only took one shot."</p>
        <p>His parents were shopping at the time and were unaware of the killing for hours, learning only when they returned to their their apartment on Wayne Avenue near Gun Hill Road in the Norwood section, she added.</p>
        <p>The stepfather, Catney Vazquez, was arrested and charged with gun possession and endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
        <p>The shooting took place about 1:25 P.M. The youth was taken to North Central Bronx Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
        <p>"I was shocked," said Gladys Cardova, a friend of the boy's family, after learning of the incident. "He was very good and polite, he wasn't in any gang or anything. This is a shame. A tragedy." She described him as "a bit chubby with a cheerful round face."</p>
