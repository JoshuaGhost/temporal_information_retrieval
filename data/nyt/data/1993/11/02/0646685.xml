        <p>Mitsubishi's ad agency yesterday confirmed a report about a reorganization of the company's account, while Toyota denied speculation in a trade publication that part of its accounts might go into review.</p>
        <p>Grey Advertising said it would establish an autonomous, full-service agency in Huntington Beach, Calif., called G2, to serve Mitsubishi Motor Cars of America. The account, and its estimated $100 million in billings, had been divided between Grey's offices in Huntington Beach and New York.</p>
        <p>Toni Lee, a Grey spokeswoman in New York, confirmed a report of the new boutique this week in Adweek. "We responded to changes in the automotive marketplace," she said, "that required that we would be able to move quicker creatively."</p>
        <p>David Stickles, executive vice president and creative director on the Mitsubishi account at Grey's New York office, will head the new shop as president. Bruce Ritchie, the executive vice president who headed Grey's Huntington Beach office, will be reassigned in the Grey network.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. denied a report this week in Adweek that a $90 million portion of its Toyota or Lexus accounts, currently handled by two Saatchi &amp; Saatchi agencies, had been placed in review.</p>
        <p>Fred Hammond, a Toyota spokesman in New York, said that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi DFS/Pacific in Torrance, Calif., would continue to handle Toyota factory and dealer advertising, with billings estimated at $300 million, while Team One in El Segundo, Calif., would still handle Toyota's Lexus luxury car account, with billings estimated at $150 million.</p>
        <p>Since Adweek and Advertising Age reported last month that a major automotive account was seeking a new agency, speculation as to which company has been rife. Mitsubishi was at one time mentioned, but Ms. Lee said the spinoff of G2 was in no way related to any client dissatisfaction with Grey's work.</p>
