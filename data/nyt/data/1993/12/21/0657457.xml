        <p>Marla Ann Maples, the daughter of Ann Ogletree and Stanley Maples, both of Dalton, Ga., was married last night at the Plaza Hotel to Donald John Trump, a son of Mary and Fred Trump of Jamaica Estates in Queens.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Marla Ann Maples, the daughter of Ann Ogletree and Stanley Maples, both of Dalton, Ga., was married last night at the Plaza Hotel to Donald John Trump, a son of Mary and Fred Trump of Jamaica Estates in Queens.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom's previous marriage ended in divorce.</p>
        <p>Dr. Arthur Caliandro of the Marble Collegiate Church performed the ceremony in the Grand Ballroom, on an altar decked with white orchids and white birches. Dripping from the birches were cut-glass teardrops.</p>
        <p>Other than that, as the writer Julie Baumgold remarked after the ceremony, "There wasn't a wet eye in the place."</p>
        <p>The bride is taking her husband's name. The bridegroom is keeping his name, The Donald, a legacy from his former wife, Ivana.</p>
        <p>Ivana Trump is keeping her cool on the ski slopes of Aspen.</p>
        <p>Covering the Trump-Maples nuptials, "an important personal moment in our lives," the couple said in a statement, were 17 television crews, a gush of gossip writers, and 90 paparazzi, including Ron Galella, who came out of semiretirement for the occasion.</p>
        <p>Among the 1,000 guests were faces from the worlds of politics, sports, business and show business. Mayor David N. Dinkins was there to toast the bridal couple along with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato; Alan G. Hevesi, the next Comptroller of New York City; United States Representative Charles B. Rangel; Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau and Percy Sutton.</p>
        <p>Soap opera queen Susan Lucci and performers Jerry Orbach, Rosie O'Donnell and Tommy Tune were working the room during cocktails, as were sports figures -- Evander Holyfield, Don King, Joe Frazier and O.J. Simpson.</p>
        <p>The ranking socialite was the bridegroom's sister-in-law Blaine Trump.</p>
        <p>But Sirio Maccioni, owner of Le Cirque, was there and perhaps a few of his customers: Alan C. Greenberg, chairman of Bear, Stearns &amp; Company; Arthur L. Liman, the lawyer; Ronald O. Perlman, the Revlon boss; Carl C. Icahn, the financier, and Adnan Khashoggi, the Saudi financier. Everyone had something to say about the wedding, which struck some people as sort of a royal wedding or what passes for one in New York.</p>
        <p>Glancing around the glittering hotel, Robin Leach of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous" fame, said: "This is the equivalent of Westminster Abbey tonight. It's Charles and Diana all over again. You know what happened with that."</p>
        <p>Howard Stern, the radio personality, dressed in his "Dracula look," purple shades and long dark velvet jacket, said: "It's probably in bad taste, but I give it four months."</p>
        <p>The hotelier Ian Schrager was impressed by the way Mr. Trump carried things off. "He looked like a real groom," he said. "So earnest.</p>
        <p>After the ceremony, the new Mr. and Mrs. Trump floated out of the ballroom and down the steps to the foyer of the Terrace Room, where reporters were waiting to shower them with questions and complimentary peanuts, no rice having been supplied.</p>
        <p>They were hungry, having been denied access to the ever-accessible real-estate tycoon and casino owner by his new publicity agent, Chen Sam, who busied herself arranging the bride's train.</p>
        <p>After he and his beaming bride dipped and kissed for the cameras for about 10 minutes, Mr. Trump allowed as how married life "feels great." Then, as hyper-beefy security cleared the way, the couple swept into the reception for Champagne, Beluga caviar and their first dance.</p>
        <p>It was, to use one of Mr. Trump's favorite words, a quality wedding.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Trump wore a low-cut sheath dress of white satin designed by Carolina Herrera. In the "something old, something new" tradition, she wore a $2-million diamond tiara borrowed from the jeweler Harry Winston. On the sensitive issue of the bride's shoes, the only detail given was the designer, Manolo Blahnik. (This was probably just as well.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump wore a tuxedo by Brioni. For guests who have yet to find the perfect wedding gift the places to look are Tiffany, Asprey and Cartier. The Trumps are registered at all three.</p>
        <p>And speaking of Tiffany, everyone inside the ballroom last night had heard about the recent birth of Tiffany Ariana Trump. And so, you might think, had everyone outside the ballroom.</p>
        <p>Yet events have been fast unfolding in recent days in the matter of Trump-Maples. And even yesterday afternoon, it was still possible to find people outside the Plaza who were somewhat in the dark.</p>
        <p>"They're getting married?" said Doris Weinstein, staring at police barricades outside the Plaza. "Did she have the baby yet?"</p>
        <p>Yes, she was told. The baby is 2 months old.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weinstein shook her head. "But Marla was just on television -- in a maternity outfit."</p>
        <p>True, but the outfit was part of a new line, Maternity Moods by Marla.</p>
        <p>"Oh," Weinstein said. "Well, give them my best."  VOWS</p>
