        <p>Hawks 105, Pistons 97</p>
        <p>The Atlanta Hawks won their 11th straight game, one shy of the franchise record, as Dominique Wilkins scored 20 points in a 105-97 victory last night in Auburn Hills, Mich., that extended the Detroit Pistons' losing streak to seven games.</p>
        <p>It is the Hawks' first 11-game winning string since the 1986-87 season. They won 12 in a row from Dec. 8, 1968, to Jan. 3, 1969 the team's first season in Atlanta after having moved from St. Louis. Jazz 113, Bullets 91</p>
        <p>Karl Malone had 27 points and 14 rebounds as Utah beat visiting Washington for its fifth straight victory and the Bullets' fifth consecutive loss.</p>
        <p>Tom Chambers added 24 points for the Jazz. He had 5 points during a 16-4 run as Utah pulled away from a 77-75 lead. SuperSonics 109, Spurs 107</p>
        <p>Gary Payton scored 25 points and visiting Seattle improved to 15-1, stopping San Antonio's eight-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>The Sonics won their fifth in a row and became the 13th team in National Basketball Association history to win 15 of its first 16 games. Seattle held the Spurs to 2 points in the first four minutes of overtime.</p>
        <p>David Robinson had 39 points and Dale Ellis 20 for the Spurs. Ricky Pierce added 24 for the Sonics. Celtics 129, Kings 115</p>
        <p>Sherman Douglas had a career-high 21 assists as Boston defeated Sacramento, the Kings' eighth straight loss and their 15th consecutive defeat at the Boston Garden. The Kings have not won in Boston since Jan. 17, 1979.</p>
        <p>Douglas, who also scored 18 points, tied Bob Cousy for the third-best passing game ever by a Celtic. Cousy had 21 assists against St. Louis in 1960. The only better assist totals were by Cousy (28) in 1959 and Nate Archibald (23) in 1982. 76ers 95, Bulls 88</p>
        <p>Dana Barros scored 6 of his 20 points in overtime and Shawn Bradley played the best game of his rookie season, helping Philadelphia beat Chicago at the Spectrum in Philadelphia. The 76ers snapped a four-game losing streak and stopped Chicago's four-game winning string.</p>
        <p>Bradley had 17 points, 10 rebounds and 6 blocked shots. Shooting only 30.8 percent from the field going into the game, Bradley made 7 of his first 12 before missing 5 of his last 6. Trail Blazers 114 Timberwolves 111</p>
        <p>Cliff Robinson scored 31 points and the Portland beat Minnesota in Minneapolis despite the best game of Isaiah Rider's brief professional career. Rider, the fifth pick in last June's draft, started in place of injured guard Doug West and scored 30 points, the most by a Minnesota player this season.</p>
        <p>Terry Porter had 25 points, including 6 of the last 7 points for the Blazers. Portland improved to 9-0 over the years in Minnesota. Clippers 100, Bucks 97</p>
        <p>Danny Manning scored 24 points before leaving on a stretcher with two minutes left because of severe leg cramps, and the visiting Los Angeles Clippers beat Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Manning, who had a career-high 43 points in Tuesday night's loss in Chicago, helped the Clippers overcome a 9-point lead in the fourth quarter. He could not continue because of his leg problems, but Los Angeles went on to the victory.</p>
