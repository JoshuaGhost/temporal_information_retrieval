        <p>Gunmen in troubled Natal province entered a squatter camp Thursday night and began shooting at random, killing eight people in an attack that the South African police attributed to a struggle between rival black factions.</p>
        <p>Four men died immediately in the attack outside Durban, and three women and an infant died later in a local hospital, the police said today.</p>
        <p>In a police videotape of the scene, the four-month-old baby was lying motionless on the ground after being shot with an automatic rifle. Four other people were seriously wounded.</p>
        <p>At least 37 people have been killed over the last week in Natal, an unusually high toll even for a region where politically motivated violence has been commonplace. Some commentators associate the surge in attacks to tensions over plans for South Africa's first elections open to all races.  Zulu Chief Challenges Council</p>
        <p>The violence coincides with efforts by Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party, to challenge a new council that will effectively oversee the running of the country until the elections, scheduled for April.</p>
        <p>Chief Buthelezi and an assortment of white supremacists, Afrikaner separatists and leaders of the so-called black homelands created under apartheid have rejected the legitimacy of the Transitional Executive Council and have demanded a larger role in talks on the country's future.</p>
        <p>Most of the country's political bargaining has centered on a dialogue between President F. W. de Klerk and leaders of the main black opposition group, the African National Congress. Rightists Stand to Gain</p>
        <p>If the bloodshed continues, some analysts say, the main beneficiaries might be right-wing whites who still favor apartheid and are seeking to undermine efforts by the Government and the A.N.C. to build confidence in the election process.</p>
        <p>In the Durban attack, Maj. Bela Naidoo of the police told the South African Press Association that three to five men had entered the Krishna Road squatter camp in Briardene, east of the Umgeni River, Thursday night and opened fire with AK-47 rifles.</p>
        <p>The police said the killings appear to be the result of a power struggle between rival political factions, but Major Naidoo would not say what factions were thought to be involved. Other officials said the police were investigating the possible involvement of rival groups within the A.N.C.  A.N.C. Official Killed</p>
        <p>In an earlier attack, Patford Musa Shuma, 41, a prominent A.N.C. official, was assassinated near the center of Johannesburg.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shuma was an aide to Cyril Ramaphosa, the secretary general of the congress. A police spokesman said Mr. Shuma was shot in the head at close range and that two black men were seen leaving the scene.</p>
        <p>The police were also investigating the derailment of two trains over the last 24 hours. An empty passenger train was derailed by the explosion of a land mine on a track in Soweto, a black township outside Johannesburg.</p>
        <p>Another train on the main Johannesburg-to-Cape Town line was derailed on Wednesday near the town of Orkney in the western Transvaal.</p>
