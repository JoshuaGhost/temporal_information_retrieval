        <p>Fernando Collor de Mello's hopes of rising from the political dead were dashed today when the Supreme Court upheld a decision barring the former President from holding elected office through 2000.</p>
        <p>A year ago Mr. Collor, the first elected President in 30 years, was forced to resign after he was charged with profiting from a multi-million dollar influence-peddling ring.</p>
        <p>The vote today eased a crisis that had provoked Brazil's military to break a vow of political silence and to question the state of democracy in Latin America's largest nation. The military ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985.</p>
        <p>"A dangerous and generalized loss of faith in the institutions and in their leaders" was how Gen. Benedito Onofre Bezerra Leonel, the Army's chief of staff, reacted last week to an initial tie vote by the Supreme Court on Mr. Collor's political future.</p>
        <p>Today the military is propping up Mr. Collor's weak successor, Itamar Franco. Increasingly unpopular, the President largely limits his appearances to military ceremonies.</p>
        <p>In a measure of military influence, Mr. Franco last week hastily abandoned a proposal to include military ministries in a plan to slash federal spending by 40 percent. The President said the military would be exempt from budget cuts in 1994.</p>
        <p>"The situation could become grave if Itamar does not take on his role as commander in chief," complained Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the most popular presidential candidate in all public opinion polls. Mr. da Silva has tried to build bridges to the military but has been hampered by suspicion of his Workers Party, which includes Marxists and former guerrillas.</p>
        <p>Preferring to wield influence behind the scenes, the military are publicly committed to democracy and to shepherding this troubled nation to presidential elections in the fall of 1994.</p>
        <p>But after only eight years of civilian rule, nostalgia for military rule is spreading. Corruption scandals are spreading through top levels of Government. Inflation is 37 percent a month.</p>
        <p>Asked if Brazilians should "elect a military president" next year, 49 percent of respondents to a poll in Rio last month said yes, 49 percent said no and 2 percent were undecided.</p>
        <p>Asked if "Congress should be closed," 46 percent said yes to poll takers from the Databrasil polling group. A slim majority -- 51 percent -- said no; the rest were undecided.</p>
        <p>The poll was released almost 25 years to the day after the military closed Congress, on Dec. 13, 1968.</p>
