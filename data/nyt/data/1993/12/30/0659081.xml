        <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury left London tonight on a long-planned tour of mostly Christian areas of the rebellious southern Sudan, defying a last-minute attempt by Khartoum's militant Islamic Government to place restrictions on his itinerary.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Archbishop, the Rev. Dr. George Carey, who is the spiritual head of the world's 70 million Anglicans, said he would curtail his trip by two days and abandon earlier plans to travel to the northern Sudan and to meet with officials in Khartoum.</p>
        <p>In proceeding with the trip, the Archbishop said he was going to the Sudan at the express invitation of Sudanese Anglican leaders, rather than as an official guest of the Khartoum Government.</p>
        <p>According to a spokeswoman for the church headquarters in London, the Sudanese Government sought this month to change the terms of his visit, even though his schedule had been arranged and cleared by Government officials last summer. Just before Christmas, she said, the Government told Dr. Carey that it would now prefer him to travel to the Sudan only as an official guest, "with consequent restraints on his program."</p>
        <p>But officials here said Dr. Carey was determined to keep his original itinerary, to show support for the Sudan's Anglicans and other Christians, in response to reports of growing repression by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the Islamic fundamentalist who came to power in a military coup in 1989.</p>
        <p>In remarks this week, Dr. Carey said, "I want to stand alongside all who are suffering, of whatever faith, and to show my support for aid agencies."</p>
        <p>Along with Roman Catholics, Anglicans make up the largest share of the Sudan's estimated 1.2 million Christians, most of whom live in the south.</p>
        <p>Dr. Carey has been in a running feud with President Bashir's Government over its treatment of Christians and Anglican officials in the Sudan.</p>
        <p>Rights groups have accused the Sudanese Government of obstructing the activities of the Christian churches, and of trying to convert southerners to Islam by force.</p>
        <p>Some Sudanese officials helped celebrate Christmas this year in the three main towns in the south, apparently in an attempt to dispel the impression that Government is anti-Christian.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, Dr. Carey said it was "a matter of great regret and concern to me that I am not now to visit the northern Sudan as I had hoped."</p>
        <p>He and his wife, Eileen, are to arrive in Nairobi, Kenya, Thursday, and then fly by private plane to Nimule, in the rebel-controlled southern Sudan.</p>
