        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Is It 1933 All Over Again?" (Op-Ed, Dec. 18) by Charles S. Maier examines the widespread correlation between Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's parliamentary success and Hitler's rise to power but suffers from geopolitical myopia.</p>
        <p>The commentary addresses the burgeoning anxieties of post-Soviet Ukraine, Finland and Eastern Europe, but dismisses the newly independent Central Asian region as having "virtually no realistic ways to defend." Granted that Professor Maier is from Harvard's Center for European Studies, but he overlooks Mr. Zhirinovsky's background and espousals of Russian revanchism.</p>
        <p>Let's read Mr. Zhirinovsky's mind. Hailing from Kazakhstan, east of the Urals, Vladimir Zhirinovsky is an ethnic Russian from the "Near Abroad," whose orientation to Moscow's manifest destiny veers southward rather than to the west. The noticeable outflow of Russians from Central Asia and the Caucasus form, in addition to imperial decline, the rationale behind Mr. Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist espousals. Fears of repression and second-class citizenry in these republics, along with the burden of such migration on a traumatized Russia, create the ideal scenario for discontent.</p>
        <p>Moscow's southern neighbors, especially Turkey and Pakistan, have more immediate cause to fear Mr. Zhirinovsky's rise than Europe. Mr. Zhirinovsky graduated from the University of Moscow's School of Oriental Studies and speaks Turkish fluently. Add to his dossier remarks about Russian troops ideally resting their feet in the Indian Ocean, and a historical analogy occurs -- Russia's perennial search for a year-round warm water outlet to call its own.</p>
        <p>Professor Maier is right when he states the "what is threatening and requires critical judgment by the Clinton Administration is the tightrope situation in Russia." Is extending the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to the Baltic states, Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics and Ukraine the proper response, as many avow, or a shortsighted Europhilic antidote?
