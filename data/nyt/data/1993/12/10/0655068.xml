        <p>Reacting both to polls that show Americans ever more fearful of violent crime and to Tuesday night's carnage on the Long Island Rail Road, the Clinton Administration today tentatively embraced a proposal to require all gun owners to be licensed.</p>
        <p>The plan, the details of which will not be settled for many weeks, was announced by Attorney General Janet Reno, who had been ordered by President Clinton to study the idea only on Wednesday. Other than signing the Brady bill mandating a waiting period for purchases of handguns and supporting a plan to restrict the sale of assault rifles, the President has so far moved cautiously on gun control.</p>
        <p>Despite the new polls and the shooting spree in which a gunman killed five passengers on the railroad and wounded 18 others, the political equation makes sweeping changes in gun laws perilous.  Message From Voters</p>
        <p>Recent elections have sent a cautionary message to the White House. Although there were other important issues that helped shape the outcomes in races in New Jersey and Virginia. In both states, the Democratic gubernatorial candidates, who supported strong gun control measures, were defeated by more conservative candidates. The Republicans had argued that the way to control crime was to impose longer prison sentences and abolish parole.</p>
        <p>Even though the National Rifle Association lost the Congressional fight last month over a waiting period for purchases of handguns, it remains a powerful force in Congress and warned that it would fight any attempts to pass other restrictions on handguns.</p>
        <p>With the White House facing difficult battles over welfare changes and monumental health care legislation, battles that will require compromises with moderate and conservative lawmakers, it is far from certain how committed the President will be to broad gun control measures when they are actually introduced in Congress. Clinton's Difficult Situation</p>
        <p>Still, the White House finds itself in the awkward position of looking for ways to show its toughness on violent crime by cracking down on the proliferation of guns without alienating those moderate and conservative lawmakers whose votes will be needed on health and welfare.</p>
        <p>The awkwardness was evident when the White House spokeswoman, Dee Dee Myers, described a session Mr. Clinton had today with mayors and police commissioners.</p>
        <p>She said: "What the President said was that the crime issue threatens the rest of his domestic agenda, that if we don't do something about crime it threatens health care reform, job creation and economic growth, welfare reform and a number of the other items that he believes are important.</p>
        <p>"So certainly, crime is at the forefront of his domestic agenda, but it works in conjunction with many of the other issues that he feels very strongly about, and he's going to certainly be talking about it and working with members of Congress, working with the local mayors and police chiefs and people around the country to try to do something about not only crime but the decaying social structure that is some of the underpinning causes of crime."</p>
        <p>In recent days, Ms. Reno, Mr. Clinton and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis Freeh, have all called for tighter control over weapons. In the meeting with mayors and police commissioners today, Mr. Clinton reaffirmed his commitment to support a ban on assault weapons.</p>
        <p>"I think we can do something," he told the group, without discussing specifics. "I think the American people are tired of hurting and tired of feeling insecure and tired of violence."  Role for States</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno said that the licensing system should be handled by the states, just as they issue drivers' licenses, and that the Justice Department was in the process of reviewing options.</p>
        <p>"I think it should be at least as hard to get a license to possess a gun as it is to drive an automobile," she said today at her weekly news conference. "I don't think somebody should have a gun unless they can demonstrate that they know how to safely and lawfully use it, that they're capable of safely and lawfully using it, and that they're willing to safely and lawfully use it."</p>
        <p>But Democratic legislators and their aides today expressed caution about Administration support for specific gun-control proposals. They noted that when separate versions of the crime bill passed the House and Senate last month, the White House and Justice Department were nowhere in sight. The two bills will have to be reconciled next year if they are to become law.</p>
        <p>A poll published today by The Los Angeles Times said that despite the adoption of the Brady bill, 64 percent of Americans think gun-control laws are not strong enough, while 7 percent say they are too strong and 24 percent find them adequate. The poll, taken of 1,612 adults nationwide, was conducted from Dec. 4 to Dec. 7 and its results have a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</p>
        <p>A study to be made public on Friday by the Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press found that 57 percent approved of the President's attempts to limit the use of handguns, while 29 percent disapproved.</p>
        <p>By a margin of 51 percent to 45 percent, they opposed a law to ban the sale of handguns, although 57 percent said controlling guns was more important than protecting the right to own guns. Still, only 41 percent of those polled thought stricter gun control laws would significantly reduce violent crime. The survey of 1,479 adults was conducted from Dec. 2 to Dec. 5 and had a margin of sampling error of 3 percentage points.</p>
        <p>Ten states, including New York and New Jersey, already require gun owners to have permits. An 11th state, Minnesota, requires either a permit or a seven-day waiting period.</p>
        <p>Ten days ago, Mr. Clinton signed the Brady bill, which imposes a waiting period of five business days for handgun purchases so that local law-enforcement authorities can check the background of the prospective buyer for evidence of a criminal past or mental instability. The bill was named for James S. Brady, the former White House press secretary who was wounded in the 1981 attempt to assassinate President Ronald Reagan.</p>
        <p>Supporters of gun control legislation said that it was only a first step and that its effect on controlling weapons would probably be limited. Push for Licensing</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Mr. Brady, joined by his wife Sarah and Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, announced his intention to push for new gun-control legislation next year. The measure would require all handgun buyers to get a license that would be issued after a background check. It would also limit purchases to one handgun a month and require the registration of all handguns, including used ones that are resold.</p>
        <p>A group from the Conference of Mayors presented Mr. Clinton with a report today that recommended gun registration, banning semiautomatic assault weapons, imposing waiting periods on purchases of all firearms and new taxes on weapons and ammunition.</p>
        <p>Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, today proposed that a 30 percent sales tax be imposed on handguns, assault weapons and ammunition for both. Under the proposed legislation, revenue from the tax and from a steep increase in Federal gun dealers' licensing fees would go toward health care costs. Under the plan, dealers would pay $3,000 for a three-year license.</p>
