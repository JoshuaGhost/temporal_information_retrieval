        <p>In his first major speech since the November election, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani called on New Yorkers yesterday to give more support to the city's police officers as he moves to redefine their role and asks them to be more aggressive about crime prevention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who made crime a centerpiece of his campaign, also repeated his calls for the death penalty and for a uniform Federal gun-licensing law in the wake of the Long Island Rail Road shootings on Tuesday. Asked by a questioner whether "in effect your proposal could lead to more New Yorkers having guns but these would be decent, well-trained New Yorkers?" he replied, "It could lead to that result, which would be a socially beneficial one."</p>

        <p>In his first major speech since the November election, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani called on New Yorkers yesterday to give more support to the city's police officers as he moves to redefine their role and asks them to be more aggressive about crime prevention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who made crime a centerpiece of his campaign, also repeated his calls for the death penalty and for a uniform Federal gun-licensing law in the wake of the Long Island Rail Road shootings on Tuesday. Asked by a questioner whether "in effect your proposal could lead to more New Yorkers having guns but these would be decent, well-trained New Yorkers?" he replied, "It could lead to that result, which would be a socially beneficial one."</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's comments about the police signaled a change in tone from his predecessor, David N. Dinkins, who had strained relations with the city police force, clashing over Mr. Dinkins's visit to the family of a man shot to death by the police who turned out to have been a convicted drug dealer, his support of an all-civilian board to review complaints against the police, and the conduct of off-duty officers during a raucous anti-Dinkins demonstration last year.</p>
        <p>"You can't ask police officers to stand on the street and prevent crime if you're not willing to support them," Mr. Giuliani said. "If you're not willing to say to them and to place into their minds and their hearts, because it is an exceedingly dangerous job, that if they take action in good faith, try to help you in order to prevent crime, that you're not going to turn on them if things get difficult."</p>
        <p>He made his comments in a speech and question-and-answer session sponsored by The New York Post and attended by more than 1,300 government officials, political figures and executives. Speaking not just of police issues, he said, "The single most important thing I believe we can do to turn around long term the problem of crime and deterioration is to give our children a better basic education."  To Consolidate Agencies</p>
        <p>With the city's fiscal problems, he said he would consolidate agencies, encourage retirements and reduce middle management. But he denied that New Yorkers would necessarily see reduced services, calling the government "so out of control and so bloated that there is no necessary connection between the number of people working at a particular function and the delivery of services."</p>
        <p>While shying away from layoffs, he said he would turn to them before tax increases. "If you ask me to choose between the two, New York City cannot have higher taxes," he said.</p>
        <p>After the forum Mr. Giuliani clarified his call for a gun-licensing law, which he said should require uniform gun training, background checks and frequent license renewals for gun owners. He said that what he believed would be "socially beneficial" was not an increase in gun owners but that gun licensing and training could result in fewer suicides and accidents with firearms. Licensing, he said, "isn't going to create more guns -- it may create somewhat more people who have a gun but in a regulated capacity."</p>
        <p>He said he did not believe it mattered whether a national law was more or less stringent than city licensing procedures. "Ninety percent of guns in New York City come from outside New York City, so we could have the strictest and best gun control and it wouldn't matter," he said.</p>
