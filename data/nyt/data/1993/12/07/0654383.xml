        <p>She has become part of the mythology of fashion, dominating the middle decades of this century. So it was altogether fitting and proper that the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art chose Diana Vreeland as the subject of its next exhibition, previewed last night. It will open to the public on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The exhibition captures some of the enthusiasms and style of the woman with craggy features and blue-black hair who served as an impresario of fashion from the mid-1930's until her death, in 1989, at age 86. She mesmerized designers as diverse as Bill Blass, Oscar de la Renta, Issey Miyake, Valentino, Gianni Versace and Arnold Scaasi.</p>
        <p>Her affinity for lacquer red and leopard spots influenced many of them. Her aphorisms, like "pink is the navy blue of India," which is inscribed in false marble at the entrance to the exhibition, were traded gleefully within the fashion industry. Shocking Reading</p>
        <p>Some of her most startling comments appeared in the column she wrote called "Why Don't You . . .," started in 1936, when she joined Harper's Bazaar. Some of her suggestions were especially astonishing then, in the midst of the Depression. "Why don't you . . . rinse your blond child's hair in dead champagne?" she wrote, or "have a furry elk-hide trunk for the back of your car?"</p>
        <p>She left Harper's Bazaar in 1962 to become editor in chief of Vogue, where she remained until 1971. The following year, at an age when most people could be expected to retire, she started a new career as special consultant to the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum. She brought to this job the same theatrical flair she had to editing fashion.</p>
        <p>She organized annual exhibitions, starting with a Balenciaga retrospective in 1973, the year after the designer's death. Some were devoted to a particular time, like the early decades of this century, or to a special place -- Russia, Hollywood, Austria-Hungary and China each had its season in the sun. The striking presentations as well as the clothes themselves drew crowds to the museum, not usual with clothing exhibitions. This popularity spurred other museums to give more importance to fashion and costume collections. Mrs. Vreeland not only showed clothes but also used the museum's resources for appropriate paintings, sculpture, artifacts and furniture.</p>
        <p>So there was plenty of material when Richard Martin, the curator, and Harold Koda, the associate curator of the Costume Institute, planned a show on Vreeland and her work. It is the third and most successful of the exhibitions planned by the curators who have inherited her mantle. But then, having such an exuberant subject, they could hardly miss. Four Themes</p>
        <p>They have divided the exhibition into four themes in her work. They call them "memory," "atavism," "exoticism" and "nature." A party scene, called "Improbable Affinities," draws together people and designers she admired. The group includes the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Felicia Bernstein, C. Z. Guest, Yves Saint Laurent and Barbra Streisand. Read the labels to tell who is who -- the mannequins are generic.</p>
        <p>How accurate are these conjectures? It hardly matters. The exhibition as a whole is a mad conglomeration of African tribal robes, a child with a pink flamingo, servants in livery, 1920's chemises and more, much more. Through this dazzling assemblage can be glimpsed, dimly, the fantastic woman who inspired it.</p>
        <p>She is perhaps best captured by a reproduction of a bulletin board in her office at Vogue filled with clippings of exotic people and subjects. Displayed on mannequins are two wool jersey dresses Vreeland wore. Both are simple in cut -- nothing exotic about them. She wore the beige overblouse dress by Hubert de Givenchy in the mid-1960's, the gray Chanel ensemble with the Peter Pan collar in the 1930's. Her day clothes were always simple -- she loved sweaters and pants; extravagance was reserved for evening.</p>
        <p>Fifteen panels of photo layouts she supervised from Vogue are among the most riveting parts of the show with their glorification of flowers, exotic places and personalities.</p>
        <p>A catalogue for the exhibition, which continues through March 20, includes a portfolio of photographs by Richard Avedon, Lord Snowden, Louise Dahl-Wolf and others; tributes by Blass, Miyake, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, de la Renta, Saint Laurent, Valentino and others, plus a study by Mr. Martin and Mr. Koda of the Vreeland museum exhibitions. The catalogue, $75, is likely to become a collector's item.</p>
        <p>In many ways, her life is linked to 20th-century fashion, especially its wilder side. "Vreeland invented the fashion editor," Avedon wrote. "Before her it was society ladies who put hats on other society editors."</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin said: "She turned fashion magazines into National Geographic. And she showed that beauty is not just Caucasian."</p>
        <p>In his tribute, Miyake wrote, "Diana always taught me that there are no boundaries for the imagination." And Versace said, "She will always be one of my heroes."</p>
        <p>The heroic age may be fading as fashion becomes more democratic and accessible, but the story of Vreeland's commitment provides a window on a more romantic time. The exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum is a tribute to that time and to one of the forces that shaped it. The spirit is not likely to return in the immediate future; the grandeur and imagination deserve attention.</p>
        <p>At least 560 people paid $900 each to preview the exhibition and to dine on caviar, chicken curry and "pomegranate Diana." The museum's annual benefit dinner drew 10 percent more people than last year, a tribute to the fascination Vreeland still holds, Mr. Martin said.</p>
