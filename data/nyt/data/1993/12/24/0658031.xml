        <p>Hardy Partiers</p>
        <p>NRBQ, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. It will be hard to find a better party anywhere. The band, whether it's New Year's Eve or not, take the idea of carnival, of excess and celebration, to the limit. They'll play a weird hybrid of country, jazz, blues and rock-and-roll, with the Beach Boys and Sun Ra thrown in for some surrealism. They'll be joined by Terrance Simien and his Mallet Playboys, a rocking Louisiana zydeco band. There are two shows: the first, at 7 P.M., costs $20; the second, at 11 P.M., costs $40 and includes a Champagne toast at midnight. Both shows have a two-drink minimum. PETER WATROUS Rhythm and Reggae</p>
        <p>Rosco Gordon, 200 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 638-2925. The pianist, singer and songwriter, best known for his rhythm-and-blues hits "No More Doggin' " and "Just a Little Bit," helped invent reggae in the late 1950's and early 1960's with his off-balance, syncopated sense of rhythm. Then he vanished, only to turn up over the last five years running a dry-cleaning business in Queens. He's a solid rhythm-and-blues performer, and a good pianist who has written some classic songs. He'll be joined by -- and this is a fine idea -- some members of the Skatalites, once Jamaica's finest studio band. The show starts at 11 P.M. There is a $10 cover and a $25 minimum. P. W. Classic Blues</p>
        <p>Jimmy Witherspoon, Fat Tuesday's, 190 Third Avenue, near 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 475-0049. One of the last of the great blues shouters will treat an audience to the classic stanzas of the blues. He can have a sweetness to his voice as well, and he's always ready to improvise on jazz standards, all of which will come with a blues nastiness to them. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. There is a $25 cover and a $10 minimum. P. W. Zanzibar Guitar</p>
        <p>Matt (Guitar) Murphy, Zanzibar, 73 Eighth Avenue, near 14th Street, West Village, (212) 924-9755. Before this guitarist was saddled with leading the Blues Brothers Band, from the movie of the same name, he was an exceptional blues guitarist who made James Cotton's mid-1970's band rock. He's all speed and texture, and he uses whirling lines that can cause a commotion. There are two sets, at 10:30 P.M. and 12:30 A.M. , and $75 gets you a four-course meal and Champagne, while $35 lets you stand at the bar. P. W. Time-Warped Tunes</p>
        <p>Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. Mr. White, a clarinetist, leads what may be the best New Orleans-style band in jazz. It's polyphonic, with tight ensemble parts giving way to the raucous group improvisations that bray and holler. He has become a New Year's tradition at the Vanguard, and hearing his band invites audiences into a time warp; it makes a listener understand why the music so quickly became the popular dance music of its era. There is a $40 cover and a $20 minimum. Sets are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. P. W. Piano Man</p>
        <p>John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. He's a florid pianist who always plays like he's never going to play again, and wants to get everything he knows in by the last chorus. He'll be backed by the bassist Santi Debriano and the drummer Victor Lewis, who is one of jazz's greatest living drummers. It will be interactive, a three-way musical conversation at its best. The show starts at 9, and for $120 there is a five-course dinner and Champagne. From 1 to 4 A.M., the cover is $20 and there is a $15 minimum. P. W. Two Wily Veterans</p>
        <p>Nancy Wilson and Gato Barbieri, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-0049. Ms. Wilson can be a viscerally moving performer, one of the best singers to graduate from Dinah Washington's vocal finishing school. She can be smooth or rough and nasal, and both stances imply emotion. Mr. Barbieri is a showman whose best recordings, made in the 1960's, have a hard power. The 7 P.M. show, for $180, includes a four-course meal and Champagne. At 1 A.M., the $120 tickets include breakfast and Champagne. P. W. Ulmer Power</p>
        <p>James Blood Ulmer, Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street, East Village, (212) 219-3055. This year is Mr. Ulmer's fifth New Year's Eve at the Knitting Factory, which sounds a bit like a tradition. The guitarist has recorded with everyone from Ornette Coleman to Art Blakey and Joe Henderson. His current music, which makes use of drones and odd tunings, is as distinct as anything that walks the planet. It's hard-rocking, slippery music, charged with power. Sets are at 9 and midnight, and the $20 cover buys a free drink and a Champagne toast. P. W. Dark Side Sounds</p>
        <p>Stephen Scott, Down Beat, 70 Grove Street, off Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 620-4000. Mr. Scott is the most austere pianist of his generation, somebody who plays the dark side of every tune. The music comes out moody and emotional. He's anything but glib, and his sense of space is wonderfully Monkish, elegant and relaxed, yet taut. He's a young master. There are three sets, at 9 and 11 P.M. and at 1 A.M. The $35 cover includes two drinks plus Champagne and party favors. P. W. Adderley's Band</p>
        <p>Nat Adderley, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. One of the best working bands in jazz features Mr. Adderley's cool sound on horn, and Vincent Herring's explosive soloing on alto and soprano saxophones. The rhythm section includes Rob Bargan on piano, Walter Booker on bass and Jimmy Cobb on drums and it swings with authority. It's mainstream jazz at its most exciting. The show starts at 9 P.M. and $99 includes dinner, Champagne and party favors. The late show, which starts at 1 A.M., has a $25 cover and a $25 minimum, and includes a Champagne toast. P. W. Trio at Zinno</p>
        <p>Junior Mance and Kirk Lightsey, Zinno, 126 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 924-5182. Mr. Mance, a bluesy, sophisticated pianist, will open with a solo set at 6 P.M. He'll be followed by a trio led by the pianist Kirk Lightsey and including Cecil McBee on bass and Marcus Belgrave on trumpet. The first show features a dinner, for $25.95. The second show, which starts at 8:30 P.M., costs $80 and includes dinner and Champagne. P. W. Visiones, in the Village</p>
        <p>Cecil Brooks 3d, Visiones, 125 Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-5576. Mr. Brooks, a good young drummer, always leads swinging bands, and this one includes the trumpeter Jack Walrath and the pianist James Weidman. Jeanie Bryson, a singer, will be on hand as well. Sets are at 8:30 and 11 P.M. and at 1:30 A.M. The first set has a $12 cover and a $10 minimum; the second, a $25 cover and a $10 minimum, and the 1:30 set has a $10 cover and $10 minimum. For $100, stay for three sets and have a full dinner and Champagne; $65 buys three sets, three drinks and a Champagne toast. P. W. Sharp in SoHo</p>
        <p>Elliott Sharp, Nick and Eddie, 203 Spring Street, at Sullivan Street, SoHo, (212) 219-9090. Mr. Sharp, a guitarist and fixture of the downtown experimental scene, will be leading a trio that shows his roots. From 9:30 to midnight, he'll be playing jazz standards. At midnight he'll start playing blues. The $75 ticket includes a four-course dinner and a Champagne toast. P. W.</p>
