        <p>Arturas Karnishovas, Seton Hall's pinpoint-accurate 3-point gunner, had not been so pinpoint going into tonight's game with Iona.</p>
        <p>But Karnishovas, the Pirates' leading scorer, was not worried about his 35 percent field goal shooting, his 34 percent from behind the 3-point line or even his 12 for his last 40 from the floor. "It's just not falling, but there is nothing wrong with my shot," he said after Seton Hall struggled to get past St. Bonaventure last Saturday.</p>

        <p>Arturas Karnishovas, Seton Hall's pinpoint-accurate 3-point gunner, had not been so pinpoint going into tonight's game with Iona.</p>
        <p>But Karnishovas, the Pirates' leading scorer, was not worried about his 35 percent field goal shooting, his 34 percent from behind the 3-point line or even his 12 for his last 40 from the floor. "It's just not falling, but there is nothing wrong with my shot," he said after Seton Hall struggled to get past St. Bonaventure last Saturday.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the shots fell -- and fell in droves. After missing his first two attempts at the Byrne Meadowlands Arena, Karnishovas suddenly caught fire. At one point he hit seven in a row, including five 3-pointers. He finished with 22 points in 22 minutes, missing the school 3-point record of seven by one, and lifted the Pirates to an 81-56 shellacking of the Gaels in front of an announced crowd of 11,345.</p>
        <p>"In past games, I had too many things on my mind," Karnishovas said. "Today, I relaxed more. My role's different this year. I have to play well and teams are paying a lot more attention to me than in previous years. But I can't stop shooting. If I do, I'll lose my confidence."</p>
        <p>His confidence should have been bolstered tonight. He was 8 of 13 in his point-a-minute performance, and he nailed 6 of his 9 attempts from beyond the 3-point line. Coach Had Confidence</p>
        <p>"I thought he would come around," said Coach P. J. Carlesimo. "It wasn't the mechanics with him. It was the type of shot that he was taking."</p>
        <p>The type of shots that he was taking tonight were the ones that go in. And he was not the only one. The Pirates, who improved to 3-2, hit almost 53 percent from the floor, compared with 37 percent previously this season. Iona hit only 30 percent. Darrell Mims contributed 15 points in 18 minutes and Seton Hall got scoring from all 11 of its players. Walk-ons Chris Morrison and John Yablonski got the first points of their careers.</p>
        <p>"This was the best all-around game that we've played," said Carlesimo.</p>
        <p>Iona (2-4), which never led and trailed by as many as 31, was paced by Mikkel Larsen and Rickey Rivers, who each scored 11 points.</p>
        <p>Karnishovas, who had connected on almost 51 percent of his field-goal attempts last season, missed those first two shots and then became automatic, scoring 10 points in a 12-0 run midway through the first half to give Seton Hall a 21-7 lead. The rout was on. By the time Karnishovas was taken out with 3:25 remaining, the 6-foot-9-inch senior forward had 19 points and the Hall had a 40-19 lead.</p>
        <p>Iona was simply overmatched. The Gaels, who lost their three top players to graduation and then saw their leading returning scorer, Terry Martin, go down for the year with a preseason knee injury, were threatening to go into the intermission with more turnovers than field goals until Carlesimo went to his bench. As it stood, Iona had 8 field goals and 8 turnovers and trailed by 44-21.</p>
        <p>The Gaels finished with 18 field goals and 15 turnovers. REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Seton Hall junior forward JOHN LEAHY broke the school record for consecutive free throws made when he sank two with just under 16 minutes left to give him 33 in a row. DARYLL WALKER had hit 32 straight in 1988-89. . . . Pirates point guard BRYAN CAVER only played 23 minutes after playing all but one against St. Bonaventure in DANNY HURLEY's absence.</p>
