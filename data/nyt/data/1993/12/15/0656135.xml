        <p>The former head of Salomon Inc.'s Government securities trading was sentenced yesterday to four months in a minimum-security prison for his role in the 1991 Treasury auction scandal.</p>
        <p>United States District Judge Pierre N. Leval also fined the former trader, Paul W. Mozer, $30,000. Mr. Mozer had faced a maximum 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine. The jail term is to begin on Jan. 18.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mozer's activities resulted in the Salomon Brothers Treasury auction scandal, which led ultimately to Salomon's paying a $290 million fine and the forced resignations of John Gutfreund, the chief executive, Thomas Strauss, the president, and John Meriwether, the vice chairman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mozer had admitted submitting two false bids in the Treasury's Feb. 21, 1991, auction of $9 billion in five-year notes. Salomon submitted one legitimate bid for $3.15 billion -- the 35 percent limit allowed by a single Government securities dealer. But, at Mr. Mozer's instruction, it also submitted two bids in the names of clients who had not authorized them so it could buy more than its legal share of Treasury securities.  Pleaded Guilty in September</p>
        <p>Mr. Mozer, 38, pleaded guilty in September to two felony counts of lying to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York by submitting the false bids. Although sentencing guidelines called for a 10-to-16-month term, Judge Leval said Mr. Mozer's "valuable cooperation" in testifying against others would result in a "significant reduction in the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed."</p>
        <p>He helped the United States Attorney, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service determine that Salomon had illegally taken $168 million in tax write-offs for "sham" trading losses.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Judge Leval last Thursday, the United States Attorney's office noted, however, that Mr. Mozer had declined to enter a standard cooperation agreement. The letter, signed by Acting United States Attorney Matthew E. Fishbein and two assistant United States attorneys, also said the Government had "reservations" about Mr. Mozer's denial of certain misconduct. Little Display of Emotion</p>
        <p>Mr. Mozer displayed little emotion at the sentencing, other than to fidget and take a drink of water after the judge said he did not agree with a probation report that recommended probation without jail. Although the report made an assumption that no loss could be determined as a result of Mr. Mozer's two admitted felonies, Judge Leval said he did not find that an acceptable conclusion. Mr. Mozer's crime was an "extremely foolish, arrogant, insouciant offense," he said.</p>
        <p>As his wife, parents and siblings looked on, Mr. Mozer said in a brief statement that he was "truly sorry" for having broken the rules. Although his lawyer, Stanley S. Arkin, asked that part of the sentence be served at home, Judge Leval declined.</p>
        <p>In explaining why he did not give a sentence of probation, the judge said that "in the world of financial crimes, deterrence of others is an extremely important aspect of sentencing."</p>
        <p>A Securities and Exchange Commission civil suit against Mr. Mozer and Thomas Murphy, a fellow Salomon executive, is still pending. It accuses Mr. Mozer of submitting false bids in Treasury auctions and of insider trading of his personal Salomon stock.</p>
