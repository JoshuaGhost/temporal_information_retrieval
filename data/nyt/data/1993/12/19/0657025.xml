        <p>China may still officially be a Communist country, but the law of supply and demand is being felt in its travel industry. With the number of visitors steadily rising in the last few years, the cost of visiting China has increased, in some cases by as much as 20 percent.</p>
        <p>This year a two-week tour offered by Chinasmith, a New York-based tour operator, cost about $3,840 a person, double occupancy.</p>
        <p>The price included air fare from the East Coast and hotel stays in Beijing, Xian, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guilin and Hong Kong. Howard Smith, a partner in the company, said the price would go up next year but he could not be sure how much.</p>
        <p>He said he hoped to keep the average increase to 10 percent, but will have to take a cut in profits to do so.</p>
        <p>"We have already been advised by tourist officials in China that internal air fares are expected to go up by 10 to 20 percent and that hotel rates will increase between 15 and 20 percent," he said.</p>
        <p>Hotel increases will be higher in the larger cities, he said, noting that some Beijing establishments with which his company has contracts have raised their low season rates by as much as 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Clarence Lu, president of Journey to the East in Flushing, Queens, also said he expected a 15 to 20 percent increase in hotel rates. A two-week bike tour in rural northern China this year cost about $3,400, including air fare from the East Coast; A similar tour next year will be at least $3,845 a person in double occupancy, Mr. Lu said. He said he was trying to keep the cost down by offering itineraries that included smaller, less expensive cities.</p>
        <p>Prices of some tours that were increased this year will be even higher next year. For example, a 15-day tour to southern China and Vietnam, offered by Discovery Tours of the American Museum of Natural History, will, in 1994, cost $6,980 a person in double occupancy, excluding international air fare.</p>
        <p>While that is only a $100 increase over this year's $6,890 tour, a similar trip in 1992 cost $5,990, also excluding air fare, said Susan Givens, director of the museum's tour division.</p>
        <p>American visitors to China numbered 300,862 in 1988, then fell to 214,956 after the Tiananmen Square massacre. In 1992 the number of American visitors was 346,300. In general, tourism is increasing at about 10 percent a year, but only a 5 percent yearly increase in hotel capacity is planned in the next five years.</p>
