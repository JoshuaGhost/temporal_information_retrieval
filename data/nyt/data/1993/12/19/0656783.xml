        <p>ETCHINGS OF VENICE</p>
        <p>Ugo Baracco may often be found at his stall along the Grand Canal in Venice near the Danieli Hotel, where he sits quietly while an associate negotiates sales of his etchings in summer. At other times of the year his work is exhibited in galleries in England, France, Japan and the United States. A selection of his etchings of Venice can be seen until Dec. 31 at Noel Fine Art in Eastchester.</p>

        <p>ETCHINGS OF VENICE</p>
        <p>Ugo Baracco may often be found at his stall along the Grand Canal in Venice near the Danieli Hotel, where he sits quietly while an associate negotiates sales of his etchings in summer. At other times of the year his work is exhibited in galleries in England, France, Japan and the United States. A selection of his etchings of Venice can be seen until Dec. 31 at Noel Fine Art in Eastchester.</p>
        <p>As a student in his native Padua and at the Academia delle Belle Arti in Venice, he was influenced by the Venetian masters Canaletto, Guardi and Piranesi. His etchings and aquatints reflect that influence in his attraction to architectural subjects and attention to detail. Because he uses an antique method of producing the numbered, limited-edition prints, coloring each plate individually and making the paper by hand, no two are exactly alike.</p>
        <p>Prices range from $330 to $750. The gallery, at 495 New Rochelle Road, is open Wednesdays through Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 6 P.M. or by appointment by calling 667-9175.</p>
        <p>CHILDREN'S CONCERT</p>
        <p>A free holiday concert for and mostly by children will be presented at 3 P.M. today at the Saunders School auditorium, 183 Palmer Road in Yonkers. The headliner is Michael Aloi, a pop singer and songwriter for many years who began entertaining children about two years ago. He will present some of the songs from his new "Kids World" album, including "Ants in Your Pants" and "Pizza Song."</p>
        <p>The Pan Band, a division of Youth Theater Interactions, a community-based performing-arts center in Yonkers, will perform the first half of the program. The young musicians receive their training on various instruments at the center. Among the most popular are steel drums, taught by Carlos Benjamin, which inject a Caribbean flavor into traditional holiday songs.</p>
        <p>TOY AND TRAIN SHOW</p>
        <p>The County Center in White Plains will attract antique toy collectors and model train buffs of all ages today during the Westchester Toy and Train Associates' 10th yearly show from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M.</p>
        <p>More than 400 vendors will display new, antique and used toys and trains, including wind-up tin toys, cast-iron banks, pressed-steel trucks, die-cast cars, tin soldiers, cast-iron floor trains, clockwork trains, steam-driven trains, electric and battery-operated trains, Lionel, Williams and K-line trains, Garden Railway trains, L.G.B.'s from Germany and Bachmann U.S.A. trains.</p>
        <p>Around the base of a 12-foot Christmas tree and across the stage, an intricate layout of tracks has been installed on which large-scale Garden Railway trains will be running all day.</p>
        <p>Santa Claus will be seated nearby for confidential chats with children, each of whom will receive a little pre-Christmas gift.</p>
        <p>Admission will be $6; free for children younger than 12. The County Center is at the junction of Central Avenue and the Bronx River Parkway. For more information, the number to call is 285-4050.</p>
        <p>MYSTERY DINNER THEATER</p>
        <p>The Days Inn in Elmsford has started an audience-participation mystery dinner theater with a murder mystery titled "Let's Kill the Boss." It will be presented on Fridays and Saturdays at 8 P.M. for an unspecified time by Mystery Cafe Inc., a Manhasset, L.I., theater group.</p>
        <p>Tickets at $36 cover a three-course dinner, tax, tip and the whodunit. Days Inn is at 200 Tarrytown Road.  The phone number for reservations and more information is (800) 376-2583.</p>
        <p>SONGS FOR WOMEN</p>
        <p>Canfei Ruach, a trio of women performing Israeli songs on a three-week concert tour of Connecticut and New Jersey, will make two appearances this week in Fairfield County. Canfei Ruach means Wings of the Spirit, and the program is subtitled Jewish Songs to Nourish a Woman's Soul. The trio sings in English and in Hebrew and does not admit men to the performances.</p>
        <p>The women will appear today at 3 P.M. at Young Israel of Westport, 420 Post Road West in Westport. Admission will be $18.50; $12 for students. Ticket availability may be checked by calling (203) 222-2209.</p>
        <p>The second concert is scheduled Wednesday at 8 P.M. at the Jewish Community Center, 301 Strawberry Hill Avenue in Stamford. Tickets are $18, and the phone numbers for reservations are (203) 348-2534 or (203) 325-3501.</p>
        <p>Wings of the Spirit is also the title of a audiotape produced by Pirtza Singer, the lead vocalist, composer and keyboardist of the group, and Michael Perry, the arranger. "Many of the songs draw inspiration from the texts of the Psalms and from the Torah," Ms. Singer said. "The music is a blend of folk -- after all, I was a child of the 60's in America -- and the classics, reflecting my early piano training."</p>
        <p>The other members of the trio are Nurit Avigdor, who plays the flute and sings Israeli songs in Hebrew, and Jane Shelly, a guitarist.</p>
        <p>The 32-minute tape can be purchased for about $10 at Riverdale Judaica in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.</p>
        <p>BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS</p>
        <p>Original art by eight illustrators of children's books will be on display at the Gallery of the Municipal Building in Hastings-on-Hudson through Jan. 30 in an exhibition titled "A Child's Garden of Art." In addition to contemporary art, there is a selection of vintage books, which parents will recall from their childhoods, illustrated by Arthur Rackham, Kate Greenaway, Howard Pyle and N. C. Wyeth.</p>
        <p>The exhibition is designed to highlight the importance of book illustrations as the first exposure to art that most children experience, and many special events are scheduled in conjunction with the show, featuring some of the artists.</p>
        <p>Informal one-hour slide shows and talks will be given at 4:30 P.M. by Diane deGroat today, Jerry Pinkney on Jan. 9 and Neil Waldman on Jan. 16. Ed Young is scheduled for Jan. 23, and Betsy Imershein will conduct a photography workshop on Jan. 15 from 10:30 to 11:30 A.M. The other artists are Susan Jeffers, Emily McCully and June Otani.</p>
        <p>Miriam Budin, president of the Westchester Storytellers Guild, will hold story hours for children on Dec. 29 and Jan. 5 from 3:30 to 4:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>The gallery is open Wednesdays through Sundays from noon to 5 P.M. Admission to the exhibition and special events is free. The number to call for more information is 478-4141.</p>
