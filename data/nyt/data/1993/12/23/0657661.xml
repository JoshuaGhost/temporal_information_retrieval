        <p>The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, said today that he would accept Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's offer to pay half the $9.2 million purchase price for Robins Island and now expected that the uninhabited 445-acre island would be jointly acquired as parkland by the state and county.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said the county will seek to act on its three-year-old contract to buy the island in a Federal bankruptcy court hearing in Westbury on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, said today that he would accept Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's offer to pay half the $9.2 million purchase price for Robins Island and now expected that the uninhabited 445-acre island would be jointly acquired as parkland by the state and county.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said the county will seek to act on its three-year-old contract to buy the island in a Federal bankruptcy court hearing in Westbury on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>However, a Wall Street financier, Louis Moore Bacon, said today through a spokesman that he would bid about $12 million at the hearing to buy the island and preserve it for his private use.</p>
        <p>The island, in Peconic Bay between the north and south forks of Long Island, has been mired in controversy since 1989, when the county agreed to buy it from the current owners, the Southold Development Corporation, for $9.2 million. Keeping Open Space</p>
        <p>The corporation, whose principals are Herbert and Claus Mittermayer, both German citizens, subsequently filed for bankruptcy, blocking the county from taking title.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney had previously supported a plan under which the county would allow a competing contract holder, the Robis Corporation, to buy the island for luxury housing while preserving more than 90 percent of it as open space.</p>
        <p>His support continued even after Governor Cuomo first offered to pay half the cost of a county purchase.</p>
        <p>But on Tuesday, as the county legislature debated whether to support the plan, Mr. Gaffney told the legislators that the Robis plan was "apparently nothing more than smoke and mirrors," and withdrew his support. A Missed Deadline</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said questions arose when Robis representatives failed to respond to county inquiries about a conservation easement and missed a court deadline for a $1.2 million downpayment on the island.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaffney said today that he now favored public acquisition unless another buyer emerged who was willing to offer the same terms Robis had. He said he met with Mr. Bacon's representatives earlier this week, and did not believe Mr. Bacon was prepared to match the Robis offer.</p>
        <p>James Kelly, a spokesman for Mr. Bacon, said Mr. Bacon, whom he described as a preservationist and sportsman, "is unconditionally committed to restoring and maintaining the island." He said Mr. Bacon, who is the president of Moore Capital Management, would discuss granting conservation easements and limited public access to the island following its purchase.</p>
