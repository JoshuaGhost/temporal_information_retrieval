        <p>It was originally formed as a networking group with a mission to increase the visibility of women business leaders. "Now, one of my goals is to make sure that this group involves itself in the business issues this country faces," Ms. Friedlander said. "We should be representing women's business interests in a nonpartisan way. I want to create more awareness in Washington of who we are." NADINE BROZAN</p>
