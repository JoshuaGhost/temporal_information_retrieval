        <p>On a surprise visit to Northern Ireland, Prime Minister John Major walked both the Catholic and Protestant streets of Belfast today to proselytize for the peace initiative that he started with the Irish Prime Minister a week ago.</p>
        <p>In an unusual foray for a British leader into the heart of the republican area of West Belfast, where murals and graffiti proclaim support for the Irish Republican Army's campaign to drive the British out, the Prime Minister challenged the political arm of the I.R.A. to take up the initiative.</p>
        <p>"There is a gauntlet down on the table," he said. "It is marked 'peace.' It is there for Sinn Fein to pick it up. The onus is on them."</p>
        <p>As he spoke, surrounded by rings of policemen and soldiers in full battle gear with weapons drawn, he stood in an industrial enterprise zone not far from Milltown Cemetery, which has a special section for the I.R.A. fallen. The most recent grave there is that of Thomas Begley, the 23-year-old "volunteer" who carried a bomb into a fish store on the Shankill Road two months ago, killing 10 people including himself.</p>
        <p>So tight was the security around the Prime Minister that few people on the street actually saw him. The reaction to his presence was subdued.</p>
        <p>From West Belfast he went to mainly Protestant East Belfast. He visited the Shorts aircraft factory, which has been attacked several times by the I.R.A., and was cheered when he took the controls of a riveting machine.</p>
        <p>At one point, as Mr. Major left City Hall, where he had met with the Lord Mayor and City Council leaders, he ran into an impromptu demonstration by die-hard Unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part of Britain and see the peace initiative as a sellout.</p>
        <p>Cedric Wilson, a former councillor from the Rev. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party, turned a protest poster into a paper dart and hurled it at Mr. Major, shouting: "You will live to regret this but the people of Northern Ireland will die regretting it! Shame on you!" He was ignored.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister's visit was intended to bring further pressure on Sinn Fein and its leader, Gerry Adams, to accept the declaration of principles announced last week by Mr. Major and Prime Minister Albert Reynolds of Ireland. Called "the Downing Street declaration," the overture is a set of general propositions that in theory all sides might accept as a framework for getting peace talks going.</p>
        <p>To soothe the fears of the Unionists, who come from the ranks of the Protestant majority, they include repeated pledges that there can be no change in Northern Ireland without the consent of most of its people. To hold out hopes for the Republicans, both among the Catholic minority in the north and in the Republic of Ireland, the document recognizes that a united Ireland can come about, provided that both the north and the south want it.</p>
        <p>As a condition for joining in the talks, the two Governments insist that the I.R.A. renounce violence for good. Behind the scenes, officials hope that the I.R.A.'s customary four-day Christmas cease-fire will simply go on. As a stick to go along with the carrot, both Dublin and London have threatened to crack down on the I.R.A. if the appeal is rejected.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A. is studying the declaration. A key question is whether the concessions to the principle of Irish unity and the prospects of being treated as a negotiating partner are enough of an inducement for its more radical fighters to lay down arms.</p>
        <p>One possible sign of opposition came on Sunday and Monday when bombs were set in Londonderry and Belfast, slightly wounding a soldier and a civilian. But trying to put an optimistic gloss on things, Government officials call this a "low level" of activity.</p>
        <p>In recent days Mr. Adams, the Sinn Fein leader who speaks on behalf of the I.R.A., has been trying to up the ante, demanding the release of all "political prisoners" and calling for unconditional talks with London and Dublin on the future of Ulster. His demands have been rejected out of hand, presenting him and the I.R.A. with a take-it-or-leave-it choice.</p>
