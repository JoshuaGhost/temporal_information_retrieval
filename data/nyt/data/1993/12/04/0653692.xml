        <p>Pablo Escobar is dead, gunned down by Colombian security forces as he fled a hideout in Medellin, his hometown and the base of his former international drug empire. The fugitive who once controlled by violence most of the hemisphere's cocaine traffic has himself died violently.</p>
        <p>Regrettably, however, the demise of one powerful drug lord will not bring much relief to societies victimized by the drug trade. Market control in cocaine has already passed to a cartel based in Cali, another Colombian city. Even if the suppliers' identities have changed, demand from users remains insatiable.</p>
        <p>Competition and revenge had almost as much to do with Mr. Escobar's fall as the paramilitary manhunt that finally caught him. Estranged business associates and competitors, along with other targets of his terror, formed People Persecuted by Escobar, a group of vigilante bands that helped track his whereabouts and punish his allies. The law was always several steps behind him, as it has routinely been with the drug trade generally.</p>
        <p>Still, the pursuit of Mr. Escobar was a worthy undertaking for a nation that has struggled, and often failed, to muster the will to stand up to its drug emperors. Colombia's credibility suffered deeply when officials appeased Mr. Escobar even as they briefly held him prisoner -- showering him with comforts, guards of his own choosing and even the equipment to carry on his criminal trade.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this conspicuous though limited success will revive Colombia's courage. For the United States and other narcotics-consuming countries, the removal of one drug monopolist can bring scant comfort. Instead it should bring a renewed realization that catching suppliers, while necessary, is no panacea. The other great need is to treat and reduce the numbers of those who demand the drugs.</p>
