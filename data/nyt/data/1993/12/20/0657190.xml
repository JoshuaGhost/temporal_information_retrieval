        <p>The discovery of 400 pounds of heroin in a luxurious Manhattan apartment tower this month, the authorities say, provided illuminating new insights into the workings of the nation's biggest drug market, including indications that they had underestimated both the volume of heroin pouring into New York City and the degree of involvement of traditional organized crime families.</p>
        <p>Before the capture of what the authorities described as a sophisticated European smuggler, with world-wide connections, investigators had believed that the New York heroin business was overwhelmingly controlled by Chinese, with some smuggling by Nigerians and an increasing amount by Colombians branching out from the cocaine business.</p>
        <p>But Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, says now that "clearly, a lot of traditional organized crime people are still involved."</p>
        <p>Besides seizing the 400 pounds of heroin, the largest amount ever by the New York Police Department, the authorities arrested scores of associates of the European and recovered $1.7 million in cash. Independents at Work</p>
        <p>Robert H. Silbering, New York City's Special Narcotics Prosecutor, said that while the European's relationship with other smuggling organizations was not yet entirely clear, the case suggested that "there are a lot of independent entrepreneurs working out there" beyond the previously identified smuggling organizations.</p>
        <p>"We knew there was a lot of heroin coming in," Mr. Silbering said, "but it now looks like there is even more than we thought."</p>
        <p>While investigators find these developments sobering, they say they are even more concerned about an explosion in heroin trafficking by the Colombian drug lords who already control the world's cocaine trade.</p>
        <p>For a quarter of a century, gangs from France and Italy, working closely with American organized crime families, supplied most of the heroin that flowed through New York. But a series of indictments appeared to crush the so-called French Connection in the 1970's and its successor, the Pizza Connection, was believed to have been destroyed in the mid-1980's, providing an opening for the rise of the Chinese traffickers.</p>
        <p>The new case, which is being prosecuted by Mr. Morgenthau's office, is forcing law-enforcement officials to re-examine those assumptions.</p>
        <p>Some of the 66 people indicted in the case may have been involved in the French Connection, a vast network of refiners, smugglers and distributors, 20 years ago, raising questions about whether that source of heroin was ever eliminated. Concentrating on Chinese</p>
        <p>Moreover, officials said that those arrested also included members of four of the five organized crime families in New York, the Luccheses, Genoveses, Gambinos and Bonannos, suggesting that they are much more important in the heroin trade than had been suspected.</p>
        <p>"We've been concentrating so much on the other groups such as the Chinese that maybe we tend to forget that organized crime is involved," Mr. Silbering said.</p>
        <p>The Colombians are believed to have made their first shipments of heroin to New York in 1991, investigators say, and are now beginning to challenge the Chinese traffickers in a market that supplies at least 200,000 addicts in New York and tens of thousands more in t the Eastern half of the United States.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, said Stephen H. Greene, the acting head of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Washington, the Colombian traffickers are prevailing upon their cocaine customers to add heroin under the threat of losing their supply of cocaine. "This is ominous," Mr. Greene said.</p>
        <p>Heroin is much more expensive than cocaine, selling wholesale for about $150,000 for a kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, in New York, compared with $19,500 for a kilogram of cocaine. Law-enforcement officials say there are probably twice as many heavy cocaine users as heroin addicts in New York. Complaints From Neighbors</p>
        <p>The police found their way to the European trafficker after two and a half years of investigation that began in response to complaints from a West Side block association about heroin dealers on Ninth Avenue between 46th and 50th Streets.</p>
        <p>They began tailing the European and arrested him on Nov. 17 shortly after he met another suspected trafficker on 72d Street and, the police say, walked off with a shoe box stuffed with $20,000 in cash. At first, the authorities say, the European identified himself as Gilbert Barbe, 48, a Parisian diamond trader.</p>
        <p>Later, he said he was in the furniture business and investigators found papers showing that he sometimes used the name Joel Guichard. Nearly two weeks after his arrest, Mr. Morgenthau said, "We're not sure of his real name" or whether he is French or Belgian, or something else.</p>
        <p>Seemingly confident, the suspect agreed to go back to his studio apartment on Central Park West with the police to let them look around. In the apartment, the police said, they found papers that led them to a warehouse in Maspeth, Queens, and to two huge tractor-trailer vans with false bottoms that had been used for smuggling heroin and money. On another visit to the apartment on Dec. 6, the police said, they discovered the 400 pounds of heroin in five suitcases. An International Trail</p>
        <p>Daniel J. Castleman, the chief of the investigations division in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said the smuggling scheme ranged from New York and Paris, through Russia, Thailand and Singapore.</p>
        <p>The trailers were either built or modified in Kiev -- not Moscow, as had originally been believed; shipped to Thailand, where they were packed with heroin, and then forwarded to Singapore. In Singapore the trailers were filled with rattan furniture, to give the appearance of legitimacy, and dispatched to the Port of Newark, Mr. Castleman said.</p>
        <p>Markings on the heroin packets indicate that the drugs came from the same source as most of the heroin brought to New York by Chinese traffickers. But in contrast to the Chinese, who deal in heroin through a series of independent brokers and smugglers, the European oversaw the movement of the drug every step of the way from Thailand until it was doled out to distributors in New York, much as the Colombians operate, the authorities say.</p>
        <p>Until now, the authorities had believed that the Mafia was no longer involved in shipping heroin to New York, but bought the drug from Chinese brokers in the city and limited themselves to distributing it to dealers, as do many Dominican, Jamaican and black American gangs.</p>
        <p>"This is a major new source of supply," Mr. Castleman said.</p>
        <p>As a measure of the appetite of the New York market, drug experts calculated that the 400 pounds would probably be less than a month's supply for the city.</p>
        <p>Unlike most other traffickers, the authorities say, the European did not deliver his heroin in large quantities. Instead, they say, perhaps to keep from depressing prices, he parceled it out in 12-ounce packets, one, two or three at a time.</p>
        <p>"This was a very substantial operation," Mr. Morgenthau said. "And this fellow was extremely skillful."</p>
