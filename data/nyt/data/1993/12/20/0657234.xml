        <p>Something funny happened not on the way to but inside City Center when the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performed a classic by Jerome Robbins for the first time on Friday night.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Robbins created the premiere of "N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz" in 1958 for the first Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, the ballet caused an utter sensation.

        <p>Something funny happened not on the way to but inside City Center when the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater performed a classic by Jerome Robbins for the first time on Friday night.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Robbins created the premiere of "N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz" in 1958 for the first Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy, the ballet caused an utter sensation. Choreographers all over the world began to imitate Mr. Robbins's finger-snapping jazz-propelled dancers, who had seemingly burst out of "West Side Story," the choreographer's Broadway show of the year before.</p>
        <p>Like so many genuine innovators, Mr. Robbins can occasionally be a victim of his own ground-breaking success. In 1993 this meticulously staged Ailey Company premiere at City Center (131 West 55th Street, Manhattan) left some in the audience complaining that they had seen it all before. Precisely. It takes a pioneer to create his own cliches.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Robbins did so brilliantly was to capture the mood of urban America in the late 1950's. Gang warfare, alienated youth: these phrases may not seem new today but Mr. Robbins envisaged them in startling images and he did so by incorporating the symbolic rhythms of vernacular dance into the formal structures of ballet. No one has been able to distill the American passing mood as sharply as he has done in so many of his works.</p>
        <p>"N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz" is not a picaresque invention about street life and young people with little future. Anyone who grew up in the 1950's in New York will recognize these dancers in sneakers rather than toe shoes, who move with an understated cool that hides a repressed fury.</p>
        <p>"N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz" is not a literal piece of dance theater. In this genre, Mr. Robbins is more American than Americana. There is no open frontier with optimistic cowboys on his horizon. But there is a sure grasp of street dance incorporated into classical forms. Ben Shahn's backdrop -- television aerials, tenement rooftops and a handball court -- distills the urban landscape. Mr. Robbins is more abstract, allowing pure dance patterns to convey essential emotions.</p>
        <p>Then why did this revival seem like a period piece rather than the vibrant and universal production it has been in the past? The reason may be that the work was choreographed originally for professional ballet dancers, Mr. Robbins's own short-lived troupe, Ballets: U.S.A. (1958-62).</p>
        <p>Until now, Mr. Robbins has allowed the work to be performed only by ballet companies: the Harkness Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and American Ballet Theater.</p>
        <p>Although the Ailey dancers take ballet class, they are members of a modern-dance troupe. If anything they approach the choreography here too carefully and too reverently. They strive for the precision that Mr. Robbins demands but do not quite achieve the freedom that experienced ballet dancers would find more easily, especially in the partnered lifts.</p>
        <p>That is the tricky thing about Robbins's contemporary distillations of the American scene. The choreography may look like show dancing because it uses jazz-tinged music, in this case by Robert Prince. But the full dance values in such choreography rely on secure ballet technique.</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly the Ailey Company will eventually let loose with characteristic exuberance. Already Dwight Rhoden and Elizabeth Roxas in the blues duet, "Passage for Two," captured its moment of bleak and fleeting passion.</p>
        <p>Oddly, the most violent episode in which a woman is thrown into the wings (off a roof) after an implied gang rape, looks obscure. No longer politically correct, this vignette shows the teen-aged girl "asking for it." Dana Hash seemed too mature for the role and while dancing well, Andre Tyson, Tracy Inman, Mr. Rhoden, Matthew Rushing and Duane Cyrus were a tad cautious.</p>
        <p>Wilma Curley and Edward Verso staged the revival under Mr. Robbins's supervision with Jennifer Tipton providing the ever-nuanced lighting. "Hymn" and "The Winter in Lisbon," both vibrantly danced, completed the program.</p>
