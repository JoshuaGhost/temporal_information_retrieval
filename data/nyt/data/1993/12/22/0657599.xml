        <p>A toxicology report has apparently exonerated the driver who injured Sacramento Kings guard Bobby Hurley in a car accident 10 days ago.</p>
        <p>According to a police spokesman yesterday, Daniel Wieland, the driver, was found to have only traces of methamphetamine, which is commonly known as speed, in his urine but not in his blood on the night of the accident. As a result, he was not expected to be charged with a felony count of driving under the influence of drugs.</p>
        <p>Wieland, in a telephone interview from his hospital bed, said he was merely guilty of swallowing cold pills.</p>
        <p>"They found what they claimed to be methamphetamine, but it wasn't," said Wieland, a 37-year-old house painter. "What that was probably was cold medicine. I'm not saying I'm an angel, but I wasn't using anything. But, yes, I had a cough I couldn't shake. I'd been taking every over-the-counter medicine I could think of. I've been taking them by the, well, I took too many, probably. I took them up to that day." More Tests by the Police</p>
        <p>Hours after the accident on Dec. 12, when Wieland's 1970 Buick station wagon collided with Hurley's light truck, Wieland tested positive for amphetamine at the hospital, the police said. His blood and urine samples were then retested by the police, but no traces of drugs were found in his blood, according to the police spokesman, Michael Heenan.</p>
        <p>"It stays in urine a lot longer, which means it was in his system for probably several days," Heenan said yesterday. "That means he wasn't driving under the influence that night."</p>
        <p>It is ultimately up to the Sacramento District Attorney's office whether to file a charge against Wieland, but police officials expect he will be ticketed only for driving without headlights.</p>
        <p>According to Hurley and three eyewitnesses, Wieland was driving with only one dim parking light the night of Dec. 12 when he crashed at 55 miles an hour into Hurley's Toyota 4Runner. Hurley suffered a life-threatening pulmonary injury, fractured ribs, a torn knee ligament, collapsed lungs, a fractured shoulder blade and a compression fracture in his lower back. Wieland suffered a broken bone in his leg. 'Perhaps My Lights Blinked Out'</p>
        <p>Mechanical tests by the police indicate that Wieland's station wagon had functioning headlights. But because of the damage done to the car, there is no way of knowing whether or not his headlight malfunctioned.</p>
        <p>"Perhaps my lights blinked out," Wieland said yesterday, "but last I remember, the headlights were on."</p>
        <p>Wieland and Hurley, meanwhile, are neighbors at University of California-Davis Medical Center. Their rooms are only a floor apart, and Wieland said he recently sent Hurley a card.</p>
        <p>"No apologies on either side are necessary," Wieland said. "He's a superstar, but so am I. I mean, I don't play anything, no sports or anything, but I'm happy to be alive. He was saved, and so was I. What'd I say in the card? That's personal. But he said some nice things about me later, I hear. We're two human beings. And, you know, Bobby's great fans have written letters giving me support. They say it's easy to look at me as the underdog, but they're on my side, too."</p>
