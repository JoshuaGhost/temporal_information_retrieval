        <p>WHEN analysts recently turned bullish on three companies, it was just the tonic the stocks needed. But investors were forgetting a cardinal rule: always discount bullish reports from analysts who work for a company's investment bank.</p>
        <p>Strong earnings lifted shares of Barnes &amp; Noble 25 cents on Nov. 23, but it took a buy recommendation a day later from Morgan Stanley, which underwrote the bookseller's initial public offering in September, to send the shares up $2.50, to $27.375.</p>
        <p>Health Maintenance Systems Inc. jumped $2.25, to $20.75, on Nov. 30, thanks to a buy recommendation that day by Merrill Lynch, the company's underwriter.</p>
        <p>Less clear cut is the case of Bed, Bath and Beyond, a red-hot retailer Goldman, Sachs took public in February. On Nov. 19, Goldman upgraded it to a moderate outperformer, lifting the shares 50 cents and perhaps fueling a rally in the following weeks.</p>
        <p>If an underwriter's analysts have something bad to say about a client, that might be worth listening to. STEPHANIE STROM</p>
