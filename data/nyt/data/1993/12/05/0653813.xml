        <p>DOUGLAS MAXWELL, curator of "Timely and Timeless" at the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield, is an adjunct professor of contemporary art at New York University. He is also a practicing psychoanalyst who teaches at the Training Institute of the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis and the Institute for Expression Analysis. And he is the arts editor of Psychoanalytic Review.</p>
        <p>This combination of disciplines, though formidable, is not without precedent. Hans Prinzhorn who, in the late 1920's, built the collection of art by the insane that bears his name at the University of Heidelberg, and who wrote a book on the subject, was both psychiatrist and art historian. In addition to influencing the course of Modernism, Prinzhorn's findings show that many of the esthetic achievements of the demented, unsedated and untutored were not only comparable with those of professionals but were also quite often ahead of their time. Incidentally, it is not unlikely that Adolf Hitler was influenced by the collection and its exegesis in his attempt to root out "degenerate art."</p>

        <p>This combination of disciplines, though formidable, is not without precedent. Hans Prinzhorn who, in the late 1920's, built the collection of art by the insane that bears his name at the University of Heidelberg, and who wrote a book on the subject, was both psychiatrist and art historian. In addition to influencing the course of Modernism, Prinzhorn's findings show that many of the esthetic achievements of the demented, unsedated and untutored were not only comparable with those of professionals but were also quite often ahead of their time. Incidentally, it is not unlikely that Adolf Hitler was influenced by the collection and its exegesis in his attempt to root out "degenerate art."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Maxwell is an optimist. While others -- artists or critics -- may feel the end of art, if not the world, is nigh, he contends that such pessimism is unfounded. And he aims to prove it with contemporary paintings that do not focus on the ills of society, thus reflecting what he calls the "obsessive cultural imperative for instant gratification and quick fixes." On the contrary, they provide, Mr. Maxwell says, "hope for the future by pointing to the continuing tradition of painting" and asserting "its relevance and vitality."</p>
        <p>Positivism was never so ingeniously served as it is in this show. There is no sign of special pleading, no attempt to drain the viewers' sympathies, nothing the least bit hortatory and, best of all, there are no words. Still, that does not mean the curator has been reduced to American Impressionism or Norman Rockwell. He has nevertheless chosen works that are politically inert, although, with changed titles, one or two could scrape by in an environmental show. For instance, there is something dreadfully wrong about an ecosystem that permits an armadillo to mount a tortoise while, below ground, a fox curls up in a burrow from which there is no escape. This is the situation in the Surrealist "Biosphere V," by Alexis Rockman. But Mr. Maxwell, like the Book of Revelation, takes the long view, saying that "after the apocalypse there could follow a whole new evolutionary world and new world order."</p>
        <p>The curator also sees a trace of the apocalyptic in Mark Innerst's small canvases, one of which, amusingly enough, makes of Venice a barely perceptible line of buildings on the horizon, while another features a broken classical column with garlands standing among foliage.</p>
        <p>Unless it is in the very effort to rescue art from the executioner, the "Timely" is hard to locate. Timelessness, however, can be read into many works. Some of these aspire to primitivism -- such as the poorly drawn horse that Susan Rothenberg made her logo in the 1970's (the example here is a brown-black silhouette against pink). Others fall into the category of Surrealism -- Maria Tomasula's seemingly artificial pink rose sprouting from the roots of an upside-down bush that is framed by a proscenium of purple drapery and theatrically lighted. Still others qualify as Magic Realism, notably "La Zingera," the equally stagy portrait by Deborah Deichler of a fashionable young woman kneeling in a semicircle of Tarot cards.</p>
        <p>Although all interpretations of contemporary art are to some degree subjective, Mr. Maxwell may take his viewers farther than they care to go. For instance, where some might see touches of Marsden Hartley and Albert Pinkham Ryder in Tobi Kahn's arch of dark gray rock over a pink sea, the curator discerns the cliffs of Etretat, made famous by Monet, and the biomorphism of William Baziotes. The problem becomes more acute when the subject is the artfully unfinished figure compositions of Peter Solow, one of which seems to include a firing squad. For Mr. Maxwell, this "implies the possibility of some kind of private violence or torment"; to this observer, the canvas suggests an artist unwilling to forgo the spontaneity of a preliminary sketch. One marvels, also, at the curator's view of the indefatigable inventiveness in Elizabeth Murray's abstractions as "a positive assertiveness of her power as an artist."</p>
        <p>Like the notion of a newspaper printing only good news, Mr. Maxwell's cheeriness wears thin. Still, he holds the floor (three of them in fact) and if he does not persuade all the visitors to the Aldrich Museum of the contemporary scene's silver lining, he is certain to get most of them talking -- about art. The exhibition is on view through Jan. 9.</p>
