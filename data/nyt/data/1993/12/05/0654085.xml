        <p>A man driving an illegal livery van on a Brooklyn street was shot to death on Friday night in front of four other passengers in what the police said was the first shooting involving the unlicensed vans, which have proliferated on city streets in recent years.</p>
        <p>The shooting of the driver, Frank James, 45, comes as the police struggle to stop a seemingly unending series of killings of cabdrivers. But unlike the 41 cabby killings this year, the shooting Friday night happened in front of several passengers who were also held up by the gunman.</p>
        <p>A police spokesman, Sgt. Anthony Barlanti, said the gunman got into Mr. James's Ford Econoline van at Avenue P off Flatbush Avenue, pulled a gun and told the passengers to put their heads down. As the van drove south on Flatbush Avenue, the gunman ordered the driver to turn off the main road to East 26th Street, where he robbed the passengers. He hit one with the butt of the gun and then shot the driver in the head, Sergeant Barlanti said.</p>
        <p>The sergeant said there was no apparent motive for the shooting and no indication that the driver had put up a struggle. Two passengers fled on foot as the others ran to a nearby home and called the police. The gunman was still at large. Immigrant's Part-Time Job</p>
        <p>Mr. James's vehicle was one of the hundreds of illegal vans that offer commuters low-cost rides, often from subway stops to residential areas.</p>
        <p>Like many of the slain cabbies, Mr. James was an immigrant, having come from Guyana 14 years ago. He worked as a pest-control worker at Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, and drove the van part time to earn extra money, Sergeant Barlanti said.</p>
        <p>A father of two children, Mr. James had recently moved with his family from Flatbush to the second floor of a two-story brick building along a residential street in Cypress Hills.</p>
        <p>"They were just a normal family with two kids and now they don't have a father," said Lystra Gaddy, 35, a next-door neighbor of the family. "It's very sad."</p>
        <p>Michelle Casimir, a neighbor, said she was watching television when Mr. James's wife, Kathleen, 26, came running down to her apartment after hearing that her husband had been shot. "She was crying and sobbing," Ms. Casimir said.</p>
        <p>At the house where the robbery victims fled after the shooting, a resident said that the passengers came to her door knocking and screaming for her to call the police.</p>
        <p>"At first I thought it was a prank," she said. "As soon as I saw the blood I told my husband to go open the door."</p>
        <p>Although the police said Mr. James was apparently the first unlicensed van driver to be killed, it was not the first time passengers have been held up. One morning last July, three young men, two of them armed with guns, held up a city bus, terrorizing and robbing 22 passengers. Although the bandits fired some shots into the roof of the bus, there were no serious injuries and the thieves escaped with $300 in cash and jewelry. A Popular Service</p>
        <p>The illegal vans first appeared in the Bronx in the early 1970's and quickly spread to Brooklyn and Queens, providing something the official transit system largely did not: fast service into Manhattan or between outlying areas and subway stops.</p>
        <p>The vans, many with frosted glass and comfortable seats, have become so popular along some city bus routes that the Transit Authority estimates that it loses about $30 million a year, or 7 percent of revenues because of the vans.</p>
        <p>The loss of riders has caused the Transit Authority to drastically reduce service along six heavily affected routes in Brooklyn and Queens. And the service cuts, in turn, have prompted still more people to turn to the vans.</p>
        <p>Despite the popularity of the unlicensed vans, Friday's incident underscores the risk that passengers face when they ride the unregulated vehicles.</p>
        <p>Haji Shasique, a shopkeeper at K &amp; A Grocery on Flatbush Avenue, near where the shooting occurred, said that about three months ago, a woman was robbed nearby at gunpoint by a group of teenagers on one of the vans. Mr. Shasique said the youths jumped off the van as it pulled to a corner.</p>
        <p>"Nobody is safe on the bus or in the van," he said. "But at least the bus has insurance and the van has no insurance." 'Anything Can Happen'</p>
        <p>Josephine Saunders, a resident of Crown Heights, said she does not ride the unlicensed vans.</p>
        <p>"You don't know the driver and anything can happen," Ms. Saunders said. "Even if you take the bus and get robbed on the bus it's better."</p>
        <p>Yesterday, at the corner of Flatbush and Foster Avenues, more than a dozen vans full of passengers drove by in less than 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>" I know it's very dangerous, but the bus has many problems," Sandra Desir, a native of Haiti, said as she got off a van. "The van is faster."</p>
