        <p>First it was the patients at Gouverneur Hospital, then the recovering drug addicts at the Lower East Side Service Center, who have had the best river views around. But over time the internal views at 7 Gouverneur Slip -- the 50,000-square-foot masonry structure abutting the FDR Drive in lower Manhattan and designed by Mc Kim, Mead &amp; White in 1914 -- have grown a lot less esthetic. Crumbling plaster, floors worn down to the concrete, leaky ceilings, all were part of the interior landscape.</p>
        <p>Now residents and staff will get the best of both worlds. The New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services has come through with $5 million to renovate the 145-bed facility, which houses both long-term and short-term substance-abuse treatment programs. Wiring, windows, kitchens, plumbing, air-conditioning -- pretty much everything will be new, according to the architect Jack Esterson, whose firm, Thanhauser &amp; Esterson, is doing the redesign.</p>

Wiring, windows, kitchens, plumbing, air-conditioning -- pretty much everything will be new, according to the architect Jack Esterson, whose firm, Thanhauser &amp; Esterson, is doing the redesign.</p>
        <p>The renovation, to begin in late 1995, involves remapping to allow for at least 15 more beds, freezer rooms for food and more therapy rooms. Mr. Esterson expects the budget to cover restoring the closed-up archway entrance and maybe even the original cornices.</p>
        <p>"This building has views that you'd pay thousands for on the Upper East Side," Mr. Esterson said. "Now we'll bring the building itself up to speed."</p>
