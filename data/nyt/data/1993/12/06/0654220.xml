        <p>Young &amp; Rubicam New York has reorganized its troubled media department again.</p>
        <p>Robert E. Igiel will leave the Arts and Entertainment cable television network in New York, where he is senior vice president of business development and consumer products, to join Y.&amp; R. New York in the new position of executive vice president and director of broadcast and programming.</p>
        <p>Mr. Igiel, 53, also previously held media department positions at Ayer Inc., BBDO and Y.&amp; R. New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Igiel assumes many of the responsibilities last held by Paul Isacsson, who was an executive vice president and media director, and Gerri Donini, who was executive vice president in charge of national television. They left in September to open IDM International, a New York company specializing in buying commercial time in electronic media.</p>
        <p>As part of a realignment, Mr. Igiel will share the duties of overseeing the media department, which has about 170 employees, with Beth Rockwood, 39, executive vice president of media planning. Ms. Rockwood is being given increased responsibilities for the operations of the department, while continuing to head media planning. Also, both she and Mr. Igiel will become associate directors of the communications services department, reporting to Frank Anfield, the president and chief executive of Y.&amp; R. New York.</p>
        <p>During the last two years, the media department at Y.&amp; R. New York has suffered frequent turnover among top executives and the losses of large accounts. "The industry questions if Y.&amp; R. can ever recover from the media department embarrassments that inept management has wrought," according to the November issue of Jack Myers's Advertising Insights newsletter.</p>
