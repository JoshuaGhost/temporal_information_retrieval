        <p>Cheered by better job prospects and rising incomes, consumers are feeling much more confident about the economy than they have in a long while.</p>
        <p>The Conference Board confidence index jumped to 80.2 this month, from 71.9 in November, the business research organization reported yesterday. That followed a similar report by the University of Michigan, which told its clients privately earlier this month that its measure surged to 88.2 in the first half of December, from 81.2 in November. The Federal Government uses the Michigan figures in its forecasts of economic growth.</p>
        <p>"Confidence is starting to come back," said Mark S. Herrmann, president of Mark Buick in Yonkers. "I'm much more optimistic about the short-term future than I was." Spending Pause Is Possible</p>
        <p>How consumers feel this month is not necessarily a reliable gauge of how much they will spend next month -- witness the spending pause last winter that followed a burst of good feeling.</p>
        <p>But economists say they are encouraged by the fact, evident in both surveys, that consumers are responding as much to a better here and now as to hopes of future improvement. Though this month's overall confidence readings are similar to last December's, consumers are far more upbeat about current conditions than they were back then.</p>
        <p>And while only some forecasters are nudging up their estimates for the first quarter on the basis of the recent consumer readings, the restoration of confidence is at least reinforcing economists' predictions of continued moderate growth in the new year.</p>
        <p>"If we didn't have this much momentum, I'd be more worried about the negative impact of the tax increases next year," Nicholas Perna, chief economist at the Shawmut National Corporation, said. "This momentum will enable us to get 3 percent growth in first half of 1994."</p>
        <p>The outbreak of positive thinking is showing up in many parts of the country, from a small but steady stream of first-time home buyers in Tarrytown, N.Y., to crowded clothing stores in Tulsa, Okla.</p>
        <p>Car sales, retail sales and home sales have all picked up in recent months. And yesterday's weekly Johnson Redbook survey of two dozen national retail chains showed that while sales were down in November from December on a seasonally adjusted basis, they were 10.1 percent higher this Christmas week than a year earlier.</p>
        <p>There is no sign, either, that consumers have slacked off their spending since Dec. 25.</p>
        <p>"The last couple of days have been awesome," said Leo M. Ragoza, general manager of Danbury Fair, the largest shopping complex in New England. "People not only returning, but buying. They are not holding back those dollars. They're spending cash. They're using a lot of plastic."</p>
        <p>Mr. Ragoza says customers are turning more confident, which is less surprising considering that the jobless rate in Connecticut and elsewhere in New England has dropped sharply in the last year.</p>
        <p>Most of the 230 stores in the mall sold more this season than last, Mr. Ragoza said, with some reporting "huge numbers." Another sign of confidence comes from what people are buying a lot of -- big ticket appliances, computers and furniture. 'Traffic Is Strong'</p>
        <p>At Woodland Hills Mall in Tulsa, the general manager, Mark F. Hunter, said that the 150 stores in his mall were reporting double-digit sales gains from a year earlier. And despite an undercurrent of concern among consumers about layoffs at American Airlines and McDonnell Douglas, two mainstays of Oklahoma's economy, Mr. Hunter said, "Traffic is strong now."</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, there is almost no talk of a boom. Indeed, virtually all economists expect the growth of consumer spending -- especially on big-ticket items -- to cool in the first half of 1994 in large part because it has been so torrid lately.</p>
        <p>"Spending on durables has really been ramping up," David Kelly, senior economist at Lehman Brothers Global Economics, said. "It's hard to maintain that pace of growth."</p>
        <p>For one thing, consumers are spending money faster than they are making it and squeezing their saving rate to do so.</p>
        <p>For another, there's President Clinton's tax increase, which caused no pain at all in 1993 -- nobody had to pay the extra tax right away -- but will show up in withholding next month.</p>
        <p>Finally, some of the economy's strength is transient. Although most economists, including those in the Administration, look for the growth rate to reach 4 percent to 5 percent in the quarter that ends a few days from now, that strength includes auto makers' scramble to build up inventories as well as a return to normal activity after the flood in the Midwest.</p>
        <p>Yet the evidence that economists are sifting makes them doubt that any slowdown in the first quarter will be as abrupt or as painful as it was last winter. Lower oil prices should restore most if not all of the purchasing power lost to tax increases. Flush retailers may well fire fewer than the usual million store clerks they have cut in past post-holiday seasons. And income growth, while not quite as fast as that of spending, has not trailed all that badly. Since a year ago, inflation-adjusted income has risen 2.8 percent while spending is up 3.5 percent.</p>

        <p>Business Confidence Up</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, Dec. 28 (AP) -- Business executives' confidence in the economy improved sharply in December to the highest level in eight months, the United States Chamber of Commerce said today. "The economy appears to have shed some of the cautiousness exhibited earlier this year and clearly stepped up a notch," the chamber's chief economist, Martin A. Regalia, said.</p>
        <p>The chamber's business confidence index, reported every other month, was 54.3 in December, up from 46.4 in October,the highest level since April. A reading between 50 and 70 indicates moderate economic growth. In December, 8,594 executives responded to the survey.</p>
        <p>The proportion of respondents expecting the economy to improve over the next six months nearly doubled, to 30.2 percent in December from 16.5 percent in October. Those expecting deterioration fell, to 26.2 percent of those surveyed from 42.2 percent.</p>
