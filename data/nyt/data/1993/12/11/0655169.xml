        <p>Selling Against the Box</p>
        <p>With a short sale against the box, in which the short sale is covered by the purchase of an equivalent number of shares, what is the cost basis in determining profit or loss?</p>
        <p>MARION J. CADLEY, Garden City, L.I.</p>
        <p>In a short sale against the box, shares are sold in the same quantity as shares already owned. This technique is often used to lock in a paper profit and postpone a taxable gain. At some later date, you will close out the short position by buying the equivalent number of shares. Your gain or loss will be measured by the difference between the price of the stock sold short and the cost basis of the stock used to close the short sale.</p>

        <p>Selling Against the Box</p>
        <p>With a short sale against the box, in which the short sale is covered by the purchase of an equivalent number of shares, what is the cost basis in determining profit or loss?</p>
        <p>MARION J. CADLEY, Garden City, L.I.</p>
        <p>In a short sale against the box, shares are sold in the same quantity as shares already owned. This technique is often used to lock in a paper profit and postpone a taxable gain. At some later date, you will close out the short position by buying the equivalent number of shares. Your gain or loss will be measured by the difference between the price of the stock sold short and the cost basis of the stock used to close the short sale.</p>
        <p>"Long-term or short-term capital gain taxation is determined based on the holding period of the original stock owned at the time of the short sale," said Peter A. Weitsen, a partner in Mendlowitz Weitsen, an accounting firm in East Brunswick, N.J. "If the original stock was held for more than one year at the time of the short against the box and new shares are acquired to cover the sale, any losses will be taxed as long-term regardless of the time period between the short sale and the date the new shares are acquired."</p>
        <p>The exception? Losses on the transaction are disallowed if the short is covered within 30 days of the sale or if the original shares are acquired within 30 days of the short. Redeeming Matured Bonds</p>
        <p>Are corporations or their paying agents under any obligation to notify bondholders of the procedure to be followed for redeeming registered bonds that have matured?</p>
        <p>SAMUEL G. JARKESY, Wayne, N.J.</p>
        <p>When a bond is held to maturity, the issuing corporation, municipality or paying agent is not required to notify all bondholders. These bondholders have the obligation to present the security for collection.</p>
        <p>"If an issue is being redeemed prior to the original maturity date, commonly known as a call," the issuer must notify the holders, said Michael S. Appelbaum, first vice president of Merrill Lynch &amp; Company. And if the bonds are held in an account at a brokerage firm, "the firm has the responsibility to collect all principal and interest payment for the client, whether at maturity or in the event of a call." Social Security</p>
        <p>Can someone who is 62 or older collect Social Security benefits without retiring?</p>
        <p>MICHAEL COMINOTTO, Manhattan</p>
        <p>If you are 62 or older and still working, you may be able to collect Social Security Benefits.</p>
        <p>A person between 62 and 65 can earn up to $8,040 in 1994 and collect all benefits.</p>
        <p>A person 65 or older can earn up to $11,160 and collect full benefits.</p>
        <p>For people with more compensation, there is a deduction from benefits based on earnings.</p>
        <p>Sawl Woolfson, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, provided the following examples: A 62-year-old entitled to a monthly benefit of $600 who earned $20,000 would collect just $1,220 in benefits in 1994; a 65-year-old entitled to a monthly benefit of $1,000 who earned $40,000 during the year would collect $2,987 in benefits.</p>
