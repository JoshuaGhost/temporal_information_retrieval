        <p>New York City's Mayor-elect, Rudolph Giuliani, started work on two essential bridges this week -- to Washington and Albany. Those two capitals supply one-third of the city's revenue as well as reams of legislation that regulates the city's welfare. Good relations make good sense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's meeting with President Clinton in the Oval Office was a smart move for both. New York's Mayor and America's President need each other, as do the city and the nation.</p>

        <p>New York City's Mayor-elect, Rudolph Giuliani, started work on two essential bridges this week -- to Washington and Albany. Those two capitals supply one-third of the city's revenue as well as reams of legislation that regulates the city's welfare. Good relations make good sense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's meeting with President Clinton in the Oval Office was a smart move for both. New York's Mayor and America's President need each other, as do the city and the nation.</p>
        <p>And the choice of Abraham Lackman, a key staff member from the Republican State Senate, as city budget director offers the new administration an extra link to that difficult half of the Legislature. Controlled by upstate and Long Island Republicans, the Senate is often unfriendly to the city's concerns and deaf to pleas by its Democratic mayors.</p>
        <p>The election of a Republican Mayor raises hope that the Senate will now be more accommodating. And the Mayor must lead the lobbying. But Mr. Lackman, a senior fiscal adviser to the Senate for the past decade, has an Albany background and contacts that can help.</p>
        <p>As a behind-the-scenes legislative aide, Mr. Lackman knows budgets and deal-making -- with a sideline in thwarting New York mayors. Now about to become the Mayor's man on a more conspicuous stage, he says he will do whatever Mr. Giuliani wants. That means, above all, somehow balancing the city's budget without new taxes.</p>
        <p>There will be unfamiliar challenges. There are dozens of city agencies Mr. Lackman doesn't know; Wall Street's and Albany's watchdogs will be eyeing his every step. It is a difficult job. Its problems are rooted in the city itself -- overwhelming social needs, an inadequate tax base and expensive labor contracts. Albany and Washington can help, but City Hall must do the heavy lifting.</p>
