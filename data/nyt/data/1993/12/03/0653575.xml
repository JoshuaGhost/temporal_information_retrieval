        <p>The Secretary of Energy said today that her department had a "moral obligation" to help electric utilities store spent fuel from nuclear reactors, even though the department could not keep its promise to take the fuel off their hands beginning in 1998.</p>
        <p>In a sharp turnaround from the Bush Administration, which denied it had any responsibility for the waste, she said her department might cover the utilities' cost for storage.</p>
        <p>Under contracts signed in the 1980's, the Energy Department has been collecting a waste disposal fee from utility companies amounting to a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour generated in reactors. It has used about $3 billion in the search for a permanent waste repository but still has more than $4 billion on hand, and it is still collecting $600 million a month.</p>
        <p>But no permanent repository will be ready until 2013 at the earliest, said the Energy Secretary, Hazel R. O'Leary, in an interview today. A temporary repository is possible, she said, but "we're not going to make it by 1998." The contracts call for the Government to begin pick-ups of the waste then. Mostly Under Water Now</p>
        <p>During the Bush Administration, the Energy Department argued that the contracts did not require it to accept the wastes if it had no place to put them.</p>
        <p>Most of the spent fuel is now stored in pools of water next to the reactor buildings, but at many plants these will be full by 1998. Water shields radiation and keeps the waste cool.</p>
        <p>Some utilities have built "dry cask storage," concrete and steel casks sitting behind barbed wire near the reactors, and other companies have asked permission to build such casks.</p>
        <p>But in several states, most notably Florida, Michigan and Minnesota, state public service commissions have complained that raising electric rates to cover the expense of building such structures amounts to a double charge to consumers for storage, since the companies have already paid the Energy Department.</p>
        <p>"I don't think anybody is really pleased by that prospect," said Janice E. Owens of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, a Washington association of state officials that has been pressing the issue.  Paying Costs of Casks</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Leary said she had directed her staff to find a mechanism by which the department could pay the cost of casks at reactor sites, beginning at the dates that the fuel would have been picked up. This might take the form of a credit against future waste fund payments, an aide said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Owens said another mechanism might be for the Energy Department to develop, manufacture and deliver to each reactor a container that would be used for storage for an interim period. The container would then be used for shipping the material to a permanent repository, she said, and would be the final package for the wastes.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department is studying whether Yucca Mountain, in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nev., would be suitable as a permanent repository, but the study has been plagued with technical problems and political disputes.</p>
        <p>Mrs. O'Leary said she was convinced that for reasons of security, safety and economy, a centralized storage site for the casks was preferable to cask storage at many different reactor sites.</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 11, 1993, Saturday</p>
        <p>An article on Dec. 3 about disposal of spent fuel from civilian nuclear reactors misstated the amount paid by the utilities to the Federal Government for that purpose. It is about $600 million a year.</p>
