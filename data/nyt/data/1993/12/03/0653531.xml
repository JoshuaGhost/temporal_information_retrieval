        <p>Snow and sorrow and twisted steel today covered the man-made hill near here where a commuter plane crashed Wednesday night, killing all 18 people on board.</p>
        <p>The plane went down less than two miles from this city in northern Minnesota, about 60 miles northwest of Duluth. But the crash site was so isolated and the night so dark and thick with fog and freezing drizzle that no one saw the plane hit the side of the hill, an old mine dump.</p>
        <p>This type of plane, a twin-engine Jetstream 3100 turboprop made by British Aerospace, has been involved in at least two other crashes in icy weather conditions. The National Transportation Safety Board, citing icing as a factor in those crashes, has pushed for devices that would improve the ability of the planes to fly through icy conditions. The Federal Aviation Administration has said generally that current rules are adequate. Voice Recorder Is Found</p>
        <p>At a crowded news conference tonight, John Hammerschmidt, a member of the safety board, said investigators had recovered the plane's cockpit-voice recorder, a potentially crucial piece of evidence.</p>
        <p>The device records the conversations between a flight crew and the control tower. But it also records engine noises and other sounds that could help in the investigation. The recorder has been sent to Washington, where the safety board has its headquarters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hammerschmidt said investigators had not yet been able to get into the cockpit because it was "pancaked on top of itself" and that it was too early to tell if the plane was properly de-iced.</p>
        <p>He said that other pilots had reported icing in the area and that the control tower in Duluth had passed the information to the crew of the Jetstream. Northwest Commuter Service</p>
        <p>Like the planes in the previous crashes, the one that crashed here on Wednesday was coming in for a landing. It lay smashed and scattered in three pieces for more than an hour before it was found after disappearing from radar screens at the Chisholm-Hibbing Airport at 7:58 P.M., central standard time. Rescuers had to use snowmobiles to reach the wreckage and the dead.</p>
        <p>The flight, 5719, was traveling from Minneapolis to Hibbing, and was operated for Northwest Airlink, a Northwest Airlines commuter service, by Express Airlines II.</p>
        <p>Eleven of the 16 passengers were scheduled to get off in Hibbing, a city of 18,000 people in the heart of the Mesabi Range, which contains vast deposits of iron ore. The remaining passengers were scheduled to continue on to International Falls, Minn.</p>
        <p>The dead were the first passenger fatalities in an accident involving a major airline in the United States since March 22, 1992, when a USAir Fokker F-28 crashed while taking off from La Guardia Airport in New York, killing 27 people. Wednesday's crash was the worst in Minnesota since 1950, when 15 people were killed.</p>
        <p>Earlier today, Federal investigators from the safety board trudged up and down the hill, looking for clues. Other workers carried away the bodies.</p>
        <p>"We haven't ruled anything out," a spokesman for the safety board, Alan Pollock, said today. "Right now we are looking at a jigsaw puzzle, trying to piece together the facts." Hill Made of Waste Ore</p>
        <p>That will not be easy. The terrain is so steep that the wreckage was in danger of sliding down the hill with the bodies still inside, and had to be secured with ropes. The hill, made up of waste ore, was 100 to 150 feet high.</p>
        <p>The weather today was gray and cold. But when the plane crashed and skipped across the hill before flipping upside down and breaking up, the weather was even worse. A woman who lives near the crash site said the fog was so heavy that she could not make out the street light in front of her house.</p>
        <p>When the plane went down, Chief Doug Moberg of the Hibbing Fire Department enlisted six members of the Trailblazers Snowmobile Club to help with the search.</p>
        <p>Denny Rice, the club's emergency coordinator, said the club members arrived at the crash site about 9:30 P.M. and spent the rest of the night and early morning transporting other rescue workers, police officers and the medical examiner up the hill.</p>
        <p>Rescue workers eventually brought in heavy plows to create an access road. A generator was later brought in and lights were set up, casting the hilltop in a false dawn. No Smoke or Fire</p>
        <p>Mr. Rice said when he first arrived on the scene one or two bodies were lying outside the wreckage. The rest were still inside the crumbled plane.</p>
        <p>He said that there was no smoke or fire but that the smell of fuel hung heavy in the air for hours and much of the debris was buried in snow.</p>
        <p>Officials said the Northwest Airlink turboprop did not make a distress call. Other planes had landed at the Hibbing-Chisholm Airport earlier Wednesday with no problems. Pilot and Co-Pilot Identified</p>
        <p>Airline officials identified the pilot as Capt. Marvin S. Falitz, 42, of Burnsville, Minn., and said he had 6,5000 hours of flight experience. The plane's first officer, Chad A. Erickson, 25, of Dassel, Minn., had more than 2,000 hours of flying experience.</p>
        <p>While emphasizing that there were many possible explanations for Wednesday's crash, Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the safety board, cited the accumulation of ice disrupting the flow of air over the wings as a factor in the two previous crashes of Jetstream 3100's. On Dec. 26, 1989, a United Express 3100 crashed on approach to Pasco, Wash., killing all six people aboard. On Jan. 30, 1991, a 3100 operated by USAir Express crashed while trying to land in Beckley, W.Va. No one was killed, but 16 of the 19 people on board were injured.</p>
