        <p>Kennedy Book Update</p>
        <p>Now that the 30th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination has come and gone, and with it the endless retrospectives, magazine and newspaper articles and television specials, it's worth asking: how did the several dozen J. F. K. books published to coincide with the occasion fare in the country's bookstores?</p>
        <p>The answer is that some did better than others and many seemed to cancel each other out, as is often the case when so many similar books emerge at once. It will take months before final figures are in, of course. But so far, in a field that runs the gamut from coffee-table picture books to meticulously researched biographies to outre accounts of new conspiracy theories, the most successful has been Gerald Posner's "Case Closed" (Random House), which takes the radically unradical view that there was no conspiracy surrounding Kennedy's assassination.</p>

        <p>Kennedy Book Update</p>
        <p>Now that the 30th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination has come and gone, and with it the endless retrospectives, magazine and newspaper articles and television specials, it's worth asking: how did the several dozen J. F. K. books published to coincide with the occasion fare in the country's bookstores?</p>
        <p>The answer is that some did better than others and many seemed to cancel each other out, as is often the case when so many similar books emerge at once. It will take months before final figures are in, of course. But so far, in a field that runs the gamut from coffee-table picture books to meticulously researched biographies to outre accounts of new conspiracy theories, the most successful has been Gerald Posner's "Case Closed" (Random House), which takes the radically unradical view that there was no conspiracy surrounding Kennedy's assassination.</p>
        <p>The book, which came out several months earlier than the rest and was boosted by a steady stream of publicity orchestrated by the indefatigable Harold M. Evans, the publisher of the Random House adult trade group, has now gone through five printings, with a total of 135,000 copies in print. It spent five weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, reaching No. 8 before falling off.</p>
        <p>Richard Reeves's "President Kennedy: Profile of Power" (Simon &amp; Schuster), a comprehensive study of the Kennedy Presidency, which was helped by good reviews and the almost universal impression that it was a serious book in a pack of lighter ones, is also selling well, with 85,000 copies in print. At Ingram, one of the country's largest independent book distributors, Susie Russenberger, the director of trade books, said that about 6,000 copies of the Reeves book had been sold, many of them in the last few weeks.</p>
        <p>Some stores and some chains took the opportunity to devote special sections to the Kennedy crop, displaying them all at once. Among myriad others are Robert J. Groden's "Killing of a President" (Viking), a $30 coffee-table book; Bill Sloan and Jean Hill's "J. F. K.: The Last Dissenting Witness" (Pelican Publishing); Gaeton Fonzi's "Last Investigation" (Thunder's Mouth); Harrison Edward Livingstone's "Killing the Truth" (Carroll &amp; Graf); Oleg M. Nechiporenko's "Passport to Assassination (Birch Lane/Carol Publishing); a compilation of letters to "Dear Abby" called "The Day J. F. K Died" (Andrews &amp; McMeel) and the Kennedy-satellite books, like Wendy Leigh's "Prince Charming" (Dutton), a book about John Kennedy Jr. Consumers can be forgiven for feeling awash in an overwhelming sea of books, particularly when so many old Kennedy books are still around.</p>
        <p>"No, we haven't seen an upsurge in sales of these books at all," said Adam Brent, the manager of Stuart Brent books in Chicago, which has been carrying a handful of the new batch. "My feeling is that it was already covered with the Oliver Stone movie and so I think the enthusiasm for finding out as much as possible probably took place then. At some point, people just get saturated with this."  On the Way to Court</p>
        <p>The legal fight between David Leavitt and the British poet Stephen Spender continues in Britain with Mr. Leavitt's latest novel, "While England Sleeps," still barred from British bookstores as the two parties prepare to go to trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spender sued in October. He contends that Mr. Leavitt unfairly appropriated much of "While England Sleeps," an account of a love affair between two men during the Spanish Civil War, from Mr. Spender's 1948 memoir, "World Within World," and made it objectionably pornographic as well. A judge in the case issued a temporary order barring Viking, Mr. Leavitt's publisher, from distributing the book in Britain. Last week, the injunction was upheld at a hearing in which the judge also granted Mr. Spender's request for a speedy trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spender is suing to stop distribution of the book on two grounds: that Mr. Leavitt's novel breaches the copyright of "World Within World," and that it violates a British law that protects artists and authors from having their work altered. Mr. Spender said in a recent interview that he had made an effort to settle the case earlier this fall, asking that the book include a discussion of Mr. Leavitt's sources, but that Viking had refused.</p>
        <p>Sam Sylvester, Mr. Spender's lawyer in London, said Mr. Leavitt had been ordered to turn over all his book-related notes, as well as his correspondence with Viking. People familiar with the case said both sides were discussing the possibility of a settlement to avoid a trial.</p>
        <p>In England, the book had already been printed and was ready to be shipped when the suit was filed. Some copies of "While England Sleeps" even found their way to bookstores before the original injunction, but Viking asked that they be removed and returned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leavitt, who divides his time between the United States and Italy, said through a spokesman that he did not want to comment until the legal issues had been resolved. The matter seems to have had little effect on the sales of "While England Sleeps" here. The book has reached the best-seller list at The San Francisco Chronicle, in a city where Mr. Leavitt traditionally does well, and is now in its fourth printing, with just under 30,000 copies in print, said Paul Slovak, a spokesman for Viking.  Pirates on Literary Seas</p>
        <p>Saying it wants to increase its efforts to eradicate the trade in pirated and illegally copied books around the world, the Association of American Publishers has been focusing its attention on Southeast Asia, where it says the problem is particularly acute. Two weeks ago, partly because of complaints lodged by the publishers and other groups, Indonesian authorities raided three printers and two publishers in Jakarta, charging them with producing hundreds of thousands of illegal books and software manuals a year.</p>
        <p>And yesterday, Malaysian officials raided three photocopy shops in Kuala Lumpur, seizing both the photocopying machines and a large number of illegally copied textbooks, said Carol A. Risher, the vice president for copyright for the publishers' group. Ms. Risher said that pirated books cost American publishers $40 million a year in Indonesia alone.</p>
