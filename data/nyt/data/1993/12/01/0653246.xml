        <p>Marvin H. Bernstein, a businessman and philanthropist in New York for many years, died on Sunday at the Miami Heart Institute. He was 66 and lived in Miami.</p>

        <p>Correction:  December 2, 1993, Thursday</p>
        <p>An obituary yesterday about Marvin H. Bernstein, a businesman and philanthropist in New York, misspelled the name of the center for Holocaust studies based in Los Angeles for which he was a fund-raiser and contributor. It is the Simon Wiesenthal Center.</p>
