        <p>KEVIN DUCKWORTH, who went from All-Star center to disgruntled reserve in Portland, was traded by the Trail Blazers to the Washington Bullets for forward HARVEY GRANT. The Bullets also acquired "other considerations" neither club would identify.</p>
        <p>The 27-year-old Grant, who has averaged more than 18 points each of the last three seasons and led the Bullets in scoring last year at 18.6 a game, said he was elated and had asked to be traded to a contender. Duckworth, 29, a 7-footer whose weight often exceeded 280 pounds, averaged 18.1 points a game in 1988-89, but his average steadily dropped, falling to 9.9 this past season.
