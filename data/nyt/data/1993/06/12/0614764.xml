        <p>The authorities said the high court in Abuja, the capital, had no right to preside over the conduct of the elections. The vote will be held as scheduled, they said, despite allegations that the election may have already been marred by fraud and vote-buying.</p>

        <p>Nigeria's military authorities announced today that the first presidential elections in nearly a decade would go ahead as planned on Saturday, despite a ruling from the nation's highest court that the voting be postponed.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the high court in Abuja, the capital, had no right to preside over the conduct of the elections. The vote will be held as scheduled, they said, despite allegations that the election may have already been marred by fraud and vote-buying.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the decision late Thursday night by Justice Bassey Ikpeme has suddenly altered the political landscape. Uncertainty reigned today as the excitement that normally precedes elections appeared to evaporate. American Official Expelled</p>
        <p>Nigeria's state radio also announced tonight that the Government was expelling Michael O'Brien, the director of the United States Information Agency here, for what it called his "blatant interference" in Nigeria's internal affairs. According to the Government, Mr. O'Brien issued a statement early today saying that the postponement of the elections Saturday "was unacceptable to the United States Government."</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Brien was given 72 hours to leave the country.</p>
        <p>The Government also announced that it was withdrawing the accreditation for eight Americans who are here as election observers.</p>
        <p>The two-party presidential poll is being contested by Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party and Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. Both are widely regarded as close friends and allies of Nigeria's military leader, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, and the victor is not expected to stray far from the political and economic course chartered by the current administration.</p>
        <p>An opinion poll of about 2,500 likely voters published today in The Nigerian Tribune, an independent newspaper, put Mr. Abiola ahead, with 47.3 percent of the vote, as opposed to 28.3 percent for Mr. Tofa. However, 24.4 percent of those polled did not indicate how they would vote.</p>
        <p>In granting a temporary injunction halting the elections, Justice Ikpeme said the National Electoral Commission should not proceed until it heard allegations brought by the Association for a Better Nigeria, a group that supports an extension of military rule.</p>
        <p>The association has led a highly visible campaign to keep General Babangida in power for at least four more years, or until -- in their words -- civilian politicians show themselves capable of establishing democracy.</p>
        <p>General Babangida has said repeatedly that, come what may, the military will return to its barracks on Aug. 27 and leave the governing to elected civilians. But critics note that he has done nothing to discourage those who have called for him to remain in office.</p>
