        <p>Gov. Jim Florio's ban on blind trusts for New Jersey's public-office holders is undeniably political. It is nonetheless a useful acknowledgment that some blind trusts are not really blind. But the Governor went too far in throwing out all such trusts. Properly used, they can be valuable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio's executive order followed the embarrassing disclosure that his chief of staff, Joseph Salema, owned 50 percent of a small securities firm that has built up a disproportionate share of New Jersey bond business. Federal investigators have yet to charge anyone with wrongdoing. But the governor is up for re-election, and hardly needs a scandal in his outer office. So his chief aide is gone, and Mr. Florio is hastily tightening ship.</p>
        <p>First he decreed that underwriters for state bonds must be selected by competitive bidding, rather than direct negotiation. He had proposed this before, but did nothing until he was hit with the Salema problem. He has also endorsed a Republican proposal to curb underwriters' political contributions, though he accepts them himself.</p>
        <p>The move against blind trusts recognizes that putting Mr. Salema's securities firm in a trustee's hands was no shield against anything. The existence of a blind trust implies that the owner-investor turns everything over to a trustee, and has no idea what the trustee does with it. But if the entrusted interest is ownership of a business, or of a big piece of one, there is nothing the trustee can do with it.</p>
        <p>In such cases the blind trust is only a fig leaf, and Mr. Florio has properly put an end to the practice. If some qualified people now won't accept appointment to high office, so be it.</p>
        <p>The purpose of a blind trust is to allow talented people to serve government without disrupting their financial lives by forcing them to sell off their holdings. If those holdings are a diversified portfolio, surely a trustee could administer them in a way that is truly blind from the officeholder. The Federal Government has thoughtful rules for blind trusts, governing the nature of the assets and the independence of the trustee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio is right to challenge misuse of such trusts, and to bear down on conflicts of interest. The real point of the Governor's order is that people in a position to make decisions -- some 2,000 officials in New Jersey's case -- should not have significant interest in any enterprise doing business with the state. But he still needs to draw finer distinctions based on principles of good government and not just his political fortunes.</p>
