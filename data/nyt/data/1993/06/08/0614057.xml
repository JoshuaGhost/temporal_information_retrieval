        <p>Snubbing the Couture</p>
        <p>The tease of the season has been that John Galliano was planning to show during Paris's haute couture collections in July. In fact, that was the understanding at Untitled, his primary Manhattan boutique. The theory was that the four-figure price tags on Mr. Galliano's finely worked pieces seemed most compatible with the extravagance of the couture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galliano himself hinted as much when he sat out the last round of ready-to-wear collections. Seated instead in the audience at the Chanel show last March, he said the date of his next show would be "a surprise."</p>

        <p>Snubbing the Couture</p>
        <p>The tease of the season has been that John Galliano was planning to show during Paris's haute couture collections in July. In fact, that was the understanding at Untitled, his primary Manhattan boutique. The theory was that the four-figure price tags on Mr. Galliano's finely worked pieces seemed most compatible with the extravagance of the couture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galliano himself hinted as much when he sat out the last round of ready-to-wear collections. Seated instead in the audience at the Chanel show last March, he said the date of his next show would be "a surprise."</p>
        <p>Well, surprise. His office in Paris said he would show during ready-to-wear season, in October, as he did a year ago. It is, after all, when most of the fashion press and buyers make the Paris pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>The career of Mr. Galliano, a British designer, is more like the motorcycles of his homeland than its cuisine: temperamental and a bit unreliable, all fits and starts (just like the Triumph). But when it's running well, it's like art on wheels.</p>
        <p>His latest backer is Facal Amor, the Moroccan-born owner of Amor, which produces the trendy, tarty Plein Sud line, traditionally shown to the French long after the foreign fashion pack have gone home. Obsessed for Obsession</p>
        <p>Waif watchers who protested Kate Moss's realistic British Vogue shots better brace themselves for a new installment of cinema verite. The young model just returned from a week on a near-deserted Caribbean island with her boyfriend, the photographer Mario Sorrenti, where he filmed footage of her for a new Calvin Klein Obsession television and print campaign to bow in September.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorrenti, 21, carries a personal book of writings and pictures of Ms. Moss, 19, which he showed Mr. Klein.</p>
        <p>"It was perfect for Obsession -- his real obsession with her," Mr. Klein said during a benefit at his East Hampton, L.I., house for the Campaign for Military Service. "You can see the love he has for this girl. I said let's give him a camera and let him shoot his feelings for her."</p>
        <p>The senior vice president of advertising, Neil Kraft, joined the couple on Jost Van Dyke, a small island off St. Thomas, V.I., after they'd shot for six days all alone a la "Blue Lagoon." Ms. Moss went from the shoot to the middle of the 300-model Los Angeles Calvin extravaganza. "I insisted for the last two days that we have hair and makeup people and a major director," Mr. Kraft said. "But we didn't need any of it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein said: "It's believable. It was the same thing with Marky Mark. I got him because he had a thing for my underwear. It's incredible how Marky associates certain dates and what's sexy with his underwear. It's just like Mario feels about Kate. People want that reality."  Macy's New Voice</p>
        <p>While uptown stores have been squaring off preparing for the retail rumble when Barneys New York opens on Madison Avenue in September, Macy's has been quietly trying to regain ground it may have lost as a result of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. And the first step in firming up a fashion viewpoint was giving Benny Lin the title of fashion director at the beginning of April.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lin's responsiblities have grown along with Macy's renewed confidence; he will be involved in the fashion segments of Macy's 24-hour shopping channel when it begins in the fall of 1994. Mr. Lin, 30, oversees buying at 58 East Coast stores and the recent resolutely hip advertising and window displays.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lin, who was born in Hong Kong, began his career at Macy's as an executive trainee 10 years ago. He helped reformulate Macy's approach to designer fashion with a department called New Signatures, a mix of 25 young designers' collections put together on the third floor of the Herald Square store in spare assortments, like pieces from a dream closet. He said he was the first to carry Cynthia Rowley sportswear and the designs of Gemma Kahng, Todd Oldham and Byron Lars. He also established the first Anna Sui in-store boutique.</p>
        <p>"Basically, we do not try to be any of the uptown stores," he said. "We aim specifically for downtown clientele. We're fashion-forward, very editorial-driven, extremely trend conscious."</p>
        <p>If that doesn't exactly sound like the Macy's you remember, it does sound like something people have been missing: a store with a confident fashion voice.</p>
