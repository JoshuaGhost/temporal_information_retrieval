        <p>When the 435 delegates to the American Medical Association's governing congress arrive here Sunday for their annual summer meeting, the first speaker on the agenda will be Hillary Rodham Clinton. The doctors will be listening closely for hints on who among them -- if anyone -- the Clinton Administration has been heeding as it develops its proposal for overhauling the nation's health-care system.</p>
        <p>Until recently, there would not have been any question. The medical association was the undisputed, all-powerful voice of medicine in Washington, and no major overhaul had much chance of succeeding without its cooperation.</p>
        <p>These days, though, the association is battling to make itself heard over some 80 medical specialty groups, many of whose views on health reform differ substantially from those of the A.M.A.</p>
        <p>And splits within the doctors' ranks are part of a larger trend that has undermined the association's stature in Washington. Insurers, hospitals, medical-equipment makers, pharmaceutical companies and support professions are all much more powerful players than before. 'Other Centers of Power'</p>
        <p>"As medicine became the nation's biggest business, other centers of power arose," said Dr. Quentin Young, a prominent Chicago internist.</p>
        <p>In the early days of the health debate, the medical association and the other trade groups all found themselves shunted to the sidelines as secret groups appointed by the Clinton Administration weighed possible overhauls. Eventually the cold shoulder was supplanted by a polite ear, allowing Dr. James S. Todd, the association's top executive, and other representatives to have frequent meetings with top Government policy makers.</p>
        <p>Dr. Todd says he is convinced that those meetings have resulted in modifications of the Administration's thinking. But, he adds, "We won't know the results until we see the proposal."</p>
        <p>The medical association has about 290,000 members -- roughly 41 percent of the nation's doctors. While the number is higher than ever, the percentage is well down from the 70 percent level the organization enjoyed before dues were increased sharply in the 1970's and the specialty groups began expanding rapidly.</p>
        <p>The organization still commands both public and professional respect for its anti-smoking and other public health campaigns, and its many scientific publications. And its political action committee, by far the richest of any in the health field, remains the profession's preferred vehicle for trying to catch Washington's attention with dollars. In the last two years, the committee has donated more than $2.9 million, most of it to Congressional candidates -- more than any other lobbying group except the National Association of Realtors. 'Need More Input'</p>
        <p>But the membership includes many doctors, especially women, members of minorities and students, or residents, who feel that their views and needs are given too little weight because aging white males dominate its governing boards and activities.</p>
        <p>"A lot of the individuals at the top need more input from those of us who are going to practice for the next 30 years," said Dr. Jorge Menendez, a young plastic surgeon from Stamford, Conn., who attended a medical association meeting in Washington in March.</p>
        <p>Most of the major specialty groups send representatives to the association's House of Delegates, a medical version of Congress that meets twice a year to set policies for the group. Citing the representatives' participation, the association asserts it speaks to and for 90 percent of the medical profession.</p>
        <p>That may be true on issues like the group's campaigns against smoking or reducing malpractice suits. But it is hardly the case in the current debate on revamping the health-care system.</p>
        <p>Some specialty groups like the 80,000-member American College of Physicians and the 72,000-member American Academy of Family Physicians have split with the medical association by endorsing a national cap on health spending. Several smaller groups, like the 6,000-member Physicians for a National Health Program, go further, arguing for a Government-managed system like Canada's. A.M.A. Proposals Criticized</p>
        <p>The schisms were most vivid last year when the medical association's revamping proposals were publicly derided by Dr. John Ball, executive vice president of the College of Physicians, for lacking any "realistic or effective cost-containment measures." The public hatchets were buried after a January meeting between the two groups.</p>
        <p>But Congressional staff members say many medical groups are complaining privately that the association's views are getting too much attention. And most specialty groups have little confidence that the association can be relied on to protect all of their interests.</p>
        <p>The increased visibility of other medical groups and of trade groups that laid out varying overhaul ideas has helped Dr. Todd and a new generation of A.M.A. leaders that came to power in the late 1980's push the association's old guard toward compromises and advocacy of national changes that would have been unthinkable a short time ago.</p>
        <p>Dr. Todd, a 62 year-old Cape Cod native who practiced surgery in New York City and New Jersey for more than 20 years before joining the association's staff in 1985, took over as executive vice president in 1990. That same year, the association shocked the Bush Administration by calling for major overhauls, including requirements that employers provide minimum health insurance for all workers and that the Government finance insurance for everyone else.</p>
        <p>"The White House called us on the carpet," said Dr. Todd, recalling with relish the publicity that ensued. "I asked what they wanted us to do and Dick Darman just said, 'Cool it!' " Dr. Todd added, referring to Richard G. Darman, President Bush's budget chief.</p>
        <p>The association did not back away, but many other groups, including a number of medical specialty societies, were already advocating far bigger changes. The association has responded with a flexibility that has impressed many former critics.</p>
        <p>"The Government may have arrived a little after Hippocrates, but they've decided they have to negotiate with us and that we shouldn't be treated with disdain," said Representative Pete Stark, the California Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.</p>
        <p>In an effort to broaden the appeal of its proposals, the association has gradually softened its opposition to broad spending limits, provided doctors can participate in setting them. And association leaders have suggested they might back voluntary price controls to help keep costs down as changes are being phased in, if the package includes reduced exposure to malpractice suits, streamlined insurance systems and less Government regulation.</p>
        <p>"Our proposals and the College of Physicians are now pretty similar when you take into account all the fine print," said Dr. Todd, who constantly preaches the virtues of coalition-building over confrontation. "The Clinton Administration has definitely been encouraging everyone to come to them separately to divide and conquer us."</p>
        <p>Leaders of rival medical groups and Washington insiders agree that the association's influence could grow when it comes time to cut deals over legislative and regulatory language. No other group is in a better position to find and expand points of consensus.</p>
        <p>"We deal with the A.M.A. only," said Michael Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents 1,400 for-profit hospitals and is one of several hospital trade groups active in the debate on health reform. "We're not going to run around dealing with all the splinter groups of doctors."</p>
        <p>The association encourages such attitudes by supporting 17 Washington lobbyists, a presence that dwarfs other medical groups. And the group has the wealth -- a $200 million total annual budget, most spent on educational activities, and $100 million in reserves -- and experience mobilizing doctors to shape public and Congressional opinion.</p>
        <p>"My colleagues listen to folks from home and that's the A.M.A.'s strength," said Representative Stark. The Biggest Challenge?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the A.M.A.'s biggest challenge will be to combat the general assumption that it is more interested in its members' welfare than the public's.  The group's own surveys show that the average doctor's earnings jumped from $48,000 in 1973 to more than $170,000 in 1991, about 15 percent more than general inflation.</p>
        <p>But the figures mask wide disparities. Dr. Todd said that many doctors have lost ground during that period. Surveys also show an overwhelming majority of doctors saying that increased regulation has made medicine far less satisfying over the years.</p>
        <p>As the debate unfolds, the group continues to flesh out its position with new reports. The upcoming congress, for example, will review the organization's latest plan for what should be included in a basic health-insurance package for all Americans. But Dr. Todd is already trying to prepare his members for a sobering outcome.</p>
        <p>"I don't think the A.M.A.'s influence is waning but the problems are so much greater that no one is getting everything they want," he said.</p>
