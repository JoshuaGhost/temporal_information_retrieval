        <p>PERHAPS no building embodies the myths of the American West better than the Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone National Park, where the mere act of entering the lobby -- an enchanted treehouse come to life -- provides the same sense of awe as the wilderness itself.</p>
        <p>For devotees of rustic architecture, the hotel, designed in 1903 by the architect Robert C.

        <p>PERHAPS no building embodies the myths of the American West better than the Old Faithful Inn in Yellowstone National Park, where the mere act of entering the lobby -- an enchanted treehouse come to life -- provides the same sense of awe as the wilderness itself.</p>
        <p>For devotees of rustic architecture, the hotel, designed in 1903 by the architect Robert C. Reamer and built within oooooh-ing distance of Old Faithful, defines Yellowstone as a place as surely as the geysers and mountains that inspired it. Its atrium lobby, one of the most dramatic and dotty log interiors ever created, is surely the only one in which the bellmen sleep in a belfry called "Bat's Alley" and guests can sip from a drinking fountain embedded in a boulder or gaze at an shiplike indoor crow's nest seven stories up.</p>
        <p>The inn influenced generations of rustic national park architecture and withstood the 1988 forest fire that came within 1,000 feet of engulfing it. Replacing the hotel would be difficult, if not impossible, for it is Abe Lincoln's cabin, an Adirondack great camp and Mad King Ludwig's castle rolled into one.</p>
        <p>If you are the sort of traveler who can love a clanking radiator -- as long as it's cast-iron Victorian -- the quirks of one of the most heavily frequented national park hotels will not bother you. But, like a slightly loony relative, beloved landmarks can be unpredictable. For every delicious creak of the wooden planks in the lobby, or the funny wobbling twig banisters, there are less lovable details, like the see-through coffee, the "four-minute egg" that takes 18 minutes and the waitress who proudly announces that today's special vegetarian lasagna is Stouffer's.</p>
        <p>Character involves trade-offs. Character the hotel has in spades. It begins at the parking lot, where bison roam amid the fumes of the tour buses that descend on cue several minutes before Old Faithful's blast-off. It continues at the nearby Hamilton Store, where the rustic style reaches its peak on a knotty porch where the words Knotty Porch are spelled out in twigs. The store has an old-fashioned soda fountain, where lemonade refills are free, and souvenirs that will leave even the most rabid kitsch-lover speechless. (My favorites were the "genuine handcrafted" Indian squaw figurines made of volcanic ash from Mount St. Helens.)</p>
        <p>Like Grand Central Terminal on a weekday, the inn's lobby -- anchored by a stone chimney composed of 500 tons of lava rock -- is a crossroads where disparate worlds collide. It is the place where Liverpudlian and Korean tourists meet flannel-shirted backpackers with topographical maps in their jeans pockets just returned from a week in the back country. (Campers can take a shower for $2.50 before heading to the Bear Pit for an Old Faithful ale.)</p>
        <p>Looming seven stories high, the lobby consists of tier upon tier of balconies stacked to the rafters, leading to a crow's nest that once housed a string quartet (non-acrophobic musicians, presumably). The space is an attic of dreams, punctuated by crisscrossed logs resembling tepee poles and dormer windows that cast diamond-shaped shadows on the walls. Unlike many historic hotels in and around the national parks, this one hasn't been Holiday Inned to death (if you can overlook the Remington reproductions on wood pedestals in the lobby that say Available in Gift Shop, that is). The hotel retains an air of mystery. One of the beauties of staying here, as opposed to just visiting, is that at the end of the day you can put on your slippers, pull up a Mission rocking chair and listen to a fellow guest from Belgium sing "O Sole Mio" from the balcony. The place seems to inspire people to perform.</p>
        <p>Robert Reamer, the architect, was 29 years old when the Yellowstone Park Association hired him to design a lodge for the Old Faithful area in the northwest corner of Wyoming. The siting of the hotel was ingenious, as the architectural historian Harvey Kaiser notes in his book, "Landmarks in the Landscape," on the historic architecture of Western national parks, to be published next year summer by David R. Godine. Instead of placing the hotel across the visitors' approaching view of the Old Faithful, Reamer skewed the inn in relation to the entry drive to allow an unobstructed view of the geyser.</p>
        <p>The rooms, however, are a mixed proposition. Of the hotels' 327 rooms, only 90 are in the Old House, the original historic structure. The rest are in two modern, rather antiseptic wings. During a four-night stay, we spent three nights in the Old House -- in a two-bedroom suite that included a copper-topped Arts and Crafts vanity in the bathroom -- and one in the west wing. The older room was like a miniature log cabin, with brass beds and rough-hewn plank walls. Unfortunately, we arrived late in the season, in late September, and the room, which was not winterized, was freezing (the season runs from May 7 through Oct. 9). The plank walls were charming, but you could hear every heave of the staircase outside. Still, it was worth it. We could see geysers outside the window, which looked like the earth breathing in the clear morning light. Beyond were hillsides still blackened from the forest fire -- pincushions of charred spikes fragile as fishbones, as if the landscape were a movie and someone had turned the color off.</p>
        <p>Our room in the modern wing was basic and clean but had the sanitized character of a bad college dorm. (Mercifully, T. W. Recreational Services, which operates the hotel, is in the throes of renovating the wings to make them more architecturally compatible with the old.) As of this writing, however, the hallways were institutional-looking and decorated with vending machines. The bellman took care of our room change while we were off hiking.</p>
        <p>IF you are traveling with a small child, as we were, the first thing that arrives at your table in the cacophonous dining room is a highchair tray wrapped in plastic, along with with saltines and a bib. Breakfast is most efficiently accomplished by a buffet (am I the only one who loathes buffets?), although menu service is available. One of the more elegant dinners we had, relatively speaking, was a pork loin with polenta and pepper cream sauce. But there was also the Stouffers' lasagna and the chicken teriyaki with the canned pineapple slice.</p>
        <p>For us, the presence of so many young families was reassuring, not only in the dining room but on the hiking trail, where our 1 1/2-year-old son Jake, the Houdini of shoelaces, kept losing his shoes, which were always returned by fellow hikers.</p>
        <p>The best part of the inn, besides the architecture, is its location. You can marvel at rainbows glinting off Old Faithful's mists from the hotel balcony, then walk to lesser-known thermal spots (my favorites were the "paint pots," fearsome bubbling cauldrons that look and sound like God gargling).</p>
        <p>The Inn is the place to hear the scuttlebutt about goings-on in the animal world. In the lobby one morning, we overheard two rangers sharing intelligence about a couple of grizzly cubs that had been spotted near Mount Washburn, about an hour and a half's drive from the hotel. (Organized ranger-led activities are available at the registration desk.) We headed toward Dunraven Pass -- a rather harrowing stretch of road known locally as the "Mae West curve" -- and suddenly the traffic was bumper-to-bumper grizzly-gawkers. "We need to find the driver of the blue and white van from Arizona!" Colette Daigle-Berg, the hapless park ranger, was bellowing into her megaphone, something they probably didn't teach her at ranger school.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, a battery of about a hundred wildlife photographers, professional and amateur, had gathered with gonzo camera lenses to record the bears, who were munching on yampa, a flowering plant, their silvery backs glimmering in the midday sun. The scene was indeed "just like National Geographic," as one of the photographers said. They were celebrity bears, Yellowstone Elvises.</p>
        <p>Later, we left bear country and the evergreen forests and snow patches of the higher elevations and headed toward the Lamar Valley, in the northeast corner of the park. This is Teddy Roosevelt's range land, a little-traveled landscape of undulating hills and sage brush plains.</p>
        <p>It was midafternoon when we began a three-mile hike in the river valley, past golden groves of aspen, the breezes whipping through the buffalo grass. In the autumnal light the Lamar River was cerulean blue.</p>
        <p>At dusk, driving back to the Inn, the geysers encircling Yellowstone Lake looked like smoke signals from indian campfires. On the Jackson Hole, Wyo., radio station, the music was interrupted by a special news bulletin announcing that the high school golf team was late and would not be home for supper. We headed back to creaky rustic splendor, feeling blissfully remote.</p>
        <p>Reservations at the Old Faithful Inn may be made through T. W. Recreational Services, Post Office Box 165, Yellowstone, Wyo. 82190; (307) 344-7311, fax (307) 344-7456. A double room with bath runs from $60 to $95.</p>
