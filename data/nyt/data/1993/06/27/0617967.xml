        <p>EARLIER this month, Milestone Educational Institute of Cambridge, Mass., a commercial tour operator, abruptly shut its doors, leaving an estimated 5,000 students and teachers without the tickets to Europe or hotel vouchers they paid for long ago. The Massachusetts Attorney General said complaints received immediately from schools in 27 states involving 1,160 would-be travelers showed the school groups had lost $2.4 million. When all the complaints are gathered authorities expect a total above $6.5 million.</p>
        <p>Massachusetts has moved against Milestone and its owner, Christopher DuMello Kenyon, who was served with lawsuit papers in England in mid-June, according to Leslie Davies, an assistant Attorney General. The state got a restraining order to keep Mr. Kenyon from again selling travel arrangements in Massachusetts and sued for refunds to clients, plus civil penalties and costs.</p>

        <p>EARLIER this month, Milestone Educational Institute of Cambridge, Mass., a commercial tour operator, abruptly shut its doors, leaving an estimated 5,000 students and teachers without the tickets to Europe or hotel vouchers they paid for long ago. The Massachusetts Attorney General said complaints received immediately from schools in 27 states involving 1,160 would-be travelers showed the school groups had lost $2.4 million. When all the complaints are gathered authorities expect a total above $6.5 million.</p>
        <p>Massachusetts has moved against Milestone and its owner, Christopher DuMello Kenyon, who was served with lawsuit papers in England in mid-June, according to Leslie Davies, an assistant Attorney General. The state got a restraining order to keep Mr. Kenyon from again selling travel arrangements in Massachusetts and sued for refunds to clients, plus civil penalties and costs.</p>
        <p>Hopes for recovery of the students' money also hinge on another legal action, this one concerning a venture capitalist, Allen Milton of Boston, who lent Mr. Kenyon $:425,000 a year ago. Mr. Milton's lawyer, John Monaghan of Sherburne, Powers &amp; Needham in Boston, said that at Mr. Milton's request, the court appointed a receiver for Milestone, who will act on behalf of all the creditors, making a list of Milestone's assets and a priority order of creditors. The creditors will include Mr. Milton, the students and some airlines. Continental, for example, honored fewer than 100 tickets that were printed and distributed by Milestone before June 3 but never paid for, according to a spokesman.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, students are trying to cope with a big disappointment. The stories from Concord High School in Elkhart, Ind., are typical. Jane L. Duell, a French teacher who was to be one of four group leaders, said that many of the students had started saving money for the trip far ahead. One student who had saved his paper-route money for three years for a car said he had decided he would have many years to have a car, but only one chance to make a trip to Europe with his classmates. Each of the 31 students from Elkhart and nearby Goshen paid $1,879 to Milestone by March 1, the deadline.</p>
        <p>According to Mrs. Duell, Milestone said that the tickets, on British Airways, and vouchers would be in her hands seven days before June 7, the date the group was to fly out of Chicago, or Milestone would forfeit $500. This did not seem terribly late to her because, on a previous trip booked through E.F. Educational Tours, also in Cambridge, the tickets hadn't arrived until four days before departure. Jean Ahonen of E.F. said the company liked to do things farther ahead but that four days was not unheard of.</p>
        <p>This year, Mrs. Duell got worried about two weeks before departure, but her contact at Milestone pointed out that the backpacks, journals and luggage tags had arrived on time. The Milestone employee also suggested that Mrs. Duell call British Airways to check, and indeed the reservations were in place.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Duell's contact at Milestone called her at the end of May because the guaranteed delivery day, May 31, was a holiday, and the $500 penalty was at issue. But the tickets did not come by June 2; on June 3, when Mrs. Duell called, she heard a recording saying Milestone had shut in "severe financial difficulties."  Reading the Fine Print</p>
        <p>"My stomach was churning all day Friday," Mrs. Duell recalled. "The students had examinations then, and I couldn't tell them bad news before they took the tests. They were so excited. We called all the parents, and the kids walked into the library after school, and there were their parents -- with grim faces."</p>
        <p>"I keep asking myself," Mrs. Duell said, "where were the warning bells? What indication did I miss?"</p>
        <p>The bells were far off, and could be heard only with the help of sophisticated questions. Whom was she dealing with? The largest name printed on the brochure was American Leadership Study Group, often referred to as A.L.S.G., which she said was described in smaller type as "a division of Milestone Educational Institute." The brochure said A.L.S.G. had been offering tours to Europe for 25 years, and she said a fellow teacher reported he had used them with no problem. Vanessa Souther in Kissimmee, Fla., who was taking a group of eight, said she had used A.L.S.G. in 1978 and '79 and therefore went with them again this year.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Duell, Ms. Souther and other teachers in the 27 states were not dealing with a company with a 25-year track record. Mr. Kenyon incorporated Milestone in 1991, according to the Massachusetts complaint, and then bought A.L.S.G., a failed company in receivership, in essence a name. Mr. Kenyon used the A.L.S.G. number for entree to the airlines' clearinghouse for payments, but this number went into default, and he got a new number as Milestone. The teachers were dealing not with A.L.S.G. but with Mr. Kenyon.</p>
        <p>A result was that Jim Powers, British Airways manager for tour operator and student accounts, decided that B.A. would not allow Milestone to print the airline's tickets, a common practice among airlines dealing with agencies in the clearinghouse, but had to present certified checks to get the tickets. It was essentially a new company and "it had to prove itself," Mr. Powers said in an interview. "It was the earlier default, and a combination of telltales," he said. "My job is to protect the airline company."</p>
        <p>Some B.A. tickets were paid for by check and delivered to student groups. The airline is now in the process of making alternative arrangements and providing refunds. (Michael Insulaco at  [ 800 ]  654-6150 is in charge of this work.) British Airways held reservations for 3,500 Milestone travelers of the 5,000 total Milestone was scheduling this summer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers said that anyone with doubts about the reliability of a tour company should ask the company if it is authorized to print tickets for the airline to be used. Mr. Powers said that so far as student tour companies were concerned, British Airways had a long relationship with A.C.I.S., the American Council for International Studies, in Boston and with Falcon Travel-Cultural Heritage Tours in Philadelphia, and a three-year relationship with E.F. Educational Tours.  Taking Preventive Measures</p>
        <p>So the question is, what financial security does an unknown company offer to a group organizer before all the money is turned over? There are three good alternatives: use of an escrow account to hold the money until the trip is over; a performance bond, or an insurance policy that pays off if the trip is not delivered. Each of the companies Mr. Powers mentioned uses one of these protections.</p>
        <p>Michael I. Eizenberg, president of A.C.I.S., said his company has an insurance policy that guarantees refunds -- up to a total of $5 million -- if the company does not deliver. Falcon uses an escrow account at the Philadelphia National Bank, according to Mort O'Shea, assistant to the president. E.F., according to Ms. Ahonen, uses an escrow account at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in New York.</p>
        <p>The United States Tour Operators Association backs its members with a $5 million protection plan underwritten by the Chubb group. Robert E. Whitley, the president, said that Milestone could not have joined because it had not operated for three years under the same ownership. A.C.I.S., Falcon and E.F. do not belong.</p>
        <p>Contiki, a member of U.S.T.O.A. that normally specializes in travel for people 18 to 35, along with A.C.I.S., the tour operator Globus Gateway and others, is offering reduced-price arrangements for the people who lost their money to Milestone. In Elkhart, the teachers and students are trying to learn what the community can do to make up for lost dreams and money.</p>
