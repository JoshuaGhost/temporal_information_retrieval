        <p>In the Crestwood section of this city with a racially troubled past, neighbors grumble to each other about the newcomers, about the graffiti on a suburban fence, the lawn that was brashly invaded by bicycle riders, the blaring music that jarred a languorous afternoon.</p>
        <p>But such complaints also mask a collective sigh of relief.</p>
        <p>For the homeowners of this leafy thicket of colonials and tudors acknowledge that things have not worked out as badly as they feared in the year since 48 low-income families moved into a cluster of functional brick town houses constructed under a Federal desegregation order. In the Crestwood complex and in four other court-ordered town house developments in the city, there have been no crime to speak of, no racial clashes and no significant white flight, city officials say. Home prices have dropped, but they have done so almost everywhere in Westchester County.</p>
        <p>Still, residents say their fears have not been put to rest.</p>
        <p>In a new stage in the 13-year-old Yonkers housing desegregation case, Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court in Manhattan is weighing plans to place subsidized tenants in private buildings, either new construction or existing housing, in largely middle-class areas of Yonkers. Longtime residents are worried that as many as four new developments could spring up within a mile of the 48-unit Dr. James F. X. O'Rourke Town Houses in Crestwood, "tipping" the neighborhood's racial balance and leading to a white exodus.</p>
        <p>"We don't want to be saturated," says Eleanor Bourke, head of the Whitman Homeowners Association, whose 200 predominantly white-owned homes surround the public-housing site. "If more housing comes here we could have a problem."</p>
        <p>The nub of the latest stage of litigation involves the creation of Federal and state subsidized apartments for families who earn $67,000 or less in privately run buildings. Mayor Terence M. Zaleski, proclaiming a change of heart from the city's rebellious history, said he wants to settle its integration obligations by finding 450 apartments in existing cooperatives, building 115 new ones and renovating 144 apartments in the largely black and Hispanic section of southwest Yonkers.</p>
        <p>The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which helped bring a 1980 lawsuit charging intentional segregation in locating public housing in southwest Yonkers, contends that reliance on existing apartments is impractical because cooperative boards are reluctant to sell to subsidized tenants. It wants a far more new construction.</p>
        <p>Judge Sand could also select from options put forward by the court-appointed Fair Housing Implementation Office that call for as many as 1,700 apartments and houses on 18 sites, including four near the O'Rourke town houses.</p>
        <p>On June 17, Judge Sand indicated in an interim opinion that he thought Yonkers could find no more than 250 homes in existing cooperatives and would have to rely more heavily on building new apartments. On Monday, the judge is to hear arguments on how much and what kind of new construction should be undertaken. Question of Class</p>
        <p>It is additional construction that worries Mrs. Bourke and her neighbors. A resolute woman in her 60's who has lived in Crestwood for eight years, Mrs. Bourke, who is white, denied that she was ever opposed to the presence of black families, pointing out that several already belong to her association. "The attitude was that if you could afford to buy a house, you were welcome," she said.</p>
        <p>Rather, she and her neighbors suggested, there were questions on the mixing of people of disparate economic classes, of people who had bought homes with heavily subsidized renters, many of whom are on welfare. Helene Ellen, who recently sold a house near Mrs. Bourke, said she also resented that the town houses swallowed up a Little League field and a tennis court.</p>
        <p>But much resentment seems to be based on misinformation. Homeowners have complained that the O'Rourke tenants were given lawn furniture, air-conditioners and lawn mowers, for example. But the washer-dryers belong to the Municipal Housing Authority, housing officials said. Whatever lawn furniture and lawn mowers the O'Rourke tenants have, they say they bought themselves. The apartments come with slots for air-conditioners, but not the appliances themselves.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Jones, a 43-year-old neighbor of Mrs. Bourke who is black, said she had barely noticed the presence of the newcomers. But she did notice how many white neighbors stopped her to explain that their opposition to public housing was not based on race.</p>
        <p>"It's like they owed me an explanation," said Ms. Jones, who recently retired as a New York City Transit Authority train operator.</p>
        <p>Still, she wondered how much thought Judge Sand has given to the practicality of mixing different economic backgrounds. "Is he willing to have low-income people in his neighborhood?" she said. "He's making that decision for everyone else. But is he willing to do that?"</p>
        <p>She said her prime concern was that additional housing would draw the traffic and hubbub that made her leave the Inwood section of Manhattan. "I don't want it crowded," she said. "I lived crowded before. I don't want it again." A Welcome Change</p>
        <p>At the O'Rourke town houses, the tenants also have complaints, particularly about the small size of the rooms, but they say they appreciate the chance to be away from the incessant gunfire and tantalizing drugs of the projects.</p>
        <p>Janice French, who moved last June from the William A. Schlobohm Houses, a cluster of eight public high-rises in southwest Yonkers, said much of the crime in the high-rises was caused by intruders or guests in buildings too teeming for control. "You can't stop people from having company," she said. "Here everybody knows everybody."</p>
        <p>One thing both sides acknowledge is that there has been little true mingling among adults, the tacit goal of the integration lawsuit, although some town house children play with those living in a nearby development of 1,083 garden apartments called Crestwood Lake. Forty-three percent of that development's population was minority members, including many receiving Federal subsidies, even before the town houses were built.</p>
        <p>"We try to get along," said Mrs. Bourke of her relations with the O'Rourke tenants. "We're not blood brothers. I don't invite them into my home and they don't invite me into theirs."</p>
        <p>Some opponents of housing integration have drawn parallels with Judge Sand's allied efforts to integrate Yonkers 32 schools. Since 1986, voluntary busing has created far more racially mixed schools, but the citywide numbers of white students has declined to 7,080, from 9,989 in 1985-86. Since then, the number of black students has climbed to 5,750, from 4,557, and the number of Hispanic students to 7,416, from 4,289.</p>
        <p>Jerilynn Fierstein, a spokesman for the Yonkers Board of Education, said studies have shown that white flight specifically attributable to desegregation "has not been significant." The racial changes, she said, are the result of broader demographic shifts that have seen a doubling of Hispanics in a decade and an aging of the white population.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, the arrival of the town houses has created a sturdy, if diplomatic, relationship between Mrs. Bourke and Valerie Carroll, the tenant supervisor for Yonkers Municipal Housing Authority, who is black. Whenever any homeowners have a complaint about the town houses, Mrs. Bourke will visit Mrs. Carroll and she said she had been pleased with the quick responses.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Carroll complained that many homeowners too readily assume that if there is a blight like graffiti, it must have been caused by the town house dwellers. "How would they know it was one of our people?" she said. "Our people don't walk around with T-shirts saying 'I live in Dr. James F. X. O'Rourke houses.' "</p>
        <p>She added: "I heard a little girl here say: 'It's like the country. It's wide open spaces.' The children can ride their bikes. They can roller skate. This is something everyone has a right to as long as they can take care of it."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bourke said that she felt she had patched the neighborhood together and that she worried most about panics like those decades ago in the Bronx, the embarkation point for many Yonkers citizens. She said she was grateful that a weak economy is frustrating home sales and hoped that those considering selling their homes would hold on to see that the neighborhood has not been hurt by the town house tenants.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Carroll understands that some people might resent that the government pays so much of her tenants' rents. But she asks: "Why should they begrudge a person for moving up a little. I can understand their aspirations and anxieties. They should be able to understand our aspirations and anxieties, too."</p>
