        <p>For too long, New York City school custodians have wielded power and privilege far out of proportion to their numbers -- and beyond the scope of any sensible labor-management pact. Now the State Assembly has tried to cut them down to size. The Senate needs to follow suit.</p>
        <p>Custodians function as both city employees and independent contractors. Each of the 900 custodians administers an annual allowance, based on the size of the school, for supplies, equipment and salaries for the custodial staff.</p>
        <p>But contracts between the Board of Education and the custodians' union dating back to the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's skewed the balance of power. Custodians were required to clean classrooms only every other day and to mop cafeterias only once a week. They often refused to perform routine maintenance like painting window frames.</p>
        <p>A 1988 contract made some important changes, like reducing the outrageous "opening fees" custodians charged outside groups for using school facilities during non-class hours. But it took only a half step toward giving principals sensible management control over custodians. And it failed to stop custodians from working at private jobs on school time.</p>
        <p>While negotiations over a new contract have dragged on, Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez has pushed for legislation to make custodians more productive and accountable. Recently the Assembly passed a bill giving principals the authority to evaluate custodians based on whether they keep their schools clean and make timely repairs. The evaluations would then be used to determine whether custodians were promoted or transferred. In addition, the bill would further reduce opening fees and prevent custodians from making a profit on them.</p>
        <p>Now the Assembly's willingness to take on the custodians needs to be duplicated in the Senate -- and by the new chancellor.</p>
