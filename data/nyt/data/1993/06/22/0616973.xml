        <p>To increase competition in the market for medical care, White House officials are recommending that the health-insurance industry be stripped of its longstanding immunity from Federal antitrust law.</p>
        <p>The proposal reflects the concern of Administration officials and consumer advocates who fear that a handful of big insurance companies may soon dominate the industry, especially if Congress approves the plan Mr. Clinton is developing to overhaul the nation's health-care system.</p>
        <p>Under the Clinton plan, to be sent to Congress later this year, consumers and small businesses would band together to buy coverage from large networks of doctors and hospitals. Many networks would be organized by insurance companies.</p>
        <p>"You don't want a cartel of insurers to be able to set prices or limit the terms of coverage free from antitrust scrutiny," said an official who has worked closely with Hillary Rodham Clinton in developing the Administration's proposal. Mr. Clinton is expected to make the antitrust proposal part of his health-care plan. 'Practices Are Shielded'</p>
        <p>Linda A. Lipsen, chief lobbyist for Consumers Union, endorsed the proposal. "We have been opposed to the antitrust exemption for years," she said today. "Health-insurance companies decide not to provide coverage for people in certain ZIP codes. They decide what diseases will be covered and which ones won't. But these practices are shielded from antitrust scrutiny."</p>
        <p>Insurance companies generally want to retain the antitrust exemption, but some say they are willing to consider changes, if they can share data on claims and continue some other joint activities.</p>
        <p>In the 1992 Presidential campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would "take on the big insurance companies." But big insurers see a potentially lucrative new market in the health plan emerging from the White House.</p>
        <p>Five big insurers, Aetna, Cigna, Metropolitan Life, Prudential and Travelers, have formed an alliance to promote the idea of managed competition, which is at the heart of Mr. Clinton's plan. In theory, under this plan, doctors and hospitals would cooperate within a network, and the networks would compete with one another. Central Role Foreseen</p>
        <p>"We expect to have a central role in forming these networks," said Lawrence P. English, president of the Cigna Employee Benefits Companies, a division of the Cigna Corporation. "We intend to employ physicians, have an ownership interest in hospitals and run the networks through which health care is delivered in markets all over the country."</p>
        <p>White House officials and many insurance executives predict that Mr. Clinton's plan will lead to consolidation in the health-insurance industry, as scores of smaller companies merge or fail.</p>
        <p>The insurance business has been largely exempt from Federal antitrust law since 1945. The Supreme Court ruled in 1944 that insurance was interstate commerce subject to Federal antitrust law. But the insurance industry won a reprieve nine months later, when Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act.</p>
        <p>Congress intended to give the industry a temporary three-year exemption. But courts have interpreted an ambiguous section of the 1945 law as perpetuating the exemption. Little Competition Seen</p>
        <p>Insurers won the exemption by arguing that they faced financial ruin if subjected to antitrust laws, saying they needed to be able to pool data on claims and losses to calculate rates properly. Since then, insurance has been regulated almost entirely by the states, and the quality of supervision varies.</p>
        <p>In a recent report, the House Judiciary Committee said, "Lax oversight of the insurance industry, coupled with no possibility of antitrust enforcement, has led to the proliferation of anticompetitive practices." State officials told the committee that the 1945 law had bred a culture of collusion, leaving insurers free to fix rates, carve up markets, restrict coverage and insist that consumers buy products like prescription drugs from selected suppliers.</p>
        <p>Insurers deny engaging in such practices.</p>
        <p>Many of the companies want to retain the antitrust exemption. Russel P. Iuculano, vice president of Metropolitan Life, said, "MetLife opposes any legislation to repeal or modify the McCarran-Ferguson Act."</p>
        <p>Hospitals and doctors have asked Congress to relax antitrust laws to let them collaborate. Mrs. Clinton's task force agreed that doctors and hospitals should be given clearer guidance from the agencies responsible for antitrust enforcement, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. But it concluded that there was no need for Congress to amend the antitrust laws to permit greater collaboration by doctors and hospitals. Administration officials said this guidance could be provided through policy statements and swifter replies to hospitals seeking advice on mergers, joint ventures and other matters.</p>
