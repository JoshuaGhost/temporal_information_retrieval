        <p>Dwight Gooden, after complaining of stiffness in his right shoulder, will be held out of his scheduled start against the Montreal Expos tonight at Shea Stadium. He will be replaced by Anthony Young, which will give that right-hander a head start on what might be history as he attempts to end his streak of 22 straight decisions without a victory.</p>
        <p>Gooden, who was rocked for six runs in three innings last Thursday night in Pittsburgh, was examined by Dr. David Dines yesterday. The discomfort was officially termed minor, a designation that has come to mean increasingly little over the years with the Mets. Gooden will be examined again today.</p>

        <p>Dwight Gooden, after complaining of stiffness in his right shoulder, will be held out of his scheduled start against the Montreal Expos tonight at Shea Stadium. He will be replaced by Anthony Young, which will give that right-hander a head start on what might be history as he attempts to end his streak of 22 straight decisions without a victory.</p>
        <p>Gooden, who was rocked for six runs in three innings last Thursday night in Pittsburgh, was examined by Dr. David Dines yesterday. The discomfort was officially termed minor, a designation that has come to mean increasingly little over the years with the Mets. Gooden will be examined again today.</p>
        <p>The emergency reshuffling of the rotation may work in Young's favor. The 27-year-old, one defeat short of tying the major league record for consecutive losses, set in 1911, was set to face Dennis Martinez, one of the Montreal aces, tomorrow afternoon. Instead, Young, 0-8, will pitch against the 3-5 Chris Nabholz.</p>
        <p>Gooden was told after his rotator cuff surgery in September of 1991 that the rest of his career would be a fight to keep his shoulder stable. Last season, he missed some time in the second half before returning to finish the year strongly. This season, Gooden (7-6) has regularly pitched with power and effectiveness deep into his starts.</p>
