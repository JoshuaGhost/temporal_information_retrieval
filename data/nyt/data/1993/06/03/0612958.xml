        <p>Trying to show a tougher approach to enforcing environmental laws, the Clinton Administration last month levied an $11.1 million penalty against a company that falsely reported how much pollution it produced. It was the largest civil fine ever obtained under the Clean Air Act.</p>
        <p>But in the days after Janet Reno, the Attorney General, and Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, jointly proclaimed what they said was a "loud and clear message" to polluters, some members of Congress, state officials and independent environmental experts have wondered just what sort of message was being sent.</p>
        <p>These critics said the penalty against the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, the nation's largest manufacturer of wood-fiber construction panels, was minor compared with the enormous market advantage the company had gained by breaking environmental laws in reporting pollution from plants making waferboard. Despite what investigators said was strong evidence that company officials had deliberately submitted false information to the Government, the Administration did not bring criminal charges. 'A Message to Industry'</p>
        <p>"This case is a prime example of how a company can dominate a market by avoiding the costs of complying with environmental laws," said Jonathan Turley, a law professor and director of the Environmental Crimes Project at George Washington University here.</p>
        <p>"They have enjoyed a long period of high profits and rapid expansion because of their falsification of records and misleading of regulators," he added. "To allow Louisiana-Pacific to simply internalize those costs now and not face criminal liability sends a message to industry that environmental violations remain simply the cost of doing business."</p>
        <p>Louisiana-Pacific, which is based in Portland, Ore., said in a statement last week that the penalty would not affect the company's earnings. Harry A. Merlo, the company's chairman and president, said he was "pleased with the settlement."</p>
        <p>And Barry Lacter, a spokesman for the company, which had sales of $2.2 billion last year, denied that Lousiana-Pacific deliberately set out to mislead state and Federal regulators.</p>
        <p>The company's waferboard sales last year totaled more than $500 million, Mr. Lacter said. Investment analysts say the company now controls 43 percent of the $1.2 billion waferboard market, which is one of the fastest-growing sectors of the construction materials industry.</p>
        <p>The case involved 14 plants in 11 states but was focused mainly on the 11 new plants the company built in eight states in the 1980's to manufacture waferboard, a substitute for plywood made from wafers of wood glued and pressed together. Though waferboard can be made from less-expensive wood like aspen and scrub pine, carpenters say it is as strong and nearly as versatile as plywood.</p>
        <p>But the process of drying the wafers in a huge oven, then gluing and pressing them into panels, produces millions of pounds of carbon monoxide and toxic air pollution, state environmental officials say. Federal authorities said in interviews that in every case, states did not discover how dirty Lousiana-Pacific's plants were until after they were operating.</p>
        <p>The Federal Clean Air Act of 1970, which is administered by the states, requires manufacturers, when applying for construction and operating permits, to say precisely how much air pollution new plants will produce. In addition, the law requires companies operating in regions with the cleanest air, like the forested areas where Louisiana-Pacific built its waferboard plants, to undergo more stringent review and to take special precautions if their plants each year produce more than 250 tons of dust, carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxide. Underestimating Pollution</p>
        <p>Officials in the eight states said the company had avoided the more stringent review by deliberately underestimating, often by thousands of tons a year, how much pollution the new waferboard plants would produce. The states are Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin.</p>
        <p>By filing inaccurate information, the authorities said, Louisiana-Pacific consistently beat its competitors in getting new waferboard plants into operation. It was also able to avoid the multimillion-dollar expense of installing and operating pollution control equipment that was required of its competitors.</p>
        <p>In Georgia, for example, state air pollution technicians found in 1990 that a year-old Lousiana-Pacific waferboard plant in Jackson County was pouring 1,500 tons of volatile organic chemicals into the air each year, more than six times the amount the company said it would emit.</p>
        <p>The violation was discovered after the Georgia authorities noticed that the International Paper Company, a competitor that had applied to build a similar waferboard plant in Georgia at the same time, accurately described the amount of air pollution it would produce. Georgia fined Louisiana-Pacific $400,000 for the violation, but the company had its plant operating a year before International Paper.</p>
        <p>In Maine, Louisiana-Pacific sought construction and environmental permits in 1981 for a plant that it said would produce 240 tons of waferboard a day. The company told the state that air pollution would be minimal at such production levels. But in a routine inspection in 1988, the Maine authorities found that the plant was producing 400 tons of waferboard a day, and that air pollution was far above the levels approved in the original permit.</p>
        <p>Last summer, according to Kevin Macdonald, a state environmental specialist, Louisiana-Pacific paid a $350,000 penalty for that violation. E.P.A. Aide Praises Penalty</p>
        <p>In a news conference announcing the settlement on May 24, Ms. Reno and Ms. Browner said that under a consent decree, Louisiana-Pacific agreed to install $70 million in pollution control equipment at 11 plants in nine states in 1994 and 1995. The Attorney General added that for companies that do not play by the rules, "we want them to pay something more than just what it costs."</p>
        <p>Officials in the E.P.A.'s enforcement division said the Louisiana-Pacific case, begun in 1991 by the Bush Administration, was a marked change from its earlier approach in that it sought penalties against a company's plants in many states instead of acting against individual plants.</p>
        <p>"It is very easy to sit back and poke at a case and say it could have been done better," said Robert Van Heuvelen, the environmental agency's director of civil enforcment. "This is a wonderful penalty result. It's a wonderful environmental result. To say we didn't do enough is to fail to recognize the value of what happened here."</p>
        <p>At issue for critics, though, is whether the civil penalty fit the violations, and why criminal charges were not brought. Representative John L. Mica, a freshman Republican from Florida who is a member of the House Government Operations environment subcommittee, has called for a Congressional investigation.</p>
        <p>Companies with criminal pollution convictions under the Clean Air Act face immediate loss of the right to sell products to be used in any Federal contract.</p>
