        <p>WHEN the Bay Street Theater Festival opened in Sag Harbor last July its founders knew that they wanted to "revitalize the theater experience on the Island."</p>
        <p>Period.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>WHEN the Bay Street Theater Festival opened in Sag Harbor last July its founders knew that they wanted to "revitalize the theater experience on the Island."</p>
        <p>Period.</p>
        <p>And it worked.</p>
        <p>The season's two plays were sellouts. "Men's Lives" by Joe Pintauro is scheduled to return in August, and "Three Hotels" by Jon Robin Baitz moved to the Circle Repertory Off Broadway, where it continues to run, a critical and popular high point of the season in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Now that they can confidently talk of a track record, the executive producer, Stephen Hamilton, is "looking back, taking stock and refocusing."</p>
        <p>"And articulating our mission," added his wife, Emma Walton, the co-artistic director of the theater.</p>
        <p>Although "Full Gallop," a one-woman play about Diana Vreeland and starring Mary Louise Wilson, had four sold-out performances over the Memorial Day weekend, that was just a warm-up. "We weren't ready to open the summer season," Ms. Walton said.  Second of Three Phases</p>
        <p>In the last two weeks seats have been added, a new projection booth installed and a portion of the balcony removed for better sightlines, all part of what is being called Phase 2 of renovations. Phase 3 is to come.</p>
        <p>Phase 2 is expected to be completed in time for the first production, opening on Wednesday, "Alone at the Beach," a comedy by Richard Dresser that happens to be about summer shares in the Hamptons. Judge Reinhold, Mia Dillon and Julie Boyd are in the seven-member cast. The play runs through July 5.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dresser, who may be best known for writing "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," the television series, has lesser-known but widely produced plays among his credits, including "Better Days" and "The Downside."</p>
        <p>From July 21 through Aug. 9 the festival will present the premiere of "Desdemona" by Paula Vogel. "It's a bit of a whimsical women's locker-room play," said Ms. Walton. "A classic from another perspective, that of Desdemona, Emila and Bianca."</p>
        <p>Ms. Vogel's last two plays were the acclaimed and often-performed "Baltimore Waltz," written in tribute to the author's brother, who died of AIDS, and the critically drubbed "And Baby Makes Seven." Each had Circle Rep productions with Cherry Jones, who will also appear in "Desdemona."</p>
        <p>"Our production of 'Desdemona' is an organic extension of our developing relationship with the Circle Rep," said Ms. Walton.</p>
        <p>The credit in the Bay Street program for "Desdemona" reads that the theater is producing the play in association with Circle Rep. When "Desdemona" opens in New York, where it is scheduled for next season, the credit will be reversed.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the Circle Rep program for "Three Hotels" includes an acknowledgment to the Bay Street "contribution to the play's development," but is not listed as co-producer on the title page.  Plea for a Way of Life</p>
        <p>Mr. Pintauro's play, which pleads for the baymen's threatened way of life and livelihood, is returning, because "at least as many people who didn't see it wanted to, but couldn't,"</p>
        <p>"And the issue hasn't gone away," Mr. Hamilton said.</p>
        <p>"It's only gotten worse," Ms. Walton added.</p>
        <p>"Men's Lives," which Mr. Pintauro adapted from the book by Peter Matthiesen, runs from Aug. 18 through Sept. 6.</p>
        <p>On a recent afternoon of Phase 2, Mr. Hamilton recalled: "This time last year, we were all in our overalls, the risers were still under construction, and we were looking at purple walls, a black ceiling, black windows and nasty beer-stained carpeting."</p>
        <p>"This was a roller disco in the 80's, filled with loud music, drugs and selfishness. This theater represents a return to real values. It reflects a need for people to have more meaning in their lives."</p>
        <p>"Now that we have gained credibility we can assert ourselves," Ms. Walton said. "And our mission represents a collective vision," an allusion to Sybil Christopher, the co-artistic director, and other members of the administrative staff. "Eleven of us have a voice and play an active role in collaborative initiation."</p>
        <p>The mission statement makes nonspecific references to eclectic community responsibility, freedom from commercial pressure, a collective theatrical experience and the exercising of "fiscal responsibility so that our work might be defined by our imagination and not our resources."  Benefit Scheduled July 10</p>
        <p>Among Bay Street's well-known resources is its apparent celebrity support. Reinforcing the value of names, the benefit on July 10 -- Alec Baldwin and Beth Rudin Dee Woody are the hosts -- will include a "fantasy auction" with prizes like an evening at the opera with Joanne Woodward, walk-ons in the new Sidney Lumet film and in "Les Miserables," an answering-machine message to be recorded by Lauren Bacall and a pair of theater tickets for a winner and a date, with Mr. Baldwin and his date as companions.</p>
        <p>And to reinforce the theater's glitter a lecture series, by Wendy Wasserstein on July 27 and Mike Nichols on Aug. 24, was added to the season and quickly sold out. "Our old friends are part of the renaissance of theater here," Ms. Walton said. "And Wendy's a new friend."</p>
