        <p>FOR anyone familiar with the horror stories of Air Force procurement -- $500 ashtrays, $700 toilet seats and $1,000 hammers -- it was easy to be apprehensive when the service announced in 1991 that it was letting out a contract covering as many as 300,000 advanced personal computers.</p>
        <p>Now, more than two years after the Air Force opened its Desktop IV competition with a vow that the contract would be a model for streamlined high-technology procurement, the first batch of computers is almost ready for delivery.</p>
        <p>The good news is that the Air Force -- and thus the public -- actually got a good deal on the $724 million, three-year contract, under which the whole Defense Department may buy equipment. This despite all the delays caused by bureaucratic fiat and red tape, repeated protests from losing bidders, and some bombast from pork-barrel politicians. Instead of paying premium prices for outdated technology, the military is getting top-quality commercial systems at bargain prices.</p>
        <p>And the Desktop IV experience may even offer some lessons for private-sector businesses.</p>
        <p>"Let's face it, if corporations bought computers the same way," said Robert A. Dornan, senior vice president of Federal Sources Inc., "our competitiveness in the world economy would crumble."</p>
        <p>"But in the long run," Mr. Dornan hastened to add, "Desktop IV was a significant success. The Air Force tried a lot of new things."</p>
        <p>"Instead of demanding detailed, nitpicky stuff, it called for open specifications," continued Mr. Dornan, whose consulting firm, based in McLean, Va., specialized in government technology contracts. "Instead of low price, it looked for best value. It used electronic bulletin boards for bidding. And what it wound up with was not quite state of the art, but pretty darned close."</p>
        <p>Two companies, the Zenith Data Systems Corporation of Buffalo Grove, Ill., and Government Technology Services Inc. of Chantilly, Va., will share the contract. What they won, essentially, is a three-year hunting license to sell personal computers, peripherals and software to various Defense Department and civilian agencies, all under the Air Force umbrella contract.</p>
        <p>Zenith Data, a subsidiary of Groupe Bull of France, appears to have the best chances for bagging Government sales. Unlike most of the original bidders, it proposed computers based on the Intel Corporation's i486 microprocessors. That was a bold step at the time, in May 1991 when the i486 was relatively new, but it paid off as the contract dragged on.</p>
        <p>Government Technology was added to the award after several protesters, including Electronic Data Systems, Apple Computer and the Compuadd Corporation, cried foul over the Air Force's decision to give the contract solely to Zenith Data.</p>
        <p>Government Technology originally bid in the summer of 1991, including 386- and i486-based computers made by Everex Systems Inc., which has since filed for bankruptcy protection. And while 386-based PC's were popular in 1991, today they are considered outdated. Last week, in a highly unusual step, Government Technology asked for permission to revamp its bid, even before the first computers were shipped.</p>
        <p>"Under the terms of the contract, we are allowed to refresh the technology periodically, and we, as did Zenith, plan to take advantage of that," said Deborah M. Tucker, the company's vice president for corporate communications. She declined to say what changes the company wanted to make, but the newspaper Federal Computer Week reported that Government Technology is scrambling to find a PC maker other than Everex. It is also likely that the 386-based offerings will be abandoned. An Air Force decision on the proposed modifications is expected this month.</p>
        <p>Compuadd, along with Sysorex Information Systems Inc. of Falls Church, Va., was the original contract winner. But after protests from losing companies, the Air Force acknowledged that its Standard Systems Center at Gunter Air Force Base, Ala., in its haste to award the contract under a new "fast track" procurement plan, had disqualified all the other bidders on technical grounds -- reportedly for errors as simple as filling out forms incorrectly.</p>
        <p>The Air Force was forced to cancel the contract in January 1992 by the the General Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals and then reopened the bidding. In September, Zenith Data was notified that it was the sole winner.</p>
        <p>Electronic Data Systems, a General Motors subsidiary, led the next round of protests, complaining that Zenith Data's bid had violated the Trade Agreements Act of 1979. That act requires companies to "substantially alter" components purchased from designated foreign countries before they can be sold as finished products to the Government. Although Zenith Data assembled its monitors in the United States, the protestors said, it technically violated the 1979 act. Zenith Data denied the assertion.</p>
        <p>E.D.S., of Dallas, and Compuadd, of Austin, enlisted the aid of the formidable Texas congressional delegation, including Representative J. J. Pickle and Senator Lloyd H. Bentsen, now Treasury Secretary. The Texans argued that because Zenith Data had been sold to a French company, and because the computers were to be used by the military, awarding the contract to Zenith Data posed a national security risk.</p>
        <p>Zenith responded that it had supplied the military with computers used in the Persian Gulf war and had sold more than 500,000 computers to the Government in previous contracts. It also noted that E.D.S. was selling Taiwanese monitors to the Government under another contract.  Even so, an administrative law judge at the G.S.A.'s Board of Contract Appeals upheld the protests.</p>
        <p>Then, last month, E.D.S. and the other protesters dropped their appeals. (Zenith Data acknowledged it had reached a financial agreement with E.D.S., the terms of which were not disclosed.) Government Technology was added as a second supplier.</p>
        <p>Zenith Data recently disclosed details of its Desktop IV bid, which show that the military gets to go shopping at bargain prices. The computers involved are virtually the same as those available to anyone else, but the volume discounts are hefty.</p>
        <p>For example, one Zenith Data computer, to which the Air Force has given the catchy designation CLIN 0003AB, has these specifications:</p>
        <p>An Intel i486DX/33 microprocessor with an upgrade socket for a faster i486 chip, a 400-megabyte hard disk drive, 8 megabytes of system memory, 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch diskette drives, keyboard, mouse, four 16-bit expansion slots, 1 megabyte of video RAM for superior graphics performance, built-in Ethernet networking connectors and a 14-inch multi frequency, non-interlaced color monitor with Super VGA graphics and local-bus video.</p>
        <p>It comes with a suite of Microsoft software: DOS, Windows, Word for Windows, Excel and Powerpoint, plus Polaris Packrat (a personal information manager) and software for connecting to Unix systems, plus a promise of free software upgrades for the life of the contract. The computer is backed by three years of free, worldwide, on-site service and round-the-clock toll-free telephone technical support, seven days a week.</p>
        <p>Price: $2,330.</p>
        <p>According to Zenith Data's Z-Direct sales catalogue, the public can get a Z-Station 433Dh computer for $2,599. It, too, has an i486DX/33 chip and upgrade socket, built-in networking and a Super VGA monitor. But it also has only 4MB of system memory, a 200-MB hard disk drive and a single diskette drive. Forget the $1,000 worth of application software and upgrades offered with CLIN 0003AB, and lop two years off the on-site service contract.</p>
        <p>So what are the lessons for businesses?</p>
        <p>First, it helps to buy in volume, insisting on discounts. Also, "Insist on transparent upgrade capabilities," suggested Robert B. Costello, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Procurement in the Reagan Administration, now a private consultant.</p>
        <p>Instead of writing 100-page specifications that spell out everything down to the type of processor and the number of screws on the computer case -- as the Air Force used to do -- consider an open search for the best value. Zenith Data's machines cost more than the 386's proposed by others, but they provide more power, a longer life span, extra software and service and support.</p>
        <p>In short, don't be fixated on low cost. "Sure, you can choose a computer that costs $100 less, but that $100 can evaporate in one afternoon when a service technician comes to fix something," Mr. Dornan said.</p>
