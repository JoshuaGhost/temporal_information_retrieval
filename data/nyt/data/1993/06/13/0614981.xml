        <p>"ORDINARY events often best convey the true spirit of a trip."</p>
        <p>This line appears in the first pages of "Focus on Travel" (Abbeville Press, $45), a new book by Allen Rokach, a photographer, and Anne Millman, a photography and science writer. In fact, one of the book's main messages is that the ordinary can be dramatic when captured on film.</p>
        <p>The authors encourage the traveler to photograph the taxi driver with the flat tire, the mother playing with children on a park bench, the group of people on a bus waiting for the last tourist to board. The book shows scenes of ordinary events from around the world. And the authors are right: the ordinary can be beautiful, mysterious, confusing, humorous and exciting.</p>
        <p>"Focus on Travel" is filled with quality images on heavy stock paper. Its hundreds of color pictures are practically all by Mr. Rokach, a teacher, a travel photographer and the former director of photography at the New York Botanical Garden. It also has some historical images, most in black and white. The text, by both Ms. Millman and Mr. Rokach, gives encouraging advice that the traveling photographer may want to take to heart.</p>
        <p>In an introduction, Ms. Millman uses a word that has little to do with tools or techniques: "spiritual."</p>
        <p>"What we hope emerges here is not just our long-standing love affair with travel," she writes, "but also our conviction that there is a sensory and spiritual connection between the travel experience and the use of the camera."</p>
        <p>The pictures -- from Bryce Canyon in Utah to a marketplace in Sydney, Australia -- are inspirational. One senses the joy Mr. Rokach experienced in taking them.</p>
        <p>One of the best images is on the front cover, a field of tulips in the Netherlands shot from a high angle, each variety laid out in a long stripe, color after color. On the back cover is a close-up of a New Guinea tribesman's face painted for a ceremony, filled with rich color and details.</p>
        <p>Almost all of the pictures could have been taken with a single-use $10 camera or a single-lens-reflex 35-millimeter camera that costs $1,000.</p>
        <p>The book makes good use of its space. Where there isn't a picture or an instruction, there often are quotes that make one think, explore and wonder. For instance:</p>
        <p>"All light is the best light," Ernst Haas, 1985.</p>
        <p>"Of what use are lens and light to those who lack mind and sight?" Latin inscription, 1589.</p>
        <p>"For me the camera is a sketchbook, an instrument of intuition and spontaneity, the master of the instant," Henri Cartier-Bresson, 1976.</p>
        <p>Imparting photographic ideas and techniques as well as travel wisdom, the authors suggest learning to use the self-timer before leaving home. Yes, pictures of yourself can be great instead of corny. Direct yourself with purpose.</p>
        <p>"If something catches your eye, take the time to consider its potential," the authors write, advising photographers to "imagine the subject from three distinctive perspectives, the overview, the vignette and the detail."</p>
        <p>Should you pose people you meet along the way? The authors prefer "to capture the natural expressions, gestures and actions of our subjects just as they are occurring."</p>
        <p>How does one give excitement to photographs of the countryside? Design with the colors and textures of the land, they say, using the land as a counterpoint to farmhouses, a haystack or the sky.</p>
        <p>Want action? The authors advise finding the waterfront and capturing the perpetual motion that occurs in seaports around the world.</p>
        <p>"Vivid colors are like the sounds of a trumpet," they write, suggesting that you discover what different colors mean in a society and that you learn more about how the film you have been using affects color. They suggest trying out some filters before traveling and looking as carefully at muted colors as at the bright.</p>
        <p>This book can help make you a better photographer, even if you never leave home.</p>
