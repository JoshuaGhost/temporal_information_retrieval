        <p>Reggie Jackson didn't come. Neither did Catfish Hunter or Tom Seaver or Willie Mays. The crowd at Shea Stadium was sparse, and the Oakland A's roster was so short that the A's needed to use a player -- Bill North -- who had not even been on their 1973 World Series team.</p>
        <p>None of that mattered, though, to the 1973 New York Mets. Yesterday, those Mets managed to do what they couldn't in Game 7 of the 1973 World Series -- they beat the Oakland A's.</p>
        <p>More than 25 former major league players gathered at Shea yesterday for the Upper Deck Heroes of Baseball game, a contest that pitted the two 1973 World Series teams against each other in a four-inning rematch that took place before the Mets-Phillies game. The Mets defeated the A's, 3-1, with a three-run, third-inning rally.</p>
        <p>Ed Kranepool, the longtime first baseman, went 2 for 2 with a double and drove in two runs to lead the Mets. Felix Millan drove in the other New York run, dropping a bloop single into right that scored Bud Harrelson from second base.</p>
        <p>In addition to Kranepool, Millan and Harrelson, the Mets' roster included Wayne Garrett, Jerry Grote, Don Hahn, Ron Hodges, Cleon Jones, Jon Matlack, Jim McAndrew, Ray Sadecki, Rusty Staub, George Stone and George Theodore. Headliners for the A's were Vida Blue, Bert Campaneris and the Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers.</p>
