        <p>Natalie Cole's new album, "Take a Look," should erase any lingering doubts that the 1991 blockbuster "Unforgettable With Love" was an inspired, one-of-kind stroke of pop nostalgia. Recorded with many of the same arrangers and players, the new album also focuses on jazz and pre-rock pop songs, many of them standards lavishly arranged for orchestra.</p>
        <p>But if the sound of "Take a Look" (Elektra 9 61496; CD and cassette) is similar to that of "Unforgettable," a tribute to her father, Nat (King) Cole, its perspective is broader and quirkier. And it firmly establishes Ms. Cole as a polished pop-jazz stylist of conservative temperament who is a hybrid of her father, Ella Fitzgerald and the young Aretha Franklin.</p>

        <p>Natalie Cole's new album, "Take a Look," should erase any lingering doubts that the 1991 blockbuster "Unforgettable With Love" was an inspired, one-of-kind stroke of pop nostalgia. Recorded with many of the same arrangers and players, the new album also focuses on jazz and pre-rock pop songs, many of them standards lavishly arranged for orchestra.</p>
        <p>But if the sound of "Take a Look" (Elektra 9 61496; CD and cassette) is similar to that of "Unforgettable," a tribute to her father, Nat (King) Cole, its perspective is broader and quirkier. And it firmly establishes Ms. Cole as a polished pop-jazz stylist of conservative temperament who is a hybrid of her father, Ella Fitzgerald and the young Aretha Franklin.</p>
        <p>Sprinkled among chestnuts like "I Wish You Love," "As Time Goes By" and "Cry Me a River" are obscurities like "Calypso Blues," a novelty that her father used to perform in concert, and "It's Sand Man," a cool mid-50's period piece associated with the jazz trio Lambert, Hendricks and Ross. Ms. Cole has also re-recorded "Lovers," a swing-flavored pop-soul number she co-wrote and sang on her 1977 album "Thankful."</p>
        <p>The new album's title song is a devastating lament by Clyde Otis for children scarred by racial strife. Ms. Franklin recorded it in the mid-60's for Columbia Records before moving to Atlantic, where she was christened the queen of soul. Ms. Cole's interpretation is a lot like Ms. Franklin's but more reticent and tagged with an upbeat invocation.</p>
        <p>"Take a Look" is not the only song strongly associated with another female singer. "Crazy He Calls Me" and "Don't Explain" are closely identified with Billie Holiday, for whom they were expressions of a fervent masochistic devotion. The 1958 jazz oddity "Swingin' Shepherd Blues" is associated with Ms. Fitzgerald. "Cry Me a River" was originally sung by Julie London as a breathy, tears-in-your-martini 50's torch song, then redefined by Barbra Streisand as a hysterical revenge fantasy. Ms. Cole's versions of all three are wistful and semidetached.</p>
        <p>Although the new album includes no remakes of her father's biggest hits, echoes of his style suffuse the record. Mr. Cole was one of many singers who recorded the 40's pop standard "Let There Be Love." "Too Close for Comfort" was a number he and Ms. Fitzgerald sang together on television, and he recorded the torchy "This Will Make You Laugh" when he was in his early 20's and still called himself Shorty Nadine.</p>
        <p>Despite the continued familial tie on several songs, "Take a Look" is ultimately a showcase for Ms. Cole's musical identity, as distinct from that of her father. If their stylistic kinship is as pronounced as before, this time Ms. Cole sounds emotionally liberated from the constricting role of worshipful daughter. She takes many more chances, and the uptempo singing has a jazzier flexibility and bounce and at moments even a growling exuberance.</p>
        <p>The biggest similarities between Ms. Cole and her father are in attitude. Instead of working toward catharsis, they aspire to a genteel elegance, balance and good feeling. Lyrics are read generally, without regard for their moment-by-moment inner drama. Sad-hearted ballads become dreamy rather than depressing, and uptempo songs invoke a genial exuberance and playfulness without a hint of anger or rebellion. Cushiony enunciation and silky phrasing help give the most aggressive moments a curvaceous grace.</p>
        <p>But where the ultimate direction of the father's singing was an easy chair on a moonlit porch, his daughter's tenser, more brittle singing evokes an urban, indoor setting. To the decorous phrasing of a big band singer she brings a steady current of soul-music sassiness.</p>
        <p>It has been nearly 18 years since Ms. Cole made her recording debut as soul singer and was hailed as an Aretha Franklin clone and potential rival to the throne. Only recently has she emerged as a mature performer who blends pop, jazz and soul with an ease and fluency that, compared to her somewhat forced imitations of Ms. Franklin, seem practically effortless. As a singer she has accomplished exactly the kind of fusion her father might have achieved had he been a little younger and lived a little longer.</p>
