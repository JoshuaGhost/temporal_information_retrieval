        <p>An on-court flareup between PAM SHRIVER and ZINA GARRISON-JACKSON yesterday overshadowed their quarterfinal match at the Edgbaston tournament in Birmingham, England, which Garrison-Jackson won, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. During the match, played on an indoor court because rain made the grass courts unplayable, Shriver fired the ball at Garrison-Jackson and swore at her opponent's fans.</p>
        <p>"She acted like a bitch," Garrison-Jackson said. "I couldn't believe that she didn't get a warning." Garrison said that she was sure Shriver was "a good person at heart."</p>

        <p>An on-court flareup between PAM SHRIVER and ZINA GARRISON-JACKSON yesterday overshadowed their quarterfinal match at the Edgbaston tournament in Birmingham, England, which Garrison-Jackson won, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2. During the match, played on an indoor court because rain made the grass courts unplayable, Shriver fired the ball at Garrison-Jackson and swore at her opponent's fans.</p>
        <p>"She acted like a bitch," Garrison-Jackson said. "I couldn't believe that she didn't get a warning." Garrison said that she was sure Shriver was "a good person at heart."</p>
        <p>"But I heard some of the things she was saying about me, like calling me stupid," she said. "I would never say things like that about her."</p>
        <p>The 29-year-old from Houston said she considered some of Shriver's actions and comments to be racist.</p>
        <p>"There are a lot of things about me, but I don't have a racist bone in my body," said Shriver, 30. "That hurts a little bit."</p>
        <p>"Anyone who plays long enough has these matches," she said, acknowledging that she would apologize to Garrison-Jackson. "On the court you get stretched physically and mentally and things happen. That's competition."</p>
        <p>Shriver is president of the Women's Tennis Association, and Garrison-Jackson is on the board of directors. "I'm seriously thinking about resigning," Garrison-Jackson said. "She's supposed to be our leader and it's going to be a major conflict for me from now on."</p>
        <p>Said Shriver, "That would be a great loss." (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: TENNIS</p>
