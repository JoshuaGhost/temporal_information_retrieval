        <p>The bullish story on Andrea is that it has a wondrous device that will suppress street noise on pay telephones.

        <p>The bullish story on Andrea is that it has a wondrous device that will suppress street noise on pay telephones. It hasn't sold any systems yet, and the GTE Corporation, for one, says it is happy with alternative systems and has not talked to Andrea. But Bellcore, the research arm of the regional Bell companies, is looking at the system.</p>
        <p>At its peak last week, Andrea had a market value, assuming exercise of management options, of $186 million. That's not bad for a company that last year reported a loss of $691,000 on revenues of $3.4 million. The stock dipped after Andrea said the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked questions about the trading. Even now, the total market value is $117 million, and the shares are $34 -- still far above the $1.50 the stock was fetching last fall.</p>
