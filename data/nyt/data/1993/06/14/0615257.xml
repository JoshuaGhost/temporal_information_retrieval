        <p>Kevin Johnson was tired before the game. He was tired of being identified as the principal flop of the first two playoff games in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>Johnson was tired after the game, too. He was exhausted from playing 62 minutes, the most ever played in a National Basketball Association final-round game. But he felt much better than he might have because the Suns defeated the home team, 129-121, in the triple-overtime marathon dance that more or less brought the Suns back into this series.</p>
        <p>"Fatigue was not a factor, even in overtime," said Tom Chambers of the Suns. "We were going to give it everything we had, no matter what. We weren't spent as a team."</p>
        <p>That was a very different vision than Phil Jackson's. The Bulls' coach said he felt "our energy slipping away" after two overtimes. And he was right. A 20-Second Break</p>
        <p>Johnson had the most reason to be tired because he played three more minutes than Dan Majerle and four more than B. J. Armstrong. Michael Jordan's right arm must be tired after 57 minutes and 43 shots. But Johnson got the record -- one official minute less than the maximum of 63 in the game, but actually he played more than that.</p>
        <p>"I did give him a break -- for the last 20 seconds," said Coach Paul Westphal. "I told Kevin to tell me when he was tired. He forgot to tell me."</p>
        <p>The finals record was 61 minutes, set by Garfield Heard of Phoenix at Boston on June 4, 1976. Heard deserves a permanent place in the record books for playing 61 minutes in June in Uncle Red's Steambath, where the Celtics' management pumps hot air into the sauna-sized visiting clubhouse. The hot-air warfare helped the Celtics win that day, over a certain guard named Westphal. But Westphal said he liked this game better.</p>
        <p>"I think it will go down as one of the outstanding and exciting games in history, along with the other three-overtime game in which I was a participant," Westphal said. "This time, the good guys won."</p>
        <p>Also, the problem in Chicago is not heat but noise. Sixty-three minutes with the inane blare of all the Bulls' promotions qualifies everybody for the record book -- or maybe damages. An Untimely Gaffe</p>
        <p>And just because you haven't read some of these names in a long time, Johnson's 62 minutes fell short of the overtime playoff record of 67, set by Ephraim (Red) Rocha and Paul Seymour of the Syracuse Nationals in March 1953.</p>
        <p>Johnson's long evening included one major gaffe that nearly cost a victory. With the game tied at 103 in regulation, Johnson stole the ball and pushed it upcourt, with Westphal yelling, "Go! Go! Go!" But Johnson called timeout, and Referee Dick Bavetta acknowledged it, before Majerle slammed home a dunk. "That was interesting," Westphal said.</p>
        <p>Nobody was more relieved at the victory than Johnson, who had taken a lot of the blame as the Suns more than squandered their home-court advantage.</p>
        <p>"I don't deny it, I read the papers," Johnson said. "I read where my dream was turning into a nightmare. I heard people applauding when we got to the hotel here, but then I realized it was because we lost two to the Bulls."</p>
        <p>Johnson also spent most of the game guarding, or trying to guard, Jordan. Asked how that came about, Johnson said: "Don't get me in trouble; I didn't ask to guard Jordan. I just felt my game would improve if I tried it."</p>
        <p>Asked how low he had felt after the first two games, Johnson said: "I don't know how low I was, but the seat was kind of hot. Tonight, I really felt good about our chances in the third overtime after we came back from being down 4 with 40 seconds left in the second."</p>
        <p>But was he tired? "I was pretty exhausted, but it feels good when you win it."  PRO BASKETBALL</p>
