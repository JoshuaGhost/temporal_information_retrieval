        <p>With significant bipartisan support, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee approved legislation today to make it a Federal crime to blockade or damage abortion clinics or to threaten or harm abortion providers.</p>
        <p>Three of the committee's seven Republicans joined the 10 Democrats on the panel in voting for the bill. The four Republicans who opposed it argued that it was unbalanced because it would not protect anti-abortion demonstrators from attacks that threatened their right to free speech.</p>

        <p>With significant bipartisan support, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee approved legislation today to make it a Federal crime to blockade or damage abortion clinics or to threaten or harm abortion providers.</p>
        <p>Three of the committee's seven Republicans joined the 10 Democrats on the panel in voting for the bill. The four Republicans who opposed it argued that it was unbalanced because it would not protect anti-abortion demonstrators from attacks that threatened their right to free speech.</p>
        <p>Although the bill would protect centers that counsel against abortion as well as those that provide it, it is aimed at militant anti-abortion groups like Operation Rescue, whose strategy has been to block patients from entering abortion clinics. Full Senate Is Next</p>
        <p>The bill will be ready for Senate action shortly. Operation Rescue plans protests in seven cities this summer, so the bill's sponsors may try to take advantage of any reaction to those activities by having the bill brought up for consideration at such a time.</p>
        <p>The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote within the next few weeks to send similar legislation to the House floor.</p>
        <p>The Senate measure has broad support, including the backing of longtime abortion opponents like Senators Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota, and Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona. It may be the best legislative opportunity this year for abortion-rights advocates in Congress.</p>
        <p>Other abortion-rights tests face cloudier futures. On Thursday, for example, the House Appropriations Committee will vote on whether to repeal the ban on Federal financing of abortions for poor women served by Medicaid.</p>
        <p>The outcome is uncertain, but regardless of how that vote comes out, the issue is likely to be fought over every step of the way, in committee and on the floor in both houses.</p>
        <p>The only real debate today was over extending the anti-blockade bill to protect peaceful protests against abortion. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, voted against the bill but insisted that he supported its protections against anti-abortion violence. Free Speech Argument</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatch said he condemned the killing of Dr. David Gunn, an abortion provider who was slain during an anti-abortion rally in Pensacola, Fla., in March, "and other acts of violence against abortion clinics and those providing abortion services."</p>
        <p>"Violence is no answer to the violence of abortion itself," he said.</p>
        <p>But "the First Amendment rights of protesters must also receive protection," Mr. Hatch argued. "If violence connected with abortion is to end, both sides must be treated equally, and the legal rights of all must be protected."</p>
        <p>Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the Democrat who heads the committee, insisted that peaceful protests were already protected and that there was no demonstrable need for the Federal Government to become involved in regulating protests all over the country.</p>
        <p>"This is not about free speech," he said. "This is about violence and intimidation and threats."</p>
        <p>Senator Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, read a letter from Attorney General Janet Reno in which she supported the bill. Ms. Reno said that the problems covered by the bill were national in scope and that they typically "overwhelmed the ability of local law enforcement to respond."</p>
        <p>The bill would make it a Federal crime to use force, the threat of force or physical obstruction to intimidate people from obtaining or providing "abortion-related services" and would also make it a Federal offense to damage or destroy a medical center because it provided such services.</p>
        <p>The bill defines "abortion-related services" to include providing abortions or providing counseling against abortions.</p>
