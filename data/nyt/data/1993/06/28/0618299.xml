        <p>Showing pictures of bomb components, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations presented detailed evidence today to support the Clinton Administration's case that it was legally justified in carrying out a missile attack on an Iraqi intelligence site in Baghdad.</p>
        <p>The delegate, Madeleine K. Albright,said United States retaliation was consistent with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which provides for the right of self-defense, for what American officials have concluded was a plot by the Iraqi Government to assassinate former President George Bush in Kuwait.</p>

        <p>Showing pictures of bomb components, the chief United States delegate to the United Nations presented detailed evidence today to support the Clinton Administration's case that it was legally justified in carrying out a missile attack on an Iraqi intelligence site in Baghdad.</p>
        <p>The delegate, Madeleine K. Albright,said United States retaliation was consistent with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which provides for the right of self-defense, for what American officials have concluded was a plot by the Iraqi Government to assassinate former President George Bush in Kuwait.</p>
        <p>Article 51 says, in part, "Nothing in the present Charter shall impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member of the United Nations." Photos of Bombs</p>
        <p>In her presentation, Ms. Albright displayed large photographs of the bombs and integrated circuits that American officials said were to be used in the plot against Mr. Bush in April.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a special session of the Security Council this afternoon, she said, "From all the evidence available to our intelligence community, we are highly confident that the Iraqi Government, at its highest levels, directed its intelligence services to carry out an assassination attempt against President Bush."</p>
        <p>She continued, "In our judgment, every member here today would regard an assassination attempt against its former head of state as an attack against itself and would react." 'Act of Blackmail'</p>
        <p>In response, the Iraqi delegate, Nizar Hamdoon, called the American attack "an unprecedented act of blackmail." He accused Kuwait of "totally fabricating" the evidence against Iraq, saying it was similar to the "infamous stories" that circulated about Iraqi soldiers taking babies from incubators during their occupation of Kuwait in 1991.</p>
        <p>"Certain organs in the American Government found pretexts in that in order to commit further acts of aggression against Iraq," Mr. Hamdoon said.</p>
        <p>Washington's turn to the Security Council seemed in large measure a public-relations gesture aimed at winning international support for its attack against Iraq.</p>
        <p>The United States delegation, which requested an unusual Sunday meeting of the Council, did not ask for a formal statement or resolution approving its actions. One American official explained the move as "the most efficient way of letting the world know our reasons for doing what we did."</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, Ms. Albright conducted telephone conversations with representatives of the other four permanent members of the Security Council: France, Britain, Russia and China. Warning Against Response</p>
        <p>She had also met with Mr. Hamdoon and, one official said, told the Iraqi delegate that the United States regarded the attempted assassination as a direct attack on the United States that warranted a direct response. Ms. Albright also warned Mr. Hamdoon that any Iraqi retaliation "would be met with a direct and overwhelming response," the official said.</p>
        <p>In her speech to the Council today, Ms. Albright summarized a two-month investigation of the Iraqi assassination attempt against Mr. Bush. She said that American intelligence agents had interviewed the men who are awaiting trial in Kuwait in the plot and that they had conducted forensic tests on the car bomb and the explosive devices that were to be used.</p>
        <p>Summarizing the Iraqi plot, she said a Toyota Land Cruiser, packed with an advanced 70-pound explosive capable of blowing up a four-square-block area, was smuggled across the Kuwait-Iraq border on April 13.</p>
        <p>"Key components," she said, including "the remote-controlled firing device, the plastic explosives, the blasting cap, the integrated circuitry and the wiring, were built by the same person or persons who built bombs previously recovered from the Iraqis.</p>
        <p>"Certain aspects of these devices," she added, "have been found only in devices linked to Iraq and not in devices used by any other terrorist group."</p>
