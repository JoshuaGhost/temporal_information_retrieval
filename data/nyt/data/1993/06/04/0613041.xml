        <p>"The Music of Chance" was shown as part of the recent New Directors/ New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 19, 1993. The film opens today at the Fine Arts, 4 West 58th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A miniature city is the haunting centerpiece of "The Music of Chance," Philip Haas's cool, methodical film version of Paul Auster's equally meticulous 1990 novel. Called City of the World, it is the bizarre play thing of Willie Stone (Joel Grey), a former optometrist who made his fortune by winning the lottery. Together with his friend Bill Flower (Charles Durning), Stone lives in an isolated mansion and contemplates the meaning of fate while playing childlike games. The City of the World is his masterwork. James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) and Jack Pozzi (James Spader) are his victims.</p>

        <p>"The Music of Chance" was shown as part of the recent New Directors/ New Films series at the Museum of Modern Art. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 19, 1993. The film opens today at the Fine Arts, 4 West 58th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>A miniature city is the haunting centerpiece of "The Music of Chance," Philip Haas's cool, methodical film version of Paul Auster's equally meticulous 1990 novel. Called City of the World, it is the bizarre play thing of Willie Stone (Joel Grey), a former optometrist who made his fortune by winning the lottery. Together with his friend Bill Flower (Charles Durning), Stone lives in an isolated mansion and contemplates the meaning of fate while playing childlike games. The City of the World is his masterwork. James Nashe (Mandy Patinkin) and Jack Pozzi (James Spader) are his victims.</p>
        <p>With the tenor of a Beckett play as filtered through the mathematical mind of Peter Greenaway, Mr. Haas's cryptic, elegantly made "Music of Chance" traces the trajectory of Nashe and Pozzi. Starting out as drifters, they are brought together accidentally and wind up as slaves to Flower and Stone's peculiar vision. Pozzi is a desperate gambler, and Nashe is in the last stages of an existential experiment (of the sort that has made Mr. Auster's work much more widely appreciated in Europe than it is here, where this New Jersey-born novelist remains something of a cult figure). Trapped together on the Flower and Stone estate, they find release in the bleak comforts of a shared destiny.</p>
        <p>Mr. Auster's story, which the film follows as faithfully as possible, has the latitude to look deeply into such mysteries. His book first finds Nashe at the end of a yearlong driving spree, and it has the wherewithal to explain how Nashe's life led him to this juncture. Separated from his wife and child, newly flush thanks to an inheritance from a father he barely knew, this former fireman has severed all ties to his past, bought a new car and simply begun driving.</p>
        <p>Nashe is nearly out of money when he happens to spot Pozzi, badly beaten, by the side of a road. "It was one of those random, accidental encounters that seem to materialize out of thin air; a twig breaks off in the wind and suddenly lands at your feet," Mr. Auster writes of that meeting. The film, which can show only a car, a road and two drifters making conversation, is already at a disadvantage. Even allowing for the essentially opaque nature of this material, this terse, oddly mesmerizing film often suffers from an inability to provide more than the bare bones of Mr. Auster's story.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haas makes up for that by accentuating the material's most peculiar aspects with supreme, piquant clarity. "The Music of Chance" is filled with curious, resonant parallels. When Nashe and Pozzi (whose name suggests a parallel with the Pozzo of "Waiting for Godot") arrive at the mansion for an all-important poker game, they come with $10,000, the last of Nashe's money. They lose it all, and are instead given 10,000 stones: they are forced to agree to build a monument made from these identical blocks, imported from Ireland by Flowers and left over from a castle destroyed by Oliver Cromwell. To emphasize the infantilizing aspect of this task, they are given a child's little red wagon for carrying blocks. And as they work on the project to Stone's exacting specifications, their progress is incorporated into his model city.</p>
        <p>Mr. Auster's writing is filled by such gamesmanship, and is saved from preciousness by the leanness and simplicity of the author's style. Mr. Haas, a well-respected documentary film maker making his feature debut, has these same virtues. His film has a sustaining air of mystery and a quiet, rarefied beauty that saves it from seeming too myopic or coy. Superbly photographed by Bernard Zitzermann and greatly aided by Phillip Johnston's score (which is augmented by Beethoven and Berlioz), "The Music of Chance" is as inviting as it is puzzling. Only in its final scene (which features Mr. Auster in a tiny role) does the film lose its nerve.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patinkin, looking lean and tough (the credits mention his "strength and conditioning consultant"), gives an effectively terse performance. Mr. Spader is more of a wild card, and a greater source of leavening humor. With his hair dyed black and greasy, a small spot of beard beneath his lower lip, he exudes Pozzi's sleaziness and also captures the character's outlandish charm. Also in the cast, and especially good, is M. Emmet Walsh as the estate's countrified, faintly dangerous overseer. Mr. Walsh's sly performance perfectly captures the novel's description of Calvin Murks, the character he plays: "There was something so deeply imperturbable about the man, so fundamentally oblique and humorless, that Nashe could never decide if he was inwardly laughing at them or just plain dumb."</p>
