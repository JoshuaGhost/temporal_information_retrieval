        <p>Qedusizi Maphalala is South African.</p>
        <p>Mary Ruby Lee Thomas Johnson is American.</p>
        <p>They do not know each other. Thousands of miles of land and sea separate them. But on the stage of the Carey Playhouse at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, these two black women are united by history: sisters related if not by blood, then by bloodshed. The forces of bigotry and oppression in their native lands bind them. But bitter as their lives may be, hope and song salve their spirits.</p>
        <p>Qedusizi Maphalala (Mary Twala) and Mary Ruby Lee Thomas Johnson (Ebony Jo-Ann, who helped develop and write her role) are the principal characters in "Sheila's Day." The production, written by Duma Ndlovu and directed by Mbongeni Ngema for a company of four South African and eight American black women, runs through tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Pervaded by sadness, brightened by humor, occasionally etched by mime and at its exuberant best when it breaks into dance and song -- Zulu chants, gospel, blues -- "Sheila's Day" is an 80-minute intermissionless immersion in two seemingly ordinary lives swept up in the surging, brutal tides of racial history.</p>
        <p>Qedusizi Maphalala, arriving in Johannesburg from Zululand to seek work, finds herself caught in a protest by 20,000 women against the passbooks that blacks must carry. She finds not work, but South African justice: six months in prison, digging potatoes with her bare hands, being sexually used by a guard. Released, she finds work as a Sheila, the name domestics are known by because their white employers cannot be bothered to learn their real ones. ("Sheila's day" is the term applied to the maid's day off.) After long and faithful service, she asks her employer to help her get a legal work permit, but is summarily fired when her prison past is revealed. Back among her people, she is trapped in the Sharpeville massacre, where a child is blown to bits before her eyes and her cousin is shot to death.</p>
        <p>As for Mary Ruby Lee Thomas Johnson, she is definitely the handmaiden of history, even if an inadvertent one. On a bus in Montgomery, Ala., on her way home from her first job as a domestic, she is witness to a dispute between the driver and a black woman who refuses to move to the back. The next day, Ruby Lee is fired for arriving late to work because of the bus boycott touched off by the black woman, who is Rosa Parks.</p>
        <p>When Ruby Lee is hired as a dishwasher in Woolworth's, it is, of course, the one where the lunch-counter sit-ins began in 1958. Once again, she loses her job. In 1961 she leaves her position as a maid to take a bus home to Marion, Ala., to visit her ailing mother. The bus from Montgomery, carrying freedom riders, is firebombed by bigots. Back in Marion, she is in the company of a childhood friend when he is killed by whites in their fury at a voter-registration drive.</p>
        <p>While Mary Twala and Ebony Jo-Ann play the focal roles in "Sheila's Day," the other women in the cast light up the proceedings by joining them in song and dance and by appearing in deft, brief supporting roles, including those of a jailer, a South African woman laying down the laws of the household and a menacing redneck.</p>
        <p>As theater, "Sheila's Day" is polished ensemble work; as history, it is a compelling reminder of the sisterhood that struggles and yearns for brotherhood. Sheila's Day</p>
