        <p>When President Clinton announced that David R. Gergen would be brought into the White House as a new and important adviser, all the signs of a classic Washington power play were evident. Except one. Mr. Gergen has no office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gergen, who has worked at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue before and knows well the value of its internal real estate, has been temporarily relegated to a basement office with one assistant that he brought with him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gergen has been assured that more appropriate quarters will soon be carved out in the increasingly crowded row of suites hard by the Oval Office. After all, as counselor to the President, he holds a conspicuously high and mighty office.</p>
        <p>But until the move, everyone is thinking hard about how to fit him in -- without losing the space they have established for themselves and bruising their own egos.</p>
        <p>The shuffle so far:</p>
        <p>George Stephanopoulos, who used to be communications director and is now a senior adviser, turned over the keys to his large office to Mark D. Gearan, the deputy chief of staff who inherited Mr. Stephanopoulos's job. Mr. Gearan's old digs have been deeded to Roy Neel, another deputy chief of staff who had been homeless since he moved over from Vice President Al Gore's office, where he was chief of staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stephanopoulos sacrificed space for proximity. He and his assistant, Heather Beckel, have moved into offices with a door that adjoins the President's dining room -- placing them so close to the Oval Office that they have to turn on a special alarm at night. To make room, Nancy Hernreich, the President's deputy assistant for appointments was shunted over to the other side of the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>But that space had been occupied by Andrew Friendly, Mr. Clinton's personal aide. Mr. Friendly was moved to . . . well, you get the drift.</p>
        <p>All this anxiety about office space may seem a bit perplexing to most people. But the plain truth is that outside of Manhattan there are few places where location has more value than at the White House.</p>
        <p>In the Clinton White House, the rules are more complicated than usual, since there are two power centers in the West Wing offices, one near the Oval Office and the other near the second-floor office where Hillary Rodham Clinton has established a base roughly atop her husband's study.</p>
        <p>But the basic formula still applies: the closer to the Oval Office, the better. Nonetheless it seems a lot of fuss about very little. No one admits it, but the West Wing is actually quite cluttered and small. Everyone is within yards of the Oval Office, and the argument is about a few feet, or even a few inches.</p>
        <p>White House officials like to say that they treat office space as a matter of convenience, not of power.</p>
        <p>But Marlin Fitzwater, who was George Bush's press secretary, said the real truth was somewhat more subtle.</p>
        <p>"If you're a strong player on the President's team, it doesn't matter where you are," Mr. Fitzwater said. "You can be that from every place. But if you're a weak player and you're not on the first floor, you're nothing."</p>
        <p>History shows that anytime someone is moved, there is trouble. When John H. Sununu's stock fell, he was banished to the Old Executive Office building that houses hundreds of White House staff members who did not make the West Wing cut. The offices are more spacious and ornate there but unnervingly distant from the locus of power.</p>
        <p>Musical chairs in the West Wing can get a little crazy, as it did over the weekend. Thomas F. McLarty 3d, the chief of staff, briefly considered, then rejected, turning the President's dining room into work space. A downstairs barber shop has already been turned into another office, though Mr. Clinton could have saved himself a lot of trouble by keeping it open.</p>
        <p>And things stand to get crazier as Mr. McLarty completes a reorganization plan that is expected to include the addition of yet another officeless officeholder, a deputy chief of staff to replace Mr. Gearan.</p>
        <p>White House staff members have taken to talking about installing loft space for the newcomers.</p>
        <p>Then, anxiously, they rush to insist that they are only joking.</p>
