        <p>Behind a gritty two-hitter by Mike Soto, Monsignor McClancy High School of East Elmhurst, Queens, made its third straight trip to Yankee Stadium a rousing success yesterday, winning its second Catholic High Schools Athletic Association championship in three years. The score was 3-0 and the loser was St. Joseph by the Sea, a Staten Island school playing its first title game.</p>
        <p>Soto, a senior left-hander, walked none, struck out eight and stayed cool despite three errors and a passed ball by his teammates, raising his season mark to 9-0. The victory gave McClancy a 21-4 record and dropped St. Joseph by the Sea, a former all-girls school, to 17-12. In his first year at McClancy, Soto was a member of the city championship freshman team. As a sophomore, he was on the varsity when McClancy beat Brooklyn's Xavierian at Yankee Stadium. As a junior last year, he watched the Crusaders lose the title game to Fordham Prep.</p>

        <p>A walk to Alex Savino, a long triple to right-center by Tom Fieger, and a two-out, two-run double to left by Carlos Arce provided all the scoring in the McClancy fifth. The rest was up to Soto, who twice pitched out of jams.</p>
