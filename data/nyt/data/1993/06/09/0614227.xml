        <p>Like a staggered prizefighter, the stock market came off the floor a number of times yesterday, trying to rally but still closing lower for lack of buyers.</p>
        <p>Many of the stocks that declined on Monday, like technology and gaming issues, continued their losses, but others, like banks, found support among investors looking for bargains.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average lost 21.59 points, to 3,510.54. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was 240.6 million shares, slightly higher than Monday but still off the pace of recent weeks. Widespread Weakness</p>
        <p>Weakness was widespread. The New York Stock Exchange composite index was down 1.65 points, to 245.15, as losing issues outnumbered gainers by a ratio of slightly more than 2 to 1. The American Stock Exchange index lost 3.72 points, to 437.18; the Nasdaq composite dropped 6.87 points, to 687.74, and the Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.98 points, to 444.71.</p>
        <p>Dennis E. Jarrett, chief market analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Company sees the market in a defensive posture. "A couple of large sell programs really accentuated the feeling in the market yesterday," Mr. Jarrett said.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead to the release Friday of inflation numbers for May, he said: "We, the market, tend to anticipate the worst, and as humans discount the event by making strategic shifts in and out of portfolios. But when it happens, it's usually not as bad as we first imagine it to be."</p>
        <p>A weak bond market also worked against stocks yesterday, as the 30-year Treasury bond fell in price, as did other maturities.</p>
        <p>Gaming stocks, which had been on fire lately, showed signs of weakening yesterday as traders began to suspect that they were overpriced.</p>
        <p>Oil stocks attracted attention amid meetings of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva this week and negotiations between the Administration and Senate leaders over President Clinton's energy tax proposal.</p>
        <p>Apple Computer, down 7.5 percent on Monday over concerns that earnings would fall below analysts' estimates, lost 1 1/4, to 49 1/2, as several analysts dropped their ratings and earnings estimates. BankAmerica Shares Slip</p>
        <p>BankAmerica, the most actively traded issue on the Big Board yesterday, also fell victim to ratings and earnings estimate changes by analysts, losing 3/4, to 41 1/4. Traders said Prudential Securities lowered the rating and earnings estimates on Monday because of the drag California's economy was having on BankAmerica's results.</p>
        <p>Shares in Deluxe fell 6, to 39 5/8, after the check printing company said it would close 16 of its 60 printing plants and cut 8.5 percent of the division's 10,300 employees and take a restructuring charge for the quarter.</p>
