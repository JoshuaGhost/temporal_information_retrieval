        <p>When the wheelchair-bound student, James B.

But his application was rejected by 10 medical schools; he said they told him they could not accommodate a quadriplegic student.</p>
        <p>In January, Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania signed a measure, nicknamed the Jimmy Post Bill, barring such discrimination. But this year Mr. Post was again rejected by 15 schools. The acceptance from Einstein arrived last week.</p>
        <p>"I got what I wanted," he said in an interview. "I didn't have to sue a school to get in."</p>
