        <p>Bernie Williams isn't used to making curtain calls. They don't do them in the minor leagues. He was reluctant to come out of the dugout and tip his cap Monday night after his grand slam lifted the Yankees over the Red Sox, 4-0.</p>
        <p>He could have taken several curtain calls last night after his eighth-inning home run gave the Yankees a 9-7 lead.</p>
        <p>"I didn't know I had to go out," the 24-year-old center fielder said. "It's two days in a row now."</p>
        <p>"Bernie might have been the difference tonight, along with our bullpen," Manager Buck Showalter said after the victory. "The home run he gave us was momentum, and it gave us some added cushion."</p>
        <p>Williams went 4 for 5: a single in the first inning, a single in the fifth, a triple in the sixth and his solo home. And he has been off the disabled list just eight days after recovering from a muscle strain in his lower rib cage.</p>
        <p>He also contributed defensively when Boston's Ernest Riles belted a long drive to left-center in the fourth inning. Williams, playing shallow, raced back and made a running catch.</p>
        <p>"I take a lot of pride in my defense," Williams said.</p>
