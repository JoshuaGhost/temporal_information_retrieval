        <p>A United States envoy left today on a mission to Vietnam, but President Clinton instructed him that new questions about American prisoners of war must be resolved before there can be any thaw in relations with Hanoi.</p>
        <p>The questions were raised by a 1972 report that suggests that Hanoi held more American prisoners than it has acknowledged. In turn, however, questions have also been raised about the document itself. The researcher who discovered it in the archives of the Soviet Communist Party in Moscow has also come under criticism as a partisan who ardently opposes normalizing relations with Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Some historians and researchers involved in the issue of American prisoners in Southeast Asia say the document contains inaccuracies that call its validity into question. Some call the document an outright fabrication, echoing terms that the Hanoi Government has used to describe it.</p>
        <p>"It's a clumsy fabrication," said H. Bruce Franklin, a professor of English and American Studies at Rutgers University who has written a book in which he asserts that the Vietnamese do not still hold American prisoners of war. "There is just about no fact in the document that correlates with the historical reality." 'Fullest Possible Accounting'</p>
        <p>The White House envoy, John W. Vessey Jr., a retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who served in Vietnam as a major in the field artillery, has been negotiating with Hanoi for information on the fate of the 2,260 Americans still listed as missing in action.</p>
        <p>He will now check into the validity of the 1972 report, which suggests that Hanoi was holding 1,205 American prisoners in 1972, when it said it only held 368. The Vietnamese released 591 Americans as part of Operation Homecoming in early 1973, and since then they have consistently said they did not hold any more.</p>
        <p>"The President stressed that he wanted the fullest possible accounting and said that only when we have that can we even consider any changes in our policy toward Vietnam," George Stephanopoulos, the White House spokesman, said today.</p>
        <p>Vietnamese officials are hoping that the U.S. will ease its trade embargo, or, more important, not try to block new loans from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
        <p>The report, a Russian translation of a Vietnamese document, was unearthed by Stephen J. Morris, a fellow at Harvard University's Russian Research Center. Mr. Morris, an Australian who came to the United States to study in 1976, is not on the faculty but uses the center for research supported by grants.</p>
        <p>His research in the Russian archives was sponsored by the Cold War History Project, at the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington. Officials of the project said Mr. Morris is to be paid for producing a report on his work. Some Experts Believe Report</p>
        <p>Several Soviet experts, including a former national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski, have said they believe the report is genuine.</p>
        <p>But skeptics, including Dr. Franklin, cite inaccuracies. For example, he and other experts cited a reference to the dispersal of American P.O.W.'s from 4 prisons to 11 after the abortive American raid on the Son Tay prison, 20 miles northwest of Hanoi, in September 1970. Each of the 11 prisons held about 100 prisoners, the report said. But the critics say that after the Son Tay raid, the Vietnamese consolidated -- rather than dispersed -- American prisoners to keep a closer eye on them.</p>
        <p>In addition, Kenneth L. Coskey, executive director of the Naval Historical Foundation and a former inmate at the Hoa Lo Prison -- the infamous "Hanoi Hilton" -- said at least 350 prisoners were held there. Mr. Coskey did not offer an opinion on the document's authenticity.</p>
        <p>"The idea they had 100 in Hoa Lo is inaccurate," said a Congressional investigator who has worked on the M.I.A. issue and who insisted on anonymity.  Defining a Prison</p>
        <p>Reached in Boston, Mr. Morris said the apparent discrepancy may relate to how the Vietnamese defined a prison. "There may have been separate compounds in Hoa Lo," Mr. Morris said. "I don't know how they're defining it. There might be subdivisons."</p>
        <p>The Vietnamese have said the main evidence to refute the document was that Gen. Tran Van Quang, the report's original author, was not Deputy to the North Vietnamese Army General Staff in 1972, as the Russian version indicates. But United States intelligence officials said today that he did hold that position.</p>
        <p>One explanation offered by a former intelligence analyst to account for the large number of Americans listed by the Vietnamese as prisoners was that the Vietnamese may have included several hundred captured Asian civilians who were working for the Americans.</p>
        <p>Sedgewick Tourison, who worked as an investigator for the Senate Select Committee on P.O.W./M.I.A. Affairs, said between 350 and 500 Asians, mainly Vietnamese, who were used on intelligence-gathering and sabatoge missions in North Vietnam between 1960 and 1968, had been captured.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tourison and another former Congressional investigator say the commandos were often referred to in terms that could confuse their identity. "The commandos were referred to by Radio Hanoi in domestic broadcasts during the war as American spy commandos or American spy saboteurs," Mr. Tourison said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Morris said it was "preposterous" to think that the Russian translation of the document might have misidentified American prisoners.</p>
        <p>"Anybody who has read Communist documents knows that they don't refer to South Vietnamese as American forces," he said. "They always call them puppet forces. Anyone who says that is just not familiar with Communist documents."</p>
