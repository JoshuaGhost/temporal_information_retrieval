        <p>At the core of President Clinton's health-care plan is a radical new concept: a standard package of health benefits that would be guaranteed to all Americans and perhaps be more generous than the health insurance most have now.</p>
        <p>The idea of a uniform benefit package appears to have immense appeal. It could improve health care for many people,, including the 37 million who now have no health insurance, and it could help reduce administrative costs by standardizing policies.</p>
        <p>But this idea, which sounds so simple, could prove politically explosive.</p>
        <p>By defining the minimum benefits, the Federal Government would make decisions that are now left to state laws or to negotiations among insurers, employers and employees.</p>
        <p>Congress will almost surely want to play a large role in determining what benefits are offered, raising the possibility of debate so intense that it could disrupt the entire effort to overhaul the nation's health-care system.</p>
        <p>For example, some women's groups are demanding coverage of reproductive health services, including abortion.  Dozens of other interest groups are lining up to make sure that their special concerns are well treated, too. The political horse-trading could drive costs to intolerable heights.</p>
        <p>Elderly people are insisting on coverage of long-term care. Psychiatrists, marriage counselors, dentists, chiropractors, surgeons and other specialists are pleading for coverage of their services. Undeterred By Pressures</p>
        <p>At the state level, where such debates now occur, similar pressures have led to a proliferation of insurance laws requiring coverage of particular services. Insurers say those mandates have pushed up costs.</p>
        <p>Despite these concerns, Clinton Administration officials are contemplating a package of benefits more comprehensive that what is now available through Medicare or most private health insurance plans.</p>
        <p>Confidential work papers from the President's Task Force on National Health Care Reform show that the panel is drafting detailed requirements for coverage of items like vaccines, routine preventive care for babies, Pap smears, mammograms, physical examinations, prescription drugs, mental health services and drug-abuse treatment.</p>
        <p>The contents of the benefit package will directly affect not only the costs, but also the plan's political acceptability. Benefits must be generous enough to attract broad support, to protect public health and to eliminate the temptation for people to buy private insurance to supplement the standard coverage. But if the package is too comprehensive, it will probably be too costly for the Government and for many employers.</p>
        <p>"The problem is trying to determine what is superfluous, not what is necessary," said Representative Fred Grandy, an Iowa Republican who is a member of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. At a recent subcommittee hearing, Mr. Grandy repeatedly asked, "What should not be in the core benefits package?" He rarely got an answer. Standard Benefits Are a Central Idea</p>
        <p>The idea of a standard benefit package is central to the health policy favored by Mr. Clinton. Under that policy, known as managed competition, large groups of consumers and businesses would buy the standard package of benefits from health maintenance organizations and other networks of doctors and hospitals. The networks are supposed to compete by offering high-quality care at low prices.</p>
        <p>Presumably, most of the networks would be H.M.O.'s and similar prepaid group plans. But Administration officials say there would be provisions allowing people to obtain their health care on a "fee for service" basis as most people do now.</p>
        <p>At present, it is difficult for consumers to shop for health insurance.  "When each health plan is allowed to vary its benefits, consumers cannot easily make price comparisons," said Linda A. Bergthold, an expert on employee benefits, now working for the task force. Ms. Bergthold, an executive at the consulting firm William M. Mercer Inc., analyzed "benefit design choices" in a recent issue of the journal Health Affairs.</p>
        <p>The Government could encourage reliance on the standard benefits through tax law. While employers can now take tax deductions for the cost of providing employee health benefits, some versions of managed competition call for limiting such deductions to the value of the standard package of benefits.</p>
        <p>People would be free to buy more coverage with their own money, but Administration officials say they hope the package will be so attractive that most people accept it as adequate.</p>
        <p>In the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton suggested that a new agency, the National Health Board, would design the benefit package. But members of Congress said they would never leave such an important decision to an administrative agency.</p>
        <p>White House officials got the message. They now say the benefits must be specified in law by Congress. "It would be difficult to ask the American people to accept a pig in a poke," said Ira C. Magaziner, coordinator of the task force. How a Plan Might Work</p>
        <p>Under the plan now being developed, patients would have to pay a certain amount for each medical service, depending on who provided it. The charges would be lower for people enrolled in health maintenance organizations. For example, a person in an H.M.O. might have to pay $10 for a visit to a doctor's office, while other patients would have to pay as much as 40 percent of the doctor's charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Magaziner said President Clinton's plan would propose "a comprehensive package of benefits toward the top end of the range" of the plans that are now available. Another official said, "It will be at the 80th or 90th percentile of generosity," meaning that it will be more generous than all but 10 percent or 20 percent of the policies now sold.</p>
        <p>But that vision of an ideal health plan may collide with fiscal reality. While the Administration has made great progress in defining the benefits that ought to be guaranteed to all Americans, it has only begun to compute the cost.</p>
        <p>Frank B. McArdle, manager of the Washington research office of Hewitt Associates, an employee benefits consulting firm, notes that controlling health costs is supposed to be a major goal of Mr. Clinton's plan. "Whom does it help if you require employers to provide a package of benefits so generous that people are laid off as a result?" Mr. McArdle asks.</p>
        <p>Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said: "There are a lot of good benefits that people would like, but they increase the cost -- mental health services, prescription drugs, long-term care, home health care. There should be options. Small employers just won't be able to afford what big employers have been providing for a long time."</p>
        <p>But the Administration says the standard benefit package must be comprehensive, or else millions of people will buy private insurance to supplement the basic coverage, and the inequities of the current health-care system will continue.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Administration officials say if the standard coverage is comprehensive, the Government will be better able to control the costs of services. The Government will have far less control over services that people buy with their own money. Benefits Now: A Dizzying Array</p>
        <p>A standard package of benefits would be a major change. American employers now provide health benefits to 140 million people, but "there is no standard health benefit package," said Mr. McArdle of Hewitt Associates. "Employees get a lot of choice among plans and among health-care providers," he said. "They value and appreciate that choice."</p>
        <p>The average medium-sized to large employer offers workers a choice of at least one conventional insurance plan and one health maintenance organization, which provides a wide range of services in return for a fixed monthly payment. Data compiled by Hewitt Associates show that when given such a choice, 25 percent of employees typically join the H.M.O.</p>
        <p>Benefit levels vary from industry to industry. If the Government defines a standard package, "it may not increase costs much for industries like aerospace and utilities, which already provide comprehensive benefits," Mr. McArdle said. But such a requirement could sharply increase costs for retail stores and other industries that now provide limited benefits, he said.</p>
        <p>Likewise, Mr. McArdle said, "the same Federal mandate could be an insignificant new cost in the Northeast, where there is relatively generous coverage, but a large economic shock in Texas and the Southwest, where certain benefits like mental health are more limited." Likely Components Of Basic Package</p>
        <p>The plan now envisioned by Administration officials would probably require employers and insurers to cover hospital services without limits on the number of days in the hospital or visits to hospital clinics.</p>
        <p>White House officials say the standard benefits will include coverage for services provided by community health centers and other clinics serving low-income people.</p>
        <p>It will also include coverage of preventive services like immunizations, prenatal care, mammograms, Pap smears and routine physical examinations, provided they are performed at regular intervals specified by the Government.</p>
        <p>The Administration is considering requirements for coverage of mental health care, occupational therapy and physical therapy, but has not decided how to limit the scope or cost of these services.</p>
        <p>Tipper Gore, the wife of Vice President Al Gore, has repeatedly said that mental illness must be covered on the same basis as physical illness. Private insurance policies often restrict coverage of mental health care by setting limits on the number of days of hospitalization, the number of therapy sessions or the total cost. Many Administration officials want to abolish such limits and are seeking other ways to control costs.</p>
        <p>The Administration wants to include hearing, vision and dental services for children, but has not decided how far to go in covering such care for adults.</p>
        <p>In the campaign, Mr. Clinton said he would expand coverage of long-term care for elderly and disabled people. The standard benefits will probably include some long-term care, emphasizing services provided outside nursing homes. But long-term care is expensive, and the new benefits may be introduced gradually over 10 or 20 years, Administration officials say.</p>
        <p>The basic benefit package will almost certainly include treatment for drug abuse. Hillary Rodham Clinton, head of the task force developing the President's plan, has said that treatment for mental illness and drug abuse must be included because they are "a problem that permeates the whole system." Dr. Steven A. Schroeder, president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, says, "Substance abuse -- cigarettes, alcohol and drug abuse -- is the nation's No. 1 health problem."</p>
