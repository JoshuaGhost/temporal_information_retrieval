        <p>Reaching for Audiences</p>
        <p>It's a hectic time in the Broadway season, with several shows opening (and three, alas, closing), the Tony nominations looming and the annual summer drought on the horizon. The general sense that shows are jockeying for position is confirmed by some recent shifts in marketing strategies.</p>
        <p>To begin with, two new musicals are staggering after a critical pounding. The brassy, ubiquitous ads for "Ain't Broadway Grand" apparently did not lift attendance much, and the producers have now adopted a strategy of silence. After opening night, contrary to general practice, they would not supply weekly Variety with box-office totals for the first week, leaving the magazine to estimate receipts at a paltry $137,000. The show's press representative, Fred Nathan, said sales were slightly better this week than last, although he would not give figures. On Wednesday, the show ran a newspaper ad with a probably unique offer: any patrons who, by intermission, didn't like the show enough to stay until the end, could have their money back. (At Wednesday's matinee, seven people claimed the refund but were turned down because they had bought discount tickets.)</p>

        <p>Reaching for Audiences</p>
        <p>It's a hectic time in the Broadway season, with several shows opening (and three, alas, closing), the Tony nominations looming and the annual summer drought on the horizon. The general sense that shows are jockeying for position is confirmed by some recent shifts in marketing strategies.</p>
        <p>To begin with, two new musicals are staggering after a critical pounding. The brassy, ubiquitous ads for "Ain't Broadway Grand" apparently did not lift attendance much, and the producers have now adopted a strategy of silence. After opening night, contrary to general practice, they would not supply weekly Variety with box-office totals for the first week, leaving the magazine to estimate receipts at a paltry $137,000. The show's press representative, Fred Nathan, said sales were slightly better this week than last, although he would not give figures. On Wednesday, the show ran a newspaper ad with a probably unique offer: any patrons who, by intermission, didn't like the show enough to stay until the end, could have their money back. (At Wednesday's matinee, seven people claimed the refund but were turned down because they had bought discount tickets.)</p>
        <p>"If we get to the Tonys, I think we'll get some nominations,' said Arthur Rubin, the show's producer. "We're just trying to survive right now."</p>
        <p>Bill Kenwright, the producer of "Blood Brothers," said he was flabbergasted by that show's poor notices. "I cannot take on board these reviews," he said, "because people in the theater don't just stand when the show's over. They scream, they bay, at the actors." Mr. Kenwright blamed "an American fear of melodrama and of the unknown" for the critical reaction.</p>
        <p>The advertising, he said, would reflect the idea that "Blood Brothers" is a show appreciated by audiences, as opposed to critics. Indeed, this week, in quotationless print ads, the copy equates the number of performances with the number of standing ovations. (There's a strain of optimism in this strategy: the ad in Sunday's Arts and Leisure section of The New York Times, printed early Wednesday morning, already gives the show credit for standing O's through tomorrow night.)</p>
        <p>"Fool Moon" is doing well, but not well enough, said its producer, James B. Freydberg, who decided to change his ad strategy based on his own informal audience survey. "I'd ask people in the audience why they came to see it," he said, "and consistently they said: 'Well, I didn't really want to come. I came with my friend.' I mean, these are people who liked the show."</p>
        <p>The fact that it's a wordless show is apparently a turnoff. "People think it's something it isn't: a mime show," Mr. Freydberg said. His new campaign begins in print ads today. The copy reads, "Ask anyone who's seen it." He will also begin local television advertising on the same theme.</p>
        <p>"We're grossing around $200,000 a week," he said. "We can gross around $300,000."</p>
        <p>One show having no trouble attracting customers right now is "Tommy," which set a box office record on Friday, selling nearly $500,000 worth of tickets the day after it opened to a thunderous critical reception, and continuing to wrap about $200,000 daily since then.</p>
        <p>The producers, Dodger Productions and Pace Theatrical Group, are clearly in a strike-while-the-iron-is-hot mode. The current strategy is an extension of what's been going on for months, now using the ammunition of the reviews and sales.</p>
        <p>"One always has a responsibility to nurture and care for the baby, and 'Tommy' has been embraced and held the same way," said Michael David, a Dodger partner. "But our hope was that it had the potential to reach a broader-than-usual audience. So we took what was our usual preparation and divided it into two categories, for traditional and nontraditional theatergoers."</p>
        <p>Among other things, that means two sets of radio commercials -- one for rock-and-roll stations, one for classical music and news stations -- and employing advertising outlets like national magazines, usually eschewed by Broadway. This week, ads in six magazines (Esquire, GQ, Rolling Stone, New York, Time and Entertainment Weekly) coincided with the opening, and while listeners on WNEW-FM heard music-heavy radio spots with scripts about what a celebrity-laden event the opening night was, on WQXR listeners heard laudatory snatches from reviews.</p>
        <p>The point of the marketing, Mr. David said, is the same as the point of creating the show in the first place. "With 'Tommy' we had two jobs," he said. "One was to put this onstage for people who know it already, in a manner and at a volume that would not let them down. The other was to attempt to construct a show for Broadway that was of interest to and fulfilling for theatergoers. The fear is that you fail in both of those. But you also don't want to gain one audience and lose another." Footlights</p>
        <p>*George C. Scott plays his final performance in "Wrong Turn at Lungfish" on Sunday. For two weeks, the playwright, Garry Marshall, is to stand in. Then, beginning May 18, the role of Peter Ravenswaal, a blind hospital patient, will be filled by Fritz Weaver. For now, Tony Danza and Jami Gertz will stay with the show. (Eventually, Michael E. Knight, a star of the television soap opera "All My Children," is to replace Mr. Danza.)</p>
        <p>*The Tony Awards Administration Committee has announced that a special award at this year's ceremony on June 6 will go to "Oklahoma!," recognizing its 50th anniversary. The Tony for outstanding regional theater was won by the La Jolla Playhouse in California, a 10-year-old theater that has developed, among other things, "Tommy." Other honorary awards this year will go to the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators, the stagehands' union, celebrating its centenary, and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.</p>
        <p>*Pixie Judy Troupe, the children's theater company, begins performances of "The Thief of Bagdad" this afternoon at 4. This is the group's first production in its new home, the Mazur Theater at Asphalt Green, 555 East 90th Street, Manhattan.</p>
        <p>*"Laughter on the 23d Floor," the new Neil Simon comedy due on Broadway in the fall, is based on Mr. Simon's experience writing for Sid Caesar and "Your Show of Shows" in the 1950's. Nathan Lane has been cast in the Caesar-ish role, and on Friday, Mr. Simon and the director, Jerry Zaks, asked Paul Provenza, a stand-up comic who appeared Off Broadway in "Only Kidding" in 1988, to play the character modeled on Mel Brooks.</p>
        <p>*Speaking of Neil Simon and Sid Caesar, at the Friars Club tribute to the former at the Waldorf on Sunday night, the latter stole the show with 15 minutes of tour de force laudatory patter in semblances of four languages, none of them resembling English. The evening did, however, get off to a rocky start when Dick Cavett and Chevy Chase had to apologize for their jokes and Mayor David N. Dinkins, in an otherwise graceful speech, thanked Mr. Simon for his theatrical contributions from "Come Blow Your Horn" in 1961 "right up to his current success with 'Jake's Women.' "</p>
