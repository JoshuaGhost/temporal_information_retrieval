        <p>Just three days before a referendum on Boris N. Yeltsin's performance as Russia's President, Russia's top law enforcement officer today accused Mr. Yeltsin's Defense Minister of involvement in the illegal sale of military property in the former East Germany.</p>
        <p>The charges against Gen. Pavel S. Grachev were made by Valentin G. Stepankov, the Procurator General of Russia, whose job is roughly that of an attorney general in the United States. They came only days after Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who has broken with Mr. Yeltsin, accused various Yeltsin officials of corruption.</p>

        <p>Just three days before a referendum on Boris N. Yeltsin's performance as Russia's President, Russia's top law enforcement officer today accused Mr. Yeltsin's Defense Minister of involvement in the illegal sale of military property in the former East Germany.</p>
        <p>The charges against Gen. Pavel S. Grachev were made by Valentin G. Stepankov, the Procurator General of Russia, whose job is roughly that of an attorney general in the United States. They came only days after Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, who has broken with Mr. Yeltsin, accused various Yeltsin officials of corruption.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Rutskoi's speech, allegations of Government corruption have been the centerpiece of the anti-Yeltsin campaign before Sunday's referendum, which will offer Russians a chance to support Mr. Yeltsin and his vision of economic reforms or to repudiate them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rutskoi, a former air force pilot who has become the chief spokesman for the opposition, has announced his intention to run for President in any new elections. Sale of Military Property</p>
        <p>In his speech to the Russian Parliament, Mr. Rutskoi concentrated in particular on assertions of the illegal sale of military property belonging to Soviet troops withdrawing from the former East Germany, suggesting an official coverup of the investigation. He promised to hand over his evidence to the Procurator General. Mr. Stepankov, who himself has been increasingly critical of Mr. Yeltsin and who spoke to the Supreme Soviet immediately after Mr. Rutskoi, acted quickly in what Yeltsin officials called a political maneuver.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued to the Itar- Tass news agency, the Prosecutor General's office said that it had "discovered new facts of abuse of official position" by the commanders of former Soviet troops in Eastern Germany, known as the Western Group of Forces, and by officials in the Defense Ministry, "including Defense Minister Pavel Grachev personally." Another Corruption Case</p>
        <p>General Grachev, who was in Siberia today reviewing troops, was unavailable for comment. He has urged the armed forces to maintain neutrality in the political struggle between Mr. Yeltsin and the Parliament. But General Grachev is regarded as an ally of Mr. Yeltsin, who appointed him, and the opposition is worried that Mr. Yeltsin may try to force through political changes after the referendum by threatening to use the army.</p>
        <p>The prosecution statement also said that Gennadi Burbulis, a close adviser to Mr. Yeltsin who is despised by conservatives, would be questioned in another corruption case involving the smuggling of a substance known as "red mercury," which Western scientists regard as worthless.</p>
        <p>It is not known if these charges will have any impact on the referendum due to take place across Russia on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yeltsin has admitted that some corruption exists, though not to the degree alleged by Mr. Rutskoi. But he criticized Mr. Rutskoi today for not submitting any documents on corruption sooner, "instead of accumulating them for months until the right moment and waiting for the referendum on the President to begin." Officials charged "should respond according to the law," he said.</p>
        <p>In the four-question plebiscite, Russian voters will be asked if they trust Mr. Yeltsin as President, if they support the social and economic policies of his Government in 1992, and if they favor early elections for the Presidency and for the legislature.</p>
        <p>Opinion polls suggest that between 55 percent and 60 percent of Russians will vote, with a small majority for Mr. Yeltsin and against new presidential elections, a small majority against his 1992 policies, and a more sizable majority for early legislative elections. The Russian Constitutional Court has ruled that the votes on early elections must pass with more than 50 percent of all registered voters, which is unlikely.</p>
