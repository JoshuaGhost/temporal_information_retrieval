        <p>'Drawing Into Film' 'Directors' Drawings'  Pace Gallery 32 East 57th Street Manhattan Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>A movie buff's delight, "Drawing Into Film" presents sketches and drawings that well-known directors, from Sergei Eisenstein and Orson Welles to David Lynch and Martin Scorsese, have made in preparing some of their most famous films. Among the treats here are Federico Fellini's hilarious caricatures of bulbous women for his "City of Women" (1980), Tim Burton's pen-and-ink ghouls for "Beetlejuice" (1988) and two sketches by John Huston for "Moby-Dick" (1956), showing Ahab, crop in hand, riding the whale as if it were a stallion.</p>

        <p>'Drawing Into Film' 'Directors' Drawings'  Pace Gallery 32 East 57th Street Manhattan Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>A movie buff's delight, "Drawing Into Film" presents sketches and drawings that well-known directors, from Sergei Eisenstein and Orson Welles to David Lynch and Martin Scorsese, have made in preparing some of their most famous films. Among the treats here are Federico Fellini's hilarious caricatures of bulbous women for his "City of Women" (1980), Tim Burton's pen-and-ink ghouls for "Beetlejuice" (1988) and two sketches by John Huston for "Moby-Dick" (1956), showing Ahab, crop in hand, riding the whale as if it were a stallion.</p>
        <p>Many of the drawings are simply rough-and-ready sketches intended to indicate the framing and sequencing of shots. Sometimes these notations provide remarkably detailed information about the director's concept of the film, as in Fred Zinnemann's thumbnail sketches for "Forbidden Passage" (1941), which were executed directly on the pages of the script.</p>
        <p>A few of the drawings have a visual sophistication that belies their utilitarian origins, notably Akira Kurosawa's pastel-and-watercolor images from the segment of "Dreams" (1990) devoted to van Gogh, and Mr. Lynch's obsessive, Surrealistic landscapes for "Dune" (1984).</p>
        <p>But much of the interest here comes from comparing the sketches to the films. Video excerpts from the finished films accompany each director's drawings, allowing viewers to compare, say, the 52 detailed storyboard sketches Mr. Scorsese drew for a fight sequence in "Raging Bull" (1980) with the riveting, intricately orchestrated passage in the film itself. Similar delights abound in this ambitious, fascinating show.</p>
