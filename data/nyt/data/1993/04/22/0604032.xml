        <p>The Bristol-Myers Squibb Company reported lackluster results for the first quarter yesterday. Sales rose only 4 percent from the period a year earlier, after subtracting 2 percentage points for changes in foreign-exchange rates. Profits from continuing operations were up 7.6 percent as cost-cutting measures took hold.</p>
        <p>Formally stated, profits showed a 90.6 percent gain, reflecting noncash accounting changes last year, which recognized benefits promised to retirees, and a reduction in earnings after the sale in December of the Drackett household products unit.</p>

        <p>Jerry Parrott, a company spokesman, said drug unit sales rose 12 percent. He noted that a scientific advisory panel recently recommended Food and Drug Administration approval for an additional use for Capoten, the company's main heart drug. Arvind Desai, an analyst at Mehta &amp; Isaly Worldwide Pharmaceutical Research, said Capoten, which had $1.6 billion in worldwide sales last year, "continued to lose share" in a crowded American market.</p>
