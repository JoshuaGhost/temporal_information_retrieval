        <p>THE Greek Easter table reflects the country's regional culinary differences. How recipes have evolved depends on the lay of the land, on what is available place by place, and on the tastes and origins of the local population.</p>
        <p>The holiday -- Orthodox Easter, which is on April 18 this year -- is also a celebration of spring, a time when the normally dust-dry Greek landscape bursts with color and vegetation. Fresh herbs and tender young greens -- dill, wild fennel, lemon balm, lettuce, sorrel and spinach -- crop up on island and mainland menus alike.</p>
        <p>Cheese, eggs and richly scented breads play an important part, but meat is always the centerpiece of the meal. On the mainland, lamb is generally the meat of choice. In the islands, especially those in the Aegean Sea, it is goat.</p>
        <p>While the stereotypical image of the day brings to mind heroic feasts -- lamb roasted whole on a spit -- the outdoor rotisserie is a custom of the southern region of mainland Greece and the Peloponnesus, the peninsula to the south. It has trickled into the Easter cookery of other places, perhaps because it seems lavish and fun, but the traditional island goat rarely gets turned on the spit.</p>
        <p>It is the custom on Aegean islands like Andros, Samos, Icaria, Lesbos, and Rhodes to stuff a whole side of goat and to take it to the village baker early on Easter Sunday. "The women stuff; the men roast," said Nikos Kouvdos, one of the bakers in Raches, on Icaria in the eastern Aegean.</p>
        <p>On Icaria, where paucity rules what is served, women collect garden greens for the stuffing. Two local treats, both of which grow wild, are poppy leaves and lemon balm. On nearby Samos, the main course is similar, with the addition of pine nuts in the stuffing. On Lesbos, the typical rice filling is seasoned with cinnamon, sugar and almonds, reflecting the island's proximity to Turkey.</p>
        <p>On other Aegean islands, especially the Cyclades, and some of the Dodecanese, in the southeast, making a fresh whey cheese not unlike ricotta is a rite of spring. Called anthotyro, or blossom cheese, it is used in both savory and sweet Easter dishes. All over the Aegean, sweet cheese tartlets are baked just for Easter Sunday. They come in various shapes -- some like stars, others like little packets -- and are flavored with cinnamon, orange-blossom water or mahlepi, made from black-cherry kernels.</p>
        <p>Combinations of cheese and lamb or goat are also common. Each Easter, when Tonia Roumbaki, an architect who lives in Athens, heads to Sphakia, Crete, her hometown, her aunt has tourta waiting. The dish is like brioche filled with soft whey cheese, lamb and cinnamon. "We use cinnamon a lot on Crete, at Easter time and all year round," she said.</p>
        <p>Although Crete, all the way to the south, is the only place in Greece where an Easter pie is made with meat and cheese, elsewhere the combination is common. On Andros, one of the Cyclades, the goat or lamb is richly filled with fresh cheese and eggs, in addition to the standard rice.</p>
        <p>On Rhodes, one of the Dodecanese, another stuffed goat dish is called lambriatis: the name comes from the word lambri, meaning bright, which is synonymous with Easter. Lambriatis includes the local kefalotyri, a hard yellow sheep's milk cheese, as well as spring onions, parsley, dill, rice and innards. The whole thing is cooked in a deep clay dish sealed with a cover of dough.</p>
        <p>The Easter table everywhere in Greece is supposed to be as lavish as possible. The foods are filling and heavy. In the Aegean the dishes, for all their ingenuity, reflect the scarcity of ingredients in a sparse terrain, but elsewhere the Easter table is decidedly richer.</p>
        <p>On the Ionian island of Corfu, off the northwestern coast of Greece, for example, the abstinence of Lent -- no meat or dairy products -- is broken with a delicate dish of sauteed liver seasoned with dill, parsley, mint and vinegar or in some recipes, with cinnamon, cloves and oregano.</p>
        <p>It is one of the few places in the country where the soup called mayieritsa -- made from any variety of sauteed innards, herbs and lettuce, and bound with avgolemono, the country's well-known egg-and-lemon sauce -- is not the dish of choice to end Lent.</p>
        <p>"Mayieritsa, when it's made at all in Corfu, is made more as a stew with a thick egg-and-lemon sauce," said Dr. Sophia Mylona, a physician in Athens and a native of Corfu.</p>
        <p>On Cephalonia, the soup reflects the region's Venetian past and proximity to Italy. Tomato, allspice, cinnamon, bay leaf and garlic flavor the broth, not egg and lemon.</p>
        <p>On the mainland, especially in Thessaly and Macedonia, people show an appetite for innards in every shape and form. "We're used to having many animals and to eating every part," said Andonis Vassiliadis, a retired banker who was born in Volos, in Thessaly. Even when it is not Easter, tripe dishes abound. A local Easter specialty in Thessaly is lamb's caul stuffed with innards and herbs and baked in tomato sauce.</p>
        <p>Farther north in parts of Macedonia, where much of the local population emigrated from Asia Minor, another Easter dish made with caul fat is called sarma. There, it is filled with sweetbreads and liver, rice and herbs. A similar dish, called trimma, is found in Epirus, over the Pindus range in northwestern Greece. There, ample eggs, liver, sorrel (one of the many local wild greens), bread crumbs and cheese form the filling.  Peloponnesian Tsoureki (Braided Easter Bread)</p>
        <p>Total time: about 6 hours  2 cups milk, plus 2 tablespoons  2 envelopes active dry yeast  8 cups bread flour, plus additional flour for dusting  1 3/4 cups sugar  1 cup almonds, very finely chopped  1 teaspoon salt  Grated rind of 1 orange  2 teaspoons finely ground anise seed  1/4 cup olive oil, plus additional oil for greasing the pans  5 eggs, very well beaten  4 dyed hard-boiled eggs  1 egg yolk, slightly beaten  Slivered almonds to sprinkle over the loaves.</p>
        <p>1. Warm the 2 cups of milk and place in a large bowl. Add the yeast, 1 cup of the flour and 1/4 cup of the sugar. Cover, and set aside in a warm place until the mixture becomes spongy, about 1 hour.</p>
        <p>2. In a large bowl combine the remaining 7 cups flour, the chopped almonds, salt, remaining sugar, orange rind and anise seed. Make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture, olive oil and beaten eggs. Stir, working outward, until a dough forms.</p>
        <p>3. Dust a work surface with a little flour, and knead the dough, adding more flour if necessary, until it is smooth and doesn't stick to your fingers, about 12 minutes. Place in an oiled bowl, cover with a cloth, and set aside in a warm, draft-free place to rise until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.</p>
        <p>4. Punch the dough down. Divide into 6 small balls, and roll each into strips 12 to 15 inches long and about 2 inches in diameter. Lay 3 strips side by side, pinch them together at one end, and braid. Pinch the braids together at the other end to hold the loaf together. Press 2 dyed eggs between the strips of the braid.</p>
        <p>5. Repeat the procedure to make a second loaf. Place the loaves on a lightly oiled baking sheet, cover with the cloth, and let rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.</p>
        <p>6. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Beat together the egg yolk and the 2 tablespoons milk. Brush over each loaf, and sprinkle each with the slivered almonds. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown. The loaves should sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Remove from the oven and cool on racks.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 loaves, 6 to 8 servings each.</p>

        <p>Total time: 2 1/4 hours  1 1/4 cups warm water  1 envelope active dry yeast  4 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional flour for dusting  1 teaspoon salt  1/4 cup olive oil, plus 2 tablespoons and additional oil for greasing  4 eggs  4 scallions, both green and white parts, finely chopped  2 pounds lean boneless lamb, shredded or diced  2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  1 pound Greek anthotyro cheese or fresh ricotta  1/2 pound Cretan gravieri cheese, shredded (see note)  Sesame seeds to sprinkle on top of pie.</p>
        <p>1. Dissolve the yeast in the warm water. In a medium bowl, combine 4 cups of the flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Make a well in the center. Add the yeast mixture, the 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 eggs, very well beaten. Stir with a fork from the center outward until a dough begins to form. Lightly dust a work surface with flour. Knead the dough until silky to the touch, 10 to 12 minutes, adding more flour if necessary. Grease a bowl with olive oil.  Place the dough in the bowl, cover, and allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</p>
        <p>2. In a heavy skillet, heat the 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add the scallions, and saute over medium heat until wilted. Add the lamb. Season with cinnamon, salt and pepper. Brown, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Combine the anthotyro or ricotta with the shredded gravieri cheese. Stir in 1 egg.</p>
        <p>4. Lightly oil a 9-inch springform pan. Divide the dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the first half to a circle about 13 inches in diameter. Place on the bottom of the pan, and lightly press around the sides. There should be at least an inch of dough hanging over the pan's top rim. Spread half the lamb on the bottom of the pan. Spread half the cheese mixture evenly over it. Repeat with the remaining lamb and cheese. Roll out the second half of the dough, and place over the filling. Trim the edges, leaving 1 to 1 1/2 inches of dough hanging over the outer sides of the pan. Roll up the dough to form a rim of crust around the top of the pan. Cover, and set aside for 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Beat the remaining egg. With a sharp knife make four slits in the surface of the dough. Brush the dough with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for about 50 minutes, until the pastry is golden and begins to separate from the sides of the pan. Cool slightly on a rack. Remove the sides of the pan just before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: Cretan gravieri cheese is available at many cheese stores. In Manhattan, one source is the Ninth Avenue Cheese Market, 525 Ninth Avenue (39th Street).</p>
