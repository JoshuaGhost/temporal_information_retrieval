        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Anna Quindlen contends in "But Not Both" (column, March 31), on the Kelly Michaels child sex abuse case, that evocation of the Salem witch trials by Ms. Michaels's supporters was "a cheap and easy metaphor that implies malevolent hysteria." The parents whose children testified, she states, "truly believed that those children were violated and that they still show the effects."</p>
        <p>It was I who referred to the witch trials in my appellate argument on Ms. Michaels's behalf, and I believe Ms. Quindlen misunderstands those faraway cases. While historical analogies are seldom on all fours, it is indisputable that the witch trials that contorted New England in the waning years of the 17th century were generated, not by "malevolent hysteria," but, as John Putnam Demos concludes in the fascinating book "Entertaining Satan," by people sincerely convinced they were participants in a "front-line struggle against the Devil and his legions."</p>
        <p>It was never our purpose to denigrate the parents of the alleged "victims" of Ms. Michaels. Undoubtedly, they were genuinely overwhelmed by the possibility that their children had been sexually abused. If anyone in this tragic case was "malevolent," it was the investigators who employed what the appellate court condemned as "improper interview techniques" in interrogating these preschool children and the prosecutors who used the results to secure indictments and convictions. The parallel between such unfair methods in 1692 and 1985 was so startling that I felt that the comparison was both fair and enlightening. WILLIAM M. KUNSTLER  New York, March 31, 1993</p>
