        <p>This time there was no plane left waiting on the tarmac.</p>
        <p>Unlike Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's last trip to the precipice, when he made preparations to fly to New Hampshire to file for the 1992 Presidential primary, there was no symbol of angst today about the Governor's decision to withdraw his name from consideration for the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Cuomo's aides and friends said, the Governor showed a surprising ambivalence about the court from the very beginning. And he seemed uncommonly at peace today with his decision.</p>
        <p>While his staff almost universally encouraged him to take the job if it was offered, Mr. Cuomo focused immediately on what he considered its shortcomings, his aides said. 'Hard to Accept'</p>
        <p>It was too confining. It was too passive. You could not speak your mind on radio and television. It was high on intellectual stimulation but low on instant gratification of either the ego or the soul.</p>
        <p>"People find it hard to accept -- it's such an exalted position and all that -- but he just didn't want to be a judge," said Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development and a Cuomo confidante. "It's not where his experience and talents lie."</p>
        <p>Another Cuomo aide said: "Unlike the Presidency, everyone on the staff wanted him to do it. He just never got there."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo never got there at least in part because of a singular desire for political closure.</p>
        <p>After a glorious first term, when he invigorated state government, shot to national stardom with a memorable speech and won re-election by a record margin, Mr. Cuomo's last six years have been increasingly difficult. His critics place part of the blame on the state's flagging economy and part on the Governor's style, which can be long on proposals and short on the grittier business of effecting change. Strengthening His Grip</p>
        <p>Having endured hard times, Mr. Cuomo sees an opportunity for a fiscal revival for his state and a political rejuvenation for himself, his closest friends and aides said. He envisions a chance to create the legacy that has eluded him, to set a mark for endurance, to finish the way he started.</p>
        <p>While other politicians instinctively reach for the next rung, Mr. Cuomo prefers to solidify his grip on the rung before him.</p>
        <p>He once mused disdainfully that it was a distinctively American failing that politicians always strive for higher office rather than making a difference where they are. And even though it was his mother, an Italian immigrant named Immaculata, who asked him after his first gubernatorial election when he was going to become a judge, Mr. Cuomo has always had one foot in the old country and one in the new.</p>
        <p>"There's a natural assumption that this is such a grand and important position that everything should fall before it," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview. "But that's a judgment individuals have to make and I made mine and that's it." Even Young Children</p>
        <p>The reason, of course, that people find it hard to accept that Mr. Cuomo did not want to sit on the Supreme Court is that he seems so intellectually and temperamentally suited to the job. He remains fascinated by the law and thrives on spirited debate and the dissection of belief.</p>
        <p>As he explained in a radio interview this week, Mr. Cuomo regularly even challenges young children about the foundations of their world.</p>
        <p>"I'll say, 'How old are you?' and they'll say, 'Nine.' " he began. "And then to just give a small, and I hope inoffensive, presentation of the Talmudic process, I say, 'How do you know?' "</p>
        <p>"They say, 'Because I'm 9.' "</p>
        <p>"Well how do you know?"</p>
        <p>" 'Well, because my mother told me.' "</p>
        <p>"Well, do you believe everything your mother told you? Maybe you're 17, and she doesn't want you to know because she doesn't want you to drive yet. Did you believe her when she told you there was a Santa Claus?"</p>
        <p>Is it farfetched to think that, with Mr. Cuomo on the Court, a debate over Roe v. Wade would have begun with the question, "Justice Scalia, what color is your robe?" Another New York No</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo, by the way, is not the only New Yorker who does not want to be considered by President Clinton for the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye of the New York Court of Appeals, whom Mr. Cuomo promoted for the job after withdrawing his own name, said today that she also preferred to stay in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuomo has said in interviews over the last two days that he simply believes he can be of more service in New York than in Washington. He has been energized in recent months by a series of crises he has helped manage, ranging from the World Trade Center bombing to the bankruptcy of The New York Post.</p>
        <p>And he clearly has been buoyed by the gradual improvement in the state's economy and the relative ease of putting together this year's state budget. While he said today that he does not expect New York's fiscal condition to improve to the level of the mid-1980's, he is hopeful that the days of heavy deficits are behind him. That would allow him to focus on the issues that one Cuomo aide characterized today as "legacy pieces:" health care, changes in the public schools and environmental protection. Baloney and Garbage</p>
        <p>If Mr. Cuomo runs for, wins and completes a fourth four-year term, he would surpass the 14-year mark set by Nelson Rockefeller, a record second only to the 25 years served by New York's first Governor, George Clinton.</p>
        <p>Some in Albany, including members of the Governor's staff, have questioned why anybody would want the job for that long. They have hypothesized that Mr. Cuomo must take some psychic pleasure in the petty disputes with the Legislature that occupy so much of his time.</p>
        <p>"That's a lot of baloney, that's a lot of garbage," Mr. Cuomo said today. "You think I enjoy being in there for hours disagreeing with Marino and Weprin. What am I, perverted? I'd rather be reading a book or writing poetry.</p>
        <p>"You can't enjoy it. A lot of it is unnecessary. The whole system stinks. You don't do it because it's fun. You do it because you feel you're making a contribution toward improving things."</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Cuomo noted that it has been a season for comebacks in New York -- for the economy, for the trade center, for The Post, metaphors all perhaps for the political comeback he may envision for himself.</p>
