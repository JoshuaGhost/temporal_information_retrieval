        <p>The last time Jennifer Capriati saw Rome, an unsung South African named Amanda Coetzer had just ousted her in the third round of the 1992 Italian Open and, adding insult to injury, the local tennis critics attributed the loss to an excess of weight on her own naturally unpetite frame.</p>

        <p>The last time Jennifer Capriati saw Rome, an unsung South African named Amanda Coetzer had just ousted her in the third round of the 1992 Italian Open and, adding insult to injury, the local tennis critics attributed the loss to an excess of weight on her own naturally unpetite frame.</p>
        <p>Capriati took the defeat, and the criticism, to heart; in fact, she cried over both, but she avenged herself on both fronts today in the quarterfinals of the Family Circle Magazine Cup.</p>
        <p>"The main thing was that I stayed patient the whole time, that when it got tight in the first set, I didn't just totally lose it," said Capriati, who fell behind by 1-3 before blasting her way past Coetzer, 6-4, 6-0.</p>
        <p>Instead of losing it, Capriati continued to win back her confidence, which took a nosedive when she failed to advance beyond the third round in the Lipton at Key Biscayne, Fla., last month. Sanchez Vicario Advances</p>
        <p>Sleeker at 17, and less inclined to treat her tennis as a necessary evil in her teeming teen-age existence, Capriati calmly assured herself of a semifinal confrontation with Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. The Spaniard reached her fourth consecutive semifinal by outhitting unseeded Sabine Hack, 6-2, 6-2.</p>
        <p>In the other semifinal on Saturday, the defending champion, Gabriela Sabatini, will face her perennial nemesis, top-seeded Steffi Graf, who leads their series, 23-11.</p>
        <p>Sabatini made quick work of sixth-seeded Katerina Maleeva, bowling her over, 6-4, 6-2, with an abundance of wind-driven topspin. Graf took just 50 minutes to show unseeded 17-year-old Chanda Rubin the exit, 6-1, 6-2.</p>
        <p>When the day's four quarterfinals were complete, the four top-seeded players remained in the event, a scenario that occurred for the fifth time this year.  Graf Overawes Opponent</p>
        <p>In summarizing her downfall to Graf, Rubin correctly pointed to a lack of patience.</p>
        <p>"I play a lot of players ranked 100 and know what I have to do to beat them," said the 94th-ranked Rubin. But against Graf, said the abashed Louisianan, for whom forgetting the identity of her opponent had been a must, "I forgot I was playing tennis, almost."</p>
        <p>Coetzer also showed a lack of fortitude, despite trying to convince herself that Capriati would not be raring for revenge.</p>
        <p>"My main strategy would have been to not get intimidated, try and play my own game and not let her dictate," said Coetzer, who last year jumped 50 spots in the ranking from No. 67 to a career-high 17, a rise that had its genesis in Rome at Capriati's expense. 'Little Bit of Fear'</p>
        <p>"You never know what she's going to do next," said Coetzer, "so you might have a little bit of a fear that she might go for a winner, and you feel pressured to do the same."</p>
        <p>What Capriati wanted to pre-empt was Coetzer's penchant for prolonging points with hazy topspin.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to show her that she was not going to moonball me to death, and then I'd get impatient," said Capriati. "Today my confidence was there."</p>
        <p>And so was Sanchez Vicario's, which always seems to be the case. While Capriati can indeed be "temperamental," as her victim today noted, Sanchez Vicario plays at an even keel, regardless of situation or opponent.</p>
        <p>"It's going to be tough," said Capriati, 2-2 in career meetings with Sanchez Vicario. "I'm just going to have to be ready to be out there a long time and fight."  TENNIS</p>
