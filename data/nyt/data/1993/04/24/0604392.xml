        <p>The new Benham Utilities Income Fund is designed to provide capital growth and monthly income from high-paying utilities stocks plus some bonds. The fund yields a hefty 4.52 percent, but should be held only by people who plan to invest for five years or more. Because of the heavy income component, share prices should fluctuate less than nondividend-paying stock funds. But utilities are susceptible to inflation. Benham is one of only a handful of no-load utilities funds.</p>
        <p>Conservative stock fund investors might consider the new T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth fund, which invests mainly in high-quality dividend-paying stocks. The fund, riding a trend toward conservative stock funds, differs from the Price Equity-Income and Growth-and-Income Funds by focusing more on dividend growth. Companies with rising dividends tend to be more established.</p>

        <p>Investors exhausted by the tax season might appreciate the Twentieth Century Tax-Exempt Short-Term Fund, one of the few short-term tax-free bond funds. Short-term bonds react less to changing interest rates than longer-term issues. The trade-off is a smaller yield: 3.16 percent, compared with 4.21 percent for Twentieth Century's intermediate tax-free fund, 4.73 percent for its long-term fund. The 0.65 percent management fee is being waived through 1993.</p>
