        <p>John W. Kluge, the chairman of the Metromedia Company and a 1937 graduate of Columbia University, presented his alma mater last night with $60 million for minority scholarships. It is the largest gift the university has ever received.</p>
        <p>In making his gift, Mr. Kluge recalled what a hardship it was for him to afford his tuition -- only $500 a year at the time -- when he was earning $7 a week working in the school dining hall. Fortunately for him, he said, Columbia helped by giving him a scholarship.</p>

        <p>John W. Kluge, the chairman of the Metromedia Company and a 1937 graduate of Columbia University, presented his alma mater last night with $60 million for minority scholarships. It is the largest gift the university has ever received.</p>
        <p>In making his gift, Mr. Kluge recalled what a hardship it was for him to afford his tuition -- only $500 a year at the time -- when he was earning $7 a week working in the school dining hall. Fortunately for him, he said, Columbia helped by giving him a scholarship.</p>
        <p>"Columbia made a difference really in my life and I really want to assure that it will continue to make a difference for others," Mr. Kluge said in an interview from his office in Manhattan. At 78, Mr. Kluge, who made his fortune building up a string of radio and television stations, is one of the wealthiest people in America.</p>
        <p>By itself, the $60 million donation is believed to be the fifth largest to any university or college. When added to the $50 million Mr. Kluge already donated to Columbia in two previous gifts, it would be second only to the $125 million pledged to Louisiana State University in 1981 by Claude B. Pennington.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Kluge's two previous gifts of $25 million, presented in 1987, was also for minority scholarships and the other, in 1990, went to aid young scholars and junior faculty members.</p>
        <p>The new gift comes at a critical time as Columbia battles serious fiscal problems. With its $1 billion operating budget, the university has a $15 million deficit this year and is working to cut costs to balance its budget for next year. Luring Minority Candidates</p>
        <p>But officials of the university said it was unclear whether the gift, because it was specifically for scholarships for undergraduates, would have any impact on the deficit.</p>
        <p>The gift would, they said, help the university attract minority candidates who might otherwise go to other universities better able to help them with steep college costs.</p>
        <p>Fred Knubel, a spokesman for Columbia, said last night that the gift would provide at least 300 students a year with grants of $10,000. Mr. Knubel said that the money would be used in the form of an endowment, and that its interest would go to help minority students selected for admission.</p>
        <p>The university has a "need-blind admissions policy," dating back to the 1960's, which means that qualified students are admitted without regard to their ability to pay. The university then provides financial aid to all those who need it.</p>
        <p>About 36 percent of the 3,422 students at Columbia College, the undergraduate school, are members of minority groups. Of the 862 students in this year's freshmen class at Columbia College, 421 receive some sort of financial aid, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kluge (pronounced KLOO-ghee), who was named the richest American by Forbes magazine in 1989, '90 and '91, said he was not interested in having buildings named after him.</p>
        <p>"I'd rather do something for human minds than for a monument," he said. "It's been offered to me time and again, not only at Columbia but at other colleges, but I'm not interested in having my name on a building.  "This is really what this fund is about, for minority students who would ordinarily not be able to go to school," he said.</p>
        <p>When he was asked why he particularly wants to benefit minority students through, Mr. Kluge answered simply: "I think the need is there. In my small way, I'm addressing that need." Started With a Radio Station</p>
        <p>Mr. Kluge, who was born in Chemnitz, Germany, came to the United States when he was 8 years old. He has admitted to interviewers that he is as surprised as anyone that his financial gambits brought him from a poor upbringing in Detroit to the head of a company that is one of the largest private concerns in the nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kluge served in Army Intelligence during World War II, and afterward bought a radio station and formed Metromedia. Eventually, he bought a string of radio and television stations that no one else seemed to believe were profitable, but he usually made money.</p>
        <p>In later years, Mr. Kluge continued to amass a fortune, buying billboard companies, the Harlem Globetrotters, the Ice Capades and the Bonanza and Steak &amp; Ale restaurant chains among other businesses. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated Mr. Kluge was worth $5.5 billion.  Known for Generosity</p>
        <p>Known for his generosity to other causes, Mr. Kluge delighted especially in timing his gift so he could announce it last night during a tribute to his friend Michael I. Sovern, who is stepping down as Columbia's president June 30.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sovern, who was somewhat surprised by the gift, said he too was thrilled. "He really did want to give me a nice send off, God bless him," he said.</p>
        <p>Historically, according to information from the university's Office of Undergraduate Admissions, Columbia has had the highest percentage of students on financial aid of any of the Ivy League universities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sovern said that dwindling Federal and state aid to education, coupled with the huge tuition increases that the university -- like many others -- has had to impose, has made it more difficult for some students to pay for a Columbia education. About $24,000 a Year</p>
        <p>Tuition is $16,514 a year, and tuition, room and board and other incidentals bring the cost of a year at Columbia to about $24,000 per student.</p>
        <p>When Columbia offered him a scholarship in 1933, Mr. Kluge recalled yesterday, he had offers from other colleges, and he did not believe he could afford Columbia with the amount they were offering. So he decided he would be aggressive, he recalled, and asked them to double the scholarship.</p>
        <p>Columbia officials agreed, and four years later, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics.</p>
        <p>"I really had no money at all," he said about those days.</p>
        <p>"I guess taking the $50 million I already gave them, and doubling it is the basis in kind," he said. "They doubled my scholarship so I'll double theirs."</p>
