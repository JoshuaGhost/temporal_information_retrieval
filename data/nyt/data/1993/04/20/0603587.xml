        <p>The Liberty Media Corporation, sensing an opportunity to make money while bolstering its holdings in Home Shopping Network Inc., offered yesterday to buy up to 17 percent of the outstanding shares of the troubled television marketer at a price below its earlier offer.</p>
        <p>Liberty, a cable televison company based in Denver, said it would pay $7 a share for up to 15 million of Home Shopping's class A common shares. Last week, Liberty withdrew an offer to buy all of the outstanding shares for cash and stock valued at $8.50 to $9 a share. Liberty currently owns 23 percent of Home Shopping's outstanding common shares.</p>

        <p>The Liberty Media Corporation, sensing an opportunity to make money while bolstering its holdings in Home Shopping Network Inc., offered yesterday to buy up to 17 percent of the outstanding shares of the troubled television marketer at a price below its earlier offer.</p>
        <p>Liberty, a cable televison company based in Denver, said it would pay $7 a share for up to 15 million of Home Shopping's class A common shares. Last week, Liberty withdrew an offer to buy all of the outstanding shares for cash and stock valued at $8.50 to $9 a share. Liberty currently owns 23 percent of Home Shopping's outstanding common shares.</p>
        <p>Home Shopping's class A stock, which had been battered in recent weeks, rose $1.75 a share yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, to $6.25, on news of the new offer. 22% Discount</p>
        <p>The earlier deal, which Liberty Media withdrew last week amid a Federal inquiry into accusations involving kickbacks by vendors and other problems at Home Shopping, was valued at about $640 million. By contrast, yesterday's deal was worth about $105 million and represented, on a per share basis, a 22 percent discount from the earlier offer.</p>
        <p>Still, John Field, an analyst with Hanifen Imhoff, a Denver brokerage firm, said he was not disappointed by the offer and saw it as an interim step into a merger between Liberty Media and Home Shopping.</p>
        <p>"In this deal, people can have their cash in 30 days," Mr. Field said. "The earlier offer involved stock, and any time stock is involved you have to discount the value of the offer. You don't discount cash." 'Unfounded Anxieties'</p>
        <p>Peter R. Barton, president and chief executive of Liberty Media, called the offer an important vote of confidence in Home Shopping, based in St. Petersburg, Fla. "We hope this puts the unfounded anxieties about the financial condition of H.S.N. behind us once and for all," Mr. Barton said in a statement.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Liberty Media, Robert Bennett, also said that the Securities and Exchange Commission had told the company last week that it would be requesting information as part of a preliminary inquiry into activities at Home Shopping.</p>
        <p>In December, Liberty paid $178 million in cash and stock for a block of super-voting class B shares from Home Shopping's chairman, Roy M. Speer, giving it voting control of the television marketer.</p>
        <p>Liberty, which also has a large interest in QVC Network Inc., another television retailer, had initially expressed interest in merging some aspects of the two operations. In 1991, Liberty Media was spun off from Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, the nation's largest cable operator, which retains an interest in it.</p>
