        <p>My Mother is the Vince Lombardi of beauty: Looking good isn't everything, it's the only thing. If she passed along one truth when I was growing up, it was that I had an obligation to take care of myself, and she didn't mean it in a feminist kind of way. Years before I reached puberty, she began what she called my "Gigi lessons," after the scene in the movie where Isabel Jeans teaches Leslie Caron how to eat ortolans. "Life is not one big drudge," Mom explained.</p>
        <p>While her curriculum covered fine food (eating, not cooking, it) and helpful hints on choosing and graciously accepting expensive jewelry (a skill that has, alas, gotten rusty), the bulk of her instruction focused on the fine art of body maintenance. Some women have warm fuzzy memories of bonding with Mom in the kitchen, but I get misty when I see the red door of Elizabeth Arden. By the age of 14, I had been introduced to facials, pedicures, manicures, brow waxing, lash tinting, custom-blended makeup and, of course, the psychological advantages of an expert wash and set.</p>

        <p>My Mother is the Vince Lombardi of beauty: Looking good isn't everything, it's the only thing. If she passed along one truth when I was growing up, it was that I had an obligation to take care of myself, and she didn't mean it in a feminist kind of way. Years before I reached puberty, she began what she called my "Gigi lessons," after the scene in the movie where Isabel Jeans teaches Leslie Caron how to eat ortolans. "Life is not one big drudge," Mom explained.</p>
        <p>While her curriculum covered fine food (eating, not cooking, it) and helpful hints on choosing and graciously accepting expensive jewelry (a skill that has, alas, gotten rusty), the bulk of her instruction focused on the fine art of body maintenance. Some women have warm fuzzy memories of bonding with Mom in the kitchen, but I get misty when I see the red door of Elizabeth Arden. By the age of 14, I had been introduced to facials, pedicures, manicures, brow waxing, lash tinting, custom-blended makeup and, of course, the psychological advantages of an expert wash and set.</p>
        <p>"When you look in the mirror and you look good, you feel good," Mom told me. "I always think you should be the best and the prettiest you can be." Wasn't 12 a little young to introduce a make-over as a coping mechanism, I wondered aloud recently. "Not if it made you feel better about yourself," Mom replied.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, as soon as she packed me off to college with a suitcase full of Pantene shampoo, Yardley lip gloss and Neutrogena soap, I rebelled. I let my hair grow wild and frizzy, stopped plucking my eyebrows and began biting my nails, all the while smugly reminding myself that it's what's inside that counts. My fall lasted a couple of years, until the morning I looked in the mirror, got hideously depressed and instinctively sought asylum at Vidal Sassoon. While in theory I believed that looks shouldn't matter, in fact they mattered to me. (This is not to suggest that I'm a fanatic or anything. I don't go in for herbal wraps, liposuction, highlights, low lights or even waxing -- at least not yet.)</p>
        <p>"Obviously your insides have to be more than fluff," Mother scoffed, 20 years later, when she learned I was writing this. She hoped that she hadn't given me the wrong impression: the look she liked was Eleanor Roosevelt on the inside and Grace Kelly on the outside. "If you've got a pretty inside and you're smart, then why not look good outside too?"</p>
        <p>Why not? It certainly gives us a safe topic of conversation. Whatever our differences, we can always swap tips on hair, clothes and makeup, the way fathers and sons talk sports. And I don't have to waste a lot of time reading fashion magazines. Mother, soignee to the fourth power, has the beauty equivalent of the Rand Corporation on call.</p>
        <p>Last week, for example, I happened to mention that I was thinking of cutting my long hair short. Instantly, Mother went on red alert. "You've got to come to New York," she said urgently, flipping through her Rolodex trying to decide which stylist-of-the-moment could give me the best look. I assured her there was no shortage of hair stylists in Los Angeles, but she was skeptical. "Promise you won't do anything until I make a few calls."</p>
        <p>I promised. A year ago, we had practically the same conversation about a more serious beauty problem. I had found a tiny malignant granule in my right breast, in the scar of a four-year-old lumpectomy. It was my worst nightmare come true. Granted, as bad news goes it wasn't awful: every doctor I spoke to assured me that a recurrence in the scar did not significantly alter my chances of being cured. But they all recommended mastectomy. This was a devastating prospect to a woman whose mood fluctuates with the size of her thighs.</p>
        <p>My husband went out of his way to assure me that he would love me no matter how I looked. I knew he meant it too, but I've been vain for over 30 years and I wasn't sure</p>
        <p>I'd</p>
        <p>pass that kind of character test. I demanded simultaneous reconstruction. Mother was totally supportive. "I didn't raise any daughter of mine to scrimp on plastic surgery," she said.</p>
        <p>Mom consulted her beauty cabal and came up with a short list. The top scalpel was booked for a month, but she somehow -- I really don't want to know how -- convinced him to squeeze me in. He recommended a mind-bogglingly difficult surgical procedure called a free gluteal flap. It would take seven or eight hours, but through the miracle of microsurgery, I'd wake up with a new breast, made of my own tissue.</p>
        <p>I asked myself: Am I really vain enough to put myself through this? It was then I knew that I was my mother's daughter. I didn't hesitate. I booked the operation and tried not to panic.</p>
        <p>There wasn't time to panic because every day, via Federal Express from New York, Mother infused me with her version of chicken soup: beauty CARE packages that included a spectrum of eye shadows, matte foundations, blushers, lipsticks, miracle shampoo, magical hair polisher, bath salts from the Dead Sea, pajamas, negligees, camisoles and peig noirs. "Where do you think I'm going?" I asked, "the Golden Door?" "It's important that you feel glamorous," she said, citing a little known principle of psycho neuroimmunology.</p>
        <p>I knew I was in trouble the day I received a pair of lace and beribboned earplugs along with a note saying I could use them to drown out the sound of her voice. The Beauty Queen had decided to fly out to California to "coordinate" my surgery. "We'll have such a good time," she said. I couldn't imagine having a blast when I was going to be flat on my back in a special "flap ward" for five days, but her enthusiasm was contagious. I almost began to look forward to the event.</p>
        <p>The day before I went to the hospital, Mother arrived bearing nightgowns, hair ornaments, moisturizers and the</p>
        <p>coup de main</p>
        <p>-- what every patient needs going into surgery -- a full-length mink coat, left to her by an elderly relative. "When this is all over, you'll come to New York and we'll go out on the town," Mom promised. Then she escorted me to a preoperative eyelash tint (since I'd be too weak to use mascara) and haircut.</p>
        <p>Waking up after seven hours of surgery, the first face I saw was Mother's. I knew she must have been worried sick because her hair was a mess. For days she sat by my bedside, adjusting my surgical stockings, untangling my hair, coaching me through breathing exercises to fill my lungs with air. When I was finally ambulatory, she helped me out of hospital garb into a dainty gown. Instantly, I felt better. Then she pulled out a bottle of Chanel polish. "Lie down," she ordered. "Let me do your toes."</p>
        <p>Now, when I look back (blessedly healthy and intact, with just a few fading scars) on what could have been a hideous ordeal, I remember Mother's secret beauty remedies with gratitude and indulgence. So when she called last week with a short list of au courant hairdressers, I dropped what I was doing and drove to Beverly Hills. The top scissors advised reshaping instead of cutting and, not surprisingly, did an excellent job.</p>
        <p>"When you come to New York, if you still want it short, I can take you to my people," Mother said.</p>
        <p>"Sounds like fun," I replied.</p>
