        <p>When night draws across the broken-faced tenements of the Hunts Point section of the Bronx, Freddie Cherokee Brown's teen-age eyes narrow and his boyish face hardens.</p>
        <p>On the dark and dangerous streets where Freddie regularly moves like a shadow, harm's hand beckons from nearly every turn. Crack fumes curl out of a grimy doorway. Prostitutes troll lonely street corners for easy customers and hard cash.</p>
        <p>For Freddie, these threats can usually be navigated with a knowing ease. But despite all the hubris he displays as he talks about "beating down" anyone who poses a danger to him, Freddie says he is unsettled by a larger, tougher, well-armed crew: the New York City Police Department. 'A Badge and a Gun'</p>
        <p>"Once they get a badge and a gun, they're the law," he said, in a hiss mixed of resignation and indignation. "They got all the authority in the world."</p>
        <p>To be young, male and black in a neighborhood so riddled with fear and the fearsome, Freddie says, is to grow up under the unblinking eyes of an occupying army in blue.</p>
        <p>"They really disgust me," he said in his typical rapid-fire tumble of words as he shouldered past two uniformed officers walking their beats along Hunts Point Avenue near the muffled whoosh of the Bruckner Expressway. "They cruise right behind you. You're looking at them, and they are looking at you. But if you look back at them, they want to get out of the car and search you and rough you up a little and throw you against the wall."</p>
        <p>Freddie's relationship with the police is, to say the least, very complicated. For Freddie, the constant presence of the police utterly unhinges him, and he certainly does not respect them. At the age of 17, he is two years into five years' probation for a felony conviction involving a stolen credit card. Still, he approaches the law and its enforcers with something of the self-destructive logic of the streets. One thing Freddie and his friends like to do is to call 911, then run away when the squad cars arrive.</p>
        <p>Freddie may be on probation, may be failing the 10th grade for the third time. But adults who know him say his arrest has pushed him to reform his life. He is concentrating so hard on the now that he has a hard time fixing on the future. In a barren apartment on a street bristling with criminality, he has become provider and protector to his 10-year-old brother and chronically out-of-work, widowed mother. He worries about them constantly. The money he contributes from his after-school job may well be the margin that keeps them alive.</p>
        <p>To Freddie, standing guard over his family, the Police Department's brand of justice is a commodity he cannot afford, a protection he cannot count on. Not only don't the police shield him and his family from crime, he says, they harass him and treat him as if he were the criminal.</p>
        <p>"Police, they rather bother with the small, petty stuff, things like running up on two kids arguing in the street and not stop somebody selling drugs," he said. "Police will go pass some prostitutes on the corner and harass some kids having a disagreement. It's because we're young."</p>
        <p>The beating of Rodney G. King, he added, only confirmed what he had long known: The police can be vicious, and they always stick together. "They are no better than us," he said. "Cops are just a little gang."</p>
        <p>Officer Robert E. Butler, who has been working in the local precinct, the 41st, for more than 20 years, says he knows many of the young faces of Hunts Point, "and I get along with them fairly well."</p>
        <p>"The kids are doing basically what they are supposed to be doing," he said, "and they have no problems with police." It is the youngster who plays too close to the line of illegality, he said, who draws the suspicion of the police.  Focal Point for Alienation</p>
        <p>But for young men like Freddie, in places like Hunts Point, the police become an easy focal point for all manner of alienation.</p>
        <p>"Some of the kids who are troubled by the police are real law-and-order types," said Paul Lipson, a worker at the Seneca Center, a youth center where Freddie has been a fixture the last two years. "They are angry at cops for harassing them, and they are disappointed in cops because they aren't aggressive enough in policing what they see as the real crime, activities that really bring down the quality of life for these kids' mothers, little brothers, grandparents."</p>
        <p>Freddie and the friends who make up his "Bitty Crew" -- named for its five members' "itty bitty" physical stature -- say one of their greatest pleasures is to corner a youngster they know, pull their hoods down over their faces and pelt him with punches. But they also consider themselves real law-and-order types: On their regular tours of the neighborhood, they chase away prostitutes and drug addicts, usually with shouts, sometimes with fists, rocks and bottles.</p>
        <p>"It's only like when somebody like a crackhead is smoking crack in the building, we say, 'What you doing? What you doing?,' " explained Freddie, who says he carries no weapons and has only experimented with marijuana. "If they said something smart, the first thing that comes to everybody's mind is 'Set it!' " a street call to attack.</p>
        <p>One day, Freddie saw a man snorting cocaine in plain view of a neighborhood woman who is known to be very religious. Freddie, who is generally warm and good natured, followed the man for 20 minutes. Eventually the man, with tears in his eyes, turned and cried for Freddie to leave him alone. The teen-ager walked away, his disgust tinged with satisfaction.</p>
        <p>If the man had snorted cocaine in front of Freddie's little brother, Amin Apache Taylor, Freddie said, he would not have let him off so easily. "I would have beat him down savagely," he said.  The Streets  Looking Out For One Another</p>
        <p>Not long ago, Mr. Lipson was outside the Seneca Center on Seneca and Lafayette Avenues, paying some of the black teen-agers who work there. "An officer came up to me and said, 'Is everything all right, sir?' " Mr. Lipson recalled. "He figured I was being mugged by two black guys."</p>
        <p>For Mr. Lipson, who is white, the incident was just one more illustration of the way the police simply assume the worst about black and Hispanic teen-agers.</p>
        <p>Freddie does not deny that race has something to do with the way the police treat him and his crew. But he insists that the relationship is defined more by the fact that the police, white and black, are adults leery and afraid of youngsters -- particularly those on streets as mean as the ones in Hunts Point.</p>
        <p>"I get in trouble for being in the wrong place at the wrong time," said Freddie, adding that he has no animosity toward whites. "It's not my fault I be living in Hunts Point."</p>
        <p>At his mother's insistence, Freddie has formulated some rules of disengagement from the police. He tries to spend as much time as he can in school, in an after-school program, at his job at the Seneca Center and in an orbit of late-night Laundromats, Chinese take-out restaurants and video arcades.</p>
        <p>Inevitably, though, he finds himself out on the streets where he has spent most of his life. Out on those streets, the Bitty Crew, formed more than a year ago, is his defense against boredom and danger. "We look out for each other," Freddie explained. "For each one of us, we are our own police. For me, if I get in trouble, I'm not calling 911." Instead, he will call his crew.  Mischief and Danger</p>
        <p>In the South Bronx, childish mischief often comes with a strong helping of danger.</p>
        <p>After the first big snowfall of the winter, Freddie and his friends took to the rooftops and zeroed in on the heads that passed below.</p>
        <p>"We were throwing snowballs, and then somebody called the cops on us," Freddie recalled. "So then we all started throwing snowballs at the cops."</p>
        <p>When the police went up to the roof, he said, he and his friends skipped from building to building until they escaped.</p>
        <p>"It's not like we were doing it to be bad," Freddie said. "It's just that Hunts Point is boring."</p>
        <p>Doing such things could "blow probation, blow the program, blow everything that he has accumulated," said Paul B. Dudley, a caseworker who has worked with Freddie. But, he added, "A lot of the kids say to themselves, from time to time, that they are in a hopeless situation."</p>
        <p>Violence, either using it or observing it, seems to dominate Freddie's world. When he and the crew talk about going to the big multiplex cinema up in Whitestone, they shun almost all but what Freddie calls "destructive movies," the ones with titles like "Sniper" and "Dead-Alive."</p>
        <p>Surrounded by so much violence, Freddie is basically a stoic. He has an understanding with his mother, he explains, that if she does not hear from him in 24 hours, he is either dead or in jail. The Family  'Being the Man Of the House'</p>
        <p>Freddie was born in the Bronx -- he does not know the hospital -- and he lived his first years with his mother, Deborah Taylor, and his great-grandmother in a apartment just north of Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>By the time he was 6, his mother had moved the family out of the Bronx and in with his father, Freddie Brown, at a shelter on Staten Island. Three years later, the family moved to Hunts Point, and it was there, when Freddie was 16, that his father died.</p>
        <p>Freddie's mother says her husband, a construction worker, died of internal bleeding from an injury suffered on the job. But Freddie blames himself.</p>
        <p>For years, his father had been shuttling in an out of the family's life, and whenever he returned, father and son would tangle over control of the house. "I was used to being the man of the house," Freddie says. "When he came back, he tried to take over." Sometimes, Freddie would end up running away, and he is sure his father died of pneumonia, caught chasing him out into the streets.</p>
        <p>Sometimes now, Freddie says, he rides the ferry back to Staten Island.</p>
        <p>"I just ride there and back," he says of his flights from the South Bronx. "It's peaceful."</p>
        <p>It was about two years ago when Freddie, while with a friend in Manhattan, suffered what he regards as his gravest injustice at the hands of the police. Since he is considered a youthful offender, records regarding the incident are closed and officials refuse to discuss the case. But Freddie gave this account:</p>
        <p>Dressed in his usual street gear of an outsized black vinyl field jacket, a black hooded sweatshirt, a baseball cap, baggy slacks, and $100 Timberland work boots, he recalled, he found a credit card in a discarded wallet on the street. Eyeing the card as he walked to the subway to return home, he was stopped by a police officer who believed, despite his protests, that he had stolen it.</p>
        <p>"I was going to show it to my mother and tell my mother, 'Look what I found.' " Freddie said. "Anything I find I show my mother."</p>
        <p>Freddie recalled that there was a scuffle and he found himself arrested and charged with robbery. Unable to reach his mother, who has no telephone, he spent two nights "with all these men" in the Tombs.</p>
        <p>On his lawyer's advice, Freddie, who had no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to avoid even the slightest possibility of prison, he said. Tales of prisoner slashings and rapes terrify him.</p>
        <p>"If he told me to take 20 years of probation or go to jail, I would take the 20 years probation," Freddie explained. "Rikers Island? I ain't going out like that."</p>
        <p>There is another reason, Freddie says, why he could not go to prison: his family. Since his father's death, he has truly been the man of the house. Much has been placed on his shoulders. Without the pay from his job chopping wood at the Seneca Center -- as much as $200 in a good week, he says -- his mother could not pay her household expenses.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Taylor, a slender 38-year-old woman who seldom strays far from home, says she would like to find a job, but she is a high-school dropout and has few skills. Her rent is entirely subsidized, but her monthly income is only $187 in Social Security and $100 in food stamps. The apartment, two rooms for three people, is neat because it has almost nothing in it. When burglars broke into the apartment recently, the only thing taken was a Nintendo game; the two old televisions were left behind.</p>
        <p>Freddie's mother says she prays for him.</p>
        <p>"If anything is going to change it's probably going to be because of him. We always said he was the One," she said, recalling that Freddie had started speaking as clearly as an adult at the age of 1. "We knew he was going to be special."</p>
        <p>But one dream at a time. Sitting in her bare bedroom (really the living room) with its flimsy curtain of a door, she said she wanted to get her family into a housing project. "We're on a waiting list," she said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Freddie says he would like to be "any kind of lawyer or a rapper or an accountant or something." His mind is nimble and sharp; he is as comfortable with the computers at Seneca as with the video games at a midtown arcade. But when he talks about his ambitions, his eyes blink back the uncertainties, and he declares that he will just do what he plans to do. "By the time I get off probation," he says, "I'll be in college."</p>
        <p>But he still must finish high school. Right now, he says, that might mean leaving Adlai E. Stevenson High School, where he is in danger of being left back yet again, and enrolling in an alternative high school. School, he says, is simply not challenging enough for him.</p>
        <p>Freddie says he tries not to let his probation shake him; he regularly reports to his probation officer. "I don't plan to get into any more trouble," he said. "It'll go fast." A Grisly Discovery</p>
        <p>On one of their occasional jogs through the neighborhood recently, Freddie and a friend made a grisly discovery: the mangled body of a prostitute.</p>
        <p>Freddie and his friend appeared unmoved, but deeply fascinated.</p>
        <p>"Somebody threw her off the bridge," Freddie said, to anyone who would listen. He said seeing death, even raw and up close, did not bother him.</p>
        <p>"She wasn't mutilated," he said. "It's just part of life around here."</p>
        <p>Then Freddie flagged down a police officer; it was his civic duty, he said. But he did not hang around when they began arriving to investigate.</p>
        <p>Flashing the broadest of grins, he added, "They might start asking me where I was the night of . . . "</p>
