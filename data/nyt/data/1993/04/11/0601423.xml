        <p>The following text was taken from more than 20 hours of discussions with teen-agers from the New York City region. Excerpts appear with each article.</p>
        <p>Q Do you feel you have to dress a certain way so you won't be harassed?</p>
        <p>ZAIRE GRAHAM, 17, Bronx (High School of Fashion Industries): You just have to pick where you wear your clothes to. Sometimes, you know, you just have to be aware. And you've got to know the crowd. So I'm not going to wear the biggest jewelry I have. I'm not going to wear the biggest earrings I have.  You don't walk . . . between a group of hoodlums that you know that act stupid in that particular area with a butter-soft leather coat.</p>
        <p>EMMA KRAMER-WHEELER, 16, Brooklyn (Edward R. Murrow High School): You have to be so aware of what's around you all the time. And if you're not, you know, you're putting yourself in danger. I mean in this city you have to trust your instincts, 'cause if you don't trust your instincts what are you going to trust?</p>
        <p>JUAN RIVERA, 18, Brooklyn (Bushwick High School): Right, sometimes your instincts say, 'Well, I have to go through this crowd 'cause if they see me cross the street . . . "</p>
        <p>Q</p>
        <p>Then they'll think you're soft?</p>
        <p>JUAN Right. Then they know, you know. So sometimes you have to walk through.</p>
        <p>Q What do you do to be careful?</p>
        <p>JUAN It's like riding on the train. You might be riding on the train and you might be in one car. There might be a few people getting in the car that you know they might harm you or something like that. You have to walk away, but the right way. You know, 'cause if you try to run away . . . they'll try to attack you.</p>
        <p>BERNARDO VASQUEZ, 17, Manhattan (A. Philip Randolph High School): You know, one thing is that when I'm on a train by myself, I walk on the train like I'm about to kill somebody. . . . 'Cause I've done a lot of people on the train, so I know they're going to do something on the train, too.</p>
        <p>Q When you said you used to do things on the train, what do you mean?</p>
        <p>BERNARDO Mischievous things like take Walkmans from kids and stuff like that.</p>
        <p>Q Has anybody here ever had a gun?</p>
        <p>JUAN I fired a gun before. There was a lot of people on my block, all right. . . . And things started getting rowdy, and one of my friends had a gun. So he was like, 'Yo, I'm going to shoot somebody, I'm going to shoot somebody.' I was like, 'No. All you have to do is just shoot it in the air . . . and everything will stop.' . . . So I was like, 'Give me the gun, give me the gun.' I took a shot up in the air and everything, you know, just stopped.</p>
        <p>ZAIRE That works every time. . . . The streets are scary 'cause a gun is real easy to get. . . .  Like girls tend to have a little one, like 22's and everything. . . . It scares me in a way because nobody wants to fight anymore. It's not, you know, we go blow for blow. Now it's "I'll shoot you and get it over with."</p>
        <p>Q</p>
        <p>How much does a gun cost?</p>
        <p>BERNARDO: The ones that police carry, a 9 millimeter, they run in the stores for $500, $600. It depends on how many drug dealers traded the gun. You know, the value lowers the more drug people use it, you know? Or more people use it. I figure that a first-hand used gun would probably cost on the street $200, $150.</p>
        <p>Q Do you think some of this talk about young people and guns is exaggerated?</p>
        <p>ZAIRE You've got to look at how many young people is killing young people. So it's not like it's even being dramatized or exaggerated or anything because we're stabbing each other, we're killing each other, we're dying every day.</p>
