        <p>Long Island isn't just the Hamptons, the Expressway, the Gold Coast or even Walt Whitman; it's also nature preserves, robber-baron estates and museums, including ones that specialize in the backbone of the region: fishing, boating and whaling. These small museums are worth the drive (or train ride) for a visit during the spring school break. Cold Spring Harbor Whaling Museum</p>
        <p>Main Street, at Turkey Lane  Cold Spring Harbor  (516) 367-3418  Recommended for all ages  Tuesdays through Sundays</p>
        <p>This museum is a testament to the years 1836-62, when Cold Spring Harbor was an important whaling port, supporting nine vessels in their seemingly endless search for blubber. The four galleries offer interactive displays, games and exhibitions that entice children into the world of whales.</p>
        <p>In one exhibit, you can push a button and hear the taped sounds of humpback whales. In another, you can touch whale bones and study scrimshaw. The history of whaling unfolds in dioramas and displays, and the facts are presented in ways that are meaningful to children: a killer whale, for example, is compared to a school bus in length (30 feet).</p>
        <p>In the center of the museum is a 100-year-old whale boat with original equipment, part of a ship called the Daisy that sailed from New Bedford, Mass. There is also a sea-blue activity room where children can work on art projects and puzzles. The museum is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M. After Memorial Day, it will be open Mondays as well. Admission is $1; $2 for adults; $1.50 for the elderly.  Suffolk Marine Museum</p>
        <p>Montauk Highway, at West Avenue  West Sayville  (516) 854-4974  Recommended for all ages  Wednesdays through Sundays</p>
        <p>The front lawn of this museum, on the bucolic grounds of a former estate, ends at the Great South Bay, with a full view of Fire Island. Its briny atmosphere is well suited to the museum's focus on Long Island maritime history, particularly as it evolved on the South Shore.</p>
        <p>There are boat models, antique lifesaving equipment, paintings and photographs of shipwrecks and other memorabilia. Children will be drawn to the model of the Sovereign of the Sea, a boat built by King Charles I of England in 1637. The Sovereign carried 800 men and 104 guns (miniature cannons protrude from the model) and sailed for 60 years, until a burning candle set her afire.</p>
        <p>Other models (all are in glass cases) are of the types of boats that sail local waters, like a yawl, small and large yachts, a sloop and a tugboat. The real thing, a tugboat circa 1870, is moored right outside.</p>
        <p>The museum is open Wednesday through Saturday, 10 A.M. to 3 P.M., and Sunday, noon to 4 P.M. Admission is free until June 1; from June 1 through Labor Day, adults are charged $2 (children under 12 are still admitted free).  Nassau County Police Museum</p>
        <p>Police Headquarters  1490 Franklin Avenue, at 15th Street  Mineola  (516) 573-7000  Recommended ages: 5 and up  Mondays through Fridays</p>
        <p>For children enamored of the good-guys-versus-bad-guys theme, this museum offers plenty of authentic police paraphernalia to contemplate.</p>
        <p>At the entrance, there's a car grille with a license plate dated 1925, the year the Nassau County Police Department was established. Adding extra seriousness is a cartridge-filled gun belt hanging on a coat rack; a fingerprint-taking machine (the Ryan dactyloplane, patented in 1916); a camera with a large flash, reminiscent of Sergeant Friday and the "Dragnet" series, and a black-and-white photograph of Bonnie Parker at 24, with guns dangling from her slim waist.</p>
        <p>The museum, which is free, keeps erratic weekday hours, so it is best to call ahead. Next week, it will be open Monday through Friday from 11:30 A.M. to 7:30 P.M.</p>
