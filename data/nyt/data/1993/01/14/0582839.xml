        <p>In "Toys That Teach," an exhibition of 17 wooden toys in geometric shapes at the Canadian Center for Architecture in Montreal, visitors can see ghosts of long-ago childhoods and a source of Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural creativity.</p>
        <p>There is a set of thin wood rods and round corks, a precursor of Tinkertoys. There are triangles, rectangles and cylinders from the early 19th century. And what are Legos but geometric shapes?</p>
        <p>Six toys in the show were designed by Friedrich Frobel, who came up with the idea for kindergartens in Germany in 1830 and designed his own toys that teach. It was Frobel's building blocks that inspired Frank Lloyd Wright to become an architect.</p>
        <p>"Wright, the architectural egomaniac of all times, was very insistent that he learned architecture not from other buildings, but from the blocks," said Dr. Michael L. Lewis, the curator of the show.</p>
        <p>When Frobel's ideas and toys came to the United States, the wooden blocks were produced by manufacturers like Milton Bradley in East Longmeadow, Mass., and later, J. L. Hammett of Boston.</p>
        <p>W. W. Ross, a 19th-century Superintendent of Schools in Fremont, Ohio, designed an original toy, a set of Ross Mensuration Blocks, which were used to calculate surface area and volume.</p>
        <p>For the Montreal show, Dr. Lewis said, the toys have been placed on clear plastic platforms and lighted so that the base disappears, shadows are projected onto the walls, and the objects seem to float. "The audience is primarily adults," he said. But to lure children to the exhibition on weekends, the museum has sessions in which they can play with some of the toys, or variations of them.</p>
        <p>"Toys That Teach" runs through April 25. The Canadian Center for Architecture is situated at 1920 rue Baile. Information: (514) 939-7000.</p>
