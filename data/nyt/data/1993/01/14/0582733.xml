        <p>The Treasury Department disclosed today a broad revision of the nation's tax regulations for foreign companies, but it was unclear what effect, if any, the changes would have on tax revenue.</p>
        <p>The revision aims to clarify existing regulations rather than enact sweeping changes. Though the Bush Administration would like to increase tax collections from foreign companies, Administration officials say huge increases are not feasible.

        <p>The Treasury Department disclosed today a broad revision of the nation's tax regulations for foreign companies, but it was unclear what effect, if any, the changes would have on tax revenue.</p>
        <p>The revision aims to clarify existing regulations rather than enact sweeping changes. Though the Bush Administration would like to increase tax collections from foreign companies, Administration officials say huge increases are not feasible. President-elect Bill Clinton said during the campaign that billions of dollars could be raised through increased taxes on foreign businesses.</p>
        <p>The new rules, contained in documents nearly an inch thick, will take effect in 90 days, allowing a little time for the Clinton Administration to review and possibly change them.</p>
        <p>The Treasury Department does not estimate revenues from new regulations, and did not do so today. Enforcement Is Crucial</p>
        <p>George N. Carlson, a tax partner in the Washington office of Arthur Andersen &amp; Company, one of the first private tax experts to read the new regulations, said that the effect of the new rules on tax revenues and the budget deficit, and the indirect effect on Mr. Clinton's economic proposals, would depend entirely on how the Clinton Administration chose to enforce the new rules.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's economic proposals during the campaign rely in part on raising an extra $45 billion over the next four years through the tougher enforcement of tax regulations on foreign companies doing business in the United States. The same plan proposed to collect $91.7 billion from wealthy individuals and a total of $58.3 billion by closing corporate loopholes, including the higher tax collections from foreign companies.</p>
        <p>Treasury officials have expressed skepticism about Mr. Clinton's forecasts of extra revenues.</p>
        <p>"There is a general consensus in the tax community that those figures are greatly exaggerated," a senior Treasury official said today. But the official, who insisted on anonymity, said that he and his colleagues had not studied the revenue effects of today's revision. Regulations Spur Complaints</p>
        <p>The Treasury Department issued a draft of today's regulations a year ago, and that draft prompted complaints from the European Community and the Japanese Government that the rules might discriminate against their companies. Mr. Carlson said that the final rules issued today appeared to represent "a step back" from a few of the more drastic changes previously envisioned.</p>
        <p>The new rules will also affect the extent to which American multinational corporations pay taxes in the United States or overseas.</p>
        <p>The rules released today represent the first comprehensive revision since 1968 of regulations that govern how much of an international company's profits are taxed by the United States and how much are taxed by foreign countries.</p>
        <p>The 1968 regulations assumed that most international companies were manufacturers that traded goods with easily measured costs and prices, the senior Treasury official said. The rules have become increasingly outdated as service companies have taken greater roles in the American economy, the official said.</p>
        <p>Because state governments typically base their tax bills on corporations' Federal tax liability, additional Federal revenues would likely result in more money for the states.</p>
        <p>Estimates of the potential extra revenues have ranged wildly. Shirley Peterson, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, said last April that an additional $3 billion annually could be raised through new regulations and better administration. But the Democrat-controlled House Ways and Means Committee has estimated that up to $30 billion annually could be available to the Federal Government.</p>
