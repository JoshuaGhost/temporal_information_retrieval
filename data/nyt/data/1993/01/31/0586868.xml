        <p>Walter Payton, the National Football League's career rushing leader, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame today. So were Chuck Noll and Bill Walsh, the coaches with more Super Bowl victories than any others; Dan Fouts, a marvelous passing quarterback for 15 years, and Larry Little, a prototype offensive guard for 14 seasons.</p>
        <p>In voting by a panel of 34 pro football writers, the only finalists not elected were tight end Jackie Smith from the regular category and offensive guard Dick Stanfel from the seniors category. Smith will become one of the final 14 nominees (plus one senior) next year. The five who were elected will be inducted this summer at the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.</p>

        <p>Walter Payton, the National Football League's career rushing leader, was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame today. So were Chuck Noll and Bill Walsh, the coaches with more Super Bowl victories than any others; Dan Fouts, a marvelous passing quarterback for 15 years, and Larry Little, a prototype offensive guard for 14 seasons.</p>
        <p>In voting by a panel of 34 pro football writers, the only finalists not elected were tight end Jackie Smith from the regular category and offensive guard Dick Stanfel from the seniors category. Smith will become one of the final 14 nominees (plus one senior) next year. The five who were elected will be inducted this summer at the Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.</p>
        <p>Eight players were eliminated in earlier voting today: wide receivers Lynn Swann and Charlie Joiner, tight end Kellen Winslow, offensive tackle Bob Brown, offensive guard Tom Mack, center Dwight Stephenson, defensive end Carl Eller and cornerback Mel Renfro. As usual, vote totals were not disclosed. A Smallish Bear</p>
        <p>Payton spent his 13 pro seasons (1975-87) with the Chicago Bears. At age 38, he is a businessman and one of five partners trying to get a National Football League expansion franchise for St. Louis.</p>
        <p>Payton's sweet running style earned him the nickname of Sweetness. He holds eight N.F.L. career records, including rushing yards (16,726), combined rushing and passing yards (21,803) and rushing touchdowns (110). He had 10 seasons as a 1,000-yard rusher, nine as a Pro Bowl player, seven as an All-Pro and five straight as the league's rushing leader. In 1977, he set an N.F.L. one-game rushing record of 275 yards.</p>
        <p>Payton seemed almost embarrassed by his election.</p>
        <p>"I look at guys in the Hall of Fame, and many were tremendous athletes I looked up to," he said by telephone from Chicago. "That's what greatness is all about. And then you find yourself there. I didn't go into football to get to the Hall of Fame. I went to play a game I loved and got paid for playing, and I did the best I could." Four Super Bowl Rings</p>
        <p>Noll, 60, is the only coach to have won four Super Bowls, and he won them all with the Pittsburgh Steelers between 1975 and 1980. He retired a year ago after 39 training camps -- seven (1953-59) as an offensive guard for Cleveland, nine (1960-68) as an N.F.L. assistant coach and 23 (1969-91) as the Steelers' head coach.</p>
        <p>His Steelers teams posted a 193-148-1 record and won 11 division titles. They produced the Hall of Fame players Franco Harris, Terry Bradshaw, Mel Blount, Joe Greene, Jack Lambert and Jack Ham.</p>
        <p>"It's a thrill," Noll said of his election. "You never know how these things are going to go. My feelings run deep. When you're involved in a team sport, it's a thing you want to share with everybody."</p>
        <p>One "everybody" was Greene, Noll's former defensive tackle, who attended Noll's news conference here.</p>
        <p>"He's the best," Greene said. "It's a proud thing for me. I was there all the times he wasn't voted coach of the year when he should have been."</p>
        <p>While Noll's specialty was defense, Walsh's has been offense. He made the San Francisco 49ers the team of the 1980's, winning three Super Bowls and six division titles in his 10 seasons (1979-88) as their head coach. As an N.F.L. assistant and head coach, he helped develop such quarterbacks as Kenny Anderson, Fouts and Joe Montana. Now, at age 61, he is the head coach at Stanford.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Walsh called his election "the ultimate individual satisfaction."</p>
        <p>"I really didn't expect it, although I hoped some day I would make it," he said. "I felt as long as I coached, people would think that at age 72 or something I would go back to the N.F.L. I'm sure I wouldn't." Air Fouts</p>
        <p>In high school, Fouts could not even make his all-league team. In 15 seasons (1973-87) in the N.F.L., under such coaches as Don Coryell and Walsh, he played 181 games for the San Diego Chargers. His career totals included 43,040 yards passing, 254 touchdown passes, six 400-yard games, six Pro Bowls and three All-Pro selections. Now he is 41 and a game analyst for CBS television.</p>
        <p>"This is an overwhelming feeling," he said. "I'm most proud to have been associated with a style of play -- Air Coryell. We were on the cutting edge of offensive football and the passing game."</p>
        <p>The 47-year-old Little played two seasons (1967-68) with the Chargers and 12 (1969-80) with the Miami Dolphins. He was an All-Pro six straight seasons and a Pro Bowl player four straight.</p>
        <p>"I'm very happy, ecstatic," he said from Las Vegas, Nev. "I'm ready to go out the window. I tried to the best I could in a team concept, and individual awards are gravy. Being only the third guard to go into the Hall of Fame, behind John Hannah and Gene Upshaw, that's a big thrill. I'm almost at a loss for words."  PRO FOOTBALL</p>
