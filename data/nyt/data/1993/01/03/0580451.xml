        <p>The traditional but nonetheless specious distinction between mind and brain has spawned an equally false dichotomy between psychotherapy and psychiatric medications ("Off the Couch," by Elizabeth Stone, Dec. 6). According to this flawed view, only medications redress the chemical imbalances that cause behavioral, cognitive or emotional problems. The biochemical disturbances associated with mental illness, presumably, are untouched by the various forms of "talk" therapy.</p>
        <p>However, recent discoveries in neuroscience have started to reveal the neuroanatomical and chemical changes that learning produces. The stunning implication is that, once inside the brain, words and medications are substantively equivalent.</p>
