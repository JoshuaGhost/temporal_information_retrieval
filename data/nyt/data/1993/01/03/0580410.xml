        <p>To the Editor: Your article on banning smoking on airplanes is right on point. My question for the airlines is, why wait until 1996? Why does anyone need government or International Civil Aviation Organization approval or "technical safety studies" to ban smoking? Any airline wishing to ban smoking on its international flights could do so tomorrow. It would merely have to publicize the fact, impose the rule and make provisions for any diehard smokers who held nonrefundable tickets.</p>
        <p>I am a frequent international traveler who spends a lot of time in airplanes, mostly on long international flights. I spend $50,000 to $70,000 per year on airplane tickets to foreign destinations. I find smoking and the requirement that I breathe recycled, smoke-contaminated air to be obnoxious at best and dangerous at worst.</p>

        <p>I would gladly give all my international business, within routing limitations, to whichever United States airline would ban smoking on all international flights. I am sure there are many thousands of others with similar feelings. BERIL J. LAPSON New York, N.Y.</p>
