        <p>THE wind was swirling around a park rink in Carlstadt, and the temperature hovered in the 20's, but the Glen Rock Lightnings and the Carlstadt Flames were about to scrimmage.

        <p>THE wind was swirling around a park rink in Carlstadt, and the temperature hovered in the 20's, but the Glen Rock Lightnings and the Carlstadt Flames were about to scrimmage. Out from duffel bags came the gear: the knee, elbow and shin pads, the padded gloves and the helmets. Then the teams lined up, an air horn sounded and play began with the face-off.</p>
        <p>But this was hockey with a difference: the players were wearing not ice skates but in-line roller skates; the puck was a hard rubber ball, and the rink was made of macadam, not ice.</p>
        <p>The two teams, along with squads from Paramus, Little Ferry-Moonachie, Hawthorne, Ridgewood and Oakland, are members of the recently formed North Jersey Roller Hockey Association, the first roller hockey league for young people in the state -- and only the third in the nation.</p>
        <p>The 400 skaters are divided into three age groups, midgets (fifth and sixth grades), juniors (seventh and eighth grades) and seniors (up to age 18). Their first season will officially begin on Saturday.  No Checking Allowed</p>
        <p>Junior roller hockey follows the rules of the National Hockey League with one major exception. In the interests of safety, there is no checking, or using the body or a stick to block an opponent.</p>
        <p>As to the skills needed, Kevin Mathe, 17, center on the Carlstadt senior team, who recently switched from playing ice hockey to roller hockey, said: "Because macadam is a slower surface than ice, it requires better stick-handling skills. You want to have longer possession of the ball to allow your teammates to get into position for a pass."</p>
        <p>Adult roller hockey leagues have proliferated with the growing popularity of skates on which the wheels are in a single line, allowing for intricate movements like those of ice skaters. Then a number of determined young in-line skaters in these towns cajoled their parents to help set up organized competition.</p>
        <p>"It was the kids who cranked up the sport," said Jeff Mays of Glen Rock, the president of the new league. Mr. Mays sent letters to local recreation officials seeking interest in the proposed league.</p>
        <p>Carlstadt, under the aegis of Ron Perrotta, had already organized the team and was eager for competition. Mr. Perrotta, a father who is now vice president of the intertown league, had already etablished a roller hockey program in Carlstadt.</p>
        <p>"These kids would be playing ice hockey if they lived in a suburb of a place like Minneapolis, where it is cold enough for outdoor rinks," said Richard Knapp, who heads the Glen Rock roller hockey group. "But this is the next best thing to simulate the sport." Building New Rinks</p>
        <p>Expense is another factor. "Very few kids can afford to be involved with an ice hockey team," said Peter Molyneux, a member of the Paramus Recreation Commission and a proponent of the new league. And, he added, "getting time on your own on ice is scheduled mainly at times almost impossible to fit into a family's schedule."</p>
        <p>The new league is finding alternatives to hockey rinks. In Paramus last weekend, a new roller rink was dedicated on the grounds of the high school. Two days later, a group of Glen Rock fathers, having put in more than 300 hours of labor, completed a rink in the community's pool parking lot.</p>
        <p>The Little Ferry roller hockey team plays part of its season on a $500,000 outdoor hockey rink. Mayor Louis Tedesco Jr. explained that in exchange for Little Ferry's prohibiting development in the bucolic 14-acre Losen Slote Creek Park, the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission built the hockey rink for the borough.</p>
        <p>For six weeks in the winter, it is flooded for ice hockey; the rest of the time it is used for roller hockey and recreational roller skating.</p>
        <p>In Glen Rock, the roller hockey team had its beginning in 1987 in Marilyn Leonard's basement on Harristown Road. The carpet was rolled back, and her son, Christopher, now an eighth grader, invited his third-grade friends to play hockey on roller skates. All around were signs that read, "Go Devils."</p>
        <p>Then in-line skates were developed as an off-season training tool for ice hockey players, and the new skates caught on fast with the Glen Rock youngsters. Soon they had moved out of the basement and onto the outdoor basketball courts at the Coleman grammar school, where players' jackets doubled as goalies' nets. 'Try to Find a Game'</p>
        <p>Their parents thought something better could be arranged and persuaded town officials to designate the town tennis courts as a roller hockey rink. The skaters toted their equipment there and became familiar figures on the streets of Glen Rock, gliding along on their skates toward their new rink, pushing before them a shopping cart that carried their paraphernalia -- including regulation goal nets.</p>
        <p>In Carlstadt, 13-year-old Billy MacKeigan recalled: "We'd haul our equipment around and try to find a game. We'd go to the park, throw our sticks on the ground, and the ones that were pulled out became the two captains and the goalies."</p>
        <p>At first even their protective gear was limited, but as the sport became organized, the players heeded the "Skate smart" safety campaign of Rollerblade Inc., the manufacturer of the skates. Helmets costing $60 were required, as were elbow and knee pads at $40, and $15 shin pads. The skates range around $200, and the jerseys cost $25.</p>
        <p>Last summer, by the first week in July, Andrew Knapp, 14, the goalie on the Glen Rock junior team, had cut enough lawns to pay for the $90 gloves, made with padding to protect the thumb area yet thin enough in the palms to sensitize his feel of the hockey stick. His goalie pads sent his equipment up another $150.</p>
        <p>"Roller skates have become passe, and in-line skates have moved quickly off the shelves," said Michael Christenberry, the manager of the Princeton Ski Shop in Clifton. The three-store Princeton Ski Shop chain has sold more than 10,000 pairs of single-line skates this year.</p>
        <p>"Given the amount of wear and tear, for roller hockey we suggest a skate with a thicker shell and lining and wider, flatter wheels, giving more stability than speed," he said. "The longer wheel base allows for better support in the in-line than in the traditional side-by-side roller skates."</p>
        <p>Last April, the local roller hockey parents held their first meeting. "Most of us had been on some athletic board," Mr. Mays said, "so when it came time to write up the bylaws and constitution, we tried to incorporate the rules that function best in the leagues we were familiar with. In this league, everyone makes the playoffs." Emulating Their Idols</p>
        <p>Jenn Perrotta, 13, of Carlstadt is one of the few girls in the league. Her male teammates praised her skill as a center.</p>
        <p>Each team in the league has a head coach with several assistants. In Glen Rock, Jeff Horn, an audio-visual instructor at the high school, who over the years has taught local youngsters how to play hockey, was named head coach.</p>
        <p>For Bob St. Clair, the coach of the Little Ferry-Moonachie team and a skilled hockey player himself, there is only one sport -- hockey. "In-line skating allows these kids to emulate their idols in the N.H.L.," he said.</p>
        <p>Jean Bertholf of Oakland, a vice president of the North Jersey Roller Hockey Association, cheers on two of her three sons on the town's roller hockey team. Her husband, John, who has been involved in hockey for 35 years, having played it on roller skates on rinks in Brooklyn, said: "As coaches, we all insist on safety check of equipment, even the mouthpiece. The way hockey is played in this league, it is less physically wearing than football."</p>
        <p>Paul Rizzo Jr., who is in charge of referees for the association, assigns two officials to each game. At a recent scrimmage, at which he was the referee, he skated in and out of the action, darting about, keeping an eye out for any infractions.</p>
        <p>At the end of the first period, Mr. Rizzo paused. Looking over the young players, he said, "Getting an organized roller hockey league has been a long time in coming." Grinning, he added, "These kids are really the pioneers of the sport."</p>
