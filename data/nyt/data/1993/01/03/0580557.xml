        <p>Last month, St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan planned, then abruptly canceled, its annual observance of World AIDS Day. Hospital administrators rejected most of the educational material to be handed out in the lobby, saying it promoted the use of condoms and referred to acts that "were not in keeping with the teachings of the Catholic Church."</p>
        <p>The clamp-down baffled the hospital's AIDS workers, who said that the same brochures and pamphlets had been allowed in previous years. In defiance, a few of them took to the sidewalk to give the prevention literature to passers-by.</p>
        <p>It was a relatively minor, and rare, public display of protest at a Catholic-run institution. But it offered a glimpse into a tug-of-war between the Roman Catholic Church, a major provider of medical care and other services for people with H.I.V., and the public health establishment over how to prevent new infections.</p>
        <p>In places like New York, which leads the country in reported AIDS cases, Catholic institutions, with heavy financial support from the Government, have been major providers of care to AIDS patients.  Clash of Values</p>
        <p>But citing its moral imperatives, the church has resisted teaching prevention messages widely recommended by public health officials, like the use of condoms or instructions on cleaning hypodermic needles used for intravenous drugs. Church officials say that the only morally correct way to prevent AIDS is by avoiding drugs and by practicing fidelity within marriage and abstinence outside it.</p>
        <p>Both John Cardinal O'Connor, head of the Archdiocese of New York, and his director of health and hospitals declined to be interviewed, but his spokesman, Joseph G. Zwilling, said that even with the constraints on what information hospitals provide, he is confident of the treatment they offer.</p>
        <p>"We believe we provide excellent care for our patients," he said.</p>
        <p>How patients are affected by the restrictions varies from hospital to hospital and from worker to worker. Some workers ignore the church teachings, keeping condoms hidden in their desks and counseling H.I.V.-infected pregnant women, who could pass the virus to their babies, about the option of abortion. They say they are able to do this because there is little monitoring or interference from the church.</p>
        <p>But some advocates for people with AIDS say that public health officials have not done enough to insure that uniform medical practices are followed in the Catholic institutions. Indeed, at times state and city regulations have been relaxed to conform with the church's teachings.</p>
        <p>Public health officials, however, say they find themselves in something of a quandary over how far to push the hospitals to provide prevention information. The Catholic institutions were among the first to show compassion for AIDS patients, quickly responding to their needs, from pastoral to hospice care. In New York, for instance, Catholic institutions provide 36 percent of nursing-home care for AIDS patients. Conditional Praise for Church's Care</p>
        <p>Three Catholic hospitals designated by the state as AIDS centers -- St. Vincent's, St. Clare's and Cabrini, all in Manhattan -- account for 10 percent of the state's AIDS-related admissions, New York State Department of Health figures show. For some of the hospitals AIDS was a financial boon, filling up their beds and attracting government money to add or upgrade services.</p>
        <p>"On the one hand, there is no realistic substitute for the care that has been provided by these Catholic providers," said Nicholas A. Rango, director of the state Health Department's AIDS Institute. "On the other hand, the position articulated by some, but not all, Catholic authorities has resulted in an unacceptably narrow AIDS prevention message."</p>
        <p>The friction has been most severe in New York City, where the Catholic leadership is among the most conservative in the country. Cardinal O'Connor, a spokesman for traditionalists, heads the Archdiocese of New York, which covers Manhattan, Staten Island and the Bronx and seven other counties north of New York City.</p>
        <p>At the same time, inside the Catholic hospitals, the medical-moral clash has forced many public health professionals to operate like underground guerrillas. Some workers at Catholic hospitals say they often have to watch their words, not document the counseling they give in medical charts or risk being reported to supervisors if the patient takes exception to it.</p>
        <p>Some do not dare utter the word "condom" inside the institution.</p>
        <p>"We call it the C-word," one doctor at St. Vincent's said.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this predicament more evident than at St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village, situated in an area with one of the highest rates of H.I.V. infection in the country. The hospital, co-owned by the Sisters of Charity and the Archdiocese of New York, last year had 2,267 AIDS-related admissions and served another 1,400 patients in its outpatient clinic.</p>
        <p>St. Vincent's official policy is that the staff cannot counsel patients on condoms, abortion or how to clean hypodermic needles for drug use, or refer them out for such counseling, said Joseph Savage, a hospital spokesman. But some AIDS workers say they disregard that policy.</p>
        <p>"I believe in essence that you have to do what you have to do for the health of the patient," said one doctor who, like others interviewed at St. Vincent's and other Catholic hospitals, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of endangering his job.</p>
        <p>"If I'm doing this it is not because I feel that people should avoid pregnancies or because I believe in homosexuality," he said, "but because I want to prevent infections with the virus."</p>
        <p>Many H.I.V.-infected patients, this doctor and other hospital workers say, continue to have an active sex life, and some still use drugs. They say that not discussing all the alternatives available to avoid getting re-infected with different strains of the virus or infecting others would be tantamount to malpractice. Condoms Distributed</p>
        <p>Health workers sometimes use creative ways to get around restrictions and help deliver full prevention information to patients. At St. Vincent's, materials that may cross the line are stamped with a disclaimer that reads: "This educational material is not published or necessarily advocated by this institution, and may express positions, opinions or attitudes which are not those, or in conformance with those, of this institution or the Roman Catholic church."</p>
        <p>But some individuals go even further. One worker who works in St. Vincent's AIDS clinic said he has kept condoms hidden in an office to give out when necessary.</p>
        <p>"We need to teach people who don't use condoms how to use them," the worker said. "For that they have to be in hand."</p>
        <p>Not all Catholic hospitals across the country, about 600 of them, face the same restrictions. In areas like Chicago, for instance, AIDS workers at Catholic institutions can inform patients about condoms as long as they do not promote their use or distribute them. At St. Mary's Hospital and Medical Center in San Francisco, the AIDS staff distributes condoms and needle cleaning kits at their discretion.</p>
        <p>The flexibility is actually rooted in a 1987 policy statement on AIDS issued by the United States Catholic Conference's administrative board. The board, which represents the nation's bishops, said discussion about condoms was acceptable as long as it was accompanied by Catholic moral teaching on abstinence, fidelity and avoidance of drugs.</p>
        <p>Although some bishops have chosen to follow this guideline, Cardinal O'Connor opposed it, saying it would confuse Catholics because it gives the impression the bishops were wavering on their condemnation of birth control. The objections from Cardinal O'Connor and others led to a subsequent statement by the board that, without replacing the original, called for reliance on abstinence outside marriage to prevent AIDS. Church Defends Care</p>
        <p>Officials at St. Vincent's Hospital defend their procedures, emphasizing the quality of their medical care. "The state is comfortable with what we're doing," said Mr. Savage. "This hospital has provided a tremendous amount of support in terms of medical care for patients with AIDS."</p>
        <p>Hospital officials attributed the World AIDS Day incident to a lack of coordination and said there were plans for instituting a process to review materials about AIDS prevention and insure that it conforms to the hospital's standards.</p>
        <p>"I don't want it just to be ignored, so we don't run into the situation we had this year," said Dr. Gabriel Torres, director of the AIDS program. "We have to deal with this so we can move ahead."</p>
        <p>The church's position on AIDS prevention information has put it at odds with state health regulators. Two years ago, for instance, when the Archdiocese of New York sought state approval to open nursing homes for AIDS patients, it refused to accept state guidelines that would have compelled it to provide AIDS prevention counseling that would violate its teachings. The state then agreed that patients could be referred to other agencies to receive condoms, safer-sex counseling and other prevention services.</p>
        <p>Last year, New York City officials and Catholic-run group homes agreed to have foster teen-age children receive birth control and AIDS counseling at outside agencies if the teen-agers request it. More than half of them have, said Joel Berger, a senior lawyer in the city's Law Department.</p>
        <p>People familiar with the negotiations with the church over the nursing homes said that alternatives, like using outside counselors for such education, were rejected by attorneys for the church with a "not under our roof." They said the state came out so bruised from that fight that it backed away from issuing well-defined requirements on AIDS prevention counseling for institutions it finances.</p>
        <p>The 24 hospitals designated by the state Health Department to provide comprehensive AIDS care, for example, must provide only what is generically described as "information and educational programs concerning AIDS prevention."</p>
        <p>As a result, education on AIDS prevention is not provided uniformly at the 24 hospitals. At St. Vincent's, for example, AIDS workers say it is not known how many in the staff provide full disclosure. Even those who do say they do so selectively.</p>
        <p>"It depends on the patient." said one worker. "I get a lot of Hispanic Catholics. If I perceive that the patient will tell on me for being open, then I don't go with my whole spiel."</p>
