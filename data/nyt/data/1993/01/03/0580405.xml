        <p>Festivities will blossom in the spring in six states along the length of the Oregon Trail during the 150th anniversary of the movement that settled the West. A wagon train retracing the trail's route from Independence, Mo., to Oregon City, Ore., will be a highlight of the celebration honoring the 350,000 pioneers who traveled the trail in search of gold, land and a better life. From 1842 to 1860, the trail carried them west along a route stretching 2,200 miles across Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon.</p>
        <p>The 1993 wagon train is scheduled to roll in mid-April and halt five months later, according to the Oregon Trail Coordinating Council. The states along the trail are planning trail markers, historical displays and exhibits, plays and festivals. Information about plans and events are available from Metropolitan Events, 208 N.W. Couch Street, Suite 222, Portland, Ore. 97209, (503) 223-6191, or from the Oregon Trail Coordinating Council, 22 N.W. Davis, Suite 309, Portland, Ore. 97209.</p>

        <p>For visitors who would like to ride a wagon train, ranches in states along the trail offer such adventures each summer, like the Oregon Trail Wagon Train, in Bayard, Neb., which sends fleets of Conestoga-style and other wagons across the prairie June through September. Guests ride on the wagons or on horseback, eat meals from a chuckwagon and sing over campfires, and sleep in wagons or on bedrolls under the stars. Trips last from 24 hours to six days, depending on the package, and cost from $150 to $579 and $125 to $484 for children under 12. Information: Oregon Trail Wagon Train, Route 2, Box 502, Bayard, Neb. 69334; (308) 586-1850.</p>
