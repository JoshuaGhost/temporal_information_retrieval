        <p>JUST like a car or other vehicle, houses need regular inspections and care to operate smoothly and prevent small problems from becoming large ones. Organizing a year-round schedule is a key to keeping up with repairs. A season-by-season approach assures that work will be time for the best results.</p>
        <p>SPRING As early in the season as possible, make a thorough tour of the exterior.  Look out for damage caused by winter weather and be prepared to make spot repairs to roofs and siding before leaks appear. They are common during spring rains.</p>
        <p>See that gutters are clear and working properly and that splash blocks or other drainage aids are placed beneath downspouts, the vertical pipes leading from gutters to the ground, so that water cascading from them is channeled away from the foundation.</p>
        <p>Unless that is done, even sound basement walls can leak, causing flooding. If the basement has cracks, now is the time to patch them on the inside. Hold off on outside foundation repairs until the ground dries later in the spring or in summer.</p>
        <p>Also early on have fireplace chimneys and stovepipes cleaned. Furnace chimneys seldom need cleaning. If you wait until fall, soot deposits will harden, making removal more difficult and increasing the risk of fire. If the furnace supplies steam heat, spring is the time to drain the boiler.</p>
        <p>As the weather warms, prepare window and door screens and wash Venetian blinds and shades. If you have time prepare outdoor furniture and the lawnmower. Also, assess the need for major exterior repairs like painting, roof and foundation work. It is important to plan those early before contractors' schedules or your own summer plans are filled.</p>
        <p>SUMMER This is when to perform the bulk of outdoor tasks, but it is also the best time for indoor projects that require plenty of ventilation, like refinishing floors and stripping woodwork. Examine porches and decks for signs of rot or rusted metal railings, and repair them before they receive heavy use. Check the foundation for signs of termites. Infestations by those or other pests should be eliminated by a professional exterminator. Mend broken screens in vents and louvers and repair windows.</p>
        <p>Restore damaged masonry and seal asphalt driveways when temperatures are unlikely to dip below 55 degrees at night and no rain is forecast for at least 24 hours.</p>
        <p>Pay special attention to mending flashing, soffits, fascia boards and other trim. Prune foliage away from air-conditioners to improve their cooling and away from siding to prevent mildew.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of August, have the heating system serviced by a technician from the local utility or a heating company. Taking care of that in the summer puts you ahead of the rush, and your house will be prepared in case of an early cold snap.</p>
        <p>FALL This season can often be as busy as spring, with preparations the winter. Finishing lingering outdoor repairs and sealing cracks and crevices to prevent heat loss are paramount activities. Fix potential plumbing problems that could lead to frozen pipes. Shut off outdoor water supplies or install freezeproof faucets, wrap vulnerable pipes with heating tape and cover them with foam insulation.</p>
        <p>Fall is also a good time for working in uninsulated attics that tend to be stifling or freezing at other times of the year. The Federal Energy Department recommends that residential attic insulation in most of the Northeast should have a thermal rating, or R-value, of 49. That translates to a thickness of 19 1/4 inches of fiberglass or mineral wool.  Make sure there has been no movement of insulation along the roof peak, possibly causing gaps, or where insulation covers the eaves above the soffits. Those conditions can lead to ice dams, melting snow high on the roof that refreezes along the eaves, eventually working its way beneath shingles and causing roof leaks.</p>
        <p>Take advantage of the cooler weather to straighten or reorganize the garage and service the garage door. Also, lubricate sliding storm windows and check that they operate smoothly well in advance of the day that you lower them. After the leaves have fallen, clean the gutters, window wells and outdoor cellar entrances so that they can drain.</p>
        <p>WINTER Move indoors. Holiday activities usually take up most of December, but it is a good time to clean marble, floors, furniture and other surfaces. After Jan. 1 concentrate on fixing squeaky stairs, easing doors that rub, mending broken furniture and other tasks involving wood. Because humidity levels are lowest at this time of year, repairs will most likely be more effective than those made in other months when wood holds more moisture and may be somewhat swollen.</p>
        <p>Winter days are also suitable for making electrical repairs and fixing leaky faucets. And as the season begins to drag, take on projects aimed at brightening your home, like painting, wallpapering or remodeling.</p>
