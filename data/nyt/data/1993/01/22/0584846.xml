        <p>Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher said today that he doubted that the international mediation effort to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina would succeed, his spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher's spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said at the State Department briefing this morning that although the Clinton Administration generally supports the negotiations, Mr. Christopher "expressed doubts about whether it can realistically be achieved, whether they can, in fact, find an agreement, find a solution that's peaceful that the parties would, in fact, agree to."</p>

        <p>Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher said today that he doubted that the international mediation effort to end the fighting in Bosnia and Herzegovina would succeed, his spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher's spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said at the State Department briefing this morning that although the Clinton Administration generally supports the negotiations, Mr. Christopher "expressed doubts about whether it can realistically be achieved, whether they can, in fact, find an agreement, find a solution that's peaceful that the parties would, in fact, agree to."</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher's remarks have put the Administration in the awkward position of publicly supporting a negotiating process while criticizing -- and perhaps undermining -- the particular plan that is on the table.  Settlement 'That Will Stick'</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher, who is a holdover from the Bush Administration, pointed to two obstacles: the fact that the parties engaged in the Geneva-based talks have broken their commitments to agreements in the past, and that the fighting and atrocities have been "so horrible" that it is very difficult to bring the parties together.</p>
        <p>"Obviously, it's a very difficult task to bring them to a political settlement that will stick and that will actually solve the situation with the agreement of different parties," Mr. Boucher said.  The new Administration has found it particularly difficult to formulate a position on the peace plan advanced by the United Nations-European Community mediation team, which would establish a Bosnian confederation of 10 autonomous regions, most with strong majorities of one of the three main national groups. Experience Under Vance</p>
        <p>For example, even as Mr. Boucher was expressing doubts about the feasibility of the plan, twice during the briefing he said that the new Administration supported the negotiations led by Cyrus R. Vance, the special United Nations envoy, and Lord Owen, the European Community representative.</p>
        <p>Complicating matters is the broad spectrum of opinion within Mr. Clinton's foreign-policy team on the peace plan, ranging from cautious support of it as an imperfect but potential means of ending the bloodshed, to strong criticism because the settlement could be perceived as appeasement of the Serbs, who have made most of the gains in the fighting, and would rely too much on their goodwill when they have repeatedly broken promises in the past.</p>
        <p>Another problem is that a number of Mr. Clinton's senior foreign-policy advisers worked for Mr. Vance when he was Secretary of State in the Carter Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher was Mr. Vance's Deputy Secretary, and the national security adviser, W. Anthony Lake, and his deputy, Samuel R. Berger, held key positions in the Carter-era State Department. One senior Administration official called discussion of the peace plan "agonizing" because of the deep respect felt for Mr. Vance.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Christopher has sought to distance himself from his former boss, and appeared to align himself with the more skeptical Administration view during his Senate confirmation hearings last week. Senator Joseph R. Biden, the Delaware Democrat, said he found it a "bit bizarre" that some of the Serbs involved in the negotiations are people the United States has labeled as suspected war criminals, and asked Mr. Christopher whether he was concerned that a map drawn up under the Geneva peace plan "ratified the atrocites of ethnic cleansing," the forcible expulsion of other ethnic groups from areas seized by the Serbs.</p>
        <p>"I do have a personal concern along these lines," Mr. Christopher replied, but added that the United States was not a party to those negotiations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher declined to say today whether the Clinton Administration believed the Vance-Owen plan ratified ethnic cleansing.</p>
        <p>Within the department, those who support the Vance-Owen approach argue that if the primary parties engaged in the talks -- the Bosnian Serbs, the Bosnian Croats and the Bosnian Muslims -- agree on a settlement, then it is not up to the United States to stand in their way.</p>
        <p>Opposing them are officials who question the wisdom of negotiating with Radovan Karadzic, president of the self-proclaimed Serbian Republic of Bosnia, and Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Serbian republic, who were on the Bush Administration's list of possible war criminals. Clinton Team's Options</p>
        <p>Mr. Vance said in an interview in Geneva this week that Mr. Christopher personally backed his negotiations. Senior Administration officials did not dispute that Mr. Christopher generally supported the negotiating process, but cautioned that he had made no commitments on the plan. When the two men spoke by telephone several days ago, Mr. Christopher agreed to take a "hard look" at the plan, but "rendered no judgments or comments," a senior official said.</p>
        <p>The new Administration regards the crisis in the Balkans as the most difficult foreign-policy problem it will have to address immediately. In her confirmation hearings today as chief United States representative to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright called the crisis in the Balkans "clearly the highest priority of the President in the National Security Council's agenda," adding that the N.S.C. would meet very soon to discuss the matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has ruled out the use of American ground troops in Bosnia, and Ms. Albright reiterated his support for speedy enforcement of a United Nations-mandated ban on flights by the three Bosnian factions and called for the creation of an international tribunal to try war criminals.</p>
        <p>Other Administration officials said they are studying other options. Among those under consideration: a campaign to selectively lift the United Nations-imposed arms embargo, which now favors the better-armed Serbs; a further tightening of the economic sanctions; a plan for guaranteeing and enforcing any peace settlement so that it could not be misused by Serbs as a ploy to avoid outside military intervention, and a more aggressive plan through the United Nations to deliver relief aid throughout Bosnia, even if it required military intervention.</p>
