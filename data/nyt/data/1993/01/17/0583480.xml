        <p>"$68.50! That drives me crazy!" Henrietta, Dorothy, Yvette, Pearl, Gertrude and Sylvia are all on the line, peppering a government administrator with questions about New York State's prescription drug program for the elderly.</p>
        <p>For the ladies patched into this conference call, getting the ear of a bureaucrat on the telephone is more than a convenience. This educational party line, sustained by donations to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, is a lifeline for impoverished, infirm seniors who might otherwise never receive the help they need.</p>
        <p>Their advanced age makes it hard for these women to trek to government offices to obtain services specifically designed to help them. And many seniors are legally blind; they cannot read a mailed brochure or cope with the bureaucratic runaround of being told to dial several different numbers just to get one query answered.</p>
        <p>Without the conference calls, operated under the auspices of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the problems that afflict these proud but isolated women would multiply dangerously. Declining interest rates on savings and pensions, the soaring cost of living in New York City and cutbacks in local services add heavily to their burdens.</p>
        <p>The Neediest Cases Fund, now in its 81st appeal, addresses the special plight of the aged. Through a variety of nonsectarian programs providing transportation, home visits, telephone links and other vital services, the fund helps needy seniors maintain their health and a higher quality of life, so that the universally difficult process of growing old is not a daily agony of pain, poverty and isolation.</p>
        <p>"'You're a very nice person," one of the women said into the phone. The conference call participants are quick to praise the administrator who has patiently answered their questions and promised assistance. But without private help, the link would never have been established.</p>
        <p>The sole purpose of the Neediest Cases Fund is to find and assist the overlooked and the helpless, to care for this city's most vulnerable citizens.</p>
        <p>The fund passes every dollar to the neediest through seven private social service agencies. No money is kept back for administration or solicitation.</p>
        <p>Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. Any amount is welcome. Checks should be made payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to P.O. Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.</p>
