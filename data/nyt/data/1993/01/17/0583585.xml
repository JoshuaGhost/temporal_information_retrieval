        <p>BILL CLINTON'S inclination to emphasize reducing the budget deficit, even at the risk of breaking campaign promises, might lead one to think that he has at last seen the light. But when it comes to the deficit, there is no light. If how to deal with it were a multiple-choice question, the possible correct answers would fill this page.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and his team focused last week on deficit-cutting because the latest Government figures had projected that the deficit would rise again, reaching $327 billion this year. Their reaction suggested that fighting deficits is a response to true economic principle. But dealing with deficits is not a matter of truth. It is a matter of judgments about how Americans should live, now and in the future.</p>
        <p>"The first thing to do is to demystify deficits," said Robert Heilbroner, an economic historian, offering a view held not only by fellow liberals but also by conservatives like Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns &amp; Company. "The deficit hysteria is unfounded," Mr. Kudlow said flatly.</p>
        <p>The Federal budget, in fact, has been in deficit every year since 1969, and almost no one holds out hope of getting rid of big deficits in this century. The question is how to regulate them so that they work for the country rather than against it. And here there is room for endless disagreement.</p>
        <p>"Anything you do about the deficit involves making a choice from among competing values," said Joseph White, a senior researcher at the Brookings Institution and co-author of "The Deficit and the Public Interest."</p>
        <p>"But these competing values don't show up until you propose to do something about the deficit."</p>
        <p>The debate over the budget always seems to highlight phrases like "profligate spending," "living beyond our means" and "saddling our children and grandchildren with our debts" -- as if the Government always behaved like parents who leave their children $10,000 in cash and $30,000 in a still unpaid car loan for a B.M.W. Ross Perot, campaigning as a deficit-cutter, drew on public antipathy to such unthrifty behavior. But what if the debt that the children inherited had paid not for a car, but for their college education? Does that make them willing to pay off their parents' loans?</p>
        <p>The comparison is not far-fetched. Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, a man uneasy about big deficits, draws the parallel in this example. What if the Administration and Congress spent $300 billion over several years, adding much of it to the deficit, to clean up pollution and to help urban ghetto families rise from poverty? Would the environmental and social dividends make the next generation willing to pay the bill?</p>
        <p>"The basic issue is how much do you want to emphasize future standards of living versus present standards of living," Mr. Reischauer said. "That requires a value judgment, and the deficit is an element in the equation." Bad to Worse</p>
        <p>The Office of Management and Budget, in newly released projections, estimated Federal budget deficits for fiscal 1993 and 1994 that are higher than earlier estimates as well as last year's $290 billion figure. New projections are due later this month from the Congressional Budget Office, and they also are likely to show deficits this year and next that are somewhat higher than earlier estimates.</p>
        <p>Reacting to the figures, Mr. Clinton's nominees to top economic posts dashed hopes for quick action on the middle-class tax cuts that Mr. Clinton promised during the campaign. But in Senate confirmation hearings, they stuck by proposals that might require increased deficit spending for job training or investment in public works -- and thereby made value judgments.</p>
        <p>Another judgment will undoubtedly involve health care. The new deficit projections reflect sharply rising Medicare and Medicaid outlays, and if the Clinton Administration tries to cap these in the cause of cutting the deficit, said Audrey Freedman, a labor economist and consultant, it will have made a de facto social choice.</p>
        <p>"In the name of bringing Medicaid-Medicare costs under control, we will probably end up cutting back medical care for the elderly," Ms. Freedman said. "Someone who is working might get very expensive kidney dialysis, because it would get that person back to work, but an elderly person might not."</p>
        <p>The deficit can get too high, of course. That would happen if it rose much more rapidly than the national wealth, like a family floating a mortgage to purchase a vacation home when its income is not rising and it barely has enough to pay the mortgage on its main home and meet its other expenses. "The danger comes when the deficit grows explosively over a long period of time; that has not happened yet," said Francis M. Bator, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.</p>
        <p>The deficit last year was equal to 4.9 percent of the $6 trillion in new wealth created in the United States, as measured by the gross domestic product. That is well above the 2.9 percent in 1989, but is not considered high for a country emerging from the costs of lost tax revenue, higher unemployment insurance and other outlays associated with a recession. The deficit hit 6.3 percent of G.D.P. in 1983, as the nation came out of the last recession, and it stayed at 5 percent or more until 1987.  Debts and Jobs</p>
        <p>The big debate over values will come if the national wealth -- the family income -- fails to rise rapidly enough to accomplish two things at once: to keep up installment payments on the rising national debt and create enough new jobs to bring the unemployment rate, now at 7.3 percent, below 6 percent within a year or two.</p>
        <p>To achieve this goal, many economists contend, the gross domestic product must grow at an annual rate of well over 3 percent for several years -- and if it does not, then the Government should spur the growth through public investments and other job-creating measures, even if this temporarily adds to the deficit.</p>
        <p>There are two major value judgments in this view. One is that putting people back to work so quickly is more important than the risk of higher inflation and higher interest rates on loans, both often by-products of strong economic growth. Rarely, if ever, have political leaders led the public in a debate over a safe, acceptable level of inflation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has not ruled publicly on the issue of inflation versus job growth, but he does hold to a belief that Wall Street economists like Mr. Kudlow and many other Americans do not share. The assumption that Mr. Clinton has promoted is that public investment creates rather than wastes wealth; that new highways, bridges, and research facilities, Americans and their companies more efficient and prosperous.</p>
        <p>Disagreeing, Mr. Kudlow says: "The private sector is always a more efficient resource user than government." The bottom line of such a view is that government should not borrow and spend if it raises the deficit in the process. The national savings should be left for corporate America to invest, in its own good time.</p>
        <p>"The deficit is a label that hides a lot of judgments," Mr. Reischauer said. "One has to look under the hood, to borrow a Ross Perot metaphor, to make a judgment as to how large a deficit we as a society should be willing to tolerate."</p>
