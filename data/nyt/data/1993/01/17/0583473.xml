        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article might have been more properly titled "Greenspan's Gift to Bank Stockholders." As I understand it, banks borrow much of their operating funds from the Federal Government, at a rate kept low by Mr. Greenspan supposedly to encourage bank lending. But the banks can turn this money around and buy Treasury bonds paying 5 percent or even 7 percent. Let's call this outright gift to the banks what it is -- a bailout. (This also creates a voodoo market for Treasury securities, since the Government is, in effect, lending money to purchase its own bonds.)</p>

        <p>As Representative Charles Schumer put it, "Any idiot can make money by taking it in at 3 percent and lending it at 7 percent." But the taxpayers are the idiots who are paying the difference. The matter could be resolved by forbidding bank purchases of securities, thus forcing them to put the money to work as loans to business. SIMON DRESNER  pring Valley, N.Y., Dec. 20</p>
