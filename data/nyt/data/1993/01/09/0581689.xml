        <p>The latest showdown between Washington and Baghdad demonstrates once again, two years after the fact, how sharply the denouement of the war in the Persian Gulf differed from what the victorious allies expected at the time.</p>
        <p>By defeating Saddam Hussein's armies in the field, President Bush and other Western leaders concluded, they had weakened him to the point that he would either be toppled in a coup or find it impossible to resist the enforcement of the United Nations resolutions designed to curb his powers.</p>
        <p>But the Iraqi President remains in charge, and he has retained enough power to tweak the nose of the United States and the United Nations again and again. He hindered the inspection teams trying to prevent Iraq from rebuilding a nuclear capacity. He cut the routes used by convoys carrying relief supplies to the Kurds in the north. And then he moved surface-to-air missiles into position to threaten allied plans patrolling the no-flight zone in the south.  No Quick Solutions</p>
        <p>With only 10 days left in his Presidency, Mr. Bush took to the phones again, lining up support for air strikes against the Iraqis if the missiles were not moved. But whether they are moved far enough fast enough to suit the Americans, the President is in no position in the gulf -- any more than he is in Somalia or Bosnia -- to wrap up the trouble neatly before Jan. 20 and present Bill Clinton with a relatively clean foreign-policy slate.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Hussein complied with the allied demands, which he would almost certainly do only while proclaiming to the world and to his own people that he had no intention of doing so, or if he dismantled the missiles, as appeared possible tonight, little would be resolved. He would retain the capacity to move them into a hostile position once more, or to test the allies in other ways.</p>
        <p>A number of Middle East analysts, for instance, fear that the Iraqi leader may try to further suppress resistance among the Iraqi Kurds, who live along the border with Turkey. Between 1988 and 1989, Iraqi troops are believed to have killed more than 150,000 Kurds, perhaps as many as 200,000, and Pentagon officials said Baghdad retains ample military capacity to carry out another such slaughter.</p>
        <p>If the missiles are not moved, and air strikes are carried out, a possibility that seemed to be receding as the deadline passed, it is difficult to see how the strikes could have more than a transitory effect. Iraq might lose some anti-aircraft missiles or some other aging military equipment if Mr. Bush decided to strike at the missiles themselves. He might lose more if the raids hit established bases rather than the mobile missiles, but nothing that he could not quickly replace.</p>
        <p>According to American intelligence reports, the Iraqis have kept their best missile batteries, equipped with Soviet-built SA-11's and SA-13's, well north of the no-flight zone imposed to protect Shiite Muslim rebels. The missiles that were moved there, touching off the present crisis, are older, obsolescent models considered expendable. Former Allies Unallied</p>
        <p>But the resistance of nations like Egypt, Syria and Turkey, which were crucial allies in the 1991 conflict, will make it very difficult to strike at Baghdad itself, European diplomats said. Nor is there much support for attacks on the resources that keep Mr. Hussein in power, from the rebuilt munitions factories to the barracks of the elite troops based in the Baghdad region.</p>
        <p>The high-tech weapons of which American commanders were so proud during the war, and which constitute one of the main Western advantages in the continuing conflict with Mr. Hussein, are of very limited use in this situation.</p>
        <p>From Mr. Hussein's point of view, the war of nerves is very useful. It gives him a chance to posture as the defender of Iraqi sovereignty, as the man who takes the West right to the brink. To the degree that that prompts feelings of patriotism and diverts attention from the raging inflation and the epidemic of shortages caused by economic sanctions, he is clearly the beneficiary.</p>
        <p>Laurie Mylroie, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, thinks the Iraqi President and his circle are convinced that they won the war, in the sense that they clung to power in the face of overwhelming firepower and diplomatic strength. They "stood up to the Americans."</p>
        <p>"Watching him on Iraqi television when I was there in November," Ms. Mylroie said, "it was stunning to see his self-confidence and his arrogance, and his evident pleasure in public adulation, however obviously coerced.  Bombing isn't going to change that much. It has very limited utility."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, she suggested, will have to decide for himself whether to reformulate American goals to include the elimination of Mr. Hussein or accept the fact that the Security Council resolutions cannot be fully enforced until he loses power. An Uncertain Policy</p>
        <p>In a speech in October, Mr. Clinton, who rather reluctantly supported the use of force in the gulf two years ago, hinted that he might adopt a tougher policy in the region if elected. It was a mistake, he said then, to urge the Kurds and the Shiites to resist and then do little to support them.</p>
        <p>But the President-elect has never suggested that he would be willing to contemplate allied military incursions to help the rebels. At any rate, such an intervention would almost certainly be resisted by the Pentagon on the ground that it constituted an open-ended commitment in an unstable region.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Clinton remained the foreign-policy team player he has been since November. Mr. Bush had consulted him "about the action that the President proposed to take," he said, "and I agree with the action."</p>
