        <p>Almost two weeks after she disappeared, the Suffolk County police have found no trace of 10-year-old Katie Beers, and the County Police Commissioner said yesterday that the search has been complicated by a long-running dispute between Katie's mother and Katie's godmother, with whom the child spent most of her life.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Beers, Katie's mother, and Linda Inghilleri, Katie's godmother, have admitted quarreling for some time over the girl's care. Over the last few months, the two women said in separate interviews, Katie repeatedly changed her mind about which woman she wanted to live with.</p>
        <p>The tension, Police Commissioner, Peter F. Cosgrove said yesterday, has complicated an already difficult case.</p>
        <p>"We have a girl who was torn between two apparently dysfunctional family groups," he said. "That situation produces so many leads to track down, and it's what makes this one more unique than most."</p>
        <p>Commissioner Cosgrove added that investigators routinely consider the family situation in such cases but that in this one it played an even larger role.</p>
        <p>"Here you have a custody dispute between two families and allegations of sexual abuse," he said, "so there's so much more to follow up on."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Inghilleri's husband, Sal, was arrested in October on charges of sexual abuse involving Katie. He has pleaded not guilty and is to appear in court in February. After the arrest, the district attorney ordered Mr. Inghilleri to stay away from Katie.</p>
        <p>For most of Katie's life, she had lived predominantly with the Inghilleris. But in January 1992, after a family quarrel, she moved in permanently with her mother in Mastic Beach.  Few Leads</p>
        <p>To what degree Katie's family life played a role in her disappearance is uncertain. But it is against this backdrop that the police continue to search for the girl, who was reported kidnapped from a video arcade in Nesconset at about 4:30 P.M. on Dec. 28. Since then, the investigation has made little progress and there have been few leads, the police say.</p>
        <p>In the latest twist in the case, Mrs. Inghilleri and her husband, Sal, who live in Bay Shore, gave the police a note Thursday night that they said was from Katie. Mr. Inghilleri said yesterday that the note, which is addressed to his wife and signed "love Always, Katherine," suggests to him and his wife that the girl may have run away, an alternative they had previously ruled out as impossible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Inghilleri said the note begins, "You are my favorite person in the world but I am stuck in the middle of you and Marylin," and it continued, "So it is very hard for me to decied who I want to live with Becaus I have lived with yo both."</p>
        <p>Mr. Inghilleri said a psychic, Linda Panzarella, who is assisting the family, discovered the note at about 8 P.M. Thursday in a book between two files in a drawer in Katie's desk in the Inghilleri home.</p>
        <p>The police had searched the room thoroughly many days ago, but apparently missed the note, Mr. Inghilleri said. The house has been under 24-hour guard since the girl disappeared, so it is unlikely that someone could have sneaked it in since then, he added.</p>
        <p>The police said they were examining the note to confirm that the handwriting matches the girl's, but Commissioner Cosgrove said it is not being interpreted as a runaway note. "Nowhere in the letter does it say anything about running away," he said.</p>
        <p>At a news conference this afternoon in Mastic Beach, Miss Beers, Katie's mother, called the letter "a fake." She was was accompanied by her own psychic, John Monti, who is also acting as her spokesman.</p>
        <p>Miss Beers said the handwriting in the letter did not resemble her daughter's and that there were many misspellings that were uncharacteristic of Katie. She added that the letter also refers to her as Marilyn, when Katie always called her Mom.</p>
        <p>On the day Katie disappeared, Mrs. Inghilleri received a message on her answering machine in which the girl screamed and cried that she was being kidnapped by "a man with a knife."</p>
        <p>John Esposito, a family friend who had picked up Katie from the Inghilleris earlier that day, said the girl had vanished shortly after the two of them had arrived at the Space Plex video arcade in Nesconset. He said he notified the arcade's security guards as soon as he realized that she had disappeared.</p>
        <p>The police have been unable to find any witnesses who saw both Mr. Esposito and Katie at the arcade. While they have traced Katie's message to a public telephone not far from the arcade, Commissioner Cosgrove said that it has been difficult to determine whether the message was prerecorded and that he believed it was doubtful that they would ever be able to reach any conclusions about that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Esposito, who was questioned by the police for 18 hours on Dec. 28 and 29, has denied any role in the girl's disappearance. The police searched his home and car last week, seizing several things, including an instruction manual for a tape recorder and bedding with two stains, which they refused to describe further.</p>
        <p>Sidney Siben, a lawyer for Mr. Esposito, said last week that the police considered his client a suspect.  He confirmed that Mr. Esposito had pleaded guilty about 15 years ago to the unlawful imprisonment of a 12-year-old boy.</p>
