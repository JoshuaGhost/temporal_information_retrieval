        <p>The Free Democratic Party nominated Gunter Rexrodt, a onetime banker, businessman and native of East Germany, as Economics Minister today in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's beleaguered coalition Government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl, a Christian Democrat, is expected to approve the nomination and appoint Mr. Rexrodt, 51, as part of a Cabinet shuffle in the next two weeks.</p>
        <p>Jurgen W. Mollemann, Mr. Rexrodt's predecessor, announced last Sunday that he would resign because of a scandal over letters he wrote on behalf of a relative's business last year. Mr. Mollemann, 47, also gave up hopes of becoming his party's leader later this year.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, a former chief of German intelligence who joined the party only two years ago, now seems all but assured of succeeding Count Otto Lambsdorff as leader in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rexrodt assumes a post once held by postwar political leaders like Ludwig Erhard at a time when the challenges of German unification a recession that has driven unemployment above three million seem almost as great as those faced by the father of the "economic miracle."</p>
        <p>His banking and business career was in Berlin, where he also served in the city government as Finance Minister in the late 1980's. More recently he was a board member of the federal Government agency in charge of privatizing the state-owned industries of the formerly Communist eastern part of the country.</p>
        <p>Describing him as a man of competence, the conservative daily Die Welt said this week, "Even his supporters will not classify him as the brilliant first choice that economic policy in a united Germany now requires."</p>
        <p>As Economics Minister, he will be expected to help lead Germany out of a recession that has been partly brought on by previous Government policies of heavy borrowing to finance the reconstruction of the east.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Mr. Kohl's Government has begun to talk instead of asking the well-off Germans in the west to sacrifice a little. Reports of proposals for sweeping cuts in social benefits and Government spending to finance the $100 billion a year needed to rebuild the east have been sharply criticized by the Social Democratic opposition and by union leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl's coalition has been in some disarray since Hans-Dietrich Genscher unexpectedly resigned as Foreign Minister last spring. Finance Minister Theo Waigel, a Bavarian conservative, openly denounced the Free Democrats for treating the Economics Ministry as if they owned the right to dictate to Mr. Kohl who Mr. Mollemann's successor should be. They asserted that the coalition agreement gives them the right to nominate the minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rexrodt was narrowly defeated by Mr. Mollemann for the job two years ago. He said today that he would do his best to bring forward the reconstruction of eastern Germany and a speedy recovery from recession in the west.</p>
        <p>To make sure that Mr. Rexrodt would not suffer the fate of Mr. Genscher's first successor, Irmgard Schwaetzer, who was rejected by the party rank and file after being nominated by party leaders, the Free Democratic members of Parliament and the entire national leadership picked him by secret ballot, with 57 out of 97 votes cast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl also has to find a successor to the Minister of Posts and Communications, Christian Schwarz-Schilling, who resigned late last year in protest against what he said was the Government's inaction in the Balkan crisis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohl's coalition has not been able to agree on the conditions under which German troops can be sent abroad on United Nations peacekeeping missions. The Defense Minister, Volker Ruhe, has asserted that the 1949 Constitution would permit it, but some Free Democrats argue that it does not.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, is to arrive here on Sunday night for a visit, and Mr. Kohl had hoped to have a unified position on the issue to discuss with him then.</p>
