        <p>Is CBS's decision to lure David Letterman from NBC on the Top 10 list of smart programming moves? Or will the waspish host of television's first post-modern talk show turn out to be the Joey Bishop of the 1990's?</p>

        <p>Is CBS's decision to lure David Letterman from NBC on the Top 10 list of smart programming moves? Or will the waspish host of television's first post-modern talk show turn out to be the Joey Bishop of the 1990's?</p>
        <p>For advertising agency executives responsible for buying commercial time, whose judgments will help answer those questions, Mr. Letterman's prospects are uncertain. For every success in late night television, there have been a score of misfires by the likes of Dennis Miller, Dick Cavett and Mr. Bishop.</p>
        <p>CBS rolled out the red carpet for Mr. Letterman yesterday, while Jay Leno let out a sigh of relief that NBC would keep him in his "Tonight" show slot.  [ Page C26. ]  NBC has been broadcasting a national late night chat program under variations of the title "Tonight" for almost 39 years. "Tonight" has been the most profitable program ever on television.</p>
        <p>By contrast, CBS's track record at 11:30 P.M., Eastern time, has ranged from adequate (the current "Crime Time After Prime Time," noir-tinged dramas about bare-chested detectives) to unfortunate (the quiz master Pat Sajak as a would-be Johnny Carson). 'A Buyer's Dream'</p>
        <p>Sure to be winners, however, are the consumer-product marketers for which the advertising executives purchase spots. They will benefit significantly from the proliferation of new options. In the time period not so long ago, sponsors and viewers were limited totalk shows and the nth rerun of movies like "Hellcats of the Navy."</p>
        <p>"We like the idea of competition enormously," Aaron Cohen, senior vice president and director of national broadcast at Ayer Inc. in New York, said yesterday. "It's a wonderful opportunity for advertisers."</p>
        <p>Jerome (Jerry) Dominus, senior vice president and director of national television and programming at J. Walter Thompson U.S.A. in New York, was exultant.</p>
        <p>"It's a buyer's dream," he said. "There's a lot to pick from."</p>
        <p>"Do you like Letterman?" he asked. "Or do you like Leno? Do you like Chevy? And there's still Arsenio."</p>
        <p>His references were to comedian Chevy Chase, who has been hired by the Fox network to play host for a talk show from 11 P.M. to midnight beginning in September, and Arsenio Hall, whose show, syndicated by Paramount Communications, runs on local stations at various times around both "Tonight" and "Late Night with David Letterman," which NBC has been broadcasting weeknights at 12:30 since 1982.</p>
        <p>The fractioning of the late-night audience, however, could present problems for advertisers that must reach certain audiences, like men 18 to 34, who are likely to be split when Mr. Letterman starts competing against Mr. Leno.</p>
        <p>"If you bought 30 spots in a campaign," said Paul Schulman, president at the Paul Schulman Company in New York, a media buying service, "you'll have to buy 40 and spread them around." But that should not be too difficult, he added, for skillful buyers who take advantage of "all the alternatives, which are terrific from a negotiating standpoint."</p>
        <p>Those executives doubtful about Mr. Letterman's chances cite CBS's historic lack of hits at 11:30.</p>
        <p>"It's a new program at a time where CBS has never succeeded before," said Hal Katz, chief executive at Katz Dochtermann &amp; Epstein and president at Katz Marketing &amp; Media in New York. "The Letterman audience isn't used to watching CBS then."</p>
        <p>And Betsy Frank, senior vice president and director of television information and new media at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising in New York, expressed concerns over "how Letterman will play in an earlier time period, where the need is for someone with a little more mass appeal."</p>
        <p>By making "Late Night with David Letterman" a talk show that mocks the conventions of the genre, Mr. Letterman has concentrated his popularity among younger, urban, more affluent viewers. According to NBC data for the period from Nov. 30 through last week, for instance, 38 percent of the "Late Night" audience was 18 to 34, compared with 27 percent for "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno." Conversely, 24 percent was 50 and over, compared with 38 percent for Mr. Leno's program.</p>
        <p>Those taking the other side in the debate also make a convincing case.</p>
        <p>"Letterman is no fool," said Mr. Dominus at Thompson. "He knows he's going to have to get a feel for whether he should risk alienating his core constituency in order to broaden his appeal."</p>
        <p>Mr. Schulman believes that Mr. Letterman's "fans will not be disappointed" by the tenor and content of his CBS show, "so they'll follow him to CBS." He predicted that this would create difficulties for Mr. Leno, whom they now tune in while warming up the set for "Late Night."</p>
        <p>At CBS, George F. Schweitzer, senior vice president of CBS marketing and communications, said yesterday that "we're already feeling the interest from Madison Avenue." He added that Joseph Abruzzese, the network's senior vice president of sales, "already has the reservations" from interested advertisers.</p>
        <p>To stir further interest, Mr. Schweitzer continued, he plans to meet next week with the producers of the CBS Letterman show to begin discussing promotional projects.</p>
