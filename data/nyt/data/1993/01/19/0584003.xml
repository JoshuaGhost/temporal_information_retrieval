        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article on China's interests in Southeast Asia (front page, Jan. 11), while perceptive, ignores one major element in China's role in that region: its relationship with Myanmar, formerly Burma.</p>
        <p>China has been Myanmar's major ally since the Burmese military coup of September 1988, when foreign assistance was generally cut off. China has since then supplied Myanmar with economic aid, but more important has been the essential military supplier of more sophisticated weapons to the Burmese military.</p>
        <p>The magnitude has been estimated at as much as $1.2 billion. The cross-border China-Myanmar trade, regularized in October 1988, has become a mainstay of the supply of consumer goods in Myanmar. The legal and illegal two-way trade, exclusive of opium and heroin, has been estimated at $1.5 billion.</p>
        <p>China has become, in addition, a major export channel for the 2,300 tons of opium Myanmar produces, most of which, refined as heroin, enters foreign markets. The result of the trade and assistance has been virtual Chinese economic hegemony over much of Myanmar.</p>
        <p>China's role is also strategic. It is halping build better highways south from the China border and is said to seek access to Burmese port facilities on the Bay of Bengal in return.</p>
        <p>This exacerbates Chinese-Indian tensions. Myanmar flanks the still unsettled Northeast frontier region disputed by both China and India since their war of 1962. India is seen by Burma as a potential enemy for historical reasons and has been a strong critic of the Burmese military regime. Pakistan is also said to have supplied the Burmese military with some arms, thus helping to keep India occupied in the east.</p>
        <p>The virtual Chinese-Burmese alliance creates additional tensions in the region, which are often overlooked because of Myanmar's previous isolation. But Myanmar's modest economic liberalization since 1988 has rekindled economic and strategic interest in the country. It seems China plans to play an important role in that arena. DAVID I. STEINBERG  Washington, Jan. 12, 1993</p>
        <p>The writer, professor of Korea studies at Georgetown University, has written widely on Burma and Korea.</p>
