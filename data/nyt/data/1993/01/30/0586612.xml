        <p>Japanese companies have often been accused of selling their products at unfairly low prices in other countries, a practice known as dumping. But today, the shoe was on the other foot.</p>
        <p>For the first time, Japan imposed anti-dumping tariffs on imports from another country. It ruled that Chinese producers of ferrosilicon manganese, a material used in making steel, were selling their products in Japan more cheaply than at home, thereby hurting Japanese competitors.</p>
        <p>The action comes as Japanese officials have been talking about a tougher stance on trade issues and have been annoyed by what they see as excessive use of dumping complaints against Japan by the United States and Europe. Japan has vigorously protested a provisional decision this week by the United States Commerce Department to impose anti-dumping tariffs on steel imports from Japan and 18 other countries.</p>
        <p>Asked whether imposing tariffs on China was inconsistent with protesting action by the United States against Japan, Japanese Government officials said the cases were completely different.</p>
        <p>They said that in the case of Japanese steel exports to the United States, Japan had been restraining exports until last March, and Japan's market share in the United States had been declining. In the case of the ferrosilicon manganese from China, there was no restraint agreement and China's share of the Japanese market had risen sharply, they said.</p>
        <p>The complaint against Chinese manufacturers was initiated in October 1991 by the Japan Ferroalloy Association. Ferrosilicon manganese is used to remove sulfurous compounds and make steel stronger.</p>
        <p>The Government ruled that Chinese exporters were selling the material in Japan for less than in their own country. The Chinese share of Japan's market for ferrosilicon manganese rose to 39 percent in 1991 from 17 percent in 1989, according to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.</p>
        <p>The Government today levied tariffs ranging from 4.5 percent to 27.2 percent on the manufacturers. It did not assess tariffs against one Norwegian and two South African companies that had also been named in the original complaint.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued in Beijing, China called today's decision "unfair," according to Japan's Kyodo news service.</p>
