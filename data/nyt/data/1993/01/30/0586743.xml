        <p>It was the most ordinary of errands, a trip to deposit her paycheck at the Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, that brought Auera Bonnie Vargas to her death.</p>
        <p>As she stepped out the door of her building, Miss Vargas, 41, a teacher at Public School 108 in Harlem, was grabbed by a man fleeing a robbery at a nearby Chemical Bank branch.  He tried to hold the police at bay by using the tall, slender woman as a shield. Moments later, both were felled by gunfire.</p>
        <p>In the aftermath of the wild shootout that broke up a peaceful morning on the Upper West Side, sending passers-by screaming and a mother diving under a car with her baby, friends and neighbors remembered Miss Vargas as a kind and gentle person who helped her father with chores around the nine-story red brick apartment building at 202 Riverside Drive, where he worked as the superintendent.  A Love of Children</p>
        <p>"She was a very nice person," said Mark Roberts, a longtime resident of the building. "We went to Joan of Arc Junior High School together. She was very conscientious and helped around the building. She was also good with children. She used to give presents to all of the children in the building."</p>
        <p>Miss Vargas was not married and had no children, said her nephew, Pedro Vargas, who is a meat manager for a D'Agostino grocery store. She was born in Puerto Rico and her body will be returned there for burial, he said.</p>
        <p>Miss Vargas, who taught part time, moved into the Riverside Drive building in 1966, three years after her father, Jose, became superintendent, and spent a lot of her free time helping him with chores, including cleaning and painting, the nephew said.</p>
        <p>Miss Vargas's brother, Raymond Vargas Santiago, was with his sister when she was seized. At a news conference at his home yesterday evening, Mr. Santiago said, "Bonnie was a nice person who loved children, especially retarded children. Every time she saw a retarded child, she would go over and help them. In school, they always gave her the bad kids because she knew how to handle them." Tears From Neighbors</p>
        <p>He added, "If someone was sick in the building, she went out of her way to see if they needed anything from the store or if they needed any help."</p>
        <p>As residents returned home from work yesterday, many of them broke into tears when they heard the news. Some walked hesitantly past the door of her apartment, which was decorated with a cutout of a heart that said "Happy Valentines Day."</p>
        <p>"She was one of the nicest people in the building," said Bill Joseph, another neighbor. "She was always helping everybody. That's why I don't understand why it happened to her."</p>
        <p>Miss Vargas's nephew, Pedro, said she always thought of others before herself -- even at the end. "When she opened the door, he pulled her out and she screamed, 'Shut the door. Shut the door!,' " he said. "She didn't want anyone else to get hurt. That's when the guy dragged her by the neck."</p>
