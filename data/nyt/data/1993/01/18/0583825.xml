        <p>The Leo Burnett Company in Chicago has disclosed changes involving two top executives.</p>
        <p>Henry J. Feeley, 52, vice chairman and corporate director of client services, will retire in the spring. Mr. Feeley, who joined Burnett in 1965, was chairman of Leo Burnett International until taking his current position on Jan. 1, 1992. He assumed the client-service duties previously handled by Hall Adams Jr., who retired as Burnett's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>A Burnett spokesman said no successor to Mr. Feeley would be named and his duties would be assumed by other top executives.</p>
        <p>Separately, James M. Jenness, executive vice president and worldwide client services director on Burnett's Kellogg account, was promoted to the new position of vice chairman and director of multinational accounts. Mr. Jenness, 46, will retain his responsibilities on the cereal maker's account, in addition to other worldwide clients.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Jenness's promotion, Burnett will have five vice chairmen. The others are Roger A. Haupt, 45, chief financial officer; John J. Smith, 54, deputy chief creative officer, and Albert C. M. Winninghoff, 50, director of corporate planning.</p>
