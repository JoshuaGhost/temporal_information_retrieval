        <p>A Federal district judge in Ohio has blocked the owners of the nation's newest hazardous-waste incinerator from conducting a series of tests that would lead to full commercial operation later this year.</p>
        <p>Judge Ann Aldridge of Federal District Court in Cleveland issued a temporary restraining order late Friday night that barred Von Roll Inc., a Swiss company, from starting trial burning at its incinerator in East Liverpool, Ohio, on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed by the Government Accountability Project, a public interest legal group in Washingon acting on behalf of residents of the Ohio Valley and the environmental group Greenpeace. The group has also managed to block, at least temporarily, the incineration of toxic wastes in a project approved by Gov. Bill Clinton at an abandoned pesticide factory in Jacksonville, Ark.</p>
        <p>In the East Liverpool case, the group had unsuccessfully sought an injunction in November from a Federal district judge in West Virginia, Frederick Stamp, who had been handling the case. It then turned to Judge Aldridge, who will hold another hearing on Friday to determine whether to lift her order or issue a permanent injunction.</p>
        <p>Her decision simultaneously ends the Bush Administration's efforts to license the $160 million Von Roll incinerator and gives the incoming President and Vice President the first test of how they will balance their goals of reducing threats to the environment and rebuilding the economy. The outcome of the struggle in East Liverpool could also provide an early indication of the influence of Vice President-elect Al Gore on such issues. Mr. Gore has voiced skepticism about the safety of incineration.</p>
        <p>The Von Roll incinerator, if approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, would burn 60,000 tons of chemical wastes a year as one of the largest of the 53 commercial hazardous-waste incinerators in operation in the United States. The plant, the first industrial site built in the upper Ohio Valley in a generation, would employ 125 people and generate $4 million a year in property, income and sales taxes for the city and the state, Von Roll executives say.</p>
        <p>"This is exactly what Clinton and Gore had in mind when they talked about new environmental industries and new jobs," Jeffrey R. Zelik, the 36-year-old manager of Von Roll, said in a telephone interview today. "A signal to delay or shut this plant down would certainly discourage investment in any industrial facility because none of them -- auto plants, steel plants, chemical plants -- would have lower emissions than ours."</p>
        <p>But the incinerator's location near the center of one of East Liverpool's most populated neighborhoods and in a region known for its dirty air has prompted protests. Opponents worry that the plant will release thousands of pounds of hazardous pollutants, though operators say the material will be safely dispersed by the air. Last month, following up on a campaign promise, Mr. Gore directed the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, to examine how Von Roll acquired its construction permits from the E.P.A.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also asked the Bush Administration to delay issuing the company a permit for trial burning until the investigation was completed. The Bush Administration, however, has insisted that the incinerator is safe, and on Jan. 8, the E.P.A. approved the trial.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the plant said they hoped Mr. Gore would intervene and withdraw the approval for the incinerator's trials. "This is really a test for what kind of Vice President he will make," said Sandra Estel, who lives with her husband and five children in a house less than 1,000 feet from the incinerator. "Was this a real campaign promise or does it mean he used this issue just to get elected?"</p>
        <p>The interest in the incinerator at the top levels of the Government also attracted the attention of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.</p>
        <p>Last week, at a hearing on the nomination of Carol M. Browner to be the next E.P.A. Administrator, two Democratic members of the panel, Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio and Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, expressed concern about the safety of the incinerator and asked Ms. Browner what she would do with Von Roll's application for a permit for full commercial operation. Ms. Browner said she would wait until the Congressional investigation was completed in February or March before making a decision.</p>
