        <p>Playing the stock market so far in the 90's has been like taking a ride on Coney Island's famous Cyclone roller-coaster. Stock funds in 1990 suffered a 7.3 percent loss on average, only to attain a return of 30.7 percent in '91 and then skid last year to a gain of just 6 percent.</p>
        <p>But even that small return didn't come until the end of the year. The stock market was flat most of 1992, nervously waiting to learn who would next occupy the White House, and only bounded up in November and December on post-election euphoria.</p>

        <p>Playing the stock market so far in the 90's has been like taking a ride on Coney Island's famous Cyclone roller-coaster. Stock funds in 1990 suffered a 7.3 percent loss on average, only to attain a return of 30.7 percent in '91 and then skid last year to a gain of just 6 percent.</p>
        <p>But even that small return didn't come until the end of the year. The stock market was flat most of 1992, nervously waiting to learn who would next occupy the White House, and only bounded up in November and December on post-election euphoria.</p>
        <p>In another abrupt turn, the market finally began favoring undervalued stocks over growth companies and funds that invest in smaller companies bested their blue-chip cousins for the second year in a row.</p>
        <p>Funds that invest in shares of small companies, by far the riskiest group of major stock funds, led that pack with a 12.5 percent return, according to Lipper Analytical Services in Summit, N.J. Next in line were equity-income funds, with a 9.4 percent return, and growth-and-income funds, 8.6 percent, both of which own high-dividend stocks or bonds that lift their returns.</p>
        <p>Among specialty funds, the 14 financial services funds, which invest in banks, brokerages, insurance companies and the like, continued their strong run, landing first place in that category with a remarkable 35.3 percent return. Other winners were science and technology, 13.5 percent, and real estate, 12.8 percent. Stodgy utilities funds also shone, at 9.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Starring among hybrid funds were the convertible securities funds, boasting a 13.6 percent return. Other funds that own a mix of stocks and bonds performed about the same as all-stock ones. Balanced funds showed a return of 7.2 percent and asset-allocation funds had a 7.5 percent return.</p>
        <p>Despite the European currency crisis last fall and other instability abroad, funds that invest in gold, which is fast losing its reputation as a refuge from international turmoil, showed a 14.6 percent loss. Other losers were the health-and-biotechnology funds -- 1991's biggest gainers -- with an 8.3 percent loss, and environmental funds, a 6.2 percent loss.</p>
        <p>For the fourth consecutive year, America was the best place to invest, with major stock funds returning 8.9 percent. The international funds as a group lost 5.1 percent. Because of a stock market scandal and continuing political and economic problems in Japan, funds that invest there were the year's biggest losers, plunging 21.3 percent. European issues did not fare too well either, losing 8 percent. Funds in Latin America and the Pacific region were basically flat.</p>
        <p>This middle-of-the-road year for the investor looks much rosier from the perspective of the fund industry. Record-low yields in taxable money markets -- the funds yielded 3.39 percent on average for the year, according to IBC/Donoghue in Ashland, Mass. -- pushed investors into higher-risk alternatives.</p>
        <p>As a result, the industry will wind up with twelve-month net sales of roughly $185 billion, up $40 billion from the previous record set in 1986 and $66.5 billion higher than in 1991, said Dean P. Eberling, an asset management and brokerage analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>The explosive growth probably will continue if significant household money now in money market funds, certificates of deposit and bank accounts continues to flow into stock and bond funds. Any type of pro-savings legislation coming from the new Democratic administration "would be an additional positive," Mr. Eberling said.</p>
        <p>Just as hordes of first-time investors moved into mutual funds, one large recipient of their money, the short-term multi-market funds, collapsed. These funds, intended to capture high yields on government securities abroad, fell victim to the European currency crisis. When funds move into such sophisticated trading strategies or derivative securities, the results have been mainly disastrous and last year was no exception.</p>
        <p>As the fixed-income market gets more and more esoteric, "I worry that we will have more problems," said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., a mutual fund research group in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Trouble ahead could come in the form of a spike in interest rates. Most investors and fund managers haven't seen interest rates rise in years. While investors may be aware of default risk, many do not understand that prices of long-term securities, like most municipal bonds, would fall if rates rose.</p>
        <p>One portent of trouble may be that 1992 was the year of the deal in the fund industry.  Recalling that the sales of Smith Barney and Kidder Peabody came just before the 1987 stock market crash, some have suggested that such transactions are a warning of market peaks.</p>
        <p>This year, two of the biggest players in municipal bond funds changed hands: John Nuveen &amp; Company sold shares to the public and Van Kampen Merritt, a Xerox division, was sold to its management.</p>
        <p>The biggest deal of all was the acquisition of John Templeton's international mutual fund empire by Franklin Resources Inc. for $913 million.</p>
        <p>Franklin has a strong domestic fixed-income business, and its new bet on international equities, especially those culled using a value approach, may be as shrewd, some analysts say, as its original bet on bonds in the early 80's.</p>
