        <p>With Otto G. Obermaier stepping down on Monday as the United States Attorney in Manhattan, the Justice Department has appointed his chief deputy, Roger S. Hayes, to head the prestigious prosecutor's office on an interim basis.</p>
        <p>Following tradition, President Clinton is expected to nominate a replacement for a full four-year term based on the recommendation of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York.</p>
        <p>Senator Moynihan's screening committee, headed by Judah Gribetz, is interviewing about a dozen candidates in preparation for making its recommendation to the Senator. Mr. Gribetz said yesterday that he hoped to complete the screening process within a few weeks.</p>
        <p>Senate confirmation of the President's nominee could take months while Mr. Hayes serves as the interim United States Attorney.</p>
