        <p>A vigorous overseas acquisition campaign is paying off for the Procter &amp; Gamble Company.</p>
        <p>The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant said yesterday that net income in its second quarter ended Dec. 31 rose nearly 13 percent, to $590 million, or 83 cents a share, from $523 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
        <p>"International earnings were up strongly on solid volume gains," Edwin L. Artzt, the company's chairman, said in a statement. "U.S. earnings were also up as a result of an improved volume trend capped by record shipments in December."</p>
        <p>For the quarter, the company said revenues increased more than 4 percent, to $7.84 billion from $7.51 billion.</p>
        <p>"Sales were a little lower than we anticipated, but thank goodness for good unit volume growth overseas, where they have been blanketing the Continent," said Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst at Morgan Stanley &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>In large part because of acquisitions, P.&amp; G.'s unit volume rose 14 percent in Europe in the quarter, Ms. Landry said, and by 11 percent worldwide. Unit sales in the United States were basically flat, she added.</p>
