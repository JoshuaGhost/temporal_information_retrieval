        <p>A Brooklyn man on parole for an attempted-robbery conviction was charged yesterday in a series of sexual assaults and robberies at a Bedford-Stuyvesant housing project.</p>
        <p>Darryle Williams of 606 Park Avenue, Bedford-Stuyvesant, was charged yesterday in 11 attacks on women at the Sumner Houses, said Amanita Duga-Carroll, a spokeswoman for the housing police. The victims, who ranged in age from 8 to 62, were stalked, robbed and, in six cases, raped or sodomized in attacks beginning last June, the police said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, who also used the name James Coleman, was arrested at 2:30 A.M. Tuesday after a woman complained to two New York City police officers that a man had stolen her bicycle and threatened her with a gun, Ms. Duga-Carroll said. Soon after, the officers found a man on Pulaski Street between Reid and Stuyvesant Avenues, she said.</p>
        <p>After hearing a description of the suspect over the police radio, four housing police officers went to that corner and summoned detectives, Ms. Duga-Carroll said.</p>
        <p>"We had extensive lineups that had to be viewed by about a dozen victims last night and this morning," Ms. Duga-Carroll said. "The arrest was not only a relief for people who live in Sumner Houses, but it was an example of very good police work."</p>
        <p>At first the police were searching for what they believed to be three men because the descriptions provided by the victims of the attacker differed markedly. "But if you look at him, he fits the three descriptions," Ms. Duga-Carroll said. Mr. Williams lives at Marcy Houses, less than a mile from Sumner Houses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams has been convicted of at least three other robberies, said Vincent Pizzo, the housing police Chief of Detectives. In the most recent conviction, he pleaded guilty on March 27, 1990, to third-degree attempted robbery and was sentenced to three to six years. He was released on parole Jan. 31, 1992, Chief Pizzo said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams was charged yesterday with eight counts of first-degree robbery, seven counts of first-degree sodomy, two counts of first-degree rape and several lesser charges.</p>
