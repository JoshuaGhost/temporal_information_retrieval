        <p>Responding quickly to new projections of larger deficits from President Bush, President-elect Bill Clinton appeared today to back off his campaign pledge to cut the Federal budget deficit in half in four years.</p>

        <p>Responding quickly to new projections of larger deficits from President Bush, President-elect Bill Clinton appeared today to back off his campaign pledge to cut the Federal budget deficit in half in four years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said the Bush Administration had camouflaged the magnitude of the deficit.</p>
        <p>In Little Rock, Ark., Mr. Clinton said the new figures, issued today by the White House as part of Mr. Bush's final budget, were an "unsettling revelation." But in the campaign, Mr. Clinton was repeatedly told by his advisers that the deficit would be larger than acknowledged by Mr. Bush or assumed by Mr. Clinton in his campaign manifesto. Billions and More Billions</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton and his aides seemed to be using the new estimates of the deficit from the Bush White House to begin revising Mr. Clinton's campaign promises. The Clinton stance also suggested the possibility that the President-elect wanted to lay early political groundwork for unpopular measures to cut the growth of spending, or even perhaps to raise some taxes.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Clinton said that he still wanted to halve the deficit, but that it would probably take more than four years to achieve that goal. "It would be imprudent to go too far on deficit reduction so you put the economy in a tailspin," said a member of Mr. Clinton's transition team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's budget for the fiscal year 1994, which begins Oct. 1, shows Federal spending of $1.5 trillion, equal to nearly one-fourth of the nation's total output of goods and services. It shows a deficit of $292.4 billion in 1994, rising to $305 billion in 1997.</p>
        <p>By contrast, in his last report to Congress, in July, Mr. Bush said the budget deficit would decline to $274.2 billion in 1994 and to $236.7 billion in 1997. The new estimate of the 1997 deficit is $68 billion higher than the estimate made by the White House five months ago. The actual deficit for the fiscal year 1992, which ended three months ago, was $290.2 billion, a record. Both Sides Vulnerable</p>
        <p>"We now can see the full magnitude of the debt we will inherit and the challenge that we must confront," Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>It was not clear how far Republicans would go in asserting that Mr. Clinton was embracing a weak excuse for softening his promise. They could argue that since the $68 billion discrepancy is far short of half the projected deficit, learning of it today is insufficient reason to back away from the pledge. If they did, Democrats would counter with examples of number-juggling by the departing Administration -- as indeed they were already doing today.</p>
        <p>The projected deficits for 1995 and beyond are higher than previous estimates by the White House, but are still based on the unrealistic assumption that spending for a wide range of domestic programs will be frozen in the next five years, with no allowance for inflation.</p>
        <p>Unpublished estimates by the Office of Management and Budget show that if these programs are allowed to grow with inflation, there will be much larger deficits, around $400 billion a year in 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>Publication of the new budget figures by the Republican Administration, and the swift response by the Democrats, echoed their debates in the 1992 campaign and foreshadowed battles over the economy.</p>
        <p>Democrats have suggested for some time that the Bush Administration deliberately underestimates the deficit, while Republicans have long charged that Democrats offer a far more expensive slate of programs than the nation can afford.</p>
        <p>The White House had suggested that Mr. Bush's final budget would be a dull, routine, apolitical exercise by a lame-duck Administration. In fact, the budget set off a political brawl over the nation's fiscal problems, with a skirmish over the candor of Mr. Bush and his budget director, Richard G. Darman. Of Circles and Squares</p>
        <p>Democrats described Mr. Darman's work as duplicitous, bizarre, unrealistic and fanciful. They said that he had understated the amount by which Federal spending and the budget deficit will grow in coming years, and had therefore understated the problems bequeathed to Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>In a separate chapter of the budget, which reads almost as if the 1992 election had not occurred, Mr. Darman boasts about the performance of the economy and mocks some of Mr. Clinton's proposals.</p>
        <p>Referring to the economy, a decisive issue in the 1992 election, Mr. Darman says dryly, "Growth has not been as strong as one would have wished." Employment, retail sales, industrial production, personal income and consumer confidence are all rising, Mr. Darman says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman describes Mr. Clinton's vision for America as "a circle that cannot be squared," and declares, "The math does not work."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, in a book-length version of his campaign manifesto, published in September, said, "Our plan will cut the deficit in half within four years."</p>
        <p>But today Mr. Clinton said: "The unsettling revelation -- however camouflaged -- is that the projected deficit for 1997 has grown by $60 billion, and that, if left unchecked, it could soar above $400 billion near the end of the decade. This sounds the final warning bell. This endless pattern of rising deficits must stop."  Leery in Little Rock</p>
        <p>In Little Rock, George Stephanopoulos, Mr. Clinton's communications director, was repeatedly asked whether, in view of the new numbers, the President-elect would carry out his pledge to cut the deficit in half in four years. Mr. Stephanopoulos offered noncommittal answers:</p>
        <p>"I think we have to address those challenges of the budget deficit and the investment deficit."</p>
        <p>"These numbers show that the defict is far worse than anyone has been telling us for a long, long time."</p>
        <p>"What this shows is that the numbers are different from what we heard during the campaign, but we are still committed to achieving reductions in the budget deficit." 'A Confusing Irrelevance'?</p>
        <p>Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Budget Committee, said Mr. Darman had used bookkeeper's gimmicks to obscure the problems facing Mr. Clinton. Of the document issued today by the White House, Mr. Sasser said: "It's not a budget. It's an irrelevance. And it's a confusing irrelevance at that."</p>
        <p>But Republicans said Mr. Clinton's estimates were also unrealistic. "It's obvious Clinton's plan won't cut the budget deficit in half," said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, ranking Republican on the Budget Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's final budget offers sobering projections for some of the Government's solemn commitments:</p>
        <p>*Outlays for Social Security will rise 39 percent, to $396 billion in 1998 from $285 billion in 1992.</p>
        <p>*The cost of Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, will double in six years, to $236 billion in 1998 from $116 billion in 1992.</p>
        <p>*Federal spending on Medicaid, for low-income people, will more than double, to $156 billion in 1998 from $68 billion in 1992.</p>
        <p>*Interest payments on the Federal debt will rise 55 percent, to $308 billion in 1998 from $199 billion last year. The debt itself, the accumulated total of all Federal borrowing, will rise more rapidly, to $4.8 trillion in 1998 from $3 trillion last year.</p>
        <p>Ronald Reagan's last budget, sent to Congress in January 1989, and Mr. Bush's first budget, in January 1990, both said that the Federal budget deficit would be eliminated by now. They projected modest surpluses for 1993, 1994 and 1995. A Perfunctory Letter</p>
        <p>There is no evidence that Mr. Bush played a significant role in decisions about the budget document published today. The President's Budget Message is a perfunctory letter to Congress; the contents of the document come from Mr. Darman and his staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman suggested today that Mr. Clinton had taken the idea of "investing in America's future" from prior Bush budgets. If Mr. Clinton really cares about such investments, Mr. Darman said, he will "slow the growth of the consumption portion of the Federal budget" by limiting the growth of Federal benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Darman called again for a limit on the growth of such programs, under which benefits are available to all applicants who meet certain eligibility criteria. Those programs grow automatically under existing law because of inflation, population growth, the aging of the population and other factors.</p>
        <p>The proposed limit on the growth of Federal benefit programs, also known as entitlement programs, would save $15 billion in 1994 and a total of $358 billion from 1994 through 1998, by Mr. Darman's calculations. The White House did not specify how those savings should be achieved. Far more modest proposals to trim Medicare, farm subsidies, student loans and other forms of largess have provoked an uproar on Capitol Hill.</p>
