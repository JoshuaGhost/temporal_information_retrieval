        <p>IF wine with food was a preoccupation in the 80's, beer with food -- and not just hot dogs or pizza -- is attracting attention now.</p>
        <p>The choices of what to drink with a fine dinner now include pale, amber and dark beers as well as red and white wines, as the interest grows in well-made, flavorful beers from small American regional breweries. Some lesser-known beers from Belgium, Germany and other countries are also popular.</p>
        <p>While these beers still represent a tiny fraction of the total beer consumption in this country, sales are increasing rapidly, up 40 percent last year over 1991.  Total beer sales rose only 3 percent nationwide in the same period. Bland commercial beers slake more thirst in summer than at this time of year, but complex and assertively flavored beers are often more inviting with winter's heartier foods.</p>
        <p>On a recent evening at Nosmo King, a small restaurant in TriBeCa that has three beers on tap and 20 or so in bottles, the chef, Alan Harding, devised a six-course beer-tasting menu, something he does regularly at customers' request.</p>
        <p>Among the dishes was a spice-infused Thai mushroom broth with smoked rabbit dumplings that was felicitously paired with a slightly astringent Harpoon Golden Lager from Boston. A rich ragout of moulard duck and root vegetables went beautifully with a full-bodied porter made by Yuengling &amp; Son of Pottsville, Pa.</p>
        <p>"I'm trained to make soigne food," Mr. Harding said, "so I automatically think in terms of wine. But now that I am also doing beer dinners, I have been surprised to discover how well so many dishes go with beer."</p>
        <p>He has even found that foods like sauteed tuna with spinach or foie gras, which are not necessarily associated with beer, marry well with many full-bodied beers.</p>
        <p>Samichlaus, a dark, chocolate-scented Swiss beer brewed only in December, was probably a better match for his chocolate bread pudding than any wine. There are other foods, among them artichokes and pickled dishes like ceviche, that are friendlier toward a lager or pale ale than they are to wine.</p>
        <p>Many new restaurants in New York have beer lists. Brasserie des Theatres in the theater district and Brasserie Pascal near Lincoln Center offer a variety of beers and Alsatian dishes to go with them. The restaurant One Fifth Avenue now has a list of 13 beers.</p>
        <p>At Vong, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's month-old Thai restaurant in midtown Manhattan, there are 22 beers from 11 countries ranging in price from $3.50 to $10 a bottle. "Some of them need to be explained," Mr. Vongerichten said. But as a result of the popularity of beer, he continued, he is planning to add more beers at Jo Jo, his other restaurant in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Established restaurants like the American Festival Cafe in Rockefeller Center, the Mansion on Turtle Creek in Dallas and the Berghoff in Chicago offer many beers. The American Festival Cafe now even changes its list seasonally.</p>
        <p>Some places known for their well-stocked wine cellars, like Windows on the World in Manhattan; the Frenchtown Inn in Frenchtown, N.J., and the American Hotel in Sag Harbor, L.I., are organizing beer dinners, adding special beer lists and training waiters to assist customers in ordering beer.</p>
        <p>"When we saw how successful the beer dinners were, we knew immediately that interesting beers had a following," said Johannes Tromp, the director of Windows on the World.</p>
        <p>Beer-tasting events have been sellouts. For the last three years, the American Institute of Wine and Food in New York has held gatherings at which guests could sample 30 or more beers and learn about them. Smaller versions of this tasting have been held at the Little Shop of Hops, a brewing-supply store in midtown.</p>
        <p>Restaurants called brew pubs, where beer is made fresh on the premises, have opened in many cities. The Goose Island Brewing Company in Chicago, the Dock Street Brewing Company in Philadelphia and Zip City in Manhattan are among them. These places serve a variety of foods, from sandwiches to grilled tuna to dishes with lusty spices, to complement the beers. There are many brew pubs even in the wine country of Northern California, Oregon and Washington.</p>
        <p>The demand for these beers is a result of people seeking alternatives to bland mass-produced beers or to a market in which only imports were considered to be of high quality. Beer makers who saw a challenge in trying to fill the void have come up with stylish, well-made products.</p>
        <p>Beer making was a thriving regional industry decades ago, but it began to suffer as small breweries were bought by big ones or could not survive the competition. The industry's revival dates roughly from 1965, when Fritz Maytag bought and reinvented Anchor Steam Beer in San Francisco. The first micro-brewery, one that usually makes less than 20,000 barrels a year, was New Albion, which opened in Sonoma, Calif., in 1977.</p>
        <p>Today, there are nearly 400 micro-breweries and brew pubs nationwide. Contract brewers like F. X. Matt in Utica, N.Y., which make small batches of regional beers under a variety of labels, are busier than ever, bottling everything from light lagers to extra-strong syrupy stouts.</p>
        <p>Prices for boutique beers and the better imports are generally more than $1 for a 12-ounce bottle and can be $5 or even more. Mass-produced beers cost much less.</p>
        <p>Like most wines, beers are very forgiving when it comes to serving them with food. Generally, a well-made beer that is not too assertive will suit a wide range of dishes.</p>
        <p>As Americans learn more about beer, a certain snobbery is probably inevitable, as it was with wine. Some connoisseurs will be preoccupied with issues like using the proper glass, finding the right beer to serve with salmis of baby pheasant or knowing whether a beer was made with Cascade or Styrian Goldings hops.</p>
        <p>While this trivia may intimidate some Budweiser drinkers who are thinking of trying Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, it still may give beer some much-needed cachet. As Mr. Harding said, "Beer with a good dinner is no longer a low-class choice, and that's what we're now beginning to understand." Red Cabbage In Beer and Cider</p>
        <p>(Adapted from "Real Beer and Good Eats" by Bruce Aidells and Denis Kelly; Alfred A. Knopf, 1992)</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 hour  4 tablespoons butter  2 1/2 pounds red cabbage (about 1 medium head), cored and shredded  1/2medium onion, sliced thin  3 large Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored and halved  2 tablespoons cider vinegar  1 tablespoon sugar  1/3 cup chicken stock  3 bay leaves  1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper  1/2 teaspoon caraway seeds  6 ounces dark beer  1/2 cup fresh apple cider  Salt to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Melt butter in a large, heavy pot over medium-low heat. Add cabbage and onion. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until cabbage is wilted, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. While cabbage is cooking, grate apples and mix with the vinegar. When cabbage has wilted, add grated apples and all remaining ingredients, seasoning the mixture sparingly with salt.</p>
        <p>3. Cook uncovered, stirring from time to time, until cabbage is tender, about 30 minutes. Remove bay leaves and add more salt if necessary. Serve at once or refrigerate and reheat the next day.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 side-dish servings, good with amber or dark lager.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving:</p>
        <p>160 calories, 8 grams fat, 20 milligrams cholesterol, 95 milligrams sodium (before salting), 2 grams protein, 25 grams carbohydrate.  Chocolate Bread Pudding  (Adapted from Alan Harding of Nosmo King restaurant)</p>
        <p>Total time: 2 hours  3 cups crumbled chocolate cake, an 8-by-1-inch round layer  1 cup cubed white bread  2 whole eggs  3 egg yolks  1/2 cup sugar  2 cups whole milk or half-and-half  2 tablespoons vanilla extract  3 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate, in 6 uniform chunks.</p>
        <p>1. Start preparation at least 2 hours and up to 12 hours before serving time. Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Spread cake and bread on a baking sheet and place in the oven until they dry out, 20 to 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Beat eggs, egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Stir in the milk and vanilla extract. Add dried cake and bread and allow to soak 30 minutes to 1 hour.</p>
        <p>3. Increase oven temperature to 325 degrees.</p>
        <p>4. Spoon pudding mixture into a baking dish and place dish in a larger baking dish. Place in oven and add boiling water to outside dish so it comes halfway up the sides of the inner dish. Bake 25 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool.</p>
        <p>5. When cool, coarsely cut up the pudding mixture. Divide mixture among 6 one-cup ramekins or custard cups. Bury a chunk of chocolate in middle of each. Set aside until just before serving time.</p>
        <p>6. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Bake pudding for 15 minutes. Serve at once in the ramekins. If desired, top with chocolate sauce or ice cream.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings. Good with strong stout or samichlaus ale.</p>

        <p>375 calories, 15 grams fat, 190 milligrams cholesterol, 305 milligrams sodium, 8 grams protein, 55 grams carbohydrate.</p>
        <p>Belgian-Style Mussels  (Adapted from Bradlee Bartam of the Dock Street Brewing Company)</p>
        <p>Total time: 30 minutes  1/2 pound unsalted butter, softened  1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard  1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice  1/2 teaspoon soy sauce  1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme  1 teaspoon minced fresh garlic  1 teaspoon ground allspice  1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper  5 dozen medium-size mussels, 3 to 4 pounds, scrubbed and debearded  3 cups amber beer  Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  2 teaspoons chopped parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Place all but 2 teaspoons of the butter in a mixing bowl. With a wooden spoon, work in the mustard, lemon juice, soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of the thyme and the garlic. Transfer the butter mixture to a small container and refrigerate until serving time.</p>
        <p>2. In a heavy 5-quart saucepan, melt the remaining butter over medium heat. Add the allspice, red pepper and remaining thyme and saute for 30 seconds. Stir in the mussels and cook, stirring, until they are coated with the seasoned butter. Pour in the beer.</p>
        <p>3. Cover and steam until mussels open, about 10 minutes. Divide mussels among 4 deep bowls and cover each, discarding any mussels that have not opened.</p>
        <p>4. Reheat broth and season to taste with salt and pepper. Pour broth over each serving of mussels. Top each serving with a generous dollop of the mustard butter, sprinkle with parsley and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings. Good with a pilsner.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving:</p>
        <p>605 calories, 50 grams fat, 220 milligrams cholesterol, 565 milligrams sodium (before salting), 25 grams protein, 14 grams carbohydrate. Good Pairs</p>
        <p>BEERS run the gamut from light, refreshing lagers, pilsners and pale ales, to richer amber beers and ales and strong, heavy dark bock beers, stouts and porters. Within this range of colors and styles, beers can be fruity, aromatic, dry, bitter and even chocolatey. Some beers are flavored with fruit, herbs and spices.</p>
        <p>The more malted barley there is in the mash used to make the beer, the fruitier the beer. Darker beers are heavy and tend to have more sweetness. Ales are typically more complex than lagers. Except for the pleasing bitterness usually found in beers that are made with more hops, much of the beer-tasting vocabulary is similar to that of wine.</p>
        <p>Pairing foods with beer is a matter of balance. With lighter foods, lighter-bodied beers tend to be better; richer, heavier dishes call for beers with more substance. Highly spiced foods are best with light to amber beers. Fried foods call for beers with some bitterness or astringency.</p>
        <p>And just as there are some seemingly peculiar but classic combinations of food and wine, like Roquefort cheese with sweet Sauternes, there are also some for beer, notably fresh oysters with a dark stout like Guinness. The intensity of the stout enhances the briny, somewhat metallic flavor of fine cold-water oysters.</p>
        <p>Here are some suggestions for pairing beers and foods. Except for intensely flavored dark beers, most beers complement a variety of dishes.</p>
        <p>* Light lagers, pilsners, pale ales, wheat beers (weissbiers): smoked salmon, most steamed or grilled seafood, pickled seafood, sushi, tempura, most dishes in broth, quiche, chicken, fish or pasta in cream sauce, mild cheeses, choucroute garni, salads in vinaigrette, Cantonese food, light but spicy Thai and Vietnamese food.</p>
        <p>* Amber beers, amber ales, light porters: onion soup, boiled beef, grilled chicken, pates, smoked meats, meat salads, pasta with meat or rich tomato sauce, pizza, choucroute garni, grilled meats, barbecue, most cheeses and most Mexican, Cajun, Indian, Sichuan and Hunan food.</p>
        <p>* Stouts, dark porters, dark beers, bock beers, dunkels, Belgian Trappist ales: raw oysters, grilled mushrooms, game meats, rich stews, sweet and sour meats, duck, steak, sharp cheeses, spice cakes.</p>
        <p>* Fruit ales, most lambic ales, strong stouts, holiday and winter beers: very rich dishes, chocolate and spice-flavored desserts.</p>
