        <p>Nearly two years ago, Felix S. Bloch and his wife, Lucille, moved into the Governors Club, a private residential and golfing community just south of here, in search of peace and quiet.</p>
        <p>The former Foreign Service officer was also in search of relative anonymity after the tumultuous ending to his 32-year career with the State Department.</p>
        <p>In November 1990, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d dismissed him from his post in the department's Bureau of European and Canadian Affairs in Washington under suspicions that he had spied for the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Bloch has encountered problems again. Over the last weekend, he was arrested at a supermarket here where he worked as a cashier and bagger. He was charged with "larceny by employee."</p>
        <p>Bobby Leesnitzer, the manager of Harris-Teeter Supermarket in University Mall, notified the police on Sunday evening, but he declined to give details today. The police say Mr. Bloch was reported to have been seen loading bags of groceries, worth about $100, into his silver 1980 Mercedes-Benz.</p>
        <p>On Monday morning, the 57-year-old Mr. Bloch, a former top United States diplomat at the embassy in Vienna, posted a $1,000 bond and was released.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloch has not commented, just as he had declined to be interviewed since his identity was learned by reporters in this area.</p>
        <p>Since moving here, Mr. Bloch has worked at two jobs: one at the supermarket and one as a city bus driver.</p>
        <p>"He works very hard, long hours," said Henry Mattox, a retired Foreign Service officer who lives here and has spoken occasionally to Mr. Bloch. But now he has hit a "very bad patch," Mr. Mattox said.</p>
        <p>"He is not a person who talks very freely," said Mr. Mattox.</p>
        <p>What little is known about Mr. Bloch's current life has come from Mr. Mattox, who describes himself as a "longtime acquaintance," although the two did not serve together in their Foreign Service careers.  Considered a Colleague</p>
        <p>There are about two or three dozen former Foreign Service officers in the Chapel Hill vicinity, Mr. Mattox said, and "most of them have accepted him as a Foreign Service colleague."</p>
        <p>"There is an informal gathering, an informal club, and he has mixed with his Foreign Service colleagues to a limited degree," he said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Bloch and his wife bought their home in Governors Club in April 1991 it was assessed for tax purposes at $169,000, which is below its market value. It is relatively modest for the area, where most homes were designed to sell for $300,000 to $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mattox suggested that unlike most Foreign Service retirees in the area Mr. Bloch has had to work and has not been able to enjoy many leisure or academic and professional pursuits.</p>
        <p>In 1989, Federal investigators said they photographed Mr. Bloch passing a briefcase to a K.G.B. agent in Paris. Mr. Bloch has said he was trading sheets of stamps with a fellow collector.</p>
        <p>He was never arrested or charged, but he lost his job and retirement pay.</p>
        <p>Before his dismissal, he was suspended without pay for several months from a State Department job that paid $81,400 a year. He was the first American diplomat to be disciplined on espionage-related accusations since a low-ranking officer was convicted of passing documents in Warsaw in 1961.</p>
        <p>He has never contested any of the actions against him, but neither has he explained why he did not.</p>
