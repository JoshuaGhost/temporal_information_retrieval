        <p>WHEN President-elect Bill Clinton spent part of his Thanksgiving holiday enjoying some R &amp; R at the Huntington Hotel in Pasadena -- attending a birthday party given by the television producer Linda Bloodworth-Thomason and ordering room service pizza at 3 A.M. -- he brought unexpected attention to one of Southern California's better kept hostelry secrets. Indeed, the 86-year-old Huntington, one of the region's more storied resort hotels, is frequently overlooked by Angelenos who, as a rule, tend to spend weekends at the beach in the summer and the desert in the winter.</p>
        <p>Pasadena, about 25 miles inland from the Pacific and perhaps best known for its annual Tournament of Roses Parade on New Year's Day (and this month Super Bowl XXVII), tends to be ignored the rest of the year. Yet, this anonymity wasn't always the case. Indeed, the Huntington, now under the management of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company, had originally been a fashionable winter resort. When Henry Huntington, a wealthy Pasadena resident, bought the Hotel Wentworth in 1911, renamed and expanded it, including the installation of a pool, the Huntington became a popular November-to-May watering hole where Easterners and Midwesterners could hobnob with Hollywood royalty while acquiring out-of-season tans.</p>
        <p>Eventually the hotel fell on hard times. During World War II, it even served as an Army hospital. Subsequently, three decades of ownership by Sheraton did little to counter the fact that the Huntington existed primarily as picturesque evidence of a bygone era. By 1985, the hotel was shuttered when it failed to meet state building codes for earthquake damage.</p>
        <p>In 1987 it was bought by a local partnership. A $100 million, three-year project that required the demolition of everything but two of the hotel's original ballrooms, attempted not only to return the Huntington to its historic splendor but also to remake it into a year-round luxury resort.</p>
        <p>As a relatively new resident of Southern California, I cannot speak to the hotel's pre-Ritz condition. Residents, however, invariably describe it as "old." My first impression upon sighting the imposing Palladian-style structure as I drove onto the hotel's circular driveway during a weekend visit late last summer was of steeped-in-tradition luxury. With its soaring red-tile roof crowned by fluttering flags, its velvety lawns and backdrop of the San Gabriel Mountains, the Huntington fits easily into that grand tradition of the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs or the Mount Washington Hotel in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>That sense of time-honored elegance quickly gave way, however, to more modern sensations of speed and efficiency. Barely was my car in park, when it was rushed by a phalanx of very young, very eager men dressed in white shorts and sneakers who flung open the doors, stripped the car of its luggage and whisked me and my companion into the lobby with the efficiency of ball boys clearing the Stadium Court at the United States Open. Our introduction to the Huntington almost made up in youthful good intentions what it lacked in graciousness and style. It was also a harbinger of the whole weekend.</p>
        <p>Indeed, what we encountered during our Friday-to-Sunday stay was a sparkling resort that married a historically correct old-world facade with modern luxury hotel appointments. All of the Huntington's 385 guest rooms and suites are oversized and outfitted with marble bathrooms, sitting areas, two telephones, remote-control color television and minibars. The hotel also offers two restaurants, (the luxury Georgian Room was closed to the public as of the first of this year; it is used only for private functions), 24-hour room service, twice-daily maid service as well as a fitness center, three lighted tennis courts, a whirlpool bath and the restored outdoor swimming pool. The hotel's common areas, whose standard-issue, 10-foot ceilings are one of the few telltale signs of the structural overhaul, are furnished with a tasteful Ralph Laurenish decor of Oriental carpets, crystal chandeliers, potted palms in Chinese vases and plenty of reproduction English mahogany furniture.</p>
        <p>Our room, No. 268, at the hotel's rear as I requested, was a haven of serenity. A spacious corner unit with five windows overlooking the rolling lawn, the room was decorated in a crisp Federal style with dusty blue and cream tones. By the time we arrived in the early evening, the bed had already been turned down for the night. The lamps were lighted, classical music wafted from the clock radio, and a bottle of wine was chilling in an ice bucket. The room also contained a desk, two chairs and a comfortable armchair and ottoman. An armoire housed the television and minibar. The bathroom, a palatially sized sanctuary of white and gray marble and gleaming chrome, included a large tub and a separate glass-doored shower. There were plenty of thick white towels bearing the Ritz-Carlton's blue lion logo. A cut-glass tray contained the usual bath amenities. Although the regular rate for this room was $220, we were paying $119 a night for a summer weekend package. While we later visited suites on the hotel's seventh and eighth floors -- four-poster beds, separate sitting rooms and a second bathroom -- none of them struck us as cozier or significantly better appointed than our room. Only the Huntington's freestanding cottages would have provided a different level of guest accommodation.</p>
        <p>The six cottages are on the far reaches of the hotel's 23 acres and ostensibly offer a greater level of privacy than a room in the main building. All of the units, however, contain at least two one-bedroom suites sharing a common entryway and facing a residential street -- an arrangement that contributes to a rather condominium-like atmosphere for a grand hotel.</p>
        <p>As well-appointed as the hotel is physically, our visit -- two years after the hotel reopened under Ritz-Carlton management -- did reveal some drawbacks. The Huntington is largely manned with a less-than-experienced, although well-meaning, young staff. Also, the hotel's emphasis on large groups like wedding receptions and conventions as well as public memberships for the pool and tennis courts ultimately detracts from the usual standards set by luxury hotels.</p>
        <p>In fact, it was our sneaker-shod bellman who casually alerted us to the occasional pandemonium at the Huntington. "Good thing you folks didn't check in at 3 P.M.," he said, pushing our luggage down the hallway. "We were totally swamped with about 300 conventioneers checking out."</p>
        <p>INDEED, the hotel can frequently seem crowded with nonguests. On Saturday afternoon we had to fight our way into the pool when the neighborhood klatsch of Pasadena residents holding family pool memberships convened. On a stroll about the Huntington a few weeks before our weekend visit, I had found the common areas overflowing with two wedding parties as well as several hundred real-estate agents attending a private poolside reception.</p>
        <p>The private visitor, particularly one paying high-season rates, would do well to inquire whether any major conventions are being held at the hotel or request a Ritz-Carlton Club room, which, for a higher tariff, puts the guests on a secluded, key-access floor featuring a private lounge with its own concierge.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the disparity between the Huntington's refurbished grand hotel style and a slightly dizzy, summer-camp ambiance proved to be the signature of the weekend. During our stay -- which included meals in two of the hotel restaurants, a room-service breakfast and visits to the fitness center, pool, bar and lobby lounge -- I don't believe we encountered a single staff person over the age of thirtysomething. Some of that youthfulness was charming in a California-casual kind of way. Our lunchtime waitress at the pool bar was delightfully insouciant and the overworked receptionist in the fitness center was a model of unflagging cheerfulness, even when fetching room-service coffee for guests waiting their turns on the tennis court or the Stairmaster.</p>
        <p>Other staff missteps, however, bordered on hotel-trainee behavior. For instance, our checking in was a largely bungled affair when the blazer-clad desk clerk, confused about the whereabouts of our luggage, cheerfully asked us to retrieve it from the valets outside. During dinner in the moderately priced Cafe, our waitress repeatedly offered to "freshen" our wine glasses with $18-a-glass cabernet sauvignon, a price that was easily double that of my pasta entree. Frequently, we had to reassure overly attentive and robotically polite staff members that we did not require anything except to be left to our own devices.</p>
        <p>However, dinner in The Grill, the Huntington's clubby, mid-priced restaurant, proved to be an exception.  Service on a Friday evening when the restaurant was comfortably but not overly crowded was crisp and unobtrusive, while the food -- a meat-heavy menu more appropriate to Christmas day dining than 100-degree late summer heat -- was expert. After priming our appetites with a visit to the bar, an inviting dark warren of wood paneling and overstuffed sofas, we adjourned to The Grill, where I dined a la carte on a rich tomato bisque, two perfectly seared lamb chops napped by a red wine sauce, creamed spinach and a slice of warm apple tart. My companion tucked into a plate of venision and roasted potatoes. Christmas Day dining indeed; certainly all those a la carte prices added up to a bill that had "special occasion" written all over it: $120 for two, including wine.</p>
        <p>Although Pasadena offers the visitor a number of diversions, we confined our activities to the pool, crowded as it was, the hotel bar and lobby lounge where afternoon "Pacific rim tea" (macademia nuts on the menu) is served. We could have worked out in the fitness center. But a quick visit to this Lilliputian and inexplicably non-air-conditioned gym (the center on the first floor of one of the cottage units) dissuaded us. We could also have played tennis, ridden bikes or arranged for a round of golf at a nearby course.</p>
        <p>WHEN I called room service for breakfast Sunday morning, the staff person not only read my order back to me, but also informed me, "It is now 10:15 and we will have a butler to your room by 10:30." Exactly 15 minutes later, a black-jacketed waiter arrived bearing my bran muffins and coffee.</p>
        <p>The same kind of polite accommodation greeted my request to delay the hotel's noon checkout time by an hour. When we finally did depart, strolling out of the Huntington's cool marble lobby accompanied by that flock of energetic valets, we felt that we had not only survived a beachless weekend in Los Angeles, but that we had done so with style.</p>
