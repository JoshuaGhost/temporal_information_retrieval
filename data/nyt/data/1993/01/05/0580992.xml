        <p>Pretty soon it will be two years since Saddam Hussein lost the war against the United States and the coalition it put together.</p>
        <p>We all know he lost. The President of the United States said so and anyway we all saw it and read it. Some of us wrote it.</p>
        <p>But Saddam Hussein -- he does not know it. He will not know until his dying day.</p>
        <p>He is still in power, which is one way he knows his triumph. As President Bush says his goodbyes, President Hussein reviews his troops, stands on the roof of his land and cries victory, revenge and Holy War unending.</p>
        <p>For Saddam Hussein, as for all dictators, there is one other way he can savor the victory of survival -- killing all who ever opposed him, particularly his own countrymen. He has never stopped.</p>
        <p>Why did Mr. Bush allow Saddam Hussein to remain in power, when he had him in his fist? The story that the Arabs put on pressure to save him has not been proved. Perhaps the Pentagon pressured him? How?</p>
        <p>So, in want of any other demonstrable reason, as always the simplest have to be chosen. They are two: President Bush lost his nerve or thought an Iraqi officer would put a bullet into Saddam's head.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the real reason is fuzzy even in Mr. Bush's mind by now, overlaid by regret and rationalization. That happens a lot to leaders.</p>
        <p>But there are things we do know. We cannot escape that knowledge.</p>
        <p>We know that Saddam Hussein, for years before the war, tried to wipe out the Kurdish people and culture. Kurds are non-Arab Muslims who live in several Mideast countries, among them Iraq. Their crime was that they would not submit to Saddam Hussein.</p>
        <p>So he bombed them, shelled them, gassed them. He put fire to their villages, thousands of villages.</p>
        <p>Judith Miller, in a historic article in The New York Times Magazine, reports on a mountain of evidence gathered by Kurds. The documents were brought to the U.S. by them and by Middle East Watch of New York, with American Government help -- preparation for a war crimes trial.</p>
        <p>But even without that evidence, the West knew of the killing and pillage.</p>
        <p>The Human Rights Bureau of the State Department, then headed by Richard Schifter, who would add tested courage to the Clinton administration, reported in 1989 about the use of chemical weapons and mass eviction against the Kurds -- "cleansing" it is called now.</p>
        <p>But the West then was arming Saddam, stuffing him with credits, holding him fondly forth as the hope of the Mideast, God help us. So you can see that Kurdish lives could not be considered in that grand scheme.</p>
        <p>Together, Arab governments, Western foreign offices and world journalism have created the myth that the great danger in the Mideast is the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</p>
        <p>Dangerous it is, chiefly because it is the excuse for arms buildup and hate propaganda. But so far, counted in lives, the Palestinian-Israeli dispute is a sideshow compared with Muslim slaughter of Muslims.</p>
        <p>The Iraq-Iran war of devastation. The Syrian conquest of Lebanon. Egyptians against Yemenis. The slaughter of their own countrymen by the Syrian, Iranian, Iraqi, Sudanese and Libyan Governments, and by fundamentalists of all nationalities.</p>
        <p>And now, we should know this: Saddam Hussein continues the war against the Kurds, those who survived the flight into northern Iraq. They are subject to constant military harassment and their lifelines of food and medicine are being blocked.</p>
        <p>Congress has appropriated $48 million for food and medicine. But they have to come by way of Turkey into Kurdish territory through roads controlled in part by Iraq.</p>
        <p>The U.N. has about 30 guards in the area -- not nearly enough to protect the trucks from attack and sabotage. So the Kurds suffer from a double embargo -- the U.N.'s against Iraq and Saddam's against them.</p>
        <p>They ask for help urgently. Warnings to Baghdad to stop ambushing the trucks or face air attack against Iraqi positions, plus helicopter cover for relief convoys, would do it.</p>
        <p>That will not change Saddam Hussein's goal of wiping out the Kurds. But it will allow more Kurds to live to see spring return to the mountains, and to go on fighting the man who does not know he lost the war.</p>
