        <p>The San Diego Chargers didn't want to hear any of a multitude of excuses they could embrace. Not about a glaring lack of playoff experience costing them.

        <p>The San Diego Chargers didn't want to hear any of a multitude of excuses they could embrace. Not about a glaring lack of playoff experience costing them. Not about the incessant rain at Joe Robbie Stadium today. Nor even about the fact that 16 of the last 17 American Conference playoff games have now been won by the home team.</p>
        <p>Nor did the Chargers feel a 31-0 loss, to the Miami Dolphins, is what inevitably happens when you build a 12-5 record by playing a relatively weak schedule after a fifth-place finish the year before.</p>
        <p>"We just took an old-fashioned licking -- on both sides of the ball," San Diego Coach Bobby Ross said. "Particularly, we haven't had a game like this where we were so off-sync in our throwing game." Near-Record for Futility</p>
        <p>San Diego didn't quite rival the 1958 Cleveland Browns' record for offensive futility in the National Football League playoffs -- a paltry 86 yards, against the Giants. It just seemed that way.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Stan Humphries, sacked just once but banged around much of the game, was at the center of the Chargers' offensive woes. He settled for 140 passing yards on 18 completions in 44 attempts, with 4interceptions. And San Diego totaled just 202 yards of offense.</p>
        <p>"I had one of these days you'd like to forget -- for the rest of your life," Humphries said. "I didn't throw the football well. When I did, it was to them."</p>
        <p>Of his four interceptions, he said ruefully, "The ball is in my hands a lot and I've got to take care of it better than I did."</p>
        <p>Ross had noticed Humphries's wildness before the game and noted that it carried into the game. Too Far Behind to Run</p>
        <p>With rain pelting the field, San Diego figured to rely heavily on its touted running game. It couldn't. Charger fullback Marion Butts, advertised as a threat to wear down Miami's defense, wound up with 25 yards.</p>
        <p>The visitors were averaging 4.6 yards a rush at halftime, but ran only three times in the second half.</p>
        <p>"I think we could have run for a lot more yardage," said Butts. "It's just that when they went ahead by three touchdowns, it changed the complexion of the game."</p>
        <p>The game had been touted in part as a match between Charger defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger, the former Dolphins defensive boss, and longtime Miami Coach Don Shula. Arnsparger's forces flopped against the patient Miami offense.</p>
        <p>Arnsparger, 66 years old and back in the league after a nine-year absence, was gracious in defeat. He slipped out of the San Diego locker room shortly before the news media was allowed in and visited the Dolphins' locker room to offer congratulations.</p>
        <p>"Twelve weeks I've enjoyed it," he said of his return to the N.F.L., "and six weeks I haven't." Quickness and Skill</p>
        <p>The Chargers had just nine players with playoff experience before this season -- and none with extensive experience.</p>
        <p>"I don't think we can think of an excuse here," said a somber Bobby Beathard, the team's general manager. "I think the coach did a great job of not making the playoffs sound too big to our players. And we thought the rain might help us, not hurt us."</p>
        <p>Ross said the main reason for the loss was the Miami defense.</p>
        <p>"They're an underrated defensive team," he said. "Some people say they're small, but I don't see that. They've got great quickness and they defended us with great intensity and skill. Their whole team was focused and coming off a week of rest."</p>
        <p>Ross said he asked his players in his post-game speech to remember how they felt at game's end.</p>
        <p>"I want them to remember how much it hurts. Maybe if they have a tendency to not work out as much as they should, the memory will motivate them not to let this happen again."  PRO FOOTBALL</p>
