        <p>This is where sound goes to die: The towering black roof of Byrne Meadowlands Arena, the largest segmented dome in the world.</p>
        <p>Clap, and there is no echo. Scream invectives from Section 107, and the waves travel leisurely across the basketball floor, or over the ice surface, unimpeded, unamplified, only once.</p>
        <p>A great place to watch Bruce Springsteen. A safe, functional arena for the kids. A wide concourse, with tasty cookies from Mrs. Fields. A drop-dead boring place to watch a sports event.</p>
        <p>"It's kind of a dead arena," said Chris Dudley, the Nets center who must call the place home. "If you get 12,000 people in here, it feels totally deserted. A lot like Cleveland." It's In Jersey. What Exit?</p>
        <p>For years, there have been whispers about the arena. It is too sterile. It is a tomb, a steel bump off the Exit 16W ramp of the New Jersey Turnpike. This season, though, it is worse. The local teams are losing at home, as if to prove the point.</p>
        <p>Their records shout, at earsplitting decibels, that Byrne Meadowlands Arena just might be the worst home in all of American professional sports. The Nets (7-7 at home) have a better record on the road and Devils (9-8) have virtually the same records at home and on the road, ratios that are rare in professional sports.</p>
        <p>"I can't explain it," said Scott Stevens, a defenseman for the Devils. "But we do play better on the road. Maybe we don't feel like we have to put on a show on the road to get the fans going."</p>
        <p>Geography conspires against the site. There is no sense of identity, no town, no mass transportation. It resides, simply, "five miles west of the Lincoln Tunnel." The building, dedicated to outgoing Gov. Brendan Byrne back in 1981, is still identified by a different name by almost every newspaper in the metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>The players complain about the fans, who arrive late with borrowed corporate tickets and like to root for New York teams. Herb Brooks, the coach of the Devils, hates the soundboard man who replaced the organist. The crowd doesn't seem to hate anybody quite enough, except sometimes the home team.</p>
        <p>"The fans are here to ridicule you, make a joke out of it all," said Sam Bowie, center for the Nets. "When I played in Portland, it didn't matter if I scored 2 points or 20 points. They applauded and appreciated me. Now, I walk off the floor at the half as the leading rebounder, and somebody shouts, 'Hey, Bowie, get a rebound.' "</p>
        <p>Don't pin any of this on Harry Mahler. Before the architect designed Byrne Meadowlands Arena for Grad Associates in Newark, he asked Julius Erving, a seasoned observer, what single element was most needed in a sports arena.</p>
        <p>Erving didn't mention ambience to Mahler. He didn't talk about rocking acoustics or a sense of coziness. He asked for taller shower heads.</p>
        <p>"Erving said, 'The water in these places always hits me in the navel,' " Mahler said. "So we raised the shower heads to seven feet and raised all the doors."</p>
        <p>Mahler was only trying to please. The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority and its former director, Loris Smith, wanted a multi-purpose performance space, with few ornaments. Mahler delivered. Byrne Meadowlands Arena was voted the best concert arena by Performance Magazine five times. The arena opened on July 2, 1981, with a Springsteen concert, not a basketball game. Seemingly, the priorities have never changed.</p>
        <p>"To be acoustically perfect, you want the crowd to throb and invigorate the players as they go for the tie," Mahler said. "But when Frank Sinatra sings, you want to hear every nuance. Both things go against each other." Surprise! Sinatra Won</p>
        <p>Mahler erred on the side of Sinatra. He won a national engineering award for his design. The sightlines are great, and the arena turns a tidy profit. But not everybody is happy.</p>
        <p>Norman Siminoff of Edison, N.J., became the franchise's first season ticketholder when the Nets moved to New Jersey in 1977. He had his photo taken with owner Joe Taub to prove it. When the Nets later moved from the Rutgers Athletic Center in Piscataway, N.J., to the Meadowlands in 1981, Siminoff was given a tour of the place and offered his choice of seat locations.</p>
        <p>Siminoff picked two courtside seats that would later be obscured by hockey boards and press row. Tough luck. But that isn't his only problem.</p>
        <p>"It's dead in here," Siminoff said. "I can talk to the guy up in Section 234, ask him what he thought of the last shot. The people here sit on their hands. There's no esprit de corps. Why not get a fan-o-meter in here? I always feel like a fan in an away arena."</p>
        <p>John Scher, the rock promoter from Montclair, N.J., also owns season tickets to the Nets. He can understand the dilemma that Mahler once faced.</p>
        <p>"As a concert space, it is without equal in North America, maybe only by the Palace of Auburn Hills," Scher said, referring to the Michigan arena that is home to the N.B.A.'s Detroit Pistons. "Every square inch of the wall is acoustically paneled. The seats are upholstered.</p>
        <p>"But the acoustics are so good, there's not the booming, echoing sound you get from the sharp edges of the rafters in Boston," Scher said. "And you're talking about the suburban New Jersey fan. Their lives are easier than the fan at the Garden, who zips up his overcoat and holds on to his wallet." A Bit of Success</p>
        <p>It is not impossible to succeed at this arena. The Devils, over the years, have had a better home-to-road point ratio than the Rangers. The Nets traditionally have had more trouble. Larry Brown blamed the place for his departure to Kansas, but the Nets went 30-11 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena under Brown and his successor, Stan Albeck, in 1982-83 and 1983-84.</p>
        <p>At their peak, before Darryl Dawkins wrecked his back by slipping in the bathtub and Micheal Ray Richardson lost another war with cocaine, the Nets beat the Lakers before a sellout crowd on their way to 11 straight victories over all. On that day, Jan. 12, 1983, Taub stood in the Nets' locker room after the game sipping champagne.</p>
        <p>"The Nets have arrived," Taub said.</p>
        <p>The question then, and now, is: Arrived where?</p>
