        <p>Four months after a New York State judge held New York City in contempt for failing to shelter homeless families promptly, dozens of families continue to spend the night in city offices waiting for a room in the city's sprawling shelter system.</p>
        <p>Frustrated by the lack of progress, the judge, Justice Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, last week held the city in contempt again, ordering the city to pay each family $50 for their first overnight stay and $100 for each night thereafter in the offices.</p>

        <p>Four months after a New York State judge held New York City in contempt for failing to shelter homeless families promptly, dozens of families continue to spend the night in city offices waiting for a room in the city's sprawling shelter system.</p>
        <p>Frustrated by the lack of progress, the judge, Justice Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, last week held the city in contempt again, ordering the city to pay each family $50 for their first overnight stay and $100 for each night thereafter in the offices.</p>
        <p>The judge also scheduled hearings to begin April 12 on whether to hold Mayor David N. Dinkins and five high-ranking members of his administration personally in contempt for the same problem.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 20, she had ordered four of the same city officials, not including the Mayor, to spend a night in one of the offices. She wanted them to see what it was like for the families. That ruling is on appeal. Seeking More Time</p>
        <p>The new contempt hearings, seven months before the mayoral election, will undoubtedly be a politically difficult episode for Mr. Dinkins, who campaigned almost four years ago as a defender of homeless children.</p>
        <p>City officials say they are doing everything they can to get the shelter system back in balance and need the judge to give them more time. For example, they said, the city is trying with some success to reduce the number of families going into the system by toughening eligibility, sending some families to live with relatives and helping others avoid eviction.</p>
        <p>The city plans to stop using the offices at night by the end of April and to place families who apply for shelter, after 5 P.M., in shelters or hotels.</p>
        <p>"I think the Mayor can hold his head up high," said Marsha A. Martin, director of the Mayor's office on homelessness. "We're doing everything we can."</p>
        <p>In November, when Justice Freedman made her last contempt ruling, dozens of families were regularly staying overnight in stuffy, cramped offices while they waited for beds in a shelter. In January, the number of families staying overnight rose to as many as 180 each night. The numbers dipped in February, but bounced back up to about 75 a night last week.</p>
        <p>"It's very depressing," Justice Freedman said in an interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Legal Aid Society filed the lawsuit that led to the creation of a legal right to shelter for families 10 years ago tomorrow, on Mar. 31, 1983, yet the homeless crisis rages on and court orders continue to pour forth.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said they have run into unexpected obstacles to unclogging the system like the City Council's efforts to limit a program to house the homeless in privately owned apartments. Mr. Dinkins yesterday rejected a rider that the Council had attached to a budget package. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, predicted that the Council would override the veto on Thursday. 150 People in 2 Rooms</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin said the Council's action, if successful, would make it harder for the city to move families out of the jam-packed shelters.</p>
        <p>The scene in offices, known as "emergency assistance units," is grim. At the emergency assistance unit on the Lower East Side, the fluorescent lights never shut off. As midnight approached one evening earlier this month, about 150 men, women and children were crammed into two smoky rooms. The television blared. Lovers bickered. Children scuffled.</p>
        <p>Parents and children tried with varying degrees of success to sleep under the bright lights on dirty linoleum floors and worn vinyl couches. Some mothers stayed awake and rocked their babies because there were not enough cribs.</p>
        <p>Anna Lou Dehavenon, a medical anthropologist who has studied the families in the units since 1986, said she has found "horrendous conditions" in the last six weeks.</p>
        <p>She interviewed a mother and her 8-year-old daughter, who was taking medication for tuberculosis. They had been in an office for five nights, possibly posing a risk of infection to others in the office, the researcher said. Another time, she interviewed six families. Five of them had a child or infant with a severe case of diarrhea, which is highly communicable in a place where there are not enough places for people to clean themselves and their food, she said.</p>
