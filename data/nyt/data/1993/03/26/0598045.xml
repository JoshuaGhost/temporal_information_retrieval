        <p>A torrent of Kentucky 3-pointers rained on Wake Forest here tonight, washing out the expected showdown between the Wildcats' Jamal Mashburn and the Deacons' Rodney Rogers.</p>
        <p>It was all Mashburn, all classic Rick Pitino basketball, all Kentucky, as the Wildcats destroyed one challenger from the Atlantic Coast Conference, by 103-69, for the chance to sink its paws and its long-range bombing into another, Florida State, in Saturday's Southeast Regional final. The Seminoles fought off stubborn Western Kentucky, 81-78, in overtime, despite missing 20 of 38 free throws.</p>

        <p>A torrent of Kentucky 3-pointers rained on Wake Forest here tonight, washing out the expected showdown between the Wildcats' Jamal Mashburn and the Deacons' Rodney Rogers.</p>
        <p>It was all Mashburn, all classic Rick Pitino basketball, all Kentucky, as the Wildcats destroyed one challenger from the Atlantic Coast Conference, by 103-69, for the chance to sink its paws and its long-range bombing into another, Florida State, in Saturday's Southeast Regional final. The Seminoles fought off stubborn Western Kentucky, 81-78, in overtime, despite missing 20 of 38 free throws.</p>
        <p>From behind the 3-point line, Kentucky did not miss on its first eight attempts tonight. Led by Mashburn, who hit 5 of 5 3-pointers and scored all of his 23 points in the first half, the Wildcats made 12 of 15, or 80 percent, in building a 34-point halftime lead. Travis Ford, who was 4 for 4 on his first-half 3-pointers, led Kentucky with 26 points.</p>
        <p>By the start of the second half, Pitino had mercifully called off his press, though he continued roaming the sideline, stamping his feet and screaming out plays as if his team's survival depended on it. Bombs Away</p>
        <p>The show put on by Mashburn in the first 10 minutes and by the Wildcats in the first half was awesome to behold, demoralizing for Wake Forest to absorb and undoubtedly lucrative for the National Basketball Association-bound Mashburn.</p>
        <p>"I called an early timeout," said Wake Forest Coach Dave Odom, "and I said, 'Hey, they've played perfect basketball, but there's no guarantee they'll continue doing that.' But they did."</p>
        <p>"We were like clay in a potter's hands," Odom added.</p>
        <p>"We defend as well we shoot," said Pitino in giving his own explanation for the blowout.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-7-inch Rogers had commented on Wednesday that he expected the 6-8 Mashburn to roam the perimeter rather than venture inside. Mashburn apparently thought that was a marvelous idea, and Rogers regretted ever opening his mouth.</p>
        <p>Mashburn camped out behind the 3-point line and took advantage of every six inches of extra space that the Deacons' rotating man defense provided to respect his drive. Mashburn hit the first Kentucky 3-pointer, as the Wildcats took a 9-4 lead. Then point guard Travis Ford made it 12-4 with his first 3-pointer, and Kentucky simply blew the Deacons out of the building.</p>
        <p>Another 3-pointer by Dale Brown made it 18-6, causing Rogers and friends to begin panicking, with good reason. Frantically trying to get a basket, Rogers ran over Rodney Dent in the lane, which led to two free throws by Brown for a 20-6 lead. Rogers finally scored, on a 15-foot jumper, but that was soon forgotten in a barrage of Mashburn bombs that settled the showdown issue -- and the outcome of the game -- for good.</p>
        <p>First, he unloaded for 3 from the left wing, to make it 23-6. After Rogers bounced a pass off Ford for a turnover, Mashburn went to the left corner and bombed from there. On the Wildcats' next possession, he dribbled into the lane, drew the double-team and hit Ford on the right wing for another 3.</p>
        <p>After Trelonnie Owens scored for Wake Forest, Mashburn again was given a foot of breathing room by the 6-8 Owens, and that was too much. Another 3 by Mashburn went straight to the bottom of the net. The next time down, Owens finally bodied up, so Mashburn went right around him and to the basket for a layup.</p>
        <p>There were 10 minutes, 23 seconds left in the half; Mashburn had 19 points, including five 3-pointers, and Kentucky led, 34-8. The Deacons stumbled off for a timeout, but they returned in body only. Their spirit sapped, they fell behind, 60-26, by the end of the half, which ended, fittingly, with Ford burying Kentucky's 12th three-pointer of the game. Not only was Rogers outscored, 23-4, but he was also limited to two measly shots.</p>
        <p>In all, Rogers scored only 14 points. "I don't think you can play Rodney Rogers better than we played him tonight," Pitino said. Final Slingshot Hits Rim</p>
        <p>If the Seminoles were watching, they might have decided they did themselves no favor by winning their game against scrappy, but outsized, Western Kentucky, the team that shocked Seton Hall last Saturday in the second round.</p>
        <p>It was difficult to say which of the mighty struggles the Seminoles waged was more difficult, the one against the Hilltoppers or the one against themselves.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until a desperate 3-point attempt by a Western Kentucky freshman named Cypheus Bunton bounced off the rim, went straight up in the air and bounced lazily off the rim again at the end of overtime that State walked off -- wearily, and, some would argue, luckily.</p>
        <p>The region's No. 3-seeded team missed over and over at the free-throw line, shooting only 13 of 29 in the second half. Against a team with no inside game, the Seminoles blew an 11-point lead in the first half, failed on repeated chances to take control of the game, including the last two shots of regulation, and were hanging on at the finish, even though Western Kentucky's two best players -- 5-8 point guard Mark Bell and 6-5 leading scorer Darnell Mee -- had fouled out.</p>
        <p>Down, 80-78, with 21.1 seconds left in overtime, Hilltoppers Coach Ralph Willard called timeout and tried to set up a 3-point shot for Darrin Horn, going for the victory. But Horn couldn't get open and a freshman guard who had replaced Bell, Michael Fraliex, threw the ball out of bounds making an entry pass to the low post.</p>
        <p>Freshman Derrick Carroll's free throw made it 81-78 for the Seminoles, before Bunton's final shot missed falling through, twice, at the buzzer. A Crucial Call</p>
        <p>The fifth foul on Bell, the Hilltoppers' key player, might have decided the game. It came with the Seminoles leading, 78-76, in overtime, but with Bell driving to the basket after intercepting a pass by Florida State's Charlie Ward. Ward retreated to defend against the Western Kentucky break, and when Bell dished off to Darius Hall for a layup, the two point guards collided. Bell, who scored 15 points, was called for charging went out with 53.9 seconds left.</p>
        <p>"It could've been a block or a charge," said Bell in describing the kind of play that almost every close college game seems to come down to.</p>
        <p>Mee led Western Kentucky, the champion of the Sun Belt Conference, with 21 points before fouling out with 1:01 left in regulation. Doug Edwards led Florida State with 19 points, Bob Sura added 17 and Rodney Dobard had 16 points and 13 rebounds.</p>
