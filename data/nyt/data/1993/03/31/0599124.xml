        <p>Another couple who forged what must be considered a highly successful professional partnership -- Dr. WILLIAM H. MASTERS and VIRGINIA E. JOHNSON -- have ended their marriage but will continue to work together.</p>
        <p>The pioneer researchers in the physiology of sex were granted a divorce earlier this month by Associate Judge Joseph A. Goeke 3d of the Circuit Court of St. Louis County in Clayton, Mo.</p>
        <p>Neither has publicly discussed the end of their 22-year marriage, but WILLIAM R. YOUNG, director of the Masters and Johnson Institute in St. Louis, was more than willing to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>"If you're going to get divorced, this is the way to do it: without rancor, bitterness, hatred or public displays of foolishness," he said. "They have been in each other's pockets for 34 years, professionally and personally, so there will always be fond admiration and respect."</p>
        <p>So what did the happy un-couple do when they got their divorce decree?</p>
        <p>"They signed them and then went out to dinner," Mr. Young said.</p>
