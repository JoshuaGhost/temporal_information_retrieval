        <p>FOR the Seattle Opera's new production of Debussy's "Pelleas et Melisande," which opened on March 13 and closes tonight, the forest is envisioned as shimmering, transparent emerald-green columns, the garden as a single 20-foot-high, 50-foot-long amber and yellow flower made of plastic. The sets were designed by Dale Chihuly, the Seattle glass artist.</p>
        <p>"I began to envision immense glass forms on a black glass stage," Mr. Chihuly said. Metal frames were clad in transparent plastic, and the plastic was painted to resemble glass that was opalescent or transparent, ruby red or amber. The chandelier, above, resembles an "organic radish," the artist said.</p>

        <p>Speight Jenkins, general director of the Seattle Opera, had invited the artist to design the sets in 1991. "I instantly said yes," Mr. Chihuly said. He wanted to work on a grand scale, and found the lure of working with theatrical lighting irresistible.  CURRENTS</p>
