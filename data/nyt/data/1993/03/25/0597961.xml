        <p>Alden S. McWilliams, a cartoonist and co-creator of the first black lead character in an American comic strip, died last Friday at a hospital in Stamford, Conn. He was 77 and a resident of Darien, Conn., and Eastham, Mass.</p>
        <p>The cause was respiratory failure, his family said.</p>
        <p>For 55 years, he drew and wrote for syndicated strips and comic books. Noted for his realistic style, he won the Cartoonist Society's 1978 award as the Best Story Cartoonist.</p>
        <p>In 1968 he and the writer John Saunders introduced Danny Raven as the black co-star of "Dateline: Danger," a strip about two reporters. Eventually other regular black roles began appearing on the previously segregated comic page, where they had been relegated to bit parts and stereotypes like cannibals.</p>
        <p>The idea for a black-and-white pair originated with Mr. McWilliams's work on the "I Spy" comic book, based on the television serial's interracial cast of Bill Cosby and Robert Culp.</p>
        <p>The comic books he worked on were Military Comics, Crack Comics, Airboy, Star Trek, The Wild West, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and He-Man. Among the syndicated strips, he was the co-producer of "Twin Earths" and also drew "Davy Jones," "Rip Kirby," "Curly Kayoe," "On Stage" and "Dan Flagg."</p>
        <p>He served in the Army in World War II.</p>
        <p>Surviving are his wife of 46 years, the former Ruth Jensen; two sons, Chris J., of Westford, Mass., and A. Richard, of Millbrook, N.Y.; a sister, Faith Dargay of Riverside, Conn., and four grandchildren.</p>
