        <p>Two of Wall Street's most successful bond traders, John W. Meriwether and Eric R. Rosenfeld, are exploring getting back into the business, possibly by starting a money management firm.</p>
        <p>Formerly the vice chairman of Salomon Brothers, Mr. Meriwether was in charge of all bond trading at the firm until he resigned in 1991 after it became involved in a Treasury auction scandal. After Mr. Meriwether's resignation, Mr. Rosenfeld, one of Mr. Meriwether's deputies, was named to oversee the firm's bond trading desks. But he resigned in January to pursue other interests. Lure of Independence</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Meriwether said he and Mr. Rosenfeld were exploring possible avenues for working together, but declined to be more specific. Bloomberg Business News reported yesterday that Mr. Rosenfeld had told friends that he was trying to raise money for a new company that would manage money. Mr. Rosenfeld did not return calls seeking comment last night.</p>

        <p>Two of Wall Street's most successful bond traders, John W. Meriwether and Eric R. Rosenfeld, are exploring getting back into the business, possibly by starting a money management firm.</p>
        <p>Formerly the vice chairman of Salomon Brothers, Mr. Meriwether was in charge of all bond trading at the firm until he resigned in 1991 after it became involved in a Treasury auction scandal. After Mr. Meriwether's resignation, Mr. Rosenfeld, one of Mr. Meriwether's deputies, was named to oversee the firm's bond trading desks. But he resigned in January to pursue other interests. Lure of Independence</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Meriwether said he and Mr. Rosenfeld were exploring possible avenues for working together, but declined to be more specific. Bloomberg Business News reported yesterday that Mr. Rosenfeld had told friends that he was trying to raise money for a new company that would manage money. Mr. Rosenfeld did not return calls seeking comment last night.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Meriwether and Mr. Rosenfeld would be attractive hires for any number of banks or brokerage firms, the independence of setting up their own firm may be attractive, people on Wall Street said. In today's market, it would not be difficult to gather investments from wealthy families and other aggressive investors.</p>
        <p>"There is a lot of noninstitutional money that is looking for people who have good reputations and are swingers," said Greg Kipness, a former quantitative trader with Morgan Stanley &amp; Company who now runs the Zenith Group, a trading firm.</p>
        <p>Some more conservative investors, like pension funds, may also want to invest in a firm that uses quantitative strategies, traders said. Advanced Mathematics</p>
        <p>Mr. Meriwether pioneered the use of advanced mathematics to exploit technical discrepancies in the bond market. He hired a small group of academics, including Mr. Rosenfeld, a former Harvard professor.</p>
        <p>Unlike hectic traders who buy and sell every day, Mr. Meriwether's group would put billions of dollars into trades not meant to pay of for as long as two years. In 1990, the group was reported to have made a profit of $400 million, of which $60 million was divided among the dozen traders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meriwether was fined $50,000 by the Securities and Exchange Commission and suspended from the securities business for three months for failing to supervise Paul Mozer, the head of Salomon's government bond desk, who submitted false bids in a Treasury bond auction.</p>
