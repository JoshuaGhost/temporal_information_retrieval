        <p>"I was surprised, but I hope that other women will try out now," said Davis, who beat out two finalists in auditions at Candlestick Park.</p>
        <p>She was the only woman among the nine competitors called back for the second round of auditions. Almost 500 people showed up earlier this month to try out for the job. Eight were women.</p>
        <p>Davis, who said she was in her early 40's, has a theater and voice background that goes back nearly 25 years. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASEBALL</p>
