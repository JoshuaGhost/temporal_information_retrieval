        <p>It was, as they say, deja vu all over again. Ten days ago in a Regional Swiss Teams in Smithtown, L.I., John Rengstorff of Manhattan picked up a hand with 7-6-0-0 distribution, which a player can expect once in almost 20,000 deals. He bid and made five hearts, with 14 high-card points in the partnership hands, but was not pleased with the result: His teammates had doubled the same contract, and it had made an overtrick.</p>
        <p>One week later, playing against the same opponent in the Grand National Swiss Team in Manhattan, he picked up the South hand shown in the diagram and blinked. He considered slam possibilities when his partner doubled the opening one-diamond bid, but contented himself with a cue-bid followed by a bid of four hearts.</p>

        <p>It was, as they say, deja vu all over again. Ten days ago in a Regional Swiss Teams in Smithtown, L.I., John Rengstorff of Manhattan picked up a hand with 7-6-0-0 distribution, which a player can expect once in almost 20,000 deals. He bid and made five hearts, with 14 high-card points in the partnership hands, but was not pleased with the result: His teammates had doubled the same contract, and it had made an overtrick.</p>
        <p>One week later, playing against the same opponent in the Grand National Swiss Team in Manhattan, he picked up the South hand shown in the diagram and blinked. He considered slam possibilities when his partner doubled the opening one-diamond bid, but contented himself with a cue-bid followed by a bid of four hearts.</p>
        <p>This hardly did justice to his distribution, but his partner continued, visualizing a slam opposite any long, strong heart suit. This put South in a theoretical quandary: The books suggest responses to Blackwood when holding two aces and a void, or one ace and a void, but they do not consider the possibility of two voids. South made a practical bid of six hearts, which was the truth although not the whole truth: Most experts use this jump response to show one ace plus a void in a higher-ranking suit. Notice that the seven-card club suit was undisclosed.</p>
        <p>West led the club king and continued with the ace to force dummy to ruff. South ruffed with dummy's jack, ruffed a diamond and led the heart ten. When the queen appeared he claimed the slam, with far more winners than he needed.</p>
        <p>In such circumstances it is sensible for West to lead the club ace rather than the king, leaving the declarer to guess who has the king. Continuing with a low card when a dummy has a singleton can be effective, and would have given South great problems on this deal.</p>
        <p>In the replay South was content to play four hearts, and the gain of 11 imps helped Rengstorff's team finish second in the event and advance to the knockout stage of the competition. His results with 7-6 distribution are clearly improving. Will he have another such hand in his next Swiss Teams? The odds are only about 350 to one against.</p>
