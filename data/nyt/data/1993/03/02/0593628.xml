        <p>One mark of a great player is his ability to surmount calamity, a trait impressively shown by Anatoly Karpov in the 55th running of the Hoogoven International Tournament in Wijk-aan-Zee, the Netherlands. The event, which finished on Jan. 31, combined a series of knockout matches with a Swiss-system tournament for those who were knocked out. In one of the worst blunders of his career, Karpov lost a piece on the 12th move against the American grandmaster Larry Christiansen. The former world champion from Russia resigned at once. Yet he leveled the score in their second encounter and disposed of Christiansen in the rapid-play tiebreak games that followed.</p>
        <p>He then went on to defeat the English grandmaster John Nunn in the next round, and, in the semifinal round, Valery Salov, a former Russian grandmaster now living in Spain.</p>

        <p>One mark of a great player is his ability to surmount calamity, a trait impressively shown by Anatoly Karpov in the 55th running of the Hoogoven International Tournament in Wijk-aan-Zee, the Netherlands. The event, which finished on Jan. 31, combined a series of knockout matches with a Swiss-system tournament for those who were knocked out. In one of the worst blunders of his career, Karpov lost a piece on the 12th move against the American grandmaster Larry Christiansen. The former world champion from Russia resigned at once. Yet he leveled the score in their second encounter and disposed of Christiansen in the rapid-play tiebreak games that followed.</p>
        <p>He then went on to defeat the English grandmaster John Nunn in the next round, and, in the semifinal round, Valery Salov, a former Russian grandmaster now living in Spain.</p>
        <p>Karpov consummated his recovery by defeating the Spanish grandmaster Miguel Illescas Cordoba 2 1/2-1 1/2 in a four-game final match that gave him first place. Quiet positional play and relentless endgame technique were responsible for Karpov's victory in Game 2 of this series with Illescas Cordoba. The other games were drawn.</p>
        <p>A Slav Defense becomes a Semi-Slav when Black plays 4 . . . e6 rather than 4 . . . dc; 4 . . . Bf5?! 5 cd Nd5 (5. . . cd 6 Qb3 is strong for White) 6 e3 e6 7 Bc4 Nd7 8 0-0 Be7 9 Qe2 would be superior for White. After 5 e3 Nbd7, the chief Semi-Slav plan is to answer 6 Bd3 by 6 . . . dc 7 Bc4 b5 8 Bd3 and then either 8 . . . a6 or 8 . . . Bb7 to prepare an early counterattack with . . . c5.</p>
        <p>The object of 6 Qc2 is to discourage 6 . . . dc because White would be a tempo ahead after 7 Bc4. After 6 . . . Bd6, the currently popular pawn sacrifice with 7 g4!? had no lure for Karpov, who does not like the unclear when a solid, conservative move like 7 Be2 is available.</p>
        <p>Gary Kasparov's method of opening the position, 8 . . . e5 9 cd cd 10 de Ne5 11 Rd1 Nf3 12 Bf3 Qc7, is not refuted, yet Illescas Cordoba lost with it against Vladimir Akopian in Chalcidice, Greece, last year and evidently does not trust it.</p>
        <p>Karpov acquired the bishop-pair with 15 Nf5 Bf5 16 Qf5 and Illescas Cordoba neutralized the white center with 16 . . . ed 17 ed c5, relying on the point that 18 d5? Qe5! forces 19 Qe5 Be5, winning a piece for Black. But after 18 Be3 cd 19 Bd4 Be5 20 Be5 Qe5 21 Qe5 Re5 22 Rab1 Rb8 23 Bf3, Black's b7 pawn became vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Illescas Cordoba should have played 23 . . . b6, but after 24 Nd5 Nd5 (24 . . . N8d7? 25 Nb4!) 25 cd Nd7 26 d6, White's passed d6 pawn is dangerous. His alternative, 23 . . . Rc5? 24 Bb7, may have been based on a failure to foresee that 24 . . . Rc4 would have been ruined by 25 Ba6 Rb1 26 Bc4! with an easily winning endgame for White.</p>
        <p>On 25 Nd5, Illescas Cordoba could not capture a pawn with 25 . . . Rc4 because 26 Ba6 Rb1 27 Rb1 Ra4 28 Rb8 Kh7 29 Bd3 Ne4 30 f3 wins the pinned knight.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Karpov could have won more easily with 35 Ba4 because 35 . . . Nc4 36 Nc4 Rc4 37 Bb3 Rc7 38 Rg6 puts Black two pawns down. On the other hand, his 35 Nd5 let Illescas Cordoba put up a good fight with the exchange sacrifice 35 . . . Rc6 36 Ne7 Kg7 37 Nc6 Nc4. After 38 Ra7 Na3, Karpov dared not venture into 39 Ne5 Kf6 40 Nf7? because 40 . . . Nab5 41 Rb7 a3 42 Nd8 a2 43 Rb6 Kf5 44 Ra6 Nd4 denies White a defense to 45 . . . Nc2 and 46 a1/Q.</p>
        <p>Karpov could not force a winning exchange of knights with 46 Nf3 Nc4 47 Ne5 Ne3 48 Kf3 Nc2. Yet he soon found a nice way to win with 52 g4! hg 53 Kg4! Kg7 54 f5!, his point being that by opening a front on the far king's wing, the black knights were unable to offer opposition.</p>
        <p>After 61 Ne5, Illescas Cordoba gave up in view of 61 . . . a3 62 Rg7 Kf8 63 Ng6 Ke8 64 f7. SLAV DEFENSE</p>
