        <p>The Bombay police said tonight that a reputed drug trafficker in the city who has fled to Dubai was responsible for the wave of bombings last Friday that killed 232 people, wounded more than 1,400 and severely damaged major buildings.</p>
        <p>The police commissioner, Amarjit Singh Samra, made the announcement at a news conference at which he said that two men were arrested today and that they had confessed that the crime figure had paid them about $160 to plant some of the bombs.</p>
        <p>For a week India has been gripped by uncertainty over whether the country faced foreign-inspired terrorism to destabilize the country; members of the governing Congress Party and the opposition Hindu party have publicly accused Pakistan of organizing the bombings, assertions that have aggravated India's already tense relations with its neighbor.</p>
        <p>The Bombay police have said a plastic explosive, Semtex, was used in the bombings, a finding that some politicians saw as proof that their neighbor was involved, but a Western diplomat in New Delhi said today that even that was no longer certain.</p>
        <p>The announcement today, if it is borne out, appears to undermine suspicions about Pakistan, and an explosion in Calcutta four days after the blasts in Bombay is now thought to be unrelated.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Samra said the police had "clinching evidence" that implicated Ibrahim Abdul Razaq Memon, a Bombay crime figure known as Tiger, as well as his family. The commissioner said the two men arrested today said Mr. Memon had hired them to spread chaos in the city.</p>
        <p>"They really didn't seem to understand what they were doing," Mr. Samra said. "The were given some 5,000 rupees for the job. Later, when they saw it happen, I think they themselves were scared."</p>
        <p>Mr. Samra said the Memon family intended to incite chaos because they believed it would help their drug-smuggling operations.</p>
        <p>One of men arrested today, the commissioner said, confessed to driving a jeep filled with explosives into a central Bombay market area while the other man parked a motor-scooter packed with explosives in the city's jewelry and bullion market. The second bomb was discovered before it went off. Refuge in Emirate</p>
        <p>Mr. Samra did not identify either of the men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Samra had said earlier that the police had learned that Mr. Memon and his family had flown to Dubai last week. Dubai has become a haven for organized-crime figures from India because the emirate has no extradition treaty with India.</p>
        <p>Whether Dubai was considering India's request to turn over the Memon family is not clear.</p>
        <p>Organized crime, particularly drug smuggling, has been on the rise in Bombay, Western diplomats and the police say, but the police do not seem to have not been particularly effective in striking at crime families. Indeed, several journalists in Bombay said they could not think of a single major arrest in recent years.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the bombings, there was considerable fear in Bombay that the blasts would set off new violence between Hindus and Muslims. There was speculation that the explosions had been caused by Muslims retaliating for the organized campaign of violence against them in January.</p>
        <p>But although the Memons are Muslim, Mr. Samra said their religion was not a factor in the case. "They are criminals," he said. "Their religion does not matter." Warning From the U.S.</p>
        <p>Two days ago the State Department warned Americans not to travel to New Delhi because a terrorist attack might occur, and all travel by Embassy employees has been suspended. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering, who was to leave for his new assignment as Ambassador to Moscow, has delayed his departure because of the security threat.</p>
