        <p>Japan and Mexico, two of the world's most economically dynamic countries and each long dominated by a single party, last week suffered embarrassments born of the riches that make their political systems work for the well-connected.</p>
        <p>In Japan, Shin Kanemaru, until recently the kingmaker of the ruling Liberal Democrats, suffered disgrace on top of tax evasion charges when the authorities went through his home and offices and found hundreds of pounds of gold bars and $50 million in cash and securities. The stash is widely assumed to have been ill-gotten, and meant as grease for Mr. Kanemaru to apply to the wheels of Japanese politics. Even jaded Japanese were amazed at just how much political lubrication is evidently required nowadays.</p>

        <p>Japan and Mexico, two of the world's most economically dynamic countries and each long dominated by a single party, last week suffered embarrassments born of the riches that make their political systems work for the well-connected.</p>
        <p>In Japan, Shin Kanemaru, until recently the kingmaker of the ruling Liberal Democrats, suffered disgrace on top of tax evasion charges when the authorities went through his home and offices and found hundreds of pounds of gold bars and $50 million in cash and securities. The stash is widely assumed to have been ill-gotten, and meant as grease for Mr. Kanemaru to apply to the wheels of Japanese politics. Even jaded Japanese were amazed at just how much political lubrication is evidently required nowadays.</p>
        <p>In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari tried to quell a furor created by reports that he had asked nearly 30 executives to contribute $25 million each to the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party. This after Mr. Salinas had promised repeatedly to make political competition in Mexico more fair.</p>
        <p>The developments stirred new calls for reform in both countries, which are trying to enhance their international profiles.</p>
        <p>Dogged by scandal at home, Japan's politicians are hard-pressed to exert leadership abroad commensurate with its economic clout. And Mexico is having a hard time convincing skeptics that it is democratically progressive enough to be intertwined with the United States and Canada in the still-unratified North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
        <p>It's all enough to set tongues clucking in Washington among elected officials dependent on year-round fund-raising and political action committees.</p>
