        <p>THE NAMES OF THE MOUNTAINS</p>
        <p>By Reeve Lindbergh. 237 pp. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. $19.</p>
        <p>THE story of Charles A. Lindbergh's historic trans-Atlantic flight of 1927 retains its capacity to thrill and inspire. Joyce Milton's "Loss of Eden: A Biography of Charles and Anne Morrow Lindbergh," the first new account in many years, reminds us why even more audacious feats of aviation and space exploration -- hurtling men and machinery to the moon and beyond -- have never surpassed its impact. Lindbergh flew solo. His achievement was something more than a technological, material accomplishment; it was a triumph of the individual human spirit.</p>
        <p>The great New York-Paris air race had already claimed six lives when the lanky and boyishly handsome young American entered the contest, his flying experience amounting to a few years in the Midwest as an itinerant barnstormer and airmail pilot. Yet he cajoled businessmen in St. Louis into financing his venture and then persuaded a near-bankrupt company in California to build a plane, an amalgam of two existing models, with wingspan, fuselage and other details crafted to his personal specifications. After just a few test runs, he flew it from San Diego to Long Island, with a rest-and-refueling stop in St. Louis, in 21 hours 45 minutes elapsed flying time, a record, using a couple of Rand McNally maps as guides.</p>
        <p>Indeed, an improbable improvisation -- some might say recklessness -- prevailed in many aspects of the endeavor. Fearful of being crushed between engine and gas tank in the event of a crash, Lindbergh situated his cockpit low and to the rear of his small aircraft. He flew with no forward visibility -- no loss, as he joked, since he did not expect to run into much traffic. Conventional emergency provisions were jettisoned in favor of carrying the weight of a maximum fuel load. He lifted off the muddy runway of Roosevelt Field on Long Island with only a few sandwiches, canned rations, fresh water and a small inflatable life raft in case of a forced landing at sea.</p>
        <p>YET, 33 1/2 hours later, almost precisely on course and several hours ahead of schedule, Lindbergh set down at Le Bourget airfield outside Paris. And the rest, of course, is history. Hysterical press attention made him the darling of two continents and a virtual captive of his own celebrity. Soon married to the young Anne Morrow, he was haunted by frenzied fans everywhere he went until finally finding refuge for his young family in a remote spot in rural New Jersey. There, in 1932, his first child, Charles Jr., 20 months old, was kidnapped and murdered, the notorious crime quickly overshadowing the father's celestial triumph.</p>
        <p>In the years following, Lindbergh rarely found the will to work tenaciously through professional or personal challenges. Though he consulted on many of the major developments in commercial and military aviation, his career drifted and his politics careered out of control. While living in exile in Europe he developed an infatuation with German military prowess that blinded him to Hitler's darker aspects.</p>
        <p>Returning to the United States as the German armies began their sweep across Eastern Europe, he broke a longstanding public silence to air his opposition to American intervention. He made a national radio address tinged with racialist views about the superiority of white Western civilizations. Sounding like a Nazi, even as he disclaimed the label, he opposed America's entry into World War II and drew specific charges of anti-Semitism by claiming that a Jewish lobby was in part responsible for the war fervor in the Roosevelt Administration.</p>
        <p>Ms. Milton, the author of "The Yellow Kids: Foreign Correspondents in the Heyday of Yellow Journalism," points out that the isolationist America First movement enjoyed widespread support among some intelligent, respectable citizens, but few used their stature, as Lindbergh did, to inveigh against American involvement right up to Pearl Harbor. Understandably, he never overcame this shabby episode, though he did manage to rescue some of his youthful glory with the publication in 1954 of his account of the historic flight, "The Spirit of St. Louis," which won the Pulitzer Prize. That book combines a spellbinding narrative of the flight with autobiographical ruminations and philosophical reflections that leave no doubt of his intelligence, will and courage. But if his book successfully exposed the character traits that had made him a hero at the age of 25, it suggested, perhaps less consciously, why he was driven to fly in the first place. He wrote tellingly of his passion for the air: "I live only in the moment in this strange unmortal space, crowded with beauty, pierced with danger."</p>
        <p>Charles Lindbergh spent the years before his death in 1974 as an amateur anthropologist and conservationist and a "romantic reactionary" (in Joyce Milton's term), traveling the world in search of a personal refuge from what he saw as the mindless materialism of modern culture. Friends and family have long justified his political lapses by explaining the disillusionment with the democratic excesses of free speech and press that followed meteoric fame and the death of his son. Ms. Milton searches for other clues.</p>
        <p>She finds some answers in the particulars of the childhood Lindbergh apparently never fully confronted. His charismatic father, Charles A. Lindbergh, was a lawyer in the small farming community of Little Falls, Minn. His mother, Evangeline Land, had been a young and high-spirited high school science teacher from Detroit. The marriage foundered when their son, Charles, was just 5, and she insisted on living apart.</p>
        <p>THE FATHER, by then elected to Congress as a Progressive Republican, found solace in long hours of work. The mother, depressed, lonely and erratic, became overly invested in her son, and they shuttled back and forth between Washington, Little Falls and Detroit, as he attended at least 11 different schools and formed few, if any, real friendships. Evangeline found them an apartment in Madison in 1920 when Charles enrolled at the University of Wisconsin. He quickly dropped out to take up flying, then considered more escapism than career. His mother couldn't follow him into the sky.</p>
        <p>Some outgrow youthful complications in defining the boundaries of self; as Ms. Milton tells it, Lindbergh did not. (He was arrested in his capacity for personal growth, perhaps, by the frenzied celebrity that gave him an inescapable public identity.) She is best at describing the haven Lindbergh tried to create for himself in the one enduring relationship of his life, his marriage to Anne Morrow, the gifted, if ethereal, middle daughter of Dwight Morrow, a Wall Street investor and Republican Party stalwart, who took charge of the impressionable and by then fatherless young hero. Anne's girlhood cocoon of wealth and privilege had in reality been compromised by her father's alcoholism. But Anne, like her husband, chose to ignore life's more stressful dimensions rather than confront them openly.</p>
        <p>The Lindberghs' romantic early companionship in the air, charting flight routes to faraway places, entranced a worshipful public. And later Anne became a critically acclaimed and commercially successful writer in her own right. She drew on their shared adventures and common spiritual quests in the memoirs, diaries and letters she published, even as she repeatedly decried the public's invasion of her family's privacy.</p>
        <p>Joyce Milton does not write with the Lindberghs' own flair for storytelling. Still she offers a compelling tale, woven of research in available archives. Perhaps in response to the recent revival of popular interest in the kidnapping, she spends a disproportionate amount of time on what is often called the crime of the century, concluding that Bruno Richard Hauptmann, the man convicted and electrocuted in 1936, was in fact the culprit, but probably acted in complicity with a servant inside the extended Morrow-Lindbergh household.</p>
        <p>Having chosen A. Scott Berg as her authorized biographer, Anne Lindbergh did not allow Ms. Milton access to her husband's personal papers at Yale or permission to quote from other correspondence. A promised interview never materialized after Mrs. Lindbergh, who is now 86, became ill and disoriented. The two daughters who did agree to talk do so without attribution. This is a pity, because Ms. Milton seems sympathetically inclined, perhaps even more so than Reeve Lindbergh, the couple's youngest child, a writer best known for her children's books.</p>
        <p>"The Names of the Mountains" is a thinly veiled autobiographical account by Ms. Lindbergh of her siblings' adult lives and of her mother's later years. In the novel, Cal Linley has died and his widow, Alicia, is losing her memory. Their surviving children, scattered in distant places, come together by chance, and the reunion occasions a candid accounting of the past. The story resonates with the experience all children face in coming to terms with the mortality of their parents, but because the Lindbergh experience is unique it is difficult to extract universal themes.</p>
        <p>"The Names of the Mountains" takes its title from the author's ambivalent feelings about her strong-willed parents. She is grateful for the forceful direction they gave her ("Our parents could name the mountains around us, and the stars over our heads"), as both pioneering aviators and good parents ought to do. But she recognizes something fundamentally dishonest about the certitude they claimed on so many subjects, certitude that often masked a deep and unexamined confusion. So too she seems to understand that the isolated and largely self-absorbed life her parents led was not due only, as they claimed, to their youthful fame and its unhappy consequences. It also allowed them never to account for themselves to anyone except each other.</p>
        <p>REEVE LINDBERGH writes with deep and abiding affection for her parents and their rare capacity to "drink in the solitude like water and breathe it out like air." Like them, Cressy, the narrator, finds herself happiest when lost in books or in nature. She has chosen a rural, contemplative life, modeled after her sheltered and in some ways enviable childhood as the youngest child.</p>
        <p>But Cressy doesn't trust her parents' apparent serenity and hasn't been able to replicate it. Like most of her siblings, she has been divorced and is still struggling to come to terms with herself and a second relationship. This prompts her to recall her father elsewhere as a compulsive talker -- an "obnoxious, overbearing, inescapable presence" -- who never tired of exasperating his wife and children. She remembers her mother, by contrast, as often silent and distracted, always protectively buried in her own thoughts, refusing to talk back.</p>
        <p>In her own published diaries, however, Anne Morrow Lindbergh allowed herself the last word. "A husband, a good marriage, is earth," she wrote in 1944. "Charles is earth to me, the whole world, life." It's a curious image for the marriage of two people who found their greatest contentment and glory in the skies. That much the daughter may understand better than the biographer.</p>
