        <p>GOING BACK TO A place is easy; going back in time is not, especially when the absence had been too long, in my case, some 30 years.</p>
        <p>I had visited the Langstrath Valley, an offshoot of Borrowdale in the Lake District of England, as a teen-ager. There I had learned the rough-edged art of clambering over mountains in smooth-soled boots -- pitting a young man's arrogance against the fissured rock faces -- and then spending the night in a billowy bell tent.

        <p>GOING BACK TO A place is easy; going back in time is not, especially when the absence had been too long, in my case, some 30 years.</p>
        <p>I had visited the Langstrath Valley, an offshoot of Borrowdale in the Lake District of England, as a teen-ager. There I had learned the rough-edged art of clambering over mountains in smooth-soled boots -- pitting a young man's arrogance against the fissured rock faces -- and then spending the night in a billowy bell tent. Returning recently, middle-aged, I was prepared for the worst: the region's pristine beauty would be gone, the streams polluted, the mountains,</p>
        <p>my</p>
        <p>mountains, signposted in neon.</p>
        <p>So the surprise was all the more delicious as we drove into the valley -- my daughter the same age as I had been when I first visited -- and found that, while I had certainly changed, this beloved place had not.</p>
        <p>Yes, the mountains seemed a little less imposing to an older, blearier eye: the Lake District has never been the Himalayas. But they rose grandly in swirls of mist and sunlight and rainbows almost exactly as I had recalled them, the familiar valley leading away from the smooth greensward and enduring slate-roofed farmhouses of its floor to the distant points of England's highest peak, Scafell Pike.</p>
        <p>And, just where the twisty tarred lane gave way to a walker's track, we found the Langstrath Hotel, a small, warm hostelry that the tyro mountaineer had dismissed as suited only to the aged and the effete.</p>
        <p>Not so this time.</p>
        <p>We dined on trout, played Trivial Pursuit by the fireplace in the cozy sitting room, took leisurely strolls by the clear streams of the valley, leaving the peaks to the more adventurous. My youthful battles long past, the place was offering a gentle welcome back -- and embracing a new generation too.</p>
