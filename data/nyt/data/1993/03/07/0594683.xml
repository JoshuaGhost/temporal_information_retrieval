        <p>When are we going to elect a Suffolk County Supervisor who really understands the connection between sound economic development on Long Island and the safety of our ground water? Robert J. Gaffney is supporting efforts by certain shortsighted business groups to gut Article 7 of our County Health Code, praised nationally as a model safeguard for areas that depend solely on underground aquifers for their drinking water.</p>
        <p>He wants to take away the only legal protection we have left to keep industry from warehousing dangerously large amounts of toxic chemicals on top of Suffolk's Special Ground Water Protection Areas. This includes (coincidentally?) the one in Melville, where Parr Development would like to build a facility for the Olympus Corporation, which would be permitted to store photographic chemicals at its site.</p>

        <p>When are we going to elect a Suffolk County Supervisor who really understands the connection between sound economic development on Long Island and the safety of our ground water? Robert J. Gaffney is supporting efforts by certain shortsighted business groups to gut Article 7 of our County Health Code, praised nationally as a model safeguard for areas that depend solely on underground aquifers for their drinking water.</p>
        <p>He wants to take away the only legal protection we have left to keep industry from warehousing dangerously large amounts of toxic chemicals on top of Suffolk's Special Ground Water Protection Areas. This includes (coincidentally?) the one in Melville, where Parr Development would like to build a facility for the Olympus Corporation, which would be permitted to store photographic chemicals at its site.</p>
        <p>Does Mr. Gaffney still not understand that Long Island's drinking water lies under our feet? We don't have it piped in from some upstate reservoir like New York City does. It is sheer insanity to increase the risk of industry's spilling poisonous substances into our deep ground-water recharge areas.</p>
        <p>Now we must count on Suffolk Health Commissioner Mary Hibbard to block Mr. Gaffney and his tunnel vision, jobs-at-any-cost supporters from weakening Article 7. We need a County Executive who really understands what we must have for sustainable growth, and completely assured safe water is basic to this. Who will pay the millions of dollars to clean up accidental spills into our aquifer? Our aquifer experts don't even know if it's possible to do it for any amount of money -- like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube!</p>
        <p>At this moment there are 92 federally designated toxic-waste sites here in Suffolk County alone, waiting (seemingly forever) to be cleaned up. Hundreds of others of less severity dot the maps in our county health department. It is doubtful if more such evidence will persuade many Long Island industries to stop their penny-wise-and-pound-foolish development approach to business. Weakening Article 7 regulations will only make an already dangerous situation even worse. LOIS BLUSH  Dix Hills</p>
