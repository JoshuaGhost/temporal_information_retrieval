        <p>GIVE 37 industrial design students wood veneer that looks like bird's-eye maple, oak or walnut, and let them cut, boil and steam it. The result? "Explorations in Veneer: Ideas Toward Objects," an exhibition of 17 designs by students at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. The show runs through March 13 at Gallery 91 in SoHo.</p>
        <p>J. Maruszewski won first prize for scoring a single sheet of veneer and folding it into two translucent lamps that can be squashed flat, or stretched out.</p>

        <p>GIVE 37 industrial design students wood veneer that looks like bird's-eye maple, oak or walnut, and let them cut, boil and steam it. The result? "Explorations in Veneer: Ideas Toward Objects," an exhibition of 17 designs by students at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. The show runs through March 13 at Gallery 91 in SoHo.</p>
        <p>J. Maruszewski won first prize for scoring a single sheet of veneer and folding it into two translucent lamps that can be squashed flat, or stretched out.</p>
        <p>Curt Meissner won second prize for a screen made from a single panel of veneer. Li-Ling Huang won third place for a conceptual project; she projected slides of different veneer onto tree branches so they would change from oak to walnut to bird's-eye.</p>
        <p>Jorge Paricio made a pair of scissors (above) with butternut veneer twisted around a plastic tube.</p>
        <p>The veneer, in 36 different patterns, was donated by Brookside Veneer, a Metuchen, N.J. distributor. The gallery is at 91 Grand Street (at Greene Street). Information: (212) 966-3722.</p>
