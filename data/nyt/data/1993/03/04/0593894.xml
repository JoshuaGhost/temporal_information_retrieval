        <p>The dancers looked beautifully trained and scrupulously rehearsed when the Bavarian National Ballet of the Munich State Opera offered "Don Quixote" on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater.

        <p>The dancers looked beautifully trained and scrupulously rehearsed when the Bavarian National Ballet of the Munich State Opera offered "Don Quixote" on Tuesday night at the New York State Theater. Konstanze Vernon, the troupe's director, certainly knows how to develop a harmonious ensemble.</p>
        <p>Allegro steps were clear as well as fast. Poses were firmly held without any wobbles. Christina McDermott and Oliver Matz, who were cast in the leading roles of Kitri and Basilio, bounded effortlessly throughout the two-act production. Their pas de deux in the final scene was especially notable for Mr. Matz's spectacular leaps and Miss McDermott's series of sharp whipping turns.</p>
        <p>All the dancers were a joy to behold. But the production was not. Although "Don Quixote" is a frothy, amiably feather-brained ballet, it is not easy to stage in a convincing fashion. For one thing, despite its title, Don Quixote is only a minor character and most of the dramatic action is devoted to the romantic problems of Kitri and Basilio. With its lilting score by Ludwig Minkus, "Don Quixote" resembles a danced operetta. Marius Petipa choreographed its premiere in Moscow in 1869, and ever since then other choreographers have been tinkering with it.</p>
        <p>The Munich production, which dates from 1991, is by Ray Barra, a San Francisco-born dancer, choreographer and ballet master who has worked with many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Stuttgart Ballet. What makes his version peculiar is the way it completely changes in tone after its prologue.</p>
        <p>With Peter Jolesch as a feverish, wild-eyed Don Quixote battling invisible demons and gesturing adoringly toward Elena Pankova, who played Dulcinea, his vision of ideal love, this prologue was far more intense than its equivalent in many other conceptions of the scene. But what followed was virtually a suite of dances lacking dramatic urgency, comic flair and Spanish style.</p>
        <p>In addition to Miss McDermott, Mr. Matz and Miss Pankova, the fine soloists included Jan Broeckx and Judith Turos, as a matador and the woman who loves him, and Anna Villadolid, Natalya Trokai and Tina-Kay Bohnstedt, as spirits in a vision scene. Everyone's dancing was technically admirable. Yet characterizations were minimal.</p>
        <p>Thomas Pekny's set designs were of no help whatsoever. Although Mr. Pekny did create a convincing book-lined study for Don Quixote and an imposing windmill, tall screens served as the scenery for most of the episodes. They were repeatedly rearranged in an attempt to suggest such locales as a marketplace and an inn. Unfortunately, no matter how they were placed onstage, they remained unrelievedly drab and made "Don Quixote" appear to be taking place in a void.</p>
        <p>This staging was certainly a demonstration of sound ballet pedagogy. But "Don Quixote" should also be a journey to a delightful corner of Spain that exists only in a comic theatrical imagination.</p>
