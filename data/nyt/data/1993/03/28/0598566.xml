        <p>AS difficult as it may be to monitor fat and cholesterol most of the year, at Passover, the holiday that celebrates the deliverance of the Jews from Egypt, and which begins at sundown April 5, it becomes a Sisyphean task. Starting with a traditional seder dinner, a ritual feast that ushers in the holiday, the observance continues for eight days and involves consuming no foods that contain a leavening other than eggs.</p>
        <p>Not only are eggs used in huge quantities to make feathery sponge cakes for the holiday dinners but they are also essential in preparing some other traditional dishes. The ground fish used for gefilte fish is held together with beaten egg and matzoh meal. Eggs are essential in making good chopped liver.</p>
        <p>Old-fashioned Passover breakfast dishes like puffy matzoh-meal pancakes and matzoh brei, an omeletlike mixture of eggs and pieces of matzoh fried together, are some other dishes that ignore the constraints of contemporary nutritional guidelines.</p>
        <p>Moderate indulgence, including a sampling of these yearly favorites at the seder and perhaps once during the holiday, is one approach. But for those who are reluctant to use egg yolks at all, substitutions are possible.</p>
        <p>Gefilte fish can be made with egg whites, as can chopped liver. The option for chopped liver is given in the following recipe. Angel food using just egg whites can take the place of sponge cake. And a dessert meringue made with only the whites can take the place of an egg-rich warm berry gratin. Both the meringue and gratin recipes are given. Chopped Liver</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>1/4 cup raw chicken fat, optional  2 cups finely sliced onions  1 pound chicken livers  1/2tablespoon vegetable oil (optional)  2 hard-cooked eggs, quartered, or 3 hard-cooked egg whites  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. If desired, place the chicken fat and two tablespoons of the onions in a small nonstick saucepan or skillet. Cook very slowly over low heat, stirring from time to time, until the fat is completely liquefied and the onions and resulting cracklings from the fat are golden brown.</p>
        <p>2. Remove from heat and strain fat into a small crock, pressing as much fat as possible from the onions and cracklings. Reserve the browned onions and cracklings.</p>
        <p>3. Place three tablespoons of the rendered fat in a large, heavy skillet and saute the remaining onions over medium-low heat until they are golden brown. Remove the onions from the pan, draining as much fat as possible back into the pan. As an alternate method, sweat the onions without fat by cooking them slowly in a tightly covered nonstick skillet with a little salt. When the onions are soft, remove the cover, increase the heat and allow them to become lightly browned.</p>
        <p>4. Trim the chicken livers of any connective tissue or membranes and pat dry with paper towels. Saute them over medium heat in the pan used for the onions, adding another tablespoon of chicken fat, or if no chicken fat is used, adding one-half tablespoon of vegetable oil. Cook the livers until they are lightly browned and no longer pink in the middle. Remove from the heat.</p>
        <p>5. Combine the livers, all the sauteed onions and hard-cooked eggs or egg whites, plus the cracklings, if desired, in a wooden bowl and chop them together by hand. The mixture can also be ground in a meat grinder using a medium blade. Alternately, the mixture can be chopped in a food processor. To do this, first cut the livers and eggs or egg whites into uniform one-half-inch pieces. Then mix them with the onions and cracklings in the bowl of the food processor and pulse briefly about five times, until the mixture has a uniform, medium-coarse texture. Do not make it smooth.</p>
        <p>6. Season the chopped liver to taste with salt and pepper and, if desired, with additional chicken fat. Place the chopped liver in a bowl or serving dish and cover it tightly with plastic wrap. Refrigerate if it is not being served within two to three hours, but allow it to come to room temperature before serving.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 to 12 servings Fresh Berry Gratin</p>
        <p>Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>1 pint raspberries  1pint strawberries  3/4 cup kosher for Passover sweet amaretto or other liqueur  6 egg yolks  1/3 cup sugar.</p>
        <p>1. Pick over the raspberries. Hull the strawberries and slice them in half. Mix the berries with two tablespoons of the liqueur. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>2. Place the egg yolks in a bowl that will fit over a pan of simmering water. Beat the egg yolks until they have thickened. Beat in one-quarter cup of the sugar. Set the bowl over a pan of simmering water and beat the mixture vigorously over low heat.</p>
        <p>3. Add half the remaining amaretto and continue beating. As the egg mixture thickens and lightens, gradually add the remaining amaretto. Continue beating the mixture until it is very thick and light, taking care to regulate the heat so the yolks do not coagulate.</p>
        <p>4. Remove the pan from the heat, stir the mixture again and refrigerate it until just before serving time.</p>
        <p>5. Preheat a broiler. Spread the berries in a shallow gratin dish at least nine inches in diameter. Spread the egg-yolk mixture over the berries, covering them completely. Sprinkle with the remaining sugar.</p>
        <p>6. Place the gratin under the broiler and cook for a minute or two, just until the top becomes brown and glazed. Place the gratin dish on a serving dish and serve at once, gently scooping portions of berries and gratin onto each plate.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings Fresh Berry Meringue</p>
        <p>Total time: 40 minutes</p>
        <p>1pint raspberries  1 pint strawberries, hulled and halved  4 tablespoons kosher for Passover amaretto liqueur  3/4 cup sugar  1/4 cup water  4 egg whites  Whole strawberries for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Mix the berries together in a bowl and toss gently with two tablespoons of the amaretto. Refrigerate.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the sugar and water in a small saucepan.</p>
        <p>3. Place the egg whites in a mixing bowl and beat just until they become frothy.</p>
        <p>4. Cook the sugar and water mixture until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture registers 237 degrees on a candy thermometer (soft ball stage). Remove from the heat.</p>
        <p>5. Beat the egg whites until they are softly peaked, then begin to drizzle in the sugar syrup in a thin stream, beating constantly. Continue beating until the egg whites are stiff and glossy. Fold in the remaining amaretto. Cover and refrigerate up to an hour, until just before serving time.</p>
        <p>6. Preheat oven to 500 degrees.</p>
        <p>7. Fold the berries into the meringue and spread the mixture in a gratin dish or a shallow baking dish. Place in the oven and bake about 10 minutes, until the meringue is puffy and lightly browned. Serve at once, garnished with whole strawberries.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
