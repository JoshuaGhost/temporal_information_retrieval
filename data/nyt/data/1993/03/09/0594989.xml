        <p>It was on March 16, 1968, that Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and tonight memories of that campaign will be evoked at a dinner for 260 people, numerous friends and associates of the Kennedy family among them, at the Pierre Hotel.</p>
        <p>Billed as a reunion, the dinner will raise the curtain on a series of 13 one-day conferences around the country entitled "A Vision for America." They start tomorrow at Columbia University, where his daughter KERRY KENNEDY CUOMO along with THOMAS F. McLARTY 3D, the White House chief of staff; former Senator HOWARD H. BAKER JR. and the historican ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER JR. will be among the speakers.</p>

        <p>It was on March 16, 1968, that Robert F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Democratic Presidential nomination, and tonight memories of that campaign will be evoked at a dinner for 260 people, numerous friends and associates of the Kennedy family among them, at the Pierre Hotel.</p>
        <p>Billed as a reunion, the dinner will raise the curtain on a series of 13 one-day conferences around the country entitled "A Vision for America." They start tomorrow at Columbia University, where his daughter KERRY KENNEDY CUOMO along with THOMAS F. McLARTY 3D, the White House chief of staff; former Senator HOWARD H. BAKER JR. and the historican ARTHUR M. SCHLESINGER JR. will be among the speakers.</p>
        <p>ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., who plans to be both participant and observer at the Columbia conference, said he did not expect the events to be sad, even though his father was killed during the campaign.</p>
        <p>"Clearly everyone in my family is touched by the idea that 25 years after his death, people still find resonance and relevance in the kind of vision he was trying to articulate," Mr. Kennedy said. "But this is not a sentimental gesture. My father was not the kind of person who spent a lot of time looking backward. I don't think that he would sanction an event looking back."</p>
        <p>In fact, he said his father would revel in the directions being taken by the Clinton Administration. "We now have a Democratic administration that, for the first time, is trying to pick up and restore his vision," he said. "And that is what the conferences will do: look ahead to meeting his goals."</p>
        <p>And how many Kennedys will assemble for the commemoration?  "There's no telling," he said. "My uncle Ted, my brother Joe, most of my 10 brothers and sisters, my cousins, including John and Caroline, will all be at one or both the dinner and conference."</p>
