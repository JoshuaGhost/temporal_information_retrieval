        <p>Social Security</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>If you return to work after receiving Social Security retirement benefits, will your benefits change when you stop working again?</p>
        <p>A. ROSENBLUTH, Manhattan A. Social Security retirement benefits are based on your lifetime average earnings. "If you claim retirement benefits and continue or return to work, the amounts you earn will be credited to your personal lifetime earnings record," said Joseph L. Matthews, author of "Social Security, Medicare and Pensions" (Thorndike Press, $22.95).</p>

        <p>Social Security</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>If you return to work after receiving Social Security retirement benefits, will your benefits change when you stop working again?</p>
        <p>A. ROSENBLUTH, Manhattan A. Social Security retirement benefits are based on your lifetime average earnings. "If you claim retirement benefits and continue or return to work, the amounts you earn will be credited to your personal lifetime earnings record," said Joseph L. Matthews, author of "Social Security, Medicare and Pensions" (Thorndike Press, $22.95).</p>
        <p>This means that when your earnings record changes, Social Security automatically recalculates your average earnings. So if the income you earn after having claimed retirement benefits increases your lifetime income average, your retirement benefits will also be recalculated upward. Commissions on Securities</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>How are the commissions figured on stock and bond purchases?</p>
        <p>STEPHAN A. LEOPOLD, Manhattan A. Commissions on stock purchases at full-service brokers depend on the number of shares and the total dollar size of the transaction. "They range typically from under 1 percent for 200 shares at $110 to as high as 5.5 percent for 2000 shares at $2," said Madeline I. Noveck, chairman of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners.</p>
        <p>Discount brokers offer discounts of 20 to 90 percent from the commissions charged by full-service brokers, although the latter may be negotiable. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires that the exact amount be reported to you on your confirmation slip.</p>
        <p>In most cases, there is no separate commission on bonds, which are usually sold to customers from a bond dealer's inventory. And dealers do not disclose their markup on these sales. To find out the difference, or spread, between the buy price and the sell price, get a bid from another dealer, since the selling dealer is unlikely to tell you.</p>
        <p>Savings Bond Interest</p>
        <p>Q.</p>
        <p>I own a large number of E bonds purchased from payroll deductions that date from 1962 through 1974. How long will they continue to earn interest and what is the rate of interest?</p>
        <p>LEONARD RATNER, Manhattan A. Series E United States Savings Bonds issued from 1941 through November 1965 earn interest for 40 years. Bonds issued subsequently earn interest for 30 years.</p>
        <p>In November 1982, a program was instituted under which bonds earn either a market-based variable rate if held at least five years or a guaranteed minimum rate -- whichever is higher.  Older bonds were grandfathered into this program at the rate prevailing at the time they went into an extension or at the average market-based rate applying to bonds purchased before November 1982, which is 7 3/4 percent.</p>
        <p>"All of your bonds are earning that amount for this period because the average is overriding their minimum rates, which are either 4 percent, 6 percent or 7 1/2 percent, depending on the issue date," said Richard J. Schneebeli, deputy executive director of United States Savings Bonds.</p>
