        <p>For South Africa's blacks, and probably the outside world, the real end of apartheid is imagined in a single image: the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the country's next president. The thought that President Mandela's Cabinet might include the likes of his white predecessor, F.W. de Klerk, and the petulant Zulu conservative, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is a new and jarring addition to the picture.</p>
        <p>The prospect is real. Mr. Mandela's African National Congress last week endorsed a five-year "government of national unity" in which any party proving 5 percent support at the polls would win not only parliamentary seats, but a voice in the executive branch.</p>

        <p>For South Africa's blacks, and probably the outside world, the real end of apartheid is imagined in a single image: the inauguration of Nelson Mandela as the country's next president. The thought that President Mandela's Cabinet might include the likes of his white predecessor, F.W. de Klerk, and the petulant Zulu conservative, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, is a new and jarring addition to the picture.</p>
        <p>The prospect is real. Mr. Mandela's African National Congress last week endorsed a five-year "government of national unity" in which any party proving 5 percent support at the polls would win not only parliamentary seats, but a voice in the executive branch.</p>
        <p>There is something big-spirited about a transition from a government of cruel exclusion to one of broad embrace, but the motivation -- as congress leaders were at pains to persuade their more militant members -- is pragmatic. With this compromise congress leaders hope to hasten a negotiated end of white rule, and to quell white panic and resistance later on.</p>
        <p>Now comes the hard sell. As the focus returns to multi-party talks next month, Mr. de Klerk must convince his white followers, and Mr. Buthelezi, that the deal assures them a meaningful share of power. Mr. Mandela must convince his people that it does not betray their goal of majority rule.</p>
