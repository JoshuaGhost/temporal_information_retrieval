        <p>A 14-year-old Brooklyn boy was shot to death yesterday, apparently accidentally, when a revolver he and three friends were playing went off, striking him in the left eye, the police reported. Sgt. John McCluskey, a police spokesman, identified the youth as Jimmy Gonzales of 191 Amboy Street.</p>
        <p>The incident took place yesterday afternoon in the apartment of one of the friends, at 196 Throop Avenue, in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The police said that the three hid the body of the dead youth under a bed, and that one called police late last night. The three, who were not identified, were being questioned early this morning.</p>
