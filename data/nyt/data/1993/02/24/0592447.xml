        <p>It's a tough chair to fill, but someone's got to sit in it.</p>
        <p>Three months after Alistair Cooke ever so politely bade goodbye to "Masterpiece Theater," the show's sponsors announced yesterday that Russell Baker would become the program's new host.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in the "library" of the Palace Hotel in Manhattan, Mr. Baker, surrounded by fake books, assured reporters that he would not allow his irreverent style to impinge on the highbrow tone of "Masterpiece Theater." In the case of an episode that is "egregiously ridiculous," though, he acknowledged, "a little needle might be apropos."</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker, who is 67 and a New York Times columnist, said he had first been approached about taking Mr. Cooke's place almost a year ago. He demurred.</p>
        <p>"My reply was I'd like to be the man who succeeds the man who succeeds Alistair Cooke," he said. But several months went by, and Mr. Baker's self-esteem improved to the point where, he said, "I thought, 'Why not give it a try?' " He added that is was particularly influenced by his daughter, Kasia, who urged him to get out of his "rut," and by a desire to fulfill his destiny as a citizen: "In America, if you're not on television, somehow you're not American," he said.  Hundreds Were Considered</p>
        <p>Rebecca Eaton, the executive producer of "Masterpiece Theater," said Mr. Baker had been chosen from among hundreds of actors, journalists, historians and aristocrats who had been considered for the job, and dozens more who had sent in unsolicited tapes.</p>
        <p>"We knew it when we found it," she said of Mr. Baker, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of more than a dozen books.</p>
        <p>In spite of his new duties as host, which he is to assume in the fall, Mr. Baker will continue to write his "Observer" column for The Times. Mr. Baker will be only the second regular host of "Masterpiece Theater," the nation's longest-running prime-time drama series. Mr. Cooke, who held the position since the show's inception in 1971, announced his retirement in July. Since he left the show in November, guest hosts have filled in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cooke and his genteel English manner became so closely identified with "Masterpiece Theater" that the news of his American successor yesterday seemed to suggest not so much a passing of the torch as a passing of an era. Mr. Baker took pains, however, to reassure reporters that he enjoyed the kind of long, rambling 19th-century novels favored by "Masterpiece Theater's" producers, and that in any case he did not plan to have any influence on the content of show. But he said, "I certainly hope we'll do Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past.' "</p>
        <p>"Masterpiece Theatre" is sponsored by the Mobil Corporation and presented by WGBH, the public television station in Boston. The programs in the series are usually purchased from British producers.  A Longtime Fan</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker, who lives in Virginia, said he was a fan of "Masterpiece Theater," and had watched most of the shows. He listed among his favorites "The Golden Bowl," "Jeeves and Wooster" and "Memento Mori." Under closer questioning, he also acknowledged that he was a fan of the afternoon soap opera "All My Children."</p>
        <p>As interpreted by Mr. Cooke, the duties of the host were to introduce the show and offer a few closing comments. Mr. Baker said viewers should not expect radical changes. "It's a mistake to make brave assertions about how original you're going to be," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker said he was succeeding Mr. Cooke in a spirit of humility: "You enter, as George Bush would say, in a prayer mode."</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 25, 1993, Thursday</p>
        <p>A front-page picture caption in The Living Section yesterday, with a cross reference to an article about Russell Baker's selection as host of "Masterpiece Theater," omitted the identity of the girl with Mr. Baker. She was his granddaughter Laura Baker.</p>
