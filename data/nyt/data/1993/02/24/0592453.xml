        <p>A Harvard Exhibition</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A Harvard Exhibition</p>
        <p>No Food in the Library," an exhibition about the ways food has affected life throughout history, will be on display at the Widener Library of Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., from March 8 through April 30. The displays will include works of art, books, photographs and food packages.</p>
        <p>On March 7 at noon, the Radcliffe Culinary Friends will sponsor a preview of the show and a lecture whose title, "Eating Our Words," is in keeping with the tongue-in-cheek title of the exhibition. The lecture, by Barbara Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, a professor of performance arts at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, is scheduled at 2 P.M. A reception, at the Inn at Harvard, follows from 4 to 6 P.M.</p>
        <p>A ticket for all the Sunday events is $25 for adults, and $12.50 for retired people, students and members of Radcliffe Culinary Friends. Tickets are available from Radcliffe Culinary Friends, 10 Garden Street, Cambridge 02138; (617) 495-8647.</p>
        <p>Through the end of April, related shows will take place at other places on the Harvard campus, among them "Images of Food in Russian Art," "Food in Jewish Tradition" and "The Political Cookbook." Admission to "No Food in the Library" is free beginning March 8. Olive Oil 101</p>
        <p>This afternoon from 2:30 to 4 P.M., the Italian Trade Commission, at 499 Park Avenue (59th Street), is giving a free public presentation about olive oil. There will be an explanation of how olive oil is made and graded, a tasting of La Giara olive oils from Calabria, the "toe" of Italy, along with some wines from the region.</p>
        <p>Dr. Louis Aronne, the director of the Weight Control Program of New York Hospital, will talk about health and the Mediterranean diet. Rearranged Fairway</p>
        <p>Some of the furniture has been rearranged at Fairway Market, 2127 Broadway (74th Street). In this store that made its reputation selling produce, the prepared food departments are expanding faster than those for fruits and vegetables, and the changes accommodate that development.</p>
        <p>An expanded bread counter now sits in the back of the store where prepared foods were once situated. Prepared foods now occupy a larger space in the left-rear corner, which includes the former bread area. There is a wider assortment of prepared foods, and most are made on the premises.</p>
        <p>Coffees and onions have been replaced by a big free-standing unit with self-service hot food on one side, salad-bar-style, and with containers of prepacked salads on the other. Coffees are now ground and sold on the left side toward the rear of the store. To Travel. To Eat. To Read.</p>
        <p>Palate and Spirit, a new quarterly published in San Francisco, covers culinary travel. It offers a useful seasonal directory of more than 100 culinary tours, food and wine programs at resorts and hotels, and cooking and wine schools around the world.</p>
        <p>The inaugural issue of this unusual magazine, color coordinated in Roquefort blue and pumpkin, also includes articles about how Julia Child began her cooking career, a cooking class on a cruise ship, food on an African safari and eating in Hong Kong. Tour companies, hotels and cooking schools provide the advertising support.</p>
        <p>The regular subscription price is $49 for four issues, but an introductory price of $36 is available. More information can be obtained from Palate and Spirit, 2443 Filmore Street, Suite 347, San Francisco 94115; (800) 824-4737. Asia in Hudson Valley</p>
        <p>On March 5, 6 and 7, the heat at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., will come not only from the many wood-burning fireplaces on the premises but also from the food. Spicy Asian fare will be served at mealtimes and demonstrated in cooking classes between meals.</p>
        <p>Binh Duong, a Vietnamese chef and cookbook author; Gloria Zimmerman, a cookbook author and consultant on Thai and Vietnamese food, and Dave DeWitt, the editor of Chili Pepper magazine, are some of the experts who will conduct seminars and cooking demonstrations.</p>
        <p>Room rates, including three meals and seminars, range from $155 to $320 a night. Reservations for the weekend can be made by calling (800) 773-6646 or, in the 914 area code, 255-4500.</p>
        <p>PASTA OF THE PHARAOHS?</p>
        <p>ANTHROPOLOGISTS know that the builders of the Egyptian pyramids ate garlic.  And perhaps it was served with pasta. If so, the pasta may have been made from kamut (pronounced ka-MOOT), an ancestor of durum wheat that is now used to make commercial pasta products.</p>
        <p>Kamut elbows, spirals and the like are $1.50 to $2 for 12 ounces in health food stores. Eden and Cleopatra are two brands.</p>
        <p>The pasta has a more assertive taste than the regular durum types but is not as aggressive as whole wheat. It has more calcium than regular durum pasta and, according to the International Food Allergy Association, is less likely to cause a reaction in people sensitive to regular wheat.</p>
