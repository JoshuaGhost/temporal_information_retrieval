        <p>The Clinton Administration issued a visa today to Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs and a man former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger listed as a possible war criminal.</p>
        <p>The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today that the visa was issued to Dr. Kradzic to allow him to take part in negotiations on a peace treaty for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the United Nations headquarters in New York. The type of visa issued Dr. Karadzic normally restricts the recipient to a 25-mile radius from the United Nations headquarters. He will not be subject to arrest on war crimes charges while he is here.</p>

        <p>The Clinton Administration issued a visa today to Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs and a man former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger listed as a possible war criminal.</p>
        <p>The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said today that the visa was issued to Dr. Kradzic to allow him to take part in negotiations on a peace treaty for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the United Nations headquarters in New York. The type of visa issued Dr. Karadzic normally restricts the recipient to a 25-mile radius from the United Nations headquarters. He will not be subject to arrest on war crimes charges while he is here.</p>
        <p>In the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton had advocated taking a more muscular stance toward Serbian aggression in Bosnia, and after the November election, he embraced President Bush's policy on war crimes. Asked if the Clinton Administration stands by Mr. Eagleburger's characterization of Dr. Karadzic, Mr. Boucher said today, "We continue to believe that this man has things that he has to answer for." Talks Moved From Geneva</p>
        <p>Mr. Boucher said the visa was granted at the request of Cyrus R. Vance and Lord Owen, leaders of a joint United Nations-European Community mediation effort in Bosnia. Mr. Vance and Lord Owen moved those talks from Geneva to New York on Monday.</p>
        <p>The State Department issues C-2 visas to officials from governments not recognized by the United States. Under a 1947 agreement establishing the United Nations headquarters in New York, the United States is obliged to issue visas to officials having business at the United Nations even if the United States does not extend diplomatic recognition to their governments.</p>
        <p>On Monday five Republican Senators sent a letter to Mr. Christopher urging him not to extend the visa to Dr. Karadzic. The letter was signed by Senators Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Larry Pressler of South Dakota, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and the Minority Leader, Bob Dole of Kansas. 'Bothers Me a Great Deal'</p>
        <p>"It bothers me a great deal," Mr. Pressler said today when asked about the granting of the visa. "We're giving up an opportunity to really express ourselves, to show some backbone. It's just business as usual."</p>
        <p>The issue of granting visas to officials of governments or movements the United States considers pariah has surfaced from time to time, principally involving Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>The United States forbids the principal P.L.O. officers to enter the United States to conduct business at the United Nations, though it gives the Secretary of State the power to waive that prohibition. Such a waiver was granted to Mr. Arafat in 1974.</p>
