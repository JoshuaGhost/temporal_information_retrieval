        <p>The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which restored some legal remedies for employment discrimination and expanded others, applies retroactively to the thousands of cases that were pending when President George Bush reluctantly signed it into law.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration took the view that the new law applied only to cases filed after Nov. 21, 1991, when the law went into effect, and most lower Federal courts have agreed.

        <p>The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which restored some legal remedies for employment discrimination and expanded others, applies retroactively to the thousands of cases that were pending when President George Bush reluctantly signed it into law.</p>
        <p>The Bush Administration took the view that the new law applied only to cases filed after Nov. 21, 1991, when the law went into effect, and most lower Federal courts have agreed. The Clinton Administration has not taken a position but will almost certainly do so before the two cases that the Court accepted today are argued next fall.</p>
        <p>The 1991 law overturned eight Supreme Court decisions, most from 1989, that restricted the application of existing Federal civil rights laws. Initially vetoed by Mr. Bush, the legislation was the product of a two-year, intensely partisan battle that left each side lacking the strength to prevail on the retroactivity question. As a result, the version that Mr. Bush finally signed did not specify whether the law was to be given retroactive effect.</p>
        <p>The Court itself has struggled for years over how to interpret Congressional silence on retroactivity and may well use these cases to adopt a general approach to the question. Two contradictory precedents are on the Court's books: one presumes a new law to be retroactive unless Congress has specified otherwise; the other presumes a law to have a prospective effect only, unless Congress has explicitly called for retroactivity.</p>
        <p>The two cases the Court accepted today are both appeals filed by workers who unsuccessfully sued their employers for discrimination before the 1991 law took effect, and who then failed to persuade Federal appellate courts that their cases should be reviewed under the more generous standards of the new law.</p>
        <p>One case, Rivers v. Roadway Express, No. 92-938, was brought by two black men who said their employer had subjected them to racially discriminatory disciplinary proceedings that led to their dismissal. They filed their suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, in which the Reconstruction-era Congress guaranteed to newly freed blacks the same right to "make and enforce contracts" as white workers enjoyed.</p>
        <p>One of the Supreme Court's 1989 decisions, Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, held that this law applied only to the initial contract of employment and not to any discrimination that occurred on the job. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 overruled that decision by specifying that the old law applied throughout the term of employment. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, upheld the dismissal of this aspect of the black workers' case on the ground that the 1991 law was not retroactive.</p>
        <p>The plaintiff in the second case, Landgraf v. USI Film Products, No. 92-757, is a woman who charged her employer with failing to protect her from a sexual harassment by a co-worker. She sued under another Federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
        <p>When the woman, Barbara Landraf, brought her lawsuit in 1989, Title VII did not permit a jury trial and provided for back pay as the only monetary remedy. The judge who heard her case ruled that although the woman had been sexually harassed, the employer had dealt properly with the problem. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 amended Title VII to provide for a jury trial as well as for the possibility of compensatory and punitive damages. On appeal, Ms. Landgraf sought a new trial under the new law, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, refused to apply the 1991 law retroactively.</p>
        <p>Of the eight Federal appellate courts to address the issue so far, only one, the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, has found the new law to be retroactive. That ruling last fall, while not itself before the Court, is probably what persuaded the Justices of the need to settle the issue. Before the Ninth Circuit ruled, the Supreme Court had turned down several Civil Rights Act cases and it appeared the Justices would be content to leave the question to the lower courts as long as all were in agreement.</p>
        <p>Returning today from a monthlong recess, the Court disposed of some 600 cases, granting review in seven and turning down nearly all the others. Among the Court's other actions today were these: Redistricting</p>
        <p>The Court agreed to review the 1992 redistricting of the Florida Legislature in a case that could define the obligation of legislatures and courts to provide the maximum possible number of districts for minorities.</p>
        <p>The Justices are already reviewing three redistricting cases in this term, from Ohio, Minnesota and North Carolina. The Florida case raises most directly the question of the degree to which Congress meant to incorporate notions of racial and ethnic proportional representation in the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The amendments, which gave minorities new grounds for challenging apportionment, are now being applied on a broad scale for the first time in the redistricting made necessary by the 1990 census.</p>
        <p>In the Florida case, black and Hispanic residents of Dade County, with the support of the Justice Department, sought increased representation. Both groups challenged the Legislature's redistricting plan for the State Senate, which created three Dade County districts with a majority population of Hispanic voters and two districts with a black majority.</p>
        <p>Each group argued to a special three-judge panel of the Federal District Court in Tallahassee that it should have received an additional district. The court agreed that each group was entitled to the extra seat under the Voting Rights Act, but declined to order new redistricting on the ground that it could not find a fair balance between the competing claims.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court today agreed to hear the Justice Department's appeal of that ruling, United States v. Florida, No. 92-767, which argues that the lower court should have made a greater effort to accommodate the two minority interests before concluding that such an effort was doomed to failure.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Court agreed to hear Florida's appeal from the portion of the lower court's ruling that address the redistricting of the Florida House of Representatives (Wetherell v. de Grandy, No. 92-519). The original plan provided for 9 of the 18 Dade County seats to have Hispanic majorities.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department entered the case on behalf of Hispanic officials who argued that the Hispanic community was numerically entitled to 11 seats. The lower court agreed, and ordered a new plan with 11 Hispanic districts. The Supreme Court ordered a stay of that ruling last summer, with the result that the 1992 elections were conducted under the state's original plan.</p>
        <p>In its appeal, the state argues that the enhanced Hispanic representation has adverse consequences for blacks and Jews in Dade County. The Supreme Court today granted a request by the American Jewish Congress to file a brief in the case. That brief argues that the Voting Rights Act should not be used as a tool to maximize the power of some groups at the expense of others.</p>
        <p>In an unrelated redistricting case today, the Court unanimously upheld a redistricting plan for Alabama's seven Congressional districts that was put into effect last year by a three-judge Federal panel in Mobile. The plan created one majority black district, from which Earl F. Hilliard, the first black member of Congress from Alabama since Reconstruction, was elected in November.</p>
        <p>A group of black officials and voters, supported by the Justice Department's civil rights division, had argued that a second majority black district should have been created. But the Bush Administration refused to back that position and urged the Court to uphold the lower court's action. The Court did not issue a formal opinion today (Figures v. Hunt, No. 91-1992). Frozen Embryos</p>
        <p>Without comment, the Court turned down an appeal by a Tennessee woman who sought custody of seven embryos, each containing four to eight cells, that had been frozen by a fertility clinic as part of an effort to help her and her husband have a baby.</p>
        <p>The couple, Mary Sue Davis and Junior Davis, were divorced before they used the embryos. The matter ended up in state court after the two could not agree on what to do with the embryos, which Mrs. Davis said she wanted to donate to infertile couples.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis argued that he had a constitutional right not to become a father against his will. Last year the Tennessee Supreme Court agreed with him in an opinion that authorized the clinic to discard the embryos if the two could not agree on using them for research.</p>
        <p>In her appeal, Mrs. Davis, now Mary Sue Stowe, argued that the embryos were human beings. As legal authority for that assertion, she cited a 1988 White House statement in which President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the "unalienable personhood of every American from the moment of conception." (Stowe v. Davis, No. 92-910). Kosher Regulation</p>
        <p>The Court refused to hear an appeal from a ruling by the New Jersey Supreme Court that found unconstitutional the state's enforcement of consumer fraud regulations against sellers of kosher food.</p>
        <p>Under a regulation defining kosher food as food "prepared and maintained in strict compliance with the laws and customs of the Orthodox Jewish religion," New Jersey's Bureau of Kosher Enforcement enforced the law with the advice of a board of 10 rabbis.</p>
        <p>The State Supreme Court, ruling in a suit brought by a kosher food merchant who ran afoul of the regulations, held that under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, "the state can neither impose religious rules nor endorse religious norms. (National Jewish Commission on Law &amp; Public Affairs v. Ran-Dav's, No. 92-1053.) Pesticides</p>
        <p>The Court refused to hear an appeal by the pesticide industry from a ruling requiring strict application of the Delaney Clause, which dates to 1958 and prohibits food additives that pose any risk of cancer, however small.</p>
