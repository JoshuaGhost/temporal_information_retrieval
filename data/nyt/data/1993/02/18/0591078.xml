        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We share A. M. Rosenthal's sense of solidarity with immigrants in "Aliens: Let Them Work" (column, Feb. 9). A nation of immigrants, the United States has at various stages of history turned its back on its best self and let its fearful face show. Xenophobia and racism -- both strong currents in American life -- often combine in the making of immigration policy.</p>
        <p>The American Friends Service Committee and many others who work closely with today's immigrant communities opposed employer sanctions when the 1986 immigration law was under consideration. Our fundamental objection to the proposed law was that we saw the sanctions provision as a denial of a strong religious tradition in this country that calls on us to welcome the stranger.</p>
        <p>We saw the employer-sanctions provision as leading to discrimination in hiring by employers, who would reject a foreign-looking applicant, rather than risk hiring undocumented people. Such has proved to be the case. We saw the provision as leading to a market in forged documents. Such a market thrives.</p>
        <p>We saw the employer-sanctions provision creating a highly vulnerable group of employees, unable to protect themselves from economic exploitation and other abuse. This has come to pass: witness the new sweatshops across the country.</p>
        <p>We saw the law as asking employers to be part of a governmental effort designed to starve immigrants out, to drive them home again and to deter others from coming -- to become, as Mr. Rosenthal says, "an unpaid work-police."</p>
        <p>The issues immigration policy seeks to address would be better dealt with by investment in enforcement of labor laws concerning fair wages and working conditions for all workers, documented or undocumented, meaningful foreign debt relief and international economic cooperation directed to achieve sustainable development. Let us welcome the stranger. Let us repeal employer sanctions. BARBARA W. MOFFETT  Natl. Community Relations Secy. American Friends Service Committee Philadelphia, Feb. 10, 1993</p>
