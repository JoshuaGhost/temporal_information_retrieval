        <p>THE Internal Revenue Service reckons it might take a full weekend to run the tax-filing marathon this spring: 20 hours or more to gather records, read the rules and fill out a typical pile of forms.</p>
        <p>But the motto of the fitness enthusiast -- no pain, no gain -- may be equally appropriate in the realm of personal finance.</p>
        <p>The exercise of filing one's taxes provides an ideal opportunity for some detailed planning, taking advantage of the clear picture of one's financial state that should emerge from the ordeal.</p>
        <p>"Things of this nature are good to put people through," said Wesley Fitzpatrick, a tax partner at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. "What they learn from it is very valuable. But it is hard to convince them of that."</p>
        <p>Is it possible to learn to stop worrying and love April 15?</p>
        <p>I.R.S. officials believe it is. In the last year or two, the agency has been striving to relieve the anxiety that many people have long felt about doing their taxes. That means trying to make the inherently complex system simpler, but also, in a transformation of the agency's personality, taking a forgiving attitude to honest mistakes and offering easier terms to those whose tax bills have gotten out of control.</p>
        <p>Doing your taxes means more than itemizing the past. It also means thinking about the future, all the more important with the expected changes in tax law and administration. No one can predict how much of President Clinton's tax and deficit reduction program will be adopted by Congress, but it can be assumed that tax rates will go up for affluent Americans and that most families will pay more, either in income tax or an energy tax or both.</p>
        <p>There will also be changes in the way the I.R.S. works as a new commissioner, nominated last week by Mr. Clinton, takes hold and puts her own stamp on the agency. She is Margaret M. Richardson, a Washington tax lawyer.</p>
        <p>For 1992, however, there are relatively few substantial changes in the tax code to worry about.</p>
        <p>"The firm used to prepare these year-end planning guides, but a couple of years ago we stopped doing that because things were staying about the same," said Larry Foster, a tax partner at KPMG Peat Marwick.</p>
        <p>Tax rates have not changed for 1992, and indeed the three basic tax brackets (15 percent, 28 percent and 31 percent) each cover slightly higher incomes. That is because of the indexation of taxes, designed to stop "bracket creep" as people's incomes rise along with inflation.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the 1992 deduction for each exemption -- yourself, your spouse, your other dependents -- went up by $150, to $2,300. The standard deduction, for people who do not itemize, increased to $6,000 for couples filing joint returns and $3,600 for single people.</p>
        <p>For some people, indexation means that it no longer makes sense to itemize deductions, especially since a few widely used deductions have gone out the window.</p>
        <p>For example, the home office deduction is disappearing for many taxpayers, because of a Supreme Court decision that makes it harder for people to qualify.</p>
        <p>Other tax breaks that disappeared in mid-1992, but might yet be restored retroactively, are the exclusion from income of tuition paid by employers for education not related to work and the partial deduction of medical insurance costs for self-employed people.</p>
        <p>Important changes in the tax law this year are spelled out in I.R.S. Publication 553, "Highlights of 1992 Tax Changes." Like other publications and forms you may need, it can be obtained by calling 1-800-TAX-FORM.</p>
        <p>TAX law is full of surprises for those who fall into old habits. The best example may be the decision by married couples to file jointly rather than separately. Although this usually makes sense, it is wise to experiment by drafting separate returns.</p>
        <p>People who file jointly lump their incomes together, but also their deductions; handling income and deductions for each spouse separately can have important benefits.</p>
        <p>It can happen when one partner earns much more than the other, when one spouse has high medical bills or miscellaneous deductions, or when income is high enough to trigger the reductions in itemized deductions and personal exemptions that since 1991 have applied to many wealthier taxpayers.</p>
        <p>For example, medical expenses can be deducted only if they exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income, the amount of income subject to taxes before itemized deductions are subtracted. If a husband earns $40,000 and his wife $30,000, only their medical costs above $5,250 may be deducted from a joint return. But if their baby's birth costs $1,000 out of pocket, and the wife spent $3,000 on premiums for the family's medical policy, they might want to file separately, so she can deduct $1,750 -- the amount by which the expenses exceeded 7.5 percent of her income.</p>
        <p>The husband might then be able to write off some of his $1,000 union dues, along with the cost of his work uniforms and his unreimbursed business expenses. These are miscellaneous itemized deductions, which can be deducted only to the extent that they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income -- in his case, more than $800.</p>
        <p>There are a few new traps scattered across this year's tax course. One that will trip many people: inadequate payroll withholding after President Bush last year ordered changes in withholding tables in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending.</p>
        <p>Many people escaped underwithholding by adjusting their W-4 forms; those who now want to do so should use Form 919: "Is My Withholding Correct for 1993?"</p>
        <p>In another new twist, people who bought or sold a house using a loan from the seller must report the transaction in more detail. The parties must exchange each other's Social Security numbers to help the I.R.S. verify the interest deduction taken by one and the interest income earned by the other.</p>
        <p>The buyer is to report this information on Schedule A and the seller on Schedule B. But tax documents printed before the change took effect do not take this into account. There will be no penalty for failure to report the information properly this year, but it must be done beginning next year, so people should obtain the necessary data anyway.</p>
        <p>Another change has just arrived for people posted temporarily away from home on business. They may deduct unreimbursed living expenses; but beginning in 1993, assignments that are expected to last more than one year do not qualify.</p>
        <p>SOMEONE living in Boston who was dispatched to Los Angeles for 15 months beginning in July 1992 can deduct the travel, hotel and other costs on his 1992 return, but this year's expenses won't be deductible.</p>
        <p>And there are new limits on depreciation for automobiles put into use in 1992 for business purposes. The new limit in the first year is $2,760. (It will be $4,400 in the second year, $2,650 in the third year, and $1,575 in each later year.) Business mileage is now deductible at 28 cents per mile.</p>
        <p>Some changes make filing simpler this year. For the smallest of businesses, there is a new Schedule C-EZ, for reporting business income or loss, that should take little time to fill out. And in a change of position, the I.R.S. now allows sole proprietors who file Schedule C to deduct some of their tax preparation expenses from their business income, which provides a bigger tax reduction.</p>
        <p>Electronic filing is another improvement for many individuals. You can fill out your own return and take it to a tax professional who will file it electronically for a small fee. It cuts down on errors and speeds the refund.</p>
        <p>These are just a few signs of what I.R.S. officials say will be the agency's increasingly friendly face. This fall, the agency took many of its agents off the tax-enforcement trail and assigned them instead to helping bring back into the fold some of the estimated 10 million people who don't file tax returns at all.</p>
        <p>About a quarter of these people are actually owed refunds; the rest will be treated leniently if they come forward voluntarily, the agency promises. Its goal: to collect billions of back taxes, increase future collections, and avoid costly enforcement actions.</p>
        <p>Even taxpayers who can't afford to pay what they owe can fill out Form 9465, requesting to pay in installments. Any reasonable proposal is likely to be considered.  YOUR TAXES</p>
