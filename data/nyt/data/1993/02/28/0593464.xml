        <p>THE weather outside is frightful, but inside the factory of Westchester Modular Homes in Wingdale, N.Y., workers are building houses as if it were summer.</p>
        <p>"Because we control the climate, we have no down time, no season in which we can't build," said Steven Kerr, vice president of sales and marketing of Westchester Modular Homes, which is named for Westchester County even though the factory is in Dutchess County. "We're able to produce more than one house every day that the factory is open, or 350 houses projected for this year, as compared to the 10 or 12 a year of a builder using conventional stick building -- piece-by-piece construction."</p>

        <p>THE weather outside is frightful, but inside the factory of Westchester Modular Homes in Wingdale, N.Y., workers are building houses as if it were summer.</p>
        <p>"Because we control the climate, we have no down time, no season in which we can't build," said Steven Kerr, vice president of sales and marketing of Westchester Modular Homes, which is named for Westchester County even though the factory is in Dutchess County. "We're able to produce more than one house every day that the factory is open, or 350 houses projected for this year, as compared to the 10 or 12 a year of a builder using conventional stick building -- piece-by-piece construction."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerr, explaining how the factory system shortens construction time, said the process incorporates a core of modular components that are easily finished or augmented with premanufactured panels.</p>
        <p>"A lot of building goes on at once," he said. "While a team of workers builds a flooring system, another team is finishing the wall systems that are eventually mounted on the floors by cranes. All the electrical, plastering and flooring is completed on the factory floor. Because the lumber, dry-wall and insulation materials we use don't absorb excess moisture, you don't have a drying-out period, which is common in stick-built houses. You will never find doors warping in a factory-built house."</p>
        <p>And yet, no two houses produced by Westchester Modular are alike, Mr. Kerr said, eager to dispel the trailer-park image that equates modular construction, once called prefabricated construction, with mobile homes.</p>
        <p>"We've already sold three customized modular homes that retail for over $1 million apiece," he said. "They have features most people don't associate with modular homes, such as two-story entries, cathedral ceilings, huge open kitchens, master bathrooms with Jacuzzi and exercise rooms attached, and three- and four-car garages." Company Started in 1986</p>
        <p>The company was started in 1986 by two Westchester builder-developers, Charles W. Hatcher and Thomas F. Flood 3d, who began building custom homes in Chappaqua and Armonk in 1970, using traditional stick construction.</p>
        <p>"However, when we started multi-house building in 1984 for a planned 120-unit development in Somers, we decided that modular construction would give us more control over our costs, quality and scheduling," Mr. Hatcher said. "We shopped seven modular companies in the Northeast with our plans and designs in hand, but not one of them could accommodate us. Six were so inflexible they could not, or would not, modify their floor plans for us, and while the seventh was able to give us a customized design, the quality of the construction left a lot to be desired."</p>
        <p>The partners came away believing that in order to get what they wanted they would have to build their own modular factory.</p>
        <p>"Visiting the other modular factories was an eye-opener," Mr. Hatcher recalled. "We saw the floors in the companies we visited, and we thought we could do better. We also thought there were other builders like us who wanted modulars that were flexible enough for customized projects. So we made a big commitment. We already had the land for the factory. Then we went head hunting for the best people we could find to work in it." An Expensive Undertaking</p>
        <p>Building the factory, buying equipment and recruiting key people required a large outlay of money. "It was a huge capital-intensive undertaking," Mr. Hatcher said, "but it was the only way we could get the products we needed, and we were convinced that with the technology now available, modular construction is the wave of the future for the home-building industry, so we made the commitment."</p>
        <p>The houses are built by hand -- by carpenters, electricians, plumbers and roofers, in compliance with all nationally accepted building codes, national electrical codes and state and local building codes, Mr. Hatcher said. Each stage of construction is monitored by a quality-control manager.  15-Year Warranty Offered</p>
        <p>"In general, modulars undergo more rigorous inspections than conventionally built houses," he said. "Each house is also inspected by an independent outside inspection agency that certifies that each home is built in accordance with the approved plan of the state it is going to. We back every house we produce with a full 15-year written warranty on all modular components." The houses are built and shipped 90 to 95 percent complete to the site on company-owned delivery trucks. Two of the company's houses have also gone by barge to Nantucket Island, Mr. Kerr said. Once a house is installed on its site, a crew makes sure it is weathertight, and sometimes other finishing touches, like shingles, are added.  "The biggest constraint to modular homes was size, because they have to be transported across highways," he said. "But with the new technology, we can fold down steep roofs, and it's quite a sight to see how the cranes raise the roof after the house is set on the foundation. Our crews accompany every house and set up the modulars and make them all weathertight at the site." 30 Percent of the Market</p>
        <p>From the company's perspective, a good builder is important to the success of a modular manufacturer, said Mr. Kerr, adding that that is why the modular houses are sold by 89 builders in 9 Northeast states. "The builders have to pass our muster because we put ourselves on the line by giving a 15-year warranty," he said. "When people come to us with their plans, we put them in touch with our builder in their area. There are two builders in Westchester now; eventually we will have four."</p>
        <p>One of the builders in Westchester is A. Amnon Gitelson, a builder and developer and head of A. W. Development in Yorktown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gitelson said that about 70 percent of the houses he builds are conventional stick construction; the other 30 percent are made from modular components.  Speeding Up Construction</p>
        <p>"One of the big advantages of modular building is that it is much faster," Mr. Gitelson said. "Especially now, when the market is slow, people want to sell before they buy a new house. We can produce a modular house in three months, which means they don't have to rent a house in the interim." Although it takes only a week or so to build the modules in the factory, it takes up to three months to build the foundation on the site, put in a driveway, deliver the modules and complete installation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gitelson said that in some houses modular does have certain limitations. "If you have a very large product for a very sophisticated customer, modular will not always work," he said. "But the customization of modular is very attractive for the Westchester market."</p>
        <p>Ninety percent of the modular homes produced in the Westchester Modular factory are customized.  "We have six engineers on staff who work with builders and architects on custom projects," Mr. Hatcher said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kerr said that factory-produced houses cost about $35 to $45 a square foot, exclusive of land and foundation, or 15 to 22 percent less than the same house would cost using traditional methods.</p>
        <p>"The opportunity for cost savings is even greater at the upper end of the scale," Mr. Kerr said, because the more customization there is on a stick-built home, the more opportunity for the builder to lose control of his costs."  Big Windows and Peak Roofs</p>
        <p>One Westchester Modular home is a handsome gray Colonial parsonage behind the Presbyterian Church in Mount Kisco. It is the new home of the Rev. Douglas S. Phillips, the church's pastor, and his family.</p>
        <p>"People are surprised when they find that this is a modular home," Mr. Phillips said. "They don't expect big ornamental windows and peak roofs and cedar-shake exteriors on a modular house. The congregation shopped around a lot before they decided to build the house for us, and not only did they find that modular construction gave them the biggest bang for the buck but also that a modular house could be designed exactly for our needs, inside and out.</p>
        <p>"It had to blend with the houses in the neighborhood and with the church, and it had to have an element of flexibility in order to create a lot of good-sized space that we need when we entertain here, which is a lot. It's a great house!"</p>
