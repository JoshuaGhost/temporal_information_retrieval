        <p>THE piggyback tournament has been getting some tryouts in the last five years. The format consists of two overlapping competitions, one a string of elimination minimatches, the other a Swiss-system tournament comprising the players who were knocked out of the first. Each has its own prizes.</p>
        <p>This year's 55th playing of the Hoogoven International Tournament, from Jan. 14 to 31 in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, was a prestigious version of the piggyback format. The former world champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia won the knockout series, and the grandmaster Valery Salov, formerly of Russia and now of Spain, won the Swiss competition.</p>

        <p>THE piggyback tournament has been getting some tryouts in the last five years. The format consists of two overlapping competitions, one a string of elimination minimatches, the other a Swiss-system tournament comprising the players who were knocked out of the first. Each has its own prizes.</p>
        <p>This year's 55th playing of the Hoogoven International Tournament, from Jan. 14 to 31 in Wijk aan Zee, the Netherlands, was a prestigious version of the piggyback format. The former world champion Anatoly Karpov of Russia won the knockout series, and the grandmaster Valery Salov, formerly of Russia and now of Spain, won the Swiss competition.</p>
        <p>Karpov knocked Salov out of the elimination series in the semifinal. Salov was then given a score of 5 1/2-2 1/2 upon his ninth-round entrance into the Swiss-system event. He won 3 1/2 points in the last four rounds and thus finished 9-3, to win it.</p>
        <p>In Round 10, Salov faced the English grandmaster Julian Hodgson, who tried an outre offshoot of the Ruth Attack. But Salov nicely repulsed the effort.</p>
        <p>The Philadelphia master Bill Ruth always retreated his bishop on 2 . . . Ne4. But lately, the peculiar-looking 3 h4!?, which anticipates exploiting the open h file after 3 . . . Ng5 4 hg, has attracted a handful of players.</p>
        <p>Hodgson could have striven for some measure of orthodoxy with either 6 e3 or, after 6 f3 h6, 7 Bf4. Instead, he wanted -- and got -- something messy with 7 fe?! hg 8 Qd3. After 8 . . . e6, 9 Qb5 Nc6 10 Qb7 Nb4! (10 . . . Nd4?! 11 O-O-O would be risky for Black) 11 Qb5 Qd7 12 Qb7 Qc8, Salov took a repetition with 13 Qb5 Qd7 14 Qb7 Qc8 15 Qb5, before calculating that 15 . . . c6 16 Qa4 de would yield him the advantage.</p>
        <p>Hodgson's 17 c4 prevented a retreat with 17 . . . Nd5 and also threatened 18 a3, but after 17 . . . Qa6 18 Qa6 Na6, White had to drop his h pawn. His 25 g3 was part of a plan to block the position, yet after 25 . . . h3 Salov had a protected passed h pawn.</p>
        <p>After 33 . . . Rb8, Hodgson could not well defend by 34 Na2 because 34 . . . Ne8! 35 c5 Bc7 36 Ba6 (36 Re1 Nf6 37 Ba6 Nh5! 38 Rg1 Ng3! 39 Rg3 Rh8 40 Bf1 Bg3 41 Kg3 h2 42 Bg2 Rh3! 43 Kf2 g3 44 Ke2 h1/Q 45 Bh1 Rh1 is hopeless for White) Ba5 is lost for White.</p>
        <p>On 41 . . . Kb6!, there was no use playing 42 d5 e5. Hodgson counted on 42 Na4 Ka6 43 Nc5, but after 43 . . . Kb5 44 Ne6 Kc4, realizing that 45 Ng7 f4! 46 gf Bf4! 47 ef e3 gets Salov a new queen, he gave up. RUTH ATTACK</p>
