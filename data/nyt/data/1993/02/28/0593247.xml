        <p>SQUASHED</p>
        <p>By Joan Bauer. 194 pp. New York: Delacorte Press.</p>
        <p>A LESSER girl might have taken up African violets or giant cabbages. But for 16-year-old Ellie Morgan, the narrator of "Squashed," Joan Bauer's comic first novel, passion is a pumpkin, a very big pumpkin.</p>
        <p>The object of her affection is "intensely mammoth" Max, who is to squashes what Moby-Dick was to marine life. When we meet Max, growing contentedly in Ellie's backyard in small-town Iowa, he weighs 300 pounds and it's only August. Ellie hopes that by fall he will crown her with glory at the Rock River Pumpkin Weigh-In and Harvest Fair, where the grower of the largest pumpkin earns "fame, respect, a dollar a pound and his picture in The Rock River Clarion."</p>
        <p>Ellie has been crazy about pumpkins since she saw the movie "Cinderella" when she was 5 and was captivated by the star of the show, soon to become a magic coach. You "couldn't have done that with a zucchini," she says. Her hometown's motto is "Our pumpkins we prize / Our rights we will maintain." But not everyone in Rock River admires an orange thumb. Ellie's widowed father, a motivational specialist who "has changed a lot of people's lives in the greater Des Moines area," worries that his daughter should be nurturing her self-esteem and not a pumpkin.</p>
        <p>In the end, common-sensical Ellie is able to do both. In her quest to win "the constant battle of the patch," Ellie leaves nothing to chance. Ever vigilant against flood, frost, bugs, fungus, blight, thieves and vandals, Ellie sprays, weeds and composts. She polishes Max with Windex and taps his skin daily in search of rot. She covers him with blankets when it's cold, talks to him, plays music for him and feeds him her secret "booster" of buttermilk and Orange Crush, injected into his stem. At night she gazes tenderly on him from her bedroom window as he gleams orangely in the moonlight. "There is something about a grower's presence that calls a vegetable to greatness," she says.</p>
        <p>Ellie manages to foil pumpkin thieves and unscrupulous competitors, and even acquires a boyfriend along the way. When the great weigh-in arrives, she discovers there's more in the balance than pumpkins.</p>
        <p>"Squashed," which won the Delacorte Press Prize for a first novel for young adults, is not one of those problem-child novels about unwanted pregnancy, drug or alcohol abuse, learning disability, incest, co-dependency or bulimia -- not that those problems don't exist in rural Iowa. This is a funny, fast-paced book about an ordinary girl with an extraordinary ambition. Plump, down-to-earth Ellie is nothing if not responsible -- a capable, reasonably well-adjusted teen-ager with a sense of humor, so-so grades, lots of friends, an extra 20 pounds and a goal. Your average garden-variety heroine. Long may she prosper.</p>
