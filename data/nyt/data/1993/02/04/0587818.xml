        <p>James R. Tallon Jr., the majority leader of the New York State Assembly, has rejected overtures from the Clinton Administration about taking a top job in the Department of Health and Human Services, officials in both Albany and Washington said today.</p>

        <p>James R. Tallon Jr., the majority leader of the New York State Assembly, has rejected overtures from the Clinton Administration about taking a top job in the Department of Health and Human Services, officials in both Albany and Washington said today.</p>
        <p>It appeared increasingly certain, however, that Mary Jo Bane, the state's Social Services Commissioner, will be offered a job as Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services in charge of the Federal welfare bureaucracy. Ms. Bane joined the Cuomo administration only last year after leaving a teaching position at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.</p>
        <p>Donna E. Shalala, President Clinton's Secretary of Health and Human Services, has looked to New York to fill a number of important positions in her bureaucracy. A former president of Hunter College in New York City, Ms. Shalala selected Kevin Thurm, a Manhattan lawyer who ran the Clinton campaign in New York State, as her chief of staff. New Yorkers Considered</p>
        <p>A number of other New Yorkers, including Barbara J. Sabol, the head of New York City's Human Resources Administration, and Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, the city's Health Commissioner, have been rumored to be candidates for jobs in the department.</p>
        <p>At least one other New Yorker, Bruce C. Vladeck, has been interviewed by Clinton Administration officials about the job of administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, the position turned down by Mr. Tallon. Mr. Vladeck is president of the United Hospital Fund of New York, a nonprofit organization that supports hospitals in New York City.</p>
        <p>H.H.S. officials approached Mr. Tallon recently about the job with the financing agency, which oversees Medicare and the Federal portion of the Medicaid program. The agency helps pay for health care services for 67 million people and had total outlays of $230 billion in the last fiscal year.</p>
        <p>While declining to reveal details about his discussions, Mr. Tallon said in an interview today that "commitments in Albany precluded my leaving at this time."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tallon, a 51-year-old Democrat from Binghamton, is nationally recognized as an expert on health-care financing. A former chairman of the Assembly Health Committee, he is expected to play a leading role this year in the Legislature's difficult negotiations over hospital reimbursement rates. Important Policy Role</p>
        <p>Mr. Tallon lost a bid to become Assembly Speaker in December 1991. But the winner of that contest, Saul Weprin, kept Mr. Tallon as majority leader. He has delegated heavy responsibilities to Mr. Tallon both in directing the flow of legislation on the Assembly floor and in formulating health-care policy for the Democratic-majority chamber.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bane has been expected for weeks to be named Assistant Secretary for Children and Families, a position that oversees the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program and a variety of job training programs.</p>
        <p>United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan told an Albany radio station on Tuesday night that President Clinton had told him that Ms. Bane would be "heavily involved in welfare reform." Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said today that Mr. Clinton had asked him about Ms. Bane during a telephone call a few weeks ago.</p>
