        <p>The line of applicants seeking green cards so they may legally work in American households is so long that unless the law is changed, it is virtually pointless to apply, immigration lawyers say.</p>
        <p>Before quotas were tightened in 1991, such cases were routine. But no more. Even when the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Labor Department have formally certified a specific need for a foreigner to do work that no qualified citizen or permanent resident wants, the quotas effectively mean a wait of 15 to 20 years for those who apply now.</p>
        <p>Calls for changes in the law have increased since the nomination of Zoe Baird as Attorney General was derailed because of her family's illegal employment of a Peruvian couple as baby-sitter and driver.</p>
        <p>The possibility of change, no matter how uncertain, may encourage those who have been using undocumented workers (in other words, illegal aliens) as household employees to start the paperwork flowing.</p>
        <p>"I think something needs to change," said Paul Virtue, deputy general counsel for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. "It looks like they were wrong when Congress said that in general there are sufficient workers in the United States to take these jobs."</p>
        <p>Technically, families who start the process in behalf of immigrant workers have given the Immigration and Naturalization Service all the data it would need to fine them for employing illegal aliens. But that almost never happens, because enforcing the law on domestic employers is at the bottom of the service's priorities, Mr. Virtue said. Instead, the service focuses on areas like deporting felons, shutting down industrial sweatshops and fighting fraud.</p>
        <p>"We don't scan through the petitions routinely to try to identify violators," Mr. Virtue said. He estimated that the service fines fewer than 100 people a year for illegally employing household workers; the maximum fine for a first offender is $2,000. The service can also start proceedings to deport the workers. Some cases are reported by informers, a few are high-profile cases like the Bairds, and others are cases randomly selected for investigation.</p>
        <p>In a letter this week to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, the executive director of the American Immigration Lawyers Association called for changes to accommodate people in situations like the Bairds'. The director, Warren R. Leiden, is a member of the Commission on Immigration Reform, which was set up to recommend changes needed in immigration law. Its first report is due in September 1994.</p>
        <p>Robert Remes, an immigration lawyer in Washington, said: "I would say at least start the process. It is not inconceivable that the law might change at some point. Otherwise, these people are condemned to permanent nothingness."</p>
        <p>"But a wait of 15 years is so long as to be almost hopeless," he added. His fee for the whole process is typically $2,700, but he said he could no longer justify his fee when the prospect of eventual success is so distant.</p>
        <p>Workers who can demonstrate a skill, even one as basic as professional cooking or hairdressing, can get green cards in just a few years. And people who have been relying on illegal workers for years might want to help them qualify for new work as skilled employees.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Remes told of a Jamaican who had been waiting four years for a green card. When her sponsors realized that the wait would be at least five more years, they asked her if she had a skill other than baby-sitting. It turned out that she had once worked as a cook for a catering company in Jamaica. A friend of her employers who owns a catering business agreed to sponsor her as a skilled worker, cutting her likely wait to about two years.</p>
        <p>The woman's long wait in domestic service -- especially painful for her because her children are still in Jamaica -- is not unusual. Since 1991, only 10,000 unskilled immigrants a year have been allowed green cards. More than 80,000 people are now in line, according to the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs.</p>
        <p>Some people getting their green cards this month began the application process in late 1987. Because of waits like that, the immigration lawyers' association calls the current provisions of the law "virtually useless." It is calling instead for speeding up the line and allowing child-care workers to work legally but temporarily while waiting for green cards.</p>
        <p>The green card (in fact, it is now rose-colored) confers permanent residency status, the most common way for a foreigner to get the right to work. An applicant and a potential employer, who is the sponsor, must meet several requirements:</p>
        <p>* The first step is to obtain a Labor Department certification that the sponsor is offering the prevailing local wage (which in the case of child-care workers in the District of Columbia is now $7.22 an hour) and that no qualified United States workers are available. This involves filing paperwork and advertising the job. It is common for no legally qualified applicants but many illegal aliens to apply. Depending on the application backlog, which varies by region, the labor certification can take a few months to a couple of years.</p>
        <p>* The next step is to submit a visa petition to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. That petition is often approved in a few months, depending on the regional backlog.</p>
        <p>* Then it is time to obtain an immigrant visa, normally granted at the United States Embassy in the worker's home country. But this is where the long line forms, and there will be quite a wait before the worker can go home and pick up that visa.</p>
        <p>An American consul can give visas only to applicants whose priority date -- that is, the date they first filed application for labor certification -- is before a cutoff date set each month by the State Department. The current cutoff for unskilled workers is Nov. 1, 1987. In recent months, the cutoff date has been moving forward by about one week a month. At this rate, an immigrant who files the initial labor application today probably won't qualify for an immigrant visa for at least 16 years.</p>
        <p>When a visa is issued, the immigrant returns to the United States, surrenders the visa at the point of entry, gets a permanent-residency stamp in his or her passport and is fingerprinted. Finally, the worker gets a permanent green card later in the mail. Formally, it is called an Alien Identification Document.</p>
        <p>Immigration lawyers say the United States should adopt a system like Canada's. After obtaining the labor certification and visa petition, the worker could remain country conditionally for three years. During this time, the immigrant would have to work in the sponsor's home, under conditions and pay established by the Labor Department, and fully comply with tax and Social Security laws. At the end of that period, the worker would qualify to be sponsored for permanent residence under provisions that apply to skilled workers, allowing him or her to get a green card in a reasonable time.</p>
