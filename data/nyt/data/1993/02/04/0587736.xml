        <p>Paul G. Kahn, who founded and ran A.T.&amp; T.'s Universal credit card business, said yesterday that he had resigned to form his own financial services company.</p>
        <p>Since the card's introduction in March 1990, 10.5 million accounts have been signed up.</p>
        <p>"A.T.&amp; T. has stunned the pundits with the most successful credit card in the history of credit cards," said Donald J. Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group in Westbury, L.I. He credits Mr. Kahn, in particular, with having encouraged the American Telephone and Telegraph Company to be unusually aggressive in marketing and spending on customer service.  Split Over Other Products</p>
        <p>Mr. Kahn said he and A.T.&amp; T.'s management had disagreed about whether and how fast to add other financial products to the credit card business.</p>
        <p>He said he was negotiating with potential investors to start a concern that would offer financial services to consumers and might involve credit cards and other products. He declined to be more specific, saying only that he expected the venture to begin in six to nine months.</p>
        <p>"I'm interested in doing another start-up, but doing it for my portfolio this time," he said.</p>
        <p>The A.T.&amp; T card's growth resulted in part from the company's reputation with consumers and offer of a lifetime card with no fee. "No one was making that offer" at the time, Mr. Auriemma said.  Other No-Fee Cards</p>
        <p>Since then, other companies, most notably General Motors, have introduced no-fee cards. The Ford Motor Company and Citibank are expected to introduce one next week. Some people have wondered whether these programs, which offer credits for new-car purchases, will steal business from A.T.&amp; T., but to date, Mr. Kahn said, A.T.&amp; T. has lost only $15 million of its $6 billion in outstanding balances to the G.M. card.</p>
        <p>Some people in the industry question how profitable the program is with no fees, especially since the average account has an outstanding balance of about $600, half the average for banks' programs.</p>
        <p>A.T.&amp; T. has said it expects its card program to have a lower level of profitability than banks' programs.</p>
