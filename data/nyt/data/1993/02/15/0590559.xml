        <p>There is very little in life that professional athletes haven't seen. Many are from the streets and many have fought their way through all kinds of adversity. But there are still some things that have shock value, and apparently one of them is a red-faced, screaming Chuck Daly.</p>
        <p>A halftime tirade in which Daly said the Nets were playing like "Nets losers of the past" pushed the team out of its sleepwalking and past the Heat in overtime, 117-111, before 16,299 at Byrne Meadowlands Arena.</p>
        <p>Miami, winner of only 16 games this season, looked like a world champion for much of the game. Most of the credit for the Heat's performance, however, goes to the Nets, who hardly seemed to be concentrating on the task at hand.</p>
        <p>"I don't know what it was; there's no explanation," said Kenny Anderson, who had 22 points, 10 assists and 8 rebounds. Petrovic to the Rescue</p>
        <p>The Nets were terrible for most of the game. But thanks to some truly heroic efforts by the bench, and behind Drazen Petrovic's team-high 34 points (8 in overtime), New Jersey (29-21) is now 4-0 in overtime; Miami is 0-6.</p>
        <p>"It was obvious to everyone it was a struggling win," said Daly. "We looked tired and sluggish. But I'll take it."</p>
        <p>With Derrick Coleman sitting on the bench for most of the second half because of a bruised right knee (he collided with Miami guard Bimbo Coles) and Chris Morris (4 points) playing as if his mind were in outer space, Daly mix-and-matched his lineup. Rick Mahorn, Chucky Brown and Rumeal Robinson -- each of whom scored 6 points -- got extensive time, but the big contributor off the bench was Bernard King, who had 13 points in 22 minutes.</p>
        <p>But when the Nets' ship was quickly sinking, leave it to Daly to correct its course. The Nets, trailing by 10 at halftime, were treated to a tongue-lashing like they've never heard from Daly before.</p>
        <p>"He went off," said Anderson. "It was a wakeup call."</p>
        <p>"He got the message across," said center Sam Bowie, who had 16 points. "It was the first time I've seen him like that."</p>
        <p>Apparently, in no uncertain terms, Daly questioned the team's professionalism. He was also angry that the Nets were playing so poorly after he had given the team the day off on Saturday. 'Earn Your Paychecks'</p>
        <p>One player described a profanity-laced portion of what Daly said this way: "He was like, 'You guys call yourselves professionals? You don't deserve to make those millions of dollars. I give you the day off and this is how you reward me? You want to go back to being the Nets losers of the past or do you want to win? Earn your paychecks and just play hard. That's all I ask you. Play hard! Stop acting like a bunch of losers!' "</p>
        <p>The Nets responded by going on a 7-0 run to begin the second half.</p>
        <p>After trailing by as many as 12 points, the Nets eventually closed on the Heat. After Harold Miner (who had 24 points off the bench) beat Petrovic one-on-one to tie the score at 101-all, Petrovic came right back. A leaning jumper with 3 seconds left on the shot clock gave New Jersey the lead again, 103-101. Two free throws by Grant Long tied it again, and after Anderson had his jump shot blocked by Coles with 3.8 seconds left, Miami had one last chance to win. But a heave by Miner from behind the 3-point line was long.</p>
        <p>In overtime, Petrovic took over. And the victory was sealed when Brian Shaw, with the Heat trailing, 113-111, missed two free throws with 5.2 seconds left. REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Nets say they are still interested in the troubled Detroit Piston forward DENNIS RODMAN, but fitting him under the salary cap is, among other things, a major obstacle. . . . DRAZEN PETROVIC reiterated his desire to have his contract situation resolved within the next few days. On Wednesday morning, the day after the reserves for the All-Star team were announced and Petrovic wasn't one of them, the Nets made a five-year offer worth about $3.1 million a year. Petrovic wouldn't give details of the offer, but he did say it was a fair one. His only concern is being away from his native Croatia for so long. If he accepted a five-year deal and followed it all the way through, he will have been away from home for a total of 10 years.</p>
