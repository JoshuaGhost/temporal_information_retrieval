        <p>A 40-year-old woman was raped on a sidewalk in midtown Manhattan early yesterday morning as she walked to work, a police spokesman said. A man startled the rapist by jumping out of his red car, shouted for help, and after scaring the rapist, sped away, said Lieut. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. The woman was walking east on 51st Street between Madison and Park Avenues about 6 A.M. when she was approached from behind by the attacker, Lieutenant O'Donnell said.</p>
