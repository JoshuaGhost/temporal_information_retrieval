      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>" 'Twentysomething,' and Home Again on L.I."  [ Jan. 31 ] , on the adjustment involved when a college graduate returns to live in his or her childhood home, focuses on one trend affecting the "twentysomething" generation. But you ignore another equally as important trend, parent subsidization of children's postcollege life style. Growing numbers of college graduates are becoming part of a new "subsidized generation," in which financially able parents cheerfully underwrite apartments in the city so that both their children and they themselves may continue to enjoy their independence. The trend is furthered by the possibility, in some cases, of declaring a portion of the apartment a city "office" and of realizing tax advantages. GEORGE HABER Jericho</p>
