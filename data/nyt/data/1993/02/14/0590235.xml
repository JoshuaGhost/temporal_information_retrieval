        <p>The planned large-scale withdrawal of American troops from Somalia, expected to begin next month, is drawing concern from relief workers, who fear a rapid transfer to United Nations leadership will undermine the stability the United-States led operation has created so far.</p>
        <p>In addition, the United Nations force, which will be headed by Turkish Lieut. Gen. Cevit Bir, will have less than half the troops the American-led force had, but will face the additional responsibility of extending the foreign military presence into northern Somalia, where disarmament is likely to prove trickier.</p>
        <p>"The intervention of United States forces has brought a veneer of stability to Somalia, but the country still needs a lot of propping up," said Cynthia Osterman, a spokeswoman for the relief agency CARE.</p>
        <p>"There's still the potential for a lot of chaos."</p>
        <p>While United States officials here had initially stressed the gradual nature of any transfer, with parallel command structures easing a shift they said would be almost imperceptible the expected transfer is expected to be more abrupt. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is expected to deliver a one-month timetable for departure this week.</p>
        <p>At its height, the coalition led 38,300 troops. The proposed United Nations force would number 15,000 to 20,000, including 5,000 troops from the United States for logistical support and an offshore rapid reaction force of 2,000.</p>
        <p>A team of three European Community police officials who visited northern Somalia this week described terrain laden with land mines and scenes of rampant lawlessness to match those of southern Somalia before the arrival of foreign troops.</p>
        <p>Relief workers said bandits and looters were likely to test the limits of any new security arrangements, and appeared to brace themselves for a new bout of robberies and assaults.</p>
        <p>"If they're going to reduce their numbers by half, that means that we're going to have to rely more on our own security," said Norman Sheehan, acting field director for the Irish charity Goal. Before the arrival of United States troops, Goal's workers would carry a heavy machine gun and two AK-47s in their cars, he said. Now, they carry only the AK-47s.</p>
        <p>"Nobody will be moving about as freely as we do now," he said. "We used to have to have armed guards just to cross the road, and we'll probably have to do that again."</p>
