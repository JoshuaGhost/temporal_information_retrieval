        <p>IN a quick, early victory for its Middle East diplomacy, the Clinton Administration squelched the squabbling at the United Nations last week over Israel's deportation of 400 Palestinians from the fundamentalist Hamas group and nudged the Palestine Liberation Organization toward resuming peace talks with Israel.</p>
        <p>The Security Council welcomed Israel's decision to take back 101 Palestinians as "a step in the right direction." But it said it wants the others taken back soon, as it had ordered. Israel will do so by year's end, maybe sooner.</p>

        <p>IN a quick, early victory for its Middle East diplomacy, the Clinton Administration squelched the squabbling at the United Nations last week over Israel's deportation of 400 Palestinians from the fundamentalist Hamas group and nudged the Palestine Liberation Organization toward resuming peace talks with Israel.</p>
        <p>The Security Council welcomed Israel's decision to take back 101 Palestinians as "a step in the right direction." But it said it wants the others taken back soon, as it had ordered. Israel will do so by year's end, maybe sooner.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Council told the P.L.O. it is turning a deaf ear to further pleas for sanctions against Israel or even a publicity-generating debate at which it could air its grievances.</p>
        <p>The agreement cleared the way for Secretary of State Warren M. Christopher to breathe new life into the peace process when he visits the Middle East this week. Privately, senior Israelis say the P.L.O. will rejoin the talks soon. The air at the United Nations was heavy with the scent of secret deals.</p>
        <p>The agreement also showed that the Arab world's top priority is a Middle East peace settlement, not posturing against Israel. Morocco brokered the deal with the help of the non-Arab states of Pakistan and Djibouti, the Security Council's two other Muslim members. Third world support for another scrap with Israel proved nonexistent. This suggested that most Muslim governments now see the enemy as fundamentalism, not Israel. And they know that getting into a fight with the United States only strengthens the fundamentalists' claim that moderation is doomed to fail.</p>
