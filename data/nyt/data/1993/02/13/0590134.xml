        <p>Over the last seven years, during one of the worst economic periods in modern times, few cities in America added jobs as quickly as Seattle did. This Pacific Rim port has been held up as the city of the future: an economy free of smokestack industries, producing things the world wants to buy, from airplanes and computer software to biotechnology and exotic coffee.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 26, a day some here are calling "Black Tuesday," the city of the future was told it might lose 50,000 jobs in the next 18 months -- nearly 5 percent of the area's work force. The Boeing Company, this city's old partner in civic destiny, said hard times in the world airline industry were forcing it to cut production by 35 percent.</p>

        <p>Over the last seven years, during one of the worst economic periods in modern times, few cities in America added jobs as quickly as Seattle did. This Pacific Rim port has been held up as the city of the future: an economy free of smokestack industries, producing things the world wants to buy, from airplanes and computer software to biotechnology and exotic coffee.</p>
        <p>On Jan. 26, a day some here are calling "Black Tuesday," the city of the future was told it might lose 50,000 jobs in the next 18 months -- nearly 5 percent of the area's work force. The Boeing Company, this city's old partner in civic destiny, said hard times in the world airline industry were forcing it to cut production by 35 percent.</p>
        <p>The move is very likely to result in up to 20,000 layoffs at Boeing plants in the Puget Sound area and tens of thousands more at businesses here that depend on the Boeing payroll. Boeing is also laying off 5,000 or so workers at plants in Wichita, Kan.</p>
        <p>When Pittsburgh lost its steel mills, or Flint, Mich., lost its auto plants, the cities were said to be rust belt relics clinging to dinosaur industries. Seattle's story is different, making it all the more troubling to business and Government leaders trying to build the nation's manufacturing base. Clinton Pledges Help</p>
        <p>For one thing, Boeing is no dinosaur. Even with its recent contraction, it is the nation's leading exporter, building nearly 60 percent of the world's airplanes. Last year its profits were $1.6 billion. It has orders stretching to the 21st century. The jobs are high paying and mostly high technology.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, responding to a question from a Boeing worker at his televised "town meeting," President Clinton said the Government intended to take forceful measures to keep Boeing and the rest of the aerospace industry healthy.</p>
        <p>"I am not going to roll over and play dead," Mr. Clinton said. "Seven technologies are going to shape the high-wage jobs of the future. And one of the biggest is commercial aviation. The United States has a lead there. We are losing it because we have not fought to maintain it."</p>
        <p>But while political leaders may be able to shore up the domestic air industry, those measures are not likely to help the world economy. And Boeing, more than virtually any other major American company, has hitched its fortunes to world commerce.  Dangers of Dependency</p>
        <p>Seattle coasted above the last major recession in large part because it had an economy based on world trade. What the layoff announcements have demonstrated to many business leaders here is that no city, no matter how forward-looking and global its economic base, should be so dependent on a single company.</p>
        <p>"When everybody else was singing its praises, I thought the Seattle economy was a train wreck waiting to happen because it was so dependent on Boeing," said Joel Kotkin, a Los Angeles writer who specializes in Pacific Rim trends and is a senior fellow at the Center for the New West in Denver.</p>
        <p>From 1984 to 1990, Boeing doubled its Seattle-area payroll to a high of 106,000. In those years, the Puget Sound region added more than 300,000 jobs, growing at three times the national average. At one point, Boeing was hiring 500 people a week. Now the company employs 98,000 people in the metropolitan area, which has a population of 2 million.</p>
        <p>Mike Wills moved to Seattle in 1987, bought a house, then began a family with his wife. He was hired by Boeing two years ago but was notified last month that he would soon be laid off. "I chose Seattle over other cities because it seemed like there would be more opportunity," he said. "I'm optimistic I'll land on my feet. But the short-term fear from something like this puts a lot of stress on the family." The Envy of Other Cities</p>
        <p>The recent Boeing boom may have produced a false sense of security, what Glenn Pascall, a local economist and writer, called "an absolute sense of superiority because of the dominance of Boeing."</p>
        <p>"Seattle is what every city is trying to become," said Mr. Pascall. "It is already a high-tech center, competing globally. But then something like these massive layoffs come along and it makes you wonder."</p>
        <p>Perhaps no major city in the nation is more attached to a single employer. Even General Motors employs far fewer people in the Detroit area, about 50,000, than Boeing does in Seattle.</p>
        <p>"People who've been in Seattle long enough are really afraid of Boeing, because they've been hammered before by these busts," said Charles Royer, the former Mayor, now director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University. "It's like San Franciscans who have been through an earthquake. You walk around on eggshells, even during the good times."</p>
        <p>The city has shaken some of its dependence on the aerospace giant. In 1970, after a collapse of major orders for new planes, the company shed 64,000 jobs, two-thirds of the payroll, and the famous sign appeared: "Will the last person leaving Seattle please turn out the lights?" Unemployment reached 13 percent, the highest of any city in the nation. Buoyed by Microsoft</p>
        <p>Virtually no one is predicting such a gloomy scene this time around. Twenty years ago, 1 in 5 jobs in the Seattle area was at Boeing. Today the figure is 1 in 10, and the region supports more than 200,000 high-tech jobs, many at Microsoft, where the average salary is $81,000 a year. It is also a national leader in biotechnology, fisheries and container-ship port activity.</p>
        <p>Dick Conway, who makes the economic forecasts for several Seattle-area government agencies, says the city may still escape a recession, even with the loss of 50,000 jobs. Boeing, he said, is the only drag on an otherwise healthy economy.</p>
        <p>"The reason we've done better than most states is because through Boeing and others, we are more dependent on world trade than any other state," Mr. Conway said. "Over the long run, I'd say if you have to be dependent on someone, you couldn't pick a better company to be dependent on than Boeing."</p>
        <p>Still, the drag is a big one. Because Boeing workers are paid so much more than they were 20 years ago and are far more productive, the layoffs will affect virtually every part of the region's economy, he said.  Both Loved and Loathed</p>
        <p>There is talk in Washington, D.C., about providing some sort of legislative relief for Boeing and the airlines. One proposal, backed by Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, would change bankruptcy laws so that airlines operating under such restrictions could not start fare wars, thereby dragging down the healthy carriers. Over the last three years the nation's airlines have lost more than $9 billion, which is more than they made in profit in the previous 44 years.</p>
        <p>Seattle residents have long been ambivalent about Boeing. "Most of us regard Boeing the way Indians once thought of Mount Rainier -- a cloudy, mysterious place about which nothing much can be known," David Brewster, editor of The Seattle Weekly, a newspaper focusing on the news and the arts, wrote in a recent column.</p>
        <p>Paul Schell, dean of the School of Architecture at the University of Washington and a Seattle Port commissioner, calls Boeing the "company people love to hate."</p>
        <p>"If there's a good side to these layoffs, it is that this will stir us out of a complacency that comes from having a Boeing in your backyard," he said.</p>
