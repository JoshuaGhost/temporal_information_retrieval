        <p>When asked about Janet Reno, friends and critics alike in the Miami legal community respond first with the word "integrity." For a nominee to high office, that's a good beginning.</p>
        <p>It may also mark the beginning of the end of President Clinton's snakebitten search for his attorney general. This is the welcome first impression of Ms. Reno, State Attorney for Dade County, Florida, who heads the vast law office that fights street crime in sprawling, diverse Miami.</p>
        <p>With an air of quiet confidence Ms. Reno promises "to establish integrity, excellence and professionalism as the hallmarks" of the Justice Department. She says she'll be tough on criminals, supportive of abused children and other crime victims, a leader against discrimination, a protector of the environment without hostility toward business.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno has the manner of a law enforcer who feels no need to act tough. Her office has won some cases and lost some during her sometimes turbulent 15-year tenure. And she seems to have learned from the losses. After the acquittal in 1980 of four police officers accused of murdering a black man led to riots in Miami, she earned the support of the black community by opening her office to minorities and making herself accessible to citizen complaints.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, much examination of Ms. Reno lies ahead. She has successfully sought the death penalty, yet says she would vote against capital punishment if she were a legislator. Will she then endorse the proliferation of death laws at the Federal level or can she resist Congressional demagoguery on the subject? The Senate Judiciary Committee, which has its share of demagogues, must inquire.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno will seek sentences for hardened criminals "that put them away and keep them away," but will try to save nonviolent offenders. Will she work to provide adequate legal counsel and fair court hearings on violations of constitutional rights? Can she guide Congress to help local police forces with more cops and stronger gun restrictions that disarm hoodlums and urban terrorists?</p>
        <p>Sometimes criticized for bucking big cases to Federal enforcers, Ms. Reno replies that she's more interested in winning those cases than bagging the credit. Can her own indifference to turf wars help her settle the looming battles over drug enforcement territory, to say nothing of control over the strife-torn F.B.I.?</p>
        <p>Does the nominee have the intellectual capacity to direct national legal strategy? Can she deploy top lawyers in the Supreme Court? Does she know the qualities needed by those who would sit on the highest court?</p>
        <p>While the Senate and the public start searching for clues, Janet Reno's strong record, public poise and, above all, her widely acknowledged integrity, suggest she can succeed at a very challenging job.</p>
