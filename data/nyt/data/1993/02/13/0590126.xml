        <p>Tucked into Mayor David Dinkins's latest New York City budget plan is a a proposed experiment that, in time, could have a substantial effect on both municipal budgets and public safety. The experiment bears watching locally and across America.</p>
        <p>The idea is for the city's Probation Department to apply modern technology and better management to the task, now poorly carried out, of supervising thousands of criminals not sent to prison but released under court supervision.</p>
        <p>The probation departments responsible for such supervision typically run the largest correctional programs in a city or county. The active caseload in New York City totals 45,000, more than twice the number in city jails. Yet because legislators and municipal leaders rarely pay much attention to probation needs, crushing caseloads and paperwork severely hamper supervision.</p>
        <p>New York City's new Probation Commissioner, Michael Jacobson, believes that a restructuring plan could improve the effectiveness of probation supervision while saving money. He would separate out two groups from the general caseload: those with deeply troubled or violent backgrounds who require intensive monitoring and help, and those more stable cases needing far less attention.</p>
        <p>To deal with the easier cases, he would equip probation offices with kiosks similar to bank automatic teller machines. Instead of reporting for interviews with a probation officer to answer questions on employment status, living arrangements and the like, the client would check in with the machine and punch in answers to such questions.</p>
        <p>Technology now makes possible positive identification electronically through laser reading of fingerprints or other means. On request, the machine could supply information about social services, just as probation officers do now. Ideally, the machines could vastly reduce paperwork and face-to-face interviews for easier cases, allowing officers to focus on the hard ones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobson would require officers meeting with the more troubled clients to do so in small groups, rather than one on one. Group meetings would permit more frequent contact. Because a single officer would deal with more clients, the convict who now reports twice a month for 20 minutes could be required to show up for a two-hour meeting every week. And the group approach might have a more positive impact on the clients' attitudes than individual interviews.</p>
        <p>Of greatest immediate interest to City Hall is Mr. Jacobson's belief that automation would allow for smaller staffs. Even after granting officers $1 million in "gainsharing" bonuses, the city could net savings of $2 million per year.</p>
        <p>There's room for skepticism. The automated kiosks are untested for such use, and the idea of any staff shrinkage makes some criminal justice experts nervous, whatever the productivity gains.</p>
        <p>But the combination of high tech and group case management -- potentially adaptable for other agencies with big client caseloads -- remains intriguing enough to justify a pilot program. Once it starts, the experiment merits close attention, and not just in New York.</p>
