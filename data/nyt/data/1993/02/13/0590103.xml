        <p>The lights went out in the Palestra tonight, and for Columbia that was a sure sign the game was over, even though there were 9 minutes 28 seconds to play. By the time one of the 6,898 fans in attendance for this showdown between the Ivy League's top two teams accidentally hit a switch, causing a row of lights to black out and force a five-minute delay in the game, the University of Pennsylvania was leading Columbia, 63-35, on the way to an 84-63 victory.</p>
        <p>"We were in trouble from the tip," said Buck Jenkins, who led the Lions with 19 points. "We didn't come out of the starting blocks and they did. Then they finished us the way they were supposed to."</p>

        <p>The lights went out in the Palestra tonight, and for Columbia that was a sure sign the game was over, even though there were 9 minutes 28 seconds to play. By the time one of the 6,898 fans in attendance for this showdown between the Ivy League's top two teams accidentally hit a switch, causing a row of lights to black out and force a five-minute delay in the game, the University of Pennsylvania was leading Columbia, 63-35, on the way to an 84-63 victory.</p>
        <p>"We were in trouble from the tip," said Buck Jenkins, who led the Lions with 19 points. "We didn't come out of the starting blocks and they did. Then they finished us the way they were supposed to."</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania, 14-4 over all and undefeated in six league games, used the proven formula of solid shooting (58.6 percent), great defense (13 Columbia turnovers) and control of the backboards (35 to 25).</p>
        <p>The final score didn't even tell the whole story. What did was the fact Penn finished the game with three players who had played in a junior varsity game two hours earlier.</p>
        <p>Barry Pierce, one of five Penn players in double figures (12 points), admitted the Quakers had a mission tonight. Columbia (11-8, 5-2) came into the Palestra in second place and had hopes of moving into a first-place tie.</p>
        <p>"We wanted to send Columbia the same message that we want to send the next eight games . . . that we're the best team in the league," Pierce said.</p>
        <p>Penn dominated from beginning, taking a 42-24 lead at halftime. Penn made 17 of 29 shots, outrebounded Columbia 16-8 and scored 16 points off nine Columbia turnovers in the first half. The Quakers jumped to a 12-2 lead in the first six minutes, stretched it to 21-11 and never let Columbia get closer than 7 points (26-19).</p>
        <p>"We were patient on offense and played as well as we possibly can in that first half," said Pennsylvania Coach Fran Dunphy.</p>
        <p>Penn's sophomore guard Jerome Allen led the way with 16 points and 7 assists. Tim Krug added 11 points off the bench, and Shawn Trice and Eric Moore scored 10 points each.</p>
