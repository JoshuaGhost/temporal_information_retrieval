        <p>When you're hot, you're hot, and Patrick Ewing has been hot. Yesterday, Ewing was named to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the sixth consecutive year, and for the seventh time in his eight-year National Basketball Association career.</p>
        <p>That announcement came after Monday night's performance in Philadelphia, in which Ewing continued his recent dominance with a season-high 40 points, helping the Knicks to their fifth consecutive victory.</p>

        <p>When you're hot, you're hot, and Patrick Ewing has been hot. Yesterday, Ewing was named to the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the sixth consecutive year, and for the seventh time in his eight-year National Basketball Association career.</p>
        <p>That announcement came after Monday night's performance in Philadelphia, in which Ewing continued his recent dominance with a season-high 40 points, helping the Knicks to their fifth consecutive victory.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' center was one of seven players selected as an All-Star reserve by the Eastern Conference coaches for the Feb. 21 game in Salt Lake City. Joining Ewing as Eastern reserves will be three Cleveland Cavaliers -- center Brad Daugherty, forward Larry Nance and guard Mark Price, along with guard Joe Dumars of the Detroit Pistons, forward Detlef Schrempf of the Indiana Pacers and forward Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks. Riley to Be the Coach</p>
        <p>Ewing will be joined at the game by Coach Pat Riley of the Knicks, who will coach the East squad because the Knicks (30-15) have the second-best record in the conference. Phil Jackson, coach of the Chicago Bulls (32-15), is ineligible because he was an All-Star coach last season. It will be Riley's ninth All-Star appearance, having coached the Western Conference eight times when he was with the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
        <p>Ewing had started the last three All-Star games, but Shaquille O'Neal, the Orlando Magic's rookie sensation, had over 200,000 more votes among fans than did Ewing. Asked about O'Neal's starting at center as a rookie instead of him, Ewing said: "Shaq's having a great year. I'm just happy to have been selected."</p>
        <p>Ewing's strong play has been a major reason why the Knicks have won nine of their last 10 games and have built a four-game lead over the Nets in the Atlantic Division. In his last 10 games Ewing has averaged 27.6 points, and for the season he has averaged 23 points and 12.3 rebounds while shooting 48.8 percent from the field. Twice this season, Ewing has been named the league's Player of the Week.</p>
        <p>The Western Conference reserves, selected by the coaches, will be forward Sean Elliott of the San Antonio Spurs, guard Tim Hardaway of the Golden State Warriors, forward Shawn Kemp of the Seattle Supersonics, forward Dan Majerle of the Phoenix Suns, forward Danny Manning of the Los Angeles Clippers, center Hakeem Olajuwon of the Houston Rockets and guard Mitch Richmond of the Sacramento Kings. Forward Chris Mullin of Golden State was also named to the team, but he is recovering from an injured thumb and will not play. Paul Westphal, Phoenix's first-year coach, will coach the West. Starters Are Chosen by the Fans</p>
        <p>The starters for both conferences were voted on by the fans. Starting for the West will be forwards Charles Barkley (Phoenix) and Karl Malone (Utah Jazz), center David Robinson (San Antonio) and guards Clyde Drexler (Portland Trail Blazers) and John Stockton (Utah). Starting for the East will be forwards Larry Johnson (Charlotte Hornets) and Scottie Pippen (Chicago Bulls), guards Michael Jordan (Chicago) and Isiah Thomas (Detroit), and O'Neal at center.</p>
        <p>As always, some outstanding players were not selected to the team. The Nets had three players they thought were deserving: Kenny Anderson, Derrick Coleman and Drazen Petrovic. Jeff Hornacek of the Philadelphia 76ers is averaging 20.3 points and 7 assists, and he was a Western Conference All-Star last season. Also missing from the Salt Lake City roster was Reggie Lewis, an All-Star last season and the Boston Celtics' leading scorer (20.9 points per game). REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Knicks did not practice yesterday and they are idle until tomorrow night when they play host to Houston. . . . CHARLES SMITH, still bothered by the flu, played just five minutes on Monday in the Knicks' 120-115 overtime victory in Philadelphia. "Charles was very weak," said Coach PAT RILEY of the Knicks. "He rested all day, but he was drained, you could see it. Maybe a couple of days rest will get him back to normal."  BASKETBALL</p>
