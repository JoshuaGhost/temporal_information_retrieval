        <p>Bowing to protests from retirees, the Clinton Administration has decided against freezing cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients as a way of lowering the Federal budget deficit, a White House spokesman said.</p>

        <p>Bowing to protests from retirees, the Clinton Administration has decided against freezing cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients as a way of lowering the Federal budget deficit, a White House spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's decision went against the advice of his budget director, Leon E. Panetta, who had advocated a one-year freeze on the adjustments. The President had been warned by members of Congress that such an idea would go nowhere.</p>
        <p>But the White House has still not ruled out increasing the taxes on Social Security benefits. Some Administration officials have suggested that this proposal would be more acceptable to the 30 million people who now receive monthly Social Security benefits, since it affects only those recipients who also receive substantial income from other sources. 'Special Contract' With Elderly</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has come under intense political heat over Social Security cuts since the White House floated the notion on Capitol Hill last month. Trying to mend fences at a White House meeting on Friday night, Mr. Clinton reassured leaders of the American Association of Retired Persons, an influential lobbying group, that he considered Social Security to be a special contract with the nation's elderly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told the A.A.R.P. officials that he was also considering a plan to include the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare.</p>
        <p>Asked today if Mr. Clinton was still considering a freeze on cost-of-living increases, George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said, "I think it's very unlikely it's something the President wants to do."  'Cut Government First'</p>
        <p>Mr. Stephanopoulos said curbing Social Security cost-of-living adjustments would hurt low-income people disproportionately and conflict with the principles Mr. Clinton is using to define his economic choices.</p>
        <p>"The principles are, cut Government first, get the most from those who made the most, achieve both investment and deficit reduction and be fair," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.</p>
        <p>In October, the Government announced that Social Security benefits would increase by 3 percent to keep pace with inflation starting with checks in January 1993. The increase meant the average Social Security recipient's check rose to $653 from $634.</p>
        <p>A one-year freeze in cost-of-living increases next year would save as much as $15 billion in 1997, or about 10 percent of the total deficit reduction the Administration is seeking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stephanopoulos did not say whether Mr. Clinton might still propose an increase in the taxes on Social Security benefits. Under current law, retired couples with annual adjusted gross incomes above $32,000 and individual retirees with adjusted gross incomes above $25,000 must pay income taxes on half of their Social Security benefits. The Congressional Budget Office and others have suggested that one possible way of raising more money would be to make 85 percent of such income taxable. Other Economic Issues</p>
        <p>As Mr. Clinton continued to lay the groundwork for the economic speech he will deliver to a joint session of Congress on Feb. 17, he has wrestled with a number of related issues that he hopes will allow him to set the stage for the bitter medicine he is expected to recommend.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he will announce his plans to meet a campaign promise to cut the White House staff by 25 percent, and on Wednesday will announce a plan to cut administrative costs by 3 percent across the board, White House officials said.</p>
        <p>But the President's announcement of staff or spending reductions in the White House will not be as sharp as Mr. Clinton promised during the campaign, and will not take effect until next fall, White House aides said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Clinton Administration plans to keep the White House staffed at Bush Administration levels, and is almost certain to request additional financing from Congress.</p>
        <p>As recently as Jan. 12, Mr. Clinton told voters he would "present to the United States Congress a plan to cut the White House staff by 25 percent."</p>
        <p>The announcement Tuesday will not precisely keep that promise, according to White House officials.</p>
        <p>"We're biting the bullet on staff, with cuts virtually across the board," said one White House official. "But the final figure is going to be in the mid to high teens, not 25 percent." He added, however, that Mr. Clinton would announce a cut in overall White House spending, achieved through reductions in salaries and privileges, that "would be in the mid-20's."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said today that he had largely made up his mind about the elements of the economic package, which is expected to include tax increases for upper income individuals and consumers.</p>
        <p>"I have made the decision on the general outline of the stimulus program, and I have made a lot of the specific decisions within it, but we're going to go back over it all one more time to refine it," Mr. Clinton said in a brief question-and-answer session at the White House.</p>
        <p>For two days running, Mr. Clinton has been meeting with the members of National Economic Council to discuss spending and tax options. And he has been consulting with political advisers from his campaign, including Paul Begala, James Carville and Stanley Greenberg, on the best way to sell the plan he will present Feb. 17.</p>
        <p>Today, the President announced plans to ask Congress to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 26 weeks beyond the 26 weeks now provided that end March 6.</p>
        <p>"The old ways of doing business are simply not good enough anymore," Mr. Clinton said. "Unemployment compensation must now be both a short-term lifeline for workers and a long-term link to the skills that it will take for them to get where they want to be, back in the work force."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also announced today that he would abolish the Council on Environmental Quality and replace it with a new White House Office of Environmental Policy. That office, which would be about one-third of the size of the current council, will be headed by Kathleen McGinty, an aide to Vice President Gore who would assume the title deputy assistant to the President.</p>
