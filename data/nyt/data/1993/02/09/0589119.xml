        <p>To the penurious, apartment-bound New Yorker in February, Arcadia might be a country house in Westchester that someone else takes care of, or perhaps a Vermont snowbank to be looked at, not shoveled through. To Theocritus and Virgil, it was a place in Greece: rugged mountains surrounding mossy clearings and deep forests, where shepherds sang and made love but by all appearances never worked. For Marie Antoinette (before revolutionists decided to shorten her a little) Arcadia was a rural cottage a la mode, with milkmaids all in silk.</p>
        <p>For two nights and a day on Friday and Saturday, Nicholas McGegan, four other musicians, two singers, two speakers and three lecturers told audiences at the Metropolitan Museum about another set of artistic daydreamers. Their patron was an expatriate Swedish Queen, and the organization -- founded in Rome in 1690 and consisting of musicians, poets, artists and thinkers -- called itself the Arcadian Academy. This is also the name of Mr. McGegan's five-person instrumental group.</p>

        <p>To the penurious, apartment-bound New Yorker in February, Arcadia might be a country house in Westchester that someone else takes care of, or perhaps a Vermont snowbank to be looked at, not shoveled through. To Theocritus and Virgil, it was a place in Greece: rugged mountains surrounding mossy clearings and deep forests, where shepherds sang and made love but by all appearances never worked. For Marie Antoinette (before revolutionists decided to shorten her a little) Arcadia was a rural cottage a la mode, with milkmaids all in silk.</p>
        <p>For two nights and a day on Friday and Saturday, Nicholas McGegan, four other musicians, two singers, two speakers and three lecturers told audiences at the Metropolitan Museum about another set of artistic daydreamers. Their patron was an expatriate Swedish Queen, and the organization -- founded in Rome in 1690 and consisting of musicians, poets, artists and thinkers -- called itself the Arcadian Academy. This is also the name of Mr. McGegan's five-person instrumental group.</p>
        <p>Friday's concert alternated the spoken and the sung. Using the turn of the 18th century as a kind of hub, it reached back musically as far as the late 16th century (Guarini and Morley) and as far forward as the late Baroque (Vivaldi and Thomas Arne). Elizabeth Hubbard and John Kuether read Shakespeare, Marlowe, Goldsmith and Virgil himself. Mr. Kuether, a baritone, and Dana Hanchard, a soprano, sang.</p>
        <p>Talks on Saturday afternoon -- Ellen T. Smith on music, David R. Coffin on landscape and architecture and Olivier Bernier on painting -- clarified the tone and mood of what Mr. McGegan calls "the pastoral escape." Not quite a never-never land, Arcadia is instead that once-was-but-never-will-be-again kind of place. In music, rolling pulses of three beats, often 6/8 time, were its signature. Such pastoral interludes became what was termed "oases" set in the middle of operatic high drama. Handel introduced them into "Messiah," once with a "symphony" and again in the aria "He shall feed his flock."</p>
        <p>Mingled with Arcadia's simple allures -- its leisure, abundance and pursuit of sensuality -- was a sense of loss, a melancholy over virgin landscapes and uncomplicated pleasures that had existed in the past but were now out of reach. Cantatas sung by Ms. Hanchard on Saturday night offered two reactions to love lost: Alessandro Scarlatti's "Bella Madre dei Fiori" with its lugubrious moans of regret and Handel's "Tu Fedel? Tu Costante?" full of sharp sarcasms.</p>
        <p>Arcadia and the genre of pastoral opera that advertised its wares were much mocked in its time. Swift, Pope and Gay advocated applying their principles to the lowlife of Newgate Prison. The result was "The Beggar'sOpera."</p>
        <p>Like Alessandro Scarlatti, Corelli was a member of the Roman Arcadians, and some of his best-known music was written for their concerts. Led by two splendid violinists, Elizabeth Blumenstock and Katherine Kyme, Mr. McGegan's own Arcadian Academy played Corelli Sonatas in B flat and G. Both took the form of agreeable conversation, with small ideas offered by one instrument and then affirmatively echoed by the second. Salamone Rossi's "Sonata in Dialogo detta la Viena" also featured short phrases in peaceful imitation; in Marco Uccellini's "Sonata nona a doi violini" the dialogue became heated, almost antagonistic.</p>
        <p>As a foreigner, Handel could not join the original Arcadian Academy, but he wrote music for it. If the E-major Trio Sonata on Saturday is an example, his contributions were of a weightier and more earthbound kind. Mr. McGegan, who presided from the harpsichord all evening, also played a Domenico Scarlatti solo sonata (D major, No. 490) emphasizing the brazen minor-key dissonances but also devising from it a kind of comic-satiric monologue, one that was probably more of his invention than of the composer's.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGegan's other players in this excellent group were David Bowles, cellist, and David Tayler, lutenist. Ms. Hanchard sang with a slight voice and not very good diction, but so deep was her private involvement in the material before her that her sighs and scowls, both musical and facial, became endearing substitutes for the words listeners had such a hard time hearing.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 11, 1993, Thursday</p>
        <p>A music review on Tuesday about a presentation by the Arcadian Academy at the Metropolitan Museum misidentified the lecturer on music. She is Ellen T. Harris, not Ellen T. Smith.</p>
