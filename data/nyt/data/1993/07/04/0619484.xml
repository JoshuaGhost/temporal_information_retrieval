        <p>IT was one of the busiest days of the year at one of the busiest national parks in the country, but the sign at our planned campground declared: Closed. Because of budget cuts, rangers explained, the camp is not open this year.</p>
        <p>We had hoped to establish a comfortable base at the Mathews Arm Campground in Shenandoah National Park, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, for a Memorial Day weekend of hiking. Instead, with every open campground in the park full, we had to park at the edge of the park's spectacular Skyline Drive and haul our gear deeper than we had planned into the woods to strike a camp.</p>
        <p>This was hardly a major inconvenience, but under park rules our back-country bivouac could have no campfire, and our distance from the car made it a bit harder to reach the trails we had picked for our daily excursions along the Appalachian Trail and its many tributaries.</p>
        <p>On the trails, we encountered maintenance workers still clearing away trees that had fallen under the weight of ice that had long since melted, and at the Dickey Ridge Visitor Center at the park's northern end there were none of the usual offerings of ranger-led educational programs.</p>
        <p>The campground closings, maintenance backlogs and cuts in the highly instructive interpretive programs that we found are symptomatic of a budget squeeze that is hitting the National Park Service hard from coast to coast this year.</p>
        <p>The Wilderness Society, after conducting an extensive survey of conditions in many parks, issued a survey in May that reported: "A record number of people are expected to visit the national park system, and while they can look forward to rewarding experiences, they may come back home troubled by what they have seen."</p>
        <p>The parks budget was tight to begin with, and has recently become even tighter, say officials of the National Park Service. The defeat in Congress of President Clinton's economic stimulus program cut off an anticipated increase in financing -- and cost many seasonal employees their summer jobs. Bad weather this spring reduced the park coffers further, as did a few unusually expensive rescue efforts.</p>
        <p>The net effect is that parks around the country are cutting back on their offerings, and visitors -- whose numbers grew to 273 million in 1992, an increase of 6 million over 1991 -- must pay special attention to planning throughout the summer. That will become even more important in the autumn, because after Labor Day there will be further cutbacks at many parks.</p>
        <p>"We ain't getting better," said Duncan Morrow, a spokesman in Washington for the park service.</p>
        <p>The Wilderness Society, in its survey of major parks, found dozens of campgrounds closed all summer, visitor center hours cut back, fewer rangers on patrol to protect and assist visitors, fewer lifeguards, fewer guided nature walks, less maintenance of trails, buildings and vehicles, and, in many parks, cuts in scientific research.</p>
        <p>At the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, for example, there will be only 150 guided programs a week instead of the usual 250, the Wilderness Society found. At the Canadian border of Glacier National Park in Montana, tours have been eliminated and racks of brochures are offered instead. At Olympic National Park in Washington, where 7 percent of the budget goes to interpretive programs, an amphitheater program that used to draw 120 people nightly will be offered only on weekends.</p>
        <p>The National Park Service said at the start of the year that its budget was $34 million short of the $986 million needed to maintain last year's level of service. President Clinton's economic stimulus program would have added $253 million to the budget this year, but it was defeated. Many parks raised their entry and camping fees early this year, usually by a dollar or two, but steeper increases that were sought by the parks have not been approved by Congress.</p>
        <p>And at about 50 parks, shortages of rangers have resulted in entrance stations' being unstaffed for part of the day, meaning that many visitors enter without paying, further decreasing park income. Park managers say that can't be helped, since rangers cannot be diverted from safety duties.</p>
        <p>On top of the budget woes came bad weather. Spring storms cost the park system $6 million; at Shenandoah, it cost $250,000 just to clear the downed trees from Skyline Drive, the winding road that runs along the ridge line, its views of the famous Shenandoah Valley drawing millions to the park.</p>
        <p>Search and rescue costs soared, as well. Several dozen students from a boarding school near Detroit were stranded in Great Smoky Mountains National Park during a March blizzard, and the air and ground search cost $100,000. Other incidents cost hundreds of thousands more, and rescue operations this year are already more than 10 times as high as last year's total.</p>
        <p>Yosemite National Park in California, with its four million visitors a year, is a good example of a park that is not able to keep up with demand.</p>
        <p>Two campgrounds at the park, at Bridalveil Creek and Yosemite Creek, are closed this summer. They contain nearly 10 percent of the 1,900 family campsites in the park. Another campground, at Hodgdon Meadow, which usually operates all year, did not open until this month.</p>
        <p>Heavy snow and budget cuts delayed the clearing of Tioga Road in the park, forcing more visitors into the overburdened Yosemite Valley. As a result, for the first time ever, the park had to shut its gates to traffic for hours at a time on May 22 and 23 and again on Memorial Day, said Bob Clopine, a park spokesman at Yosemite.</p>
        <p>While events like these stand out, it is the day-to-day decline in services that is affecting more people.</p>
        <p>Across the park system, there have been reductions in the hiring of seasonal employees, including rangers, and that has meant cuts in the interpretive programs that educate visitors to the parks about the natural resources they are seeing.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement has also suffered. At Big Bend, a park the size of Rhode Island along the Rio Grande in Texas, there are only eight law-enforcement rangers, and there have been incidents of sniping along the river, perhaps related to drug traffic, the Wilderness Society said. Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area, linking Cleveland and Akron, Ohio, has no overnight patrols, and arson has been reported during those hours, the society said.</p>
        <p>Although visitors' safety is among the highest priorities, park service officials said some safety measures have been sacrificed. At many locations, like Cape Hatteras National Seashore, lifeguards cannot be provided at all of the beaches. Park visitors are not always well informed about potential dangers; if a ranger doesn't tell you that a black-tailed deer, even one used to humans on its territory, may lash out with its deadly hooves, you might approach too close.</p>
        <p>At Glacier National Park, with its considerable population of grizzly bears, some trails have had to be closed because inadequate maintenance poses a danger. "Bears are most likely to take on humans when they are surprised," the Wilderness Society explained in its May report, "and poorly maintained trails generally limit visibility and thus increase the likelihood that a hiker will suddenly encounter a grizzly."
