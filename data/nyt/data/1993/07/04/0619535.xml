      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Regarding the Q. &amp; A. column of June 6, which quoted from an interview with Janet S. Walker, executive director of the Westchester-Putnam School Boards Association, I am deeply disappointed that you gave so much space to a paid lobbyist with vested interests in maintaining the stutus quo in terms of school budgets. I formed a group in White Plains working to get the vote on the school budget here and in the other 56 small cities in New York State.</p>
        <p>In White Plains, we face a 13 percent increase in school taxes after a 10 percent increase last year and a 13 percent increase the year before. Our school taxes are consistently higher than our city taxes. We average a $15,500 per student yearly expenditure when the state average is $7,500 and the national average is $4,000. We have an overpaid, underworked group of teachers who instead of giving extra time for tutoring or counseling negotiate these functions as well as hall duty out of their contracts, and then blame the poor performance of their students in terms of standardized tests and ranking with their peer groups on the diversity of the student population.</p>

        <p>In White Plains, we face a 13 percent increase in school taxes after a 10 percent increase last year and a 13 percent increase the year before. Our school taxes are consistently higher than our city taxes. We average a $15,500 per student yearly expenditure when the state average is $7,500 and the national average is $4,000.

        <p>We have dozens of administrators in the high school who see their main function as disciplinarians instead of mentors or role models. Since I have a thorough knowledge of statistics and possess some plain common sense, I know the state study was not flawed. I applaud the state and Governor Cuomo in their efforts to monitor the excesses in the bureaucracy that Ms. Katz is paid to defend.</p>
        <p>I suggest that all people in Westchester concerned with the high cost of educating our youngsters read the report "Nation at Risk" and the Merritt Lindsey Report. The need to defend raising taxes by such school teacher verbiage as micro, macro, mini-macro is nonsense.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is that the product you are turning out is not competitive in the real world because the school establishment doesn't live in the real world. Get real -- this is no longer a farm economy -- children need more than 185 days of school and who says throwing good money after bad will provide "quality" education? ROSELYN KATZ White Plains</p>
