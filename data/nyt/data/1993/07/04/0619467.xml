        <p>I moved to New York in 1989 from Italy and immediately got health insurance with Empire Blue Cross. I was about to get married and chose the most comprehensive (and expensive) program to cover all possible maternity costs.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Further to your articles about Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield: I'm not a doctor. I'm not a hospital. I'm just one of the thousands "covered."</p>
        <p>I moved to New York in 1989 from Italy and immediately got health insurance with Empire Blue Cross. I was about to get married and chose the most comprehensive (and expensive) program to cover all possible maternity costs. In August 1991, I gave birth to a daughter in Lenox Hill Hospital and immediately after submitted claims for obstetrician and anesthesia. The hospital submitted its bill directly to the company.</p>
        <p>After a month I received a bill from Lenox Hill for nursery charges. At my request for explanation, the hospital replied that my program covered all maternity charges for me, not for my baby. At three weeks, Arielle was getting her first bill!</p>
        <p>Another month went by, and I did not receive my money for the other expenses. I called Empire Blue Cross, and the operator told me a check for $3,600 had been sent the month before. I asked her to check again, I hadn't received it, and she said with annoyance, "We sent it to your address in Astoria." I've always lived in Manhattan. I've never lived in Astoria, and why did all the bills arrive at the right address, and the only payment go somewhere else?</p>
        <p>Empire Blue Cross had sent a check in my name to somebody else's address. That person cashed it, and unless he returned the money, Blue Cross would not pay me back.</p>
        <p>I waited a month and went directly to the insurer's headquarters, hoping to get somebody's attention. After I had waited on line all morning, a clerk, chewing her lunch, told me that they must have had the wrong information in the computer.</p>
        <p>To get an investigation going, I had to sign an affidavit confirming that the signature on the back of the check was not mine.</p>
        <p>I sent the documentation and waited two months. Nothing happened. I called again, and another bored operator told me Empire Blue Cross never received any affidavit. I sent a copy. After some time, I received a letter asking me to be patient because these matters could take a long time. That was the last I heard.</p>
        <p>My baby is now 2 years old, and I haven't seen a penny.</p>
        <p>The American health system makes me smile nostalgically for my chaotic Italy, where doctors visit you at home day and night, deliver your babies, save your life in an emergency and in payment ask you to stop by the house some time for a glass of wine. As my father and grandfather did for their patients for almost a century. SCIASCIA GAMBACCINI BARON New York, June 23, 1993</p>
