        <p>An epidemic of a mysterious illness that has afflicted more than 46,000 people in Cuba apparently has peaked, with a decline in the number of new cases reported in the last month, a Cuban Government health official said here this week.</p>
        <p>But the cause of the nonfatal disease, which impairs vision and damages nerves, continues to baffle delegations of international scientists who have gone to Cuba to investigate.</p>
        <p>A number of theories have been advanced to explain the epidemic, among them nutritional deficiency, viral infection, chronic cyanide poisoning and an unidentified toxin.</p>
        <p>"Every doctor, every person has an opinion," but none explains all the findings, Dr. Jorge V. Antelo, Cuba's Deputy Health Minister, said in an interview on Thursday night. New Level of Cooperation</p>
        <p>"My mind is open to all possibilities," Dr. Antelo said. He said he suspected that the cause would turn out to be a combination of factors.</p>
        <p>"So far, much evidence points to a new disease," Dr. Antelo said. He was visiting the United States to discuss the epidemic with officials of the Pan American Health Organization here and with scientists at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., who are testing the blood and other samples they brought back from Cuba.</p>
        <p>The ability of medical experts from Cuba and the United States to work together in investigating the epidemic reflects a new level of cooperation between the two countries in a number of areas. This week an unofficial delegation of retired American military officers and defense experts visited Havana to discuss ways of reducing tensions.</p>
        <p>Although no medical expert excludes the possibility that a new disease has emerged, some specialists, like Dr. Peter S. Spencer, a toxicologist and neurologist at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, said they would be "very, very surprised" if that proved true.</p>
        <p>"We've barely begun to rule out things," Dr. Spencer said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Antelo, Dr. Spencer and other experts said much work needed to be done to determine the cause of the disease, which can produce two different patterns of illness. One affects the eyes primarily, leading to loss of central and color vision, but not full blindness.</p>
        <p>A second form affects the nerves in the hands and feet, producing a "pins and needles" feeling and burning sensation, muscle cramps, weakness of the legs and staggering gait. Some have suffered hearing loss, but not full deafness. Nerve damage can also lead to difficulty in swallowing, speaking and urinating.</p>
        <p>Many people suffer from a combination of both forms. 25,000 Admitted to Hospitals</p>
        <p>Dr. Antelo said more than 25,000 Cubans had been admitted to hospitals, usually for 11 to 20 days. The number of new cases has been dropping since May 30, about a month after the Cuban Government began distributing multivitamin pills to the entire population of 10.8 million.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Antelo cautioned against drawing a cause-and-effect conclusion, for a number of reasons. One is that a vitamin deficiency does not explain why the disease has struck Cubans so selectively, hitting adults from 25 to 64 hardest, affecting those over 65 to a lesser extent and virtually sparing children under 15.</p>
        <p>Also, Dr. Antelo said Cuban officials were wary about declaring that the worst was over, because a second wave of cases has occurred in one province. And Dr. Spencer said a Cuban health worker had told him about five patients who had suffered relapses after being discharged from a hospital, suggesting that they might have been re-exposed to whatever caused the disease.</p>
        <p>Dr. Antelo said it would have been easy for Cuban officials to declare that the disease was due to a nutritional problem and complain that it resulted from Washington's 30-year trade embargo against Cuba. But he said Cuban health officials were seeking a more definitive cause.</p>
        <p>The disease first appeared three years ago in a rural area in Pinar del Rio Province in western Cuba. Initially, most cases were among men who smoked and drank alcohol.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the epidemic exploded, spreading eastward and changing its pattern. The number of smokers dropped to about 50 percent from 93 percent, and larger numbers of women have been afflicted.</p>
        <p>Cases have been reported in all 14 Cuban provinces, but with widely varying incidence in each area, Dr. Antelo said. In one province, there were cases in six municipalities but none in the remaining two.</p>
        <p>Studies have shown no evidence of contagion, spread within families, or clustering of cases in schools or workplaces, and no difference in incidence among Cubans who had traveled to Angola or elsewhere in the world, said Dr. Antelo and Dr. Gustavo Roman, an expert in the epidemiology of nervous system diseases at the National Institutes of Health who has gone to Cuba to investigate the epidemic. No Cases Among Foreigners</p>
        <p>No cases have been reported elsewhere in the world, reducing the likelihood of an infectious agent, and no cases are known to have occurred among tourists or foreigners living in Cuba, Dr. Antelo said. "That's why we keep scratching our heads," he added.</p>
        <p>Dr. Antelo said five international teams of scientists were now in Cuba investigating the outbreak.</p>
        <p>In expressing gratitude for the scientific community's response to Cuban health needs, Dr. Antelo said, "The thing we want most is to solve this epidemic."</p>
