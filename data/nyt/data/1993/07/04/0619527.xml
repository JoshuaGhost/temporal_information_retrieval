        <p>Television producers have always known that violence can be a hot-selling product. But this week they faced up to the political corollary: attacking television violence is also a crowd-pleasing political cause, embraced as easily by liberal Democrats as by conservative Christian groups.</p>
        <p>With pressure building in Congress for a rating system or even time restrictions, the four commercial networks ran for cover and announced that they would run a new parental warning in advance of violent shows. The warning -- "Due to some violent content, parental discretion advised" -- will also be used in advance promotions and available for program listings. It will appear this fall.</p>

        <p>Television producers have always known that violence can be a hot-selling product. But this week they faced up to the political corollary: attacking television violence is also a crowd-pleasing political cause, embraced as easily by liberal Democrats as by conservative Christian groups.</p>
        <p>With pressure building in Congress for a rating system or even time restrictions, the four commercial networks ran for cover and announced that they would run a new parental warning in advance of violent shows. The warning -- "Due to some violent content, parental discretion advised" -- will also be used in advance promotions and available for program listings. It will appear this fall.</p>
        <p>The real target appears to be gratuitous, glamorized violence. A program like "Murder, She Wrote," in which the killing usually takes place off-screen, would not need an advisory but the forthcoming "NYPD Blue," which is loaded with killing and foul language, would.</p>
        <p>Everyone concedes that the new warning is a tame step, given that the networks will decide what shows merit the advisories. Nevertheless, some advertisers are almost certain to bolt from shows that do get the label -- and that, in turn could reduce the volume of murder and mayhem.</p>
