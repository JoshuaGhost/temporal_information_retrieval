        <p>It's tempting to criticize the decision by the International Trade Commission to eliminate many of the tariffs that protect American steel producers from foreign competition. After all, the Commerce Department had ruled that many foreign suppliers were violating U.S. trade laws by selling at prices that did not cover their costs -- an injustice the tariffs were designed to correct.</p>
        <p>But the criticism is off target. The commission's decision is a model of professional discretion. It carefully sifted the data to determine, as U.S. law requires, whether foreign subsidies and price cutting had injured the large, integrated steel mills that brought the complaints. What the commission found was that in many cases the foreign imports weren't the villain.</p>

        <p>It's tempting to criticize the decision by the International Trade Commission to eliminate many of the tariffs that protect American steel producers from foreign competition. After all, the Commerce Department had ruled that many foreign suppliers were violating U.S. trade laws by selling at prices that did not cover their costs -- an injustice the tariffs were designed to correct.</p>
        <p>But the criticism is off target. The commission's decision is a model of professional discretion. It carefully sifted the data to determine, as U.S. law requires, whether foreign subsidies and price cutting had injured the large, integrated steel mills that brought the complaints. What the commission found was that in many cases the foreign imports weren't the villain.</p>
        <p>The large mills have lost business, and racked up huge losses, primarily because of the explosive growth of other American producers -- the minimills that cut costs by using scrap metal and non-union labor. The commission's staff also showed that imported steel often sold at higher prices than American steel because of its high quality or availability.</p>
        <p>The commission came down in favor of one set of domestic producers -- the thousands of manufacturers that use steel -- over another, the large integrated mills that sell steel. That was not only the right legal decision but also the best choice for the economy because it will protect the jobs of thousands of American workers in steel-using industries -- everything from baseball cleats to automobile parts. And by lowering manufacturing costs, the commission's decisions will lead to lower prices for millions of consumers.</p>
        <p>The rulings were not all bad news for big steel manufacturers. Where the evidence justified it, the commission slapped heavy tariffs on selected products -- such as rust-resistant steel imported from Japan.</p>
        <p>The commission's work (despite the "international" in its title, it's a Federal agency) is governed by laws against unfair foreign exports. These laws are hopelessly biased in favor of the domestic industry that brings a complaint. They find unfair price-cutting and domestic injury where none exist. But the evidence in this case couldn't meet even this easy test. The commission honored itself (and helped the economy) by taking each case separately and making decisions on the merits.</p>
        <p>The battle over steel tariffs is far from over. The industry took about three nanoseconds to decide to take its case to Capitol Hill, where it hopes to win with politics what it couldn't with economics. Congress and President Clinton will be lobbied hard for quotas that can only hurt steel-using manufacturers, their workers and millions of consumers.</p>
        <p>The commission got it right, and Congress ought to leave matters alone.</p>
