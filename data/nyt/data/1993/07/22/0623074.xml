        <p>District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn yesterday attacked a state report that said lapses by his office had contributed to the acquittal of the lone youth prosecuted in the slaying of a Hasidic man during the 1991 Crown Heights violence.</p>
        <p>Declaring that he had been "involved in all phases of the case and made the key decisions," Mr. Hynes said that his office's work had been "diligent, competent and professional" and that the state report "displays a misunderstanding of trial tactics."</p>

        <p>District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn yesterday attacked a state report that said lapses by his office had contributed to the acquittal of the lone youth prosecuted in the slaying of a Hasidic man during the 1991 Crown Heights violence.</p>
        <p>Declaring that he had been "involved in all phases of the case and made the key decisions," Mr. Hynes said that his office's work had been "diligent, competent and professional" and that the state report "displays a misunderstanding of trial tactics."</p>
        <p>In a 23-page statement, Mr. Hynes sought to rebut the report's major criticisms of his office's gathering of forensic evidence, its presentation of inconsistent police testimony and its argument to the jury during the 1992 trial that ended with the acquittal of 17-year-old Lemrick Nelson Jr. on murder and manslaughter charges.</p>
        <p>The acquittal and the report were blows to Mr. Hynes, who made his reputation as the successful special prosecutor in the Howard Beach racial attack case and who is thought to have statewide political aspirations.</p>
        <p>One of the criticisms Mr. Hynes addressed in his rebuttal was that it was a "critical omission" for the prosecution not to have requested testing of Mr. Nelson's pants pockets to determine whether a stain in one pocket was blood and, if so, whether it was consistent with that of the victim, 29-year-old Yankel Rosenbaum. Police witnesses testified that a bloodstained knife was found in a pocket of Mr. Nelson's pants when he was arrested minutes after the stabbing, and forensic tests showed that the blood on the knife was consistent with Mr. Rosenbaum's.</p>
        <p>After the medical examiner's office failed to test the pants pockets, the trial prosecutors, Sari Kolatch and James Leeper, did not resubmit the jeans for testing "because they did not see any blood stains on the pockets when they examined them."</p>
        <p>"The absence of a visible blood stain in the right pocket of the defendant's jeans was not unexpected," Mr. Hynes said, because "the blood had been absorbed by three $1 bills that were recovered from the right pocket along with the knife," and these bills were stained with blood consistent with that of Mr. Rosenbaum.</p>
        <p>The victim, a Hasidic scholar from Australia, was attacked by a roving band of black youths on the first of four days of violence after a car driven by a Hasidic man struck and killed a black child.  Officer's Testimony Defended</p>
        <p>The report also suggested that the prosecutors had erred by presenting testimony from a police officer who contradicted several others about Mr. Nelson's apprehension, including how the officers handled the knife they said they found on the youth. The report said the testimony had "created doubts about the officers' credibility."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hynes said that reconciling the inconsistencies "would have involved telling one or more of the police officers that they had to contour their testimony in order to make it more consistent with the testimony of other witnesses." This, he said, would have been "ethically impermissible."</p>
        <p>In any event, he insisted, the officer's testimony had in fact "corroborated the essential points of the accounts" of the other officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes also took issue with a suggestion in the state report that the prosecution, in its final argument to the jury, should have addressed more fully the legal theory of acting in concert, which involves shared culpability among members of a group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes, noting that "from the outset the thrust of the prosecution's case" had been that Mr. Nelson had personally wielded the knife, declared, "It would have been absurd to argue to the jury that Nelson should have been convicted because others with him in the group kicked Yankel Rosenbaum while he stabbed him."</p>
