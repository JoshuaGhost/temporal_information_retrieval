        <p>Len Berman, the WNBC-TV/Channel 4 sports broadcaster whose tenure as a sports talk show host at WFAN Radio started rancorously in April, was released amicably from his one-year deal on the noon-2 P.M. time slot. Today is his last show.</p>
        <p>Berman claimed, even before starting at WFAN, that the radio job would deprive him of time with his family. To accommodate him, the station changed plans to pair Berman from 10 A.M. to 2 P.M. with Mike Lupica by placing Lupica in the 10 A.M. to noon slot.</p>

        <p>"It's really about my life," Berman said. "I had second thoughts before I signed, but I was willing to fulfill the contract. It seemed like a good idea at first, but when I sat back, I realized it wasn't."</p>
