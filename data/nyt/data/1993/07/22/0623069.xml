        <p>The New York Times Company yesterday reported second-quarter earnings of $22.4 million, or 28 cents a share, up from $14 million, or 18 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1992.</p>
        <p>The 1992 results were depressed by a labor disruption at The New York Times and an operating loss at The Gwinnett Daily News in Georgia, which was later closed. Adjusting for those items, the 1992 profit would have been 27 cents a share.</p>

        <p>The New York Times Company yesterday reported second-quarter earnings of $22.4 million, or 28 cents a share, up from $14 million, or 18 cents a share, in the second quarter of 1992.</p>
        <p>The 1992 results were depressed by a labor disruption at The New York Times and an operating loss at The Gwinnett Daily News in Georgia, which was later closed. Adjusting for those items, the 1992 profit would have been 27 cents a share.</p>
        <p>Higher profits for the broadcasting group in the recent quarter were largely offset by a decline in results for the company's magazines.</p>
        <p>Revenue in the quarter was $483.6 million, up 9 percent from $443.2 million a year earlier. More Spent to Buy Stock</p>
        <p>The Times Company also said it had spent an additional $52 million to repurchase its stock.</p>
        <p>The company has agreed to acquire Affiliated Publications Inc., which owns The Boston Globe, in a stock and cash deal worth about $1.1 billion. After that agreement was announced on June 11, Times Company stock came under pressure and the company began buying its shares.</p>
        <p>The company said last week that it had spent $100 million from June 21 to July 15 on such purchases. It said yesterday that it had spent an additional $52 million in the last four trading days.</p>
        <p>Based on trading volume and prices in that four-day period, it appears that the company bought 2.1 million shares, or about 78 percent of the shares traded during the period, bringing its total purchases to about 6.2 million shares. The company has said it will spend up to $250 million to repurchase its stock.</p>
        <p>Shares of The New York Times Company gained 25 cents yesterday, closing at $25 on the American Stock Exchange. The earnings were announced after the stock market closed. Operating Earnings Are Up</p>
        <p>In the earnings announcement, the Times Company said its newspaper group had operating earnings of $41.8 million. That was up sharply from $30.8 million a year earlier because the 1992 operating earnings included an $11 million pretax cost in connection with the labor problems, which disrupted delivery of newspapers in the New York City area. The company noted that operating earnings would have been flat without the labor cost.</p>
        <p>The newspaper group consists of The New York Times, 31 regional newspapers, a wholesale distribution company in New York and a 50 percent interest in The International Herald Tribune.</p>
        <p>The company said increased circulation revenues and higher advertising rates helped the results, as did cost controls and production savings from a new printing plant built by The Times in Edison, N.J. But those gains were offset by higher depreciation expenses, largely related to the new plant, and by rising newsprint costs.</p>
        <p>Advertising linage at The Times was 19.8 million lines in the quarter, the same as a year earlier, with the figures strengthening late in the period. The newspaper's circulation reached a record of 1.2 million copies daily and 1.8 million on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The magazine group reported operating profits of $8.2 million for the quarter, before amortization costs from the acquisitions of two magazines, down from $9.1 million in the comparable period of 1992. Softness in consumer packaged goods advertising in women's magazines was cited as the main cause of the decline.</p>
        <p>The company's broadcasting and information services group reported that operating profits rose to $5.7 million, from $4.5 million a year earlier, largely because of higher advertising revenues at the company's television stations.  COMPANY REPORTS</p>
