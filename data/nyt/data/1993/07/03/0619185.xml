        <p>The Federal Communications Commission voted 2 to 1 today to give television stations devoted to round-the-clock shopping the same right as regular broadcasters to demand that cable television systems carry their programs.</p>
        <p>The decision is a windfall for the Home Shopping Network, which pioneered the all-shopping format and is carried on a number of cable systems. The network also broadcasts by satellite to about 100 small stations around the country. Those stations, often situated just outside big cities, will enjoy a much broader reach if they are carried on cable.</p>

        <p>The Federal Communications Commission voted 2 to 1 today to give television stations devoted to round-the-clock shopping the same right as regular broadcasters to demand that cable television systems carry their programs.</p>
        <p>The decision is a windfall for the Home Shopping Network, which pioneered the all-shopping format and is carried on a number of cable systems. The network also broadcasts by satellite to about 100 small stations around the country. Those stations, often situated just outside big cities, will enjoy a much broader reach if they are carried on cable.</p>
        <p>Home Shopping and another shopping network, QVC, dominate the home shopping industry, each generating about $1 billion in sales.</p>
        <p>The decision could, however, force smaller cable systems to drop some programming because channel capacity is still limited, despite rapid advances in technology.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups and some members of Congress quickly attacked the ruling. Congress has insisted that cable systems should be forced to carry broadcast stations on the theory that broadcasters provide a unique public service. But it told the F.C.C. to decide by today whether home shopping stations met the same public-interest standard.</p>
        <p>Home Shopping Network has argued that it fulfills the public-service requirements of broadcast stations. Company officials contend that access to cable systems is crucial because 60 percent of all homes now receive television by cable. A Voice of Dissent</p>
        <p>The F.C.C.'s one dissenting commissioner, Ervin S. Duggan, said today that the agency had surrendered its ability to define the public-interest responsibilities of broadcasters.</p>
        <p>"Today, sadly, the commission put forward a minimalist definition of the public-interest standard, at precisely the moment when we should be mending and refurbishing that tattered banner," Mr. Duggan said in a statement.</p>
        <p>At issue is what is known as the must-carry rule, a provision of the cable regulation law passed by Congress last fall. The rule requires cable operators to carry all local over-the-air television stations that request to be carried.</p>
        <p>Agency officials have been stewing over the home shopping issue for weeks. On the one hand, many say it would be perverse to help round-the-clock advertising at the expense of programming like C-SPAN. But having lifted most restrictions in 1984 on the amount of advertising a station can carry, the agency is now loath to make a judgment about the value of one television format over another.</p>
        <p>The agency's acting chairman, James H. Quello, is a former broadcaster who sided with the home shopping stations. Mr. Quello had hoped to issue a decision last week, but abruptly postponed the decision amid objections from Mr. Duggan and from Representative John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Competitive Factor Considered</p>
        <p>In deciding that home shopping stations do serve the public interest, the commission said the format had been highly successful in capturing viewers and provided competition to 24-hour shopping channels operated by cable companies. The biggest of these is the QVC Network, which is owned by Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver and the Comcast Corporation of Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>In general, cable systems pay to carry particular networks, but in the case of the Home Shopping Network the cable operators are paid a portion of the sales generated by the network. Under the cable act enacted last fall, local over-the-air broadcast stations were given the choice of either demanding that a cable system carry their signal or insisting that a cable system negotiate the right to carry the signal.</p>
        <p>The first option favors smaller stations that cable systems would not want to carry; the second favors big stations that have bargaining power. Cable systems do not want to be forced to carry local over-the-air affiliates of Home Shopping, because those stations would not be obliged to pay them.</p>
        <p>Alan Gerson, senior vice president of Home Shopping Network, praised the decision. "We believe the commission reached the only decision it could: the just conclusion, the fair conclusion," he said. "Our programming is neither violent nor prurient, and it contains no strong language. It is a unique live interactive blend of information, entertainment, audience participation and commercial elements which are popular and wholesome." Not All Commercials</p>
        <p>The shares of Home Shopping were among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange today and posted the largest percentage gain, rising $1.25 each, to $12.875.  To meet the agency's minimum standard for serving the public interest, home shopping stations typically carry five minutes of community programming each hour, as well as several hours of noncommercial programs on Sunday mornings.</p>
        <p>But critics said the decision was a mistake. "The commission missed an opportunity to adddress the issue of whether television licensees should be permitted to broadcast commercials in whatever form, virtually 24 hours a day," Representative Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, said.</p>
        <p>Officials at C-SPAN, which provides coverage of government proceedings and political events, said the must-carry rule, which is beginning to take effect now, has already prompted 10 small cable systems to drop C-SPAN in favor of local broadcast stations. The decision on home shopping will only add to the pressure, they said.</p>
        <p>"This F.C.C. ruling is bad news for us," said Susan Swain, senior vice president of C-SPAN, which is based in Washington. "It's hard to understand how a home shopping network better serves the public interest than live coverage of Congress."</p>
