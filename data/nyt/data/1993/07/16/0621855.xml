        <p>A little piece of New York's cultural history will be restored this weekend with the reopening of the Thalia Theater, the quintessential New York City art-film revival house at 95th Street, just west of Broadway. Until it was closed in 1987, the Thalia was a mecca for cineastes who wanted to bone up on their Cocteau, Kurosawa and Welles.</p>
        <p>Built in 1931, the 292-seat theater was architecturally novel for its times. Its Art Moderne design, by Raymond Irrera and Ben Schlanger, incorporated such innovations as indirect lighting and a sloping floor. Beginning in 1938, under the direction of Martin Lewis, it offered a steady stream of foreign films. After he died in 1955, the repertory expanded to include classic Hollywood movies. From 1977 to 1987, under the direction of Richard Schwarz, the programming became more offbeat and esoteric. During its peak years, the Thalia was famous for its inky darkness, its tiny screen and the intense concentration of its audiences.</p>

        <p>A little piece of New York's cultural history will be restored this weekend with the reopening of the Thalia Theater, the quintessential New York City art-film revival house at 95th Street, just west of Broadway. Until it was closed in 1987, the Thalia was a mecca for cineastes who wanted to bone up on their Cocteau, Kurosawa and Welles.</p>
        <p>Built in 1931, the 292-seat theater was architecturally novel for its times. Its Art Moderne design, by Raymond Irrera and Ben Schlanger, incorporated such innovations as indirect lighting and a sloping floor. Beginning in 1938, under the direction of Martin Lewis, it offered a steady stream of foreign films. After he died in 1955, the repertory expanded to include classic Hollywood movies. From 1977 to 1987, under the direction of Richard Schwarz, the programming became more offbeat and esoteric. During its peak years, the Thalia was famous for its inky darkness, its tiny screen and the intense concentration of its audiences.</p>
        <p>The Thalia has been renovated by Roy Ennacheril, who owns the Grand Metro Hardware and Furniture U.S.A. stores in the neighborhood. It will be operated by his partner, Rick Azar, who has a background in arts administration and film production.</p>
        <p>Marcel Carne's "Enfants du Paradis" ("Children of Paradise") is the perfect film to begin the Thalia's new life. This 1945 French classic about theater people in the Paris of Balzac is at once a heart-tugging popular epic and an allegorical evocation of varieties of love and styles of performance. It plays tomorrow through Monday, with screenings at 3 and 7 P.M.</p>
        <p>From Tuesday through Thursday, the Thalia will show the Japanese director Kenji Mizoguchi's films "Osaka Elegy" and "Sisters of the Gion," both made in 1936.  Next weekend, it will offer a double bill of the Coen brothers' films "Miller's Crossing" and "Barton Fink."</p>
        <p>Tickets are $6.50, with discounts for the elderly before 5 P.M. Information: (212) 316-4962.</p>
