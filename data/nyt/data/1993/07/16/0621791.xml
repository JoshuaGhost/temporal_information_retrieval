        <p>A controversial artist who employs other artists to conceive and execute paintings sold under his signature has himself been the subject of an appropriation, Federal prosecutors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The prosecutors accuse two employees of Mark Kostabi's art-production house, a painter and a sales representative, of creating and selling additional works without Mr. Kostabi's knowledge, forging his signature and pocketing the proceeds.</p>
        <p>To the Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, it is a case of criminal conspiracy and fraud. To one of the lawyers for the accused, it is a case of unwarranted charges.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Kostabi, a flamboyant artist with a flair for self-promotion who once said that "for me, marketing is a rest from painting and painting is a rest from marketing," it is an opportunity, if not an invited one, to expatiate on the purposes and processes of Kostabi World, the Manhattan studio he presides over. In the Tradition</p>
        <p>It is a place where a dozen employees under his supervision -- "idea people," painters, a "titling person" -- turn out 200 to 2,000 paintings a year, Mr. Kostabi said yesterday, selling for $4,000 to $50,000 apiece. He said the studio, which recently moved to SoHo from midtown Manhattan, is in the tradition of great masters like Rembrandt and Rubens and such contemporaries as Andy Warhol, all of whom had studios at which assistants helped them produce their works.</p>
        <p>To those critics who insist that he presides over an assembly-line school of creation, and who question the artistic quality and the extent of Mr. Kostabi's involvement in his work, the 32-year-old artist said that the volume of sales to private collectors and corporations speaks for itself. He added that he not only monitors the stages of production of his work, with the aid of consultants, but also does not sign it unless it passes his final review.</p>
        <p>The United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn says that 30 paintings bearing Mr. Kostabi's name, without his knowledge, did not go through the process he described. Rather, prosecutors charge, one of the painters he employed did some unauthorized moonlighting at his own Brooklyn loft, turning out works imitating what Mr. Kostabi described as his studio's "social surrealism." Then a sales representative arranged to sell the works for what a prosecutor, Jonathan D. Polkes, called a "considerable amount" of money that the two employees shared.</p>
        <p>The salesman, Andrew Behrman, 32, of Manhattan, was indicted yesterday on five conspiracy and fraud counts, each punishable by up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. After surrendering, he pleaded not guilty in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and was released on a $10,000 personal recognizance bond.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berhrman's lawyer, Stuart Abrams, said after the arraignment: "I'm sure everyone will sleep more soundly knowing that the Government is defending Mr. Kostabi in this case. We're very sorry the Government has chosen to bring these charges, which we think are without any basis, and Mr. Behrman expects to be vindicated at trial."</p>
        <p>The painter he is accused of working with was not charged or identified. Mr. Polkes would provide no information on him and declined to comment on whether he had made a deal to to cooperate with the authorities in exchange for leniency.</p>
        <p>The unauthorized works range in size from about 20 by 20 inches to several feet long and wide, Mr. Polkes said. The Kostabi World style that the unauthorized works imitated is a style, Mr. Kostabi said, featuring such images as "faceless figures which reflect society's fear of individuality."</p>
