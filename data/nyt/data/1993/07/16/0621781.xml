        <p>Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President, spent a prodigious $6.4 million on his doomed quest for the mayor's office before dropping out of the race in late May, his campaign's final campaign finance filing shows.</p>
        <p>In the last six months alone, Mr. Stein -- who refused to abide by the voluntary contribution limits in the city's campaign finance law -- spent nearly $3.4 million, most of it for a television advertising campaign in April and May that in the end did not raise his popularity above 16 percent. But Mr. Stein also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on voter registration drives, polling, and various high-priced political consultants, the records show.</p>

        <p>Andrew J. Stein, the City Council President, spent a prodigious $6.4 million on his doomed quest for the mayor's office before dropping out of the race in late May, his campaign's final campaign finance filing shows.</p>
        <p>In the last six months alone, Mr. Stein -- who refused to abide by the voluntary contribution limits in the city's campaign finance law -- spent nearly $3.4 million, most of it for a television advertising campaign in April and May that in the end did not raise his popularity above 16 percent. But Mr. Stein also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on voter registration drives, polling, and various high-priced political consultants, the records show.</p>
        <p>So heavy was his spending that as of yesterday the campaign still owed nearly $309,000 and had only $25,437 on hand. He also borrowed more than $745,000 that he has yet to repay, most of it from his brother, James Finkelstein, an editor, and their father, Jerry Finkelstein, the publisher.</p>
