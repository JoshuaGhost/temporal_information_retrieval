        <p>Nassau County prosecutors today released a chilling inventory of items they said had been found in searches of Joel Rifkin's bedroom, garage and pickup trucks. The list included books about serial murders and tying knots and 75 pieces of women's jewelry.</p>
        <p>The six-page list was released on the same day that prosecutors gave a grand jury evidence in the death of Tiffany Bresciani, 22, whose body was found in the back of Mr. Rifkin's pickup truck when two state police troopers arrested him on June 28.</p>

        <p>Nassau County prosecutors today released a chilling inventory of items they said had been found in searches of Joel Rifkin's bedroom, garage and pickup trucks. The list included books about serial murders and tying knots and 75 pieces of women's jewelry.</p>
        <p>The six-page list was released on the same day that prosecutors gave a grand jury evidence in the death of Tiffany Bresciani, 22, whose body was found in the back of Mr. Rifkin's pickup truck when two state police troopers arrested him on June 28.</p>
        <p>Though the police say Mr. Rifkin, 34, an unemployed gardener, has confessed to killing 17 women, and credit cards taken from his bedroom last week linked him to an 18th death, the Nassau County grand jury will consider only Ms. Bresciani's death because she was the only victim found in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>The grand jury is expected to indict Mr. Rifkin tomorrow, with arraignment likely later this week, said Ed Grilli, a spokesman for prosecutor's office. Pink Sock and a Hair Curler</p>
        <p>Listed today among the things found in Mr. Rifkin's room was "The Green River Killings," a book about what remains the nation's lengthiest string of unsolved murders, in which the bodies of 49 prostitutes were dumped along the Green River south of Seattle in the 1980's. Most of Mr. Rifkin's victims have been identified as prostitutes.</p>
        <p>Other books were "Ropes and Knots" and Shere Hite's "Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress." The 1987 book, a controversial report on marital infidelity, concluded that 70 percent of women married for more than five years were having affairs.</p>
        <p>And there was more: heavy and thin ropes, a bag of unidentified "boney matter," 17 rolls of film, videotapes and legal pads crammed with personal writings. A blue metal safe held 48 pieces of women's jewelry, and the police found another cache of 27 baubles. They found women's clothes: a pair of gray stretch tights with one pink sock still attached, a black sweater with white balls, a pair of black suede pants, a blue Lycra skirt, shoes and a hair curler.</p>
        <p>The first search of Mr. Rifkin's house, garage and one truck in East Meadow was done the same night the troopers stopped him for driving without license plates.</p>
        <p>While investigators had earlier mentioned several items taken from Mr. Rifkin's home -- including a blood-soaked orange wheelbarrow and women's underclothes -- today's list was the first thorough accounting of the items seized in that first search. The inventory did not include items taken in a far more extensive search of the home and surrounding grounds that the police conducted with specially trained dogs last Thursday.</p>
        <p>The sheer array of women's belongings raised questions about how Mr. Rifkin collected such a pile of personal effects -- much of it left in plain sight in his cluttered room -- without arousing the suspicion of his sister, Jan, 31, or his mother, Jeanne, 71, with whom he lived. Some of Story Doubtful</p>
        <p>Mr. Rifkin's lawyer, Robert Sale, has challenged the propriety of the June 28 search and last week asked the Nassau County District Attorney to investigate the way it was conducted. While Mr. Sale would not disclose the results of the inquiry, Mr. Grilli said the prosecutor had found "nothing to corroborate Mr. Sale's allegations."</p>
        <p>Of the 18 killings, the police have so far identified 10 women by name, either through Mr. Rifkin's confession or through evidence found at his home and in his pickup trucks.</p>
        <p>Another four bodies recovered by the police in the region are believed linked to Mr. Rifkin, though the remains have not been identified by name. The bodies of four more women the police believe Mr. Rifkin strangled have yet to be found.</p>
