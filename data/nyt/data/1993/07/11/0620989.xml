        <p>Shaken and bruised, Alex sits at the computer keyboard, hours after having been beaten up by a gang. He is angry, he is scared, and he wants to write about what happened to him. For help in getting started, he asks an invisible friend, Ghostwriter, who communicates only by writing. On Alex's screen appears Ghostwriter's advice: "Tell me one thing you saw." Prodded by Ghostwriter, Alex begins a sentence about the hands of the boys who hurt him.</p>

        <p>Shaken and bruised, Alex sits at the computer keyboard, hours after having been beaten up by a gang. He is angry, he is scared, and he wants to write about what happened to him. For help in getting started, he asks an invisible friend, Ghostwriter, who communicates only by writing. On Alex's screen appears Ghostwriter's advice: "Tell me one thing you saw." Prodded by Ghostwriter, Alex begins a sentence about the hands of the boys who hurt him.</p>
        <p>"How do you feel now?" asks Ghostwriter. "Better," says Alex as he sees his anger released in words.</p>
        <p>"Ghostwriter," the newest PBS show from the creators of "Sesame Street," has won a devoted following as a hip, gritty mystery about six young friends in Brooklyn, including Alex, who solve cases with Ghostwriter by using their reading and writing skills. The show aims to help 6- to 11-year-olds understand the power of words. It also dwells on issues like homelessness and drug addiction and, while many parents would like to shield their children from such real-life problems, "Ghostwriter" has caught on after just one season. It is the kind of program that children talk about with one another the morning after they've seen it -- a water-cooler show for the grade-school set.</p>
        <p>When children were invited to write letters to the show, 246,000 did so. Many wrote about themselves, offered their own solutions to the mysteries, or wrote in code -- a favorite "Ghostwriter" team activity.</p>
        <p>About 750,000 children watched "Ghostwriter" during its first three months, according to Nielsen ratings, and at one time or another it has reached one in four households with children ages 6 to 11. (Roughly 1.4 million children watch "Tiny Toon Adventures" on Fox.) Such numbers are considered good for public television, especially since viewers must follow a case through four half-hour episodes before it is solved. "Ghostwriter" is seen in back-to-back 30-minute segments, beginning at 6 P.M. Sundays on WNET in New York. Though "Ghostwriter" appeals to children of all races and incomes, it is aimed particularly at poor minority children, and the ratings data indicate that they are watching in numbers beyond their proportion in the general population.</p>
        <p>Children's Television Workshop, the creators of "Ghostwriter," seeks to encourage children to read and write outside the presence of television. With the help of corporate and foundation money, the workshop has formed partnerships with after-school programs where children can work together on Ghostwriter projects. The response here, too, suggests that children are enthusiastic. A "Ghostwriter" magazine distributed free to schools and after-school centers in low-income districts has a circulation of two million copies and a waiting list. A series of Bantam Doubleday Dell paperbacks featuring the Ghostwriter team has sold more than 600,000 copies, and all are in their second printings.</p>
        <p>"Ghostwriter" seems to work precisely because children don't put it in the it's-good-for-you category of spinach or school. The educational parts are slipped deftly into a fast-moving package of suspenseful plots, appealing characters and music that ranges from rock to hip-hop. The show's cool urban sensibility is infused by a team of creators whose credits include years at MTV and scripts for brash television comedies like "True Colors."</p>
        <p>"Our viewers at this age have such a nose for smelling out the educational message -- you can't stop the story dead for a teaching moment," said Dr. Rita Weisskoff, an educator who has researched ways of using popular media to help children's reading and writing skills and who oversees the series'educational content.</p>
        <p>Surveys conducted by Children's Television Workshop show that youngsters respond even if they are worlds away from the sometimes grim urban realities that "Ghostwriter" depicts. Children love the idea of working together to solve mysteries, said Liz Nealon, the program's executive producer. Researchers have also found that young viewers like the character of Ghostwriter, who often asks naive questions about the modern world. And they are taken by the show's unpreachy way of raising difficult moral and social issues.</p>
        <p>"What I like about 'Ghostwriter' is it helps kids to realize what's happening in the world, like toxic waste and crime," said Alex Wise, 10, who lives in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>This past season, the "Ghostwriter" team exposed a company dumping toxic waste in a community garden, cleared a team member from suspicion of shoplifting, unmasked a student who had framed a friend for acts of vandalism and found out which gang was stealing backpacks.</p>
        <p>"Ghostwriter," which is now in reruns, will begin a new season on Sept. 12, after a Labor Day special that reprises the toxic-waste segment and offers previews of coming episodes. (The special show will also feature the winner of a contest among viewers, who were asked to devise a list of possible culprits for a particular crime.) Next season, "Ghostwriter" will deal with issues like drug use and computer hacking.</p>
        <p>The show's many moments of high drama and emotion are meant to teach that reading and writing are tools children can use not only to succeed in school but also to combat obstacles in their own lives.</p>
        <p>"We create a very scary moment when kids are glued to the screen and the Ghostwriter team has got to get out of it by reading and writing," Ms. Nealon said. "And we show that the solution is not a violent one but a words-based solution."</p>
        <p>Some of the themes, like racism and violence, could be disturbing for some children. While the program does not routinely include scenes of violence, it doesn't shy away from them; poor Alex was shown being punched in the stomach. And there is the danger that "Ghostwriter" may raise false expectations of solutions, as with the episodes about toxic dumping, in which the children alert a reporter to a company's misdeeds. The show's writers consult cognitive psychologists and experts in child development, who advise them on how to present these issues in ways children can absorb.</p>
        <p>In a technique used throughout the series, the Ghostwriter character demonstrates for children specific ways they can begin to write about painful topics. At first, Alex can only type "hate, fear, hate, fear" again and again. Then Ghostwriter asks him to focus on a specific detail, and that helps him organize his thoughts.  Other reading techniques "Ghostwriter" emphasizes include learning where to get information, from the telephone book to libraries to parents.</p>
        <p>The show's emphasis on the practical and social rewards of reading and writing stems from research concluding that children do not see any personal payoff from reading, and are unmotivated to do so on their own.</p>
        <p>"So we try to show the reason why this world of literacy is something they should be part of," she said. "There is a world up on screen where kids are reading and writing their way through their lives, and they feel invited in."  TELEVISION  Correction:  July 25, 1993, Sunday</p>
