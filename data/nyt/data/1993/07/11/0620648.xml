        <p>SMALL as it is, Danbury has restaurants that reflect its varied ethnic makeup. There aren't many towns its size (population 67,000) with three Thai and three Portuguese restaurants, two each of Lebanese, Hungarian, German and Mexican, along with Cuban, Greek, French and Spanish.</p>
        <p>And that's not even counting the numerous Italian and Chinese places or the Vietnamese, Korean and other ethnic grocery stores and delicatessens in town.</p>
        <p>The following threesome, all quite new, reflect Danbury's culinary diversity, modest prices and good value.</p>
        <p>MIMI'S (275 Main Street, 730-0200), which describes itself as a "home style Italian restaurant," has a prime downtown location in generous space previously occupied by Fox &amp; Fox and other restaurants. An airy glassed-in porch is the non-smoking section and a darker Art Nouveau-style area is the smoking section. A handsome adjoining bar also has a few tables.</p>
        <p>Since it opened, Mimi's has been very popular not so much for the food -- which is standard, old-fashioned Italian, competently prepared with few menu surprises -- but for its value, which is truly exceptional. If you have a large family or a small bank account (or both), going to Mimi's could easily become a habit. And the white butcher-paper table covering plus container of crayons on each table telegraph management's encouragement of and service to children.</p>
        <p>Among examples of what makes Mimi's value so remarkable are appetizers priced from $4 to $11 and entrees from $11 to $18 prepared in quantities suitable for a party of four, not a solo diner. To illustrate, three of us one evening shared a starter of fried calamari (with both a peppery fra diavolo and a marinara dip provided) at $9 and also a Rabelaisian portion of penne with chopped eggplant, fresh mozzarella and tomato sauce at $15. Before beverages, tax or tip, we spent $24 for a satisfying two-course meal for three. Even so, we barely made a dent in the pasta, which was served heaping in a huge rectangular dish, and took the remainder home for another shared meal the next day. Garlic bread at $2.50 a serving was enough for a nearby table of five. It wasn't really necessary, though, since Italian bread and a glass bottle of herb-infused olive oil are already at each table when diners sit down.</p>
        <p>Mimi's has a small, diverse, reasonably priced wine list with some Italian and California choices as well as interesting beer selections on tap. Major credit cards are accepted and there is street-level access.</p>
        <p>CSARDA'S (250 Main Street, 794-9300) is an exceedingly modest Hungarian restaurant in an old-fashioned, high-ceiling storefront downtown. Decor is minimal but most evenings a violinist in an embroidered Hungarian vest plays gypsy music vigorously throughout the meal.</p>
        <p>Anyone nostalgic for chicken paprikash, goulash and apple strudel will find them prepared with severe simplicity, served in ample portions. Csarda's is not a showcase for Hungary's complex and intriguing cuisine, but within the framework of its ambitions it offers plain, hearty fare. One of the more successful dishes was spicy stuffed cabbage: two huge cabbage leaves stuffed with peppery ground veal, pork and rice.</p>
        <p>Transylvanian goulash consisted of veal, pork, sausage and sauerkraut in mammoth portions. The chicken soup was appealing, too, a clear, flavor-rich broth full of carrots, celery and bits of spetzle-like chicken liver dumplings. For dessert, skip the dense, overly sweet strudel and try another Hungarian specialty, palacsinta: lightly browned, delicate crepes filled with apricot jam. All entrees are $16.</p>
        <p>There is no bar but a few reasonably priced Hungarian wines are available. Major credit cards are accepted and there is street-level access; The restaurant is open for dinner only and is closed Mondays.</p>
        <p>TWO STEPS DOWNTOWN GRILLE (5 Ives Street, 794-0032), whose ownership is the same as Ciao Cafe, a popular Italian restaurant on the same street, is installed on two floors of an old firehouse. In warm weather the dining area spills over to the sidewalk, with several tables separated from passing traffic by a green picket fence.</p>
        <p>The restaurant's sign, with three-dimension cactus and an interior replete with wildly decorated boots, animals and sundry Tex-Mex paraphenalia, suggests a south-of-the-border theme.</p>
        <p>Indeed, much of the eclectic menu confirms this, though there are also Cajun items, surf and turf, Jamaican jerk chicken, chicken pot pie, home-style meat loaf and other dishes that traverse a vast culinary map. The Mexican-Southwest dishes are the most fun even though far from authentic.</p>
        <p>Fiery hot jalapeno shrimp was fiery and flavorful, but avoid the curious guacamole served with it, which had the emphatic suggestion of a mayonnaise base. Chicken and white bean chili was a novel switch from the usual chili and was surprisingly tasty. Whole wheat burritos with shrimp and chorizo, or chicken and bean, made a sizable entree for $8.95 or $7.95.</p>
        <p>Prices, as at most Danbury restaurants, are on the low end of the Fairfield County scale, with entrees from $4.95 (pizza) to $16.95 (surf and turf), with the Tex-Mex items in the $6.95 to $8.95 range. Portions of the casual fare are uniformly generous, providing considerable value for budget-watchers.</p>
        <p>The wine list is small, fairly priced and carries some unusual choices from Spain, Chile, California and Australia; the weekend bar scene is a lively one. Major credit cards are accepted and there is street-level access.</p>
