        <p>It's greed time in the nation's capital. Congressional Democrats, grateful for years of generous campaign giving by Federal and postal union political action committees -- and eager for more help in the future -- are about to relax Hatch Act restrictions on "active" partisan political activity by Federal employees.</p>
        <p>From the public's standpoint and that of Federal workers who would face pressures to give money and time to partisan causes, it's a bad idea. But the House approved a bill in March, and President Clinton says he will sign any Hatch Act revision that Congress serves up. Thus, some weakening of the 1939 act seems inevitable this year.</p>

        <p>It's greed time in the nation's capital. Congressional Democrats, grateful for years of generous campaign giving by Federal and postal union political action committees -- and eager for more help in the future -- are about to relax Hatch Act restrictions on "active" partisan political activity by Federal employees.</p>
        <p>From the public's standpoint and that of Federal workers who would face pressures to give money and time to partisan causes, it's a bad idea. But the House approved a bill in March, and President Clinton says he will sign any Hatch Act revision that Congress serves up. Thus, some weakening of the 1939 act seems inevitable this year.</p>
        <p>The extent of the overhaul is now squarely before the Senate. The Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, and his Democratic colleagues can show character by accepting a reasonable Republican proposal that would maintain current Hatch Act restrictions for the most sensitive Government posts and agencies, and keep all Federal employees out of the political fund-raising game.</p>
        <p>Critics of the Hatch Act complain that it stifles the political rights of Federal employees. But even "Hatched" workers can vote, make political contributions and participate in their off hours in nonpartisan political activities. While some of the rules are needlessly complex, the remaining curbs on partisan activity, designed to protect the public from a politically tainted Civil Service, have been upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>Unlike the aggressively misguided revision rushed through the House in March, the measure proposed in the Senate by John Glenn, Democrat of Ohio, would still prohibit Federal employees from running for partisan elected office and soliciting political contributions from the public. However, like a similar measure wisely vetoed in 1990 by President Bush, the Glenn bill would allow civil servants to serve after working hours as active party and campaign workers and, more troubling, to solicit co-workers for contributions to their unions' PAC's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glenn provides penalties for coercion, but they are inadequate to protect Federal employees, who can now turn aside political overtures by saying, "Sorry, I'm Hatched."</p>
        <p>The Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, and Senator William Roth, Republican of Delaware, have now proposed a reasonable compromise. Their amendment would exempt from the proposed relaxation on partisan politicking high-ranking career employees across Government who work closely with political appointees. It would also exclude the intelligence services and other sensitive agencies like the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service, where maintaining the perception and reality of nonpartisanship is crucial. All Federal employees would be barred from soliciting, accepting or receiving political contributions.</p>
        <p>For now, Senate Democrats seem determined to get Federal civil servants in the business of hustling political contributions from their co-workers. That makes it plainer than ever: The Democrats' biggest concern here isn't free speech or good government but political money and influence.</p>
