        <p>Cases handled by one judge in Manhattan's main criminal trial court are overturned on appeal twice as often as those of any of his colleagues, and appellate courts consistently blame mistakes made by the judge.</p>
        <p>In the most recent setback for the judge, Acting Justice Jerome Hornblass of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, the Appellate Division of Supreme Court this month granted a new trial to a man convicted of attempted aggravated assault for aiming a machine gun at police officers. The appeals court ruled that Justice Hornblass made no fewer than seven errors in the case, any one of which would have been grounds for retrial.</p>
        <p>A review of the judge's cases in recent years shows that since February 1990 appeals courts have thrown out the results of 24 cases he heard, all for errors made by the judge. This is by far the highest figure among the 50 judges who hear felony cases in Manhattan. The next highest is 10 reversals in the same period, for Acting Justice Edward J. McLaughlin and for Justice Clifford A. Scott, some of which the appeals courts did not blame on the judges. Most justices have three reversals or fewer. 16 Cases Overturned</p>
        <p>In the years 1989, 1990 and 1991, Justice Hornblass presided over 81 completed trials. The verdicts in sixteen of those cases -- nearly one in five -- have been overturned, and some may still be on appeal.</p>
        <p>Holly Maguigan, a law professor at New York University and an expert in criminal procedure, said, "People should be very upset about this sort of thing." The reversal rate nationwide for the most serious felonies is 8.5 percent, she said.</p>
        <p>"A 20-percent reversal rate is way out of line," Professor Maguigan said.</p>
        <p>The consensus among lawyers who have dealt with Justice Hornblass is that his mistakes stem not from bad motives but from sloppiness and a tendency to ramble, stepping unintentionally into legal minefields.</p>
        <p>In several of its rulings, the Appellate Division of Supreme Court has stated that while the evidence against the defendants was overwhelming, it had no choice but to grant them costly and time-consuming retrials because of missteps by Justice Hornblass.</p>
        <p>Justice Hornblass, 52, refused to defend his actions in any particular case or his record as a whole. "I don't feel it's proper for me, as a judge, to be quoted," he said in a telephone interview from Hong Kong, where he is vacationing. Improper Instructions</p>
        <p>In reversing the case of Carl Pegeise, convicted in the machine-gun case, the appeals court wrote that among other mistakes, the judge improperly urged jurors "to evaluate the religious ardor displayed by the witnesses in taking the oath."</p>
        <p>On June 27, 1990, as the trial wound down, the judge reminded the jury that the witnesses had sworn to tell the truth. "The Bible, they swore on the Bible," he said. "What impact did that have? Some people, they could place their hand on a stack of cartoon books and it has the same impact as placing their hand on the Bible."</p>
        <p>Several trial lawyers -- nearly all of whom refused to let their names be used in discussing a judge who could decide their future cases -- described Justice Hornblass as a good person and a well-intentioned judge, but they also questioned his abilities. One said, "He consistently does and says very strange things."</p>
        <p>Richard Emery, one of the few trial lawyers who would speak for the record, said, "If he makes mistakes, they are mistakes of the best intention, and perhaps a degree of naivete." Prejudices Case</p>
        <p>As in the Pegeise case, Justice Hornblass has often gotten into trouble with instructions to juries, particularly the routine warning that a decision not to testify must not be held against a defendant. The Appellate Division has ruled repeatedly that in discussing the issue at length, he draws undue attention to it and prejudices the case against the defendant.</p>
        <p>In the Pegeise case, the appellate court also found that in telling jurors that police officers are not necessarily more believable than others, he turned the instruction on its head.</p>
        <p>"The charge to that jury was designed to get a conviction," said Kenneth Finkelman, the Legal Aid lawyer who argued Mr. Pegeise's appeal. "I was appalled. I've never seen anything like it."</p>
        <p>To Ms. Maguigan, the N.Y.U. professor, the tendency to make the same errors repeatedly, especially once they have been cited by the Appellate Division, is alarming. "It starts to look like he's defying the appellate court," she said.</p>
        <p>A former prosecutor, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that prosecutors are no happier with the judge than are defense lawyers, because his mistakes can undo hard-won victories. In 20 of the judge's 24 reversals since early 1990, courts overturned convictions and ordered new trials. In the other four cases, he had invoked a judge's rarely used power to set aside a jury's guilty verdict, only to have the appellate court overrule him.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, and prosecutors in his office refused to discuss Justice Hornblass's performance. Appointed Position</p>
        <p>The State Supreme Court bench is made up of justices, who are elected, and acting justices, like Justice Hornblass, essentially on indefinite loan from other courts. The Chief Administrative Judge of New York State appoints acting justices and can revoke the designation, sending judges back to their previous courts.</p>
        <p>Ivy Miller, a spokeswoman for the state court system, said the Chief Administrative Judge typically reviews the appointments annually. She did not know if that had been the case with Justice Hornblass, an acting justice since 1982. The current Chief Administrative Judge, E. Leo Milonas, took office on July 1 and has not reviewed Justice Hornblass's status.</p>
        <p>A graduate of Yeshiva University and Brooklyn Law School, Justice Hornblass served for three years as the City Commissioner of Addiction Services under Mayor Abraham D. Beame.</p>
        <p>In 1977, Mayor Beame appointed him to the Criminal Court, which handles misdemeanors and some procedural matters in felony cases. He was reappointed in 1986 by Mayor Edward I. Koch for a 10-year term, and for its duration can be removed only for misconduct or disability. In each case, the City Bar Association rated him qualified for the job.</p>
        <p>Until 1990, the judge had an unremarkable record on appeal, with about one reversal a year. A lawyer who knows him said that the situation changed when the judge became convinced that the standard terse instructions to a jury meant nothing to most people and decided to ad lib. The judge believes in the intent of the instructions, the lawyer said, but frequently subverts them with his verbal meanderings. Other Errors</p>
        <p>But improper jury instructions account for just six of the 24 reversals. The judge has had convictions overturned for a variety of reasons, including improper dismissal of jurors and refusing to allow evidence that the only witness to a crime had a history of mental illness.</p>
        <p>A lawyer who has tried cases before Justice Hornblass said his appeal record worsened because lawyers and the appellate courts learned of previous problems and began to look more closely at his cases.</p>
        <p>Justice Hornblass has an unusual background for a judge -- he is an ordained rabbi and an adjunct professor of sociology at City University -- and he has long been known as an unusual figure on the bench. In the early 1980's, he became known for offering counseling to defendants who he thought could be saved from lives of crime. He once visited Rikers Island to see whether his court order to protect an inmate from sexual assault being adhered to.</p>
