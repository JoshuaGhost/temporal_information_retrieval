        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>While I believe the Sunday, June 27 article ("The Cake Of Cakes") by Florence Fabricant was done in good humor, the net effect was to do me a disservice.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fabricant referred to me as "Sylvia Weinstock, the grand dame of Manahattan bakers" and went on to name other cake people as having "acquired a following among people who are intimidated by Ms. Weinstock's prices." The clear implication being that my cakes are exorbitantly priced and out of the range of all but the wealthy.</p>
        <p>The wedding cake is one of the most significant and memorable items of the celebration. It is also one of the least costly essentials of the reception. However, cost cutting in the wrong place can have woeful effects. The cost of my cakes is not intimidating or exorbitant. My business would be defunct if I depended only on the celebrities and the wealthy. I am here to serve all people of good taste and discretion who want the best and most beautiful cake for their very special occasions. SYLVIA WEINSTOCK  New York</p>
