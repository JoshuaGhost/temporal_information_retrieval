        <p>While I readily acknowledge the historical fact of the objectification of women, I do not agree with Deborah Tannen's rather dated diagnosis of women as punitively "marked" by the superficialities of clothing and cosmetics ("Wears Jump Suit. Sensible Shoes. Uses Husband's Last Name," June 20).</p>
        <p>In 1993, the belief that women are trapped at the extremes -- sluttish or dowdy, frilly or butch, too young or too old -- reflects neither women's progress in the mainstream nor the increased diversity of that mainstream, which has deadened the shock of a lipstick too red, a hemline too high or a boss's name preceded by "Ms." (as all of mine have been). By categorizing her colleagues according to haircut, eye shade and shoe style, Tannen is proving that objectification is no longer a strictly male offense. She is promoting the excessive self-criticism and exacerbating the low self-esteem that are increasingly making women their own worst enemies, and, in the process, she is revealing women's silent partnership in the business of sexual harassment.
