        <p>Always, there has been Jimmy Key this season. Through losing streaks and bullpen disasters, through successful skeins and talk of a pennant, Key has been there for the Yankees. Unchanged. Unflappable. Unemotional. Almost unbeatable.</p>
        <p>Key was there for the Yankees again last night in his usual unruffled form, and for a change, he did not have to be so precise on the mound. That's because several teammates vented their frustration against the Oakland Athletics and helped boost the Yankees to a 10-3 victory at Yankee Stadium. The offensive eruption allowed the Yankees to snap a four-game losing streak against the A's, and it partly obscured more marvelous pitching by Key.</p>

        <p>Always, there has been Jimmy Key this season. Through losing streaks and bullpen disasters, through successful skeins and talk of a pennant, Key has been there for the Yankees. Unchanged. Unflappable. Unemotional. Almost unbeatable.</p>
        <p>Key was there for the Yankees again last night in his usual unruffled form, and for a change, he did not have to be so precise on the mound. That's because several teammates vented their frustration against the Oakland Athletics and helped boost the Yankees to a 10-3 victory at Yankee Stadium. The offensive eruption allowed the Yankees to snap a four-game losing streak against the A's, and it partly obscured more marvelous pitching by Key.</p>
        <p>"He's our man," said Danny Tartabull. "He's been our man all year."</p>
        <p>Manager Buck Showalter did not know whose hand to shake first after Key had tied a career-best with his eighth straight victory and the Yankees had crushed Oakland for 17 hits. There was Bernie Williams embracing his new place as sixth in the lineup by driving in three runs and stealing two bases in a game for the first time in his career, even though one was ill-advised because it occurred with the Yankees leading, 8-1.</p>
        <p>There were Tartabull and Paul O'Neill with three hits apiece, including back-to-back homers off Kelly Downs in the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>There was Don Mattingly poking two run-scoring hits to increase his hitting streak to 11 games and the new leadoff man Wade Boggs collecting three hits and scoring twice. On and on the Yankees bashed.</p>
        <p>Maybe they were trying to eliminate the sick feeling that had built up inside after they lost eight of 10 games before the All-Star Game break, that same queasy feeling that returned when they lost the first game of the series to Oakland, 8-3, on Thursday in a typically ugly manner. If the Yankees wanted to resuscitate themselves, Key helped them by improving his record to a gaudy 12-2 and moving them to within one game of first-place Toronto. Homers by the Hendersons</p>
        <p>Key was touched for homers by Rickey Henderson and Dave Henderson, but it really did not matter because the Yankees drilled four pitchers in winning for the 15th time in their last 18 games at the Stadium. Other than the homers, Key stifled the A's on three other measly hits while lasting seven innings. His major league-leading earned run average inched up from 2.31 to 2.32.</p>
        <p>If the bullpen had not mishandled three four-run leads in games Key left, he could be 15-2 and have his name already engraved on the Cy Young Award. Where would they be without him?</p>
        <p>"I haven't seen anyone equal what he's done in a long time," said the pitching coach, Tony Cloninger. "In spring training, you could see he was a man on a mission."</p>
        <p>Since Showalter has become accustomed to Key sparkling, he might have been more thrilled that Boggs and Williams appeared rejuvenated and Tartabull and Mattingly continued to sizzle. Before going 3 for 5, Boggs had been hitless in 29 of his last 33 at-bats. Williams, the man Boggs replaced in the leadoff spot, was 8 for his last 50 and had stolen only one base entering last night's game. But he had three hits, drove in three and pushed his stolen base total to three.</p>
        <p>On the flipside, Mattingly is 35 for 91 with 13 r.b.i. in 22 games, and Tartabull is 32 for 90 with 19 r.b.i. in 22 games.</p>
        <p>Actually, Showalter was probably just happy that the sluggish Yankees had stayed close to the Blue Jays for another night.</p>
        <p>"The best thing was the win and getting production from a lot of different people," Showalter said. "I wouldn't go farther than that." INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>How concerned are the Yankees about pitching? GEORGE STEINBRENNER met with General Manager GENE MICHAEL; Manager BUCK SHOWALTER; the assistant general manager, WILLIE RANDOLPH; the pitching coach, TONY CLONINGER, and the bullpen coach, MARK CONNOR, until the wee hours of the morning after Thursday's loss to the A's. . . . Second baseman PAT KELLY's left thigh bruise is not considered serious and he might start Sunday. Outfielder DANNY TARTABULL played with a strained right shoulder that may limit him to d.h. duties for a while. . . . Infielder-outfielder RANDY VELARDE (fractured pelvis) is expected back Aug. 1. . . . Last night's attendance of 32,125 put the Yankees at 1,011,343 for the season.</p>
