        <p>The disagreement between the Roundabout Theater and its tenant, the American Jewish Theater, over occupancy of the Susan Bloch Theater in Chelsea escalated dramatically yesterday. By the end of the day, both groups were locked out of the space.</p>
        <p>The Roundabout's general manager, Ellen Richard, and several theater employees entered the 120-seat theater at 307 West 26th Street at 7 A.M. and took possession of the files, telephones, computers and financial records of the American Jewish Theater, which has rented the space for the last five years. (The Roundabout says it wants to use the space itself.) Keys Offered and Refused</p>
        <p>The locks were changed and the files were moved to a storage locker in Manhattan. The locker keys were offered to Stanley Brechner, the American Jewish Theater's artistic director, who refused to accept them and called the police.</p>
        <p>"They have illegally taken property from our premises and we intend to press charges," said Mr. Brechner. "The American Jewish Theater is now homeless." He said the theater, which has 2,500 subscribers, did not even have access to its checks and bank statements.</p>
        <p>Ms. Richard of the Roundabout, which has more than 23,000 subscribers and an annual budget of $5 million, said, "Our lawyers served Mr. Brechner with all the proper notices, and we had every right to get our space back." The American Jewish Theater's annual budget is $375,000.  Actually a Sublet</p>
        <p>The Jewish theater group is actually a subtenant; the Roundabout rents the space from Mutual Redevelopment Houses, a middle-income nonprofit cooperative that stretches from 23d to 29th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues. Leonard Piekarsky, general manager for Redevelopment Houses, said he had taken possession of the keys to the theater "and neither theater company now has access to the space."</p>
        <p>He added: "I won't release the keys to either group until there is a court order, or they both come to an agreement." He said that a meeting of the parties was scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The American Jewish Theater said in June that it had been asked by the Roundabout to leave the Bloch Theater. It declined, and the dispute was in the hands of lawyers until yesterday.  A Heady Season</p>
        <p>At that time, Mr. Brechner lamented the "David and Goliath" situation and accused the Roundabout of being a heartless landlord. The Roundabout, which has had a heady season of critical acclaim for its productions of "Anna Christie," "The Price" and "She Loves Me," blamed Mr. Brechner for causing the problem.</p>
        <p>The cramped, creaky-floored Susan Bloch is far from perfect, but audiences had found it habit-forming through the years. Among the Jewish Theater's 20 productions there were "The Rothschilds," "I Can Get It for You Wholesale" and "Another Time."</p>
        <p>The Roundabout once occupied the Bloch as well, and both companies have claimed credit for revitalizing it.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Brechner also charged that the Roundabout "rifled through our records, broke into back offices, tampered with our personal stuff and with the money that was there," he said. "They ripped pictures off the walls and kicked around our papers on the floor. They also destroyed our display of pictures and articles on anti-Semitism. It was a storm-trooperlike action."</p>
        <p>Mr. Brechner said he had not accepted the locker key "because after their presumptuousness and arrogance in committing an unlawful act, why should we accept it when they say, 'Here's the key to your stuff'?"</p>
        <p>Ms. Richard denied that the anti-Semitism exhibit had been destroyed, and said the storm-trooper allegation was "ridiculous, since the Roundabout's founder and artistic director are both Jewish."</p>
        <p>She added: "We are contractually entitled to the space. We want to use the space. It's ours, and our agreement is terminated."</p>
