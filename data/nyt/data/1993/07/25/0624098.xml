        <p>In a three-hole burst culminating with an eagle 3, Helen Alfredsson of Sweden seized the lead in the 48th United States Women's Open today, taking a two-stroke advantage into Sunday's final round.</p>
        <p>The 28-year-old Alfredsson shot a three-under-par 69 over the Crooked Stick Golf Course for a 54-hole total of nine-under 207, a record for three rounds in the Open.

        <p>In a three-hole burst culminating with an eagle 3, Helen Alfredsson of Sweden seized the lead in the 48th United States Women's Open today, taking a two-stroke advantage into Sunday's final round.</p>
        <p>The 28-year-old Alfredsson shot a three-under-par 69 over the Crooked Stick Golf Course for a 54-hole total of nine-under 207, a record for three rounds in the Open. Her closest pursuer is Hiromi Kobayashi of Japan, who managed a 71 despite nearly becoming ill in the middle of her round.</p>
        <p>Three behind at 210 are Donna Andrews, who had a 69, and the veteran Pat Bradley, whose 68 was the low round of the day.  Three Birdies in a Row</p>
        <p>The 42-year-old Bradley had three birdies in a row starting at the eighth hole and then closed with a 3 on the 18th, where she hit a 6-iron out of the left rough within 4 feet.</p>
        <p>Although Bradley has 30 career titles, her performance this week has come from out of nowhere. Her last victory came in 1991, and in the last year, she has had only two finishes better than 10th.</p>
        <p>"I'm thrilled with the round," said Bradley.</p>
        <p>Nancy Lopez, still looking for her first victory in this championship, Dina Ammaccapane and Ayako Okamoto of Japan are at 211. McGann Diagnoses Collapse</p>
        <p>All the leaders were the beneficiaries of an early collapse by the second-round leader Michelle McGann, who bogeyed the first four holes and double-bogeyed the eighth on her way to a 78 that dropped her seven strokes behind Alfredsson.</p>
        <p>The 23-year-old McGann, who is a diabetic, said after the round that she began it feeling weak and lethargic, possibly because her blood sugar was depleted from the extra adrenaline her body was using from the demands of leading the championship.</p>
        <p>On the first four holes, McGann missed each of her approaches to the left, failing to move her lower body aggressively through her swing.</p>
        <p>"It was a matter of my legs," said McGann, who had told her father and caddie, Bucky McGann, that she was having trouble feeling her lower body at the beginning of the round. "I was lazy, and just that little bit threw my swing off. It's hard to blame it on a health problem. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't." An Eagle on the Ninth</p>
        <p>By the time McGann double-bogeyed the eighth hole, Alfredsson, playing one hole ahead, was seizing the moment. After a bogey on the par-3 sixth hole, she hit a wedge to 5 feet on the 370-yard par-4 seventh and made the putt. On the 349-yard eighth, an 8-iron approach expired 11 feet away, leading to another birdie. Finally, on the 435-yard par-5 ninth, Alfredsson hit a 4-iron from 185 yards to 5 feet and holed the putt for an eagle.</p>
        <p>It put her 10 under for the tournament, and 3 strokes ahead of Kobayashi. Alfredsson maintained that edge until she bunkered her approach at the 400-yard par-4 18th and missed a 10-foot putt for par.</p>
        <p>Despite the bogey, Alfredsson's total of 207 broke by one stroke the former 54-hole low for the championship set by Amy Alcott in 1980 and Liselotte Neumann in 1988. Alfredsson attributed her low scoring, fueled by 16 birdies and an eagle in the first 54 holes, in large part to the straightforwardness of Crooked Stick.</p>
        <p>"I couldn't imagine making all these birdies in an Open, but it is such a fair golf course," said Alfredsson. "If you hit a good shot by the pin, it stays there."</p>
        <p>Alfredsson is a tough competitor who proved her mettle earlier this year in winning another major championship, the Nabisco Dinah Shore. That was a steeling experience for Alfredsson, who has learned how to vent her frustrations but regain her poise in time for the next shot.</p>
        <p>"It's just a matter of patience," said Alfredsson. "The worst is trying to force things. That doesn't work."</p>
        <p>But with Crooked Stick's soft greens accessible to a hot round, Alfredsson will have a lot to contend with if she can't manage one of her own on Sunday. Her chief threat is Kobayashi, who last week won her first L.P.G.A. title, the JAL Big Apple Classic, in New Rochelle.</p>
        <p>She did it by outplaying the veteran Betsy King on the final day to win by four shots. But to do something similar in the final round of the Open, Kobayashi will have to put a rein on what was almost a runaway case of nerves that afflicted her in the third round. After the 13th hole, she said she became sick to her stomach.</p>
        <p>"Too much nervous today," said the 30-year-old resident of Ibaraki, Japan.</p>
