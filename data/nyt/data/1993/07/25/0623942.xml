        <p>Henry L. Jamieson, chairman of the Franklin Group of Funds in San Mateo, Calif., who was in the mutual fund business from its early days, died on Tuesday at his home in Menlo Park, Calif. He was 81.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, his company said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamieson began his career in 1934 selling investments for Investor Diversified Services. While there, he graduated from Washington University in 1936. He served as a personnel officer in the Navy in World War II, reaching the rank of lieutenant commander, and returned to Investor Diversified Services as a divisional manager in 1948.</p>
        <p>Five years later, he opened his own concern, H. L. Jamieson &amp; Company, in San Francisco, which later merged with an East Coast firm, the Channing Corporation. After a period as assistant chairman of the Trust Securities Corporation of Boston, he became president of Winfield &amp; Company in San Francisco in 1967.</p>
        <p>In 1973 he negotiated a merger with Franklin Resources, which moved its headquarters to San Mateo from New York City. He was chairman of Franklin Resources from then until 1980, when he assumed the same position in the Franklin Group of Funds, the parent company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jamieson is survived by his wife of 57 years, Georgia; two daughters, Caroline Hagopian of Burlingame, Calif., and Susannah Rothman of Camp Hill, Pa.; a son, Edward, of Hillsborough, Calif., and seven grandchildren.</p>
