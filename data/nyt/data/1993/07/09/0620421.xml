        <p>Kenneth Schanzer yesterday was named president of Major League Baseball's recently formed joint venture to broadcast games on network television with NBC and ABC . He is faced with the task of changing advertiser and viewer attitudes toward the sport, which has suffered as baseball's network ratings have fallen.</p>
        <p>"The overall job is very daunting," said Mr. Schanzer, who is leaving his position as executive vice president of NBC Sports. "Despite all the talk about the problems baseball has, one thing that can't be denied by anybody is baseball is a sport with enormous root strength."</p>

        <p>Kenneth Schanzer yesterday was named president of Major League Baseball's recently formed joint venture to broadcast games on network television with NBC and ABC . He is faced with the task of changing advertiser and viewer attitudes toward the sport, which has suffered as baseball's network ratings have fallen.</p>
        <p>"The overall job is very daunting," said Mr. Schanzer, who is leaving his position as executive vice president of NBC Sports. "Despite all the talk about the problems baseball has, one thing that can't be denied by anybody is baseball is a sport with enormous root strength."</p>
        <p>The joint venture, which will take control of network baseball after CBS's $1.06 billion deal ends this season, will change how the sport is sold and viewed. ABC and NBC are paying no money but will share advertising and sponsorship revenues with baseball.</p>
        <p>Gone will be nationally broadcast Saturday afternoon games, replaced by 12 weeks of prime-time games shown regionally. All league championship games will shift from being available to the whole country to being broadcast on a regional basis. Only the World Series will continue to be broadcast nationally.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schanzer's most immediate goal is to hire a sales chief and create a sales organization for the venture, which will sell network advertising and corporate sponsorships, two elements that had never been combined.</p>
        <p>"We have a blank page here," said Mr. Schanzer, who will also have a separate position within baseball in charge of broadcasting, cable, radio and international television. "This is an opportunity to get in on the ground floor of an enormously exciting venture."  THE MEDIA BUSINESS</p>
