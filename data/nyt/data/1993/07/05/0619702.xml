        <p>With gasoline cheap and plentiful, and expected to stay that way through the summer, Americans who put off trips during the economic doldrums of the last few years are hitting the road again.</p>
        <p>The American Automobile Association, based on a survey of 1,500 drivers, predicted last week that travel during the Fourth of July weekend would be up 4 percent from the holiday weekend in 1992, with 30 million Americans planning to make trips of 100 miles or more.</p>

        <p>With gasoline cheap and plentiful, and expected to stay that way through the summer, Americans who put off trips during the economic doldrums of the last few years are hitting the road again.</p>
        <p>The American Automobile Association, based on a survey of 1,500 drivers, predicted last week that travel during the Fourth of July weekend would be up 4 percent from the holiday weekend in 1992, with 30 million Americans planning to make trips of 100 miles or more.</p>
        <p>Most will pump their own gas at self-serve stations and hunt for bargains at motels. Few said they were worried about the prospect of a gas tax of 4 cents to 5 cents a gallon, which seems likely if the tax bill now before Congress is passed.</p>
        <p>Indeed, driving is widely seen as economical, compared with flying.  The discount fares offered by the airlines are not as steep as they were during a fare war last summer, when ticket prices were slashed by as much as 50 percent. As a result, the number of people traveling by airplane is expected to decline 8 percent from 1992, the survey said.</p>
        <p>"There is a new breed of traveler," said Jerry Cheske, the director of public relations for the automobile association. "They shop for vacations much like they shop for a TV or stereo."</p>
        <p>Among those who are opting to travel by car is Bill Gardner. He paused a couple of days ago with his wife, Trina, and their three children at a service area on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, while en route to Ocean City, N.J., for a family reunion. They live in Western Springs, Ill., a Chicago suburb.</p>
        <p>"It's a lot cheaper than going by plane," he said of the two-day trip in his Plymouth Voyager. The cost of gas is lower than in past years, he has found, and there are bargains at many of the motel chains along the way -- several had rates of $38 for a room, breakfast included.</p>
        <p>Perhaps as a result, the automobile association survey found that more people planned to stay in motels this year: 43 percent, up from 37 percent a year ago. Only a quarter said they planned to stay with relatives, down from a third last year.</p>
        <p>Few drivers seemed worried about the growing dependence of the United States on foreign oil, which is at an all-time high. About half the oil consumed in the United States in recent months has been from foreign sources. Use of Imported Oil Up</p>
        <p>The dependence on imported oil has jumped this year, with consumption of foreign oil up 7.2 percent in May over the corresponding month last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group based in Washington. Of total consumption of 17.1 million barrels a day, imports made up an average of 8.4 million barrels in May. Imports accounted for 49.1 percent of the oil consumed in May, up from 47.6 percent in May of last year.</p>
        <p>Many motorists interviewed said that obeying the 55-mile-per-hour speed limit would be dangerous because the general flow of traffic is faster. Faster speeds mean greater gasoline consumption, and greater fuel costs.</p>
        <p>Despite consuming extra gas at the faster speeds, motorists still look for bargains when they can find them. And bargains abound, enough of them to more than offset the costs of the proposed gasoline tax.</p>
        <p>Nationally, the average price for self-serve regular unleaded gas was $1.12 a gallon last week, down 6.1 cents from a year ago, according to the automobile association. The average price of a gallon of gas in New York State was 5 cents less than it was a year ago, despite a 3-cent rise over the last two months because of high demand.</p>
        <p>Prices are approaching the low levels that prevailed before the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990. After that they took a huge jump. Recession and higher gas prices kept many travelers at home for the Fourth of July weekend in 1991.</p>
        <p>One effect of lower gasoline prices seems to be a return to the free-wheeling speeds of earlier years. Mr. Gardner, like most motorists, said he no longer observed the 55 m.p.h. limit, even though there are reminders everywhere, like the signs in Pennsylvania that emphasize the speed limit is "still 55."</p>
        <p>Mr. Gardner said the speed limit was unsafe because the general flow of traffic is 60 to 65 m.p.h. and there are the risks of being tailgated by impatient drivers.</p>
        <p>Indeed, during a recent drive on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, a steady stream of cars traveling 60 to 65 m.p.h. passed several speed traps without any offenders being stopped.</p>
        <p>Tom Culpepper, the manager of safety for the automobile association, said most states had adopted a 65 m.p.h. limit on roads in rural areas, an option allowed by Congress, which adopted the 55 m.p.h. limit to conserve gas during the early 1970's.</p>
        <p>A side effect of the lower speed limit was a drop in the rate and severity of collisions, resulting in a decline in highway deaths and injuries for a time. But as gas prices have fallen, the average speed has been rising. Most drivers travel about 65 to 70 m.p.h. on the Interstate highways, Mr. Culpepper said. He said studies have differed on whether the higher speeds had led to an increase in deaths and injuries.</p>
        <p>"The motoring public has decided that 55 miles an hour is not a reasonable speed," Mr. Culpepper added. "Historically the public has always responded to unreasonable highway traffic control by simply ignoring it."</p>
        <p>Many drivers also appeared to ignore the anticipated bite of the proposed gas tax. Trilby Lundberg, the publisher of the Lundberg Newsletter, which covers the gasoline industry, said the impact of the tax on gas may have little effect at the pump.</p>
        <p>Indeed, most drivers said in interviews that they were not worried about the proposed tax. Adding a few cents to the tax, Ms. Lundberg said, would not prove very costly for most Americans -- about $30 to $40 a year for the average family. Demand for Gasoline Up</p>
        <p>Demand for gasoline has risen as drivers in some parts of the country have begun to shake off the recession. Gas sales were up 2 percent last year from the year before, and in May sales were up 1.2 percent over May of last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute.</p>
        <p>Drivers kept costs down during the recession by using cheaper, lower grades of gasoline and pumping it themselves. About 95 percent of the gas sold now is at self-serve pumps.</p>
        <p>The effects of the recession, however, have kept some families cautious. At the Thomas A. Edison rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike a couple of days ago, Gerald Goodlin, an auto parts salesman from Bellmore, L.I., said his family would like to make a trip to Florida later this summer but were reluctant because of the cost.</p>
        <p>Other drivers had planned their trips far ahead and were determined to make long trips anyway.</p>
        <p>Frank McCormack, a Canadian whose motor home was packed with his wife, June, their three children and his mother-in-law, Bertha, had started a vacation from their home on Prince Edward Island and had stopped in New York. Their destination is Vancouver, British Columbia, but they had decided to go the long way around, by way of Nashville.</p>
        <p>"We've always wanted to see the States," Mr. McCormack said while getting gas at a rest stop on the New Jersey Turnpike. He said he had been pleasantly surprised by the low gas prices in the United States compared with those in Canada -- which are roughly $2 a gallon -- especially since his mobile home got about 12 miles to the gallon.</p>
        <p>Which route did they plan to follow after they visit Nashville? "We're just going to go down the highway," he said with a gleam in his eye.</p>
