        <p>Faculty leaders from most campuses of the City University of New York yesterday passed a strongly worded resolution condemning the university's Chancellor, Dr. W. Ann Reynolds, faculty representatives said.</p>
        <p>However the representatives, who say they feel betrayed by the Chancellor's decision to provide discretionary funds only to those colleges that have cooperated with her efforts to consolidate the university's programs, refused to disclose the content of the resolution until it is delivered to Dr. Reynolds today.</p>
        <p>"I think the feeling at the meeting was that we should treat her better than she has treated us," said Dr. Kenneth P. Sherrill, chairman of the Hunter College Senate, as he left the three-hour meeting, held at the University's Graduate Center at 33 West 42d Street.</p>
        <p>Last night, sources familiar with the resolution said it referred to Dr. Reynolds's "duplicity" and said she had suffered "a complete loss of credibility." Faculty sources said it left a door open, calling on the Chancellor to engage in good-faith talks with faculty representatives. Unusual Summer Meeting</p>
        <p>While such a faculty group does not have the power to remove the Chancellor, faculty senates do control curriculum and other academic matters, like graduation requirements and the conferring of honorary degrees, and could thwart Dr. Reynolds's plans for reorganization. In addition, campus leaders said after the meeting that it was likely that after the start of the fall term, faculty members would seek votes of no confidence in Dr. Reynolds, which could endanger her ability to lead the university.</p>
        <p>The unusual summer meeting of the faculty was attended by the steering committee of the University Faculty Senate and 16 leaders of the individual campus senates. The campus senates make up the governing bodies of the 21 individual campuses and have wide powers over curriculum and other academic matters.</p>
        <p>Demonstrating that she took the meeting seriously, Dr. Reynolds dispatched a delegation consisting of Deputy Chancellor Laurence F. Mucciolo, two vice chancellors and the university dean for academic affairs to address the group. The four university officials answered questions during the first part of the meeting but were not allowed to stay during the faculty group's deliberations.</p>
        <p>After the meeting, Jay Hershenson, the university's vice chancellor for university relations, declined to comment on the contents of the resolution until he saw it. However, he said, university officials were "very eager to work positively with the University Faculty Senate and the college governance bodies."</p>
        <p>The increasingly bitter battle over reorganization began last December when Dr. Reynolds unveiled a plan for eliminating about 200 of the system's baccalaureate and associate degree programs with small enrollments. Dr. Reynolds said the move was necessary to maintain the vitality of a university facing budget problems.</p>
        <p>However, the move was vehemently opposed by faculty members, students and legislators who thought it infringed on the autonomy of the colleges and would weaken liberal arts programs and many schools.</p>
        <p>As a result, last month the Chancellor offered a more modest plan, which was adopted by the university's trustees. The plan called for all the colleges to periodically review their academic programs. Programs not meeting guidelines, to be drawn up by Dr. Reynolds, would be subject to elimination.</p>
        <p>The battle intensified again 10 days ago as a result of the disclosure of an internal university memo that was provided to a reporter by opponents critical of the reorganization plan. The memo, distributed by Dr. Reynolds to key university officials, said the university's central office would divide up to $15 million in additional financing among campuses that had reacted favorably to the initial plan but would withhold the extra money from campuses that had not done so.</p>
        <p>In one instance, the memo suggested additional financing to the College of Staten Island would be withheld until its president, Dr. Edmond L. Volpe, resigned.</p>
