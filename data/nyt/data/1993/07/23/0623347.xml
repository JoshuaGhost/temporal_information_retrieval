        <p>When he was questioned by state investigators about a lack of coordination between City Hall and the police during the violence in Crown Heights two summers ago, former Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch responded this way: "My position was always, whether that was good or bad, was that we worked different sides of the street."</p>
        <p>Behind the voluminous official state report on Crown Heights, with its finding that a long skein of leadership failures and miscommunications allowed the violence to rage out of hand, city and police officials said yesterday, was a sense of divided responsibility for handling the crisis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch's sense of "different sides of the street" helps explain how Mayor David N. Dinkins and his top aides took the position that they had the 1991 violence under control even as terrified residents pleaded for help, calls deluged the 911 emergency telephone number, and police officers on the street were being forced by the danger to run in retreat back to the precinct station house.</p>
        <p>It was almost as if two separate institutions, with two separate cultures, were responding to the crisis: City Hall, with its corps of aides, human-rights workers and community mediatiors, and the police, a paramilitary bureaucracy that in this case was left paralyzed by a lack of orders from the top. 'Badly Miscalculated'</p>
        <p>"I believe he put his top people in the soft stuff, peer mediation," one city official who has frequent dealings with the Dinkins administration said of the Mayor. "Somewhere in his head I think he assumed he didn't need to be commander in chief, in terms of police and public order, and I think he badly miscalculated that."</p>
        <p>Making matters worse, according to city officials and the state report, was the fact that Mayor Dinkins at City Hall and Commissioner Lee P. Brown at the Police Department were men with similarly disengaged styles of management, delegating heavy decision-making authority to subordinates, and content to rely on their expertise.</p>
        <p>In fact, the state report found that on the question of whether the police presence was sufficient, the Mayor relied -- despite ample evidence to the contrary from news media reports and calls made to aides -- on the assurances of the handpicked Police Commissioner he invariably referred to as "Dr. Lee Patrick Brown." But Mr. Brown, according to the state report, "did not direct, closely oversee or monitor the police response to the disturbance."</p>
        <p>City Council members, borough officials who often have dealings with the Mayor, and even some of his own aides say that none of the findings of miscommunication or the Mayor's overreliance on Mr. Brown surprise them, that Mr. Dinkins still often comes to meetings on city disputes without having had briefings and that he is often caught by surprise by new information offered by aides at such sessions.</p>
        <p>"The normal day to day screw-ups that happen normally don't involve murder and mayhem," said one official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "Normally it gets by, but here the weakness of the organizational structure and people he has around him proved fatal."</p>
        <p>The Mayor's top advisers dispute that the failures of Crown Heights are symptomatic of the Mayor's leadership style and say they were grappling with a traditional quandary for New York City government -- the optimum relationship between the Mayor and the police. 'Right Conclusion'</p>
        <p>"When does the civilian arm of the government assert control over the uniformed arm?" said the Mayor's press secretary, Leland T. Jones. "That's the tension here." The state report, he noted, concluded "that instead of the civilian arm asserting itself in the 48th hour of the incident, you should have asserted it at the 24th hour of the episode. We accept it as the right conclusion. Twenty-twenty hindsight tells you you had to move."</p>
        <p>Throughout his career as a black elected official, Mr. Dinkins has had a sometimes uneasy relationship with the police. As far back as 1984, when he was City Clerk, he called for an investigation into the death of Eleanor Bumpurs, a 66-year-old black woman shot dead in her apartment by police officers when she lunged at them with a knife in an eviction dispute. In the 1989 mayoral race, his Republican opponent, Rudolph W. Giuliani, made a campaign issue of Mr. Dinkins's failure to attend a police funeral in the same week that he addressed inmates at Rikers Island.</p>
        <p>Since Crown Heights, the tension between the Mayor and the police has only worsened, with police officers demonstrating against Mr. Dinkins at City Hall last September, some holding up placards calling the Mayor's "true" color "yellow-bellied" or referring to him as a "washroom attendant." It caused him to speak of the time when as a young law student he was called a "nigger" by a police officer when he parked for a moment in a city bus stop at midnight.</p>
        <p>But several of the Mayor's advisers insist that Mr. Dinkins strongly believes in maintaining law and order and had no qualms about using the police in Crown Heights.</p>
        <p>However, once the Mayor himself failed to aggressively question the judgment of the Police Commissioner, no one else in his administration had the stature to, officials said. His Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, Milton Mollen, told state investigators that an "institutional problem" existed between him and the Police Department from the very first moment he assumed the newly created deputy mayorship. He was viewed, he said, as a meddler in Police Department business.</p>
        <p>With neither the Mayor nor their own Commissioner questioning whether the police were deploying enough officers or using the correct tactics, the rank-and-file police and midlevel officers were left in a vacuum, which was accentuated by staff turnover.</p>
        <p>"Executives also need direction and there was a lack of direction from the top," said Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, who at the time of the disturbances was the First Deputy Commissioner but out of the chain of command for operations. Commissioner Kelly did not cite Mr. Brown by name.</p>
        <p>Where the former Chief of Department, Robert Johnston, might have blanketed Crown Heights with officers, he had recently retired. His successor, David Scott, was on vacation. The next two men in the chain of command were in unfamiliar jobs. The Chief of Detectives, Joseph Borrelli, was functioning as the acting Chief of Department and Mario A. Selvaggi became Chief of Patrol the very day the violence began.</p>
        <p>The result was that Assistant Chief Thomas Gallagher, the commanding officer of the Brooklyn South Patrol Borough, in effect became the policy maker and he chose restraint.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallagher "told us that he commanded the police force according to his personal style," the state report said. "He indicated that unless life and property is clealry in peril, it is preferable to allow the situation to vent itself, rather than fuel it through aggressive police action." 'In his statement to state investigators, Mr. Gallagher noted that when he received no countermanding orders, he thought his superiors had approved his course. Strong Reasons</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallagher did not make himself available for comment in recent days, but other Police Department officials said there were strong reasons why an officer would choose a policy of restraint in the absence of other orders.</p>
        <p>As one put it, "the ghost of Tompkins Square" hovered over the department, with officers still remembering the Manhattan confrontation in 1988 that resulted in more than 100 complaints of police brutality and the disciplining of several officers for bad judgment or excessive force.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly this week also pointed to a news conference by Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Brown in 1991 -- on the day after officers on the street had had to retreat, running back to their precinct house -- that could have been taken as a policy signal to lower-ranking officers.</p>
        <p>At that news conference, the Mayor said he and the Police Commissioner had responded to charges that the police had been overly aggressive in dealing with marches that had escalated into violence. And Commissioner Brown praised the police for showing "great restraint" when rocks and bottles were thrown at them.</p>
        <p>One rank-and-file officer put what happened in military terms: "If you're in a paramilitary organization and you don't get an order to advance and you don't get an order to retreat, what do you do? You hold the line."</p>
