        <p>With the pace of negotiations quickening, the environmental and labor side accords to a North American Free Trade Agreement should be completed by early August, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said here today.</p>
        <p>After meeting with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Mr. Kantor said it was unlikely that the talks with Mexico and Canada could be wrapped up when he meets with the trade ministers of those countries late next week in Washington.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Kantor said the negotiators were still trying to resolve the crucial issue of how to bring sanctions against countries when they fail to punish companies that persistently violate environmental and labor standards.</p>
        <p>"It will be a major part of the discussion on Thursday and Friday," he said of the meetings scheduled for July 29 and 30. Other Issues Involved</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kantor added that the outstanding issues -- which also include the question of how to assure financing for needed environmental, transportation and other projects along the United States-Mexico border -- could probably be sorted out with no more than one or two more meetings.</p>
        <p>Though American officials acknowledge privately that President Clinton conceived the side accords as a means to support the trade agreement drafted under the Bush Administration without alienating environmentalists and organized labor, their negotiation has been far more complex than expected.</p>
        <p>Essentially, American trade officials have been intermediaries between Mexico and Canada on the one hand and a group of mostly Democratic United States legislators on the other.</p>
        <p>The Mexicans and Canadians have sought to limit the power of the supranational commissions to be created under the side accords. Those commissions are to impose trade sanctions in cases where governments or courts do not control the violation of labor and environmental laws. The American legislators want the penalties imposed under a clear timetable, and on the authority of independent, professional commission officials.</p>
        <p>"At the end of the process, there has got to be an effective remedy that assures that national laws are being enforced," the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, said in a speech today in Washington.</p>
