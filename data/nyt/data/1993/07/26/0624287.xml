        <p>EVERYBODY needs a little wisdom now and then, some words to live by.</p>
        <p>They are not the same for everyone, of course, but in a television campaign beginning today for Levi's 501 jeans -- the kind with the button fly -- Levi Strauss &amp; Company offers up eight stylized fortune cookies expressly for young men on the journey out of their teens.</p>
        <p>While the intent may be to sell jeans in their native setting -- worn by a Rollerblader at the beach or a guy pursuing his girl at the carousel in the rain -- within each of three 60-second commercials and five 30-second spots, created by Foote, Cone &amp; Belding of San Francisco, is a pearl of contemporary thought that conveys a sense of optimism and hope from a generation not yet heard from.</p>
        <p>The skater, bouncing around a pier with a hockey stick, says: "Be yourself always. Don't let anyone stop you." A young man walking beneath mountains says: "You've got to go a bit too fast. It builds character."</p>
        <p>Another young man, walking beside an old Rambler as someone drives it slowly down an isolated stretch of road, says, "You've got to make the difference between being alone and feeling lonely." And another character on a Los Angeles street offers: "I think it's good to get away from everything you've known in order to learn something new. But I still haven't found what I'm looking for."</p>
        <p>Maybe it is the attractiveness of each character, the skittish rock-video style of editing or the Aesop's fable mode of presentation. But the commercials have a charming appeal, maybe enough to overwhelm the jeans and the 501 logo flashed at the beginning and end.</p>
        <p>But a more indelible connection seems to be made by use of the words, "Can't Fake It," inserted always haphazardly in the commercials. Can't fake life; can't fake jeans. In that sense, the commercials are more revealing than they first would seem.</p>
        <p>"The seriousness of purpose of people this age is markedly different than five years ago, let alone 10 years ago," said Dan Chew, the manager of corporate marketing for Levi Strauss. "They are concerned, first, about themselves, their families and their future; then, political issues, and all of it driven by the economy."</p>
        <p>How does Levi Strauss know all that? The company constantly tracks its target audience, which means it peeks around the curve to the next generation. The result has been a slow evolution of commercials that try to show the distinctive changes of each new group, but always within the traditional landscape of the top-selling blue jeans in the world.</p>
        <p>For this latest round of 501 commercials, directed by Leslie Dektor, who also directed the "501 Blues" campaign of several years ago, the subjects are talking more than ever before, as a consequence, revealing more of themselves and their generation.</p>
        <p>It took some doing to compress the thoughts into cogent presentations because these commercials, Mr. Chew said, were not scripted in the conventional sense. The young men and women who found their way into the commercials from talent agencies spent long days before the camera, answering questions as they acted out their themes. The best sound bites were preserved and spliced together, giving each spot that MTV generation feel, minus a little of its vacuousness, though one includes bits from a cartoon.</p>
        <p>Still, MTV is one place the commercials will appear into the fall, along with "Beverly Hills 90210," "The Simpsons," prime-time hours on the Fox network and late night programs on other network shows, including reruns on NBC of "Late Night with David Letterman" and "Saturday Night Live."</p>
        <p>As a companion, Levi Strauss is also introducing a radio campaign for 501's, using musical spots of 2 minutes and 60 seconds in which artists were encouraged to write songs that reflected the life style or preferences of those who would wear 501's. Some of the artists are not well known. Some are, although to those beyond the target generation, most of them are likely to be wholly unfamiliar. But maybe they are worth listening to, anyway.</p>
