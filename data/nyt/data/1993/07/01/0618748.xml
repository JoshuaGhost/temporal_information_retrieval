        <p>The Quantum Chemical Corporation, a company that has been down on its luck, got a nice surprise for its shareholders yesterday when it announced that Hanson P.L.C., a prosperous British conglomerate, had agreed to buy it in a $3.2 billion deal whose stock portion is worth $20 a share -- 60 percent more than recent market prices.</p>
        <p>The news lifted Quantum's shares by 52 percent, from $12.50, to $19 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>"The stock opened almost near the offer because there's little risk that the deal will fall through," said John A. Twele, a senior analyst for IDS Financial Services Inc. in Minneapolis, who had coaxed his colleagues into the stock last year. "Hanson has some tremendous financial prowess and capability. So it's not like we have a weak company trying to buy Quantum that has to line up financing. Hanson is like the U.S. Government saying, 'Here's the money.' "  A Tax-Free Transaction</p>
        <p>Under the deal, Hanson will assume $2.5 billion of Quantum's debt and issue $720 million worth of new stock to retire Quantum's 36 million shares. The transaction is tax free to Quantum's shareholders if they hold on to their Hanson stock,</p>
        <p>To put that $3.2 billion number in perspective, Quantum's earnings have sunk five years in a row to the point where the company reported a net loss of $288 million and operating profit of $61 million last year versus a $383 million net profit and $760 million operating profit in 1988.</p>
        <p>Asked why Hanson would be willing to pay 52 times operating profit for a money-losing company with a lot of debt, David H. Clarke, chief executive of Hanson's American arm, said that Hanson was confident the acquisition would be contributing to profits almost immediately.</p>
        <p>He believes Hanson can save at least $125 million of interest costs by refinancing the debt on Quantum's books. Quantum's debt ratings are below investment grade, so it has to pay about 10 percent to borrow money, while Hanson, a much healthier company, can borrow at about 5 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clarke also said that Quantum, which is relocating to Cincinnati from New York, was well poised to deliver superior returns once the market for polyethylene improved because of the $1.6 billion, or $45 a share, that Quantum's management has invested in its plants in the last five years.</p>
        <p>Quantum started off in the whisky business around the Civil War and only expanded seriously into chemicals after World War II. It sold off the liquor portion and changed its name from National Distillers and Chemicals to Quantum in 1987.</p>
        <p>Two year later, the company did a leveraged recapitalization, which involved borrowing to the hilt to pay shareholders a one-time $50 dividend, and pre-empt a takeover artist from getting to the cash first.</p>
        <p>As long as the chemicals business remained healthy, the technique should have worked. However, the stock went into a tailspin when the prices of the company's basic products collapsed.</p>
