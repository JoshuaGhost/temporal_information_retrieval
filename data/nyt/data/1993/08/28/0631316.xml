        <p>As prosecutors argued that Dr. Jack Kevorkian should stand trial under a new state law against assisted suicide, his lawyers moved today to dismiss the charge on the ground that the law is unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>"It's not that we don't want to go to trial," Geoffrey N. Fieger, the doctor's principal lawyer, told reporters today after the opening session of a preliminary hearing in Michigan's 36th District Court. In the past, Mr. Fieger has said he wanted a precedent-setting trial on the issue of assisted suicide, but today he said it was possible "a trial would be more spectacular than important" if the judge did not strike down the law.</p>

        <p>As prosecutors argued that Dr. Jack Kevorkian should stand trial under a new state law against assisted suicide, his lawyers moved today to dismiss the charge on the ground that the law is unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>"It's not that we don't want to go to trial," Geoffrey N. Fieger, the doctor's principal lawyer, told reporters today after the opening session of a preliminary hearing in Michigan's 36th District Court. In the past, Mr. Fieger has said he wanted a precedent-setting trial on the issue of assisted suicide, but today he said it was possible "a trial would be more spectacular than important" if the judge did not strike down the law.</p>
        <p>The law, which was enacted in February specifically because of Dr. Kevorkian's campaign to help terminally ill people kill themselves, was struck down by a county judge in May, but it was reinstated pending a ruling by the Michigan Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p>State District Judge Willy G. Lipscomb Jr. today gave Timothy Kenny, an assistant prosecuting attorney, a week to file a response to the motion. The judge said he would reconvene the hearing on Sept. 9.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kevorkian, a 65-year-old retired pathologist who has helped 17 terminally ill people kill themselves in the last three years, sought a showdown so he could challenge the law in court.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month he told reporters that he had driven Thomas W. Hyde Jr., a 30-year-old who was suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, to Belle Isle, an island park in the Detroit River, and had helped him kill himself by inhaling carbon monoxide. On Aug. 17 Dr. Kevorkian was charged with assisting in the Aug. 4 suicide.</p>
        <p>After the motion to dismiss the case was filed, the defense surprised the packed courtroom with a videotape made on July 1, in which Mr. Hyde discusses his illness and his desire to end his life with Dr. Kevorkian. 'I Want to Die'</p>
        <p>"I want to end this; I want to die," Mr. Hyde can be heard saying. He also is shown saying, and signing papers certifying, that his decision to end his life was made of his own free will.</p>
        <p>"You have to understand," Dr. Kevorkian says on the tape. "You are in control, no one else -- not even so-called laws."</p>
        <p>Heidi Fernandez, the fiancee of Mr. Hyde, also appears on the tape and was in the courtroom today. "I'm here to show support for Jack," Ms. Fernandez said, choking back sobs. "I'm here for Tom. He's here in spirit."</p>
        <p>After the tape was shown, Dr. Kevorkian asked reporters, "Did anyone doubt that this procedure was meticulously carried out, or is that a loose cannon on the tape?"</p>
