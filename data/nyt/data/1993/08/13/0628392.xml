        <p>Jean Harlow's short life, off screen and on, was the stuff of which movie magazines of her era were made. (In this era, it would be television docudramas.) On screen she was a naughty but nice 1930's girl, slinking, slithering and showing more than a glimpse of stocking for the benefit of tough guys like Gable, Cagney and Tracy. Off screen she made the headlines when Paul Bern, her husband in a reportedly unconsummated marriage, committed suicide and when William Powell, her lover in a presumably consummated romance, wept at her funeral. She was only 26.</p>
        <p>"Harlow: The Blond Bombshell" is consciously in the movie-magazine mode, even to describing the star as wanting nothing more than to quit Hollywood and settle down with Mr. Right: "Beneath her film image, an old-fashioned housewife was struggling to get out."</p>

        <p>Jean Harlow's short life, off screen and on, was the stuff of which movie magazines of her era were made. (In this era, it would be television docudramas.) On screen she was a naughty but nice 1930's girl, slinking, slithering and showing more than a glimpse of stocking for the benefit of tough guys like Gable, Cagney and Tracy. Off screen she made the headlines when Paul Bern, her husband in a reportedly unconsummated marriage, committed suicide and when William Powell, her lover in a presumably consummated romance, wept at her funeral. She was only 26.</p>
        <p>"Harlow: The Blond Bombshell" is consciously in the movie-magazine mode, even to describing the star as wanting nothing more than to quit Hollywood and settle down with Mr. Right: "Beneath her film image, an old-fashioned housewife was struggling to get out."</p>
        <p>The sentiments are delivered by Sharon Stone, this season's sexpot. Her outfits and poses are a droll and reasonably successful effort to give Ms. Stone that 1930-ish aura. She enters and exits in starlike fashion, to dramatic lighting, and is never painful to watch, but even when not lying back, she is too laid back to evoke the years when stars were stars.</p>
        <p>Harlow's career took off with "Hell's Angels," a Howard Hughes airplane extravaganza. She was 19 and won the audience with lines like "Would you be shocked if I put on something more comfortable?" and an attitude to match. For most of her career, she would be appearing in seemingly comfortable outfits, although the account on Sunday night sympathizes with her for being sewn into form-fitting gowns that made going to the bathroom difficult, suffering from allergies to makeup and having to diet constantly and platinumize her hair every night.</p>
        <p>As the generous assortment of clips demonstrates, her first efforts at acting were rudimentary, consisting largely of a hand-on-hip stance and come-hither movements. Her vocal apparatus was not as well trained as her physical apparatus. But studio writers learned how to accommodate her talents. Reclining in "The Beast of the City," she said in her inviting way, "There's one position that's always up to me." In "Red-Headed Woman," which got the studio into trouble with the Hays Office, she played Lil, who slept her way to success with five men. You can see the long-forgotten Chester Morris trying to distance himself from her in a telephone booth.</p>
        <p>She is shown here at her best in "Red Dust." Maybe the matchup with Clark Gable, her most frequent co-star, inspired her, or maybe it was the don't-give-a-damn role, but everything seemed to work. The biography makes some interesting connections between the plots of some of her movies and the distressing events in her life, along with sappily up-to-date observations like "The only place she could feel empowered was in front of the camera."</p>
        <p>Even if you don't care much about the lives of the stars, you may still get a kick out of the Harlow movies with which TNT follows up the documentary. For insomniacs and videotapers, there are "Libeled Lady," "Red Dust" and "China Seas." Coming up later in the month are "Dinner at Eight," "Bombshell" and Frank Capra's 1931 "Platinum Blonde." 'Parents on Trial' 'Was It Murder?'  Court TV Sunday at 9 P.M.</p>
        <p>The latest offering in Court TV's weekly "Trial Story" series has to do with a Washington State couple accused of scalding their 6-week-old baby to death. So it has a heavy emotional punch to add to the inherent drama of a trial, almost any trial. But the series as a whole is not doing much to fulfill the promise of the Courtroom Television Network's promoters to educate viewers about the law.</p>
        <p>Cynthia McFadden's commentary is given mainly to making sure you can tell the prosecutors from the defense lawyers and to keeping you tuned in for the verdict. The efficiently edited program does differ from other real-life shows that draw on similar material in not displaying pictures of the scalded baby, but Court TV should be able to do better than that.</p>
        <p>At a time when prosecutions for child abuse are being questioned, this was an opportunity to open up that issue, with at least a reference to what is going on outside the Washington courtroom. If that seemed too strenuous, the program might have drawn attention to the use of expert witnesses, who are seen giving conflicting opinions on the circumstances of the baby's death. Some viewers must be wondering about the remarkable fact that in so many trials both the prosecution and the defense are able to find experts to suit their desires. But Sunday's program does not go into that, either.</p>
        <p>Court TV remains a welcome addition to the ever-growing potpourri of cable channels, but it is going to have to work harder if it does not want to sentence itself to being just another, somewhat more respectable purveyor of courtroom melodrama. Harlow The Blond Bombshell  TNT, Sunday at 8 P.M. Narrated by Sharon Stone; directed by Tom McQuade; teleplay by Paul Boorstin. A Propaganda Films production for TNT. Patrick Faulstich, producer; Sigurjon Sighvatsson and Steve Golin, executive producers.</p>
