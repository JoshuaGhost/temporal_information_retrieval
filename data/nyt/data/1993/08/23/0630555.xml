        <p>A large suitcase containing the headless remains of a man was found on the sidewalk of a Brooklyn intersection early yesterday morning. The body, which was discovered at 4:16 A.M. near an abandoned lot at St. Mark's and Howard Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant, appeared to be that of a white or Hispanic man, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Anthony Barlanti. An anonymous person called the police to report seeing a suitcase with feet sticking out of it, he said. When officers arrived, they found the body intact, except for the head, in a gray suitcase. The head was not found. Sergeant Barlanti said the case did not appear to be connected to the killings of five gay men whose bodies were found dismembered in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania over the last two years.</p>
