        <p>Things move a little faster during a pennant race. Slumping players are benched and promising rookies get jolted or promoted because there is an urgency to every game. Domingo Jean and Mark Hutton have discovered just how fast things can move.</p>
        <p>The two prized pitching prospects switched places on Thursday when the Yankees announced that Jean would be summoned from Class AAA to oppose the Twins in his debut Sunday and returned Hutton to Columbus after only three starts and 14 days in pinstripes. A 23-year-old Australian departed and a 24-year-old Dominican will soon arrive. The search for another steady starter continued.</p>
        <p>"Right now, patience is short up there because of where they are in the standings," said Mike Brown, the Class AAA pitching coach. "The only problem with being young is you're going to make mistakes."</p>
        <p>But not this year, not with a two-game margin separating the Yankees from the first-place Blue Jays. The Yankees cannot afford to have a weak link in their rotation, as Hutton was during his last two starts, so he will make his next outing Sunday in Columbus. It was a development Hutton (1-1, 4.60 earned run average) knew was possible.</p>
        <p>"If I struggle, perhaps they'll go with someone else," said Hutton, before his last start produced four innings, four walks, five hits and two runs against Toronto Tuesday. "We're getting down to where the games are fairly important."</p>
        <p>Fairly important is accurate as the Yankees have 51 games left after losing here tonight to the Twins to try to overtake Toronto. They do not play the Jays again until Sept. 24-26.</p>
        <p>The newest Yankee will arrive from Columbus on Saturday and then become the second pitcher in two weeks to make his debut, not an ideal situation for a contending team. After Jean is activated on Sunday, outfielder Gerald Williams will be shuttled back to Columbus for the third time.</p>
        <p>"It's a dream come true, but it's not only being in a Yankee uniform," said Jean. "It's doing the job. It's getting the ball and doing the job."</p>
        <p>When Jean gets the ball, he features a 95-mile-an-hour fastball, a slider and a sinker that enabled him to go 2-2 with a 2.82 e.r.a. at Class AAA. Jean joined the Yankees organization in 1992 as part of the Steve Sax deal, which also brought Melido Perez and Bob Wickman to New York.</p>
        <p>Now Jean is with New York, too, and in a pennant race. "There's no pressure," he said. "I don't put pressure on myself. I like baseball so much. It's all I do."  BASEBALL</p>
