        <p>Beaux-Arts Trio</p>
        <p>Mostly Mozart Festival Avery Fisher Hall</p>
        <p>The Beaux-Arts Trio has long been a mainstay of the Mostly Mozart Festival, but its performance on Monday evening was its first appearance there since Isidore Cohen retired last year, ceding the violinist's chair to Ida Kavafian. The ensemble's current lineup also includes Peter Wiley, the cellist who joined in 1987, and Menahem Pressler, the pianist who was one of the trio's founders in 1955.</p>
        <p>One might expect that a sense of continuity would be difficult to maintain when two of the three players were infants when the ensemble was started. But it is exactly this sort of cross-generational collaboration that keeps the classical performance tradition alive and evolving.</p>
        <p>Actually, it works both ways: Mr. Pressler, as the guardian of a style that has made the Beaux-Arts the world's pre-eminent piano trio, is responsible for passing on that style to his younger colleagues. On the other hand, as any collector of the group's recordings can attest, calcified replicas of the group's vintage interpretations would sound archaic now. It is up to Mr. Wiley and Ms. Kavafian to bring freshness to the performances.</p>
        <p>After performing in this configuration for nearly a year, the players have made progress toward a unified style. But in a program that included Mozart's Trio in B flat (K. 502), Beethoven's "Ghost" Trio in D (Op. 70, No. 1) and Schubert's Trio in E flat (Op. 100), there were still occasional rough edges, including intonation problems (although these were not unknown to the previous roster).</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Pressler's colorful, fluid approach to dynamics has been assimilated by Mr. Wiley and Ms. Kavafian, who used it to great effect in the Beethoven and the Schubert and more subtly in the Mozart. Also intact is the trio's use of extremes as a mode of propulsion. The Schubert in particular thrived on the tension between delicacy and brawniness, vehemence and pliancy. And whatever quibbles one may have about technical or interpretive points, the performances illuminated the passions encoded in the works. Of all the Beaux-Arts hallmarks worth preserving, that is the most crucial.</p>
