        <p>A half-century after the end of World War II, Japan last week abandoned years of denial and finally admitted that during the war the Imperial Army had virtually kidnapped and imprisoned thousands of women from one end of Asia to the other, forcing them to have sex with Japanese soldiers in a network of brothels.</p>
        <p>The Government said it decided to issue its apology after interviewing some of the women and discovering new documents in its archives. But the imminent transfer of power to a new reformist Government may have had a lot to do with it.</p>

        <p>A half-century after the end of World War II, Japan last week abandoned years of denial and finally admitted that during the war the Imperial Army had virtually kidnapped and imprisoned thousands of women from one end of Asia to the other, forcing them to have sex with Japanese soldiers in a network of brothels.</p>
        <p>The Government said it decided to issue its apology after interviewing some of the women and discovering new documents in its archives. But the imminent transfer of power to a new reformist Government may have had a lot to do with it.</p>
        <p>The new Government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the first drawn from outside the Liberal Democratic Party in 38 years, was confirmed by Parliament Friday night. It has promised what the departing Liberal Democrats long resisted -- a full apology to other Asian countries for Japan's wartime aggression.</p>
        <p>By announcing their findings on the "comfort women" on Wednesday, their last full day in power, the Liberal Democrats stole some thunder from Mr. Hosokawa while leaving him one of the knottiest remaining issues: whether to pay compensation to the surviving women.</p>
