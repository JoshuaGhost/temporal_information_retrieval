        <p>At the end of the day, a tired cook often copes with dinner by buying some prepared foods and filling in with a bit of cooking at home. There is no better time to rely on such assistance than in the summer, when fresh vegetables are so good and so plentiful they don't need much help.</p>
        <p>Kitchen work can also be reduced by cutting down on the number of pots. In the following recipe for smoked turkey tortellini, you need just one.</p>
        <p>For the best outcome, buy a chunk, not slices, of smoked turkey from the delicatessen or supermarket, and look for an alternative to the ubiquitous Major Grey's mango chutney, because it really doesn't taste very good. The dressing for the tortellini will be only as good as the chutney you put in it.</p>
        <p>Slice some Jersey tomatoes, and ring the dinner bell. Smoked Turkey Tortellini With Chutney-Yogurt Dressing</p>
        <p>4 ounces green beans  6 ounces whole red or yellow bell peppers, or 5 ounces of ready- cut chopped peppers (1 1/4 cups)  4 ounces smoked turkey (1 piece)  8 ounces fresh cheese tortellini  2 ounces soft salad greens  1 medium clove garlic  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  1/3 cup nonfat plain yogurt  2 tablespoons good-quality mango or other chutney  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard. For the side dish:  2 ripe medium tomatoes.</p>
        <p>1. Bring water for green beans and tortellini to a boil in a covered pot.</p>
        <p>2. Wash, trim and cut green beans into one-inch pieces.</p>
        <p>3. Wash, trim, seed and finely chop the whole peppers, and place in a serving bowl.</p>
        <p>4. Cut turkey into bite-size pieces, and add to bowl.</p>
        <p>5. Place green beans and tortellini in boiling water, and cook 3 to 4 minutes; drain.</p>
        <p>6. Wash and dry greens.</p>
        <p>7. With food processor running, put garlic through feed tube.</p>
        <p>8. Squeeze lemon juice, and add to processor along with yogurt, chutney and mustard; process to blend.</p>
        <p>9. Add green beans, tortellini and dressing to bowl, and mix gently to coat thoroughly with dressing.</p>
        <p>10. Arrange greens on serving dish, and top with salad.</p>
        <p>11. Wash, trim and slice tomatoes thickly, and serve as a side dish. Yield: 2 servings.</p>
