        <p>To the Editor</p>
        <p>Forty years ago, my biological parents, a young nurse and a doctor serving his internship, had a child. If anybody had the option of abortion, they did. Nevertheless, they chose to have their child and make that child available for adoption. Whatever their reasoning, their decision was loving, courageous and selfless.</p>
        <p>No less selfless and loving were the actions of the man and woman who adopted me. In "Accidental Justice for Jessica DeBoer" (Op-Ed, July 27), Nerys Patterson, herself adopted, evidently cannot see the entire picture in this girl's tragic story. Jessica's adoptive parents have honored their half of the adoption agreement. They told the truth and have raised their daughter with love. Jessica's birth mother has lied and now seeks to uproot that innocent's life in the most selfish of fashions.</p>

        <p>Forty years ago, my biological parents, a young nurse and a doctor serving his internship, had a child. If anybody had the option of abortion, they did. Nevertheless, they chose to have their child and make that child available for adoption. Whatever their reasoning, their decision was loving, courageous and selfless.</p>
        <p>No less selfless and loving were the actions of the man and woman who adopted me. In "Accidental Justice for Jessica DeBoer" (Op-Ed, July 27), Nerys Patterson, herself adopted, evidently cannot see the entire picture in this girl's tragic story. Jessica's adoptive parents have honored their half of the adoption agreement. They told the truth and have raised their daughter with love. Jessica's birth mother has lied and now seeks to uproot that innocent's life in the most selfish of fashions.</p>
        <p>Ms. Patterson's idea that the adopted have no say in the momentous event in our life is correct. Neither do we, or anybody else, have any say over any of the great twists of life that await us, for good or ill. Jessica has a home provided by loving parents. This is about as secure as life can ever become.</p>
        <p>If adoption is so emotionally wrenching, as Ms. Patterson attests, then to uproot this child again is only further cruelty.</p>
        <p>In the case of Jessica DeBoer, I am one adoptee who is stunned by the fact that there appears to be no sanctity in our law nor any value placed on the truthful words of honorable people. Jessica's case has the power to undermine thousands of future adoptions because it is obvious that nobody's word or intention, not even the court's, is sacred. There is no justice here. Only broken promises, lies and lives damaged beyond measure. JAMES S. FLANAGAN  Norwich, N.Y., July 27, 1993</p>
