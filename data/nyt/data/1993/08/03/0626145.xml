        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Empire Scrambles Back" (editorial, July 24) has a positive headline, for which we thank you. The body of the editorial, however, gives the impression that Empire has made the decision to force its community-rated policyholders into some form of managed care. This is not the case.</p>
        <p>During the interview with your reporter, I discussed various possibilities that might be considered when trying to control health care costs and slow the increase in premium levels. Managed care, of course, was one of those options.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Empire Scrambles Back" (editorial, July 24) has a positive headline, for which we thank you. The body of the editorial, however, gives the impression that Empire has made the decision to force its community-rated policyholders into some form of managed care. This is not the case.</p>
        <p>During the interview with your reporter, I discussed various possibilities that might be considered when trying to control health care costs and slow the increase in premium levels. Managed care, of course, was one of those options.</p>
        <p>In my opinion, managed care can provide quality medical care at a more affordable price. Consequently, I mentioned during the interview that I would like to see Empire strengthen its capabilities in that area and hope that much of the community-rated sector of the business could be persuaded to buy these types of policies.</p>
        <p>That is still my hope. No decision has been reached with regard to new products. We are aware of the grave concerns that some people have about managed care. I think that as people learn more about managed care, these fears will be largely dissipated and that most people will see managed care as an intelligent, cost-effective approach to quality medical care. Still I know that some will prefer to have full freedom of choice, but that can only happen as long as they are willing to pay the additional cost.</p>
        <p>We will discuss the various options carefully with all concerned, so that we can do what is in the best interest of our policyholders and the general public. Yes, Empire is scrambling back. PHILIP BRIGGS  Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield New York, July 27, 1993</p>
