        <p>When George J. Marlin called himself "the conservative Republican candidate for mayor" at a recent housing forum, the partisan audience erupted in catcalls and laughter.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Marlin, who is actually the Conservative-Right to Life candidate for mayor, was not joking or mistaken. He was firing a barb at the man who would follow him on the podium, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor.</p>
        <p>In emphasizing his own Republican roots and conservative beliefs, Mr. Marlin was implying that Mr. Giuliani has neither. And he was seeking to underscore his central campaign message: that Mr. Giuliani has abandoned the Republican Party's right wing to battle Mayor David N. Dinkins for more left-leaning voters. Could Have Serious Impact</p>
        <p>It is a message that could have a serious impact on the Mayoral election. In his dogged assault on Mr. Giuliani -- a man he calls Mr. Dinkins's "political clone" -- Mr. Marlin poses an important question: Can he siphon enough votes from Mr. Giuliani on the right to tip the scales toward Mr. Dinkins?</p>
        <p>The race is considered quite tight. Though a Daily News poll this week placed Mr. Giuliani 10 percentage points ahead of Mr. Dinkins, other recent polls have shown the race to be a statistical dead heat. Those same polls have shown Mr. Marlin receiving between 2 and 3 percent of the vote -- even before he was exposed to a large number of voters.</p>
        <p>In 1989, Mr. Dinkins defeated Mr. Giuliani by just over 2 percentage points. In that election, the Right to Life candidate, Henry Hewes, won just under 1 percent of the vote while the Conservative candidate, Ronald S. Lauder, won .5 percent. 'A Potential for Erosion'</p>
        <p>"Clearly Giuliani is trying to portray himself as a more moderate inclusive candidate, and that means there is a potential for erosion from the right," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of Marist College's Institute for Public Opinion. "That doesn't mean Marlin will get 10 percent of the vote. But if he gets 5 percent, his role will be great."</p>
        <p>Each vote will almost certainly be pared from Mr. Giuliani's trove. Running on a platform of lower taxes, smaller government and cultural conservatism, Mr. Marlin, a bank executive who is the son of a New York City police officer, seeks to appeal to middle-class homeowners, landlords, small-business owners, Orthodox Jews, Roman Catholics and Evangelical Protestants -- all part of Mr. Giuliani's election equation.</p>
        <p>"There's no question that he's costing Giuliani some votes," said Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island, who is supporting Mr. Giuliani. "But that only becomes significant if it becomes very tight."</p>
        <p>Mr. Marlin's supporters say that he is already doing better than his predecessors without having officially begun a campaign. And they take heart from a poll in June for New York 1 News, the cable television station, showing him receiving 7 percent of the Hispanic vote, an indication that he can win a significant slice of a swing constituency.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marlin is also banking on support from what he calls "the new coalition in city politics" -- the conservative religious groups, neighborhood associations and parent organizations that protested against the policies of former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez.</p>
        <p>To many of those conservative groups, Mr. Marlin's credentials are rock solid. He opposes abortion, legislation protecting the rights of homosexuals and condom distribution in schools, while supporting tax credits and vouchers for parents who send their children to private schools. He has also called for rolling back rent protections for tenants, reducing the city work force and shifting many city services to private businesses. Supported by Fernandez Foe</p>
        <p>"George Marlin is in line with our principles," said the Rev. J. Terry Twerell, founder of the New York City chapter of the Christian Coalition. The conservative group, which is affiliated with Pat Robertson, plans to publish a voters' guide to the mayoral race similar to one it distributed during last year's community school board races.</p>
        <p>"We've looked at Giuliani and he's got two or three things we would struggle with," Mr. Twerell added, pointing to Mr. Giuliani's support for gay and abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marlin also has the support of Mary A. Cummins, a member of Community School Board 24 in Queens who became a symbol of conservative defiance to Mr. Fernandez when she denounced the "Children of the Rainbow" curriculum guide. Mr. Marlin, who is married and has no children, lives in Ridgewood, Queens, which is part of District 24.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's response to the challenge from his right has been to studiously ignore it. His campaign often declines even to utter Mr. Marlin's name. "We have nothing to say about the man," said Richard Bryers, Mr. Giuliani's spokesman.</p>
        <p>But in a recent scene that may become more common as Mr. Marlin turns up the volume on his campaign, he provoked a sharp reaction from Mr. Giuliani by accusing him of supporting a measure to register voters on Rikers Island during a talk show on WABC-AM radio. 'A Demagogue,' Giuliani Says</p>
        <p>Reached for comment by Jay Diamond, the talk-show host, Mr. Giuliani denied supporting the idea. But he said of Mr. Marlin: "For a guy who sort of pretends to be a principled candidate, he's really a demagogue. He doesn't get the facts right. He seems so desperate to want to make charges against me that he doesn't bother to be careful."</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, Mr. Giuliani sought the Conservative Party's nomination but was rejected in favor of Mr. Marlin by a three-to-one vote in a party convention.</p>
        <p>Privately, some of Mr. Giuliani's supporters say Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato encouraged the party to support Mr. Marlin. They theorize that Mr. D'Amato wanted to protect his power in the party by preventing Mr. Giuliani from gaining influence over it. Mr. D'Amato, a Republican who has endorsed Mr. Giuliani for Mayor, is expected to seek the party's endorsement next year if he runs for Governor.</p>
        <p>Michael Long, the Conservative Party's state chairman, said the party rejected Mr. Giuliani simply because he sought the Liberal Party nomination first. But he acknowledged that next year's gubernatorial race was a factor in the party's decision to endorse Mr. Marlin. Oddly, Help From Dinkins</p>
        <p>"The Republicans have given Mario Cuomo his best shot to win because now he can say: 'Why are they calling me a liberal? Didn't they just run Rudy Giuliani on a fusion ticket?' " Mr. Long said.</p>
        <p>Among the Democrats, Mr. Marlin's campaign has produced one of the odder paradoxes of the race. Having accused Mr. Giuliani of appealing to the far right, aides to Mr. Dinkins now go out of their way to praise the more conservative Mr. Marlin.</p>
        <p>"I think he's an impressive candidate," said Bill Lynch, Mr. Dinkins' campaign manager. "He's different from candidates who have run on those lines in the past. He's sharper, better on the stump and seems to have more resources."</p>
        <p>The Dinkins campaign is also expected to support Mr. Marlin's efforts to be included in all mayoral debates. Since he expects to run a shoestring campaign on about $500,000, Mr. Marlin is counting on debates to provide a major forum for his ideas -- and presumably, attacks on Mr. Giuliani. 'Street-Corner Conservative'</p>
        <p>Born in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, the lanky 6-foot-6-inch Mr. Marlin, 40, calls himself "a street-corner conservative." But in person, he exudes the air of a philosophy professor, keeping scribbled quotes from favorite books in his pockets and wearing small oval glasses that slide down his nose.</p>
        <p>Even his accent is more Oxonian than Queens, particularly when he quotes Aquinas, Aristotle or William F. Buckley Jr., the Conservative Party mayoral candidate in 1965 who is now one of his supporters.</p>
        <p>He attended Roman Catholic schools in Queens, where his family moved when he was 7, and later graduated from Iona College with a bachelor's degree in political science and philosophy. He has written a book on municipal bonds and edited the collected works of G. K. Chesterton, the conservative British writer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marlin said he would take a leave of absence from his job as a vice-president and portfolio manager at United States Trust Company in Manhattan after Labor Day to campaign full-time. Registering to Vote</p>
        <p>New Yorkers who are not registerd to vote and who wish to vote in the primary election on Sept. 14 must register by today. People can register at the Board of Elections offices in each of the five boroughs, or by mail, provided that the mailing is postmarked before Saturdays.</p>
