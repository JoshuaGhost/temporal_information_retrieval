        <p>The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia has accused the United Nations of "genocide against the people" in continuing to enforce economic sanctions against his country.</p>
        <p>In an interview the Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, angrily condemned what he considers the injustice of continuing the sanctions, which were first imposed in May 1992 and were tightened in April.

        <p>The Prime Minister of Yugoslavia has accused the United Nations of "genocide against the people" in continuing to enforce economic sanctions against his country.</p>
        <p>In an interview the Prime Minister, Radoje Kontic, angrily condemned what he considers the injustice of continuing the sanctions, which were first imposed in May 1992 and were tightened in April. They had been imposed because Serbia, one of the two remaining republics in Yugoslavia, was deemed an aggressor in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But he said the United Nations force there had said "not one Yugoslav soldier" was in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>"Our influence on the Bosnian Serbs has been exaggerated," Mr. Kontic continued. "I'm not saying there is none, but our influence is limited." Accepted a Plan, Now Defunct</p>
        <p>He argued that the sanctions should have been lifted after Yugoslavia accepted the so-called Vance-Owen plan, the peace proposal for Bosnia and Herzegovina put forward by the United Nations and the European Community.</p>
        <p>"Now, tell me, what should we do now that the Vance-Owen plan is dead?" the Prime Minister asked. "Why are such rigorous measures applied against Yugoslavia?</p>
        <p>"Sanctions are genocide against the people."</p>
        <p>Continuation of the sanctions "can create an unpredictable effect on the people and the economy," Mr. Kontic said. "As a reaction to the situation caused by the sanctions, very extreme and very militant groups are being formed, and also some very nationalistic forces."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kontic's Government may have little ability to sway the Bosnian Serbs; it surely has only limited influence in Yugoslavia itself. Today it is the Serbian republic, led by President Slobodan Milosevic, that is regarded as the center of power in Belgrade. A Shriveled Federation</p>
        <p>The interview took place in Mr. Kontic's office in the vast Palace of the Republic, a once crowded and bustling seat of Government in New Belgrade, across the Sava River from the capital. But in a reminder of how Yugoslavia has shrunk from six republics totaling 23 million people to two republics with 10.5 million people, the palace's long corridors are lined with empty offices. Mr. Kontic is from Montenegro, the other remaining republic.</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister said that with some sectors of the economy "completely destroyed," the gross national product of Serbia and Montenegro had been halved, from $25 billion in 1991 to a maximum of $13 billion this year.</p>
        <p>"All investment has ceased, meaning no development," said Mr. Kontic, who succeeded Milan Panic in December when the latter challenged Mr. Milosevic and was ousted. "There is no foreign capital whatsoever. Incomes fell. In 1991 the average monthly salary was $250; in the last few months, the average was not more than $30."</p>
        <p>Of 2.2 million employed in the state sector, 800,000 have been placed on long-term leave on minimal pay, the Prime Minister said. "We have reached the level of an underdeveloped country of the third world," he said.</p>
