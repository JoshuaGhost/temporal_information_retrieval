        <p>AT $160 a day, a criminal offender's stay in the County Jail here has become an expensive proposition for taxpayers. A program to divert some nonviolent criminals from prison to rehabilitation services and shelters proved to be a cost-effective alternative last year, saving the county $3 million, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said.</p>
        <p>"The criminal-justice system is burdened with individuals whose crimes do not necessarily warrant a jail term and who actually may be better helped by less-expensive programs," Mr. O'Rourke explained.</p>

        <p>AT $160 a day, a criminal offender's stay in the County Jail here has become an expensive proposition for taxpayers. A program to divert some nonviolent criminals from prison to rehabilitation services and shelters proved to be a cost-effective alternative last year, saving the county $3 million, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said.</p>
        <p>"The criminal-justice system is burdened with individuals whose crimes do not necessarily warrant a jail term and who actually may be better helped by less-expensive programs," Mr. O'Rourke explained.</p>
        <p>This year, the county is continuing to seek alternatives to incarceration with $586,787 in financing from the State Division of Probation and Correction Alternatives. The money, which is matched by the county, helps pay for 11 programs for nonviolent offenders who are drug-addicted, mentally ill, mentally retarded or developmentally disabled -- groups that often are victimized by other criminal offenders, said Robert M. Maccarone, director of the county's Office of Criminal Justice Services and director of the War on Drugs in Westchester. Violent Offenders Excluded</p>
        <p>Candidates for alternative programs do not include those in prison on murder, rape, robbery or other violent-offense charges, Mr. Maccarone said. Last year 650 offenders were placed in six such programs.</p>
        <p>In one plan, the Direct Treatment Alternatives to Incarceration Program, 41 drug or alcohol offenders were diverted from jail to daylong treatment services that specialized in on-site probation supervision.</p>
        <p>Another 228 offenders participated in a Department of Probation Community Service Program, performing more than 11,000 hours of community service estimated by the county to be worth $52,000. The offenders were sentenced to landscaping, painting and park-cleaning jobs. The program's sentencing arrangement targeted jail-bound felony and misdemeanor offenders. Program for Young Women</p>
        <p>The Female Youth Shelter Program of Westchester provided vocational, recreational, educational and cultural programs -- along with shelter -- for 16- to 21-year-old women, who were not released on recognizance or who were unable to raise bail.</p>
        <p>The Legal Aid Society of Westchester reviewed felony cases related to drug and alcohol abuse and helped place 31 people last year in the Special Defender-Based Advocacy program. The program developed specific plans, used during the pre-sentencing period, for each client.</p>
        <p>Another program, called Pre-Trial Services of Westchester, Monitored Release Program, was aimed at reducing the number of people in jail awaiting trial.  Bail Program Saves $560,593</p>
        <p>The Pre-Trial Services Institute of Westchester, Bail Expediting Program, served another 346 clients by screening all people detained at the jail who were being held on bail of $5,000 or less and free of pending warrants. The program expedited posting of bail, reducing the number of people who remained in jail while awaiting trial. It was estimated that the program saved taxpayers $560,593.</p>
        <p>Other programs include one for for developmentally disabled offenders and for some 16- through 19-year-old nonviolent male offenders who are instead placed in shelters. Also, the County Probation Department uses its Electronic Home-Detention Program to monitor individuals detained at home in lieu of pretrial and sentenced incarceration.</p>
        <p>The alternative programs are developed by a 25-member Criminal Justice Advisory Board, whose members are appointed by the County Executive.</p>
