        <p>IT may be true, as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission contends, that the agency's new regulations on harassment in the workplace break no new legal or policy grounds. But the regs, which will be published for comment by the public as soon as the Office of Management and Budget and everyone else within the Government has had his or her say, may by their very existence send a message to companies about firming and toning their harassment policies.</p>
        <p>The regs are in the pipeline at least in part because sexual harassment has received so much attention in the last few years, obscuring harassment based on race, religion, national origin and disability. They are a reminder that all forms of harassment are discrimination and that proving it rests on similar legal arguments.</p>

        <p>IT may be true, as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission contends, that the agency's new regulations on harassment in the workplace break no new legal or policy grounds. But the regs, which will be published for comment by the public as soon as the Office of Management and Budget and everyone else within the Government has had his or her say, may by their very existence send a message to companies about firming and toning their harassment policies.</p>
        <p>The regs are in the pipeline at least in part because sexual harassment has received so much attention in the last few years, obscuring harassment based on race, religion, national origin and disability. They are a reminder that all forms of harassment are discrimination and that proving it rests on similar legal arguments.</p>
        <p>"Other harassment also violates anti-discrimination law," said Dianna Johston, an E.E.O.C. assistant legal counsel in the Title VII equal pay division, who said the different types of discrimination rested on similar arguments. "We felt a need to consolidate the rules in one place."</p>
        <p>The regs draw on bits and pieces of anti-discrimination law, agency rulings and previous E.E.O.C. publications like the National Origin Guidelines. A refresher course, from the draft copy of the new regs:</p>
        <p>* Employers have a duty to maintain a working environment free of harassment based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age or disability.</p>
        <p>* Conduct is harassment if it creates a hostile, intimidating or offensive work environment, unreasonably interferes with the individual's work or adversely affects the employee's employment opportunities. The conduct includes such things as racist epithets, raunchy jokes and ethnic slurs, and usually, though not always, has to be systematic.</p>
        <p>* The standard for evaluating harassment is whether a reasonable person in the same or similar circumstances would find the conduct intimidating, hostile or abusive. The perspective of the victim -- his or her race, gender, age, place of origin, etc. -- has an important place in the evaluation. "You take into account particular sensitivities or histories," Ms. Johnston said. "Men might regard some jokes as flattering. Women don't agree."</p>
        <p>* Unwanted sexual conduct is not the only form of sexual harassment. "Gender-based animus" is also harassment. "It usually occurs where women have gone into traditionally male professions," Ms. Johnston said. "Male co-workers might try to make her life miserable." However, men entering traditionally female professions could also be victims of gender-based animus.</p>
        <p>* Employers are liable for the acts of those who work for them if they knew or should have known about the conduct and took no immediate, appropriate corrective action. Employers who fail to draw up explicit, detailed anti-harassment policies and grievance procedures may put themselves at particular risk. "Employers are not required per se to have policies," Ms. Johnston said, but if they do not, employees can assume "the supervisor is acting with the imprimatur of the company."</p>
        <p>SOME civil rights lawyers are less cautious than the E.E.O.C. about the new regs' potential impact. "It seemed they felt a need for a clear statement," said Stephen Paskoff, a former E.E.O.C. lawyer and civil rights litigator who now teaches companies how to follow workplace law. "It says that we are going to treat other things with as much seriousness as sexual harassment."</p>
        <p>Companies have jumped on the sexual harassment training bandwagon, Mr. Paskoff said, to the detriment of other concerns. "Men often feel harassment workshops aren't for them," he said. Companies get their employees' attention more quickly by making it clear they are concerned about all forms of harassment. "Companies should indicate there is a global behavioral standard they expect their employees to follow. If we say sexual jokes are inappropriate, we can use that as a model to say why age-based or raced-based jokes are inappropriate."</p>
        <p>Perhaps with the optimism of the committed trial lawyer, Mr. Paskoff said he expected the codified guidelines to have some impact on plaintiffs' chances in court. They may make it harder for the courts to ignore the E.E.O.C. as they decide discrimination cases. "The courts can get around it, but at least it requires them to look at it," he said. A LEGAL FIELD TO WATCH</p>
        <p>IS discrimination law, once a legal speciality beloved only by idealists devoted to poverty, about to move uptown?</p>
        <p>Stephen Paskoff, a civil rights lawyer, has been building a business on companies' worries they may run afoul of workplace civil rights law. As president of Employment Learning Innovations in Atlanta, he teaches companies how to foster equality at work and avoid litigation. He believes a convergence of political, legal and social factors may put civil rights on an upwardly mobile path:</p>
        <p>* Politics: Unlike his recent predecessors, President Clinton genuinely supports civil rights law; that is clear from his statements and Justice Department appointments.</p>
        <p>* Society: Americans are becoming more aware, thanks to Anita Hill and Rodney King, of race and gender.</p>
        <p>* Legislation: New laws, like the Family and Medical Leave Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act, are now in force and have heightened awareness of civil rights.</p>
        <p>* Economics: Many other areas of law are becoming less lucrative. For example, it is getting harder to win big verdicts in liability law.</p>
        <p>These changes are turning "what used to be an unprofitable area into another tort," Mr. Paskoff said. "Good lawyers are jumping in."</p>
        <p>Welcome to Dan Quayle's nightmare.</p>
