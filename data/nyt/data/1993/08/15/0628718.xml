        <p>THEIR names are Rage, Page, Sage and Pamela, and false eyelashes, red lips and helmets of blonde hair are their trademarks. They perform as the Gloo Girls, singing screechy rock-and-roll. Their first album, "Attention Shoppers," will be released this fall by Moving Target Records. They're also professional furniture movers.</p>
        <p>Now, the Gloo Girls, who are the four owners of Amazon Movers, have opened Amazon Moving and Surplus, a secondhand furniture store on Lafayette Street in Manhattan. The shop, which opened on Aug. 6, proves that these women have an eye for the design of the 1950's and early 1960's, the era that influences their music.</p>
        <p>"We like anything that looks like the Jetsons," Sage, whose full name is Karen LeSage, said last weekend before the store opened for its second day of business. She was wearing an Amazon Movers tank top that depicted three women hoisting chairs and boxes over their heads. "These are our day jobs," she added. "Musicians have to have day jobs."</p>
        <p>The store evolved out of the five-month-old moving company, which evolved out of the 14-month-old band that has been known to perform in Mylar costumes and on skates.</p>
        <p>The group's expansion from music to moving was not planned. "We had the truck to move our band equipment, and other bands asked us to help them," said Page Wells (her given name), who at 6 feet, is the closest to an Amazon. "We thought it would be a good idea to form an all-woman moving company. Women are usually excluded from these kinds of jobs."</p>
        <p>The evolution to retail occurred because people sometimes pay for moves, in part, with furniture. The partners are discerning in what they will take as payment. Among the best pieces they have received from recent moving jobs are a pair of tubular aluminum chairs covered in turquoise vinyl ($100 each), a yellow and green Formica and chrome dinette set ($400 for a table and four chairs) and a vintage exercise bike called a Slendercycle ($225). Other items, including stylish aluminum-legged office chairs ($90 each), a turquoise glass cocktail pitcher with six gold-rimmed glasses ($135) and several 1950's lamps with fiberglass shades ($75 to $200), come from flea markets and yard sales.</p>
        <p>Rage, whose real name is Patty Giovanniello, does most of the buying. "I don't buy things just because they have a name," she said of the mostly unsigned pieces in the store. "We like bright colors, and we're totally against natural fibers." She pointed out the coral-colored cushions on a love seat and chair with plywood legs by Thonet ($725), which was among the few items that did have a pedigree. "Its got the original plastic upholstery," she said.</p>
        <p>Each of the four band members (Pamela Dare is trying to decide on a rhyming name) goes out occasionally on moving jobs, but they recently ran an ad in The Village Voice for helpers. "We got a huge response from lots of great Amazonian women," Page said.</p>
        <p>As movers, they charge $20 per woman per hour, and an additional $15 per hour for each truck used, plus packing materials. "There are no hidden charges, like for stairs, that you get with other moving companies," Rage said.</p>
        <p>She is amused by the stir that their unconventional company has caused in the business. "Moishe has been asking people about us," Rage said, speaking of Moishe Mana, the owner of the well-known New York moving company. "He's been going around saying, 'Have you heard about those Amazon women?' "</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Mana said: "I think its really great that women are standing up and saying, 'Look, we can do it too.' I wish them good luck."</p>
        <p>Amazon Moving and Surplus, located at 240 Lafayette Street, between Prince and Spring Streets, is open 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., seven days a week (212) 343-9415.</p>
