        <p>On a hot day recently, two owners of Burmese pythons took their six-foot-long pets for a swim in the Washington Square fountain. On a recent Sunday, four young snake enthusiasts had lunch near the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park while their pets cavorted in the grass. Nearby, a three-foot-long boa constrictor knotted itself around the low branches of a tree as a crowd gathered to gawk and touch the exotic reptile. One man tied a red AIDS-awareness ribbon onto the snake coiled around his neck.</p>
        <p>Spotting pet pythons or iguanas on shoulders about town was a rarity 10 years ago. Today, it's not uncommon.</p>
        <p>The reptiles are available at pet stores, which sometimes fail to warn shoppers how large the snakes will grow -- up to 20 feet for the Burmese giant python. Chris Hernan, a herpetologist and a special projects coordinator in the ornithology department at the Bronx Zoo, said the zoo gets two to three calls a week from python owners who want to donate pets that have grown too large, but the zoo does not accept them. Mr. Hernan recommended that snake owners educate themselves by contacting the New York Herpetological Society, a nonprofit educational group (P.O. Box 1245, New York 10163-1245).</p>
        <p>Experts say iguanas, which are vegetarians, make fine pets with distinct personalities. But Michael Hano, president of the herpetological society, advises against walking around with a python because although they are usually gentle, they are not domesticated animals and could become frightened and constrict, which is how they kill. But some men will probably always consider wearing a giant python like a feather boa to be a display of machismo.</p>
