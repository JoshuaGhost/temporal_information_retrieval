        <p>This is the latest in a series of television advertisements that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor of New York City, has broadcast in recent days.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN: Pictures of bearded, sandy-haired lawyer talking in book-lined office, pictures of Mr. Giuliani greeting merchant at Bronx Terminal Market and an elderly woman at a senior citizens' center. Camera pans through leafy trees to door of Rutgers Houses housing project on Lower East Side. Silent captions on screen say: "Rudy Giuliani's office secured over 4,000 criminal convictions in five years," and, "Less than one percent of Giuliani's criminal convictions were overturned." At end, logo appears on blue background: "Rudy Giuliani. He knows how to get things done."</p>

        <p>This is the latest in a series of television advertisements that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate for mayor of New York City, has broadcast in recent days.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN: Pictures of bearded, sandy-haired lawyer talking in book-lined office, pictures of Mr. Giuliani greeting merchant at Bronx Terminal Market and an elderly woman at a senior citizens' center. Camera pans through leafy trees to door of Rutgers Houses housing project on Lower East Side. Silent captions on screen say: "Rudy Giuliani's office secured over 4,000 criminal convictions in five years," and, "Less than one percent of Giuliani's criminal convictions were overturned." At end, logo appears on blue background: "Rudy Giuliani. He knows how to get things done."</p>
        <p>PRODUCER: Garth Group of New York.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT: Randy Mastro, former Assistant United States Attorney, now a lawyer in private practice:</p>
        <p>I worked with Rudy Giuliani for five years during his tenure as U.S. Attorney. Of course, a lot of Rudy Giuliani's cases got headlines, because they were newsworthy, he was breaking new ground and doing important work for the public. But there are so many cases that Rudy did that never got any publicity, that were a tremendous help to people in their neighborhoods, and in their local communities. There were major problems in evicting drug dealers who had public housing apartments. Rudy Giuliani's office used the civil forfeiture laws to force those drug dealers out of public housing, and the tenants literally cheered when these drug dealers were forced out of their buildings. That's the kind of case that didn't get a lot of headlines, but the people in that public housing project appreciated that the drug dealers were forced out of those buildings. And that's just one of many examples of the kind of cases that Rudy did.</p>
        <p>ACCURACY: While this ad states Mr. Giuliani's overall conviction rate, it omits any mention of how many of his most celebrated prosecutions -- including those against Bess Myerson, Imelda Marcos, former Representative Robert Garcia and others -- resulted either in acquittals or reversals on appeal. As United States Attorney, Mr. Giuliani made wide use of Federal asset forfeiture laws, a tactic that was sometimes criticized as prematurely depriving innocent people of money or property.  SCORECARD: This ad is a not-so-subtle effort to inoculate Mr. Giuliani against attacks by Mayor David N. Dinkins that his record as a prosecutor has been overstated. It uses the words of one of Mr. Giuliani's colleagues to praise him for all the quiet, effective work the public may not have seen, in an effort to counter charges that he was a publicity-hound. By focusing on efforts to evict drug dealers from public housing, it simultaneously portrays Mr. Giuliani as tough on crime and sensitive to the needs of the poor and minorities, many of whom live in the city's housing projects. Finally, and without ever naming him, the ad attacks the Mayor by saying Mr. Giuliani knows how to get things done, a claim that strongly suggests that Mr. Dinkins doesn't.</p>
