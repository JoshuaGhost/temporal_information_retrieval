        <p>The Clinton Administration has assured the United Nations that it will provide most of the 30,000 or so new troops who would help enforce any Bosnian peace agreement that may emerge from the crucial round of talks that are to open in Geneva on Monday, diplomats and United Nations officials say.</p>

        <p>The Clinton Administration has assured the United Nations that it will provide most of the 30,000 or so new troops who would help enforce any Bosnian peace agreement that may emerge from the crucial round of talks that are to open in Geneva on Monday, diplomats and United Nations officials say.</p>
        <p>But prospects appear increasingly poor for the current peace proposal, which has been drawn up by Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations and Lord Owen for the European Community.</p>
        <p>The Muslim-led Bosnian Government on Saturday vehemently rejected the proposal, which would partition Bosnia and Herzegovina into the loose union of three ethnically distinct states. The plan was conditionally approved by the Bosnian Serbs, who want an end to sanctions on Belgrade and who asserted to the United Nations that they would not offer any more concessions to the Muslim-led Government. The Bosnian Croats also conditionally agreed to the plan, provided that they are given additional territory for their proposed state.</p>
        <p>The peace efforts suffered another setback in the last week when Bosnian Muslim troops attacked French peacekeeping soldiers occupying positions on Mount Igman, the strategically important hill overlooking Sarajevo. Bosnian Serb forces had been persuaded to withdraw from Mount Igman, and another peak, Mount Bjelasnica, at the demand of the Bosnian Muslims and under pressure from the United States and its allies.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, peacekeepers on Igman came under more than four hours of what they called intensive and deliberate fire by Muslim fighters, United Nations officials said. The French soldiers fired back and said they believed that they had inflicted casualties among the Bosnian Muslims. The peacekeepers' commander was seriously wounded in the clash and had to be evacuated. Seeking Secure Access to Sea</p>
        <p>After a meeting in Sarajevo on Thursday with Kofi Annan, the United Nations Under Secretary General for peacekeeping, Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian President and a Muslim, said those responsible for the attack would be punished.</p>
        <p>In the meeting, Mr. Izetbegovic also said he wanted more secure access to the Adriatic Sea for the landlocked Muslim state he is being offered under the Owen-Stoltenberg plan. But the Bosnian President repeated his demand for the return of previously Muslim-majority territory, mainly in eastern Bosnia, that had been seized by Bosnian Serb forces. With his demand, and that of the Bosnian Croats, the partition plan will almost certainly encounter more obstacles in the talks on Monday.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, Bosnian Serbs would be required to yield about one-third of the land they occupy, retaining about 52 percent in the form of a Serbian state that would comprise a section along Serbia and Montenegro, in eastern Bosnia, and Serb-held areas in the northwest.</p>
        <p>The proposed Muslim state, about 30 percent, would consist of the region around Sarajevo and Tuzla connected by narrow, exposed roads to the Muslim enclave at Bihac, in the northwest, and to the "safe areas" of Gorazde, Zepa and Srebrenica, in the east. Route to Sava River</p>
        <p>Another road through Croat-held territory would give the Muslims a measure of access to the Adriatic port of Ploce, and arrangements would be made to allow them access to the Sava River near Brcko, in the northeast.</p>
        <p>Bosnian Croats would receive two separate blocks of land, in the north and south, about 17 percent both of which directly border Croatia. This would allow the Serbian and Croatian states to link up and form a "Greater Serbia" and a "Greater Croatia," leaving the Muslims isolated and vulnerable in the middle.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Annan's meeting last week in Belgrade with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, the Serbian leader made clear that ethnic Serbs would not be the first to resume hostilities if the Muslims continued to reject the peace plan. But officials said President Milosevic also insisted that Bosnia's Serbs could not be expected to make further territorial concessions.</p>
        <p>If some version of the Owen-Stoltenberg peace plan is eventually accepted by all the factions, NATO planners estimate that 40,000 to 50,000 troops would be needed to enforce the proposed partition of the country. 7,600 Troops Are Due Soon</p>
        <p>About 9,500 United Nations troops, mostly French, British, Spanish and Canadian, are already deployed in Bosnia. An additional 7,600 are to arrive in September and October to guard a handful of Muslim enclaves, mostly in the east, that have been designated "safe areas" by the Security Council.</p>
        <p>Britain, France, Canada and Spain are reluctant to send any more troops, and Germany, Italy and Turkey have been excluded from the peacekeeping operation on political grounds. Russia has offered 10,000 troops, but it is unclear whether Moscow could really provide such a force, because of its political struggles. Assuming that Moscow cannot, the United States is left with the task of finding the bulk of the additional 30,000 soldiers needed to enforce a possible peace agreement.</p>
        <p>The American assurances were given to Mr. Stoltenberg when he met the Security Council here last week and were repeated by Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the head of NATO's Southern Command, in talks with Mr. Stoltenberg in the Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, on Friday, the diplomats and United Nations officials say.</p>
        <p>The assurances came after a letter sent on Aug. 19 by Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Mr. Izetbegovic, urging him to accept the peace plan and saying the United States stands ready to help put it into effect.</p>
        <p>BALKAN UPDATE</p>
        <p>As negotiators prepared yesterday to resume peace talks in GENEVA, the leaders of Bosnia's Parliament in SARAJEVO called on the United States and NATO to enforce any peace agreement that might come from the negotiations.</p>
        <p>In NEW YORK, United Nations officials said they have been assured by the Clinton Administration that the United States would provide most of the roughly 30,000 new peacekeeping troops needed to enforce any such agreement.</p>
        <p>In MADRID, Muslim representatives from MOSTAR failed to show up at talks with United Nations and Croatian officials aimed at releasing 52 Spanish peacekeepers trapped in MOSTAR.</p>
