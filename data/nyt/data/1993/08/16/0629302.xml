        <p>"Hollywood on Hollywood" is an account of how the movie industry has treated itself on screen from the 1930's to yesterday. That may not be the most exciting idea of the season, but it's not a bad pretext for showing clips from such estimable efforts as "A Star Is Born" (the 1937 and 1954 versions), "Singin' in the Rain," "Sunset Boulevard" and "Sullivan's Travels," not to mention glimpses of Daffy Duck trying to peddle a script, Alan Mowbray becoming agitated as a director with an accent and Gregory Ratoff making like a producer, with a more authentic accent, sighing over the old days when "Even when you turned out a good picture, you made money."</p>
        <p>The hourlong tour begins with scenes from movies about starlets becoming stars and stars throwing tantrums and newsreels of actors and actresses giving their all, approximately, for World War II bond drives. After the war, according to Richard Schickel, who wrote, produced and directed, the business changed and Hollywood turned on itself, as evidenced particularly by a couple of sizzling scenes with Rod Steiger and Shelley Winters from "The Big Knife." Now actresses playing actresses were complaining on screen about what they had to do for producers to get there.</p>

        <p>The sensible narration is delivered by Ron Howard, trying to seem spontaneous. And for distraction, there are Jack Oakie and Jack Haley playing comics, Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Martha Raye on camels and Vera Zorina doing a George Balanchine dance for a dreaming soldier. The documentary brings the story up to date with nods at "Barton Fink," "Grand Canyon" and "The Player." This show may not tell you much that you don't know or care to know, but fans of old flicks are likely to find themselves smiling for most of the hour. 'Big Wave Dave's'  CBS, tonight at 9:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>The first episode of this summer series, which washed up on the screen last week like a foundered flounder, introduced three midlife adolescents as they move from blizzard-beleaguered Chicago to surf-sappy Hawaii. The prospect is for more jokes having to do with their neuroses and the attendant difficulties of adapting to paradise. Adam Arkin, Patrick Breen, David Morse and Jane Kaczmarek (as the take-charge wife of one of these nitwits) work perspiringly to wring some laughs out of their predicament. Back to the surfboard, everybody. Hollywood on Hollywood AMC, tonight at 10 Written, produced and directed by Richard Schickel. Doug Freeman and Peter Wood, co-producers; Philip Hurn, cameraman; Alexandra Rubinstein, production designer; Michael Crouel, art director; sound by John Luisiana; Susan Hoenig, production manager; Sandy Shapiro, executive producer; Ron Howard, host.</p>
