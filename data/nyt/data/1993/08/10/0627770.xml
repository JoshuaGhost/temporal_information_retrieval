        <p>A selection of the world's top young women in chess defeated a group of senior men in a match in late June in Vienna. They thus got revenge for their defeat in the first match of this kind last year, which took place on Aruba in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>The winning team was composed of the former women's world champion, Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia, who was high scorer with 9-3; Zsuzsa Polgar of Hungary; Xie Jun of China, the current women's world champion; Zsofia Polgar of Hungary; Ketevan Arakhamia of Georgia; Alisa Gallyamova of Ukraine. They scored 40 1/2 points to the men's 31 1/2.</p>

        <p>A selection of the world's top young women in chess defeated a group of senior men in a match in late June in Vienna. They thus got revenge for their defeat in the first match of this kind last year, which took place on Aruba in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>The winning team was composed of the former women's world champion, Maya Chiburdanidze of Georgia, who was high scorer with 9-3; Zsuzsa Polgar of Hungary; Xie Jun of China, the current women's world champion; Zsofia Polgar of Hungary; Ketevan Arakhamia of Georgia; Alisa Gallyamova of Ukraine. They scored 40 1/2 points to the men's 31 1/2.</p>
        <p>The losers were Bent Larsen of Denmark, men's high scorer with 7 1/24 1/2; Vasily Smyslov of Russia, a former world champion; Efim Geller of Russia; Borislav Ivkov of Yugoslavia; Fridrik Olafsson of Iceland, and Andreas Duckstein of Austria.</p>
        <p>In the match, organized by Joop van Oosterom of the Netherlands, each player contested two games with each member of the opposing team.</p>
        <p>Chiburdanidze gave a nice demonstration of her attacking skill at the expense of Larsen in Round 5.</p>
        <p>Chiburdanidze's unorthodox 7 Qe2!? in this Sicilian Defense prepared for early queenside castling and pressure on the d line.</p>
        <p>On 11 Nc5!?, Larsen evidently judged that 11 . . . Bc8 12 g4 b6 13 Nb3 Be6 14 g5 Nh5 15 Rg1 Nf4 16 Bf4 ef 17 h4 would be in White's favor. After his 11 . . . a6, Chiburdanidze obtained the bishop-pair with 12 Ne6 fe and planned operations against the doubled e pawns.</p>
        <p>Larsen could not storm the center with 14 . . . d5? because 15 Bh3 Qd6 16 Be6! Qe6 17 ed Qc8 18 dc Qc6 19 Bg5 would leave him a pawn down.</p>
        <p>Chiburdanidze attacked on the light squares with the sharp 16 f5! This thrust permitted Larsen to counterattack with 16 . . . Qa5!? 17 fe!? b4 18 Qc4!? bc 19 e7 d5 20 ef/Q Rf8 21 Qc6 Qa2, but he refused the opportunity, perhaps because he considered that Chiburdanidze could have exposed it as unsound with 22 bc Qa3 23 Kd2 Ne4 24 Kd3.</p>
        <p>The Dane's alternative, 16 . . . b4, let Chiburdanidze regroup strongly with 17 Na4 Qa5 (17 . . . Ne4?! 18 fe Qa5 19 Qc4 Nd4 20 Rd4! ed 21 e7 d5 22 ef/Q Rf8 23 Qd4 Qa4 24 Be6! Kh8 25 Bd5 Nf6 26 Ba8 Ra8 27 Kb1 puts White a pawn ahead while denying Black any counterplay) 18 b3. On 18 . . . Qb5 (18 . . . Ne4? was now to be punished by 19 Bb6 Nc3 20 Qh5 Qb5 21 Bf1, which traps the black queen) 19 Qf3, Larsen could not play 19 . . . d5? because of 20 fe Ne4 21 Qf7 Kh8 22 Bf1 Qb8 23 Rd5.</p>
        <p>Larsen aimed for counterplay with 20 . . . Nd4, hoping for 21 Bd4?! ed 22 Rd4 Qe5 23 Rhd1 g6 24 Bh3 Ne4 25 Bg2 d5. Chiburdanidze, however, crossed him up with a nice sacrifice of rook for knight with 21 Rd4! ed 22 Bd4, after which the white pieces dominated the position and, of course, she had gotten a pawn and a powerful initiative.</p>
        <p>She quickly launched a mating attack with 26 g4! Larsen, following the classical rule that a wing attack should be met with a break in the center, fought back with 26 . . . d5, but it was too late. Chiburdanidze's 27 Qh3! prepared to answer 27 . . . dc? by 28 Bf6 h6 29 Qh6.</p>
        <p>After 27 . . . h6 28 Ne5, it was clear that Chiburdanidze's attack could not be repulsed: every one of the white minor pieces was aimed at the black king. Larsen desperately tried 28 . . . Bc5, but Chiburdanidze would certainly not permit the exchange of her killer QB for its ineffective black counterpart.</p>
        <p>After 30 g5!, the Black king position was disintegrating. Larsen played 30 . . . Ne4 and Chiburdanidze delivered the coup-de-grace with 31 Qh6! gh 32 Nf7 Kg8 33 Nh6 mate. SICILIAN DEFENSE</p>
