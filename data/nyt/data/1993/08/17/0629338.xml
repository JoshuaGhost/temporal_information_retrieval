        <p>You could say Elias Mahlangu, who was pulled from his van on July 10 and shot through the head with his own pistol, was a casualty of market forces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahlangu was an aspiring taxi operator in the sleepy black township of Atteridgeville, near Pretoria, a newcomer to a business that was, not long ago, a black South African's quickest route to the capitalist class.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, when van taxis surpassed buses and trains as the main form of black transportation, they were celebrated as the first flowering of black entrepreneurship that would create a new middle class and help subdue revolutionary fever.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, taxis have become fixtures in the daily havoc of South Africa, associated more with gruesome death than golden opportunity. As the carnage in black townships clouds South Africa's transition to democracy, the taxi industry is a reminder that much of what the world calls political violence is inextricable from the battle for economic survival.</p>
        <p>In a suffocating economy, the taxi business has become a cutthroat industry with its own rules and its own savage culture of enforcement. Mr. Mahlangu violated one of the rules -- his fleet of six taxis was secretly owned by a group of white businessmen -- and as a taxi leader explained offhandedly, he was subject to the industry's abrupt methods of self-regulation.</p>
        <p>"They killed the man," said Mike Ntlatleng, an official of the South African Black Taxi Association, whose members admitted the attack. "Then they handed themselves over to police. That's how noble it is to kill such people." Sometimes a Trigger Of Township War</p>
        <p>Sometimes taxi conflicts are the trigger of township warfare. Rival black taxi associations are engaged in fierce turf battles in half a dozen major communities and many lesser settlements, competing for market share with shootings, firebomb ambushes and paid assassins who make little distinction between operator and passenger.</p>
        <p>Although most taxi operators strive to remain politically neutral, a driver's tribe or neighborhood of residence can mark him in the rumor market as a partisan, so taxi wars set off wider political violence.</p>
        <p>More often taxis are simply convenient targets for crime, vendetta or political terror. The worst horrors of black South Africans, it seems, are played out in taxis.</p>
        <p>One day it was the story of 5-year-old Mzulizi Mashobane, who watched his parents incinerated when their van taxi was set alight by a rampaging Zulu mob. His mother managed to toss the boy out the window.</p>
        <p>Another day it was the account of Petrus Zungu, the lone survivor of seven Zulu migrant workers who were ordered from their taxi by armed men, interrogated about their tribe and political party, forced to lie on the ground and, one by one, shot in the back.</p>
        <p>"The two main sources of killing in this country are political affiliation and taxi associations," said Samkelo Kumalo, editor of the industry newsletter Taxi Talk. "Sometimes it is impossible to tell which is which."</p>
        <p>The taxi industry began as an illicit stepchild of apartheid, and later fell into official favor.</p>
        <p>When the white Government banished blacks to remote homeland ghettos and black townships, it subsidized buses and trains to deliver them to their jobs in white South Africa.</p>
        <p>To protect its transport monopoly and prevent blacks from gaining a permanent economic foothold, the Government discouraged black taxis with a welter of daunting regulations.</p>
        <p>The first drivers were men like Thomas Maake, who started 30 years ago with a sedan and a license he bought illegally from a friend who met the Government's requirements.</p>
        <p>"I am what I am because of apartheid," Mr. Maake said with a laugh, meaning a master of loopholes. He now has a fleet of 30 taxis in Atteridgeville.</p>
        <p>The Government's change of heart was reflected in a 1984 report, which said black businessmen were less likely to be political revolutionaries and called for the relaxation of all measures restricting their development.</p>
        <p>Prodded by the increasingly powerful black taxi association, the Government legalized the 16-passenger van taxis that are now the industry standard, and issued a blizzard of permits. Banks joined informal township savings associations in offering credit for new taxi entrepreneurs. By the end of the decade, the taxi industry was being hailed by one economist as "the flagship of the informal sector."</p>
        <p>Taxi drivers took business from the buses and trains by undercutting fares, serving more flexible routes and offering customers the satisfaction of patronizing black business. Van Taxis Total At Least 80,000</p>
        <p>The taxi industry, which comprised a few hundred six-seat sedans in the late 1970's, is now estimated at anywhere from 80,000 vans to nearly twice that many, perhaps half of them unlicensed pirate cabs.</p>
        <p>"What's the old saying, 'Have gun, will travel?' " said Daniel J. Rossouw, the chairman of a commission that has been investigating taxi violence since early last year. "The moment you've got a car, if you dare, you travel -- no license, no driver test, no insurance."</p>
        <p>Only one black South African in 100 owns a car -- compared with one out of two whites -- so taxis are indispensable.</p>
        <p>Black taxis pack in riders at designated pickup points, leaving when full and charging a fixed rate. The fare for the heavily traveled route from Soweto to downtown Johannesburg, for instance, is the equivalent of about 50 cents. In rush hour they race at speeds that have earned them both a reputation for being suicidal and the nickname Zola Budds, after South Africa's Olympic distance runner. In off-peak hours, drivers troll slowly for passengers, honking at street corners and clogging downtown traffic.</p>
        <p>Taxis bring migrant laborers from Zululand and street vendors from Zimbabwe. They deliver children to school and fans to soccer matches.</p>
        <p>In South Africa, blacks live by the taxi, and with harrowing regularity, they die by the taxi.</p>
        <p>The recession that hit South African in 1990 afflicted the taxi industry with rising costs and declining ridership.</p>
        <p>In part because of trade sanctions against the apartheid Government, a van that cost $10,000 in 1987 costs about $25,000 today. At the same time, layoffs in industry have meant fewer passengers commuting to work. And community pressures have prevented fares from rising.</p>
        <p>To meet their bank payments, taxi owners push their drivers to meet impossible quotas, said Mphikeleli Sibanyoni, an organizer for the fledgling South African Taxi Drivers Union, which has 9,000 members.</p>
        <p>Drivers, who are paid $250 for a month of 14- to 18-hour days, are encouraged to overload their cabs, ignore speed limits, skip safety inspections, drive weary, and yield no ground to competitors, he said.</p>
        <p>"When the owners go to war, it is the drivers who die," Mr. Sibanyoni said.</p>
        <p>Aside from legalizing black taxis, the Government has paid them litle attention, said Meshack Khosa, a University of Natal lecturer who has studied the industry. Instead, the industry regulates itself through a network of taxi associations, which control access to taxi stops and organize patrols to enforce the rules.</p>
        <p>Although many drivers and some economists say the industry should be under the control of Government regulation and union bargaining, opposition parties have not shown any interest in taking up that cause. The major black groups, the African National Congress and the Inkatha Freedom Party, have had little to say about taxi violence except to blame each other for it. Regulation By Violence</p>
        <p>At the outset, taxi wars are usually variations on the theme of unregulated competition.</p>
        <p>In Soweto, where a taxi feud has been killing drivers at the rate of one a day, the fight began with a rift in the leadership of the taxi association. The breakaway group decided to lower fares, and the war was on.</p>
        <p>In Brits, taxi operators say, the problem was a group of retired black policemen who bought taxis and then tried to muscle in on the local association. One of the newcomers was convicted of murder last month after he sprayed a taxi line with gunfire.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Mahlangu in Atteridgeville, drivers in other places have been killed because competitors suspected they were fronts for white investors.</p>
        <p>Black operators contend that whites have unfair advantages, like easier financing, cheaper insurance rates, and a more sympathetic relationship with the police. White owners, they point out, already control most of the more conventional, metered taxicab fleets that serve the airports and other destinations of the more affluent.</p>
        <p>In the absence of more conventional regulation, taxi disputes are settled in the tradition of the wild frontier, by means that can be lethally modern or monstrously old-fashioned.</p>
        <p>"They used to fight with knobkerries," Mr. Ntlatleng said of the taxi association, referring to the ceremonial clubs carried by many Africans. "Then it was guns. Now they get professional assassins."</p>
        <p>Howard Mboweni, a Pretoria lawyer who often represents taxi operators, said that last year he helped mediate a dispute between rival associations in a rural area of the northeastern Transvaal where taxi drivers were killing children for body parts to be used in concocting magic war potions. Factional Feuds Widen Conflict</p>
        <p>Once a taxi war starts, one faction may solicit protection from a political party, widening the conflict. More often, the feuds become political by circumstance.</p>
        <p>Zulu drivers who ply the routes between Natal and the Johannesburg area, for instance, often reside with their passengers in migrant hostels here. As the hostels have been colonized by Inkatha, drivers have felt compelled to join the party for protection -- or even if they do not join, the surrounding community assumes they support Inkatha.</p>
        <p>In the battle-torn township of Katlehong, east of Johannesburg, the center of recent factional violence that has engendered much despair about the country's future, rival taxi associations have fought off and on for about five years, since an association of young drivers broke away from an older group based in the hostels.</p>
        <p>"The perception was that the newer Katlehong Taxi Association represented 'the community,' where the old Germiston Taxi Association represented the Zulus who lived in the hostels," said Mr. Khosa, who spent six months investigating the township's taxi wars.</p>
        <p>Young township militants stoned and burned some of the Zulu drivers, who retaliated in February 1990 by attacking a high school. The ensuing war lasted for about two weeks and killed about 50 people.</p>
        <p>"What began as a taxi war engulfed the entire community," Mr. Khosa said. "It appeared on the surface that the A.N.C. was fighting Inkatha, when the reality was much more complicated." Riding With Fear And Suspicion</p>
        <p>For passengers, the journeys that were a wearying consequence of apartheid are now attended by fear and suspicion.</p>
        <p>"Before you get in a taxi now, you look around at the people inside, and you listen to what languages they speak," said Seipati Letsatsi, a Katlehong woman who spends four hours each day commuting by taxi to and from a teacher training course.</p>
        <p>Fearful of riding after dark, passengers say they show up late for work and leave early to get off the roads by dusk. At times of upheaval, many miss work.</p>
        <p>More than ambushes and abductions, Andries Mokhati said he worries about hanging on to his job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mokhati, a stranded Katlehong resident, had missed several days of his job at a shipping company because his taxi refused to run the gantlet of barricades. Asked if he wasn't afraid of the taxis, he gave a melancholy nod, but added, "I'm more afraid of no taxis."</p>
