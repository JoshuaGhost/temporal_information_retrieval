        <p>Pro Bowl running back Rodney Hampton has checked into camp and the Giants couldn't be happier. But how happy is Hampton?</p>
        <p>"I'm in camp, but I'm still not a happy camper," he said. "But hopefully in a couple of days, you'll see a big smile on Rodney Hampton's face."</p>
        <p>Hampton is not without a contract -- he is scheduled to be paid $425,000 this season -- but many football observers agree that Hampton, considered one of the top three running backs in the National Football League, is drastically underpaid.</p>
        <p>Hampton's appearance means a temporary truce has been called between the two sides and a new contract will probably be forthcoming within the next several days. The Giants wanted to see what kind of shape Hampton was in before they gave him the raise, and Hampton's appearance is a good-faith move on his part.</p>
        <p>Hampton had been out of camp for 13 days and was fined a total of $52,000.</p>
        <p>"I did what I had to do to get them to see I was serious about a new contract," Hampton said. His agent, Ralph Cindrich of Pittsburgh, said Hampton's no-show was an "attention getter." Said Cindrich: "He showed up on Friday night and told the coaches that his attitude was good, that he was upbeat, and he was ready to play."</p>
        <p>As of several months ago, the top five running backs in the league made on average about $1.7 million a year. Thurman Thomas, Buffalo's superb running back, recently signed a four-year, $13.5 million deal to make him the highest paid running back in the league. For now. The Cowboys' Emmitt Smith is currently holding out and wants more money than Thomas (actually he wants about $4 million a season).</p>
        <p>Right now, the highest paid player in the N.F.L. is San Francisco quarterback Steve Young, who makes over $5 million a year.</p>
        <p>The debate around the league focuses on the questions: Is a running back worth that kind of money?  Where will Hampton's salary end up? Right now, it's unclear, but when all is said and done, he will be much richer than now. He's earned it.</p>
        <p>Hampton, a 1990 first-round draft pick, has rushed for 1,000 yards in each of the past two seasons, making him only the second Giants player to do so (Joe Morris was the other in 1985 and 1986). He has 2,655 career rushing yards in just three seasons, already good enough for the No. 8 spot on the Giants' career list. And this is only his fourth season.</p>
        <p>Last year he led the team with 1,141 yards and made the Pro Bowl. His 14 rushing touchdowns for the season tied him for the second best in club history. Hampton also had two 100-yard games last year and against Phoenix rushed for a career-high 167 yards on 21 carries.</p>
        <p>Hampton is the kind of runner Coach Dan Reeves never had in all his successful years in Denver -- a big, bruising back with great power and great speed. He figures to be a vital part of the offense, which is why Reeves has been so desperate to get him in camp.</p>
        <p>Currently, Hampton isn't even listed on the team's depth chart and for the scrimmage on Saturday, Lewis Tillman was the starting running back. That will change. Fast. As soon as the Giants feel he's ready, Hampton will be in the starting lineup. Reeves has expressed concern about putting him there too soon and risking injury, so they won't throw him into the fire immediately.</p>
        <p>As for his conditioning, Hampton said he was angry at reports that there was a concern among the coaching staff that he was overweight. Hampton said he's 230 pounds -- only about 5 pounds overweight. His listed playing weight is 215 pounds.</p>
        <p>Whatever, the main thing for the Giants is that Hampton is here. The team is slowly beginning to fall into place. With Hampton's arrival, only two players are out of camp with contracts: offensive tackle Jumbo Elliott and defensive lineman Mike Fox. Both appear to be close to reporting. EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The team had another full-contact scrimmage that featured some of the best hitting of the camp, highlighted by linebacker PEPPER JOHNSON cracking DAVE MEGGETT in the chest when the running back tried to make a catch across the middle. Quarterback PHIL SIMMS was 5 of 10 for 31 yards and LAWRENCE TAYLOR had two sacks. The only casualty was running back LEWIS TILLMAN, who bruised his right shoulder. . . . Defensive end GEORGE ROOKS, who left camp on Thursday, was waived today. . . . National Football League Player's Association figures show a big increase in some Giants veterans' salaries. Salary figures for tight end HOWARD CROSS, safety MYRON GUYTON, safety THOM KAUMEYER, offensive lineman BRIAN WILLIAMS and kicker KEN WILLIS showed a combined average salary that increased from $383,000 in 1992 to $597,000 this year (an increase of 55.9 percent). A group of 11 players in a higher-salary group, including LAWRENCE TAYLOR, PHIL SIMMS, MIKE SHERRARD, CARLTON BAILEY and MICHAEL BROOKS, showed an increase of 83.3 percent, from $732,000 in 1992 to almost $1.342 million. Punter SEAN LANDETA, according to the figures, went from making $400,000 in 1992 to $1.2 million in 1993.</p>
