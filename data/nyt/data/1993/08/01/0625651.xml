        <p>Time was when flannel-clad collegians headed for campus with a tennis racket and ukulele. Today, portable stereos top the list of extracurricular paraphernalia, and students preparing to return to school are pondering options in carry-along sound gear.</p>
        <p>Leaving aside various species of the Walkman, which can be heard only with earphones, the boom box is the most popular choice for portable sound. The better models have advanced far beyond the notorious noisemakers of yesteryear, and the best of them don't even boom. Even so, they still have limitations. Luciano Pavarotti in full voice might rattle a boom box, and symphonic onslaughts leave them shaken. But they do well with jazz and pop, and there is something to be said for a complete stereo system that can be picked up by a handle.</p>

        <p>Time was when flannel-clad collegians headed for campus with a tennis racket and ukulele. Today, portable stereos top the list of extracurricular paraphernalia, and students preparing to return to school are pondering options in carry-along sound gear.</p>
        <p>Leaving aside various species of the Walkman, which can be heard only with earphones, the boom box is the most popular choice for portable sound. The better models have advanced far beyond the notorious noisemakers of yesteryear, and the best of them don't even boom. Even so, they still have limitations. Luciano Pavarotti in full voice might rattle a boom box, and symphonic onslaughts leave them shaken. But they do well with jazz and pop, and there is something to be said for a complete stereo system that can be picked up by a handle.</p>
        <p>The remarkably compact Sharp WQ-CH600 is the first boom box to contain a CD changer capable of holding six disks, which allows as many as 32 selections to be programmed in advance. It also has a double cassette deck for tape-to-tape copying. To limit the price to $249, Sharp opted for an analog radio tuner -- with a rotary knob -- rather than costlier digital push-button tuning.</p>
        <p>Another superior boom box is Panasonic's RX-DT707 ($450), which contains a CD player, a dual cassette deck, a digital radio tuner and an amplifier that lends punch and credibility to medium lows, if not deep bass. No less than four speakers project sound that makes few concessions to portability.</p>
        <p>Given the sonic constraints of even a hefty jukebox, listeners with a penchant for orchestral music are better served by table-top systems. These models cope adequately with symphonic sound, though not as convincingly as a full-size home installation. Yet they are compact enough to lug to and from school in a car trunk. Some may even be stashed under an airplane seat. Each system consists of three parts: two speakers and a central unit housing the tuner, amplifier, CD player and tape deck. With any kind of music, such mini-systems attain a level of fidelity that makes attentive listening a pleasure.</p>
        <p>A clear standout in this group is Denon's D-60 ($800), whose CD player uses elaborate digital filters similar to those in full-size home systems. Onkyo's PCS-30 ($699), the JVC MX-C5 ($800), the Technics SC-CH455 ($650) and Yamaha's CC-70W ($799) are also successful in combining good sound with small size.</p>
        <p>One maverick table-top design is the Bose Acoustic Wave Music System. Contained within a single ivory-colored enclosure with not a single knob showing (the controls are greatly simplified), this model doesn't even look like a stereo system. More important, in sonic power and range, it comes close to that of full-size stereo equipment.</p>
        <p>This exceptional performance is the handiwork of Dr. Amar Bose of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who mathematically analyzed resonant spaces to create a chamber resembling an organ pipe. But while an organ pipe produces only a single note, the Bose version extends the resonance of the pipe evenly over five octaves. Linking such a pipe to a loudspeaker reinforces the lower part of the musical range.</p>
        <p>What's more, the seven-foot pipe is curled up into a kind of pretzel and packed inside a box measuring only 18-by-11-by-8 inches, reconciling the contradictory requirements of low bass and small size. There was even room left in the box for the stereo amplifier, the radio tuner and CD player. Connections are provided for an optional tape deck.</p>
        <p>The entire system can be carried in a fitted canvas bag, and since it runs on batteries as well as house current, it plays anywhere. Priced at $997, it is not sold in stores but can be obtained for a two-week trial by calling 1-800-282-BOSE.</p>
