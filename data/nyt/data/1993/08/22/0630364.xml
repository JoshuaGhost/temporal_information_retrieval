        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Angered by Japan's Barriers, U.S. Apple Growers Retaliate" (front page, Aug. 17):</p>
        <p>As anyone who has visited Tokyo knows, shopkeepers treat their fruit like individual objects of display. Peaches and cantaloupe are neatly wrapped in tissue paper and fastened in protective boxes, so that they are not bruised. Strawberries, glossy red and blemish-free, are arranged like rows of soldiers in decorative plastic boxes. Grapes are firm, attached to their stems and, as they are immaculately washed, free of residue.</p>
        <p>The flavor of the fruit in Japan is also superb, appropriately sweet and juicy, almost never bland or sour.</p>
        <p>A trip to the produce section of a local supermarket or deli in the United States offers a completely different experience. With the exception of a few minor exotic fruits, such as the golden red apples from New Zealand or Fiji and possibly apricots, most fruits -- apples, pears, lemons, oranges, pineapples -- look as if they had been dumped in their bins and are often discolored and bruised.</p>
        <p>Also, in contrast to the fruit in Japan, they are not always flavorful. Oranges are sometimes sour or juiceless; apples are often lacking in crispness or taste.</p>
        <p>As I read your article, I could not help being reminded of the extraordinary quality of fruit in Japan. It is no wonder the Japanese impose high standards on the fruit they allow into the country. Simply put, it would be a disgrace not to.  ERIKA SHIMAHARA  New York, Aug. 17, 1993</p>
