        <p>In his latest novel set in turn-of-the-century Cairo, Michael Pearce introduces us to a gorilla of a man. He is the bodyguard of a pasha, and he represents the old virtues. So when he goes into battle it is with the bubbling happiness and invention of Rossini writing "Il Barbiere di Siviglia." He gets into a fight, merely doing his duty, and when Capt. Cadwallader Owen, the Mamur Zapt, comes upon him, he is holding something in his hand:</p>
        <p>" 'What's that you're holding?'</p>
        <p>"The man looked down at his hands sheepishly. He showed the thing to Owen. A head.</p>
        <p>" 'It seems to have come off,' he said."</p>
        <p>The Mamur Zapt, in the Egypt of British rule, was the officer in charge of the political division of the secret police. Mr. Pearce chronicles Captain Owen's further exploits in THE MAMUR ZAPT AND THE MEN BEHIND (Mysterious Press/ Warner, $17.95).</p>
        <p>It is the fourth of the series, and every bit as good as its predecessors. The first, "The Mamur Zapt and the Return of the Carpet" (1990), was something new of its kind: part travelogue, part espionage tale, part police procedural, animated by a delicate sense of humor and a bringing to life of a vanished period. The book was delightful, and Mr. Pearce, using much the same formula for its successors, has kept up the good work.</p>
        <p>This new one is more strictly a procedural than the earlier novels, though there is no keeping the author's spirits down. He is a bit of a deadpan absurdist. Take the conversation between Owen and a vagabond, a most attractive woman with whom he becomes associated -- in the line of duty, of course. She approaches him in a cafe and invites him to her apartment:</p>
        <p>" 'That would be very nice,' he said. 'However, I am working.'</p>
        <p>" 'In the cafe? You are like my man. He sits in the cafe drinking tea when he should be stealing.' "</p>
        <p>Scenes like this are hard to resist. There is also an interesting story line. The Khedive cannot make up his mind who his new prime minister will be. There is unrest in Cairo. Various unethical pashas jockey for position. British officials are followed and in some cases shot at. An explosion in a cafe kills students. Owen and his staff have to infiltrate the revolutionary world of the law and engineering colleges before the perpetrators can be caught.</p>
        <p>The novel has its serious moments, but most of it is built on wonderful character sketches. The writing is so urbane and civilized that it makes almost every other practitioner sound thick and unimaginative. Mr. Pearce has something very individual to offer. May he thrive.</p>
        <p>Two books with more or less standard plots illustrate the difference between a seasoned pro and an amateur. Jack Higgins, the author of "The Eagle Has Landed" and many other thrillers, is represented by THUNDER POINT (Putnam, $22.95). The other is a first novel, THE POTSDAM PROTOCOL, by Al Clovis (Lone Tree, $22.95).</p>
        <p>In both novels there is a hero who takes on all kinds of crazy odds. But no matter how farfetched the character of Sean Dillon in "Thunder Point" may be, he does typify the strong, silent man who is lethal when he swings into action. And Mr. Higgins knows how to tell a story. It's a good one, involving the escape of Martin Bormann from Berlin in the last days of the Third Reich and the discovery in the Caribbean of a shipwreck, a German U-boat containing a deadly secret that both the British Government and an evil billionaire desperately want. "Thunder Point" is escapist reading, of course, and what's wrong with that when done on this level of expertise?</p>
        <p>"The Potsdam Protocol," on the other hand, is wordy, poorly written and full of caricatures. There is a neo-Nazi assassin of spectacular ineptitude. Time after time he and his crew try to kill a retired United States Air Force colonel, and every time they goof. It's like a Tom and Jerry cartoon. The dialogue is as stiff as an 1890's boiled shirt, and the ending passeth understanding.</p>
        <p>The cold war provides the backdrop for BROTHERS, by Michael Bar-Zohar (Fawcett Columbine, $21). The lives of two half brothers are traced from 1953 to 1991. They are born in Moscow, one of a Jewish mother and father, the other of the same mother but a gentile father. The Jewish father, a writer and intellectual, is picked up during Stalin's purges and disappears.</p>
        <p>An aunt manages to flee to New York with one of the boys. He grows up to be a Russian scholar and becomes a C.I.A. agent. The other boy, ruthless and ambitious, is taken into the K.G.B., where he makes a great name for himself. Eventually the two meet, mostly because of C.I.A. machinations. Something happens that makes them hate each other. There is a convulsive final encounter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bar-Zohar, an Israeli, has given the reader all the action one could desire. At the end he comes up with a philosophical twist that is, perhaps, rather melodramatic, but no less cogent for that. This tightly organized look back at the cold war and the chilling amorality of two of its leading players -- the K.G.B. and the C.I.A. -- is a deft piece of work.</p>
        <p>The veteran Brian Freemantle, in THE BUTTON MAN (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $22.95), has his stylistic quirks, though one actually comes to look forward to them and even relish their turning up. Mr. Freemantle goes through literary contortions to avoid the "he said" locution. Thus we have sentences like:</p>
        <p>" 'Everything annoys him,' dismissed Danilov."</p>
        <p>" 'Probably,' Cowley accepted."</p>
        <p>" 'No,' deflated Cowley."</p>
        <p>And, unforgettably:</p>
        <p>" 'You mean there's more?' snatched Danilov."</p>
        <p>"The Button Man" is about a serial killer in Moscow who knocks off the niece of an important (but hateful) United States senator, clips her hair and cuts the buttons from her clothes. An honest, efficient Russian cop is on the case. Working with him is an American from the F.B.I. There is some tension between the two, they chase false leads, they learn to respect each other, and they finally find the culprit, whose identity will be no surprise to the experienced reader. It's all good fun, and fans of Mr. Freemantle will rejoice.</p>
