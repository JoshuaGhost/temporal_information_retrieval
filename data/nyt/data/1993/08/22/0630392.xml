        <p>THE General Motors Corporation, which was once the envy of the industrial world, is now trying to prove that it isn't the patsy of the automotive industry anymore.</p>
        <p>In Europe, the company is waging a legal and public relations assault on a former executive it accuses of passing secrets to Volkswagen A.G. Back home, its aggressive reaction to a report that one of its pickup trucks was prone to burst into flames helped lead to the resignation of a network news chief.</p>
        <p>Such assertiveness is a new face for G.M. Throughout the 1980's, it was ridiculed by Wall Street as a blundering giant and badgered by both consumer watchdogs and car lovers. A documentary lampooning the company and its chairman, "Roger and Me," played theaters usually reserved for feature films.</p>
        <p>Until recently, G.M.'s usual response to criticism had been a hasty recall, a terse press release or a quiet financial settlement. It often assumed a facade of icy stoicism, seeming to imply that it was too rich and powerful to stoop to its adversary's level.</p>
        <p>How times change. "We are being much more direct and straightforward than ever before, especially if we think General Motors has been wronged," said Bruce G. MacDonald, vice president of the automaker's communications staff.</p>
        <p>Billions in losses and the removal of chairman Robert C. Stempel in 1992 helped shatter the hauteur. Only two weeks ago, G.M.'s Saturn subsidiary was forced to recall cars for the eighth time in its short history to repair faulty electrical systems.</p>
        <p>In November, NBC Dateline broadcast a story saying that some G.M. pickups' gas tanks exploded when hit from the side. The automaker swung into action, assembling a team of experts who dissected the videotape and showed that the explosion captured on screen had been rigged, ignited with the help of little rockets beneath the gas tank. NBC News publicly apologized and its president, Michael Gartner, resigned shortly afterward.</p>
        <p>Since then, op-ed page columns and letters to editors suggest that G.M. swayed public opinion in its favor. And the company came up with an uncharacteristically creative settlement offer to class-action suits by owners of those pickups: $1,000 coupons toward the purchase of a new G.M. truck or van.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, when a journalist erroneously reported that the general manager of Chevrolet was to be fired, Mr. MacDonald said, the general manager and other top G.M. executives flew to the East Coast to refute the story in a meeting with the reporter and editors. The Volkswagen Scandal</p>
        <p>Aggressive tactics also seem to have helped in a major scandal -- the one G.M. has faced in Europe.</p>
        <p>In March, just after Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, one of the company's rising stars, deserted to Volkswagen A.G. in the middle of an embarrassingly public power struggle, G.M. accused him of stealing trade secrets and asked both German and American prosecutors to pursue the case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lopez and seven executives who went with him were accused of stealing documents about the design of a new Opel -- G.M.'s German subsidiary -- and documents listing prices G.M. paid for parts.</p>
        <p>In one sense, the whole affair is a corporate comic opera. In today's world of joint ventures and creeping technological change, there are few automotive secrets worth stealing -- and if there are any, G.M. isn't thought to have them. The price lists Mr. Lopez is accused of carrying off, for example, could be put together fairly accurately by other means. Efficient manufacturing techniques he is supposed to have purloined are no more than variants on ideas that others have articulated.</p>
        <p>In the past, had any G.M. executive other than Mr. Lopez been suspected of defecting with sensitive documents, the automaker almost certainly would have pursued the matter quietly, inquiring whether the material was taken by mistake.</p>
        <p>But this is now. And Mr. Lopez was no ordinary G.M. executive. After saving the company hundreds of millions by squeezing lower prices from European suppliers, he publicly humiliated its president, John F. Smith Jr., by quitting just hours before he was to be named head of North American operations. He said he quit because he was frustrated that G.M. wouldn't build an ultra-modern plant near his hometown in Spain's Basque region; he thought V.W. might.</p>
        <p>Since the start of the criminal investigation, G.M. executives quietly have been sharing their evidence with European magazines. The tactic has worked beautifully. The press sensation, replete with tales of shredded documents and police raids, has led to a political uproar in Germany that threatens to topple V.W.'s leadership.</p>
        <p>V.W.'s chairman, Ferdinand Piech, has managed to bollix his defense of Volkswagen and Mr. Lopez by uttering unsupported accusations and contradicting himself. First, he said there were no G.M. documents; then he implied G.M. may have planted the documents that German police found in an executive's home or had computer hackers slip G.M. secrets into V.W. computers; finally he acknowledged that other G.M. documents were destroyed but said they weren't significant.</p>
        <p>Hardly shocking was the recent announcement that V.W. is looking for a new public relations chief.</p>
        <p>The opera has a subplot, too, one laced with the intra-corporate ambition and disappointment concerning what many say was a long rivalry between Mr. Lopez and other executives he bypassed on the corporate ladder. By permitting those executives to vilify V.W., Mr. Smith has let them salve their bruised egos.</p>
        <p>German political leaders, tired of the lurid bickering, have called for the affair to be resolved quietly, before it further damages two pillars of the nation's economy.</p>
        <p>But, even if it angers the Germans, some news media executives and critics of the auto industry, G.M.'s new confrontational style may be serving the company well. Besides helping internal morale, which has been sapped by a decade of mistakes and a history of corporate sluggishness, the aggressiveness is sending an unambiguous signal to consumers and investors that the company is finally serious about tackling its problems directly -- in the manner it did when it was an industry leader.
