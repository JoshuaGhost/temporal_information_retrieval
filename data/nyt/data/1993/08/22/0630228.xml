        <p>GARY VOORHEES, who used to shag fly balls in the cow pastures of Marlboro Township in Monmouth County, has watched his hometown change from a rural agricultural center to a pleasant suburban community.</p>
        <p>"When I was young I had a little red wagon that I would pull up and down Main Street, which at the time was the village's only sidewalk," said Mr. Voorhees, who lives in an 1854 farmhouse his grandfather bought in 1921.</p>

        <p>GARY VOORHEES, who used to shag fly balls in the cow pastures of Marlboro Township in Monmouth County, has watched his hometown change from a rural agricultural center to a pleasant suburban community.</p>
        <p>"When I was young I had a little red wagon that I would pull up and down Main Street, which at the time was the village's only sidewalk," said Mr. Voorhees, who lives in an 1854 farmhouse his grandfather bought in 1921.</p>
        <p>Now, nearly 40 years later, many more streets have sidewalks and the cow pastures are houses -- 8,493 of them, with 3,000 more scheduled to be built in the next several years, according to the village's planning board.</p>
        <p>The population, only 6,359 in 1950, reached 27,974 in 1990. Only a handful of working farms remain, and those are rapidly being bought by developers.</p>
        <p>Mayor Matthew Scannapieco, who has made up T-shirts saying, "Keep Marlboro Green: Adopt a Park," is trying to preserve land for recreation. He is negotiating with a Colts Neck developer, whom he declined to name, who hopes to build 120 homes on 300 acres; the Mayor wants 198 acres set aside for either an 18-hole golf course or a park.</p>
        <p>There also have been rumors -- which state officials deny -- that Marlboro State Psychiatric Hospital, the largest of its kind in New Jersey, with 720 patients, is to be closed. If it does, says Mr. Scannapieco, he would like 300 of the hospital's 900 acres preserved for the township.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scannapieco and his five-member Council are trying to cope with growing pains from increasing traffic, shoddy roads and a lack of commuter parking.</p>
        <p>It is often difficult to get past the intersection of Route 79 and Route 520, which runs from the shore to the Middlesex border of Texas Road, because of the heavy traffic. Getting onto Route 9, a major artery, at rush hour can often take five minutes.</p>
        <p>People who live in the vicinity of Ryan and Texas Roads, where the construction of several housing communities has left streets in need of repair, may have to wait several years until the developers finish building and repaving the roads, at no cost to the taxpayers. Patchwork, however, is scheduled for next month, which will make the roads a bit easier to travel.</p>
        <p>Although commuting to New York City is only about an hour and a quarter by train or bus, there are only 448 commuter parking spaces and a long waiting list for permits, which cost $100 a year. No parking spaces have been added in more than 10 years, said Mayor Scannapieco, who took office in 1992.</p>
        <p>Since being elected, he has managed to lease 100 spaces from the Exclusive Shopping Plaza, next to the township's only commuter parking lot, and a 200-space lot is expected to be completed by September. Two proposals, involving a shopping center and the resolution of a wetlands development, could add 600 to 700 commuter parking spaces within the next couple of years, pending approval by the planning board.</p>
        <p>BUT such problems, Mr. Scannapieco and many Marlboro residents say, are a small price to pay to live in the community.</p>
        <p>Settled by the Dutch in the late 1600's, Marlboro got its name from marl, a mixture of clay and shells, discovered on a farm shortly before the Revolutionary War. The material, used primarily as fertilizer, was shipped throughout the state and by boat to New York. During the war, the Pleasant Valley section was often raided by the British for food supplies and livestock.</p>
        <p>Cheryl Hand, a sales representative for Century 21 Mack Morris Iris Lurie on Route 9, said that one-family homes ranged in price from $200,000 to $1 million, with the more expensive homes in the Doran Park, Hornets Nest and Pleasant Valley sections.</p>
        <p>There are four town-house condominium complexes, all just off Route 9, with a total of 1,351 units. According to Ms. Hand, two- and three-bedroom units sell for $89,000 to $170,000.</p>
        <p>The township owns 7 parks, with 15 tennis courts, 8 soccer fields, 7 basketball courts, 6 baseball fields, 4 handball courts and 7 playgrounds for toddlers. Each school also has at least one soccer and baseball field and a few have tennis and handball as well.</p>
        <p>There are two municipal swimming areas: the Marlboro Swim Club, with four pools, from children's to Olympic size, and the township's main park -- the municipal complex -- with two pools for summer camps. A season family membership at Marlboro's Swim Club is $240, with a weekdays-only membership for $190. Summer camp fees run from $90 for two weeks to $200 for six.</p>
        <p>"I have three small children and Marlboro is really a great place to bring them up," said Gary Kaminsky, who moved from Queens six years ago. "Friends of mine who still live in the city say that when they are ready to start a family they're going to do it in a setting like Marlboro."</p>
        <p>Like the Kaminsky family, Marlboro continues to grow.</p>
        <p>Ground is scheduled to be broken within 60 days on a $1.8 million recreation center that is expected to be open next summer. The center, which will have a game and meeting room and an outdoor amphitheater that will hold several hundred people for summer concerts, will be erected on the 130 acres of the Municipal Complex, where there now are government buildings, police headquarters and Board of Education offices.</p>
        <p>A $1 million project to expand the 60,000-volume library began last month and is expected to be completed in 1994. The township hopes to have increased the number of books by 15 to 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Marlboro residents can shop in malls that have banks, video stores, cleaners and mini-markets and in two supermarkets in strip-shopping centers -- Pathmark on Route 9 and A.&amp; P. on the corner of Routes 79 and 520.</p>
        <p>There are no major department stores but the new Freehold Raceway Mall, a five-minute drive south on Route 9, has 1.3 million square feet, 200 shops and food outlets as well as four department stores, Lord &amp; Taylor, J. C. Penny's, Sears and Nordstrom.</p>
        <p>Other than Nardino, an Italian restaurant on Route 520, fine dining is not easy to find in Marlboro.</p>
        <p>"You have to go to the Shore or New York City to find fancy restaurants," Mayor Scannapieco said.</p>
        <p>THE Marlboro Township Public School District, which has five k-6 schools and one 7-8 school, is "one of the best districts in the state," said Dr. William J. Foley, Superintendent of Schools.</p>
        <p>"Our children's test scores and other achievements are an indicator of the superior education that our students receive."</p>
        <p>Grade 3 students scored above the state average in every subject in the California Achievement Test in 1990-91. In reading, for example, they scored 99.2 compared with the state's 96.2, and in math they scored 91.9, compared with 89.4.</p>
        <p>Enrollment is about 3,900, with a staff of 300 certified teachers and 20 administrators. The curriculum provides for skill development in language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, health, music, art and physical education. There are programs for the intellectually gifted at every level, as well as basic skills instruction for students deficient in reading, writing and math.</p>
        <p>The district has one computer for every eight children in each building, and at least one guidance counselor is assigned to each school.</p>
        <p>Marlboro High School is part of the Freehold Regional High School District, which covers 198.6 square miles of Monmouth County, including Colts Neck, Freehold Borough Freehold Regional, Howell, Farmingdale, Englishtown and Manalapan.</p>
        <p>The majority of its students attend Marlboro High School, 96 percent of whose seniors go on to higher education, according to Dr. Harvey L. Casey, the school's principal. Average class size for the high school is 25 and its graduating class is usually around 430.</p>
