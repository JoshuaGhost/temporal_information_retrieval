        <p>The committee chairman, William Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves, declined to identify the remaining candidates but said: "We all hope Bud Selig would reconsider, but he maintains his position.

        <p>On the first anniversary of Fay Vincent's forced resignation as baseball commissioner, the chairman of the committee still seeking Vincent's successor said today that six to eight people remain on the list of candidates.</p>
        <p>The committee chairman, William Bartholomay of the Atlanta Braves, declined to identify the remaining candidates but said: "We all hope Bud Selig would reconsider, but he maintains his position. He has extraordinary support from all aspects of ownership. The committee wouldn't be continuing if he was willing to go on."</p>
        <p>Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, has served as acting commissioner -- in his role as chairman of the major league executive council -- for the past year. But he has steadfastly refused to accept a draft from an increasing number of owners to take the job on a permanent basis.</p>
        <p>Bartholomay said the six-to-eight list could change, with one or more candidates dropping off and others possibly being added. But he said the committee would spend "much more time" interviewing and checking the candidates currently on the list.</p>
        <p>"I think we're on a fast course," Bartholomay said at the Four Seasons Hotel, where the owners are meeting this week. "I would expect we'll be done by the end of the year."</p>
        <p>Another committee chairman, John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, talked minutes later about the proposal to expand the playoffs and realign each league into three divisions. He was on his way to discussing the matter with the executive council.</p>
        <p>Harrington said the owners and the Players Association had "a short window" in which to reach agreement on the two-pronged alteration of the major leagues' format. They have had only one negotiating meeting and one conference call on the status of proposed changes.</p>
        <p>"We'd have to come out of here Thursday with an understanding on three divisions," Harrington said of the owners. "We should have it crystallized within three or four weeks if we want to do it for next season."</p>
        <p>If the owners, who overwhelmingly favor three-division play, reject the idea for next season, the expanded playoffs would most likely have to be put on hold, too, because the union has said it would not approve the addition of two teams in each league to post-season play without going to three divisions.</p>
