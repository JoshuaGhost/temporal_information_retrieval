        <p>President Clinton's health plan will call for a new Government program to help finance long-term care for people with severe disabilities, regardless of their age or income, Administration officials said today.</p>

        <p>President Clinton's health plan will call for a new Government program to help finance long-term care for people with severe disabilities, regardless of their age or income, Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>The program would help pay for medical and social services that disabled people receive in their own homes, in adult day-care programs and at other sites outside nursing homes. The program would not cover services in a nursing home or an institution for the mentally retarded.</p>
        <p>The plan is intended, in part, to meet the needs of elderly people, who already have coverage for hospital care and doctors' services under Medicare.  By proposing the new benefit, Mr. Clinton increases the chances that he will win support from the elderly for his overall health care plan.</p>
        <p>In the final days before it releases its health plan, the Clinton Administration is working to shore up support among such political constituencies by disclosing aspects of the plan that will appeal to important groups.</p>
        <p>At other times, the Administration has appeared to be testing the waters for particularly controversial ideas.  The Administration seemed today to back away from one such idea, to limit tax deductions that employers may take for the cost of their workers' health benefits.  [ Page B11. ] Paying 20 Percent of Cost</p>
        <p>White House documents on the proposal for long-term care say that disabled people would, on the average, have to pay 20 percent of the cost of services they get under the new program. But there would generally be no charge for people whose incomes fall below the official poverty level ($11,187 for a family of three in 1992).</p>
        <p>Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 32 million elderly and 4 million disabled people, now covers very limited amounts of long-term care. Medicare beneficiaries could also qualify for the new benefit, providing "home and community-based services" outside a nursing home, if they paid a premium of $20 a month, beyond the standard Medicare premium, now $36.60 a month, the documents say.</p>
        <p>The Clinton proposal would also establish Federal standards for private insurance covering the costs of long-term care, in or out of a nursing home. Sales of such insurance have been increasing rapidly, but Congressional investigators and consumer advocates have reported abuses in its marketing.</p>
        <p>While Administration officials could not specify the cost of the new program, they said that it would be financed partly through premiums and cigarette taxes. The Government would make grants to each state, with the Federal share varying from 70 percent to 95 percent of the cost, the documents say. Each state's contribution would be "roughly equal to current state Medicaid spending on the severely disabled," the documents say. 'A Real Breakthrough'</p>
        <p>John C. Rother, chief lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons, said the Clinton proposal would be "a real breakthrough in covering home and community-based services for people of all ages with mental and physical disabilities -- not just older people, but also victims of accidents and children with birth defects."</p>
        <p>The proposal on long-term care will be formally presented, with the rest of Mr. Clinton's health plan, in a speech that he intends to deliver to a joint session of Congress later this month, probably the week of Sept. 20. Congress is expected to make many changes in Mr. Clinton's plan before approving legislation.</p>
        <p>White House documents describing the President's plan say the program for long-term care has these components:</p>
        <p>*Expanded home and community-based services.</p>
        <p>*Improvements in Medicaid coverage for institutional care.</p>
        <p>*Standards to improve the quality of private insurance for long-term care and tax incentives to encourage its purchase.</p>
        <p>*Tax incentives that support the efforts of individuals with disabilities to obtain employment.</p>
        <p>*A demonstration study intended to pave the way toward greater integration of acute and long-term care.</p>
        <p>Administration officials see community care as a way to tend to people in their own homes, where they want to be, at lower cost than in nursing homes. But Linda Keegan, vice president of the American Health Care Association, a trade group for nursing homes, said: "The Administration is perpetuating a myth in trying to sell this as a cost-saving measure. Studies over the last decade show that expanding home and community-based care adds to health costs. It costs more money because it doesn't substitute for nursing home care but serves a different population."</p>
        <p>Still, Stephen R. McConnell, senior vice president of the Alzheimer's Association, praised the presence of long-term care in the package, saying 1.2 million of the 4 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease might be helped by the new program. Providing Care to All</p>
        <p>The White House documents say that the proposal, to be known as the American Health Security Act, "increases Federal authority to provide home and community-based services to individuals with severe disabilities without regard to income or age."</p>
        <p>States would decide which services should be available. They could include assistance to help people with daily living, adult day care, rehabilitation services, physical modifications of the home and technology to aid the disabled.</p>
        <p>Administration officials say it is neither desirable nor possible for the Government to finance all long-term care. Accordingly, White House documents say Mr. Clinton will propose a wide range of tax breaks to encourage people to buy private insurance.</p>
        <p>Americans have bought more than 2.9 million insurance policies covering the cost of nursing home care. Such costs on average are more than $31,000 a year per person and are much higher in big cities like New York. Many elderly people without such insurance have been forced to exhaust their savings to become poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Clinton's plan, there would be a Federal tax credit for people with disabilities who work. They could use the credit to help pay for equipment or "personal-care services" that help them perform their work or daily activities.</p>
        <p>To combat abuses in the sale of insurance for long-term care, Mr. Clinton will propose that the Government set "minimum standards" for such insurance within two years, the documents say.</p>
        <p>The rules, to be enforced by state insurance commissioners, would require insurers to offer "inflation protection," so the value of a policy would not be eroded by the rising cost of long-term care.</p>
        <p>Under the Clinton plan, the Government would also prohibit "improper sales practices." Insurers could not deny coverage because of an applicant's medical problems existing before a certain date. And consumers who have paid premiums for years would be entitled to some benefits even if they later let their policies lapse.</p>
