        <p>The images came one after the other, forming the snapshot of a brief career.</p>
        <p>Ryan Thompson went over the center-field fence to steal a home run from the Astros in the top of the ninth. He then struck out, overmatched by a changeup artist's fastball, with the tying run on second in the bottom of the ninth.</p>
        <p>The Mets lost, 3-2, to Houston at Shea Stadium yesterday. Ryan Thompson got older and maybe wiser.</p>
        <p>"I've got to cash in there," Thompson said of his one-out failure against Doug Jones, who then struck out Ced Landrum to earn his 24th save.</p>
        <p>Thompson, who had scaled the wall in dead center to rob Eric Anthony of a home run, got ahead of Jones 3-0 with Jeff Kent at second base and the Mets desperate to avoid their 28th one-run defeat of 1993.</p>
        <p>Jones worked the corners to run the count full before blowing away Thompson with a fastball up. The swing, as always, was huge. It wound up empty, as it all too often has for the outfielder with the .223 average.</p>
        <p>"Didn't expect fastball," he said.</p>
        <p>Sid Fernandez, meanwhile, couldn't do enough with his fastball to beat Doug Drabek. Jeff Bagwell doubled home one Houston run. Casey Candaele hit his first homer of 1993 for another. Scott Servais singled in a run with two out in the seventh. Fernandez had once more pitched well enough to lose; his record slipped to 3-5.</p>
        <p>"He's kept us in baseball games," Manager Dallas Green said.</p>
        <p>The Mets, of course, did nothing with their chances to make the baseball games theirs. "We don't crack baseball games open," said Green. INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>EDDIE MURRAY, the run producer no contender wanted to trade for, hit his 21st home run of the season in the eighth, the 435th of his career. Only 20 major leaguers have hit more. . . . Outfielder DARRIN JACKSON, obtained from Toronto for TONY FERNANDEZ in June and out with hyperthyroidism since July, was activated and is available to pinch-hit. Shortstop TIM BOGAR was also taken off the disabled list. . . .  The victory by DOUG DRABEK ended the longest losing streak of his career (seven), was his first since July 4 and left him at 8-15.</p>
