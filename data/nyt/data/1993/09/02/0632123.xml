        <p>The residents of this thin sliver of sand southwest of Cape Hatteras awoke today to find their world miraculously intact, their damages limited to a few days of lost tourism business.</p>
        <p>But if North Carolina's Outer Banks largely dodged a bullet on Tuesday, when Hurricane Emily grazed it and headed out to sea, few areas in America exemplify the knotty issues surrounding coastal development more than this string of islands jutting into the Atlantic.</p>
        <p>Over the last two decades the Outer Banks have been transformed from a modest stretch of motels and beach cottages, where wild pigs and horses roamed free, to one of the fastest growing resort areas in the nation. The issues raised by the population boom on these shifting coastal sands will linger far after the memories of the storm's near miss have faded.</p>
        <p>Indications today were that both the natural environment and the man-made one had avoided catastrophic damage, with the exception of the town of Buxton north of Cape Hatteras, which was hit hard by wind, rain and surging 10-foot seas. Fears of Erosion</p>
        <p>Buxton, at the extreme southeastern tip of the Outer Banks, was hit much harder than Ocracoke and suffered the greatest damage.</p>
        <p>But, for the most part, beach damage all along the Outer Banks was less severe than many had feared.</p>
        <p>There had been fears that the hurricane would accelerate the erosion of the beaches along the Outer Banks, where the islands for the most part are less than a half mile wide. Experts say it clearly did some major damage to the beaches around Cape Hatteras and Buxton. North of Buxton, in Kitty Hawk, where many houses were built on the beach, several houses collapsed into the sea as the sand eroded beneath them.</p>
        <p>"We dodged a very large bullet here as far as erosion goes," said Doug Remaley, chief of the Nags Head Fire and Rescue Department north of here. "There was a substantial amount of erosion, but my personal opinion is that this was no worse than a severe northeast storm, which we get in the winter months." Growing Body of Knowledge</p>
        <p>In recent years, researchers have increasingly documented the degree to which the 295 barrier islands that stretch in a broken line from New England to Texas have been eroded in recent years. The Outer Banks are among the most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>One of the most visible national symbols of the coastal debate is the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse. When it was built in 1870, 1,500 feet of dunes and beach guarded it from the waves. Now that sandy buffer has been reduced to less than 300 feet, and no one knows what would have happened if the hurricane had come ashore there.</p>
        <p>Dare County, which includes Nags Head and Kitty Hawk, grew in population by 70 percent, to 22,746 in 1990 from 13,377 in 1980. Property values there have increased by 1,231 percent since 1976.</p>
        <p>"It's not like you get one Hurricane Andrew and wipe your brow and say, 'I'm glad we got that over with,' " said Beth Millemann, director of the Coast Alliance, a national coalition of environmental groups. "We have hurricanes after hurricanes after hurricanes, and the problem with living on the beach is it involves not only the people who have the beach house; it involves every taxpayer in America." Development Has Support</p>
        <p>Ms. Milleman was referring to a variety of programs, including National Flood Insurance, beach projects by the Army Corps of Engineers and bridges and highways, all of which employ tax money to support coastal development.</p>
        <p>Proponents of coastal development say her argument misses both the degree to which coastal development is an economic plus and the simple fact that people have always gravitated toward shores and always will. Many add that if people were moved away from all the nation's hazards, there might not be enough places to live.</p>
        <p>"If my house blew down tomorrow, I'd starting rebuilding the next day," said Guy Newell, who lives here. "I'd rather be here than in the Midwest floods, or in Tornado Alley or in some places that's likely to have an earthquake."</p>
        <p>But most agree that the major questions are not whether the coasts will be developed, but how they will be delveloped and who will bear the risks. Hurricane Andrew last year and the Midwest floods this year have renewed questions about the Federal flood insurance program, which critics say subsidizes development in hazardous areas. Similarly, critics have for years called for the mapping of erosion-prone coastal zones to help regulate development, but developers have so far fought off any such plan.</p>
        <p>Some experts say that the building codes and construction standards on the Outer Banks are quite good, and that the development there is a reminder that man and nature can coexist even on barrier islands.</p>
        <p>"The barrier islands have had thousands of hurricanes, and they survive," said Spencer Rogers, a coastal engineer at North Carolina State University. "The problem has been the fragile nature of what we build on them, not that the islands are fragile. And that depends on how we build."</p>
        <p>But others look at the glossy Outer Banks Magazine, with its advertisements for high-cost malls and wonder what they are doing on a barrier island.</p>
        <p>"I'm shocked by what I see there," said Stephen P. Leatherman, director of the Laboratory for Coastal Research at the University of Maryland at College Park. "I grew up in North Carolina when the Outer Banks was just simple classic cottages. It's as if there are no development controls at all."</p>
