        <p>Perry Klein, who has National Football League scouts calling for directions to the campus of C. W. Post College these days, had just finished studying game film on his next opponent.</p>
        <p>"Tough team," said Klein, tugging at the bill of his baseball cap and shaking his head. "We'll need to be prepared."</p>
        <p>Klein, one of the nation's top high school quarterbacks from California in in 1989, chose to play his college football at Cal-Berkeley instead of Penn State, Alabama, Miami or Stanford.</p>
        <p>Yet, this morning, the 6-foot-4-inch, 215-pounder wasn't preparing for such Division I-A powers. Nor was he bracing himself for a nationally televised clash with Pac-10 rivals such as Washington, U.C.L.A. or Southern Cal.</p>
        <p>"All of that is in the past now," said Klein, who now starts at quarterback for Post, a Division II team in the Eastern College Athletic Conference. "We got Pace University to worry about this week."</p>
        <p>Klein, who spent three years at Berkeley waiting for a chance to play regularly, transferred East this fall to a new school, new team and a new life. By transferring from a Division I to a Division II school, Klein could play immediately instead of sitting out a season.</p>
        <p>"It wasn't going to happen for me at Cal-Berkeley and I needed some place to prove that I can still play football," said the 22-year-old Klein, who in his final year of eligibility. "Time was running out on me."</p>
        <p>At Pacific Palisades High School, in California, five years ago, Klein threw for 3,889 yards and 37 touchdowns. As a senior, he transferred to Carson High School, where he led his team to the Los Angeles city title.</p>
        <p>But somehow he missed at Cal. After redshirting his first year, Klein competed as a freshman in 1991 with junior Mike Pawlawski for the starting quarterback position, which eventually went to Pawlawski.</p>
        <p>"I thought I had the job won," said Klein, with a trace of bitterness in his voice. "It was frustrating, but he was a junior and I was a freshman, so I figured there was still enough time for me to wait around for my chance." A Career in Disarray</p>
        <p>Last season, after two years of watching, Klein figured that his turn to call the signals had finally arrived. But Bruce Snyder, the head coach, departed for Arizona State. His assistant, Terry Shea, who helped Snyder recruit Klein, had left the program the year before. Snyder's unexpected exit triggered a series of coaching changes that left Klein's career in disarray.</p>
        <p>Under new coach Keith Gilbertson, Klein found himself in quarterback controversy, this time with a freshman, Dave Barr.</p>
        <p>"They were starting me in the practices, but when I saw that Dave was getting most of the reps, I knew the writing was on the wall," said Klein. "I guess it was just a case of a new coaching staff wanting to grow with a younger guy. In any event, I lost out again."</p>
        <p>Klein had completed 29 of 56 passes for 318 yards, was intercepted twice and had no touchdowns in three seasons but decided to look for another program that could make better use of his talents.</p>
        <p>"We informed both quarterbacks that we were opening up a competition at that position and that both would get 50 percent of the snaps in practice with the first team," said Gilbertson. "So his decision to quit was really quite surprising."</p>
        <p>But no one was more surprised than Tom Marshall, the head coach at C. W. Post, who got an N.F.L. prospect to run his team without having to invest in so much as a telephone call.</p>
        <p>"Traditionally, this program has taken lots of transfers," said Marshall. "When I heard that Perry wanted to come here, I was very excited. After all, he's probably one of the top five quarterbacks in the nation -- any division."</p>
        <p>Klein made his connection with Marshall through Gary Wichard, a pro sports agent who played quarterback for C. W. Post in the early 1970's, but now lives in Malibu, down the street from Klein's family.</p>
        <p>"Gary called me and told me all about Perry, how talented he was," said Marshall. "Gary knows quarterbacks, so I never even looked at Perry on film or read a scouting report on him. I just watched him when he got here, and he's everything Gary promised he would be.</p>
        <p>"We use the run-and-shoot offense here, and, in a short time, Perry has learned to work the offense to perfection," Marshall added. "He's made our team an awful lot better."</p>
        <p>In three games, Klein has completed 76 of 136 passes for 1,187 yards. He has thrown for nine touchdowns, with four interceptions.</p>
        <p>In Division II, Klein is currently third in the nation in passing and ninth in passing efficiency with a 145.2 rating. Last weekend, N.F.L. scouts were in the stands to see Klein complete 26 passes for 409 yards in Post's victory over Marist.</p>
        <p>"The people, the weather, the competition, it's all a different ball game over here," said Klein, watching as a team manager put the film projector on a table and rolled it out of the room. "But my goal is still the same as it was when I got out of high school, the same as it was when I went to Cal-Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Klein tugged at his baseball cap. "I just want to keep playing football," he said.</p>
