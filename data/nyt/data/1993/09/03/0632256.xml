        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>Mark Dendy once specialized in hurtling through space, blond curls flying, in his own and other choreographers' works. But even dancers grow older and begin to fix their gazes on new horizons. Mr. Dendy has not given up the dance, but his eyes are currently fixed on a cornerstone of performance art, the creation and portrayal of characters in episodic monologues.</p>
        <p>Tonight and tomorrow night at Performance Space 122, Mr. Dendy will present "Bus Ride to Heaven," in which a group of wildly different people find themselves together en route to that greater, final glory. The piece, presented earlier in the year at Dance Theater Workshop, has been described as a "one wo/man show," for several of the characters are women.</p>

        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>Mark Dendy once specialized in hurtling through space, blond curls flying, in his own and other choreographers' works. But even dancers grow older and begin to fix their gazes on new horizons. Mr. Dendy has not given up the dance, but his eyes are currently fixed on a cornerstone of performance art, the creation and portrayal of characters in episodic monologues.</p>
        <p>Tonight and tomorrow night at Performance Space 122, Mr. Dendy will present "Bus Ride to Heaven," in which a group of wildly different people find themselves together en route to that greater, final glory. The piece, presented earlier in the year at Dance Theater Workshop, has been described as a "one wo/man show," for several of the characters are women.</p>
        <p>Like John Kelly and Mark Morris, Mr. Dendy is one of those rare male actors who neither impersonates nor satirizes the women he plays. His recent portrait of Amanda Wingfield in Jane Comfort's "Faith Healing," for example, was a work of empathy and restraint. Among the characters he'll portray here, both male and female, are Mee-Maw, a 68-year-old murderess; Pawniehawnie, a prostitute addicted to heroin; Adam, who has AIDS; Lois, a religious fundamentalist, and Sandy Sheets, a televangelist and transvestite. Just an average bus ride through Manhattan, but with Mr. Dendy as the guide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dendy will perform tonight and tomorrow night at 10:30 at P.S. 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village. Tickets are $8; Theater Development Fund vouchers are accepted. Reservations: (212) 477-5288. Charge: (212) 307-7171.</p>
