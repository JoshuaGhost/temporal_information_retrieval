        <p>"I don't like to see international sporting events turned into political football," TED TURNER, chairman of Turner Broadcasting said yesterday at Rockefeller Center, where he in town promoting his own 1994 Goodwill Games. "I don't like boycotts. That's what the political arena is for."</p>
        <p>Turner was responding to the prospect that China might consider boycotting the 1996 Atlanta Games if it does not win its bid to be host to the 2000 Games.</p>
        <p>Turner said he created his own Olympic-style arena -- the Goodwill Games -- as an attempt to ease cold-war tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The first games were held in Moscow in 1986 and then in Seattle in 1990. Next year's edition will be held in St. Petersburg, Russia, and 1998's is scheduled for New York City.</p>
        <p>Some may question why there should be any more games, considering there is no more cold war, but not Turner.</p>
        <p>"The Goodwill Games were started primarily to get athletes from the East and West together after the boycotts and to help end the cold war," Turner said, referring to boycotts of the 1980 Moscow Game and 1984 Los Angeles Games. "The way I look at it now, Russia's still got most of the nuclear weapons and we need to continue the friendship we started eight years ago."  SPORTS PEOPLE: GOODWILL GAMES</p>
