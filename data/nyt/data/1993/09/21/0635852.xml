        <p>When the Clinton Administration set out to streamline government, a lot of budget watchdogs said there was no better place to start than at the helium reserve here, a cluster of mines, pipes and cooling vats that was $1.3 billion in debt and 100 years ahead on the supply curve.</p>
        <p>But when President Clinton's National Performance Review finally focused on the cold-war-era complex this month, it suggested that Congress cancel the program's debt and issued a vague call to "increase efficiencies in helium operations."</p>
        <p>Rather than becoming a model of "reinvented" government, the helium reserve -- begun in the 1920's to inflate blimps and used today by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in its spacecraft -- became instead a model of how politics and economics can sometimes converge to spare seemingly unnecessary programs. Talking About Helium</p>
        <p>The politics was simple. Amarillo's Congressman, Bill Sarpalius, a conservative Democrat who proved to be a crucial vote in favor of the President's budget bill last month, spoke to Mr. Clinton four times on the day of the vote, repeatedly bringing up his concern about preserving the program, which provides 220 jobs in Amarillo, in the Texas Panhandle.</p>
        <p>"Sure I talked to the President about helium," Mr. Sarpalius said in an interview. "I talk to everyone I can in the Government about helium. And when I had the opportunity to explain to him that this was not really a billion-dollar loss, that this is a program that makes money for the Federal Government, that there's another side to this picture, he was fascinated by it. He was really interested in helium."</p>
        <p>Critics of the debt-ridden program, which was bolstered in the 1960's amid fears that America might run out of helium as its space program was rushing to put men on the moon, have urged that it be abolished or privatized. "We may conceivably in the future need ermine pelts and Grand Marnier," said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union. "That doesn't mean the Federal Government needs to be in charge of stockpiling them."</p>
        <p>But L. Dale Bippus, who as general manager of the Federal Helium Reserve of the Bureau of Mines oversees a stockpile of 32 billion cubic feet of the gas, enough to supply current Federal demands for the next 100 years, boasts of the Federal program with the huge surplus -- of helium. "We're the Fort Knox of helium," he said. "It was a wise investment, I think. We've got a tremendous asset here that we acquired at a reasonable price."</p>
        <p>The economics of helium is complex. But, in essence, the problem is this: Although the Government is sitting atop a helium supply worth $1.6 billion at today's prices, there is no way it can simply sell off the gas and give the cash to the Treasury.</p>
        <p>Doing so, virtually everyone agrees, would lead to a collapse in the world helium market, quickly dropping the price to pennies on the taxpayers' investment dollars. As expensive as it was to get into the helium program, it could prove even more costly to leave.</p>
        <p>And so the federally owned helium sits in an underground mine, trapped beneath a layer of impermeable rock and released only when a Federal agency calls for it.</p>
        <p>Odorless and colorless, helium has the valuable property of remaining gaseous to the extremely low temperature of minus 452 degrees. It is used mostly by NASA, which relies on supercooled helium to pressurize fuel tanks and to act as a copllant, and by the Defense Department for rockets and research. Inflated Projections</p>
        <p>Financially speaking, projections in 1960 that the Government would make money in the helium business proved wildly inflated. Founded with a taxpayer loan of $352 million, the program is now $1.3 billion in debt, even though the Government charges its own agencies 20 percent more for helium than the going rate in private industry. Not that it has to worry about the competition: Federal law prohibits Federal agencies from buying helium anywhere except at the Federal reserve.</p>
        <p>Defenders of the reserve say it is a moneymaker because it returned $28 million to the Treasury last year while costing only $15 million to operate. But critics say these figures are misleading because it is all Government money anyway.</p>
        <p>In any event, the figures do not take into account the cost of servicing the debt. To pay that off by the statutory deadline of 1995, the General Accounting Office calculated in a report last year, the reserve would have to charge $3,000 per 1,000 cubic feet -- enough to inflate a 12-foot balloon -- on all sales in the next two years; its current price is $55, and private industry charges about $46.</p>
        <p>"It's an affront to the free enterprise system," said Representative C. Christopher Cox, a Republican from Orange County, Calif., who has emerged as the chief Congressional critic of the reserve. "It's a hoary example of socialism, of state-run industry, at a time when the whole world has rejected socialism."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox has introduced an amendment to the National Helium Act of 1960 that would allow NASA, which bought 131 million cubic feet of helium in the last fiscal year, to buy helium privately. These suppliers already provide all the helium bought by non-Government customers, which account for about 90 percent of the helium used in the United States. While it is most commonly used to inflate children's balloons, helium is also used for things as varied as welding and magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
        <p>The Cox amendment passed in the House but is languishing in the Senate. Whatever its fate, there is tremendous pressure from the private suppliers -- including Exxon, Enron, Mobil and other major corporations -- against the reverse concept: allowing the Government to sell gas to private customers.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Bippus said: "I don't think the Government's job is to try to put private industry out of business." 'What Are We Going to Do?'</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bippus, on a tour of the complex here, said he was frustrated at the derision directed at his agency, where he has worked for the 37 years. And he was angry that the critics -- including Mr. Cox and P. J. O'Rourke, the humorist who in his 1991 book "Parliament of Whores" called the helium program "amazingly stupid, even by government standards" -- had never even bothered to come out to Amarillo.</p>
        <p>"Well, we own it, so what are we going to do with it?" Mr. Bippus asked. "Are you just going to vent it out into the air? I could blow all this helium into the atmosphere. Is that going to make you feel better?"</p>
        <p>For reasons unclear to geologists, the United States has the world's greatest concentrations of helium, mainly in Wyoming and in a field that stretches through the Texas Panhandle and into Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>
        <p>The Federal helium program dates to 1925, when the Government refined the gas for use in blimps, then an emerging vehicle for use in war. The Germans desperately wanted it for their zeppelins, but the United States said no, so the Germans turned to flammable hydrogen, at least until the Hindenburg explosion in 1937. 'Helium Capital of the World'</p>
        <p>Today, less than 1 percent of the Government's helium is used for blimps, although there have been persistent reports that the Pentagon is working on a classified, helium-inflated spy craft referred to in military circles as the "stealth blimp."</p>
        <p>There is no question that helium is important to Amarillo. Inscribed on the front of the local telephone directory is: "Amarillo is proud to be the helium capital of the world."</p>
        <p>Mr. Cox said: 'No one ought to begrudge Bill Sarpalius his defense of this boondoggle. It's his job as a Congressman to defend it. But everybody in Congress votes on it, and not everybody in Congress is from Amarillo."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Sarpalius insisted he was not protecting any local pork-barrel project, and instead believed he had persuaded the President of the program's merits. "If you're asking was there a tradeoff," he said, referring to his vote in favor of Mr. Clinton's budget, "there wasn't a tradeoff."</p>
        <p>And out where the helium is kept, Mr. Bippus said that decades from now important new uses for helium would probably be discovered, and Americans would praise the Government's foresight in stockpiling it. "But it really comes down to this," he added. "If you could tell me what the future demand for helium was going to be, I could tell you whether this was a good investment."</p>
