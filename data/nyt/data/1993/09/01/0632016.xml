        <p>AS the corn season begins to fade, there is a sense of urgency about savoring it at every possible moment. Although corn would not ordinarily appear in an authentic dish of curried chicken, it fits perfectly, adding a pleasing sweetness and crunch.</p>
        <p>If you wish, serve the chicken over plain rice. To cool the heat of the curry, a yogurt-cucumber dish called raita is traditional. And when summer is long past, this dish can still be enjoyed. Just make it with frozen corn. Indian Summer Chicken</p>
        <p>8 ounces whole onion or 7 ounces chopped ready-cut onion (1 1/2 cups)  1 tablespoon canola oil  1 large clove garlic  1 tablespoon fresh or frozen ginger  1 teaspoon cumin  1/2teaspoon ground coriander  1/2 teaspoon cinnamon  1/4 teaspoon turmeric  1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon hot chili flakes  1 pound ripe field tomatoes  6 ounces skinless, boneless chicken breast  2 ears corn  1/2 cup nonfat plain yogurt  1 teaspoon cornstarch  1/8 teaspoon salt  Freshly ground black pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Chop whole onions and saute in hot canola oil in nonstick skillet large enough to hold all the ingredients.</p>
        <p>2. Mince garlic and coarsely grate ginger. Add to onion along with cumin, coriander, cinnamon, turmeric and hot chili flakes. Stir well and continue cooking over medium heat.</p>
        <p>3. Wash and trim tomatoes and cut into medium chunks; stir into onion and continue cooking.</p>
        <p>4. Wash and dry chicken and cut into thin strips; cut strips in half and add to skillet.</p>
        <p>5. Scrape kernels off corn and add to skillet.</p>
        <p>6. Stir a little yogurt into cornstarch until smooth, and blend with remaining yogurt. Stir into skillet, and cook until mixture thickens, just a couple of minutes. Season with salt and pepper and serve over rice.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 370 calories, 10 grams fat, 50 milligrams cholesterol, 275 milligrams sodium, 30 grams protein, 45 grams carbohydrate.</p>
