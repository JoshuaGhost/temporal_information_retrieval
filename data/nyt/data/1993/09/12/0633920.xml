        <p>Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers who have to take the bus to the subway have long cursed both geography and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which makes them pay for both trips.</p>
        <p>Now, with ridership sagging, the M.T.A. has proposed something that will save commuters money, if not time: free transfers.</p>
        <p>What the M.T.A. is calling for in its four-year business plan, to be presented to its financial committee tomorrow, would do away with so-called two-fare zones, meaning that riders would pay only one fare for both legs of their commute, the way a bus rider can now get a transfer ticket to head uptown after a crosstown trip.</p>
        <p>If approved, the change would affect about 400,000 city residents, or 14 percent of the New York City Transit Authority's ridership, and would mark the biggest shift in fare policy since Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia united the three separate subway systems with a single nickel fare in 1940. Good News in Sheepshead Bay</p>
        <p>"It's something that people in Sheepshead Bay in Brooklyn and Queens Village and Williamsbridge in the Bronx have wanted for generations," said Gene Russianoff, a staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit riders' advocacy group. "If you were to go into my old neighborhood in Sheepshead Bay and ask people what they don't like about New York, on their top-five list would be that they live in a two-fare zone. It's up there with crime and lack of services."</p>
        <p>The free transfers -- something the M.T.A. had resisted for years -- are being embraced by its chairman, Peter E. Stangl, as a way to increase ridership, which fell to 1.44 billion in 1992 from 1.56 billion in 1988, largely because of the recession.</p>
        <p>"The issue is obviously one of satisfying customers, but it's also trying to provide the type of transportation that this region needs," Mr. Stangl said in an interview. "We need to increase our ridership and deal with the increasing problems of air quality and congestion that will ultimately determine whether this area remains a terrific place to be."</p>
        <p>But it is uncertain whether the proposal will survive a vote by the board later this month, primarily because of concerns about cost. And even if the proposal passes, it will not be feasible until the new fare-card machines are installed throughout the bus and subway system, which is expected to take at least three years.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, city officials and commuters alike welcomed its inclusion in the business plan. "It reflects a new movement on behalf of the M.T.A., a dramatic step in the right direction," said Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation adviser to Mayor David N. Dinkins. "This is something he's called for ever since he's been Mayor." Now to Find the Money</p>
        <p>Last year's four-year business plan, which also anticipated the possibilities of automated fare collection, called for a 50 percent discount on the second leg of a combined bus-subway trip. Since then, the M.T.A. has conducted research indicating that such a discount would cost $50 million a year and increase ridership by only 0.4 percent. A free connection, however, while costing $89 million a year, would increase ridership by 3.2 percent.</p>
        <p>The big question is money, and it is not clear how this proposal would be financed. The M.T.A. has already said that it will need some increase in the $1.25 fare for subways and buses in 1995. Whether that will be enough to finance the free transfers, or whether an infusion of state and city money would also be necessary, is unclear.</p>
        <p>"The discussion of eliminating two-fare zones is a terrific thing because we're trying to encourage people to get out of their automobiles and use mass transit," said Lucius J. Riccio, the New York City Transportation Commissioner. "But you have to really consider the total economic package to make sure that we can do this and pay for it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Riccio, one of four mayoral appointees to the M.T.A. board, raised the thorny issue of how income from the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is distributed. Half the tolls collected by the Authority now go to the bus and subway system and the other half to the railroads. "The distribution of the T.B.T.A. tolls puts a lot of money into commuter rail, which runs surpluses, and not enough in the subway, which is in deficit," he said.</p>
        <p>M.T.A. officials say that a fare-card system would prevent the abuse of a free connection. A fare card would be encoded with the time and location of a trip, and give a rider only a certain amount of time to get on a connecting subway from a bus.</p>
        <p>A plan announced last year under the M.T.A.'s Fare Deal program to sell monthly passes for unlimited trips would also allow free transfers between buses and subways. But the current proposal goes beyond that and would apply to those who wanted to buy a week's worth of fare cards or a card for a single trip.</p>
