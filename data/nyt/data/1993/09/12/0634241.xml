        <p>As educators and business leaders commiserated last week about the bleak findings of a national study on adult literacy, there was widespread agreement that the tepid solutions now in place need expansion, improvement and more money.</p>
        <p>That is no small order. The Education Department's four-year study indicates nearly half of the nation's 191 million adults possess low reading comprehension and math skills.</p>
        <p>"We have to rethink the way we do our business and how we go about delivering education across the board," said Ronald Gillum, director of adult learning for the Michigan Department of Education. "But we have some tough choices to make because resources are tight."</p>
        <p>Efforts to upgrade the literacy skills of Americans had a strong advocate in recent years in Barbara Bush, the former First Lady. But a full decade before that, the private sector had sounded the alarm. Corporate executives complained that the level of basic skills among their workers was distressingly low, largely because too little money was flowing into too few programs. Who's to Blame?</p>
        <p>There was much assigning of blame, with public schools and families each coming in for their share. Researchers said immigration helped lower the overall level of literacy.</p>
        <p>And some of the available adult reading programs have come under attack for being outdated and underfinanced. "Most of these programs are not as rigorous as they ought to be," said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great City Schools, an association of the country's urban school systems. "Part of it is an issue of raw investment on the part of the country."</p>
        <p>Who should ultimately take responsibility for improving the literacy rate is, of course, under debate. Public schools say administrators say they are already overburdened. Community colleges, the traditional source of adult literacy classes, have seen budget cuts undermine services and are stretched thin. And some executives have become increasingly resentful about having to finance programs for their workers, saying they are being asked to pay twice -- once in school taxes and a second time in paying for in-house classes.</p>
        <p>On one point, though, everyone agrees: the solution will require new public and private resources and a much stronger Federal role in financing and providing a framework for expanded literacy programs. The Clinton Administration already is moving in that direction, albeit slowly. Its current budget includes a $270 million program, jointly financed by the Education and Labor Departments, that strengthens the academic and job skills of high school students bound for the workplace.</p>
        <p>"It is the beginning, it seems to me, of a national reform for all schools," said William H. Kolberg, president of the National Alliance of Business.</p>
