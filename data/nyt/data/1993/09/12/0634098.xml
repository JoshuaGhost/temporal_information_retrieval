        <p>SEVERAL years ago, Gary Kasparov spotted the enormous talent in a young fellow Soviet player, Vladimir Kramnik, and singled him out for special coaching. In June 1992, Kasparov put him on the Russian team for the Manila Olympiad and Kramnik, still unknown abroad, turned in the highest score, 8 1/2- 1/2, an extraordinary contribution to the squad's victory.</p>
        <p>Kramnik, now 18, continues to fulfill his mentor's prophecy of a brilliant career. He became the youngest of the 10 to qualify for the International Chess Federation world title candidates matches by tying for second place in the Interzonal Tournament, which finished in early August in Biel, Switzerland. He showed his skill in combination play against Bosko Abramovic of Yugoslavia in Round 2.</p>

        <p>SEVERAL years ago, Gary Kasparov spotted the enormous talent in a young fellow Soviet player, Vladimir Kramnik, and singled him out for special coaching. In June 1992, Kasparov put him on the Russian team for the Manila Olympiad and Kramnik, still unknown abroad, turned in the highest score, 8 1/2- 1/2, an extraordinary contribution to the squad's victory.</p>
        <p>Kramnik, now 18, continues to fulfill his mentor's prophecy of a brilliant career. He became the youngest of the 10 to qualify for the International Chess Federation world title candidates matches by tying for second place in the Interzonal Tournament, which finished in early August in Biel, Switzerland. He showed his skill in combination play against Bosko Abramovic of Yugoslavia in Round 2.</p>
        <p>The Classical Variation with 5 Bf4 in the Queen's Gambit Declined was once considered inferior to 5 Bg5 because it does not inhibit Black's freeing thrust, 5 . . . c5 or 6 . . . c5. Lately, however, it seems that White does well by either giving Black an isolated d pawn or exploiting superior piece mobility.</p>
        <p>For example, the Kasparov-Rafael Vaganian game last year in Debrecen, Hungary, turned in White's favor after 5 . . . O-O 6 e3 c5 7 dc Bc5 8 Qc2 Nc6 9 a3 Qa5 10 O-O-O Ne4 11 Nb5! a6 12 Nc7 e5 13 Rd5! f5? 14 Re5! Ne5 15 Be5. So some, like Abramovic here, are trying the more solid, but passive 5 . . . c6.</p>
        <p>In going after the bishop-pair with 7 . . . Nh5 8 Bg3 Ng3 9 hg, Abramovic was surely aware that he was conceding Kramnik the possibility of creating attacking chances on the semi-open h file. And then he had no other reasonable place to put his king but on that wing with 10 . . . O-O.</p>
        <p>His idea was to develop a queenside counterattack after 11 O-O-O dc 12 Bc4 b5 13 Bd3 Qa5. But it is hard to fetter a belligerent like Kramnik. That his 16 Neg5! was no empty probe became clear after 16 . . . Nf8 17 Nh7! The black kingside was breached and 17 . . . Nh7 18 Bg6! Nf8 19 Bh7! Kg7 20 Qe4 Bf6 21 Qf4! Nh7 22 Rh7! Kh7 23 Qf6 would have set up the decisive threat of 24 Rh1.</p>
        <p>Abramovic kept fighting with 17 . . . c5 18 Nf8 cd 19 Qb3 Bf8, but Kramnik struck again with 20 Bg6! ready for 20 . . . fg 21 Qe6 Kg7 22 Ne5, which leaves Black defenseless.</p>
        <p>After 23 Rd7, the threat of 24 Qe6 could not be fended off by 23 . . . Qb6 because of 24 Ng5 Rf8 25 Ne6. Abramovic was able to play 23 . . . Be7 because 24 Re7? would allow 24 . . . Bc4!</p>
        <p>The defense that Abramovic constructed with 26 . . . Bf6 was immediately smashed by Kramnik's 27 Qh7! Kf8 28 Rf4 Ke7 29 Rf6! Seeing that 29 . . . Kf6 leads to 30 Qh4 Kg6 31 Qh6 Kf5 32 Qf4 Kg6 33 Rh6 Kg7 34 Qf6 Kf8 35 Rh8mate, Abramovic gave up.  QUEEN'S GAMBIT DECLINED</p>
