        <p>A PINCH of curry powder can do wonders for a dish. But now chefs and serious cooks are going a step further and making their own pastes, powders and curry oils at home. It takes only minutes and the results are enormously satisfying. Eggplant, tomatoes, new potatoes and string beans are superb perked up with a dash of curry, and they go very well with meat or fish cooked on the grill.</p>
        <p>The spices used in curry powder also make an excellent oil. Philippe Chin, chef and owner of Chanterelles, a popular French restaurant in Philadelphia, recently galvanized guests at a Manhattan dinner party by serving gravlax seasoned with curry oil on blinis as an hors d'oeuvre.</p>
        <p>The word curry comes from kari, an Indian word meaning sauce. It is made from a mixture of spices prepared and roasted by the cook. The spices are ground in a mortar and pestle or a spice grinder. Curry powder must be stored away from the light in a sealed container. It loses its flavor after a few weeks.  Spiced Gravlax With Sesame-Ginger Blinis  Total time: 36 hours for marinating, 1 hour hands-on.  1/2 pound kosher salt</p>
        <p>1/4 pound sugar</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon cracked black pepper</p>
        <p>5 tablespoons Chinese five-spice powder</p>
        <p>1 pound center-cut salmon, de-boned, skin on</p>
        <p>For the curry oil:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon curry powder (see recipe below)</p>
        <p>2 bay leaves</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>For the blinis:</p>
        <p>1 pound potatoes, peeled, cooked and mashed</p>
        <p>5 whole eggs</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons milk</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons heavy cream</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon baking powder</p>
        <p>1 1/2 tablespoons grated ginger, skin on</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon toasted black sesame seed</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon toasted white sesame seed</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper</p>
        <p>2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil.  1. Combine salt, sugar, cracked pepper and three tablespoons five-spice powder. Pour half mixture on a cookie sheet, place salmon on top and cover with remaining mixture. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 36 hours.</p>
        <p>2. Remove salmon from sheet and soak fish in cold water for 30 minutes. Dry and sprinkle with remaining five-spice powder. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Make curry oil. Pour vegetable oil into small saucepan and whisk in curry powder. Add bay leaves and salt and simmer gently for 15 minutes. Strain and set aside.</p>
        <p>4. Make blinis. Combine mashed potatoes, eggs, milk, cream and olive oil in a bowl with the baking powder, ginger and black and white sesame seeds, salt and pepper. Mix together until smooth.</p>
        <p>5. Heat one tablespoon olive oil in large skillet. Ladle about one tablespoon batter for each blini into skillet (they should be about the size of a silver dollar -- six to eight at a time without crowding) and cook for about two minutes on each side. Remove from pan and cook another batch of blinis, using oil as needed. Blinis can be made in advance and warmed in oven before being served.</p>
        <p>6. Slice salmon very thin at an angle. Warm blinis in 200-degree oven. Roll up each slice into a cylinder shape and place on top of blinis. Drizzle with curry oil and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 50 blinis. Curried New Potatoes With Coriander  Total time: 45 minutes  1 medium onion, chopped</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon coriander seeds</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon cumin</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon chili powder</p>
        <p>6 cardamom seeds, removed</p>
        <p>from husk</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon turmeric</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds Yukon gold or red-skinned potatoes, peeled</p>
        <p>Juice 1/2 lemon</p>
        <p>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons fresh coriander leaves (cilantro).  1. Saute onion in oil until soft.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, in separate frying pan, toast coriander, cumin, chili powder and cardamom seeds. Grind in spice grinder or with mortar and pestle. Add ground spices and cinnamon and turmeric to onion. Stir well and add potatoes, lemon juice, salt and pepper and one cup water. Cover and cook over low heat for 30 minutes, or until potatoes are done, checking to make sure they do not dry out. If necessary, add a little water. Correct seasoning, sprinkle with coriander leaves, toss and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings. Mild Curry Powder</p>
        <p>Total time: 40 minutes  1 tablespoon turmeric</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons ground mace</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons ground cloves</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons peppercorns</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons peeled cardamom seeds</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons cumin seed</p>
        <p>2 bay leaves</p>
        <p>1 dried red chili.  1. Preheat oven to 200 degrees. Roast all ingredients for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Grind until fine in a spice grinder. Place in a container sealed tightly and store away from the light.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 cup curry powder.</p>
