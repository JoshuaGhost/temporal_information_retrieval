        <p>The workers in the shipyard here who braved the strikes, bloodshed and martial law on the way to democracy recognize that they owe their opportunity to vote in parliamentary elections on Sunday in large part to the triumphs of their old leader.</p>
        <p>But as they contemplate the multitude of choices at the ballot box, Lech Walesa, once head of the Solidarity movement and now President of Poland, seems irrelevant, even an embarrassment, and his name evokes shrugs of dismissal.</p>
        <p>"He's like a commemorative statue," Henryk Grosiak, a 20-year veteran of the yards, said while supervising workers atop a ship's deck. "When it's first welded and shining, people come to see it but after a while it stops shining and people stop coming."</p>
        <p>Three months ago, President Walesa, whose position is not up for re-election until 1995, created what he called a nonpolitical movement, the Nonparty Bloc to Cooperate with the Government. The idea, he said, was to shore up market reforms and keep the former Communists from winning the election for Parliament. Walesa's Popularity Drops</p>
        <p>Mr. Walesa, shrewd enough to perceive the threat that many others ignored, appears to have failed in both respects. And his own popularity has plummeted to a record low while his new bloc is lagging badly in the polls.</p>
        <p>His bloc has failed to take root because he is largely viewed as either tired goods or as a President whose greatest goal is to strengthen his own powers.</p>
        <p>As Poland goes to the polls for the third time since Communism collapsed in 1989, two parties that are outgrowths of the Polish Communist Party are poised to win: in opinion surveys, the urban-based Democratic Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party surpass the centrist Democratic Union of Prime Minister Hanna Suchocka.</p>
        <p>Political analysts said it seemed clear that the former Communists would dominate the new Parliament, although the shape of any new coalition remains unclear, because neither the Alliance nor the Peasant Party is expected to win more than 20 percent of the vote, and because Ms. Suchocka's party refuses to join a coalition with the former Communists. Exploiting Frustrations</p>
        <p>The Democratic Left Alliance has held well-attended rallies in Poland's second largest city, Lodz, where their parliamentary candidate is Leszek Miller, the former secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee. Mr. Miller and the leader of the Alliance, Aleksander Kwasniewski, a former Minister of Sports in the Communist Party, have tapped into the frustrations of workers, pensioners and former Communists who have not tasted the fruits of the country's turn toward a market economy.</p>
        <p>The Alliance has tried to retool itself along the lines of European social democratic parties. But while its leaders may present a more moderate picture, there are concerns that their core support among the nearly one million people in the former party apparatus would push the leadership toward the old ways.</p>
        <p>In response, Mr. Kwasniewski asserted: "Our program has not a single thing that would remind you of Communism. If someone in our party proposed a return to a central command economy, he would have to be expelled, not for being a Communist but for being an idiot." Slowing Privatization</p>
        <p>The Alliance has said it will maintain privatization but at a slower pace, calling for a "more active role for the state" in the economy, a code word for increased subsidies for state industry. Ms. Suchocka had to reach out to the party this year to muster enough votes to pass her extensive privatization program. But the party would most likely slow down privatization to please its constituency and to show it was not ideologically wed to a process that, to many voters, means unemployment.</p>
        <p>The party has also said it would allow the deficit to grow to 5.5 or 6 percent of the gross domestic product, beyond the 5 percent that the International Monetary Fund has insisted on as a condition for loans. The deficit would grow, the leaders have said, for free education and medical care.</p>
        <p>The party is also promising to counter what it considers the growing "clericalization" of Polish society by the Roman Catholic Church, and the party platform includes lifting the new stringent anti-abortion law. 15% Unemployment Rate</p>
        <p>To the 2.8 million unemployed -- 15.2 percent of the work force -- the startling notion that Poland's economy is expected to be the fastest growing in Europe this year means little. And in the countryside, home to about 40 percent of the electorate, there is widespread grumbling over high credit and subsidized agricultural imports from the European Community.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Suchocka made a last-minute appeal on Thursday to the electorate of 27 million, saying her 14-month Government created a better-managed and more prosperous Poland. And her office released a letter today from President Clinton in which he said that "all Polish people can take pride in how much has been accomplished in just four years."</p>
        <p>The point of Mr. Clinton's message was to back up Ms. Suchocka's long-held theme, one that the former Communists have side-stepped: that Poland needed quick agreement on debt negotiations with its commercial creditors to allow for a more extensive transition to a market economy. For Walesa, a Corner</p>
        <p>President Walesa, for his part, has provided little more than vague statements on campaign matters. Asked 10 days ago by the Government news agency whether he would cooperate with the left after the elections, Mr. Walesa replied: "Would I have any choice? I would not propose a civil war for the nation. Either there is democracy and electoral law, which have to be used and obeyed, or there isn't."</p>
        <p>Later, he seemed to hint that he might dissolve the Parliament if he did not like the election results.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Walesa, who will turn 50 on Sept. 29, 10 days after the election, the failure of his new bloc to make it into Parliament would be a major blow. Under Poland's new election law, a party must win at least 5 percent of the vote to be represented in Parliament. Walesa Bloc Drops 5 Points</p>
        <p>Initially, Mr. Walesa's new party polled more than 10 percent among the nearly two dozen parties, but since July it has hovered around the 5 percent cut-off mark. Moreover, Mr. Walesa's personal approval rating, according to Demoskop, a Polish polling organization, has dropped to 25 percent this year, from 75 percent in 1990.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Walesa lost the support of the Polish people when he embarked on his political career," said Wojciek Pawlak, a sociologist at the Polish Academy of Sciences. "His strength is turning people against something or someone. He can't very well turn the people against himself now that he is the highest public official."</p>
        <p>Mr. Walesa ceased to be Solidarity's chairman when he became President in 1991. His relations with the much weakened trade union group have deteriorated to such an extent that he was not invited to its June congress -- and Solidarity refused to back his bloc. Dismay and Appreciation</p>
        <p>"Look, when the Pope came to Poland, Walesa as head of state drops to his knees and kisses his hand," said Robert Slizewski, a 35-year-old shipyard worker, as he took a break from examining a blueprint. "He's head of state and represents us. Not all of us would drop to their knees to the head of the church. Walesa is great at rabble rousing, he's no good at governing."</p>
        <p>But for all the criticisms of Mr. Walesa, the shipyard workers stressed two achievements of his early leadership: the new prosperity of the shipyard and the freedom to vote. For that they are grateful and say they will watch with some trepidation the results of Sunday's elections.</p>
        <p>Asked if a victory by the former Communists would make little difference, Mr. Grosiak, the shipyard supervisor, replied, "We're not quite that mature a democracy, yet."</p>
