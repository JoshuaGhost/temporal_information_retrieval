        <p>Heading into the last month of the gubernatorial race with polls showing her trailing badly, Christine Todd Whitman today demoted her campaign manager -- her brother, Webster B. (Danny) Todd -- and put Ed Rollins, an experienced political strategist, in charge of her Republican campaign.</p>
        <p>"Danny Todd is going to remain, but he is not going to be calling the shots," a senior Republican official said.</p>

        <p>Heading into the last month of the gubernatorial race with polls showing her trailing badly, Christine Todd Whitman today demoted her campaign manager -- her brother, Webster B. (Danny) Todd -- and put Ed Rollins, an experienced political strategist, in charge of her Republican campaign.</p>
        <p>"Danny Todd is going to remain, but he is not going to be calling the shots," a senior Republican official said.</p>
        <p>Assembly Speaker Garabed (Chuck) Haytaian confirmed the changes in the Whitman campaign last night.</p>
        <p>"I had heard it was a mutual thing, that he wanted some of the responsibilities that had been on his shoulders the last five months taken off him," said Mr. Haytaian, who attended a Republican fund-raising reception for Mrs. Whitman last night in Edison.</p>
        <p>Carl Golden, the chief spokesman for the Whitman campaign, said that Mr. Rollins had joined the campaign on a daily basis and that Mr. Todd would now be in charge of other Republican politicians who will be called on in the coming weeks to campaign for Mrs. Whitman. But he said the arrangement was not a shakeup.</p>
        <p>"Any speculation that this is other than the best use of the people in this campaign is wrong," Mr. Golden said. "I can only tell you that Rollins is here day to day, all of which was in the plan from the beginning."</p>
        <p>The campaign of Mrs. Whitman's Democratic rival, Gov. Jim Florio, moved quickly to try to exploit the situation.</p>
        <p>"Mrs. Whitman has gone through four media consultants, three press secretaries and three camapaign managers," said Jo Astrid Glading, the spokeswoman for the Florio campaign. "The public is beginning to realize that the problem with Mrs. Whitman's campaign is not her staff; it's her credibility." 20 Years on Montana Ranch</p>
        <p>Mr. Todd, 54, served one term as a member of the New Jersey Assembly, from 1968 to 1970. He had spent the last two decades on a ranch he owns in Montana before returning to the state this year to help with his sister's gubernatorial campaign as volunteer adviser.</p>
        <p>On the day after Mrs. Whitman's June 8 primary victory, she appointed Mr. Todd campaign manager, despite the reservations of some senior Republican leaders in the state who advised her that he did not have the experience to run a major campaign.</p>
        <p>During the primary race and into the general election race, Mrs. Whitman's campaign has been plagued by embarrassing blunders that the Florio campaign, under the direction of James Carville, has used to keep her on the defensive and off stride.</p>
        <p>But workers within Mrs. Whitman's campaign and on the State Republican Committee staff said the Republican candidate was shaken by a New York Times/CBS-TV News poll released on Tuesday that showed her trailing the Governor, 51 percent to 30 percent. Troubling Poll Showings</p>
        <p>Even more troubling for the Republican campaign were two other poll showings: that voters had a more favorable impression of Mr. Florio on the questions of honesty, integrity, trust and leadership; and that they might be more forgiving than thought possible over a $2.8 billion tax increase that the Governor pushed through the Legislature in 1990. Those are the very issues that Mrs. Whitman has spent the entire summer hammering Mr. Florio on in speeches and in broadcast ads.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to ease the impact of the New York Times/CBS-TV News poll, Mrs. Whitman's campaign took the extraordinary step of releasing its most recent internal poll to reporters today.</p>
        <p>It showed Mr. Florio leading Mrs. Whitman 42 percent to 37 percent, with 16 percent of the voters undecided. It said 5 percent of the vote was spread among a dozen independent or third party candidates on the Nov. 2 ballot.</p>
