        <p>Seeking to offer a counterproposal to the economic plan unveiled last week by Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Gov. Jim Florio promised today to make nearly $1 billion available in state-backed business loans and investments over the next four years.</p>
        <p>"There's no pie in the sky in this. No promises. No ledger sheets that don't add up," said Mr. Florio, who took to the stump to tout his plan to expand the Economic Development Authority, a state-run agency that guarantees bank loans for business.</p>

        <p>Seeking to offer a counterproposal to the economic plan unveiled last week by Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Gov. Jim Florio promised today to make nearly $1 billion available in state-backed business loans and investments over the next four years.</p>
        <p>"There's no pie in the sky in this. No promises. No ledger sheets that don't add up," said Mr. Florio, who took to the stump to tout his plan to expand the Economic Development Authority, a state-run agency that guarantees bank loans for business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio said that his plans for the authority were only a slice of his economic blueprint for the state over the next four years. But it provided a large enough target for the Whitman campaign.</p>
        <p>"I don't consider that an economic recovery plan; it is more like the Economic Development Authority's annual report," said Carl Golden, spokesman for the Whitman campaign. "It does not go to the issue of the state budget. It does not go to the issue of budget cutting or raising taxes. Distributing the E.D.A. annual report is a woefully pitiful response." Groping for Political Ground</p>
        <p>Polls have shown that the economy and jobs are among the major concerns for New Jersey voters, and Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio have maneuvered furiously over the last week to gain political ground on the issues.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Florio broke no new ground with his Economic Development Authority plan, his choice of a fairly limited program enables him to contrast himself with Mrs. Whitman, whom he has accused of promising far more than she can deliver. Mr. Florio's program also gives her very little to shoot at.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman released her economic blueprint on Sept. 21 and spent the last week challenging Mr. Florio to do the same. Trumpeting a plan drawn up by a group of fiscal, tax and business advisers, Mrs. Whitman promised to cut taxes by nearly $1.5 billion, pare the size of state government and to create 450,000 new jobs over the next four years.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Whitman has refused to give specifics about her economic plan, opening the way for nearly daily attacks from Mr. Florio and generally caustic criticism from newspaper editorial writers in the state. No Specific New Ideas</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio has not put forth any specific new ideas, either. Instead, he has pointed to his record over the last three years. He has cited public works projects such as the Atlantic City Convention Center and a 20,000-seat expansion of the Rutgers University football stadium, tough enforcement of environmental laws (which he said helped spur a business boom at the New Jersey Shore) and the Economic Development Authority.</p>
        <p>The Economic Development Authority is one of the major pillars of Mr. Florio's economic plan. Since he took office, the authority's financing has grown from $95 million in 1990 to $579 million in 1992. President Clinton borrowed some ideas from the authority while putting together his program to provide community loans for small businesses, the Federal Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio said that over the last four years it had invested more than $1 billion in financing in more than 500 projects and had created nearly 30,000 jobs. Authority officials say the default rate -- bad debts that the taxpayers ultimately have to pay -- has been less than 4 percent, which they say is much lower than the comparable rate at commercial banks.</p>
        <p>"The Economic Development Authority was idling in neutral when we took office," Mr. Florio said. "Today it's in high gear and there are entrepreneurs all over the state who can tell you how much thye have been helped."</p>
        <p>Over the next four years, Mr. Florio said his administration through the E.D.A. would provide $50 million for one-year small business loans at interest rates of 3 to 5 percent, and $10 million for local development agencies to finance small business loans of $10,000 to $50,000; $800 million for a statewide loan pool for small to medium businesses and a pool to enable them to trade in the public bond market; $100 million to help New Jersey businesses obtain financing to sell overseas, and $25 million for a public schools loan assistance program.</p>
