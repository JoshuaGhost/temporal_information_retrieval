        <p>John Smith, the Labor Party leader, narrowly won a knockdown, drag-out struggle today to weaken the hold of Britain's unions over the Labor Party.</p>
        <p>Reformers within the party were convinced that the move was necessary to improve the party's image and so help propel it out of the wilderness of opposition to the ruling Conversatives where it has languished for 14 years.</p>
        <p>The issue of the relationship with the trade unions, which founded the party in 1900, has dominated the party's annual conference in this seaside resort since Monday. It turned into a major test of authority for Mr. Smith, the 55-year-old Scottish barrister who won the party leadership after Labor's defeat by the Tories in April, 1992.</p>
        <p>Fulfilling a pledge made by Mr. Smith 16 months ago, the party leadership pushed through a series of changes in its rules to diminish the union's role in conference voting, in choosing the party leader and deputy leader and in selecting candidates to run for Parliament. Unions Oppose Changes</p>
        <p>Lined up against him were some of the most powerful unions in the country, including the Transport and General Workers Union, with over a million members, and the General Municipal and Boilmakers Union, with 800,000.</p>
        <p>The only contentious issue was over the procedure for choosing candidates for Parliament. The anti-reform unions wanted to retain some variation of the old system, in which locals of affiliated unions controlled blocs of up to 40 percent of the nominating votes in each district.</p>
        <p>Now, the candidates will be selected by local party organizations on a straightforward one-member, one-vote basis. As a consolation to the unions, and also as a means of expanding total party membership beyond the current figure of 279,530, the party will make it easier for union members to join.</p>
        <p>Those who already pay a "political levy" of $2.50 a year will be able to become full members by paying an additional $4.50 a year. The "political levy" raised by unions brings in $7.27 million of the party's annual revenues of $12.75 million and has long been the unions' main argument for claiming a central role in party affairs. Voters View of Labor</p>
        <p>But the notion that the party was in thrall to union "barons," epitomized by the image of union leaders holding up cards to register huge blocs of votes at conferences, was widely thought to have hurt the party's standing with middle class British voters.</p>
        <p>"The fact is that the public out there conceives of the Labor Party as being led by the nose by the unions," said Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineers and Electrical Union, which supported Mr. Smith's gamble to change the rules. In the end, the key issue of the rule change -- allowing parliamentary candidates to be selected by one-member, one vote -- squeaked by with 47.5 percent in favor to 44.3 percent against.</p>
        <p>The 38 unions that are affiliated with the Labor Party have a membership of 4.6 million. But membership in the unions has been declining. And partly as a result of changes during the Conservative Governments of Margaret Thatcher, the unions are not the force in national life that they were in the immediate postwar years.</p>
