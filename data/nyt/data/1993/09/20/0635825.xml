        <p>The New York City Opera's production of Michael Tippett's "Midsummer Marriage" was not a success, but its very existence is a moral triumph of sorts. In the midst of a 50th-anniversary season more apprehensive than celebratory, Christopher Keene, the company's general director, has made room for the new, the neglected, the unusual and the troublesome. Mr. Keene has only occasionally had the resources, concrete and human, to do these operas well. He also knows they are bad for business.</p>
        <p>So in one way or another, the failure of "The Midsummer Marriage" was built in from the start: either failure in terms of operatic quality or failure in terms of audience response, and in this case both. Admirable goals and self-defeat have been frequent partners during the City Opera's history. To use the old expression, the company can't win for losing, and to reverse the thought, losses like this one can be made to seem like victories.</p>

        <p>The New York City Opera's production of Michael Tippett's "Midsummer Marriage" was not a success, but its very existence is a moral triumph of sorts. In the midst of a 50th-anniversary season more apprehensive than celebratory, Christopher Keene, the company's general director, has made room for the new, the neglected, the unusual and the troublesome. Mr. Keene has only occasionally had the resources, concrete and human, to do these operas well. He also knows they are bad for business.</p>
        <p>So in one way or another, the failure of "The Midsummer Marriage" was built in from the start: either failure in terms of operatic quality or failure in terms of audience response, and in this case both. Admirable goals and self-defeat have been frequent partners during the City Opera's history. To use the old expression, the company can't win for losing, and to reverse the thought, losses like this one can be made to seem like victories.</p>
        <p>If many of its successes have been ambiguous, one is clearly not and that is the house's ability to nurture young American singers and send the truly gifted among them off to larger international careers. One of its major problems is straightforward too: the New York State Theater, which is unsuited for opera and even less so for most of the American musicals the house puts on. The public space is too big to permit intimacy. Stage, wings and backstage are too small, stifling opera's need to breathe with appropriate grandeur.</p>
        <p>High in this company's unwritten charter is the obligation to provide modest productions of old favorites. Five of this season's 14 operas are by Puccini; "Carmen," "The Mikado," "The Student Prince" and "Le Nozze di Figaro" surround them. Professional singers gain experience. Newcomers to opera receive the proper introductions. Aficionados on low budgets look and listen affordably. Yet barely 100 yards away are the same operas sumptuously produced by the Metropolitan Opera. Comparisons that ought not to be made inevitably are. As a result, intentionally modest productions are criticized for not being more than they were meant to be.</p>
        <p>Daily grind, underrehearsed second casts and routine repertory produce sleepy performances, and they in turn can send potential converts to opera fleeing from the hall. But Mr. Keene has wisely addressed the "old chestnut" syndrome by re-outfitting popular favorites with brighter productions. In the case of the original-version "Madama Butterfly," in which Puccini's ugly Americans are restored to their original nastiness, the company has created something fascinating out of something shopworn.</p>
        <p>A less solvable problem at the City Opera is the intransigent mediocrity of its orchestra, which can be induced by the right conductor to play familiar music fairly well, but which, when faced with Mr. Tippett's uneven metric movement, is either unable to play together or does not care to. The house's administration has quietly addressed this anomaly for years but is largely frustrated by a militant musicians' union that fights dismissals fiercely. Thus the No. 2 opera company in what may be the cultural capital of the world is automatically diminished no matter how good the singer or how effective the production.</p>
        <p>Most Broadway shows are lost in this cave of a theater. Players onstage are remote, and the antidote, swollen electronic amplification, turns solutions into new problems.</p>
        <p>Now look at the rest of this season: the brave world of Hugo Weisgall's "Esther," "Marilyn," by Ezra Laderman, and Lukas Foss's "Griffelkin," all world premieres of American works. There have been Busoni's "Doktor Faustus" and Schoenberg's "Moses und Aron" in the recent past and this year "The Midsummer Marriage," a piece not many of us have seen before.</p>
        <p>"The Midsummer Marriage" is not an important opera, but it is sometimes a beautiful one. Its marriage of orchestral movement to stage movement and its delicate, economical instrumental sound date from an earlier phase in Mr. Tippett's career and remain blessedly distant from his heroic if clumsy struggles with huge musical forces and cosmic moral schemes.</p>
        <p>"The Midsummer Marriage" is an opera of ideas -- or better, of spiritual impulses. Not much happens. So its Manichaean debate between light and dark can hold our attention only with vivid, precise orchestra playing and with brilliant stage pictures. The libretto straddles the border between high-minded whimsy and silliness. Only first-class execution can rescue it from the latter.</p>
        <p>A Tuesday performance -- five days after the first -- was, not surprisingly, ill attended. Fear of (or boredom with) the new may have discouraged general audiences, and there was at least one devastating review of opening night's performance. The City Opera depends perhaps more heavily on reviews than the Met or the New York Philharmonic across the plaza.</p>
        <p>To sit amid the empty seats was to move from sympathy to gratitude to sadness and finally exasperation. Francesca Zambello's frugal production could not summon the resources to keep this fragile piece aloft. Despite Act II's interesting dance sequence, sensory deprivation -- a hardscrabble dullness -- discouraged Mr. Tippett's attempts at magic. The orchestra's playing in Act I was crude to the point of rebelliousness. Mr. Keene, a better visionary than he is a conductor, seemed scarcely in control. One was torn. Was it better to see and hear this opera in failed circumstances or sit at home and imagine what it might be?</p>
        <p>Having settled that question, listeners might move on to ask themselves this: Who else in this great musical headquarters of the world is going to put on "Die Soldaten" or "The Midsummer Marriage"? The tiny Manhattan companies operating hand-to-mouth out of of high school auditoriums might have attempted the latter 10 years ago, but these frail organisms dwindle with every year. Who else in New York is going to give a middle-income opera public the basic repertory?</p>
        <p>The faults in these enterprises must be seen clearly and acknowledged. But we might also look beyond the intractable structural problems and the lapses in quality; mix understanding with esthetic rectitude. The New York City Opera stands between us and a large blank space in New York's musical life. It is what we have and we might learn to cherish its failures as much as its successes.</p>
