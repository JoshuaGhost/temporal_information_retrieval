        <p>In the two weeks since the news broke that the P.L.O. and the Israelis were negotiating a peace agreement, the Palestinian refugee camps and souks of Damascus have become a caldron of intrigue and argument.</p>
        <p>Here, among the narrow streets where the Palestinian movement's most militant opposition groups maintain their offices, the question of the moment is: what can or should be done to sabotage the deal wrought by Yasir Arafat and Israel?</p>
        <p>Despite a torrent of angry words and even threats, the strategy of those opposed to the Arafat plan seems far from clear. Not only are the 10 Damascus-based groups, whose organizations span the entire spectrum of Palestinian politics, from Marxism to Muslim fundamentalism, unable to agree among themselves, but their capacity to challenge Mr. Arafat inside the occupied territories remains doubtful.</p>
        <p>So far, the so-called rejectionist organizations -- who claim to have large numbers of adherents within the occupied territories -- have found themselves largely isolated within the Arab world, since governments from the Persian Gulf to the River Jordan have gone on record as supporting Mr. Arafat's initiative, if only as a first, tentative step toward a larger Middle East settlement.</p>
        <p>More important, even the militants' Syrian hosts have given no indication what kind of leeway, if any, they will allow the opposition groups. Until now, Syria has steered a carefully neutral public course on the Israeli-Palestinian accord, saying only that the Palestinians must do what they think best for them. Golan May Be a Factor</p>
        <p>Western diplomats here argue that how soon and how comfortably President Hafez al-Assad is drawn into a satisfactory agreement of his own with Israel for the return of the Golan Heights may well be the most important factor in determining whether he gives the Damascus-based radicals free rein to confront Mr. Arafat's legitimacy openly.</p>
        <p>For the Palestinian radicals, who have for years become accustomed to the patronage and at least tacit support of Syria, the current situation is worrying. "The future is not certain at all," said Daoud Talhami, an official of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, one of the most radical groups within the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>"In two or three years, Israel might have diplomatic relations with several Arab counties," Mr. Talhami said. "It may have solved its border problems with Syria and its neighbors, and the Palestinian people could be left in a weakened position, to contend for themselves with Israel."</p>
        <p>Looking for an Arab sponsor, Nayef Hawatmeh, the head of the Democratic Front, and George Habash, leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, were reported to be meeting today with Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya, one of only two Arab Governments that have gone on record as opposing the accord, in addition to non-Arab Iran. P.L.O. Aide in Baghdad</p>
        <p>The other is Iraq, which itself remains isolated within the Arab world following the Persian Gulf war. Farouk Kaddoumi, the P.L.O. foreign policy spokesman, who refused to support the Palestinian-Israeli accord, is currently visiting Baghdad.</p>
        <p>Dr. Habash and his fellow radicals and Mr. Kaddoumi argue that Mr. Arafat has sold the Palestinian people short by closing a deal for limited self-government, first in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho.</p>
        <p>While the plan provides for autonomy to be extended over time throughout most of the occupied territories, critics here say there is nothing in it offering hope for the creation of a separate Palestinian state, nor does it address what will happen to the more than three million people who now live across the Palestinian diaspora, many of whom are living as refugees, stateless people in neighboring Arab states and yearning to return someday to what they insist is their land.</p>
        <p>Still, the Popular Front and the Democratic Front, the largest of the radical groups, have each gone out of their way to say they want to avoid a Palestinian civil war. Accord Will Defeat Itself</p>
        <p>For Mr. Talhami and others, the best thing the opponents have going for them are the internal contradictions inherent in the accord, which they believe will provoke widespread popular unrest in the occupied territories, with or without the agitation of Palestinians in Damascus or elsewhere.</p>
        <p>"I do not think it is a question of us stirring up the people," said Mr. Talhami, whose group has been one of those actively involved in supporting the five-year-long uprising in the occupied territories. "If you study the accord, you can see it clearly: the opposition will continue to come from the people inside."</p>
        <p>As an example, he asked what will happen the first time a Palestinian attacks an Israeli in East Jerusalem, say, and then takes refuge in Jericho, where the police functions will be in the hands of Mr. Arafat's men. "I do not imagine anyone will stand for the Palestinian police turning the man over to Israel," said Mr. Talhami.</p>
        <p>The various Palestinian factions are, in the meantime, having problems agreeing among themselves what to do.</p>
        <p>The militant Islamic group, Hamas, for example, one of two Palestinian organizations made up of Muslim fundamentalists, has called for convening a Palestinian congress in Yemen to seek a new Palestinian leadership from among those opposed to the accord. But the Popular Front and Democratic Front, whose own leftist agenda contrasts sharply with the arch-conservative Muslims, have indicated that such a meeting is premature.</p>
        <p>There have also been hints that the groups disagree on tactics. In Beirut, an aide to Dr. Habash warned earlier this month that Mr. Arafat should beware the same fate of Anwar el-Sadat, the Egyptian President who was assassinated by Islamic militants in 1981, two years after making peace with Israel. Others have argued that direct attacks on Mr. Arafat are out of the question.</p>
        <p>Another unanswered question is the degree of support the militants themselves can claim. On Monday, for example, the day the P.L.O.-Israeli agreement was signed in Washington, a march staged to protest Mr. Arafat's initiative drew between 5,000 and 10,000 protesters to the Yarmouk Palestinian neighborhood south of Damascus.</p>
        <p>The anger among some, like Saeed Atawee, a local pharmacist, seemed to be keenly felt. "Yasir Arafat is finished," said Mr. Atawee, jerking his finger across his neck like the blade of a knife. "We cannot forgive that he has broken with the people." Majority Ignore Protest</p>
        <p>Yet, just a few blocks away, on the main road through an adjoining refugee camp, the protest was ignored, and the streets were nearly impassable with shoppers and vendors crowding the market.</p>
        <p>There are about 300,000 to 400,000 Palestinians here, and United Nations documents indicate their living standards tend to be higher than in Lebanon, where a nearly equal number live.</p>
        <p>While Syria has long provided a base for several radical groups, their numbers grew after 1982, when Israel invaded Lebanon and forced the Palestinian leadership to leave Beirut.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Arafat took his organization to Tunis, Mr. Assad's guarantee of sanctuary to the more militant groups allowed Syria to claim a special role as protector of the Palestinian cause. But diplomats say Mr. Assad must now calculate whether to clamp down on these more militant groups, if he thinks it means Israel will negotiate for the return of the Golan Heights.</p>
        <p>But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel suggested today that his patience was limited with Mr. Assad's sometimes ambiguous policies in the region, including the fact he continues to give what Mr. Rabin called "cover and aid" to Palestinian groups opposed to the new accord.
