        <p>The Japanese Government is expected to announce on Thursday its third program in a year to stimulate the country's slumping economy. But economists are already predicting that the package might be too small to make much difference.</p>
        <p>The package is expected to be valued at about 5 trillion yen, about $47 billion, and will consist of public works spending, low-cost housing loans and tax incentives for businesses. The details of such programs tend to change until the program is announced.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has been pinning much of his hopes for revitalizing the economy on deregulation to bring about new business activities, and on passing to consumers the benefits of the strong yen in the form of lower prices for imports. Theoretically, lower prices would leave consumers with more money to spend.</p>
        <p>But such efforts are not likely to have a short-term effect; and with Japan's economy seeming to worsen again, the Government has been pressed to come up with a more traditional fiscal stimulus package.</p>
        <p>Japan's gross national product for the period from April to June is expected to have shrunk from the previous quarter, a sign that the economy is slipping into recession again. And a survey released by the Bank of Japan on Friday showed that business sentiment was sinking to its lowest level in nearly two decades. No Miracles Expected</p>
        <p>The new package follows a 10.7 trillion yen package announced in August 1992, and a 13.2 trillion yen package announced in April.</p>
        <p>Those two efforts, which consisted largely of spending on public works, helped prop up the economy but could not by themselves lead to a recovery. The new effort is not expected to work miracles either, especially considering it is less than half the size of the previous two.</p>
        <p>"It will prevent the bottom from falling further, but I think it will have only a limited impact," said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, a senior economist in the Tokyo office of Morgan Stanley &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>The plans, as leaked to the press in Japan over the weekend, do not call for an income tax cut, which many business leaders have advocated as a way of stimulating spending by consumers. The Finance Ministry has resisted a tax cut because it would probably lead to a national budget deficit.</p>
        <p>But the pressure for a tax cut of about 5 trillion yen continues to mount, and it is possible that the promise of such a cut will be made this week or later this year. A cut in income tax might be put into effect quickly in return for a later increase in a consumption tax. In this way, a tax cut would be justified as part of a long-term reform of the taxation system to reduce the country's reliance on income taxes. Disaster Relief Possible</p>
        <p>The program to be announced on Thursday is expected to consist of about 1 trillion yen, or roughly $10 billion, in public works spending for projects like facilities for the handicapped or art museums. There might also be several billion dollars more allocated for disaster relief after a big earthquake in northern Japan and several strong typhoons.</p>
        <p>In addition to the public works spending, more than 1 trillion yen will be allocated to increase low-interest loans for home buyers. Economists say there is a pent-up demand for better housing from the Japanese people who live in cramped quarters.</p>
        <p>"Getting the housing sector moving is the most effective way of getting the economy moving," said Geoffrey Barker, an economist for Baring Securities in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Many economists said the public works spending had reached its limit as a tool for stimulating the economy. Spending by the Government accounts for only 7 percent of the gross national product. The economy will not improve until consumers and companies spend more, which will not happen until consumers overcome their fear of job losses that has encouraged them to save, and companies work off inventories and excess production capacity.</p>
