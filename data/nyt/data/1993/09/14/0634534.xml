        <p>Hyperion announced yesterday that it would publish a manuscript presented as the diary of Jack the Ripper, even though another publisher, Warner Books, asserted last week that the diary was fake and canceled its own publication plans.</p>
        <p>"This is a fascinating document, and the questions it raises are equally absorbing," Robert Miller, the vice president and publisher of Hyperion, said in a statement. Referring to an independent analysis saying that the diaries had been written between 1909 and 1933 -- not in the 1880's, when Jack the Ripper was terrorizing London -- Mr. Miller said: "Certainly, if it is a hoax, it is a very old and elaborate one -- who did write this -- and why?"</p>

        <p>The book, which is to include the text of the diary and a discussion of whether it is authentic, is to be published in October. In addition, Smith Gryphon, a British publisher, said it would go ahead with its own plans to publish the book.</p>
