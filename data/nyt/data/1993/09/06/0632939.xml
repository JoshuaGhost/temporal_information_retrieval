        <p>Thursday, the day school was supposed to begin, looks pretty good for the Watson family of Brooklyn: Terry Watson, a 45-year-old music therapist, has to work only three hours that day, so she figures she will take Peter, her 8-year-old son, along with her. For a few hours, Adam, 11, could fend for himself.</p>
        <p>Friday gets trickier: Mrs. Watson's schedule that day prevents Peter from going with her again, so he might have to go with his father, David, to his job at Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a financial information company. But Mr. Watson is uncertain how the bosses would feel about a third grader, whose temporary snake tattoo is flaking off his tanned arm, mingling with men in suits. So Peter could possibly go to work with Mrs. Watson's sister, or in a pinch, to the office of Mrs. Watson's mother. No one is sure. Rush for Child Care</p>
        <p>Adam, however, would likely stay with a friend, Josh Pomerantz. Josh's mother is a public school teacher, and in this time of confusion and frustration brought on by the asbestos crisis and the delay of school, she will definitely be at home.</p>
        <p>"I don't know," Mrs. Watson said this weekend at the family's home in Ditmas Park. "Maybe I'll send them all to Mayor Dinkins's house."</p>

        <p>Thursday, the day school was supposed to begin, looks pretty good for the Watson family of Brooklyn: Terry Watson, a 45-year-old music therapist, has to work only three hours that day, so she figures she will take Peter, her 8-year-old son, along with her.

        <p>"I don't know," Mrs. Watson said this weekend at the family's home in Ditmas Park. "Maybe I'll send them all to Mayor Dinkins's house."</p>
        <p>Around New York City, nearly a million children cheered last week at the news that school's opening would be pushed back at least until Sept. 20, as workers try to complete the monumental task of inspecting and cleaning up schools with exposed asbestos. But for parents and some students, the delay means trouble: a rush for child care, a few days off from work, worry about missing classes as exams for college or prep school loom or the prolonged anxiety of a new school year.</p>
        <p>And among teachers, there is confusion about how the asbestos inspections are progressing at their schools, long-term concern about their health and more immediate questions about their paychecks. With little definite information but plenty of word-of-mouth, many are outraged at how the Board of Education has handled what some call the asbestos mess. From Inconvenience to Chaos</p>
        <p>"What are we supposed to believe?" asked Claire E. Sylvan, a teacher at International High School in Long Island City. "The central board has done a typically ridiculous job informing people. It's unbelievable that they waited until three days before people were supposed to report to tell them not to report."</p>
        <p>Until school opens again, pools will stay open, summer recreation programs will be extended, museums and zoos will offer free admission. But in ways large and small, the postponement -- the first in two decades -- has disrupted the rhythms and routines of hundreds of thousands of families. For some, the delay is inconvenient. For others, like the Watsons, it is a logistical nightmare. A Mother's Worries  Disabled Son Will Miss Therapy</p>
        <p>Camelia Flye loves her three boys dearly but is quickly reaching the limit of tolerance. An unemployed single mother, Ms. Flye remembers a hot day in July when she passed through the entrance of her building in Morningside Heights -- scribbled with graffiti announcing "Crime Pays" -- and walked up five flights of stairs to her apartment.</p>
        <p>Inside were more children than she could count. They were everywhere, listening to hip-hop, playing video games, being as loud as children are. The possibility of two more weeks, maybe more, of her children out of school in their cramped apartment, seems like more than she can take.</p>
        <p>"I'm telling you, I'm looking for a rest," said Ms. Flye, 45, who moved to New York City 20 years ago from St. Louis. "With three boys, it gets to be kind of rambunctious around here."</p>
        <p>Tired as she is, her main concern is her 10-year-old son, Jamil, who has emotional problems and is on medication for hyperactivity. He was enrolled this year at Public School 188 in a new program for children with special needs. And like many parents of children with disabilities, Ms. Flye worries about the effects of his missing two weeks of therapy.</p>
        <p>As she sees it, the recent problem is just one more sign of neglect in the public schools, a problem that she said ranges from a poor curriculum for special needs children to lead. Now it is asbestos that endangers already tenuous futures, she said.</p>
        <p>"Nothing surprises me anymore with the schools," said Ms. Flye, whose other children are 11 and 17 years old. "Most public schools are dominated by blacks and Latinos, so who cares? Most of us are poor, so who really cares?"</p>
        <p>"What I'm hoping is that when school starts, the schools are safe, that the repairs are done and nothing like this happens again," she said. "Because what has happened is like attempted murder on children." Fears of Two Teachers  Years in Classroom With Asbestos</p>
        <p>Edie and Shel Haas grew up in the Bronx and have happily taught public school there nearly their entire adult lives. Now, a week after asbestos inspectors sealed off 18 rooms in Mrs. Haas's elementary school in Parkchester, she is looking back with a little worry at her 26 years there.</p>
        <p>"A lot of adults have been there for a very long time," said Mrs. Haas, 55, who seems concerned, yet determined to brush it off like a good New Yorker. "I don't have the breath that I had 26 years ago. It could be age. It could be asbestos. We can't tell. I also have allergies I never had. Is that because of asbestos? We don't know."</p>
        <p>Her health had never been an issue until last week, when the rooms at Community School 47, including room 213, where she taught for eight years, were closed because of asbestos. She is "not terribly worried," but outraged because she said the central board had issued a report about asbestos in the school two years ago.</p>
        <p>"All of a sudden to make this big thing, it's ridiculous," she said, sitting in her home in Fort Lee, N.J. "Everybody knew about it and that's making people angry."</p>
        <p>"This is part of a larger problem -- the upkeep of the schools," said Mr. Haas, 63, who last year was an acting assistant principal at Intermediate School 116.</p>
        <p>The delay has not been a problem for the Haases, who said they had a relaxing summer of trips and visits with their three grandchildren. But like most teachers, they wonder how it will affect their students. Mr. Haas is concerned especially about students who must take the Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Tests in October.</p>
        <p>"It hasn't inconvenienced us," Mrs. Haas said. "But we're also in a state of limbo. When can we get into our rooms? When can we start our planning sessions? How are the kids going to react? That's our worry now." A Mother's Doubts  Size of Problem Fully Recognized?</p>
        <p>This much was certain as Lillian Lopez set out on a school shopping expedition with her two sons on Saturday: Julian Albert, 12, needed a pair of high-tops, and Conan Albert, 8, needed scissors and construction paper. Less clear, after a roller-coaster week for Ms. Lopez, was exactly when school would start.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lopez, who lives in Sunset Park, is a member of the Parents' Asbestos Steering Committee, a group that attends meetings of the officials directing the inspection. Last week, she received dozens of calls from frightened mothers and fathers. But even she had few answers.</p>
        <p>"I seriously doubt that schools will open Sept. 20," she said as she ate at a diner with her sons before going shopping. "I've been to all the meetings, and let me tell you, nobody realizes the magnitude of this problem."</p>
        <p>It is a problem that affects Ms. Lopez, a single working mother, as much as anyone. Even before the asbestos crisis, she wondered: Could she beg a friend to take them swimming? Could her daughter Sheri, 16, buy groceries and cook dinner?</p>
        <p>"Now it's 100 times worse," said Ms. Lopez, director of a group providing technical assistance to parent groups in the city. "I can't believe that school's not going to start yet."</p>
        <p>And she is not sure what to do for the next two weeks. She cannot afford a baby sitter so she may take a few days off, or take them to work or find spaces in a public recreation program. Either way, it will not be easy.</p>
        <p>But her sons are overjoyed. As Julian piled french fries on top of his pizza burger, he ticked off his plans.  "I can go to work with my mom and write stories on her computer," said Julian, an eighth grader at I.S. 136.</p>
        <p>"I can watch TV," shouted Conan, who will be in third grade at P.S. 1. "I can mess around!"</p>
        <p>By the time he finished eating, Julian had second thoughts. "If you want to know the truth, I'm sick of being with Conan," he said, giving his brother a gentle shove. "I'd rather be in a war than stay home with him for two more weeks." A Teacher's Concerns  Will Postponement Affect Paycheck?</p>
        <p>Stacia Robbins, a teacher at International High School, was pleased with a two-week orientation for new students, many of whom do not speak English. Youngsters from countries like Poland, China, Colombia and Russia started out shy and withdrawn, but by Friday, the last day, they seemed comfortable.</p>
        <p>Then she had to tell them that school would not start for at least two weeks. "They were disappointed," she said. "I think it's hard on the kids because they are psyched up."</p>
        <p>But Ms. Robbins has her own worries: A payroll problem has held up money she earned teaching summer school, and she has to pay $500 for a course to keep up her state teaching certificate. And she doesn't know if the delay in school's start will also mean a delay in her paycheck.</p>
        <p>"I have to pay this and I don't have the money now," said Ms. Robbins, 55, who began teaching eight years ago. "I'm concerned about our paychecks. I'm a single mother and I live check to check."</p>
        <p>Susan Amlung, a spokeswoman for the United Federation of Teachers, said teachers will still be paid as if school were in session. But Ms. Robbins's apprehension seemed to underscore the general lack of information echoed by parents and teachers alike about the asbestos inspections and when school will begin.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robbins, who lives in Park Slope, counts herself generally lucky in this problem. Financial worries aside, it means she will get to spend a little extra time with her 15-year-old daughter, Alycen, who attends Edward R. Murrow High School. But she hopes the delay does not drag on.</p>
        <p>"I just want them to stick with the 20th as the starting date and not move it back again," she said. If so, she said, "it would make everybody really angry and really crazy." Student's Boredom  Eager to Return To Math and Plays</p>
        <p>Andrea Vialva, 12, has had it with summer. She is plenty upset that she will not be returning on Thursday to I.S. 227 in East Elmhurst, Queens, where she gets good grades, likes math and participates in plays.</p>
        <p>"I want to get back to school," said Andrea, of Jamaica, Queens, who will be going into seventh grade. During summer vacation, she said, "you have fun for like two weeks and then you start getting bored."</p>
        <p>Her parents are also upset, not for boredom, but because they want their daughter to get the best education possible. Her mother, Anne, said she thinks especially about the entrance exams to preparatory school, which Andrea plans to take to get into St. Francis Prep in Queens.</p>
        <p>The exams are a year away, but with competition stiff from other students, some in parochial schools, which are not closed because of asbestos, Mrs. Vialva feels that every day of instruction counts.</p>
        <p>"My whole concern is that she gets all that's due to her in the seventh grade," said Mrs. Vialva, a native of Trinidad. The family also has two other children, both in college.</p>
        <p>The delay in school has also thrown off Mrs. Vialva's own extensive preparations for school. She already bought her daughter a new pair of dress shoes, new Nike sneakers, two book bags (one for strength and durability, the other because it was a little more fashionable), two flannel shirts and six pairs of pants. She also had to change plans because she intended to take off the first day of school to get to know her daughter's bus driver.</p>
        <p>Now she said she feels a sinking confidence in public schools, which she said have long been the victim of neglect and poor administration. Echoing the opinion of many parents, she said asbestos is just one problem.</p>
        <p>"I blame the whole school system," she said. "They had the whole summer to take care of this. It's nothing that just happened yesterday."</p>
