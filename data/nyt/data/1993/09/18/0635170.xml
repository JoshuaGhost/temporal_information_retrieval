        <p>After 23 years on the run, Katherine Ann Power has given herself up to authorities, ready to face punishment for a crime she committed as a student radical in 1970.</p>
        <p>Ms. Power drove the getaway car for a bank robbery in which a policeman was killed. Along with her comrades, she planned to use the money to buy explosives to sabotage trains carrying military weapons and to help arm the Black Panther Party.</p>
        <p>It may be hard, especially for Americans older than Ms. Power and for those born later, to understand how a middle-class girl from Brandeis could participate in something so patently amoral and reckless. But for a narrow group of her contemporaries, her reappearance must stir some unsettling memories.</p>
        <p>It seems ludicrous now, but in those cynical, angry and weirdly romantic times, among a small but influential political subculture such acts seemed logical.</p>
        <p>It was a subculture formed by the meeting of disaffected middle-class students and angry African-Americans, both groups newly politicized and fed up with what they saw as the futility of nonviolent protests. The young whites had failed to stop the Vietnam War, and faced the threat of being drafted into a conflict they abhorred. For the young black revolutionaries, the murder of Martin Luther King Jr. was the death knell of nonviolence. They felt that the legal victories of the civil rights movement made no difference to the residents of urban ghettos.</p>
        <p>Inspired by revolutionary movements in Latin America and East Asia, the two groups briefly came together and shared their anger. They lived in armed "collectives." They built bombs. They planned acts of sabotage. They played at politics. Now it all seems repellent and hard to fathom.</p>
        <p>Those "revolutionaries" are grown-ups now, most of them responsible citizens. Many, aghast at their own excesses, don't like to talk about those days. Some of them took years to fight their way back to faith in America. Some made uneasy compromises. Many still hover at the edges of society, unsure where they belong.</p>
        <p>For Katherine Power, exile finally became unbearable. Eluding punishment, she found only depression. As her mother said, "She's been in prison all her life." Now, paradoxically, her escape from that prison will lead her to jail.</p>
        <p>Her crime must not be made light of, but she can be understood. Not all the casualties of the 60's served in Vietnam. Some, like Officer Walter Schroeder, were victims of the era's lunatic "revolutionaries." Others walk among us, still trying to make sense of the past, or to pay for it.</p>
