        <p>Edward Baquet Sr., founder of Eddie's, one of New Orleans's most popular creole restaurants, died on Tuesday at University Hospital there. He was 71.</p>
        <p>The cause was leukemia, a disease he fought for a decade, family members said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baquet opened the family-style restaurant in 1966 in Gentilly, a working-class neighborhood in the old part of New Orleans, and operated it with his wife, the former Myrtle Romano, and other family members, until 1984.</p>
        <p>He then turned over its direction to a son, Wayne, and his wife, Janet. They expanded the restaurant and added two others.</p>
        <p>Edward Baquet promoted the civil rights campaigns against segregated businesses in the early 1960's. When he was working at a restaurant called the Chicken Coop owned by his aunt and uncle, he allowed young demonstrators to eat and keep their placards there.</p>
        <p>After serving in the Army in the 1940's, he went to work for the Postal Service. He left to open his first restaurant.</p>
        <p>The New Orleans chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People honored him with its annual award in 1991 for his support of the civil rights movement.</p>
        <p>Besides his wife and son Wayne, he is survived by four other sons, Edward Jr., of Houston, Terry and Rudy, both of New Orleans, and Dean, of New York City, a reporter and editor at The New York Times.</p>
