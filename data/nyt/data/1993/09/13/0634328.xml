        <p>A 14-year-old boy was fatally wounded by a gunshot in the chest at a home in Brooklyn yesterday by a young man who told the police that a handgun he was showing the boy had discharged accidentally.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Frances Haimeck, a police spokeswoman, said the victim, Manuel Gonzalez, whose address was unknown, was shot just before 4 P.M. in a bedroom at the home of a friend at 506 Elton Street in East New York. He was dead on arrival at Brookdale Hospital.</p>
        <p>The man who admitted firing the gun, Benito Jimenez, 20, of 305 Jerome Street, Brooklyn, told investigators he removed the bullet clip and thought the gun was empty, but one cartridge remained in the chamber and discharged when he pulled the trigger. Mr. Jimenez was taken into custody pending charges to be determined by the Brooklyn District Attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Haimeck said it was unclear who owned the pistol or how it came into Mr. Jimenez's possession. The police found the gun and a .32 caliber revolver in a paper bag in the yard at the home, where the victim and Mr. Jimenez were visiting.</p>
