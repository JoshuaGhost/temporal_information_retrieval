        <p>It was early June, and Philippe de Montebello was navigating his way through the workmen's clutter of ladders and sawhorses inhabiting the new 19th-Century European Paintings and Sculpture Galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>"That is where 'The Hand of God' will be," said Mr. de Montebello, the museum's director, pointing to a diamond of parquet flooring where the celebrated Rodin bronze will stand.</p>
        <p>"And that is where the transom will not be," he said, pointing to a nearby archway.</p>
        <p>The transom? "The plans called for a beautiful, translucent, backlit transom," he said to a visitor. "But it blocked the vista of the art in the next rooms. I noticed it at 11 A.M." It was noon at the time. "As you can see, it is gone."</p>
        <p>The tale of the transom illustrates not only the clout of Mr. de Montebello but also the improvisational quality of the most ambitious internal renovation ever attempted at the Metropolitan, a renovation to be celebrated with a round of gala benefits beginning with a black-tie dinner for 400 people tonight. Taken as a whole, the project, which opens to the public on Sept. 21, represents, in effect, the creation of a museum within a museum, one that in some ways more resembles the Met at the turn of the century than the Met of today.</p>
        <p>The Met's collection of Romantic, Barbizon, Impressionist and Post-Impressionist works -- 350 paintings and 120 sculptures -- is now reinstalled in a suite of 21 elaborate, Beaux-Arts-style galleries on the second floor of the museum's south wing.</p>
        <p>The renovation, which took three years of planning and two years of reconstruction, cost $12.4 million. "The 19th-century galleries represent a total change," Mr. de Montebello said. "We tore out the floors, walls and ceilings, everything within the outer shell."</p>
        <p>The new, classically inspired galleries will replace the old Andre Meyer Galleries, a starkly modern 25,000-square-foot area designed by Kevin Roche, John Dinkeloo &amp; Associates that was to have been the last word in art display, but became something of an embarrassment, panned by some critics. There had been dissatisfaction with that gallery from 1980, when it opened, Mr. de Montebello said; it attempted to be flexible and open, with its seven tall movable partitions, erected in the sleek, cavernous spaces of the gallery, with its bright turquoise carpet.</p>
        <p>"The flexibility wasn't really flexible, since we never moved any of the partitions," he said. "They chopped up the space and people wandered around lost, trying to make sense of it all."</p>
        <p>The new space was designed by Gary Tinterow, Engelhard Curator of European Paintings at the museum, and David Harvey, senior exhibition designer, in collaboration with Roche, Dinkeloo. Some of the rooms will continue the name of the Andre Meyer Galleries; others will honor Leonore and Walter Annenberg, Iris and B. Gerald Cantor and the Met's important early donors, the Havemeyer family.</p>
        <p>"The art of the 19th century should be displayed in galleries similar in scale and design to those for which the artists created their pictures," Mr. Tinterow said, "classically proportioned rooms that are articulated with baseboards, wainscoting, cornices and coves."</p>
        <p>So he and Mr. Harvey re-created the configuration of the original gallery spaces designed by some of the musuem's earliest architects, Richard Morris Hunt and the firm of McKim, Mead &amp; White, as well as the work of John Russell Pope at the Frick Museum and the National Gallery of Art.</p>
        <p>The process of designing an ambitious museum gallery is often one of compromise with the unexpected. The happiest accommodation forced on the designers was the integration into the Metropolitan's own collection of the largest single gift of art made to any museum in over half a century. In March 1991, the publisher and philanthropist Walter H. Annenberg promised to bequeath to the museum paintings valued at from $700 million to $1 billion.</p>
        <p>The plans had already been dramatically reconfigured in 1990, when the Annenberg bequest became a possibility and later adjustments were necessary to cope with a further embarrassment of riches: last November, the Metropolitan acquired eight works by Manet, Degas, Pissarro, Morisot and Sisley. In June, van Gogh's "Wheat Field with Cypresses" was acquired for $57 million through the Annenberg Foundation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annenberg stipulated that his collection be exhibited in a group. The interpolation of the Annenberg Impressionists with those of the Met will be accomplished to the west of the central Manet gallery, in a grid of nine gallery rooms. Three Annenberg galleries will display 53 works by Cezanne, Gauguin, Manet, Matisse, Monet, Picasso, Renoir, Seurat, van Gogh and others; these galleries will be flanked by six other rooms displaying the museum's paintings by the same artists.</p>
        <p>Another unanticipated change was disappointing: the abandonment of the planned oval shape for the central Manet gallery. The ellipse, based on a gallery room in the Frick Collection, was to be the focus of the redesign, a visual representation of a central compass point from which visitors could head in any of four directions. Room for 16 Manets</p>
        <p>The plan was dropped because of space. "The oval would have been much too crowded," Mr. Tinterow said. "It would have been hard to hang on an oval, and we'd have lost a lot of linear footage."</p>
        <p>The compromise was a rectangular double gallery with enough wall space to accommodate 16 large-scale Manets. Set off by arched door frames, the Manet gallery is now the largest of the rooms, and still serves as the focal point of the new space.</p>
        <p>An additional $1 million was programmed into the galleries' original budget to pay for changes and refinements; so in altering the original plans, Mr. de Montebello said, the renovation has not gone over budget.</p>
        <p>Close to half the cost of the gallery was paid for by Mr. Annenberg, and a major part of the additional financing is believed to have come from the Cantor family and from Janice H. Levin, a New York businesswoman and philanthropist. Mr. Annenberg was not involved in the planning of the new galleries, although he saw the plans and approved of them. A Personal Involvement</p>
        <p>Mr. de Montebello describes his relationship to the evolving gallery as "as deep and personal daily involvement," not only as a former curator of European paintings but also because "I'm responsible," he said. "It's amazing how many things you notice: The door that's too wide, the exit sign that's too prominent, the electrician who put a thermostat where a painting should be -- not in the middle of my walls, thank you very much. The plans would never prepare you for this."</p>
        <p>A gallery cannot be designed in isolation from the rooms that surround it. Since primary access to the new galleries will be from the elevators and stairs on 81st Street, the Met has added Beaux-Arts detailing to the Greek and Roman Art Galleries. "We see the collections there as an antechamber," Mr. de Montebello said. "We realized that it would not be right to have this kind of classical architecture appearing out of nowhere."</p>
        <p>Although the hanging of paintings is but the final stage of the gallery design, it has taken the better part of five weeks to accomplish.</p>
        <p>"Hanging is the bread and butter of what we do," said Mr. Tinterow recently as he supervised a crew lifting phenomenally valuable Impressionist paintings from a "side truck," a padded, custom-built cart used to roll artworks from room to room.</p>
        <p>Three Monets were arrayed on the floor before him. "I'm not sure if you can get three paintings on this wall or not," he said. He asked the crew to move one Monet -- "The Japanese Bridge" -- to another wall. "Yes, I think it's too busy and too crowded in that corner."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tinterow was working from a 9-foot-by-5-foot model with scale-sized representations of the paintings and sculpture to be installed. The designers and Mr. de Montebello had spent dozens of hours working with the model's tiny reproductions of each of the 350 paintings and 120 sculptures planned for the galleries, studying them and photographing them in different configurations. By moving them from miniature wall to wall, they tried to anticipate the relationships not only among paintings within each room, but also sought to create harmonious vistas through the doorways between rooms.</p>
        <p>The model, created from architectural drawings, was also useful in melding the Annenberg collection with the Metropolitan's paintings in the adjoining galleries. It was also used to refine the working drawings in the later stages of the construction.</p>
        <p>By the end of the renovation Mr. de Montebello came to think of the sweaty evolution of design, construction and display as "very much an artistic process," he said. "A gallery can't simply be conceptualized. It must be observed, experienced, tinkered with. It re-invents itself every day."</p>
