        <p>An article on Sept. 25 about a study of women with silicone breast implants coated with polyurethane included an erroneous reference from the Food and Drug Administration to the presence of a substance called 2-toluene diamine, or TDA, in their bodies. (TDA has been found to cause cancer when fed to rats.) The study found small amounts in the women's urine, not in their blood. An agency spokeswoman, Betsy Adams, said, however, that the substance would not be in the urine if it had not also been in the blood.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated a finding about women without implants who were included in the study for comparison. Small amounts of the substance were found in the urine of some of them.</p>
