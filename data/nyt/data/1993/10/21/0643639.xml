        <p>The Western States Treasurers Association said yesterday that the National Association of State Treasurers should consider a policy that would call on treasurers to refuse campaign contributions from those involved in the municipal bond business, including large Wall Street firms.</p>
        <p>The policy was adopted at the association's annual meeting in San Diego. It comes after a series of municipal bond scandals helped push big Wall Street underwriters this week to adopt a voluntary ban on contributions made to win municipal bond business.</p>
        <p>To date many officials who can award the lucrative bond underwriting business have said they would continue to accept political contributions. But the move by California's State Treasurer, Kathleen Brown, to refuse such contributions and a push from the National Association of State Treasurers could change some minds.</p>
