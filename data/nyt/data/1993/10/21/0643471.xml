        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Partisans of the Clinton health care reforms, most of whom are closet single-payer advocates, have given up on the latter, because they say it is not "p.r." (politically realistic). They and the Clinton Administration might do well to heed the words of their own guru in the White House, Paul Starr, who in his "Social Transformation of American Medicine," wrote about the Medicare battle of 1964 as follows:</p>
        <p>Medicare "received the highest priority among Great Society programs. However, strategists for the bill, still smarting from past defeats by the  [ American Medical Association ] , were against expanding its provisions to include physicians' services or to cover any broader groups than the aged. At a time of expansive reform, they continued to back a measure framed in the more conservative 1950s." It took Representative Wilbur Mills, who paid attention to public opinion polls at the time, to include doctors' services and a program for the poor.</p>
        <p>Similarly today, the 80's are mercifully behind us, and as the commentator Kevin Phillips and others have noted, there is a backlash against that profligate decade and a demand for social reform arising from the more hostile economic climate of the 90's.</p>
        <p>It is not surprising in this new environment that more than 70 percent of the American people favor a universal, single-tier, single-payer system of national health insurance. It remains to be seen whether there are enough legislators with the courage and ingenuity to go beyond lip service to a Canadian-style plan and wage a serious fight for it. Otherwise we will never know the limits of the possible. JOHN V. WALSH, M.D. Professor of Physiology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center Worcester, Mass., Oct. 13, 1993</p>
