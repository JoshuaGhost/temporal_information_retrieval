        <p>GIULIANI</p>
        <p>The two mayoral candidates disagree over the format for a debate, so no face-to-face meeting has been scheduled. Rudolph W. Giuliani, at his campaign headquarters yesterday, again said he would not debate if the Conservative Party candidate, George J. Marlin, is included.</p>
        <p>"In Presidential campaigns 1- and 2-percent candidates are not allowed in the debates for the very simple reason that there is a precious little amount of time that you have for people to absorb issues. If you take one hour and you divide it by three, there is considerably less substance than if you divide it by two. And if you are going to start dividing precious air time, then you are going to have debates with five, six and seven people.</p>

        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>"Ross Perot had over 15 percent of the vote. And John Anderson in 1980 was kept out of the debate because his vote was below 15 percent and the networks determined that it would not be fair that a disproportionately large amount of time be spent on a candidate that low in the polls. There is absolutely no principle to what Dinkins is asking for. . . . What we are asking for is a debate that is a real debate, not a game, no chickens. No empty chairs. Not a bunch of soundbites. . . . I wish you'd put as much pressure on him as you put on me, to debate me one on one. Why won't he do that? After all, realistically, either David Dinkins or Rudolph Giuliani will be the next mayor of New York City. Why is he not showing up tomorrow night at the debates? He wants to bring Marlin along? Come on. You know that's a phony dodge."  DINKINS</p>
        <p>Following an endorsement by James Brady yesterday at John Jay College, Mr. Dinkins spoke to reporters on the subject of debating Mr.  Giuliani.</p>
        <p>"Mr. Giuliani doesn't want to come to a debate because he is afraid. He's afraid of me. At the Irish Forum, they give you the questions in advance, only six questions. Real simple, easy questions, if you have a position. He didn't show, presumably because Marlin was going to come. Now mind you, we're not even on the stage at the same time. They had another forum at St. Francis College, he failed to come. They had one on the environment, and he failed to come.</p>
        <p>"What is the big deal that he can't come and answer questions? He's the one who is afraid and frightened. He is not interested in a debate. He says that he doesn't want Marlin there because Marlin will attack him. I say were he not vulnerable, he wouldn't need to worry about being attacked. And moreover, the mayor of the City of New York must awaken each day to critiques and criticisms in a negative fashion. And if he can't handle one George Marlin, how can he hope to be mayor of the City of New York?</p>
        <p>"I come from a background of people who have been excluded. I don't believe in exclusion; I believe in inclusion."</p>
