        <p>While Vatican officials have not publicly gone as far as the C.I.A. in trying to brand the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as mentally unstable, the deposed Haitian leader has long been seen by Roman Catholic leaders as an advocate of political violence, a charge also leveled against him by the C.I.A. in Washington.</p>
        <p>The rift between the Vatican and Father Aristide dates to his 1988 expulsion from his order, the Salesians, and a church decision to bar him from publicly carrying out the duties of a priest.</p>
        <p>The reason, the Salesian order said at the time, was that his "exaltation of class struggle" conflicted with church doctrine. Like some other priests in the Caribbean and Latin America, he fell afoul of the Vatican's rigid opposition to so-called liberation theology, a blending of Christianity and Marxism. An Attack on a Nuncio</p>
        <p>He was also accused of using his faith to incite political violence. Those charges resurfaced shortly after Father Aristide's election as President in December 1990, when mobs burned down the Catholic Cathedral in Port-au-Prince and humiliated the Vatican's representative by stripping him to his underpants and beating his assistant.</p>
        <p>Vatican officials regarded the attacks as being orchestrated by Father Aristide to hit back at the church for his expulsion and suspension.</p>
        <p>The relationship has been further complicated since then by the Vatican's decision to recognize formally the soldiers who overthrew Father Aristide in September 1991. The Vatican sent a new papal envoy with the rank of ambassador to Haiti shortly after the coup. Still a Priest</p>
        <p>Despite the church's disciplinary measures against him, Father Aristide never received a formal dispensation from his vows, creating a further source of tension with the Vatican; by church doctrine, ordained priests are not supposed to hold political office.</p>
        <p>The complex of disputes has left the Vatican squirming as the standoff in Haiti has unfolded. While the church hierarchy clearly mistrusts Father Aristide, its doctrines leave it little choice but to support the democratic will of the Haitians who elected him. Accordingly, a Vatican spokesman said recently that there was "no political hostility" toward him.</p>
        <p>"It is not for the Vatican to pass judgment on the choice of the people," a Vatican official said, adding that it was "legitimate" for him to wish to return to Haiti. Cedras Suggests Mediation</p>
        <p>At the same time, a suggestion by the Haitian military leader, Gen. Raoul Cedras, of Vatican mediation in the dispute presents a further source of embarrassment, since it seems to imply that the general expects favorable treatment from Rome.</p>
        <p>A debate over whether to accept the invitation has swirled through the Vatican over the last week. The Pope met here last Wednesday with his official envoy to Haiti, Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri, but the Vatican gave no details about the meeting beyond restating that it had received no formal request for mediation. Father Aristide's followers have been quoted as condemning the idea.</p>
        <p>In a further twist, Vatican officials have expressed doubts about the current United Nations and Organization of American States embargo as a means of reinstating Father Aristide because, in the words of one official, "it only hurts those who have been hurt already."</p>
