        <p>Hell of a Ride  Backstage at the White House Follies, 1989-1993 By John Podhoretz 249 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $21.</p>
        <p>How did George W. Bush go from being one of the most popular Presidents in modern history in March 1991 to being voted out of office 18 months later? In "Hell of a Ride: Backstage at the White House Follies, 1989-1993," John Podhoretz, a professional speechwriter, has written a shrewdly plausible analysis with a wit (verging on occasional silliness) that makes you wish all political studies could be this lighthearted and succinct.</p>

        <p>Hell of a Ride  Backstage at the White House Follies, 1989-1993 By John Podhoretz 249 pages. Simon &amp; Schuster. $21.</p>
        <p>How did George W. Bush go from being one of the most popular Presidents in modern history in March 1991 to being voted out of office 18 months later? In "Hell of a Ride: Backstage at the White House Follies, 1989-1993," John Podhoretz, a professional speechwriter, has written a shrewdly plausible analysis with a wit (verging on occasional silliness) that makes you wish all political studies could be this lighthearted and succinct.</p>
        <p>Working his way up the White House chain of command like some particularly corrosive form of rust, Mr. Podhoretz performs a Parkinsonian dissection of bureaucratic inertia that probably applies to any failing enterprise on the globe.</p>
        <p>In his most outrageous chapter, "In and Out of the Loop, or, the Gnomish Gnostics Meet Skull and Bones," the author compares Richard Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and John Sununu, the White House chief of staff until late in 1991, to the early Christian Gnostics "who believed there was a hidden meaning to the words of Jesus only they could decipher by mystical knowledge with which only they had been endowed by God."</p>
        <p>Then Mr. Podhoretz refers to President Bush's version of his Yale secret society Skull and Bones as he writes, "In the end, the Gnostics and the Skull and Bones types (Bush, Brady and others) had a strange symbiotic relationship, like an alliance between the nerds and the jocks at some Ivy school." He continues: "The Skull and Bones boys went off and made the big plays in the big games in Panama and Iraq. The Gnomish Gnostics did the jocks' homework (domestic policy), and when even that wasn't enough, they went into the computer system and changed their C's to A's." But the relationship didn't work. "The Skull and Bones boys may have made a couple of big plays in Iraq, but they never won the game."</p>
        <p>Taking more serious aim at the Bush Presidency's failings, Mr. Podhoretz suggests that Mr. Bush suffered for what he describes as a betrayal of the Reagan revolution. Where Mr. Reagan was "the Teflon President," to whom no blame adhered because he always contended that the system was out of control, Mr. Bush became "the Velcro President," to whom everything stuck, "because he reveled in the fact that he was the king of Washington, the insider's insider."</p>
        <p>When the Reaganites were abandoned by Bush's followers, Mr. Podhoretz writes with a certain excess, "they came to hate Bush with the bottomless rage of a shy and awkward straight-A coed who, courted aggressively by a Big Man on Campus she does not trust, receives flowers and candy and love poems, and with some misgivings allows herself to be taken to bed; whereupon, the seduction complete, he rises quickly and is out the door to spread the word that she is easy, she is anybody's for the taking."</p>
        <p>Of course, all this is written from the perspective of someone with recognizable right-wing credentials. Mr. Podhoretz worked in the Reagan Administration and has worked at The American Spectator and The Washington Times. In an afterword, he thanks the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation for letting him write the present book and delay "the more scholarly project they had initially funded."</p>
        <p>All the same, his argument makes sense. In his next-to-last chapter, "The Solipsistic Presidency, or, Message: I Care," he argues that Mr. Bush's famously unstable syntax often arose from a conflict between his fixation on himself and his desire to avoid using the first person singular. ("But I will not underestimate the challenge ahead. And there's a seriousness that takes over right this minute.")</p>
        <p>Mr. Podhoretz concludes that while Mr. Bush may have won the Presidency "by wrapping Ronald Reagan around himself like a blanket," in the end he turned back into "a liberal Rockefeller Republican -- someone who basically believes everything a Democrat believes but thinks he can manage it better." In the end he became a Polonius: "He was in favor of good things and against bad things. As though good things were so easily come by; as though bad things were easily gotten rid of by merely stating your opposition."</p>
        <p>In "Hell of a Ride" -- from Mr. Bush's description of his Presidency -- Mr. Podhoretz is the very opposite of solipsistic. Sections called "Freeze Frames" alternate with the analytical chapters and offer what he calls "portraits of specific unnamed White House staffers," which simultaneously explain and mock Mr. Bush's followers. "Your real life is your work life," a typical passage reads. "In the White House, people seem to get married and have children for the sole purpose of having smiling faces that stare out at visitors from picture frames on desks -- or on walls, if their families have been fortunate enough to be snapped in proximity with the Bushes or the Quayles. A wife is to take to the staff Christmas party. Children are born to be borne to the South Lawn for the Easter egg roll."</p>
        <p>Elsewhere Mr. Podhoretz scrutinizes the problem faced by White House staff members who preferred not to clip their security passes onto their $750 suits and discusses the exhilaration that came over them at the Republican Convention in Houston when they found that with their cellular phones they could call people standing a mere 20 feet away.</p>
        <p>Whether you agree with Mr. Podhoretz's views, his book is worth reading, if only as a caustic for the five-pound doorstops that will inevitably be brought forth by more solemn commentators on the Bush Administration.</p>
