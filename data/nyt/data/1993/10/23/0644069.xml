        <p>The United Technologies Corporation said yesterday that its net income rose nearly 25 percent in the third quarter as a result of double-digit percentage increases at its Pratt &amp; Whitney jet engine, Otis elevator and Carrier air-conditioner units. But it said earnings of its auto parts operation fell almost 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Contributing to Pratt's operating profit of $60 million were lower costs and an increase in orders for highly profitable spare parts. Otis's operating profit increased to $100 million, from $78 million a year earlier, as a result of improvements in the European, Asian-Pacific and Latin American regions. Carrier posted an operating profit of $114 million, compared with $82 million, because gains in North America, Asia-Pacific and Latin America more than offset the effects of a recession in Europe.</p>
