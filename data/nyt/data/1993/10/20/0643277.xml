        <p>The head of the Prado Museum, Felipe Garin, resigned unexpectedly today after only 30 months at his post.</p>
        <p>The museum's board met quickly and nominated Francisco Calvo Serraller, a 45-year-old art history professor and renowned art critic, to succeed Mr. Garin. The nomination is expected to be confirmed by the Spanish Government in a Cabinet meeting on Friday.</p>

        <p>The head of the Prado Museum, Felipe Garin, resigned unexpectedly today after only 30 months at his post.</p>
        <p>The museum's board met quickly and nominated Francisco Calvo Serraller, a 45-year-old art history professor and renowned art critic, to succeed Mr. Garin. The nomination is expected to be confirmed by the Spanish Government in a Cabinet meeting on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garin's resignation, which was presented this morning to the new Culture Minister, Carmen Alborch, caught both the Prado's staff and Spain's art world by surprise. Ms. Alborch, with Mr. Garin at her side, cited fatigue as the reason for the resignation. Mr. Garin, 50, said he would not explain further now.</p>
        <p>Officials at the museum noted that Mr. Garin had been disappointed by a sharp cut in the Prado's 1994 budget, eliminating his disputed plan to build an extension to the 18th-century neo-classical building.</p>
        <p>The annex, largely underground, would include a reception area, new administrative offices, lecture halls and a cafeteria. Critics complained that it would provide little additional exhibition space, and many architects warned that the changes would fundamentally alter the profile of the building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Garin's resignation came barely a week after a leak in the roof of the museum created bad publicity for the Prado. For two days rain dripped onto the floor of the Velazquez room, which holds such masterpieces as "Las Meninas" and "Duke of Olivares."</p>
        <p>Although the leak has been repaired, the spectacle of wet blankets sopping up the water on the gallery floor caused a commotion and drew record crowds. Mr. Garin said the incident was not unusual for such an old building and suggested it was time to increase the museum's maintenance budget.</p>
