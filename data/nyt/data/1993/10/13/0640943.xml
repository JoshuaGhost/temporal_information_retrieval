        <p>SEA scallops are plentiful and sweet at this time of year, especially those from the chilly waters of the North Atlantic. And for the first time in nearly a decade, the harvest of bay scallops has been sizable off Long Island's East End and in other East Coast breeding grounds.</p>
        <p>A disastrous brown tide that first appeared in the mid-1980's all but wiped out bay scallops in the Northeast, and it has taken years for their seedbeds to regenerate. Bay scallops are still quite expensive owing to their relative scarcity, however, so the recipe here is designed to work well with either type.</p>

        <p>SEA scallops are plentiful and sweet at this time of year, especially those from the chilly waters of the North Atlantic. And for the first time in nearly a decade, the harvest of bay scallops has been sizable off Long Island's East End and in other East Coast breeding grounds.</p>
        <p>A disastrous brown tide that first appeared in the mid-1980's all but wiped out bay scallops in the Northeast, and it has taken years for their seedbeds to regenerate. Bay scallops are still quite expensive owing to their relative scarcity, however, so the recipe here is designed to work well with either type.</p>
        <p>I call this a Mediterranean-style dish because most of the ingredients are associated with that sunny seaside region of France: olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, capers, olives, lemon and thyme.</p>
        <p>In a recipe with so many diverse elements, it is important to adhere to the proportions, at least the first time. The ingredients are calibrated to complement one another and to yield one coherent flavor. Always taste the sauce for last-minute seasoning adjustments.</p>
        <p>The second time you make this dish, you may want to modify the flavors to suit your own taste.</p>
        <p>If all of the ingredients are at hand and ready to cook, this sauce can be made in less than 10 minutes. The scallops cook in about three minutes and must be served immediately.</p>
        <p>A fairly simple side dish is best with this full-flavored main course.  Penne or any tubular pasta with fresh basil leaves, olive oil and red pepper flakes is an ideal supporting act. The aromatic fresh basil echoes the Mediterranean theme, and hot pepper flakes give it an exhilarating boost. Mediterranean-Style Scallops</p>
        <p>1 large sweet red pepper  2 tablespoons olive oil  1 tablespoon chopped garlic  6 small ripe plum tomatoes, cored and cut into 1/2-inch cubes  6 large green olives, pitted and chopped coarsely  4 tablespoons drained capers  1teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves or 1/2 teaspoon dried  Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  2 tablespoons butter  1 1/2 pounds bay or sea scallops, cut in half crosswise if very large  Juice of 1 lemon  4 tablespoons coarsely chopped basil or parsley.</p>
        <p>1. Core and remove the seeds of the red pepper and cut into julienne strips about an inch long.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over high heat. Add the garlic and cook briefly; do not brown. Add the red pepper, tomatoes, olives, capers, thyme, and salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes. Then, remove from heat and keep warm.</p>
        <p>3. In a large nonstick skillet melt the butter over high heat. When the butter is bubbling, add the scallops. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes. Be careful not to overcook the scallops. Sprinkle the lemon juice and basil over them and cook and stir briefly.</p>
        <p>4. Spoon a portion of the tomato mixture onto each of 4 warmed serving plates. Distribute the scallops evenly over the mixture. Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>

        <p>Salt to taste  3/4 pound penne rigate or any large Italian tube pasta  1 tablespoon olive oil  Pinch freshly grated nutmeg  1 tablespoon butter  1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes or to taste  Freshly ground pepper to taste  4 tablespoons coarsely chopped basil leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Bring enough water for pasta to boil in a kettle or large saucepan. When it boils, add salt and the pasta. Bring to a boil again; cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes or according to package instructions. Do not overcook. Drain and reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking liquid.</p>
        <p>2. Transfer the pasta to the kettle. Then, add the drained liquid along with the olive oil, nutmeg, butter, pepper flakes and salt and pepper to taste. Toss well, and sprinkle with the fresh basil.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
