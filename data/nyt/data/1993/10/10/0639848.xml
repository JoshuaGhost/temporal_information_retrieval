        <p>THE Kmart Corporation's stock has been on a roll lately.</p>
        <p>Wall Street gave a big hurrah in August when the company announced that it was selling off Payless, its cut-price drugstore chain, which no longer meshes well with its other businesses. There were even louder cheers when word hit the street soon after that Kmart had hired investment bankers to sell pieces to the public of some of its other specialty-store chains, a move designed to set a market value for the stores that could help buoy the parent's stock. Kmart shares are up more than 20 percent since June, closing Friday at $24.25.</p>

        <p>THE Kmart Corporation's stock has been on a roll lately.</p>
        <p>Wall Street gave a big hurrah in August when the company announced that it was selling off Payless, its cut-price drugstore chain, which no longer meshes well with its other businesses. There were even louder cheers when word hit the street soon after that Kmart had hired investment bankers to sell pieces to the public of some of its other specialty-store chains, a move designed to set a market value for the stores that could help buoy the parent's stock. Kmart shares are up more than 20 percent since June, closing Friday at $24.25.</p>
        <p>But despite the euphoria, some analysts are sounding a warning note: Kmart's main business -- its 2,400 general discount stores -- remains quite sick. Focusing on the immediate returns from restructuring the corporate balance sheet misses the point, they say. "As a shareholder, it leaves you holding an investment that's even more dependent on the discount stores," said Brent W. Clum, an analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Excluding Payless, the discount stores accounted for 92 percent of Kmart's operating profits of roughly $1.8 billion last year, and more than 70 percent of its $35.4 billion in sales, said David Poneman, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Company in New York. And because of the problems in its Pace Warehouse Clubs, Kmart will be even more reliant on the discount stores this year, analysts say. Kmart, based in Troy, Mich., and the country's second-largest retailer after Wal-Mart, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clum and others say the investor excitement over Kmart masks how difficult it may be to fix the discount operation, which has been losing ground to more nimble competitors like Wal-Mart and Target for the last 10 years. Three years ago, Kmart embarked on an ambitious program to renovate its stores and increase the fashion appeal of its apparel, but has had mixed results.</p>
        <p>To be sure, sales have started picking up over the last couple of months after stalling since last Christmas. And last week's appointment of Joseph R. Thomas to lead the discount stores in the United States underscored a commitment to do better. Mr. Thomas, a veteran Kmart executive, is known for his trouble-shooting abilities.</p>
        <p>Still, the competition between Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target, which is owned by the Dayton Hudson Corporation, is getting tougher and tougher.</p>
        <p>That hurts all three, but it hurts Kmart the most because it wields the tools of the trade -- including inventory management and cost controls -- less effectively than the others.</p>
