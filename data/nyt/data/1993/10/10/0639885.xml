        <p>An agreement between Hasidic Jews and Hispanic residents to rehabilitate an apartment building to be shared by the two groups may be in jeopardy after 200 squatters took over a new housing project last weekend, saying they feared most apartments would go to Hasidim.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Southside Housing Development Fund Corporation, or Los Sures, and the United Jewish Organization of Williamsburg began discussing the joint housing venture a year ago after tempers flared over a Hasidic proposal to seek Federal money to convert two housing projects into cooperative projects.</p>
        <p>But because a Los Sures worker, Cathy Herman, joined the protest, the deal may be in danger.</p>
        <p>Administrator David Pagan of Los Sures and City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher spoke early last week with Rabbi David Niederman, director of the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg. Both said he expressed dismay about Ms. Herman's participation in the protest. Mr. Fisher said the rabbi felt the two groups might not be able to continue the project.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Niederman was unavailable for comment last week because of his observance of Jewish holidays.</p>
        <p>"He was upset," Mr. Pagan said on Friday. "But as far as I'm concerned we're moving ahead in the joint venture. The only thing left is the selection of a general contractor."</p>
        <p>But Councilman Fisher said his conversation with Rabbi Neiderman sounded firm.</p>
        <p>The group's plan calls for the redevelopment next spring of a six-story, red-brick building with 21 apartments at 907 Driggs Avenue in the heart of the Hasidic community.</p>
        <p>On Oct. 1, the squatters, organized by groups including the Southside Fair Housing Committee (not affiliated with Mr. Pagan's organization), took over the 150-unit complex at South 10th and Berry Streets. They left the next day after city officials promised them the right to monitor the selection of tenants.</p>
        <p>The takeover illuminated the longstanding friction between Hispanic and Hasidic residents over housing and services in Williamsburg.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the discord is growth. Between 1980 and 1990, the Hispanic population in Community Board 1, which encompasses Williamsburg, has grown by 14 percent. The Hasidic population grew at about the same rate. The area of Board 1 has a population of 155,972 residents, 46 percent non-Hispanic white and 44 percent Hispanic.</p>
        <p>Williamsburg, with its tenements, factories, warehouses and industrial buildings, is a place where a street named Division Avenue functions as a dividing line between residents. Hasidic residents live mostly on the north side of the avenue while Hispanic residents live on its south side, bordering the predominantly black Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.</p>
        <p>"The community is growing so fast that there is no more land and very few vacant buildings that can be rehabilitated," Mr. Pagan said. "We're finding that we need to share." LYNETTE HOLLOWAY  WILLIAMSBURG</p>
