        <p>THE ROAD TO SAN GIOVANNI By Italo Calvino. Translated by Tim Parks. 150 pp. New York: Pantheon Books. $19.</p>
        <p>ALTHOUGH most of Italo Calvino's fiction avoids psychological realism for speculative fantasy, he was undoubtedly obsessed with the changing contours of human identity. His preferred technique was to trace a personality with the precise detail of a realist, when in fact he was not presenting a "character" but an idea, a scientific concept, cultural theory or social diagnosis. This makes his speculations wryly amusing, puckish, even occasionally affecting, but his readers are also left with the disquieting sense that the self is no more than a construction sutured together from diverse languages and literatures, varying with historical periods and cultural contexts. The special pleasure of "The Road to San Giovanni," a collection of five autobiographical essays, is that we see Calvino taking the same sort of approach with his own identity. The results are highly revealing.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the first revelation is that Calvino, whose books have sometimes been criticized as too coolly detached and impersonal, saw a close connection between his life and his writing. As a brief preface to this volume by his widow, Esther, indicates, at his death in 1985 at the age of 61 Calvino was planning a series of "memory exercises" to be entitled "Necessary Steps," an account of his formation as a writer. The essays he did complete sketch a chronology from his boyhood in San Remo during the 1930's through his experience fighting in the Italian Resistance during World War II to his long residence in Paris during the 1960's and 70's.</p>
        <p>The Calvino that emerges here is extremely self-conscious, offering finely observed evocations of the Italian landscape or a Parisian suburb, but also a running metacommentary on the act of writing a biography. In "Memories of a Battle" a skirmish between the partisans and the Italian Fascists is made suspenseful not so much by the exchange of gunfire as by Calvino's struggle to recall the incident. Memories of sounds turn out to be more vivid than his fragmentary visual images -- he recalls shots, explosions, voices, the song that suddenly identifies the winning side -- but he can't forestall the ultimate doubt: "I don't know if I am destroying the past or saving it."</p>
        <p>What Calvino locates in his past is the origin of the interests he would later cultivate in his writing. "A Cinema-Goer's Autobiography" tells of his adolescent obsession with Hollywood movies, which he admits was escapist, an "evasion" of family duties, but which "satisfied" his own penchant for fantasy, "a need for distance, for an expansion of the boundaries of the real." He makes incisive comments on the movies and actors he most admires, American, French and Italian, including a very personal appreciation of Federico Fellini's autobiographical cinema. Yet the essay also assumes one of Calvino's favorite themes, the idea that human consciousness is shaped by cultural forms like movies and books, by what is other than itself, a "disorientation" that precedes "any character formation."</p>
        <p>In the case of Calvino's sense of himself as an author, the other was what challenged his father, an agronomist who hoped that his son would take over the family estate. The title essay presents this challenge partly as a clash between different concepts of language: "To my father's mind, words must serve as confirmations of things, and as signs of possession; to mine they were foretastes of things barely glimpsed, not possessed, presumed." Authorship depends on the son's competition with the father, which is social and economic (a rejection of the provincial life of a landowner), but also literary and sexual: Calvino wittily parodies the agronomist's Linnaean classifications ("Ypotoglaxia jasminifolia," "Photophila wolfoides") and recalls shirking farm work and going to the beach, where "the girls toss balls with their smooth arms."</p>
        <p>The essays are well served by the translator, the British novelist Tim Parks, who manages to develop an English style that itself embodies Calvino's thoughts on language. The prose is eminently readable, cast in standard usage for the most part, yet dotted with Britishisms: "a big block of flats," "trams," "bedclothes," "aubergine" (for "eggplant"), among many others. These work to striking effect in "La Poubelle Agreee" (literally, "The Agreeable Trash Can"), where Calvino brilliantly unpacks the significance of taking out the trash in Paris, reflecting on the division of labor by sex and race as well as the multicultural sensibility that develops in metropolitan centers. Mr. Parks's use of very British expressions like "dustbin men" and "cutlery" (where an American might use "garbage men" and "silverware") neatly bears out Calvino's recurrent point in this volume: "Every word we think oscillates in a mental field where different languages intrude."</p>
        <p>"The Road to San Giovanni" is a welcome addition to the English translations of Calvino's writing, and a provocative reminder of how truly international that writing is.  Lawrence Venuti's latest book is a translation of I. U. Tarchetti's "Fantastic Tales."</p>
