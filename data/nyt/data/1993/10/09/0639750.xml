        <p>President Clinton's decision to send more troops to Somalia, even while setting a deadline for a final United States pullout, did not satisfy Tony Bright.</p>

        <p>President Clinton's decision to send more troops to Somalia, even while setting a deadline for a final United States pullout, did not satisfy Tony Bright.</p>
        <p>"It just won't work," he said.</p>
        <p>Like many Americans -- a majority, according to polls -- Mr. Bright, an emergency health care administrator, has doubts about American involvement in Somalia and President Clinton's handling of the situation.</p>
        <p>He favored speedy withdrawal before the President spoke late Thursday afternoon. And, like millions of other Americans, he still does. 'Bring the Boys Home'</p>
        <p>"It's really very simple," Mr. Bright said on Thursday. "If I have to choose between pictures of starving Somalian babies or dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu, well, I don't want to see any more dead Americans. Sorry. It's time to bring the boys home."</p>
        <p>This morning he added, "What the President proposed doesn't change a thing for me."</p>
        <p>Formal and informal surveys of Americans after the President spoke indicate that he changed few minds. The demands for withdrawal are still loud and adamant, though some people who earlier wanted an immediate pullout are now willing to give the President time to recover American bodies and prisoners.</p>
        <p>"From here on, we shouldn't do any more than get back our dead and our prisoners and get out safely," said Carl Kamp, a retired Federal banking official from Atlanta. "If that takes a few more troops and a few more weeks, then O.K. But absolutely no escalation and don't drag it out. I don't like this."</p>
        <p>An ABC News poll taken shortly after the President spoke on Thursday found a majority of Americans -- 52 percent -- did not approve of Mr. Clinton's handling of the situation. On Tuesday, an ABC News poll found 53 percent did not approve. Both polls had a margin of sampling error of five percentage points.</p>
        <p>The recent fighting in Somalia, which left 15 American soldiers dead and more than 85 wounded, has crystallized American public opinion on an issue that previously was not particularly pressing to the average citizen. And the pictures of a dead American soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu seem to have made it all but impossible for Mr. Clinton to change many minds. 'Get Out of There'</p>
        <p>"That absolutely turned me off," said Carin Steckler, a Seattle secretary. "We should get out of there."</p>
        <p>Penny Thompson, a food service supervisor in Lexington, Ky., also was repelled by the pictures.</p>
        <p>"We don't need this grief," she said. "I say turn the whole thing back over to the U.N. and let somebody else take the heat. We gave it our best and it just didn't work. If they don't care any more over there, than we don't care any more over here."</p>
        <p>Polls taken after the fighting in Somalia escalated but before the President spoke found that two of every three people surveyed favored American withdrawal, and about half of the respondents favored withdrawal even at the risk of leaving Somalia in more turmoil and even if another famine resulted. Interviews with about 100 Americans around the country indicate the President has done little to change those numbers and opinions.</p>
        <p>In Houston, Rick Coe, a park ranger, said that the United States, for all its good intentions, should pull out of Somalia because it had turned into "a nightmare, a quagmire, a death trap."</p>
        <p>"It's a no-win situation," he added. "That's indicative to get out."</p>
        <p>In New York City, Claudia Berns, a travel consultant, reached a similar conclusion.</p>
        <p>"Originally we were there to restore order and feed people," she said. "At this point, we should get out. The people there haven't backed us." 'Hard to Back Out'</p>
        <p>Another New Yorker, Calvin Harrison 3d, a security supervisor, said he not only opposed Mr. Clinton's proposal to stay in Somalia a while longer but had opposed intervention in Somalia back during the Bush Administration.</p>
        <p>"I don't think we should have been there in the first place," he said. "I don't think the troops are doing anything. We should get out. Our soldiers are dying."</p>
        <p>Here and there around the country, the interviews did find some support and understanding for President Clinton's position.</p>
        <p>"It's kind of hard to back out when they're dragging Americans down the street," said Barbara Bolt, a concession stand operator in Houston. "We've got to go in there and get them, then just pull everybody back out."</p>
        <p>Kevin Dyes, a customer service representative for a telephone company in Cincinnati, said: "If it takes more force, we'll have to do it. Because if we pull out, it's going to cost lives."</p>
        <p>In Kansas City, Mo., Dave Brown, a computer engineer, said he supported the President because the job in Somalia is not finished.</p>
        <p>"If it takes more troops, we need to send them," he said. "We've got to take on these ideas or nobody else will."</p>
        <p>Still, for the most part the interviews turned up negative reaction to Mr. Clinton's speech and proposals.</p>
        <p>In particular, the interviews uncovered deep concern that the nature of the United States mission in Somalia was becoming more military oriented than humanitarian. Few respondents saw Somalia posing a significant military threat to the United States, especially in the post-cold-war era.</p>
        <p>"We started out giving food and now we're shooting bullets and getting shot at in a little country that really doesn't amount to much," said Ed Steelman, a carpenter from Bethel, Ohio. "That's flat crazy. And now the President is talking about getting in deeper? Hard to believe."</p>
        <p>Somewhat surprisingly, given the national agony caused by the American retreat from Vietnam, there seems to be no overbearing concern in the nation that a retreat from Somalia would make the United States appear weak, defeated and indecisive.</p>
        <p>President Clinton warned that a hasty retreat would reflect badly on the nation and its standing in the world. But many Americans nevertheless tend to see a pullout almost as a sign of strength and confidence and, not least of all, proof that the United States is gaining a more sophisticated and mature view of what its role should be in the international arena. 'We Keep Blundering'</p>
        <p>"There are common-sense limits to our moral responsibilities to the rest of the world," said Gene Pinder, the public relations manager at the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga. "We've had the good common sense to stay out of the Bosnia quagmire so far and nobody's calling us the world's coward. We're the world's only superpower now. Life is no longer us versus the Russians. We can cut it off and leave Somalia because Somalia no longer makes good sense."</p>
        <p>But while most Americans tend not to draw a close parallel between a retreat from Somalia and the traumatic flight from Vietnam, the American experience with "nation building" in Vietnam has nevertheless left many people wary that a similar experience -- and failure -- in nation-building could occur in Somalia.</p>
        <p>"Somalia is not a sophisticated Western society," said Pat Finley, a retired paper company executive from Atlanta. "We keep blundering into these kinds of places because of our natural American generosity. But sooner or later we're going to have to face up to the cold fact that this is another of those countries where we can't impose democracy at an acceptable cost, if at all. They're not ready for it, can't handle it yet."</p>
        <p>So what should the United States do?</p>
        <p>"Get out," Mr. Finley replied. "We should never have gone there in the first place."</p>
        <p>The widespread American aversion to involvement in Somalia does not appear to be grounded in a new isolationism. Rather, it seems to result from a feeling that the nation should temper its do-good tendencies with a solid measure of international practicality.</p>
        <p>"Situations like Somalia are going to come up again and again and we're going to have to learn to deal with them better," said Dick Bryant, a commercial photographer from Chattanooga. "We need to develop a policy that says, 'Don't get involved if it's not doable.' We have to be very tough on ourselves when we do this."</p>
        <p>And what of Somalia, using this approach?</p>
        <p>"Not doable," Mr. Bryant replied.</p>
