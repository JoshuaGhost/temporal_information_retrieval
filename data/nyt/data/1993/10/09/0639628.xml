        <p>In January 1991, Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute in her late 20's, admitted to the murders of seven men, each picked up on a Florida highway, which was her usual venue. Some months later, after pleading no contest to the murders, Ms. Wuornos was sentenced to six life sentences, though she had been tried for only one of the murders.</p>
        <p>The press and especially the television tabloid shows had a field day with the story about what they called "the man-hating murderer," apparently because Ms. Wuornos was an admitted lesbian. It was Tyria Moore, her lover, who tricked Ms. Wuornos into a confession during a telephone call monitored by the police. One immediate result of all this public interest: "Overkill," the television feature in which Jean Smart played Ms. Wuornos.</p>

        <p>In January 1991, Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute in her late 20's, admitted to the murders of seven men, each picked up on a Florida highway, which was her usual venue. Some months later, after pleading no contest to the murders, Ms. Wuornos was sentenced to six life sentences, though she had been tried for only one of the murders.</p>
        <p>The press and especially the television tabloid shows had a field day with the story about what they called "the man-hating murderer," apparently because Ms. Wuornos was an admitted lesbian. It was Tyria Moore, her lover, who tricked Ms. Wuornos into a confession during a telephone call monitored by the police. One immediate result of all this public interest: "Overkill," the television feature in which Jean Smart played Ms. Wuornos.</p>
        <p>Now Nick Broomfield, an English film maker, has made a fine documentary feature that examines not only the Wuornos story but also the entire phenomenon surrounding it. "Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer" doesn't have the personal swagger of Michael Moore's "Roger and Me," but it is that film's equal in all other ways.</p>
        <p>It is sometimes funny, but far more often very sad and appalling. It's a slice of Americana to make you cringe with embarrassment as you recognize the society it reveals. In its way of suggesting that justice has not been adequately done, it also recalls Errol Morris's "Thin Blue Line."</p>
        <p>"The Selling of a Serial Killer" will be shown at the New York Film Festival tomorrow at 9:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>The film's two most breathtaking real-life characters: Steve Glazer, the bearded, fast-talking, guitar-playing lawyer who took over the Wuornos defense from a public defender, and Arlene Pralle, a born-again Christian who read about the case in the newspapers and felt a call to help Ms. Wuornos. After a busy correspondence and many prison visits, Ms. Pralle, who is married and raises Tennessee walking horses, legally adopted Ms. Wuornos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Glazer is not only a lawyer but also a card. When asked what he would say to his client facing the electric chair, he recalls the lawyer's advice to Virgil Starkwell in Woody Allen's "Take the Money and Run": "Don't sit down." In the course of all the hoopla surrounding the case, he also became the agent for Ms. Moore in her dealings with the press, television and film people. Together they demand $25,000 to cooperate with Mr. Broomfield, but settle for $10,000.</p>
        <p>Revealed in the course of the film is the fact that Mr. Glazer and Ms. Pralle advised the prisoner to enter her no-contest plea, which made death sentences almost certain. Says Ms. Moore: "The state has a death sentence so, golly, in a few years she could be with Jesus. Why not go for it?"</p>
        <p>There are also charges that members of a county sheriff's office and Ms. Moore were dealing with film producers about rights to their stories even before Ms. Wuornos confessed. In addition, it appears to be Mr. Broomfield's point that relevant evidence was not presented in her behalf during the trial.</p>
        <p>The agonized center of the movie are television clips of the prisoner's trial testimony and, toward the end, an interview with Ms. Wuornos in which she questions the motives of her lawyer and adoptive mother. Though there's no thought that she is innocent, her testimony suggests persuasive mitigating circumstances. Mr. Broomfield and others he interviewed also wonder why there was no investigation of Ms. Moore's possible complicity in the crimes.</p>
        <p>"The Selling of a Serial Killer" examines a very large can of worms. Not a pretty sight, but a significant one. We live in an age when to be associated with a crime, an accident or an act of God, as long as it's sufficiently bizarre, may be as profitable as winning a lottery. AILEEN WUORNOS  THE SELLING OF A SERIAL KILLER  Directed by Nick Broomfield; photography by Barry Ackroyd; music by David Bergeaud; produced by Mr. Bloomfield and Rieta Oord; released by . At Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, as part of the 31st New York Film Festival. Running time: 87 minutes. This film has no rating.</p>
