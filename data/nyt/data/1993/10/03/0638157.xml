        <p>Every year for at least the rest of the decade, more than two million Americans, most of them solidly middle class, are likely to lose their jobs because of fundamental changes in the world economy.</p>
        <p>It is one of the most vexing social and political problems facing President Clinton, and its immediate symbol has become the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
        <p>Unless Mr. Clinton can persuade lawmakers this fall that he is coming to grips with the question of lost jobs, Congress will reject Nafta, as the accord is known. From the President's perspective, the trade measure will be the most crucial issue Congress will vote on this year.</p>
        <p>"Many Democrats are waiting to see what the Administration does on jobs," said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, who is coordinating the campaign in the House on behalf of the trade agreement. "It will have a big impact on how members vote on Nafta." Support Is Slender</p>
        <p>So far, only about one-quarter of the Democrats in the House have promised to vote for the trade measure, far too few for it to pass.</p>
        <p>Administration officials insist that the agreement will actually lead to a net increase in employment in the United States and cause relatively few jobs to be lost. But they concede that as a political matter, the trade accord and the President's response to the jobs problem are inextricable. Right or wrong, many workers fear that free trade would result in the moving of their plants and jobs to Mexico, where wages are lower.</p>
        <p>In the minds of many Americans and the politicians who represent them, the agreement, which would gradually lift trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada, has come to represent the economic transformation that makes the future seem bleak to many middle-class factory workers.</p>
        <p>Politicians cannot vote against competition from Europe and Japan, against American plants moving overseas in search of cheaper labor, against companies at home cutting their work force or against the lower military budgets that are costing so many industrial jobs. But they can vote against Nafta.</p>
        <p>The President's effort on the jobs issue is important for other political reasons as well. His election last year resulted to a large extent from his winning the votes of blue-collar workers who had voted Republican in the 1980's, and he cannot afford to lose them. And he will be hard pressed to win re-election if he cannot carry swing states like California, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where the problem of dwindling factory jobs is most severe. Failure of Retraining</p>
        <p>The jobs situation is especially daunting because the solutions tend to be very expensive and because the Government's efforts over the years to find unemployed workers jobs in fields different from the ones they left have rarely succeeded.</p>
        <p>"The problem you run into," said Calvin Johnson, a lobbyist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., "is what to do with a 40-year-old auto worker who's used to making $45,000 or $50,000 a year. No one has ever figured out how do we retrain the middle class."</p>
        <p>Anthony P. Carnivale, the chief economist of the American Society for Training and Development, said studies over the years had showed that roughly 60 percent of workers who are laid off find new jobs within a year. Generally, he said, their wages are lower at first -- by 10 percent on average for service workers, 20 percent for manufacturing workers and 30 percent for automobile and steel workers. But within five years, these workers are usually earning what they were in their old jobs.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Carnivale said, perhaps 35 percent of the workers who lose their jobs never again make the same wages.</p>
        <p>Louis Jacobson, an economist at Westat, a consulting company in Rockville, Md., took a different cut at the figures. Based on the records of thousands of people who were laid off in Pennsylvania in the 1980's, he and his colleagues calculated that the average cost of a job loss for a worker with at least six years on the job was $80,000 over the rest of the worker's life.</p>
        <p>Few people know these statistics better than Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and his Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training, Douglas Ross. Mr. Reich, who taught at Harvard University, spent his academic career writing about economic changes and their effects on workers. Mr. Ross was director of the Department of Commerce in Michigan for five years in the 1980's when that state's economy was on the ropes.</p>
        <p>In the Clinton Administration, employment policy has been almost completely delegated to the Labor Department, unlike other big domestic initiatives like health care, welfare and education, in which officials in the White House have taken charge. Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to the President, said the jobs policy was being handled differently because of Mr. Clinton's high regard for Mr. Reich, who has been a friend for more than 25 years.</p>
        <p>In separate interviews, Mr. Reich and Mr. Ross said that Government programs now on the books had been intended to correct for short-term unemployment resulting from a general economic downturn and that times were different now.</p>
        <p>Three of four workers who lost their jobs last year did not go back to the same type of job, the highest proportion since the statistic was first recorded in 1967, Mr. Ross said. And he noted that people today were unemployed longer. In the 1970's, 11 percent of those laid off were still unemployed after six months. In the 1980's, that figure had risen to 15 percent, and last year, it was up to 21 percent.</p>
        <p>What the Administration plans, he said, is an ambitious program that would identify permanently displaced workers early, give them counseling, help match them with available jobs and, in some cases, place them in community colleges or other forms of long-term education and training.</p>
        <p>Studies have shown that job training for a few weeks or months generally does no lasting good, while programs for 18 months or longer often lead to new credentials, skills and solid jobs.</p>
        <p>The most innovative element of the proposal, scheduled to be announced late this month, involves stipends to workers to cover living expenses while they attend school or undertake training.</p>
        <p>These programs would be available to all workers regardless of why they lost their jobs and would take years before they were fully in effect. Mr. Reich argued that it would be a mistake to have a special program to help workers who lost their jobs because of the trade agreement. He said time and money would be wasted while a bureaucratic determination was made about why particular jobs had been lost, and he said it would be unfair to offer different programs to people who worked at the same company but made slightly different products.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Reich said he recognized that a special jobs program related to the trade pact might be a political necessity, and he said the Administration was considering such a program "as a bridge to" a comprehensive jobs retraining program. 'Trying to Find Money'</p>
        <p>The comprehensive program would eventually cost $3 billion a year, Mr. Ross said -- $2 billion for job services and training and $1 billion for the stipends -- and the Administration has not determined how to finance it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reich said, "I am scurrying around trying to find money."</p>
        <p>Critics say the Administration's proposals, even at a cost of $3 billion a year, would not come close to fulfilling those aims. Mr. Jacobson, the economist at Westat, said that reasonable compensation to workers who lose jobs because of Government policies could cost as much as $20 billion a year.</p>
        <p>Another official engaged in preparing the Administration's jobs proposal said that no Government program could realistically protect factory workers from the economic changes sweeping the world.</p>
        <p>Somehow, he said, the Government needed to persuade workers to take their future into their own hands and begin preparing for economic change long before it occurred.</p>
        <p>He compared workers who lose assembly line jobs because their plants close to those who for years disregard warnings about smoking and cholesterol and eventually have heart attacks. "You can't wait till you have an economic coronary," he said.</p>
        <p>That is not the kind of message politicians like to give their constituents.</p>
