        <p>As a lawyer, I applaud the proposal that lawyers should be required to participate in a "Legalaid" program by which they would provide legal care for the needy at reduced rates paid by the Government ("Health Reform? How About Lawyers," Viewpoints, Sept. 26).</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a lawyer, I applaud the proposal that lawyers should be required to participate in a "Legalaid" program by which they would provide legal care for the needy at reduced rates paid by the Government ("Health Reform? How About Lawyers," Viewpoints, Sept. 26).</p>
        <p>All attorneys qualified to appear before the Federal District Court sitting in Chicago and Rockford, Ill., are required to accept appointments by the court, entirely uncompensated.</p>
        <p>Why do lawyers accept this involuntary servitude? I think lawyers recognize that while legal restrictions on the practice of law protect the public, they also restrain competition from non-lawyers; the (perhaps not entirely unintended) consequence of a licensed profession is the increased profit of the professionals. Because the state maintains the profession and enforces the restraints on practice, I believe lawyers know in their hearts that the Government can use them in a small way for the public good.</p>
        <p>As for the proposal for "Legalaid," it will find few powerful political allies outside the legal community. Providing poor people with a lawyer allows them to sue and win cases against people with money and political influence. GREGORY J. BUECHE  Wheaton, Ill., Sept. 27</p>
