        <p>To the Editor: A double helping of appreciation for Alice Furlaud's "France's Three-Star Cats" (Aug. 22), which charmed and entertained us in its own right, but also reminded us of our own unexpected encounter with another feline hotel staff member.</p>
        <p>Although we've come almost to assume a cat will attend us at most American bed and breakfasts, we've never found one in residence at the more formal hotels in this country. Perhaps because such an expectation never entered our minds, we were surprised and delighted to find the marmalade cat Gainsborough seeing to her morning toilette while comfortably ensconced upon a brocaded sofa in the drawing room of the Dower House at the Royal Crescent in Bath, England.</p>

        <p>Although we've come almost to assume a cat will attend us at most American bed and breakfasts, we've never found one in residence at the more formal hotels in this country. Perhaps because such an expectation never entered our minds, we were surprised and delighted to find the marmalade cat Gainsborough seeing to her morning toilette while comfortably ensconced upon a brocaded sofa in the drawing room of the Dower House at the Royal Crescent in Bath, England.</p>
        <p>Unlike her Continental counterparts, Gainsborough knows her place, which is not the dining room. Picking her way with dainty grace along an invisible dividing line, she glanced nonchalantly at the breakfast crowd on her way to the drawing room sofa, or across the garden. After tea one day we found her asleep on her favorite sofa, a whisker's length from some leftover tea cakes. ANNE F. MILLER  New Albany, Ind.</p>
