        <p>IT could be your next-door neighbor describing her fear for the safety of her teen-agers when they leave the house on weekend nights -- but it isn't. It's Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey, looking squarely into the camera as she tries to convince voters that she is not soft on crime, as Gov. Jim Florio would have them believe.</p>
        <p>"As Governor," she says in a new campaign ad, "nobody will be tougher than me on drunk drivers and criminals, especially those who prey on women and children."</p>

        <p>IT could be your next-door neighbor describing her fear for the safety of her teen-agers when they leave the house on weekend nights -- but it isn't. It's Christine Todd Whitman, the Republican candidate for Governor of New Jersey, looking squarely into the camera as she tries to convince voters that she is not soft on crime, as Gov. Jim Florio would have them believe.</p>
        <p>"As Governor," she says in a new campaign ad, "nobody will be tougher than me on drunk drivers and criminals, especially those who prey on women and children."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Whitman did not have to emphasize her point with the usual campaign-season props of bloodied bodies and blaring sirens. People are already afraid.</p>
        <p>Crime, always a potent political issue, has taken on a chilling new character for many Americans. In the public imagination, hard-core criminals can no longer be expected to simply rob and kill; they now seem to carry out their deeds with unparalleled wantonness, even exultation, and the criminal-justice system, when not directly part of the problem, hardly seems up to the challenge.</p>
        <p>Many recent episodes are feeding the fear: There was the Mayor of Washington, D.C., Sharon Pratt Kelly, on Friday asking President Clinton for authority to call out the National Guard to combat the city's soaring homicide rate. There was the Reginald Denny beating case, which ended in Los Angeles last week with convictions of his assailants, but not on the most serious charges against them -- despite what to many people was damning videotaped evidence of brutality against the truck driver followed by a jig of glee. (Details of the verdict, page 2.) There was the police beating of Rodney King before that, and the initial acquittals of the officers that touched off the Los Angeles riots in the first place. There were the highway killings of foreign tourists in Florida, and the torching there of a black tourist from New York (bringing life sentences for his assailants last week). There was the roadside murder of the father of the basketball star Michael Jordan. Carjackings. The list goes on and on.</p>
        <p>Like Mayor Kelly, politicians around the nation, many with an eye to Election Day a week from Tuesday, are responding to the perception that violent crime has sped out of control and that the criminal-justice system in many cases has broken down (witness the recent hearings on police corruption in New York City).</p>
        <p>Last week Attorney General Janet Reno pointedly placed a large share of blame on television, warning industry executives that if they didn't tone down televised violence, the Government would compel them to.</p>
        <p>In gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and in mayoral races in New York, Detroit, Miami and other cities, the heightened debate over crime has brought to the fore not so much new remedies but age-old tensions between Republicans and Democrats: Do you lock up more offenders? Hand out stiffer sentences? Or should the priority be getting guns off the streets? Gun Control Gains Favor</p>
        <p>As the New Jersey race illustrates, the Democrats have the potential to make the issue their own as the National Rifle Association loses clout and as voters favor measures like the ban pushed through by Mr. Florio on certain semiautomatic weapons. Paradoxically, Republicans used to point to Democrats' support for gun control as evidence that they were soft on law and order. A test for Democrats in Congress is whether, after years of failed efforts, they can pass a strong anti-crime package this year.</p>
        <p>Inescapably, the debate over crime has been complicated by the issue of race. The revulsion over the Los Angeles riots helped the election of Mayor Richard Riordan, a self-described law-and-order politician and the first Republican to hold that office in a generation. In the mayoral race in New York, there are tensions over whether the tough-on-crime stance of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican challenging Mayor David N. Dinkins, is a subtle appeal to prejudice.</p>
        <p>"We've seen a difference in the nature of crime -- a bravado where you've got juveniles who have no fears," said Charles M. Oberly, the Attorney General of Delaware who is running as a Democrat for Senate next year. "It's an expedient political issue: What else do you tell people when you can't get them jobs and you've got an economy that's stagnant? So there's fear-mongering going on, and the public is ripe for it."</p>
        <p>While the nation's overall crime rate dropped slightly in 1992 -- the first time it had not increased in eight years -- the most violent crimes, especially rape and aggravated assault, continued to rise, according to the F.B.I.'s Uniform Crime Report.</p>
        <p>In politics, in any case, it is perceptions that count. So as people buy up burglar alarms in record numbers, they say in surveys that they feel less safe, even in their own homes, than ever before. In a poll conducted last April by L. H. Research for the Harvard School of Public Health, 94 percent of Americans said crime had gotten worse in comparison with the time they were growing up.</p>
        <p>Mark Melman, a Democratic pollster, said crime is the No. 1 issue for mayoral candidates he is advising this year in Seattle and New Orleans, but not because crime is on the rise. "The real crime rate and peoples' perceptions are two different things," he said.</p>
        <p>Already, Democrats are upbeat about their fortunes. Recalling that Mr. Clinton got a standing ovation when he mentioned the crime issue at a dinner for Senate Democrats, Don Foley, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign, said: "That's something I didn't expect to see from a Democratic audience in my lifetime." As the Democrats grow more comfortable with the issue, Republicans seem increasingly uneasy. Just as they moderated their opposition to abortion four years ago, many are changing tack on gun control now. Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, a Republican, reversed himself last month and proposed some of the most stringent gun control laws in the country.</p>
        <p>Yet many Republicans are still torn over how best to shore up their reputation for toughness on crime. Haley Barbour, the Republican Party chairman, echoed the Democrats' dire concerns about crime, but made clear that a call for gun control was not part of his pitch.</p>
        <p>"In some parts of Washington, D.C., people say they are afraid to go out of their houses," he said, dismissing the city's gun control law. "And they know that the only way that you're going to do something about that is to have sure and severe punishment to violent criminals."</p>
        <p>Stuart A. Scheingold, a professor at the University of Washington who specializes in crime and politics, has little patience for candidates who are talking up crime. "This is all symbolic," he said. "But everybody's avoiding the really tough issues of addressing the fundamental social conditions that are breeding this."</p>
        <p>As an example, the much-promoted Clinton crime bill, which would extend the death penalty to 50 crimes, has been criticized as a rehash of a proposal by President Bush.</p>
        <p>For now, many politicians are doing little more about crime than making commercials. In a spot strikingly similar to Mrs. Whitman's, Mayor Norm Rice of Seattle, a Democrat, strolls through a residential neighborhood, assuring voters: "I hear you. These are our streets. And we must take them back."</p>
