        <p>Volunteer lawyers in New York City provide counsel in housing court, handle basic legal matters for persons with AIDS, represent children in Family Court and represent victims of abuse and discrimination seeking protection. They help nonprofit organizations with corporate, tax and real estate issues and work on low-income housing and economic development transactions. In all, New York City's lawyers donated about $100 million in legal services to the poor last year -- none of it tax-deductible. That's pretty impressive. ALLEN R. BROMBERGER New York, Oct. 4 The writer, an attorney, is executive director of Lawyers Alliance for New York, a pro bono program for lawyers in New York City.</p>
