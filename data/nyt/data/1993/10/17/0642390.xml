        <p>THE ARABISTS The Romance of an American Elite. By Robert D. Kaplan. Illustrated. 333 pp. New York:  The Free Press. $24.95.</p>
        <p>ON his way home from Iraq in June 1983, an American engineer named Robert Spurling was separated from his wife and three daughters at Saddam International Airport and thrown in jail. Accused of spying for Israel, he was tortured for three months. Electrodes were attached to his genitals and his fingernails were pulled out. The charges were trumped up; eventually, Mr. Spurling was set free. The man who ordered the torture, President Saddam Hussein's half brother Barzan Ibrahim al-Takriti, later became Iraq's human rights delegate in Geneva.</p>
        <p>At the time, the State Department did not publicize the atrocity. The Arabists who have long dominated the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs were eager to believe that Saddam Hussein was a man who could be worked with. He was, after all, the enemy of America's enemy, Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini. His nation was, for all its brutality, the best hope for "secular modernism" in the Middle East. So when Saddam Hussein gassed several thousand Kurds in 1988, American diplomats argued that the incident had to be put in "perspective." It was just such institutional myopia that led the United States Ambassador to Iraq, April Glaspie, to foolishly flatter Saddam Hussein a few days before he invaded Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
        <p>The performance of the State Department Arabists was a "disgrace," Robert Kaplan writes in "The Arabists." Mr. Kaplan can be withering about these modern-day pashas, smug and insulated in their air-conditioned cocoons. But this well-traveled journalist, the author of books on Ethiopia, Afghanistan and the Balkans, is also empathetic toward the Arabists, even toward the unfortunate Ms. Glaspie. In a book that does much to illuminate American policy toward the Middle East, he pushes beyond the stereotype of the anti-Semite-gone-native to tell a fascinating story about some who were bright-eyed adventurers and who, while often blinded by the sun, were intensely patriotic and sometimes brave.</p>
        <p>"Arabist," Mr. Kaplan points out, has been a loaded word, at least ever since the United States recognized Israel in 1948. It became "a pejorative for he who intellectually sleeps with Arabs," said a former Assistant Secretary of State for the Middle East, Richard Murphy. The modern Arabist is the progeny of colorful forebears, the upright Wasp missionaries who completely failed to convert the adherents of Islam in the 19th century, and "sand-mad" Britons, like T. E. Lawrence, who were entranced by the nihilism and purity of the desert.</p>
        <p>American Arabists after World War II liked to believe they were pragmatists who were willing to ask uncomfortable questions, like "So, how many oil wells does Israel have?" They were naturally accused of anti-Semitism, and it is true that their leader, Loy W. Henderson, the head of the State Department's Division of Near Eastern Affairs in the late 1940's, did not hide his contempt for leftist Jewish intellectuals. Henderson tried hard to strangle Israel in the crib. In the spring of 1948, while Israel was besieged by five Arab armies, Henderson and his State Department colleagues were working to prevent any arms from reaching the newborn state. But the Arabists were not so much anti-Semitic as insensitive, Mr. Kaplan writes. The Holocaust was to them an abstraction, while the plight of the Palestinians was real. The Arabists were also profoundly elitist, scornful of President Harry S. Truman for caving in to the Jewish lobby. These diplomats "knew better" than mere politicians.</p>
        <p>But they didn't. The Arabists wrongly believed that it was necessary to choose between Israel and the Arab world. Experience has proved that the wisest policy is to coexist with both. And they could be famously wrong, as they were about Saddam Hussein's intentions toward Kuwait. But they also scored some real victories, not all of them well known.</p>
        <p>One was Operation Moses, the rescue of thousands of starving Falashas from Ethiopia in 1984. The Israelis have portrayed the dramatic airlift of Ethiopian Jews to the Promised Land as another coup for the dashing men of Mossad. In fact, as Mr. Kaplan shows, it was largely the work of a pair of American diplomats. One of them was the United States Ambassador to the Sudan, Hume Horan, who described his post as "the place where the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse stable their steeds." Mr. Kaplan vividly describes Mr. Horan as "a man so cerebral that, exactly like T. E. Lawrence, the size of his head seems out of proportion to the rest of his body. His eyes flicker about and drink light, focusing on some blank sheet of inner peace, the kind a physicist might look at. It is as though Horan is disembodied: a distilled brain in a jar."</p>
        <p>Mr. Horan's State Department comrade in rescuing the Jews was the exact opposite: a former football lineman for Ohio University named Jerry Weaver, who, in this account, was a whoring, gun-toting wild man, albeit a very resourceful one. Most of his close friends were Sudanese; he quickly became fluent in their Arabic dialect; his favorite pastime was hunting wild animals with them; and he habitually dressed in jungle khaki rather than Embassy staff pin stripes. With Mr. Horan's encouragement, Mr. Weaver schemed and bribed and sweated to save the Ethiopian Jews from starvation. It is fitting, Mr. Kaplan writes with his sense of balance and irony, that the American who did the most to save Jews in recent years was an Arabist who had gone completely native. UNDERSTANDING THE SAUDIS</p>
        <p>There seemed to be no individual . . . better qualified at that moment to be Ambassador to Saudi Arabia than Hume Horan. . . . But the last thing King Fahd and his cronies wanted was a hands-on type of American in Riyadh, one who knew Arabic. . . . In late 1987 Horan was just settling into his new job when he and his embassy . . . began to solve the latest riddle of the sands. Why, for instance, was the Chinese food disappearing so fast from local markets? . . . Because Chinese technicians were eating it. They were in the desert south of Riyadh, installing medium-range ballistic missiles, Silkworms. . . . The Saudis had given a secret promise to Washington not to deploy such weapons, but . . . Prince Bandar, the Saudi Ambassador in Washington, had reportedly closed the deal on the Silkworms himself during visits to China. . . . The State Department in March 1988 instructed Horan to make it clear to King Fahd just how distressed the United States was by the deployment of the missiles. . . . Horan put the protest in writing and personally delivered it. . . . Within hours of delivering the letter, Horan received a cable from Washington telling him . . . "a different communication" had gone out direct from Washington to Riyadh. Bandar reportedly "backchanneled" through his White House contacts to get Horan's orders rescinded after they had been carried out. . . . Washington recalled Horan. . . . A feeling persisted within the Foreign Service community that Horan was done in not just by the Saudis . . . but also by senior bureaucrats . . . for understanding the Saudis better than they wanted to be understood.
