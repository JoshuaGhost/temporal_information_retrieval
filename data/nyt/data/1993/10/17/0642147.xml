        <p>CALL it the stealth merger. On Wall Street, where word of unannounced deals used to leak faster than a morning diaper, some news is suddenly, well, news.</p>
        <p>Almost as noteworthy as the announcement Wednesday morning that Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc. would be engaging in the nation's biggest-ever merger was the fact that the parties to the transaction had managed to keep it quiet.</p>
        <p>That's not to say the entire financial gang has suddenly gone straight. Monkey business may have gone on in options trading of Tele-Communications in the days before the deal, for example. And the convoluted developments in the fight to buy Paramount Communications were regularly making their way into the gossip mill -- and stock prices -- before official word was put out.</p>
        <p>But, looking at the big picture, the insider trading quotient seems to have declined. Up until now, anyway.</p>
        <p>"We have had a fair drop in the number of incidents which we have forwarded to the Securities and Exchange Commission," said Edward Kwalwasser, executive vice president for regulation at the New York Stock Exchange. "And what cases we do see tend to be cheaters within corporations, not at law firms and investment banks."</p>
        <p>That Bell Atlantic and TCI managed to keep their plans from finding their way into the financial markets is apart from the companies' efforts to carefully leak the news to several newspapers the night before -- a public relations move that helped squeeze a little extra ink out of the splashy deal. But even the calls to reporters came after the New York financial markets had closed.</p>
        <p>Stock prices of both companies moved about in line with those of others in their industries in the weeks before the announcement -- though some options were looking a little fishy in Monday trading.</p>
        <p>Rest assured that nobody on Wall Street has donned a halo. Rather, the players who sport the horns and pitchforks have thinned their ranks, having been shipped off to minimum-security spots like Lompoc, Calif.</p>
        <p>Further reducing the gossip factor is that a number of the arbitragers betting on deal stocks in the 1980's are out of business. "A lot of the fringe players are no longer there," said John Wilcox, of Georgeson &amp; Company, a proxy solicitation firm.</p>
        <p>Equally important is that mergers, 1993-style, have tended to be friendly -- and negotiated among corporate executives, not loquacious lawyers and investment bankers. "With friendly deals there is tighter security," said George Kellner of Kellner DiLeo, an arbitrage firm. "They don't have to go around to every commercial and investment bank trying to peddle the deal."</p>
        <p>Indeed, the standout leak-prone deal has been that of the fight to purchase Paramount, where lawyers, bankers and public relations firms are highly involved in devising strategy -- which includes deftly leaking to the press where deemed advantageous. Big friendly deals this year, including Columbia Healthcare's purchase of HCA and A.T.&amp;T.'s buyout of McCaw Cellular, appear not to have affected either stock or options prices of those companies before official announcements, said Bernard Schaeffer, editor of The Option Advisor.</p>
        <p>Those who might want to cheat have less incentive to use their inside information because this era's mergers are largely done for stock, not cash, Mr. Wilcox explained. "Cash has an immediate, definable impact on the market," he said. "But exchanges of stock are much less clear because the value of the securities offered may fluctuate."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kwalwasser said cheaters also run greater risks of being caught. It's become easier to get trading information from other countries, he said, so use of trading accounts outside the United States is not as advantageous as it was in the 1980's. And it makes sense that at least some deterrent effect must have resulted from the scandals of the 1980's that led to incarceration for some offenders.</p>
        <p>Thus, the Big Board has referred just 30 suspicious cases to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1993, Mr. Kwalwasser said. This time last year, 50 such cases had been referred to the stock cops.</p>
        <p>Before too much is made of an honest streak among those holding inside information, it should be said that the cheaters will no doubt increase in number to the extent that friendly deals turn hostile. And, even among friendly deals, evidence is already apparent of pre-announcement action. Mr. Schaeffer spotted fishy put-options activity in Tele-Communications on Monday; it appears one player may have sold 7,000 contracts at $62.50 to $75 apiece only to buy them back Wednesday at $31 apiece -- a possible $280,000 profit for two days work.</p>
        <p>Nice work if you can get it. Stay tuned for more such shenanigans as dealmaking picks up steam.</p>
