        <p>DONALD TRUMP, testifying this month at a congressional hearing on how Indian casinos are policed and regulated, touched a raw nerve when he complained that certain American Indians, who he said, "don't look like Indians to me," enjoyed unfair advantages in the gambling business by virtue of the Federal laws governing tribal autonomy.</p>
        <p>The remarks by the Atlantic City titan, whether racially tinged or simply blunt, revisited issues that Indians and non-Indians alike say have been simmering for years and are now attracting more attention, both in Washington and in tribal circles. What are the limits of tribal rights, and how does a tribe get them?</p>
        <p>And are there cultural or racial factors involved in gaining tribal recognition? Are Navajos who speaks their own language and live an ancient culture more authentic in the eyes of the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs than the recently recognized Catawbas, most of whom have some white ancestry, who live in a South Carolina suburb, or the mostly black Paugussetts who grew up in Bridgeport, Conn.? And, nowadays, how do casinos, which are emerging as a major revitalizing force in many impoverished Indian communities, change the dynamics and the import of the recognition process?</p>
        <p>Legal experts say procedures for securing tribal recognition have long been either capriciously political or highly bureaucratic. However, gambling money and new tactics in pursuing tribal rights have increased pressure on state and Federal governments as well as on intertribal relations.</p>
        <p>Already enmeshed in controversy is the tribal application of the Golden Hill Paugussetts, who have filed state and Federal lawsuits to reclaim property in the Bridgeport area that they say was stolen over the last 300 years. The Connecticut General Assembly plans to hold a special session on such land claims this week. The Ramapough Mountain Indians of New Jersey, which has no Federally recognized tribes, are also seeking official status. Both groups have indicated that casino development would soon follow recognition.</p>
        <p>"Something's going to break," said Representative Robert G. Torricelli, a Democrat from Hackensack, N.J., who opposes a Ramapough casino and has introduced a bill that would limit tribal rights by giving state governments, which now have only limited authority in the matter, full veto power. Mr. Torricelli said he does not object to recognition, but he opposes giving the Indian group a commercial advantage. He said he also fears that organized crime could infiltrate Indian operations. "Indian casinos are largely unregulated and almost completely untaxed," he said.</p>
        <p>The Government's recognition of tribes has an import similar to the recognition of a new foreign nation: the United States acknowledges an Indian nation as a sovereign entity, and can negotiate treaties with it, be they treaties of commerce or conflict. A tribe can then use some Federal laws to its own benefit, and effectively ignore some state laws.</p>
        <p>In Connecticut, for example, the Mashantucket Pequots, the state's only federally recognized tribe, opened a casino last year in Ledyard using a law allowing charities and nonprofit groups to hold bingo nights. Elsewhere, tribal businesses thrive by not charging state sales tax on items like cigarettes or gasoline.</p>
        <p>Advocates for more tribal recognition criticize the rules for being stacked against those tribes in New England and the upper Midwest whose first contact or treaty with a European power predates the founding of this country. These treaties, unlike later documents ratified by the Senate, are not considered instant legal proof of sovereignty. Tribes in the South, where many land and municipal records were destroyed during the Civil War, have similarly suffered disadvantages in proving their ancestry. Continuity of Traditions</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the B.I.A., Holly Reckord, said the agency decides recognition based on proof of continued cultural existence. In one case, she said, a tribe showed how its cultural continuity had been maintained through the Congregational Church. Another tribe maintained its traditions through the mechanisms of their tiny town's government.</p>
        <p>But for any tribe unlucky enough, through geography or history, to have missed the great treaty signing era of the 1800's when many tribes gain legal status, the difficulties are enormous. Since 1978, when procedures were formalized, eight tribes have been recognized by the B.I.A., according to another B.I.A. spokesman, Carl Shaw, and 13 have been denied.</p>
        <p>Of the 515 federally recognized tribes in this country, many located along the paths of the pioneer trails west, most have also been able to base their claims on old treaties.</p>
        <p>"This is the 1990's -- people travel, they're better educated -- we don't have to go to the powwow to be Indian anymore," said Patricia Marks, a Washington attorney who represents several tribes petitioning for recognition.</p>
        <p>Some tribes, figuring they have a better chance if they do an end run around the B.I.A., one of Washington's most criticized bureaucracies, are seeking direct recognition by an act of Congress -- a trend that established Indian tribes denounce.</p>
        <p>"The whole question of sovereignty is so sacred," said George Waters, a Washington lobbyist who represents many older established, and what he calls "conservative" Western tribes. "We want assurances that there are going to be uniform criteria adhered to strictly."</p>
        <p>Those Indian conservatives have found an ally in people like Representative Christopher Shays, a Republican from Fairfield County, Conn., who believes that gambling interests, by financially backing tribes in their application or lobbying efforts, are compromising the entire system through which Indian rights are considered and exercised.</p>
        <p>"I find it frightening, no other word," Mr. Shays said. "The potential these gaming interests have in hiring well placed lobbyists, and well placed law firms -- we've really got the tiger by the tail."</p>
