        <p>The pining has begun at NBC and TNT for the loss of Michael Jordan. Viewers will still watch National Basketball Association games. They will still have Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal to astound them.</p>
        <p>But NBC and TNT relied on Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to swell their ratings, scheduling as many Bulls games as their N.B.A. contracts would allow. Both have signed new four-year television deals with the N.B.A. that will begin after this season.

        <p>The pining has begun at NBC and TNT for the loss of Michael Jordan. Viewers will still watch National Basketball Association games. They will still have Charles Barkley, Larry Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal to astound them.</p>
        <p>But NBC and TNT relied on Jordan and the Chicago Bulls to swell their ratings, scheduling as many Bulls games as their N.B.A. contracts would allow. Both have signed new four-year television deals with the N.B.A. that will begin after this season. Those deals require them to pay 25 percent more, partly because of the league's success during the nine-year Jordan era. NBC will pay $750 million and TNT $350 million.</p>
        <p>Not only was Jordan routinely spectacular, but he performed in the nation's third-largest television market, whose viewers watch nationally televised broadcasts of their teams in greater percentages than fans in other cities. An NBC Star</p>
        <p>NBC's four top-rated games last season starred Jordan and the Bulls, topped by a Christmas prime time meeting against the Knicks. The finals between the Bulls and the Phoenix Suns was the highest-rated in league history, eclipsing the 1987 series between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics.</p>
        <p>NBC's 1993-94 schedule starts Christmas night with the Bulls playing the Orlando Magic, followed by six more Bulls games, including two against the Knicks.</p>
        <p>"Michael Jordan leaving is like Seinfeld leaving NBC," said Bob Costas, who is the host of "N.B.A. Showtime," the network's pre-game studio show. "He's a prime time show to himself. His impact is hard to calculate. Jordan brought in fans who weren't necessarily hard-core fans, but who were just hooked on Jordan and the Bulls."</p>
        <p>Over eight seasons on TNT, and before that, on TBS, the long-running Jordan show has provided the cable networks with ratings 17 percent higher than the average game produced. TNT has scheduled the maximum of 10 Bulls games this season, starting with the Nov. 5 opener against the Charlotte Hornets. N.B.A. Star Quality</p>
        <p>"Losses like Jordan's and Magic Johnson's get your attention, and you wonder what the effect will be," said Kevin O'Malley, the senior vice president of Turner Sports, the parent of TNT and TBS. "But over the course of our 50 regular-season games and 35 playoff games, there's enough star quality in the N.B.A. to weather the departure of any individual."</p>
        <p>Jordan's retirement is a professional loss for Marv Albert, NBC's top N.B.A. commentator. "He provided more drama in terms of play-by-play than any other player," Albert said. "His style was perfect for the dramatic moment of the game in terms of the play-by-play call."</p>
        <p>Costas and Albert both expect Jordan's retirement to last a year. "A week ago, I heard he was talking about retirement and no one was taking it seriously," Albert said. "He's so young. I think it'll be a year and he'll come back to play in the new arena."</p>
        <p>Dick Ebersol, the president of NBC Sports, said: "We lost Magic, and surmounted that, then we lost Larry, and now we've lost Michael. Losing the greatest player ever to play the game has to have some effect. We can't really measure it until the end of the season when the casual fan goes in and out of games."</p>
        <p>He said he will inquire about Jordan's desire to be an analyst for NBC, but wondered whether that type of job would be a return to the limelight that he wants to leave.</p>
