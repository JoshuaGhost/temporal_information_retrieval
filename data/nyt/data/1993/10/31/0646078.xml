        <p>As the city sees it, the new, less expensive Harlem-to-Wall Street express bus along Fifth Avenue is an enhancement of existing express services, and people should be happy.</p>
        <p>But Yorkville residents are complaining: they fear the new private service will threaten two public East Side lines to Wall Street. Their concern is that the Transit Authority will close the York Avenue route to lower Manhattan for lack of passengers, forcing residents to walk to Fifth Avenue for the other bus.</p>

        <p>As the city sees it, the new, less expensive Harlem-to-Wall Street express bus along Fifth Avenue is an enhancement of existing express services, and people should be happy.</p>
        <p>But Yorkville residents are complaining: they fear the new private service will threaten two public East Side lines to Wall Street. Their concern is that the Transit Authority will close the York Avenue route to lower Manhattan for lack of passengers, forcing residents to walk to Fifth Avenue for the other bus.</p>
        <p>The big difference between the services is fare: $4 on city lines and $2 on the new line, which is operated by Liberty Lines Express of Yonkers, one of seven city-subsidized operators. That service, which began on Oct. 18, starts in the Bronx and follows existing bus routes, but for the first time it can now pick up passengers in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The first Manhattan stop is 125th Street and Fifth Avenue. The red and white buses -- BxM4A, BxM4B and BxM3, both southbound and northbound -- then go to 26th Street, with a free transfer to the BxM18 to Wall Street during rush hour. The Manhattan leg takes about 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>The two city express services are the x90, from 110th Street and Fifth Avenue to the World Trade Center, and the x92, from 92d Street and York Avenue to Broad and Water Streets. Both buses take about 35 minutes.</p>
        <p>Betty Cooper-Wallerstein, president of the 79th Street Neighborhood Association, has denounced the "inequity" of the fares. "Why should people who live east of Lexington Avenue pay twice as much as people who live west of the avenue to get to Wall Street?" she said.</p>
        <p>Arline Bronzaft, a former consultant to the Transit Authority, said: "If the D.O.T. really wanted to help the Upper East Side it should lower the fare of the existing Wall Street express buses rather than put in a new private line that competes with city buses and the subway."</p>
        <p>City Councilman Andrew Eristoff also expressed concern "over a subsidized bus in competition with our public transit system."</p>
        <p>But Charles Seaton, a Transit Authority spokesman, said no changes are planned for the city's Wall Street service. MARVINE HOWE</p>
