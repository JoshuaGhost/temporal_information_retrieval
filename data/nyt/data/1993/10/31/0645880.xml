        <p>The new wrinkle in fashion is one that is permanently pressed into the shirt, vest, blouse, jacket or pants ensemble. The wrinkled look is part of a pleating explosion the designer Issey Miyake set off five years ago, opening up a whole new world of surface textures and decoration.</p>
        <p>Many men are wearing Mr. Miyake's abstractly wrinkled polyester shirts, which are often hidden under traditional jackets -- a subtle way of embracing a new style. Occasionally, one can see a wool jacket, also permanently wrinkled. Other men are wearing the designer's crinkly pleated polyester vest in stained-glass colors.</p>

Occasionally, one can see a wool jacket, also permanently wrinkled. Other men are wearing the designer's crinkly pleated polyester vest in stained-glass colors.</p>
        <p>Women are wearing crinkly shirts in a pullover style that has a high collar and long cuffs that spill out beyond jacket cuffs. These shirts give a woman's suit a contemporary embellishment that relies on fabric, rather than traditional decorations.</p>
        <p>The way has been paved for a new generation of designers to focus on fabric innovations, instead of exaggerated changes in clothes themselves.</p>
