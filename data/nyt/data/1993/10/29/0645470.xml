        <p>"Driven to Create: The Anthony Petullo Collection of Self-Taught and Outsider Art" at the Museum of American Folk Art is a lively show that has some problems, beginning with the terms in its title.</p>
        <p>Outsider art -- not so long ago called naive art -- is enjoying a high profile these days. But who exactly qualifies as an outsider? The insane, the visionary, the aged, the merely quirky, any artist living and working at a reasonable distance from the mainstream art world? And what about self-taught? Does it simply refer to the unschooled, to anyone who rejects esthetic conventions, or to anyone who tries to invent a visual vocabulary from scratch? To judge by this exhibition, all of the above.</p>

        <p>"Driven to Create: The Anthony Petullo Collection of Self-Taught and Outsider Art" at the Museum of American Folk Art is a lively show that has some problems, beginning with the terms in its title.</p>
        <p>Outsider art -- not so long ago called naive art -- is enjoying a high profile these days. But who exactly qualifies as an outsider? The insane, the visionary, the aged, the merely quirky, any artist living and working at a reasonable distance from the mainstream art world? And what about self-taught? Does it simply refer to the unschooled, to anyone who rejects esthetic conventions, or to anyone who tries to invent a visual vocabulary from scratch? To judge by this exhibition, all of the above.</p>
        <p>But if "Driven to Create" does nothing to help clarify confusing blanket definitions, at least it doesn't use them to obscure the distinctions among artists themselves. The show, drawn from the collection of the Milwaukee businessman Anthony Petullo, manages both to encompass a wide range of sensibilities -- European and American, painterly and draftsmanly, decorative and expressive -- and to keep individual achievements very much to the fore.</p>
        <p>Some artists, like the Swiss Adolph Wolfli (1864-1930), are well known. Wolfli was institutionalized for violent behavior, and his colored pencil drawings on paper, meticulously shaded, have an explosive, locked-in intensity. A different sort of violence marks the work of the American Henry Darger (1892-1973), who wrote and illustrated a 15,000-page chronicle about children threatened by evil creatures called Glandelians. His crowded, delicately tinted, scroll-like watercolor of men strangling little girls is, characteristically, part "A Child's Garden of Verses" and part pedophilic fantasy.</p>
        <p>Visually even more packed is the work of Madge Gill (1882-1961), a British housewife and spiritualist who died an alcoholic. The minute checkerboard patterns in her ink drawings are here and there parted like curtains to reveal the images of stairways leading to tiny altars. Her obsessive all-over approach finds an echo in the manic, sexualized drawings of the 45-year-old Johann Garber, currently a patient at the famed Gugging psychiatric hospital near Vienna.</p>
        <p>Interestingly -- and this is where the show begins to raise questions -- one finds identical stylistic traits in the work of artists whose lives suggest that they are not outsiders at all. While the expressionist figures of Rosemarie Kosczy and Michel Nedjar, and the cityscapes of the 31-year-old Bangladeshi painter Shafique Uddin, share characteristics of the work of psychologically disturbed and isolated artists, these three painters are neither insane nor visionary, and two of them (Ms. Koczy and Mr. Uddin) have had academic training.</p>
        <p>The presence of the delightful British painter Sylvia Levine (born in 1911) is similarly confusing. Her heavily worked seaside landscapes and wispy nudes are securely within a modernist vein and have been shown at London's Royal Academy. Yet the artist in the show whom she most closely resembles is the Irish painter James Dixon, who lived and died on a remote North Sea island, and began making art only in his 70's. His "West End Village, Tory Island" depicts his village as a curve of land tumbling diagonally into a snow-flecked sea.</p>
        <p>In fact, it is in just such startlingly original images as Dixon's -- and Ms. Levine's -- that the value of "Driven to Create" lies. The struggle over categories begins to lose its urgency in the presence of images like Joseph E. Yoakum's fanciful mountain ranges, with their debt to Chinese painting, or the witty animal figures of Bill Traylor and William Hawkins, or a large tempera drawing by Carlo Zinelli that is a blizzard of pulled teeth and nonsense syllables, or the self-portrait by Max Raffler, with the grinning bespectacled artist in a cozy domestic paradise surrounded by two cats and a pot of flowers.</p>
        <p>The show's installation is a bit clunky: 100 works, even small ones, are just too many for the museum's oddly shaped space (a James Dixon ends up marooned at the bottom of an emergency exit stairway). But the catalogue is good, with an alert essay by Russell Bowman addressing the label wars that rage in the field. "Driven to Create" adds yet more fuel to that fire, but in the process it also offers some wonderful artists: outsider, self-taught or whatever they may be.</p>
        <p>"Driven to Create: The Anthony Petullo Collection of Self-Taught and Outsider Art," which was organized by the Milwaukee Art Museum, remains at the Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square (Columbus Avenue at 65th Street), through Nov. 7. It then travels to the Milwaukee Museum (March 11 to May 8, 1994); the Krannert Art Museum, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, (Sept. 10 to Nov. 6, 1994); the Akron (Ohio) Art Museum (April 8 to June 4, 1995), and the Tampa (Fla.) Art Museum (June 25 to Aug. 27, 1995).</p>
