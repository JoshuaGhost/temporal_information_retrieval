        <p>All Around the Town</p>
        <p>There's something about the rhythms of New York City that grabs a writer's imagination. Its streets and subways and parks provide wacky but rich settings for comedies, dramas and suspense, fiction and nonfiction alike.</p>
        <p>But writing about New York City itself can be a daunting task.</p>
        <p>Yale University Press now knows that as few publishers do. In the fall, Yale will publish "The Encyclopedia of New York City," edited by Kenneth T. Jackson, chairman of the history department at Columbia University. The 1,372-page book, which includes more than 4,000 entries by 650 contributors as well as 680 illustrations and maps, took 13 years to pull together. It has cost more than $1 million to produce, with only about $130,000 going to the writers.</p>
        <p>"This is the project of a lifetime," said Fred Kameny, the reference editor at Yale. "And at one point I feared it might become the project of an entire lifetime. But now it's done."</p>
        <p>The book, which will have an initial printing of 25,000 copies, costs $60. Like the city itself, the book did not have space for everything, but it does have numerous entries on architecture, government, business, religion, weather, the arts, science and sports.  And it covers the five boroughs from pre-history to the present.</p>
        <p>In addition to many sober facts, there are also some entertaining trivia. For example, the company later known as the American Chicle Company got its first chicle from Gen. Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the president of Mexico in the mid-1800's, who at the time was living in exile in Staten Island. Slow and Steady . . .</p>
        <p>Best-seller lists usually focus on sprinter books, or those that sell quickly over a short period of time. But the really hefty sales often come from less glamorous titles that may not be fast out of the gate, but that sell and sell and sell.</p>
        <p>Such is the case with the "Star Trek" books that Simon &amp; Schuster has been publishing since 1979. Every minute, the publisher says, 13 "Star Trek" books are sold. All told, there are now 130 separate titles and 65 million "Star Trek" books in print.</p>
        <p>So it was no surprise yesterday when the publisher's interactive division announced the shipment of 300,000 copies of its newest "Trek" title, "Star Trek Omnipedia," the largest initial order for a CD-Rom product by a traditional book publisher. While many CD-Rom titles, like books, sell 20,000 or so copies, the "Star Trek" CD-Rom from last year, "Star Trek: The Next Generation Interactive Technical Manual," has sold 290,000 copies.</p>
        <p>The "Omnipedia," which can be operated with specific voice commands, is a collection of fact, lore, trivia and "Star Trek" history that includes 2,000 photographs as well as dozens of movie bits and animations. The CD-Rom, which will be sold for $55 to $60, goes on sale beginning Aug. 15.  Lasting Influences</p>
        <p>If publishers worry that they are losing their next generation of readers to video games and computers, a new book, "Dear Author," to be published next month by Conari Press in California, may dispel some concerns.</p>
        <p>The book, a collection of 75 letters from junior high and high school students, is a result of a two-year contest in which students across the country were asked to write about books that changed their lives.</p>
        <p>"Dear Carl Lewis," wrote Kathleen Niblett from San Luis Obispo, Calif. "Well, I'm in school now and back on track. Last year I dropped out. Thanks to your book, 'Inside Track,' I was given the inspiration to, as you put it, 'look forward.'</p>
        <p>"Sports has always been my life. It was the only thread I had to hang on to. I don't have a team or a coach, only my little brother, Michael.</p>
        <p>"We play in the same way you did by setting up track meets in our yard."</p>
        <p>Andrea Urbiel, a student from Detroit, wrote to Shel Silverstein:</p>
        <p>"We've been everywhere with you. We've built the treehouse, the free house, the secret-you-and-me house. We did the home-made boat. We've been acrobats. We've had gashes and rashes and purple bumps.</p>
        <p>"I find more wisdom and more life in a poem written on the neck of a running giraffe than in many of my long-winded textbooks. So, Mr. Shel Silverstein, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"</p>
        <p>And to Maya Angelou, Sherry Cox, a student in Puerto Rico, wrote, "I would like nothing more than to walk with you to that old water well and have a cup of cold water . . . and talk about family, togetherness and trust, and about our future as a nation."</p>
        <p>"Thank you for sharing your life with us," she concluded. "And I really do understand why a caged bird sings." More Princely Peccadilloes</p>
        <p>The Prince of Wales is none too happy about yet another book that pries into his personal life.</p>
        <p>In a letter dated July 28, lawyers for Prince Charles warned Barricade Books that Wendy Berry, the housekeeper-turned-author who worked for him from 1985 to 1992, was breaking royal rules with her book, "The Housekeeper's Diary," which is being shipped to stores this week. In the 186-page volume, Mrs. Berry describes the disintegration of the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana as well as prurient details about other members of the family.</p>
        <p>"The disclosure of such information anywhere in the world by Mrs. Berry is in breach of an undertaking of confidence given by her in her contract of employment," the letter said.</p>
        <p>Lyle Stuart, Barricade's publisher, said he would not withdraw the book.</p>
        <p>"The Housekeeper's Diary" has been banned in Britain, where servants of the Royal Family have always been sworn to secrecy about the lives of their employers. Rights to the book have been sold in Germany, Japan and Italy. End Notes</p>
        <p>*Pramoedya Ananta Toer, the Indonesian novelist who has been under town arrest in Jakarta since 1979, has been awarded the 1995 Ramon Magsaysay Award for Journalism, Literature and Creative Communication Arts, which carries a prize of $50,000. Mr. Toer's fourth novel in the "Buru" Tetralogy, "House Of Glass" (William Morrow) will be published next spring.</p>
        <p>*Little Brown has bought world English-language rights to the actor Ethan Hawke's first novel, "The Hottest State," the story of a 21-year-old in Manhattan who falls in love and is left heartbroken. The book, which has autobiographical overtones, sold for about $300,000. It will be published in the fall of 1996.</p>
        <p>*Avon Books, a division of the Heart Corporation, is starting a new adult hard-cover line of commercial fiction and nonfiction books next fall. In corporate moves, Michael Greenstein has been named Avon's new president, and Lou Aronica will be Avon's senior vice president and publisher.</p>
        <p>*Clare Ferraro has been named publisher of the Ballantine Publishing Group, a division of Random House, and Leona Nevler has been appointed Ballantine's senior vice president and editorial director.</p>
