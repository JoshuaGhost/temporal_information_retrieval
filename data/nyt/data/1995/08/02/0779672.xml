        <p>Conceding that his officers should not have shut down the Long Island Expressway for seven hours on Monday morning to investigate a crash, the Suffolk County Police Commissioner today ordered a review of how his department handles accident and crime scenes on the expressway.</p>
        <p>"I have to agree with our critics on this one," said the Commissioner, Peter F. Cosgrove. "While it does take time to process a crime scene, it shouldn't take seven hours. There should have been a way to open at least one lane to traffic. That has to be a priority."</p>

        <p>Conceding that his officers should not have shut down the Long Island Expressway for seven hours on Monday morning to investigate a crash, the Suffolk County Police Commissioner today ordered a review of how his department handles accident and crime scenes on the expressway.</p>
        <p>"I have to agree with our critics on this one," said the Commissioner, Peter F. Cosgrove. "While it does take time to process a crime scene, it shouldn't take seven hours. There should have been a way to open at least one lane to traffic. That has to be a priority."</p>
        <p>On Monday, county officials had defended the lengthy closing. The police said they were forced to close all westbound lanes around 1:20 A.M. on Monday after a van being driven by a fleeing burglary suspect struck a police car, forcing both vehicles to spin off the road and crash into a ditch near Exit 51 in Commack. Both the officer and the suspect suffered serious injuries and remained in critical condition today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cosgrove, who spent late Monday visiting with the officer, Sgt. Timothy Henck, at the State University Hospital at Stony Brook, said the officer had suffered several broken ribs and severe head injuries.</p>
        <p>The Commissioner noted that his department had also been criticized for closing the expressway near Exit 49 in Huntington for five hours during the morning rush last Thursday while investigators took measurements after a two-car accident.</p>
        <p>"I like to defend my department when we're right, but lately we've ended up with egg on our face," said Mr. Cosgrove, who called a meeting of his top officers at Police Headquarters here this morning, he said, "to review and revamp procedures for closing the expressway."</p>
        <p>Carol Spence, a product-quality analyst for the Federal Government who travels the Long Island Expressway daily visiting Government contractors throughout the Island, said she had had to cancel three appointments because of recent tie-ups on the expressway.</p>
        <p>"It was a nightmare on Monday," she said. "If it all happened around 1 o'clock in the morning -- what took them so long?"</p>
        <p>Jill Conway, who lives in Commack, said her commuting, usually 15 minutes, to her job as news assignment editor at WLIG-TV in Melville took nearly an hour on Monday. "I ended up on back roads to avoid the L.I.E., but they were just as slow and crowded," she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cosgrove said part of the problem last Thursday was the use of new laser measuring equipment with which investigators were not yet familiar. "One can expect a little time for learning, but it should not have taken that long," he said.</p>
        <p>"And on Monday," he said, "we should have gotten at least one lane open. Both damaged vehicles were off the road and in a ditch, and the center lanes were available. In a situation like that, we should clear one lane, open it to traffic and work back toward the accident or crime scene."</p>
        <p>In neighboring Nassau County, Inspector Kenneth McGoff, the commanding officer of the Police Department's Highway Patrol Bureau, said that keeping the traffic moving on the expressway was one of his department's top priorities.</p>
        <p>"It's a critical arterial link on which everyone on Long Island depends for everything from their toothbrush on down," he said.</p>
        <p>Since the expressway is the major truck route on Long Island, he said, accidents often involve large trailer-trucks, which are difficult to turn upright. "Often it's necessary to unload them before your can tow them or turn them right side up, and that can take time," he said.</p>
        <p>"I'm a commuter myself," he added, "so believe me, I know it's critical to get the road back open again."</p>
