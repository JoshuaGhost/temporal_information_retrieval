        <p>SOON AFTER THE Collapse of the Soviet Union, functionaries of the Government-owned television, radio and record industries discovered an entrepreneurial streak. They opened their archives to Western producers who had dreamed for decades of the artistic treasures those archives might have held.</p>
        <p>The immediate result, as with other early Russian ventures in capitalism, was chaos. When the state radio opened up its holdings for bids by foreign record labels, musicians whose work was being offered protested that they had been left out of the payment scheme. And in at least one prominent case (that of the Melodiya label, now distributed in the United States by BMG Classics) "exclusive" rights were parceled off to several companies at once, and Western courts were left to sort through the conflicting contracts.</p>
        <p>But Bruno Monsaingeon, a video producer best known for his work with the pianist Glenn Gould during Gould's last years, has made his way through this minefield and emerged, seemingly unscathed, with performance film of the violinist David Oistrakh. Oistrakh, who died in 1974, was revered in the violin world, but because of the cultural freezes and general awkwardness of the cold war, he was a distant figure for American listeners.</p>
        <p>Born in Odessa in 1908, he was one of the first great instrumentalists to come of age during the Soviet era. His victory at the 1937 Ysaye Competition in Brussels carried him to international attention, and his friendships with Glazunov, Prokofiev, Miaskovsky and Shostakovich helped establish him as an authoritative interpreter of their works.</p>
        <p>He did not make his American debut until 1955, and when he did, it was a bona fide event: Carnegie Hall was filled with violinists, and although Mischa Elman and Nathan Milstein performed on the same day, Oistrakh's debut was the talk of the town. He returned a half-dozen times in the 1960's, and that was it for his American concert career.</p>
        <p>Recordings crossed the ocean more easily, and at the time they afforded a firm impression of Oistrakh as an elegant stylist. They seem even more revealing now that we have heard from the next generation. Oistrakh abandoned some (though not all) of his predecessors' rhythmic elasticity and showy embellishments but maintained the essentials of the early-20th-century Russian school: the carefully manipulated, singing tone, the thoughtfully personalized phrasing and the sense that passion ruled musical discourse. His idea of passion may have been tempered by rationality, but it had more in common with Elman's Romanticism than with the mechanistic, sometimes seemingly heartless precision of the 80's Soviet school.</p>
        <p>THE FILM THAT MR. Monsaingeon has discovered helps fill out the picture. The first of several planned Oistrakh releases, "Archival Treasures" (EMI 77804, laser disk; 77803, VHS cassette) is built around televised performances of the Sibelius Concerto, from February 1966, and the Tchaikovsky Concerto, from September 1968, both conducted by Gennady Rozhdestvensky. Each is followed by an encore from the same concert and preceded by unrelated short clips Mr. Monsaingeon turned up in a search he began in 1979.</p>
        <p>There is a certain homey quality to the concerto presentations, a sense of eavesdropping on 1960's Soviet television. Camera technique turns out not to have been a high priority. In much of the Sibelius, Oistrakh is nearly in silhouette, but the cameramen seem to have hit on the fine points of lighting in time for the Tchaikovsky broadcast. Although the liner notes speak of heroic efforts to restore film found "in a well-nigh desperate condition," a pervasive graininess remains. And listeners who cringe at misplaced applause in American concert halls may be taken aback by the ovation after the first movement of the Tchaikovsky.</p>
        <p>The Sibelius performance is the stronger of the two. The orchestra's opening pianissimo ripple and Oistrakh's dark-hued statement of the theme establish the work's spirit perfectly, and the violinist's gorgeously textured tone and nuanced phrasing make for a warm, emotionally vibrant performance.</p>
        <p>Some imperfections in the Tchaikovsky merely make the reading more gripping. Some of Oistrakh's chordal figurations waver between staccato and brash choppiness, and at moments in the cadenza when the score calls for pure, ringing tones, Oistrakh's bow momentarily catches a second string.</p>
        <p>Minor glitches like these would be sanitized in a studio performance; here they add a human element that recordings too rarely let us see. And what are a few technical blemishes in a performance that thrives on big, assertive dynamic gestures and a real sense of interaction between soloist, conductor and orchestra? Few recordings of the work have the tension Oistrakh brings to the solo writing; fewer still equal this one for the catharsis of the orchestra's brassy return after the cadenza.</p>
        <p>The short selections, though not the collection's primary focus, add a great deal. In the earliest, filmed at a studio in 1937, a trim, youthful Oistrakh plays Kreisler's "Liebeslied" and affords a glimpse into his interpretive process. Uninterested in the confectionary aspects that attracted other violinists to Kreisler's music, he seems intent on finding more substantial emotion. His varied coloration, his way of holding back slightly at phrase ends and his sparing use of portamento suggest an unusually dry-eyed nostalgia. The performance is not entirely successful, sounding stiff at times.</p>
        <p>In a 1953 excerpt from Lalo's "Symphonie Espagnole" and in the encores (Beethoven's Romance No. 1 and Mr. Rozhdestvensky's flashy arrangement of a Locatelli caprice). He shows greater fire and a broader coloristic range. But the most winning short clip is an eight-and-a-half-minute excerpt from a rehearsal of Beethoven's "Kreutzer" Sonata, filmed in Japan in 1967. The sound is hissy and a bit tinny, and the camera stays tight on Oistrakh's by now jowly face. But the performance, with Frieda Bauer at the piano, is so electrifying that even the brief interruptions hardly break the mood. Here's hoping Mr. Monsaingeon has found a complete performance of the work for a future volume.  VIDEO VIEW</p>
