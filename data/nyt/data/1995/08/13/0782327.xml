        <p>HOW do you remove a deer from a hotel lobby? Very carefully, decided Joan Wyatt-Filer of the Fire Island Hotel and Resort in Ocean Bay Park. "We said, 'Shoo!' " she recalled, "and we got him out, but not before he wet the rug."</p>
        <p>Since Ms. Wyatt-Filer and her husband, Ric Filer, took over the managerial duties of the hotel a year and a half ago, they have made contact with a variety of wildlife, both the four- and two-legged versions.</p>
        <p>Deer are abundant on Fire Island. So are singles. Both groups gravitate to the hotel, a former Coast Guard station 200 yards from the ocean. But the owners of the hotel, Charles (Chuck) Rogers and Ed Eschmann, prefer catering to families. So couples with children stay during the week. Single men and women take over on the weekends. That makes for a fascinating transition on Friday nights, when the Fire Island Hotel changes from Disney World to Club Med.</p>
        <p>"I get a call at 4:30 in the morning," Ms. Wyatt-Filer said. "It's the family in Room 4 complaining that some singles have just come in to the room next door and they're making all sorts of noise, and Room 4 has children, and the children can't sleep. Then I get a call at 6:30 A.M. from Room 6 saying, 'There are kids next door and they just woke us up, and we only got in at 4:30 and we're trying to sleep."'</p>
        <p>Such is life in the hotel business on Fire Island, a place where many people do not realize that there is a hotel business. The island is known for its summer homes and day tripping.  Few people realize that there is a third option, to spend the night on the island.</p>
        <p>But overnight tourists should be prepared. There is no Hyatt, not even a Motel 6. Hotel accommodations on Fire Island are rustic. Although rates range from approximately $100 to $200 a night in season, the amenities are sparse. The Fire Island Hotel in Ocean Bay Park is one of the few establishments that has bathrooms in every room. It is the only one that has a pool. And air-conditioning "is a luxury upgrade," according to Ms. Wyatt-Filer. In most of the 34 rooms and 10 cottages "we have fans," she said.</p>
        <p>With this summer's heat wave, some guests imported their own coolness. Last weekend six women from Centereach arrived carrying electric fans. "We come here each year," Kerri Daley of Centereach said. "We know how hot it can get."</p>
        <p>But that doesn't stop the women from enjoying their Fire Island holiday. "We're friends from high school," said Jean Vernagallo, who was carrying her child's boogie board. "I brought the board," she said, "not the child. We leave the husbands and children at home and we party."</p>
        <p>The women's luggage included two giant coolers. "We have our blender in there," Mrs. Vernagallo said, "and all the mixes."</p>
        <p>Arriving at the same time was Ira Kostrinsky of Roslyn with his daughter Taylor, 5, and his mother, Sheila. They were hotel hopping on the Island. "We just stayed in Ocean Beach," Mr. Kostrinsky said. "Every chance I get I come to Fire Island. I like the beach."</p>
        <p>And the rural life?</p>
        <p>"I'm not a camper," he said. "This is as rural as I get. Tonight we'll get a water taxi and go to dinner at Cherry Grove."</p>
        <p>As Lulu the hotel parrot screeched in the background and ceiling fans whirled, an employee, Ann Marie Craven, painstakingly wrote the guests' names in a large ledger. "I'm the computer," she said as she sat at the front desk, the only desk in the room.</p>
        <p>"We tried a real computer last year," Ms. Wyatt-Filer said. "It ate our entire season of reservations."</p>
        <p>Salt and humidity can wreak havoc on mechanical devices. Just ask Billy Collins, the tattooed maintenance worker at the Fire Island Hotel. It is Mr. Collins's responsibility to keep the 90-year-old hotel operating. Given the distance to the nearest Home Depot, Mr. Collins is revered by the managers.</p>
        <p>" 'What's the difference between a maintenance man and a miracle worker?' " Mr. Filer said. "A maintenance man lives on the mainland next to a hardware store."</p>
        <p>Operating a hotel on an island presents a host of challenges, like transportation. The lone way to obtain supplies is by freight boat. "When you run out of toilet paper," Mr. Filer said, "you really run out of toilet paper."</p>
        <p>The only way visitors can travel to Fire Island is by ferry. (Yes, they could walk from Robert Moses State Park. But trying carrying a Louis Vuitton suitcase over a dune.)</p>
        <p>As guests disembark from the ferry, the hotel bellhop greets them. He drives a golf cart, for the luggage. The guests have to walk. "When they call," Ms. Wyatt-Filer said, "we tell them, 'We'll meet your luggage.' The people follow behind."</p>
        <p>Over the telephone the hotel manager prepares first-time visitors to the realities of island living. "I say, 'Have you ever been to Fire Island?' " she said. "I try not to make it sound like something it's not. I explain that a T-shirt over a wet bathing suit is dressing up for dinner."</p>
        <p>That is one of the pleasures of Fire Island versus the Hamptons, Mr. Rogers said. "No one tries to impress any one here," he said. "Formal is a clean T-shirt."</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers and his wife, Natalie Katz Rogers, live in Ocean Beach. Mr. Rogers commutes to his hotel by bicycle.</p>
        <p>"But I can't ride it in Ocean Beach," he said. "That's the land of no. So I walk my bike to the edge of the village. Then I hop on."</p>
        <p>The lack of riding of any sort -- no cars are allowed on the island, except by permit -- makes Fire Island a perfect place to vacation with children. "You don't have to worry about streets and traffic," Mr. Rogers said.</p>
        <p>There are not many places to travel to. The lure of the island is the beach and tranquillity. But a hotel feels some responsibility to offer recreation. So besides the Ping Pong table and jungle gym, the Fire Island Hotel has an artist visit every Wednesday to offer guests art lessons. "Plus," Ms. Wyatt-Filer said, "we have recreational trips to Sunken Forest with Ranger Bob. That's my father. He's a self-taught naturalist."</p>
        <p>The hotel is a family affair. Ms. Wyatt-Filer's uncle is Mr. Rogers, and his sister, Ms. Wyatt-Filer's mother, is Joan Wyatt, who runs the gift shop. The shop, a partitioned area of the lobby, sells hand-painted T-shirts and seashell bags. The painting and shelling are by Mrs. Wyatt and her sister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eschmann's brother Don runs the new Hurricane Bar and Grill, which consists of five tables covered with flowered vinyl tablecloths.</p>
        <p>Guests' rooms are spartan. But Mr. Eschmann said they were luxurious compared to the way they were before he and Mr. Rogers took over the hotel several years ago. "These rooms were the Coast Guard dormitory," he said on a tour. "For many years the hotel kept the Coast Guard's furniture. It was Army issue. We redecorated the place."</p>
        <p>Don't expect Laura Ashley. "We bought the furniture and pictures from a Miami Beach hotel," he said "and we added mirrors and TV's -- and bathrooms."</p>
        <p>MacKenzie Taylor of Bay Shore was cleaning a room. "Sand," she said as she took out a heavy-duty vacuum cleaner. "There is always a lot of sand, and pebbles in the shower." When she is not working as a chambermaid, Ms. Taylor is a nursing student at Molloy College. "She knows how to make a hospital corner," Ms. Wyatt-Filer said as Ms. Taylor grabbed a sheet.</p>
        <p>On a wall was a bug of enormous proportions. "I'll get the repellent," Ms. Taylor said. "It's part of my cleaning supplies."</p>
        <p>The tools of the trade are quite different for an island hotel than a New York City one, like the garden hose on the wall in case of a fire. "It's code for Fire Island," Mr. Eschmann said.</p>
        <p>The rustic touches appeal to many guests. Elnora Hayes, a former actress and model, has been returning for 35 years. "I don't have to wear makeup here,"she said.</p>
        <p>Or clothes. Another guest, Ethel Schlesinger of Manhattan, was spending most of her time in her bathing suit. Ms. Schlesinger liked staying overnight on Fire Island, "because with day trips you get all grungy, and there is no place to change."</p>
        <p>Bill Briggs of Boston and Yvonne Furrer of New Jersey had just changed into their traveling clothes. They were finishing up three days at the hotel, and their first visit to Fire Island. "We really enjoyed it," Mr. Briggs said, "but a little air-conditioning would have been nice."</p>
        <p>The other negative, he said, was the cost of parking the car by the ferry in Bay Shore. "What a rip-off," he said. "Forty dollars to park a car. We didn't expect New York City prices."</p>
        <p>Most people learn to accept the higher costs of everything associated with Fire Island. Europeans think it is a bargain. "We're getting more and more people from Europe," Mr. Eschmann said. "We've learned the English like tea in the afternoon, no matter what the weather."</p>
        <p>"A man from London," Ms. Wyatt-Filer said, "met a woman from London here. It turned out they lived on the same block. They came all the way to Fire Island to meet and discover they were neighbors."</p>
        <p>To appeal more to world travelers, Mr. Eschmann said, he will introduce a new feature next year. "We're going to have rickshaws take the people from the ferry to the hotel," he said. He figures that there are enough college students who are looking for summer employment to pull the rickshaws. "Why wouldn't they want the job?" he asked. "Can you imagine the tips?" Or the looks on accountants' faces when they receive expense vouchers for a Fire Island rickshaw pull.  ABOUT LONG ISLAND</p>
