        <p>ALTHOUGH prosthetic surgeons dream of replacing severed limbs with mechanical surrogates controlled directly by the living nervous system, the creation of "bionic" hybrids like Darth Vader of "Star Wars" and the Six Million-Dollar Man remains purely imaginary.

        <p>ALTHOUGH prosthetic surgeons dream of replacing severed limbs with mechanical surrogates controlled directly by the living nervous system, the creation of "bionic" hybrids like Darth Vader of "Star Wars" and the Six Million-Dollar Man remains purely imaginary. But a team of German biophysicists has now taken a small step toward mating man and machine by opening a two-way communication link between a silicon chip and a leech's nerve cell.</p>
        <p>The achievement, by Dr. Peter Fromherz and his research team at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry at Martinsried, near Munich, Germany, was described in a paper published yesterday in the journal Physical Review Letters. The group reports that it has built a new type of junction between a microscopic spot on a silicon chip and a corresponding spot on a leech neuron. A novel feature of the system is that no electric current passes from the chip to the neuron; the chip stimulates the neuron to "fire," or respond, by inducing an electric charge inside the leech cell. Leech neurons were used for reasons of convenience, but the technique can presumably be adapted to human nerve cells.</p>
        <p>Since the late 18th century, when the Italian experimenters Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta showed that electrical stimuli cause muscle tissue to contract, scientists have explored the electrochemical pathways by which nerves are made to fire, thereby sending sensory signals to the brain or transmitting orders from the brain to muscles and other body parts.</p>
        <p>But such experiments have generally involved a current of electricity applied to tissue by a metal electrode or some other conductor -- a technique that causes corrosion of the electrode and that poisons, heats and damages the tissue. Dr. Fromherz has devised a way to send a signal to a nerve cell using capacitive stimulation, in which electric charges are rearranged without any flow of current. An electric voltage applied to the interior of the chip produces an electric field that induces a charge inside the cell, and when this charge reaches a certain threshold level, the cell fires, initiating the electrochemical sequence by which nerve cells communicate with their neighbors.</p>
        <p>The successful transmission of signals from the chip to the leech neuron complements an achievement by Dr. Fromherz's team four years ago, when the researchers found a way for a chip to translate the impulse of a leech nerve cell into a voltage change in a chip containing a "field effect" transistor, also without any flow of electricity.</p>
        <p>The accomplishment announced yesterday has thus established a signaling channel between a nerve cell and a silicon chip that works in both directions -- an essential requirement for any future prosthetic limb controlled by the brain through a living nervous system.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fromherz said in an interview that his group had worked with neurons dissected from leech ganglia, or nerve bundles, because leech nerve cells are relatively large and therefore easier to manipulate than the nerve cells from most other animals. Even so, the working dimensions are very small; a leech neuron is only about 50 microns (50-millionths of a meter) long, roughly half the diameter of a human hair. The contact point on the neuron is only 30 microns across, and it must be brought into precise contact with a transistor on the chip, which is about 5 microns on a side.</p>
        <p>Although some of the operations necessary to assemble these microscopic junctions can be done by hand under a microscope, others require computer-controlled micromanipulators capable of positioning objects with a precision of a few millionths of a meter.</p>
        <p>The chips used by the group contain a charge-carrying silicon layer covered by a thin insulating layer of silicon oxide. This layer, in contact with the leech nerve membrane, blocks any flow of electricity, but is permeable to the electric field induced by the silicon layer beneath it. To measure electric changes within the cell, the group injects a microscopic electrode into the cell.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fromherz has created junctions with as many as 16 contact points between a chip and a single neuron. The neurons include two types which, in a live leech, have different functions. One type fires when the leech is gently touched, causing the leech to move, and another type fires when the leech is hurt, causing it to withdraw.</p>
        <p>But the mere creation of a communication link with a neuron does not in itself open the way to building bionic limbs, he said, noting that capacitive coupling, or "hyperpolarization," as he has named his laboratory technique, is not the mechanism by which living cells communicate. Neurons transmit their messages to neighbors by chemical changes at their synapses, or joining points.</p>
        <p>One of the obstacles to integrating a silicon chip with a living nervous system, he said, will be maintaining intimate contact between the chip and the neurons.</p>
        <p>"Implanting a device like this in living tissue will be extremely difficult, and many things will happen that don't pose problems using clean, isolated neurons in the laboratory," he said. "In tissue, many things -- whole cells or proteins, for instance -- can come between the neuron and our device, spoiling the coupling."</p>
        <p>To maintain tight bonds between biological tissue and silicon-based contact points, scientific teams in Europe, Asia and the United States are experimenting with various adhesive peptide chains and proteins, which form chemical links between surfaces.</p>
        <p>One such team, which is developing chemical bonds between live neurons and Teflon, includes scientists at the State University of New York at Buffalo; the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington; Korea Standards Research in Daejon, Korea; the Lausanne University Medical School in Switzerland, and the Kodak Research Laboratories in Rochester.</p>
        <p>In a series of recent papers in The Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, the team reported that it could bond protein to etched patterns on the surface of a Teflon film, and then use the patterns as templates for the directed growth of nerve cells. In principle, a Teflon template could act as a scaffold for growing a neural network.</p>
        <p>"We at SUNY Buffalo haven't done anything so elaborate as that," said Dr. Joseph A. Gardella Jr., a chemist participating in the project. "Our interest was more in the wound-healing area: directed neural tissue growth for the purpose of repairing nerve injuries."</p>
        <p>Dr. Gardella said that fluoropolymers like Teflon, the anti-sticking coating used on cookware, are already widely used as scaffolding material in biomedical implants. For example, the fluoropolymer Gortex, a product of W. L. Gore &amp; Associates of New Jersey that is widely used as an insulating liner for clothing and gloves, has been recruited in the fight against dental periodontal disease. Gortex, a chemical sibling of Teflon, provides an inert mesh of porous scaffolding on which replacement bone cells can be grown in desired patterns.</p>
        <p>"Surgeons are also experimenting with Gortex sleeves for seeding cells to repair the cardiovascular system," Dr. Gardella said, "and this kind of material shows promise for directed nerve-cell growth as well."</p>
        <p>To etch a pattern on a Teflon film, the Buffalo group masks the material with nickel, through which the pattern of an intended neural pathway has been cut out. The nickel-masked Teflon is then exposed to a blast of hot plasma -- ionized gas -- which penetrates the gaps in the nickel mask and replaces fluorine atoms in the nonreactive Teflon with highly reactive hydroxyl groups along the etched lines.</p>
        <p>In the next step, special peptides derived from a cell-attachment promoter called laminin are brought into contact with the etched pattern and chemically bonded to the reactive hydroxyl groups along the etched lines. Finally, live neurons placed on the template bond to the peptides and use peptide channels as guides for their own growth.</p>
        <p>The technique borrows ideas developed by the semiconductor industry, which uses lithographic technology to manufacture the intricate microscopic circuits on which chips are based.</p>
        <p>"It is possible to lithograph a neural network," Dr. Gardella said, "but what I can't tell you is whether it would function. So far, we've been using permanent cell cultures, and these we can grow in lithographed patterns, but we haven't tried using primary human nerve cells. We don't know yet whether we could implant something like this in a live person and have it work."</p>
        <p>But experiments in directed neural growth using many types of cells continue.</p>
        <p>At the Max Planck Institute, Dr. Fromherz's group has begun a study of the behavior of neurons from the hippocampus of rat brains.</p>
        <p>"These hippocampus cells are much more difficult to handle than leech neurons, because they are very much smaller," Dr. Fromherz said, "but on the other hand, they survive for months at a time, while leech neurons can be kept alive for only a week or so.</p>
        <p>"And there's another reason hippocampus cells are interesting. The hippocampus is believed to be a seat of memory."</p>
        <p>Does this mean that scientists hope someday to create a direct interface between a silicon chip and one of the main engines of thought?</p>
        <p>"We'll never see a day when the Encyclopaedia Britannica could be transmitted by a chip into the brain," he said, "but what we do hope to create is a neural network of rat cells that would survive for long enough that we could study its development in detail, using thousands of attached transistors. A little at a time, we progress."</p>
