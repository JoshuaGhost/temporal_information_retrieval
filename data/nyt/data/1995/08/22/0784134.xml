        <p>New figures on the German economy were announced yesterday that prompted economists to say the country's growth outlook was darkening again. The Economics Ministry said industrial orders fell 3.5 percent in June from May after a 3 percent rise in May from April. The Federal Statistics Office said western German producer prices fell one-tenth of a percent in July from June, the first fall since September. Prices were up 1.9 percent from July 1994. In Munich, the economic research institute Ifo said its monthly business confidence index fell to 97.5 in July from 99 in June, its lowest level in 15 months. (Reuters)</p>
