        <p>With sales sluggish, the truck division of Ford Motor Company's Brazilian subsidiary in Sao Paolo said yesterday that it would lay off 800 of its 3,000 workers. The announcement was made a day after General Motors said it had laid off 1,050 assembly line workers at its two plants in the state of Sao Paulo. Ford said it expected to first lay off 260 workers who had been hired on a temporary basis and whose contracts expired in December. A further 290 would be let go in September and 250 in October. A spokesman also said Ford would do away with the night shift and reduce its monthly output from 140 trucks to 110.(AP)</p>
