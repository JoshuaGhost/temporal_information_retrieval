        <p>A Paterson man and woman and a Port Authority police officer were injured early yesterday morning after a police chase. The man and woman, riding a stolen motorcycle, were being pursued by Paterson housing police when their vehicle rammed a patrol car at the entrance to the George Washington Bridge, the authorities said. The man, Christopher Williams, 24, and the woman, Rasheeda Williams, 18, were hospitalized in stable condition last night. Officer Gary Griffith, who was in the patrol car, was treated and released. Officials said that Mr. Williams was charged with theft of movable property and eluding the police after he refused to pull over. They said the couple would also be charged with aggravated assault of a police officer. TERRY PRISTIN</p>
