        <p>"Watch it, Kathy," Randall Stechert said as his girlfriend crouched in front of the yardlong Eastern timber rattlesnake that was exploring an armchair in their living room.</p>
        <p>"Oh, it's all right," Kathleen Michell replied.</p>
        <p>She had draped the venomous female snake on the chair while she replaced the soiled towel that lined its plywood box. "She processed her mouse very nicely," Ms. Michell said, examining a smudge of rodent remains.</p>
        <p>Such is life in a household devoted to the study and care of rattlesnakes and an assortment of other reptiles. The couple met five years ago when one of Ms. Michell's sons spotted a timber rattlesnake den in a quarry near her house along the Delaware River in Sullivan County and Mr. Stechert was dispatched by the state to study it. Since then, they have combined their skills to become a his-and-hers reptile research team.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Ms. Michell, 47, who trains emergency medical technicians, turned her medical skills to snake surgery and turtle-shell repair and became a part-time, state-licensed wildlife rehabilitator.</p>
        <p>For more than 14 years, Mr. Stechert, 43, a naturalist, has been helping New York State environmental officials track Crotalus horridus, the Eastern timber rattler. Never bitten in more than 15 years of field work, he said the timber rattler, whose preferred prey is field mice, is far more threatened than threatening.</p>
        <p>The species, which in New York occupies rocky ridges from northern Westchester into Dutchess County and also a swath of terrain west of the Hudson, has been steadily depleted by poachers who supply a growing underground trade in exotic animals. State wildlife officials say Eastern timber rattlers, prized for their bright coloration and rarity, can fetch up to $200 from collectors as far away as Europe and Asia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stechert's latest study, for the United States Military Academy, was designed not so much to protect West Point's cadets as to protect the territory of the snakes, which are listed as an endangered species in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and several other Eastern states.</p>
        <p>The three-year, $39,000 study turned decidedly sour last month when Mr. Stechert began tracking a radio beacon that Ms. Michell had implanted in a rattlesnake shortly after they released it near its winter den. Suddenly, the chirping signal impossibly shifted hundreds of yards through the forest in a matter of minutes. It became clear that the transmitter was lodged in a much fleeter creature than a snake -- probably a coyote that had eaten it.</p>
        <p>If so, this was the second snake subject to be snagged by a coyote in as many years, Mr. Stechert said. "As if they don't already have enough to worry about," he added.</p>
        <p>Ms. Michell had fond memories of that gold and brown male. "He's one of the two nicest rattlesnakes I've ever met," she said, adding that the other was a pregnant dark female she had cared for and then released. "They would have made a great couple," she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stechert said he is often asked why anyone should care about the fate of rattlesnakes. "It's the height of ignorance to ask what good is something," he said. "These snakes are a vital component of the ecosystem. They control rodents, and they are eaten by great horned owls -- and now, it looks like, by coyotes."</p>
        <p>He added, "They're colorful, impressive animals that just want to be left alone."</p>
        <p>Most humans are bitten only when a snake is repeatedly harassed, Mr. Stechert said, and no one has been killed by a rattlesnake bite in the Northeast since at least 1930.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stechert was surrounded with wildlife from an early age. His father, Carl, was a naturalist for the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, and his mother, although repulsed by reptiles, was happy to have wild mammals around. "Instead of the family dog, we had a family raccoon," he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Michell said she was born with a love of reptiles and amphibians, to the consternation of her parents. When she was 4, she said, her mother found some eggs buried in the garden of their New Jersey home. Thinking they belonged to a poisonous snake, she discarded them. The daughter tried to save the eggs by hiding them in a bush outside the front door, but her parents forced her to reveal them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Michell's 15-year-old son, Robert, is carrying on the herpetological tradition by gluing tiny transmitters to the backs of wood turtles that he plans to track.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Stechert moved into Ms. Michell's house last fall, they merged two already impressive animal collections. Along with two dogs, a cockatiel, two canaries and the living room full of rattlesnakes, the house now harbors a Sinaloan milk snake, a hog-nosed snake with a repaired skull fracture, a copperhead and an enormous collection of turtles with a variety of ailments or injuries.</p>
        <p>Ms. Michell had bought some box turtles from pet shops to rid them of infections and return them to the wild. Other types of turtles scrabbled in various corners of the house.</p>
        <p>The largest, Samantha, a snapping turtle the size of a toaster oven, was eating slices of nectarine as it floated in the claw-foot bathtub upstairs. The 11-pound turtle was recuperating from skull and beak fractures it received when it was struck by a car.</p>
        <p>Always experimenting with new materials, Ms. Michell was preparing to repair the beak crack with waterproof adhesive her dentist had used on her son's braces.</p>
        <p>Smiling at her, Mr. Stechert said, "She's got a real soft spot for turtles."</p>
