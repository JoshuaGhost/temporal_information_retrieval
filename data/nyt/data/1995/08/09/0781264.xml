        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Can you sublet space on the astral plane?</p>
        <p>I wondered about this as I stood in line at my Greenwich Village health-food store and overheard the following exchange between a customer and the cashier:</p>
        <p>Customer: I'm moving to Sedona next week.</p>
        <p>Clerk: Lucky you. That's such a special place.</p>
        <p>Customer: I know! I feel like I'm not just moving to another town but to a higher level of consciousness.</p>
        <p>Clerk: So you're really giving up your apartment here?</p>
        <p>Customer: Are you kidding? I'm rent stabilized. BILL BARBANES</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Scene: A supermarket in West Orange, N.J.</p>
        <p>Dramatis personae: Attractive woman with neatly coiffured blond hair; she wears a pale blue pants suit. She walks up and down the aisles very slowly, a result of her surgical collar and three-pronged cane. A box of cereal is tucked under her free arm.</p>
        <p>She looks up and recognizes another shopper.</p>
        <p>"Helen?" she says.</p>
        <p>"Beverly?" the woman says uncertainly. "I haven't seen you in ages. How have you been? You look terrific! Keep in touch!" DOROTHY C. GOLDBERG</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Heard the other day at my nail salon in Little Silver, N.J. -- a 20-something manicurist to her client:</p>
        <p>"We like to go out for dinner on Saturday night and then go to the Hilton for an after-dinner drink. They play nice music -- classical -- like Frank Sinatra." ARLEEN NATELSON</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>At dinner recently at a cafe on East 18th Street, my husband and I couldn't help overhearing a conversation between two women of a certain age, one of whom almost drowned out the other.</p>
        <p>The strident portion we heard went something like this:</p>
        <p>"No, I don't do that! You always say I do, but I don't!"</p>
        <p>"You're not listening! It's not me. You've got me mixed up with somebody else."</p>
        <p>"I'm telling you I don't do that! I always press the eye. I don't shake. Listen to me! I never shook a cantaloupe in my life!" SUSAN THOMSEN</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>A beautiful nonhumid summer evening finds William Irvine and a friend enjoying an outdoor dinner at L'Ardoise on the Upper East Side. When the waiter asks for their drink order, they also request water.</p>
        <p>"Would you prefer San Pellegrino or Giuliani?" the waiter asks.</p>
        <p>. . .</p>
        <p>SUMMER PLAINT</p>
        <p>I disagree with Whittier's thought</p>
        <p>on what words are the saddest.</p>
        <p>For me a different mood is caught</p>
        <p>That also makes me maddest.</p>
        <p>My "sad words of tongue or pen"</p>
        <p>That I in heat had spoken,</p>
        <p>I hope I never hear again</p>
        <p>"The air-conditioner's broken." RUTH WARD</p>
        <p>.. .</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>To be filed under "D," as in differences between raising city kids and country kids.</p>
        <p>A New York City couple I know are spending the summer in Putnam County with their 5-year-old son. Overheard on a recent afternoon, a brief conversation between city kid and mother of country kid.</p>
        <p>Mom: Guess what. Today we're going to a mall.</p>
        <p>Son: Wow! Is that going to be like "Amahl and the Night Visitors?" JEAN MARKS</p>
