        <p>Hundreds of people poured into two neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn last night as participants in yesterday afternoon's Dominican Day Parade in Manhattan continued their celebrations, the police said.</p>
        <p>Five people were arrested for disorderly conduct in Corona, Queens, as about 200 police officers filled the area near 100th Street and 37th Avenue, said Doram Tamari, a police spokesman. One man was arrested for throwing a bottle at a police officer, who was struck in the arm, said Tom Kelly, deputy commissioner of public information.</p>
        <p>Commissioner Kelly said the disorder started when a fight broke out among the revelers, and the police intervened. About 200 unruly people, out of a crowd of more than 1,000, had dispersed by 11:30 P.M., the police said.</p>
        <p>"Everyone was having a good time," said Jose Perales, 21, who works in a pool hall in Corona. "Nobody was throwing bottles. We started throwing bottles when they started hitting everybody."</p>
        <p>In Manhattan yesterday afternoon, the festivities centered around a parade on the Avenue of Americas.</p>
        <p>Officers were also called to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where the police reported an unruly crowd. No arrests were reported.</p>
