        <p>"ALLEN DRURY has a new book out?" my friend the been-there-wrote-that Washington journalist said, unable to hide his amazement. "Allen Drury is still alive?"</p>
        <p>Well, yes. Thirty-six years after "Advise and Consent" spawned one of the most successful literary genres in American pop fiction, Mr. Drury has brought out his 13th novel set in Washington, "A Thing of State" (Scribner). Although Orrin Knox, Bob Munson and the other characters featured in "Advise and Consent" and its five increasingly dire sequels took early retirement long ago, Mr. Drury is still up to his familiar tricks: bad guys in the Middle East, bad guys in the White House, bad guys in the Washington press corps (the only thing Mr. Drury hates more than a wimpy politician is a liberal columnist), all simmering gently in a rich stew of adjectives. Raymond Cass Stanley, the Secretary of State, is "long, lean, lanky" and possessed of "a flintlike honesty and integrity." Joan Cohn-Bourassa, the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, is "small, dark, driving, and intense, intense, intense." And the world, as ever and always, is in, shall we say, a parlous state: "Nowhere in all the vast expanse of humanity's desperate strivings is there any really convincing evidence for hope."</p>

        <p>"ALLEN DRURY has a new book out?" my friend the been-there-wrote-that Washington journalist said, unable to hide his amazement. "Allen Drury is still alive?"</p>
        <p>Well, yes. Thirty-six years after "Advise and Consent" spawned one of the most successful literary genres in American pop fiction, Mr. Drury has brought out his 13th novel set in Washington, "A Thing of State" (Scribner). Although Orrin Knox, Bob Munson and the other characters featured in "Advise and Consent" and its five increasingly dire sequels took early retirement long ago, Mr. Drury is still up to his familiar tricks: bad guys in the Middle East, bad guys in the White House, bad guys in the Washington press corps (the only thing Mr. Drury hates more than a wimpy politician is a liberal columnist), all simmering gently in a rich stew of adjectives. Raymond Cass Stanley, the Secretary of State, is "long, lean, lanky" and possessed of "a flintlike honesty and integrity." Joan Cohn-Bourassa, the Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern Affairs, is "small, dark, driving, and intense, intense, intense." And the world, as ever and always, is in, shall we say, a parlous state: "Nowhere in all the vast expanse of humanity's desperate strivings is there any really convincing evidence for hope."</p>
        <p>Mr. Drury, in short, is doing business at the same old stand. Unfortunately for him, the highway has moved. Blockbuster novels about Washington as It Really Is are as dead as disco, victims of what might be called Grisham's Law: in popular culture, trash gets trashier over time. We're talking Washington-as-it-really-is books, mind you, not how-to-get-there books. The campaign book, fictional or nonfictional, is another thing altogether, and is alive and well at least every four years; addicts with an eye on 1996 have to look forward, among other things, to a Clinton '92 roman a clef by an allegedly anonymous author said to be a big-time political reporter.</p>
        <p>Gone, however, are the leisurely stemwinders about life and times in the capital. "The mystery-thriller genre has taken over completely," laments Terri Merz, co-owner of Chapters: A Literary Bookstore, located right around the corner from the White House and frequented by the likes of Irving Kristol and Gary Hart. "And those books aren't serious, satisfying Washington novels." Actually, they're more like comic books. A novel like William S. Cohen's "One-Eyed Kings" (1991), with its jut-jawed investigative reporters and slinky Mossad assassins, has far more in common with "Goldfinger" than "Advise and Consent."</p>
        <p>Dead though the old-fashioned Washington novel may be, the genre definitely left its mark on impressionable readers of the period. In a recent appearance on "Face the Nation," Newt Gingrich informed the world that he thought the United States should recognize Taiwan; he subsequently confessed that his gambit (which he didn't really mean) "came out of a scene in 'Advise and Consent.' " And Peggy Noonan recalled in "What I Saw at the Revolution" (1990) that every baby boomer in the Reagan White House "had read 'Advise and Consent' and at least one other of Allen Drury's wonderful old novels about Washington. We had read them in the 60's, when we were young, and they were part of the reason we were here."</p>
        <p>Nor was Mr. Drury unique. Back in the 60's and 70's, Washington novels were a staple item of the book business. "Seven Days in May," "Power Play," "The Man," "The President's Plane Is Missing," for example: who now remembers them? And what killed them off?</p>
        <p>Contrary to popular belief, Allen Drury did not invent the Washington novel; Henry Adams beat him to the punch. But few novelists followed the lead of "Democracy: An American Novel" (1880), and fewer still of any importance. There is John Dos Passos' now-forgotten book "The Grand Design" (1949), but the best novels about American politics, Robert Penn Warren's "All the King's Men" (1946), and Edwin O'Connor's "All in the Family" (1966) and "The Last Hurrah" (1956), are, significantly, not about Washington at all.</p>
        <p>Unlike his more recent predecessors, Allen Drury was not a novelist de metier: he started out as a Washington correspondent. And "Advise and Consent," the story of a confirmation fight that leads to the suicide of a senator, the resignation of a majority leader and the death of a President, is very much a reporter's novel, full of the inside skinny. Some of Mr. Drury's senators drink too much and sleep around; some remain in loveless marriages to further their political careers; one, a promising young Mormon from Utah, has a homosexual past. (Tony Kushner, call your office.) Like all clubmen, they mostly like one another and mostly get along, and not infrequently strike private deals that have nothing to do with party politics.</p>
        <p>If all this sounds old hat, bear in mind that Mr. Drury was writing long before Politics as Life Style became an obsession of American journalists. When he came along, nobody was covering Washington politicians as personalities, at least not with anything remotely approaching candor. C-Span and the Style section of The Washington Post were far in the future. Yet the appetite for personality journalism about politicians had already been created by radio and television: all that remained was to feed it. Mr. Drury did so with a vengeance, and thereby became rich, famous and the proud owner of the 1960 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.</p>
        <p>"Advise and Consent" also sold because, like all big-selling novels, it told its readers what they wanted to hear. In 1959, Americans were digging fallout shelters and watching Nikita Khrushchev cavort menacingly on TV. They saw the Soviet Union as a concrete threat to their continued existence, and wanted desperately to believe that American politicians, whatever their differences, were collectively up to the task of keeping the Russians on ice. The containment of the Soviet Union is the only ideological issue at stake in "Advise and Consent": every character is defined by whether or not he is soft on Communism. And though there are villains in Mr. Drury's Washington, never is it suggested for a moment that every politician is a liar and a thief. In fact, nearly all of his characters seek earnestly to do the right thing: "Just when things seem at their most cynical, something comes along that appeals to idealism and fair play, and the forces of deceit go down before it like tenpins."</p>
        <p>THESE sentiments were decidedly in vogue in 1959. Never was public faith in government's capacity to do good as unswerving as in the ask-not-what era, in which the man who won World War II was succeeded by Mr. PT-109. If anything, Mr. Drury's imitators were even more idealistic than their model. Take Fletcher Knebel, the grandfather of the modern "political thriller." In "Seven Days in May" (1962), President Jordan Lyman's disarmament deal with the Russians arouses the ire of Gen. James Mattoon Scott, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who contrives a military coup with the assistance of the proto-fascist chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee -- but President Lyman saves the day. In "Night of Camp David" (1965), President Mark Hollenbach succumbs to delusions of grandeur -- but is gently eased out of office by a junta of Cabinet members and ranking elected officials before he can lob one into the men's room of the Kremlin. In "Vanished" (1968), President Paul Roudebush contrives to achieve worldwide nuclear disarmament and get re-elected, all in 407 pages.</p>
        <p>It wasn't just the novels, either. Theodore H. White's "Making of the President" series, the first of which was published in 1961, and William Manchester's "Death of a President" (1967), which is as much about the romance of Washington as the nightmare of Dallas, rode the same high tide of anxiety and optimism as "Advise and Consent," and were strikingly similar to it in texture and technique. The John F. Kennedy of "The Making of the President, 1960," a handsome lad of virtue all compact, is no less a fictional character than Senator Orrin Knox, the straight-talking, no-nonsense hero of "Advise and Consent," who saves the West without stooping to a single sordid compromise.</p>
        <p>It couldn't last, and it didn't. The decline of the Washington novel came in three installments. First was the Vietnam War, whose effects on Washingtonians were chronicled by Ward Just, a Washington and Saigon correspondent who resigned from the editorial board of The Washington Post in 1969 to write Hemingwayesque novels of power and disillusion, most of which received respectful reviews and comparatively few of which sold very well. Small wonder. Aside from the question of style, Mr. Just was ahead of his time: in the early 70's, readers of popular fiction were not quite ready to hear that their elected leaders were both immoral and boring. Then came Watergate, which knocked another prop out from under the world according to Allen Drury. How could a mere novelist contrive a plot, or a cast of characters, more bizarre than the one shown on the news each night?</p>
        <p>But it was the collapse of Communism that finally put paid to the traditional Washington novel. No longer in need of men on horseback to stave off the Evil Empire, Americans returned with an all but audible sigh of relief to their longstanding conviction that most politicians are crooks and louts at heart. Six years after the fall of the Berlin wall, the idea that one might make money idealizing any politician now seems lunatic at best. Why write 600-page novels about people like Bill Clinton? Better to let Rush Limbaugh slap them around between beer commercials.</p>
        <p>THE only Washington novel published recently that is at all Druryesque is Charles McCarry's "Shelley's Heart," and it is surely a sign of the times that Mr. McCarry's novel is less about personalities than ideology -- a cross, as it were, between "Advise and Consent" and "Atlas Shrugged." "Shelley's Heart" is a paranoid fantasy about the Shelley Society, a secret cabal of left-wing Yale alumni who seek to seize control of the United States Government by judicial skulduggery. Mr. McCarry pays brief and unconvincing homage to the innate goodness of elected officials ("Give 'em a chance and they'll behave like the Founding Fathers always told 'em to"), but his main interest is in chopping up lefties past and present: "They're in their final days -- a vanguard elite with a secret agenda who stopped being a popular movement a long time ago and have survived for half a century by lying to the people."</p>
        <p>"Shelley's Heart" has been selling briskly at Chapters, and is popular enough in Washington to have aroused the ire of Christopher Hitchens, who published a fulminant attack on Mr. McCarry in The New York Review of Books, in which Allen Drury and various other practitioners of the Washington novel also got their lumps. But I suspect few people outside the Beltway will get as worked up over Mr. McCarry's conservative politics -- much less the idea of a fictive bunch of pink Yalies who want to take over Washington. Most Americans would doubtless be glad to let them have it.</p>
        <p>For such folk, the essential Washington novel of the post-Reagan era will probably be William Safire's "Sleeper Spy" (Random House), a tale of derring-do in which a rumpled print reporter and a TV twinkie work their way through "all the attitudes in the 'Kama Sutra' of espionage." In "Sleeper Spy," the President of the United States makes his first entrance on page 163, and his final exit seven pages later. Talk about the end of an era. Orrin Knox would never have settled for a walk-on.  Terry Teachout is the editor of "A Second Mencken Chrestomathy." He is writing "H. L. Mencken: A Life."</p>
