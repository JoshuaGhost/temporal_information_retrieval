        <p>Gresham's law usually rules the world of children's films, where the dross so easily drives out the gold. So "A Little Princess," a dazzlingly beautiful screen adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's well-loved novel, didn't stand a chance against that friendly ghost. It all but vanished after a brief release, and ordinarily would have next surfaced at the video store. But this film is gorgeous enough to deserve the right theatrical setting, and now Warner Brothers is giving it a second chance. It reopens today in Manhattan at the Lincoln Square Theater, at Broadway and 68th Street.</p>
        <p>Unlike other films based on high-minded children's novels, this one isn't precious or prim. As directed so imaginatively by Alfonso Cuaron, a film maker about whom you can expect to hear much more, it revels in the rich visual possibilities presented by its far-reaching story. From India to the battlefields of World War I to a girls' school that would be just right for Madeleine, "A Little Princess" shows off an amazingly supple visual style. There's also a dash of magical realism, which keeps this film steadily surprising. Grown-ups won't get bored.</p>

        <p>What with all its hair ribbons and starched costumes, "A Little Princess" may find its most receptive audience in little girls. But for any young viewer, it's a nice break from the cartoonishness and platitudes that dominate children's fare this season. And as "A Little Princess" tells of Sarah Crewe (Liesel Matthews), the schoolgirl who is separated from her beloved father and forced to fend for herself in a private school -- as charmingly fanciful as the other sets here, and almost entirely green -- it does what today's usual children's film forgets to accomplish. It revives the art of storytelling and truly captures the imagination. JANET MASLIN  CRITIC'S CHOICE</p>
