        <p>Barbara Ricci, the winner of New York State's Mrs. Congeniality contest this year, was acquitted last week of having committed a most uncongenial act -- trying to run down her neighbor's 11-year-old daughter with a car.</p>
        <p>But the acquittal doesn't exactly make Mrs. Ricci the most agreeable woman in the state, as 24 of her fellow contestants judged her to be during the pageant.

        <p>But the acquittal doesn't exactly make Mrs. Ricci the most agreeable woman in the state, as 24 of her fellow contestants judged her to be during the pageant. In 1993, Mrs. Ricci pleaded guilty to a charge of harassment after being arrested for punching, kicking and pushing a police officer in Mount Vernon, where she lives.</p>
        <p>As for Mrs. Ricci's acquittal on charges that she tried to run over her neighbor's child, that came only after a second trial. The first trial in Mount Vernon City Court ended with a hung jury earlier this year.</p>
        <p>So what made the difference? According to David Hebert, a spokesman for the Westchester County District Attorney's office, "she took the stand in the first trial." The second time, Mrs. Congeniality kept mum. RAYMOND HERNANDEZ</p>
