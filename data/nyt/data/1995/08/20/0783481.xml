        <p>JUST 10 days after about 70 illegal immigrants from Thailand were freed from a prison-like California garment factory, where they had worked in virtual slavery, Federal labor officials notified more than a dozen large retailers last week that goods from the sweatshop may have ended up in their stores.</p>

        <p>JUST 10 days after about 70 illegal immigrants from Thailand were freed from a prison-like California garment factory, where they had worked in virtual slavery, Federal labor officials notified more than a dozen large retailers last week that goods from the sweatshop may have ended up in their stores.</p>
        <p>Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said the retailers had been asked to attend a meeting in Washington next month to discuss ways of preventing apparel made by slave labor from being sold in American stores. The invitation came amid a widening investigation of the garment shop in El Monte, Calif., and debate about the many other, more traditional sweatshops that still fail to pay minimum wage or overtime and often ignore health and safety laws.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Reich elaborated on what the Government, retailers and garment manufacturers can do to curb abusive labor practices. ALAN FINDER  Q. Do stores know from whom they have purchased apparel or under what conditions it has been been produced? A. The garment "food chain" is fairly complicated. Manufacturers often subcontract with cutting and sewing shops. The retailers contract with the manufacturers. Retailers increasingly specify what kinds of garments and the particular designs they need. Manufacturers using just-in-time inventory techniques deal with a whole set of subcontractors. It's often difficult for retailers to know precisely where a garment is cut or sewn. Q. Was the women's garment industry fragmented this way so manufacturers could avoid responsibility for working conditions in shops? Or were economic conditions behind the creation of these complex networks? A. We see the same pattern in many other industries. Increasingly, industries are fragmenting into networks of contractors and specialized subcontractors. The old model of a large, vertically integrated mass-production enterprise is becoming outmoded simply because consumers can now have goods tailored to their particular needs. Technology permits a wider array of enterprises to create niche markets and to supply one another with specialized services.  Q. Do you think consumers care whether clothing that they buy was made in a sweatshop or a factory that was abiding by all the labor laws? A. Undoubtedly consumers are interested first and foremost in price and quality. But most American consumers probably don't want to buy clothes made by slave laborers in the United States. Q. What can the Government do to make consumers more aware and force retailers and manufacturers to be more vigilant? A. The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 authorizes the Department of Labor to bar interstate shipments of goods made in violation of the act, such as in sweatshops. That power was used rarely in the past. But it has proved to be an important instrument to get an industry to take responsibility for preventing these kinds of abuses. By barring shipments or threatening to bar them, we've managed to make significant progress. The numbers of workers who have been identified as working in sweatshop conditions and whose employers have been fined has grown by 50 percent over the last 2 1/2 years.</p>
        <p>Now in this instance we traced the invoices to several national retail chains, Mays department stores and so on. There's no evidence that these retailers knew that the garments that they bought were cut and sewn by slave laborers in the United States, but I don't think it's too much to ask them to take greater responsibility for helping prevent these kinds of abuses in the future. Q. You're planning to meet with a number of these national retailers. What do you want them to do? A. Let me give you an example. In June, we got the agreement of many brand-name manufacturers operating in Los Angeles County, representing about a third of the garment industry in Los Angeles, to voluntarily audit their cutting and sewing contractors for compliance with labor laws. This was a direct result of our enforcement efforts. Obviously the manufacturers did not want to run the risk of having their shipments impounded. By the same token I would expect that retailers don't want to run the risk of not having their orders filled because the garments they ordered were produced by sweatshops.</p>
        <p>Retailers are also concerned about their public images. They want to be good corporate citizens, I assume. The national retailers and brand-name manufacturers working together can police this industry because they are directly in the food chain. Q. The number of Federal labor investigators declined by about 20 percent in the last six years. Do you have enough resources to crack down on sweatshops? A. No. We've done a great deal with relatively few resources, because we've enlisted the help of manufacturers and we've used the legal authority in the Fair Labor Standards Act, which had rarely been used before. But obviously the industry has got to start taking a greater responsibility. There are nearly one million employees in the industry who are cutting and sewing garments. Almost 80 percent are women. In Los Angeles County alone there are 100,000 cutters and sewers in 4,000 separate cutting and sewing shops. It's extremely difficult for Federal inspectors to root out sweatshops. Manufacturers, however, know whom they are contracting with. Retailers are able to follow the invoice trail and assert some pressure on manufacturers and their subcontractors.  Q. American manufacturers are often competing with foreign manufacturers who pay much lower labor rates. Is it reasonable to expect American companies to remain competitive, or should we consider abolishing laws like the minimum wage and allow the international marketplace to determine labor rates here? A. The garment industry in the United States is alive and well despite foreign competition. That's because there is an increasing demand for quick turnaround. Fashions change quickly, retailers want certain models, patterns, designs, immediately. It's often difficult for retailers to get the quick turnaround from foreign-sourced manufacturers.</p>
        <p>The amount of money we're talking about here, the difference between a sweatshop and a legitimate cutting and sewing operation, is relatively small considering the cost of the final garment. Remember, retailers are often marking up 60 to 100 percent. Q. Are you reasonably optimistic that the American garment industry will do a better job of policing itself? A.  The cutting and sewing end of the garment industry in the United States has had a sad history of worker abuses for more than a century. Immigrants, some of them legal, some illegal, crowded together in unsafe, unsanitary conditions working for very little money have characterized cutting and sewing shops since the turn of the century. Sometimes there's a calamity like the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in New York at the turn of the century, in which hundreds are killed. Laws are then enacted. But enforcement is always difficult.</p>
        <p>Unscrupulous employers and vulnerable workers in fly-by-night operations that can move from one location to another within days or hours make a difficult target for enforcement. The question is whether national brand-name manufacturers who contract with these small enterprises and large national retailers can have an impact. I'm cautiously optimistic.</p>
