        <p>The vats that once churned liquid sugar and flavor extracts into syrups of cola, sarsaparilla and cocoa cream sit empty at the Scholz Brothers soda factory on 18th Avenue. Carbon gas and water no longer rush through the pipes. The rickety bottling machines are silent.</p>
        <p>For more than 75 years, Scholz Brothers Beverages manufactured its own sodas and delivered them to homes all over northern Queens. It was an old-style operation founded by two German-Hungarian immigrant brothers in the pre-supermarket era of ice cream parlors and counter drug stores.</p>
        <p>But over the last six months, the second generation of Scholz soda-makers has given up soda-making. The company still delivers beverages made by others and its own siphon seltzer bottled in a separate machine. There are still bottling plants in Queens that sell wholesale (Coca Cola and Canada Dry are the largest), but the once-flourishing vat-to-doorstep soda business in Queens is no more.</p>
        <p>In its heyday, Scholz Brothers made more than 18 flavors of soda, delivered in cases of returnable bottles by six uniformed truck drivers. "In the 50's and 60's business was good," said Richard Scholz, 61, who owns the business with his brother Nicholas, 67. "There was no air-conditioning. People used to sit outside and wait for the soda truck to come."</p>
        <p>There were dozens of soda manufacturers who offered home delivery in Queens and Brooklyn in those days, Hammer, Hoffman, Arrow, Mission and Kirsch among them. Slowly, they have been squeezed out by the big-name brands that now dominate the industry.</p>
        <p>The Scholz brothers' father, Nicholas, had worked as a milkman and in a brewery before venturing into the soda business with his brother Peter in 1920.The second generation of Scholzes, who were born in College Point, began working in the plant as teen-agers in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>"We started bottling soda by hand," said Nicholas Scholz. "You had to fill the bottle washer by hand. Then you put the bottles in a semi-automatic filler that capped them. We labeled the bottles by hand, put them in boxes by hand and stacked the boxes by hand."</p>
        <p>Scholz Brothers also sold seltzer in siphon bottles. The company still bottles some siphon seltzer -- and sells Fox's U-Bet Chocolate syrup, used to make egg creams.</p>
        <p>Richard Scholz and his son, Richard Jr., 30, are all that remain of a work force that was once a dozen. Delivery routes have dropped from six to only one.</p>
        <p>"It's really sad," said Donna Hoffman, 33, whose family owns Cornell Beverages in Brooklyn, whose sodas Scholz Brothers is now delivering. "Richie Scholz has devoted his whole life to that business. Once you have bottling in your system, it's in your blood for life." DAVID M. HERSZENHORN AT A GLANCE Scholz Bros.
