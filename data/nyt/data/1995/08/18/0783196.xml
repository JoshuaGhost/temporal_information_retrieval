        <p>Perhaps listeners can be forgiven for merging Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields into a single persona. Since 1959, when Mr. Marriner founded the group, he and his ensemble have made hundreds of recordings that have become staples of classical radio. Still, a woman in the row behind me on Tuesday evening at Avery Fisher Hall took this identification to an unusual extreme. When her companion asked, "What orchestra is this?," she replied: "St. Marriner-in-the-Field. They're very well known."</p>
        <p>The very well known London ensemble and its knighted, if not quite sainted, conductor are currently making the rounds of American summer festivals, and they opened the final week of the Mostly Mozart Festival with two concerts devoted primarily to Beethoven. Of particular interest were the two pianists Mr. Marriner had in tow. Till Fellner, a 23-year-old Austrian, played Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 9 (K. 271) on Monday evening. And Imogen Cooper, a more firmly established English pianist best known to American listeners through her recordings (including some with Alfred Brendel), played the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 2 (Op. 19) on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>The very well known London ensemble and its knighted, if not quite sainted, conductor are currently making the rounds of American summer festivals, and they opened the final week of the Mostly Mozart Festival with two concerts devoted primarily to Beethoven. Of particular interest were the two pianists Mr. Marriner had in tow. Till Fellner, a 23-year-old Austrian, played Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 9 (K. 271) on Monday evening. And Imogen Cooper, a more firmly established English pianist best known to American listeners through her recordings (including some with Alfred Brendel), played the Beethoven Piano Concerto No. 2 (Op. 19) on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fellner's Mozart -- or at least, his early Mozart -- is very much in the current fashion, which is to say small in scale, transparent in texture and articulated with fastidious clarity. Except in the finale, which demands a brighter, more outgoing approach, his account was calmly reasoned and his coloration subtle. But this was evidently an incomplete glimpse of Mr. Fellner's interpretive personality. In a performance of the Beethoven Concerto No. 3 on Sunday afternoon at Tanglewood, he worked in broader, bolder strokes.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooper gave a driven account of the Beethoven Second, drawing energy from the contrary impulses that perpetually tugged at the young Beethoven, namely the need to be accepted as an urbane Viennese composer and the desire to break rules and draw on ruder impulses. In the outer movements, Ms. Cooper, with the full support of Mr. Marriner, gave the second impulse freer rein, stopping just short of recklessness in their brisk tempos and vivid balances. In the central Adagio, Ms. Cooper looked at the other Beethoven, playing with a heavenly smoothness and a gauzy tone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marriner also presided over Beethoven's "Leonore" Overture No. 3 and the Seventh Symphony, on Monday, and the First and Fifth Symphonies on Tuesday. The readings were hardly generic, although by the end of the first program, the hallmarks of Mr. Marriner's approach to Beethoven could be easily summarized. He seems to love the kettledrum, and he gave his timpanist, Tristan Fry, license to flail away at pivotal cadences and movement endings. He is also fond of internal brass and wind lines, and frequently tweaked the balances to let these sections ride over the strings.</p>
        <p>The result was an excitement that often seemed more manufactured than natural. When the timpany and winds were not in the spotlight, the playing was unobjectionable, perhaps even unimpeachable, and Mr. Marriner's generally perky tempos kept things moving. Yet for long stretches, the musicians seemed to be on autopilot, and a listener waited in vain for the drama that should enliven every bar of these works.  MUSIC REVIEW</p>
