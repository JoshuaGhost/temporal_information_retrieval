        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani certainly has a way with words. On Monday, he managed in a short speech about the public schools to alienate virtually the entire educational establishment. What did he say? That the public school system is near collapse and that a remake should be modeled on the city's Roman Catholic schools.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani is wrong about much of this. But he is also right. I share his high regard for parochial schools, having been educated at St. Augustine's in Brooklyn, once the rival to Bishop Loughlin High School, the Mayor's alma mater. Like him, I shared the sense of high expectations, strong community values and strict academic standards of the LaSalle Christian brothers. I wish every child here could have as good an experience.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani certainly has a way with words. On Monday, he managed in a short speech about the public schools to alienate virtually the entire educational establishment. What did he say? That the public school system is near collapse and that a remake should be modeled on the city's Roman Catholic schools.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani is wrong about much of this. But he is also right. I share his high regard for parochial schools, having been educated at St. Augustine's in Brooklyn, once the rival to Bishop Loughlin High School, the Mayor's alma mater. Like him, I shared the sense of high expectations, strong community values and strict academic standards of the LaSalle Christian brothers. I wish every child here could have as good an experience.</p>
        <p>But the Catholic schools do not have a monopoly on these qualities. There are plenty of public schools -- and non-Catholic parochial schools -- where talented, committed teachers work with students and parents to provide an excellent education. Many of these students come from the poorest neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>We do not have to look far to discover models for public education. These include LaGuardia High School, in Manhattan, where students excel in the performing arts; Midwood High School, in Brooklyn, which features a medical science program that has gotten graduates into top colleges, and A. Philip Randolph High School, in Manhattan, which offers medical science courses at City College.</p>
        <p>There are also outstanding non-traditional schools, like the Science Skills Center in Brooklyn and the Renaissance School, in Long Island City, which last year ranked first in the district in reading. The newly established Manhattan School for Children, in East Harlem, tries to involve poor parents in their children's education.</p>
        <p>These schools are examples of the reform the Mayor wants. Clearly, more could be done with support from the top. In large part, not that you'd know it from the Mayor's speech, these schools are the result of efforts by Chancellors Joseph Fernandez and Ramon Cortines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fernandez pushed for and Mr. Cortines has actively supported school-based management -- schools run by principals and teachers working closely with parents to develop programs tailored to communities' needs. School-based management unleashed a creative force that the Mayor should embrace. He would do more for school reform by acknowledging these efforts than by giving aid and comfort to those who would pit parochial schools against public schools.</p>
        <p>So how is the Mayor right? He's right in being angry and frustrated with the Board of Education. He's hardly alone. Most of the city's innovative educators share his frustration. The only way Deborah Meier and the others who created the city's special schools did so was by doing an end-run around bureaucrats at 110 Livingston Street.</p>
        <p>The Mayor is right in considering the board a major impediment to change. The board does not know how to manage school affairs. Instead of creating and nurturing successful schools, it insists on mindless adherence to irrelevant rules. It does not even know how many schools it runs, the number of employees or where they work. After 20 years of watching this system closely, I believe the board really doesn't care.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers saw this ineptitude when Mayor Giuliani asked for simple budget data and the board repeatedly gave him misinformation. Whether the issue is an asbestos crisis, a school safety problem or wholesale theft from the bureau of supplies, often the board is the last to know.</p>
        <p>But the Mayor is wrong to assume that the solution lies outside the public schools. It lies with the State Legislature, which should abolish the board. The Mayor, who is ultimately held accountable by the public, should have control over the schools, including the power to appoint a chancellor, answerable to him.</p>
        <p>If Gov. George Pataki and the Legislature do not act immediately to abolish the board, selfish grown-ups will have failed our children again. And too many others will join the Mayor in mistakenly thinking that the path to school success can only come from models imported into our public schools. If that happens, school reform will be set back years.  Frank J. Macchiarola, dean of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, was Schools Chancellor from 1978 to 1983.</p>
