        <p>Twelve starts into his major league career, Bill Pulsipher has some bad news for opposing hitters.</p>
        <p>"I feel like I'm more of a pitcher," the Mets' 21-year-old left-hander announced last night.</p>
        <p>That is because Pulsipher has added a changeup to his arsenal. That is because he is growing more and more confident with each start. And that is because he is no longer afraid to use the new pitch while behind in the count</p>
        <p>This could all be gleaned from last night's performance. Pulsipher (4-6) pitched eight shutout innings at Shea Stadium against the Montreal Expos to run his scoreless string to 15 innings. The Mets pieced together a run without hitting a ball out of the infield against a pitcher who is actually more quirky than Pulsipher, Montreal's Carlos Perez. And the Mets snapped a three-game losing streak with a 1-0 victory in which they hit two balls out of the infield all night (both pop-ups to short center field).</p>
        <p>Three infield hits? No problem.</p>
        <p>"Bill pitched as professional a game as you would want to see," said Manager Dallas Green. "You probably saw two of the better young left-handers in the league tonight. Both held up their end. We were able to squeeze a run out. They didn't. That was the difference in the game."</p>
        <p>That and the fact that Pulsipher was able to use his new-found changeup to his advantage. Afterward, the rookie was asked what was the most important lesson he has learned since he has been in the big leagues.</p>
        <p>"When you change speeds, you have a good chance to get hitters out," he said. "That was the most effective my changeup has been in the zone."</p>
        <p>In the minors, Pulsipher rarely threw the pitch. For one, he had no reason to, because his fastball was more than enough to get him by. For another, he had no confidence in the change.</p>
        <p>"I just didn't feel it was a quality enough pitch where I should use it," Pulsipher explained.</p>
        <p>Last night, he threw 11 changeups. His best buddy and roommate, Jason Isringhausen, threw 15 the night before. Pulsipher got to the majors because of his heat, Isringhausen because of the same thing, plus an unhittable knuckle curve. If they can master the change, they will become that much more dangerous to opposing hitters.</p>
        <p>Which is not to say that their changes are anything like that of last night's hard-luck loser. Chris Jones, who beat out an apparent double-play ball in the fourth to drive in the only run of the game, called Perez's pitch slower than a changeup.</p>
        <p>"I'm not even calling it a changeup," Jones said. "That was a straight eephus."</p>
        <p>Said Pulsipher: "He doesn't even throw his for a strike. They just swing at it. It's nasty. The bottom just falls out."</p>
        <p>Perez (10-5) struck out a career-high eight in seven innings, each accentuated with trademark swagger. Pulsipher allowed six hits and struck out only one in his eight. Still, it was Pulsipher who won the war.</p>
        <p>Now it's just a matter of getting his first complete-game shutout. After Green saw Pulsipher allow a one-out single in the eighth, then pitch his way out of the inning, he had seen enough. John Franco pitched the ninth and earned his 16th save. The Mets now have six shutouts in 1995, none a complete game.</p>
        <p>"I have complete confidence in myself to go out there and get the last three outs to close it out," Pulsipher said. "But I did my job. And John did his job. Dallas is the manager, I'm the player. And eight scoreless innings is better than giving up one in the ninth. Especially in a 1-0 ball game." INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>On the heels of PETE HARNISCH's upcoming surgery, the Mets received more bad news: The assistant general manager, GERRY HUNSICKER, said yesterday that a magnetic resonance imaging test of the rookie infielder EDGARDO ALFONZO had disclosed a herniated disk in his lower back. Alfonzo will see the back specialist Dr. FRANK CAMISSA in Manhattan today and will likely go on the disabled list. "We're going to wait and reserve judgment until he sees the specialist," said Hunsicker. "There are two ways you can go about it: laser surgery, which would not be a major deal, where there would be a two-month rehab period; or you could treat it conservatively, try to calm it down and have him try to play through it." DALLAS GREEN was not happy about the news. "I think he's done all we've asked of him and then more," Green said of Alfonzo. "He's played up to his capabilities and then some." Alfonzo, who has missed the last six games, is hitting .276. "Yeah, I'm worried about it," Alfonzo said. "I want to keep playing."</p>
        <p>Infielder AARON LEDESMA was optioned to Class AAA Norfolk. There is a good possibility that BUTCH HUSKEY (.288, 28 home runs, 87 runs batted in) will be called up from Norfolk to play third base in Alfonzo's place. . . . Hunsicker also announced that the Baltimore Orioles had selected the left-hander JIMMY WILLIAMS (11-4, 3.05 earned run average at Norfolk) as the player to be named in the BOBBY BONILLA deal. . . . RYAN THOMPSON (strained right hamstring) went 2 for 4 with 2 r.b.i. in his first rehab assignment at Class AA Binghamton. . . . The Mets-Expos game lasted 2 hours 7 minutes, the Mets' shortest of the season.</p>
