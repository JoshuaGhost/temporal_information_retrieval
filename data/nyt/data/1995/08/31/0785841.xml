        <p>JEFFREY MILSTEIN, owner of Paper House Productions in Woodstock, N.Y., is putting his training as an architect to work in his new designs for greeting cards (above right).</p>
        <p>They come in crisp geometric shapes and are printed with bold stripes and primary colors. The cards, called Fun Houses, come flat to fit into envelopes. Each folds into a four-inch-high, boxlike paper house with a peaked roof. Children especially should enjoy the peekaboo window on one side that reveals photographs of people and dogs inside.</p>
