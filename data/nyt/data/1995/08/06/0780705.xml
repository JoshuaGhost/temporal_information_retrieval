        <p>In June, an addict was shooting up behind a rose bush in the Ninth Street garden, a peaceful oasis in a decidedly unpeaceful neighborhood. Mary Owens, or Miss Mary, as she is known to virtually everyone on her block, Ninth Street between Avenues B and C, asked him to move on. "He told me he was busy," Ms. Owens said.</p>
        <p>The man, needle feeding a vein, used an expletive that angered Ms. Owens, a disciple of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who nevertheless has been known to wield an iron pipe. This time, she grabbed the needle. "I broke it off right in his arm," she said. "He screamed and ran off."</p>

        <p>In June, an addict was shooting up behind a rose bush in the Ninth Street garden, a peaceful oasis in a decidedly unpeaceful neighborhood. Mary Owens, or Miss Mary, as she is known to virtually everyone on her block, Ninth Street between Avenues B and C, asked him to move on. "He told me he was busy," Ms. Owens said.</p>
        <p>The man, needle feeding a vein, used an expletive that angered Ms. Owens, a disciple of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who nevertheless has been known to wield an iron pipe. This time, she grabbed the needle. "I broke it off right in his arm," she said. "He screamed and ran off."</p>
        <p>"I've seen him since," Ms. Owens added. "He tells his friends, 'Man, don't mess with that lady. She's crazy.' "</p>
        <p>Crazy is not an adjective most locals summon to describe Mary Owens, 56, the self-appointed guardian of this contentious corner of the East Village.</p>
        <p>To the "anarchists" she recently helped oust from La Plaza Cultural, a lot that has been the subject of an interminable tug-of-war involving anarchists, peddlers, the homeless and the city's Department of Housing and Urban Development, she can be a demon. "She's one mean old lady," offered a young woman sporting a crack-vial earring, after being forced out of La Plaza. To the neighborhood children she used to treat to trips to Orchard Beach and the Empire State Building until her asthma got so troublesome, she is a guardian angel.</p>
        <p>Like her or not, she is the Mayor of Ninth Street, her home for 33 years.</p>
        <p>And like most mayors, this native of Waycross, Ga., is opinionated and a tad frustrated. Not to mention short-tempered with community slackers. "They complain about everything," she said. "They pay lip service. They have every kind of point, except the needlepoint. Then when something good happens, they try to take credit, when they never got off their behinds."</p>
        <p>Ms. Owens's children are live in the South. Her husband, a Navy yeoman, died in 1959. Ms. Owens made her living as welder in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and later as a statistical analyst before asthma forced her early retirement.</p>
        <p>"We didn't have all these locks on our doors, these bars on our windows," she said. "In the 60's and early 70's, this neighborhood was like one big happy family. I think I'll give it maybe two more years, then move to North Carolina or Georgia." But as long as she's here, she added, "I'm not going to give up." M.W.
