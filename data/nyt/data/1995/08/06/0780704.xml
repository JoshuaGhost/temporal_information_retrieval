        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I cannot believe Norman Rose's "Churchill" is truly so wrongheaded as to deserve Henry Kissinger's vitriol. Instead, I assume Mr. Rose is merely a convenient foil for Mr. Kissinger's muse.</p>
        <p>But what a muse! First Mr. Kissinger skewers post-modern political leaders by observing that to Churchill, "the very concept of focus groups would have been unimaginable." Then he skewers post-modern nationalist historians by reciting that "it has become fashionable . . . to assert that . . . holding Britain together to fight alone against Nazi Germany" may have been "contrary to Britain's long-term interest." Finally, he immolates post-modern intellectual critics of his Edwardian ideal with the bon mot "They know everything. Unfortunately they don't know anything else."</p>
        <p>Churchill stopped Hitler. Germany's defeat ended the Holocaust. Whether cynic or hero, Churchill was a great man. At first blush, the violence of Mr. Kissinger's attack on Mr. Rose would suggest that despite such obvious facts, Mr. Kissinger nonetheless still fears for Church ill's reputation. Don't believe it. Believe instead that Mr. Kissinger has found a convenient platform from which he can blast away at entirely modern people and ideas. WILLIAM MCGRANE  San Francisco</p>
