        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your July 30 Road and Rail articles on the various projects under way to reduce commuting time between northern New Jersey communities and New York reveal the blatant bias in the allocation of public transportation funds in this state.</p>
        <p>While you detail more than $2.4 billion worth of these projects for those fortunate enough to live in the favored land north of Trenton, you do not mention that those of us who live in the rest of New Jersey have no public transportation beyond buses and the high-speed line that runs from Lindenwold to Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>Your July 30 Road and Rail articles on the various projects under way to reduce commuting time between northern New Jersey communities and New York reveal the blatant bias in the allocation of public transportation funds in this state.</p>
        <p>While you detail more than $2.4 billion worth of these projects for those fortunate enough to live in the favored land north of Trenton, you do not mention that those of us who live in the rest of New Jersey have no public transportation beyond buses and the high-speed line that runs from Lindenwold to Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>In the more than 20 years I have lived in New Jersey, the state has not spent a cent to expand or improve on public transportation in southern New Jersey -- except for the gamblers' express train from the Philadelphia airport to Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>During those 20 years, the only thing the state has had to say about expanding the high-speed line (or any other public transportation project) is "We can't afford it." But the state does have billions to spend so a commuter going from Dover to Manhattan will save 17 minutes.</p>
        <p>Nothing could better demonstrate New Jersey Transit's attitude toward the desperate public transportation needs of the southern part of the state. WILLIAM LUTZ Haddonfield</p>
