        <p>WHEN the Walt Disney Company finishes spending $34 million to restore the New Amsterdam Theater, at 214 West 42d Street, it will have an exquisite Art Nouveau theater, with silver-leafed vaulted ceilings, gilded doors and glazed-pottery railings in the muted greens and terra cottas of the era. The theater will be restored not only to its original design, but also to its original purpose -- live entertainment. The New Amsterdam was where the Ziegfeld Follies played, Eddie Cantor sang and Will Rogers did rope tricks. The theater, which seats 1,800, was designed in 1903 by Henry B. Herts and Hugh Tallant, also the architects of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Disney plans to reopen the theater in the spring of 1997.</p>
        <p>The New Amsterdam seems predestined for Disney: the dominant design motif is an enchanted forest. There are bas-relief rabbits, monkeys, pelicans and peacocks adorning the proscenium, walls and staircases. The green carpeting, with scattered leaves and flowers, is being rewoven. "Rabbits for Disney!" said Hugh Hardy, a partner in Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates, the Manhattan architects in charge of the restoration. "It couldn't be better for the nature king."</p>

        <p>Modern amenities will include access for the disabled and more bathrooms for men and women. "In 1903, it wasn't good form for women to go to the bathroom in public," Mr. Hardy said.  CURRENTS</p>
