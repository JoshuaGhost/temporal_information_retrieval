        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Slovakia Slips Backward" (editorial, Aug. 14) describes the rapidly deteriorating situation in that republic. It is symptomatic that all members of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's Government are former Communists, except for one, who was in charge of atheistic education during the Communist regime.</p>
        <p>They are guilty of creating an economic catastrophe and even more of forcing perhaps a quarter million of Slovakia's best and brightest -- scientists, scholars, artists, entertainers, musicians and journalists -- to leave their country and immigrate to the Czech Republic, where many of them show their disdain for Slovakia's system by trying to adapt to their new home as fast as possible and legally assuming Czech names.</p>
        <p>This brain drain will have disastrous effects on Slovakia's culture and on its future among European nations. OLGA S. HRUBY Exec. Director, Research Center for Religion &amp; Human Rights New York, Aug. 14, 1995</p>
