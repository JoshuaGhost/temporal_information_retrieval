        <p>The baseball labor negotiations that disappeared more than three months ago could come back soon. A management person close to the owners' negotiating committee said the committee hopes to resume talks "in some form" in 10 days to two weeks.</p>
        <p>That timetable in mind, the committee has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow in Dallas. Participating in the meeting will be Rob Manfred, who had been the owners' No. 2 labor lawyer but who will apparently become No. 1. He would replace Chuck O'Connor, his associate at the Washington firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius, who was dismissed by Bud Selig, the acting commissioner.</p>
