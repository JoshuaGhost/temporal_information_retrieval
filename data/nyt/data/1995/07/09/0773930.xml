        <p>Judge Dredd Sylvester Stallone, Armand Assante  Directed by Danny Cannon R 91 minutes</p>

        <p>VIOLENCE -- The carnage is nonstop, but it's of the video-game variety and therefore not so real or scary. SEX -- None. PROFANITY -- Not much. Some cursing breaks out in tense moments. FOOTNOTE -- The film is based on a British comic strip and is so unreal that most children over 10 won't take is seriously. For Which Children? AGES 3-7 -- Inappropriate; the film is too confusing, too violent and too scary. AGES 8-12 -- The furious action, wildly futuristic settings and comic-book style will appeal to many in this age group. Still, the violence should rule it out. AGEX 13 and up -- This is an R-rated movie aimed at the young, and many teen-agers will want to see it. PETER M. NICHOLS  TAKING THE CHILDREN</p>
