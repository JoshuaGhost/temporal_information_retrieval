        <p>Evidence of that most unlikely of national trends, the plummeting crime rate, arrived in New Jersey last week. The state's Uniform Crime Report for 1994, released on Thursday, contained numbers that should have every police chief from Wyckoff to Wildwood smiling.</p>
        <p>Crime fell less in New Jersey than in the Northeast as a whole in 1994, according to the report, which is issued anually by the State Police. But there were solid, across-the-board decreases in every major category of crime, in every type of community -- urban, suburban and rural.</p>
        <p>Even Newark and Camden, two cities that have come to symbolize the intractability of urban crime and poverty, showed modest declines over all, though violent crimes increased slightly in both places.</p>
        <p>The New York Times arranged a conference call between the Superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, Col. Carl Williams, and Karen Spinner, director of public education and policy for the New Jersey Association on Correction, a not-for-profit group interested in improving the state's criminal justice and correction systems, to talk about what the report means.</p>
        <p>Q.  Why is the crime rate falling?  WILLIAMS One of the reasons that crime is down is the aggressive approach against crime by all law enforcement agencies, local, state, county and Federal, working together as a team. Maybe five years ago the arrest would stop with the individual officer on the street. Now with all the various task forces and the communication they allow between the agencies, we're taking that arrest further than it was taken before and trying to apprehend the source.  SPINNER A higher level of police presence or activity will hold down certain kinds of crime. But also some of the preventive things that are being done, some of the recent emphasis on conflict resolution in the schools, those kinds of seeds planted with young people and even older folks can lead to a lessening of aggression and the need or the propensity to commit crime.  Q. Does putting more people in jail, as New Jersey is doing, tend to decrease crime?  SPINNER No. If you look at the last 15 years , we've at least quadrupled our prison population, and we don't see a corresponding decrease in the amount of crime. I don't think putting our resources there has made much difference. I think putting our resources on the front end -- prevention and enforcement -- has a more important impact.  WILLIAMS I take a different view. With those individuals who are career criminals, our ability to put them away for long periods of time does have an impact on the incidence of crime. Incarcerating people who need to be incarcerated and keeping them there does help our crime rate go down, and it sends a subtle message to those out there who are thinking about doing something similar. I think that's one of the aggressive aspects of this administration, with the "three strikes and you're in" bill.  SPINNER But the three-strikes bill was just signed, so you couldn't really attribute the decreasing crime to that.  WILLIAMS Three strikes has been talked about on the national level for a couple of years now, and it was just a matter of time before it was passed here in New Jersey. An individual contemplating doing something might think twice if they think that by the time they get around to their  [ third ]  conviction some law like three strikes might be in effect.  Q. Arrests for sex offenses are down 5 percent from last year. Do you think Megan's Law, even though it wasn't passed until the end of October, had any effect in 1994?  WILLIAMS I think it's too early to tell with Megan's Law exactly what impact it will have, but I think people are thinking twice before they do things.  SPINNER I would suspect that for situational sex offenders, those who find themselves in a situation where they were robbing someone and take the opportunity to abuse them sexually, Megan's Law may be a deterrent. But for compulsive sex offenders, I don't think Megan's Law has an impact.  Q. While violent crime is down, violent crimes committed with guns increased slightly, about half a percent. Should we tighten our gun laws again?  WILLIAMS I think the tightening has to be nationwide.  SPINNER I don't know what you do about guns except that you work with kids and help them understand how dangerous they are.  Q. Arrests of juveniles increased by 6percent in 1994. Are we getting a handle on juvenile crime, which has been such a focus of concern in the past couple of years?  WILLIAMS We're trying. The Governor and the Attorney General's commission  [ on juvenile justice ]  is starting to review the juvenile laws here in New Jersey, and most police departments are starting to put more emphasis on the problems they're having with juveniles.  SPINNER When you look at how few police departments have a significantly large juvenile unit, you realize that if you really want to be serious about dealing with kids you have to assign officers to them and train them to deal specifically with kids.  Q. How do you account for the 13 percent jump in drug arrests? More drug use or more aggressive policing, or both?  WILLIAMS I think it's a combination. Statistics show that the use of marijuana among our younger generation is starting to increase again, and we still have to be aggressive in our interdiction program.  Q. Does law enforcement in New Jersey need to change anything it's doing now?  WILLIAMS The only thing I would say as far as change is concerned is that we can't change back to the way it was before when we kind of disregarded teamwork and cooperation between all law-enforcement agencies.  SPINNER I'd like to see more resources devoted to kids. If we can interdict a child early on in his or her career, we might save ourselves a lot of aggravation down the line.  N.J.
