        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a seasoned traveler who has flown the Atlantic over 200 times, I should have known better than to believe an advertisement about an airline.</p>
        <p>I recently found myself in Florida and, needing to go on to New York, I deserted my usual carrier to try American Airlines. I purchased a first class ticket and, looking forward to almost three hours of flying luxury to the Big Apple, on May 9 at 1:45 P.M. I boarded Flight 945.</p>
        <p>The small first-class section -- walls, floors and leather seats -- was not just scruffy, but actually dirty. The seats were in an incredible state of disrepair; one was so badly misaligned that it was unusable; all were torn and had broken panels.</p>
        <p>The most momentous experience came soon after take-off when it was revealed that there would only be a beverage service and no food at all.  The reason given by the cabin crew was "the accountants must be cutting back again." I had paid $:500, $833 at the time, for a trip that "the accountants" felt did not require a luncheon or even a snack. ANTHONY BRANDON-BRAVO  London J. S. Brown, staff supervisor in the American Airlines executive office, responds: We are sorry Mr. Brandon-Bravo was disappointed by the lack of meal service. We provide food when the flying time is at least one and a half hours and the flight is during a mealtime. Much of what was previously served in nonmeal hours was not consumed and was thrown away on arrival. For a flight like Mr. Brandon-Bravo's, leaving Miami at 2 P.M. and arriving at La Guardia at 4:52 P.M., we believe a beverage service, accompanied by pretzels, cashews or pistachios, is wholly appropriate in first class. We do not agree that food should always be served in the first-class cabin, given the higher fare. The greatest cost component of a first-class fare is the additional space, not the food or drinks. As for the condition of the cabin, it is clear we did not meet our standards, and we have shared Mr. Bravo's comments with the responsible managers.</p>
