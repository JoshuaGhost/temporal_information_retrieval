        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a rock musician who has been a partner in a record company, I found the July 23 article "The Life and Times of a Young Rock Band" yet another example of how these bands defeat their own goals and objectives at the square one level.</p>
        <p>A simple study of rock music's commercial and social traditions reveals the golden rule missing from the "curriculum" accompanying the article: Know thy audience.</p>
        <p>Since the late 1950's, the lion's share of total American music sales has been accounted for by people 12 to 24 years of age, with better than 70 percent of that in the 12 to 17 age group. Club owners are always in the bar business, never the music business. Because the average minimum age requirement for the club is 21 and over, bands performing in these establishments automatically eliminate most of their potential customer base.</p>
        <p>History records that the Beatles played at church socials, community picnics and coffee houses. Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly and the Beach Boys played hayrides and high schools. Teen-age artists like New Kids on the Block and Tiffany played suburban shopping centers, malls and amusement parks.</p>
        <p>These venues may not be as sexy-seedy-glamorous as urban beer and dance halls, but they generate the necessary audience base. STANLEY GANS  Manhattan</p>
