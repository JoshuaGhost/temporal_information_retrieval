        <p>The adult tamarins, two males and two females, were born in Brazilian zoos and arrived last week at the Central Park Wildlife Center/Zoo, which is the first North American zoological park to join international conservation efforts to save this species.</p>

        <p>THOSE funny faces staring back at you in the Central Park Zoo's rain forest exhibit are the city's latest addition to its urban jungle: four black lion tamarin monkeys, among the world's rarest primates.</p>
        <p>The adult tamarins, two males and two females, were born in Brazilian zoos and arrived last week at the Central Park Wildlife Center/Zoo, which is the first North American zoological park to join international conservation efforts to save this species.</p>
        <p>But the zoo isn't taking all the credit.</p>
        <p>"It's more of a coup for the animals, in that there will be much more attention focused on their plight by North Americans, as well as South Americans," says Dr. Dan Wharton, the center's director. "I think of them as goodwill ambassadors for their own species."</p>
        <p>Black lion tamarins were thought to be extinct until they were rediscovered in the Atlantic Forest region of Brazil in 1970.</p>
        <p>They live in isolated pockets, and the largest estimate of the wild population is 450.</p>
        <p>The main threat to the monkeys is the loss of their treetop homes through the destruction of the rain forest in South America.</p>
        <p>Central Park Wildlife Center/Zoo, 64th Street and Fifth Avenue. Admission: $2.50; $1.25 for the elderly; children 3 to 12, 50 cents; children under 3, free. Monday through Friday, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; Saturday and Sunday, 10:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. Last ticket is sold a half-hour before closing. Information: (212) 861-6030.
