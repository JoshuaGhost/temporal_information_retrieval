        <p>If Cal Ripken Jr. has any class -- and we've been led to believe that Cal is one class act -- he will take a day off between now and Sept. 6 when he is expected to break Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 consecutive baseball games.</p>
        <p>Cal will simply sit one out.</p>
        <p>There will be shock at first; gratuitous goodness is a shock these days.</p>
        <p>There will probably be an attack, a snide questioning of his motivation; is there a sneaker deal in this, a CD-ROM?</p>
        <p>But Cal's Day Off will eventually be hailed as an act of conscience, the sports sacrifice of the 90's, perhaps the century. It will surely save the Game, perhaps even the republic for which it stands. Cal Ripken Jr. will be remembered forever as an athlete who stepped proudly over the statistical rubble of his sport to lead us all into a higher level of consciousness. He will end up a bigger Calvin than Klein.</p>
        <p>Cal Ripken Jr. has the power to make us rethink this entire business of records, these silly strings of numbers often set in different eras under different conditions. Why are they made to be broken? Why would anyone want to replace Lou Gehrig, our last clean hero, a pleasant, insecure, parsimonious, humble man who stepped out of the lineup only because he was dying. Remember that, please; Lou took a day off because he had a terminal disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, soon to be nicknamed for him, not because he had a groin pull, a hangover or a contract he wanted renegotiated. Cal would want to honor that.</p>
        <p>This is not a brand-new idea. Several years ago, Mike Schmidt, the Philadelphia third baseman who will be inducted today into the Hall of Fame, suggested that if Cal were truly "decent," he would tie the record, then take a day off. There would be no shame, implied Schmidt, in sharing a record with Gehrig.</p>
        <p>Gehrig's biographer, Ray Robinson, recounted in "Iron Horse" (Norton) how Eleanor Gehrig told Lou to quit at 1,999, a number that would be easier for fans to remember. But Gehrig soldiered on. He had ignored sciatica for years, played with broken bones and even the day after a beaning. He knew how easy it was to lose your job; he had taken over first base for the Yankees when Wally Pipp had a headache in 1925. He stayed in the lineup until early in 1939.</p>
        <p>Curiously enough, the author Robinson has come to root for Cal because he admires the Baltimore Oriole's charitable works and humble demeanor. Cal is about as close to Gehrig in ethic and style as players get these days. He has the rangy good looks of Gary Cooper, who played Lou in "Pride of the Yankees." Robinson also points out that Ripken has played more innings than Gehrig (Lou would come out late in games) and that shortstop is a more demanding and dangerous position than first base. He assumes runners will try not to spike Cal this summer.</p>
        <p>This is all big-hearted of Robinson, who was present at the Stadium in 1939 when Gehrig made his famous "luckiest man on the face of the earth" speech. But it is misplaced.</p>
        <p>We need both Gehrig and Ripken these days, we can't afford one replacing the other. Gehrig, after all, is the last major icon of the game who hasn't been brushed with revisionist slime. Ty Cobb was a psycho and Babe Ruth was a promiscuous pig and the memories of Mickey Mantle and Duke Snider are turning as yellow and curly as last week's tabloid newsprint.</p>
        <p>And Cal looks as clean as Lou, especially now as the Strawberry Fields bring their endless harvest of shame. This is not to pile all the blame on baseball; it's that only baseball, being the National Pastime and all, can save us. The moods are murkier in other sports. The emotional greed of fans blinds them to the right of basketball players, however rich and famous, to get a square deal. And football looms with more of its pseudo-masculine claptrap; will Chris Maumalanga of the Giants be able to channel his destructive inner rages toward hurting non-Giant players?</p>
        <p>Because Cal Ripken Jr. is a low-key kind of guy, his day off won't be a fancy show, no multimedia conference, no softball toss with Larry King or Diane Sawyer. Just a quiet, "Hey, Skip, I'm a tad under the weather today, I'll take a pass." And no one will find out until the lineups flash on the scoreboard. He will be remembered forever as someone who revered his sport and its history. His face will deserve to be on screen, on line, on cereal boxes.</p>
        <p>Robinson once asked Ripken if he had read his Gehrig biography, and the ballplayer promised to read it "when all this is over." He should read it on his day off. After that, he may never have a chance to read a book again as America celebrates two enduring heroes, the Iron Horse and the Golden Horse.  BACKTALK</p>
