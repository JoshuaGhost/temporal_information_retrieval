        <p>A fight involving 300 inmates, apparently over a stolen gold chain, erupted on Monday evening at the state prison in Gouverneur, N.Y., leaving about 13 injured, one seriously, officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The fight at the medium-security prison, about 25 miles from the Canadian border, pitted a group of black inmates against a group of Hispanic prisoners. But officials refused to characterize the upheaval as racial. James Flateau, a spokesman for the Department of Correctional Services, said the incident was still under investigation and would not comment on a possible cause.</p>
        <p>But a correction official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the fight may have been ignited when a black inmate tried to steal a gold chain from a Hispanic inmate. Mr. Flateau would not confirm or deny this explanation.</p>
        <p>He said the 890-inmate prison, while at capacity, was not overcrowded. Although the prison was over capacity several years ago, Mr. Flateau said the numbers had been brought down two years ago.</p>
        <p>By last night, all the inmates except those injured were back in their dormitories and were being fed in the mess.</p>
        <p>The fight began about 7:30 P.M. in the prison yard. The state police, called in to guard the edge of the prison, did not leave until 3 A.M. By then, one inmate had been critically injured by a blow to the head, Mr. Flateau said. His condition was upgraded to guarded yesterday, and a half-dozen of the injured remained hospitalized with cuts and fractures.</p>
        <p>Several guards suffered from inhaling a substance like tear gas, used to control the inmates, and two suffered minor injuries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flateau characterized the incident as isolated, "to the extent it was unrelated to anything happening at any other prison," he said.</p>
