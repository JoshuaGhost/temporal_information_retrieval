        <p>Her seemingly privileged childhood was not a fairy tale but a dark make-believe, the singer CARLY SIMON says in the current issue of Vanity Fair magazine. "There was no truth, because we were living this Tennessee Williams play," she says. "We were responding like an audience to a play, as opposed to living the lives of the characters. It was so convoluted it was unreal."</p>
        <p>Ms. Simon said that her mother, who died last year, had a long affair with a man hired to be the companion of the singer's brother, and that her father, the book publisher Richard L. Simon, had a long liaison with a woman 18 years his senior. Ms. Simon said this unsettled home life helped explain her stammer, stage fright, neuroses, obsession with sex, and success in music, The Associated Press reported.</p>

        <p>"I felt so strangulated talking that I did the natural thing, which is to write songs, because I could sing without stammering," she recalled.</p>
        <p>Ms. Simon said her relationship with her former husband, JAMES TAYLOR, was undermined because his faults reminded her of her father's.</p>
