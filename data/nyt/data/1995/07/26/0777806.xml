        <p>The House of Representatives today inaugurated a procedure to allow lawmakers to overturn unnecessary Government rules and proved that one politician's case of bureaucratic overkill is another's essential safeguard.</p>
        <p>On the first test of what Speaker Newt Gingrich calls Corrections Day, the House voted, 269 to 156, to give San Diego a permanent exemption from the Clean Water Act's requirement that the city thoroughly purify sewage before piping it deep into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p>As matter of substance, the vote had little meaning. The Environmental Protection Agency has already promised to give San Diego a five-year, renewable exemption from the law. In addition, the measure approved today is identical to a provision in amendments to the Clean Water Act that the House approved in May. And the Senate is unlikely to approve the legislation no matter how many times the House passes it.</p>
        <p>It was interesting nonetheless because of the novelty of the procedure and because of the way so many Democrats made it into a partisan issue. The arguments on both sides were hyperbolic.</p>
        <p>Representative Frank Pallone Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, declared, for example, that the bill represented "the beginning of the end" of enforcement of clean water standards.</p>
        <p>Representative Norman Y. Mineta, a Northern California Democrat, maintained that the bill would allow San Diego to do "substantially less treatment than it is doing today."</p>
        <p>Neither argument is supported by the evidence.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Representative Bud Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, called the situation in San Diego "a prime example of bureaucracy in Washington imposing multibillion-dollar costs on a city that are absolutely unnecessary."</p>
        <p>That statement is also unsupportable. San Diego had a longstanding dispute with the Environmental Protection Agency in the Reagan and Bush Administrations over whether it needed to purify sewage more before it dumped it into the ocean. But the Clinton Administration has promised San Diego it will not have to invest in a more advanced system of water treatment.</p>
        <p>As advertised by Mr. Gingrich, the second and fourth Tuesdays of each month are supposed to be Corrections Day. Measures to quash unnecessary regulations can be brought up under a fast-track procedure; approval requires a three-fifths majority.</p>
        <p>When the House approved the Corrections Day procedure last month, Mr. Gingrich said his intention was to use it for measures that were not controversial. But the 269 votes in favor of the bill today were only 14 more than the 60 percent needed.</p>
        <p>Forty-five Democrats joined 224 Republicans in favor of the bill; 5 Republicans, 150 Democrats and 1 independent voted against it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich said he chose the San Diego regulation for the first test of Corrections Day because the idea for the new procedure grew out of a conversation he had last January with the city's Mayor, Susan Golding. DAVID E. ROSENBAUM</p>
