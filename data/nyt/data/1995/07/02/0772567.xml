        <p>GROWING up in the 1960's in the Monroe Park section of Atlantic City, Karlos LaSane 2d was convinced he was going to be the among the greatest musicians of his era.</p>
        <p>His father, Karlos LaSane, was maitre d'hotel of Club Harlem, and father and son lived for the evenings -- the elder Mr. LaSane donning a tuxedo, the younger leaving his summer job picking trash off the Boardwalk to stand in his father's shadow, where he met musicians and entertainers, sat in on the shows, learned how to play trumpet, drums and bass guitar, and eventually sat in with a few Club Harlem bands.</p>

        <p>GROWING up in the 1960's in the Monroe Park section of Atlantic City, Karlos LaSane 2d was convinced he was going to be the among the greatest musicians of his era.</p>
        <p>His father, Karlos LaSane, was maitre d'hotel of Club Harlem, and father and son lived for the evenings -- the elder Mr. LaSane donning a tuxedo, the younger leaving his summer job picking trash off the Boardwalk to stand in his father's shadow, where he met musicians and entertainers, sat in on the shows, learned how to play trumpet, drums and bass guitar, and eventually sat in with a few Club Harlem bands.</p>
        <p>"I knew Sarah Vaughan through my father, and Baby Sanchez -- Sammy Davis's mother, who was a bartender at a nightclub on Kentucky Avenue," said Mr. LaSane, now 39. "I met George Benson before he ever opened his mouth. They had him in a lounge band at Club Harlem, in the front lounge, because nobody felt he was good enough for the big lounge in the back."</p>
        <p>The star-struck Mr. LaSane remembers asking Lionel Richie, then singing with the Commodores, what it took to be successful. "He said to me, 'You got to keep working.' He didn't have to tell me that."</p>
        <p>Now both Mr. Richie and Mr. LaSane spend most of their time in Atlantic City in the casinos, Mr. Richie as a showroom entertainer, Mr. LaSane as equal employment opportunity manager at the Claridge casino hotel. And though he had to give up the dream of becoming a great musician, he has found a way to combine his love of music with his nostalgia for a vanished time: he is impresario of Atlantic City's Kentucky Avenue Festival.</p>
        <p>The fourth annual festival will be held from noon to 8 P.M. next Saturday and Sunday, rain or shine. The festival will feature outdoor performances of jazz, rhythm-and-blues, rap and gospel by 30 groups, mostly local and regional, but including such headliners as the Ohio Players. The site is Kentucky Avenue between Atlantic and Arctic Avenues, and admission is free.</p>
        <p>The idea, Mr. LaSane says, is to restore some of the flavor of a time when "summer nights on Kentucky Avenue, man, they were electric." It will take some doing. Club Harlem, the avenue's greatest landmark, is now a parking lot. Some chairs, pictures and memorabilia from the club are on display in the small Kentucky Avenue Museum, opposite a shopping mall that is under construction. The museum, which traces the history of the clubs on the street and some of the performers, will be open during the festival.</p>
        <p>While casinos have experimented, and even specialized, in the more commercial forms of jazz and rhythm-and-blues, Mr. LaSane envisions an environment "where musicians can stretch out and not worry about playing their hits, so that the music itself can be the experience itself."</p>
        <p>RETURN ENGAGEMENT For the first time in years Atlantic City has a cause celebre that blows away the Fourth of July fireworks: New Jersey gaming authorities have given Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts, the green light to build a new casino on a 155-acre tract now occupied by the police rifle range, the city motor pool and the former municipal dump.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wynn used Michael Milken's junk bonds to finance and operate a highly profitable version of the Las Vegas Golden Nugget casino on the Boardwalk, and then sold his casino to Bally Manufacturing (it's now Bally's Grand) when regulatory complications thwarted his plans to build a second casino in the marina district.</p>
        <p>In Atlantic City and Las Vegas, Mr. Wynn's Barnumesque love of architectural dazzle, high-rolling bravado and bottom-line profits have made him the most successful casino entrepreneur in the world -- far more so than his rival Donald Trump. Like the state's obsequious eagerness to welcome back its prodigal son, Mr. Wynn's offer to build a half-billion-dollar casino, hotel, retail and theme park complex on the city's largest tract of undeveloped land says to one and all -- the state, the casino industry, the gamblers on which it feeds and the tourists who just want to gawk -- that there are still some surprises in store for the once and future Queen of Resorts.</p>
