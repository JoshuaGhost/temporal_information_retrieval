        <p>PATERSON needed Cindy Del Carmen Villalba.</p>
        <p>She talked up the old factory town as though it were a major tourist attraction, or should be. She proudly told the uninitiated about her adopted city's mix of cultures, its history in the labor movement, its claim to William Carlos Williams, a favorite poet.</p>
        <p>Of course she knew the problems: the crime, the poverty, the boarded-up buildings, the closed plants. In fact, she often told other students at Rutgers that she intended to help fix things here, someway, somehow, once she graduated.</p>
        <p>And even if Cindy wasn't so obviously proud and determined to help, Paterson still needed her. It needed her as an example. With Cindy, it could have said: See, we can't be so bad. We raised a real winner. The little 7-year-old girl who came from Colombia achieved the immigrant dream right here. Her parents found jobs in factories, and she became her high school valedictorian, an honors student at a demanding university, and everything else she wanted to be.</p>
        <p>Cindy hadn't decided yet, exactly, just what she wanted to be when she was shot in the chest as she sat with her best friend in a parked car on a city street. She would have been 21 years old Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Her family said she liked missionary work. At Mary Help of Christians Academy, an all-girls Catholic school in North Haledon, outside Paterson, she had been active in a religious charitable club. It didn't stop after graduation. She would come home from her Rutgers dorm in New Brunswick to teach catechism at her parish, St. John the Baptist Cathedral.</p>
        <p>SHE also liked Wall Street. She had a notion of combining entrepreneurship and charity. She told professors she wanted to develop business partnerships with Latin American countries to bring jobs to poor people both here and there.</p>
        <p>The police say her murder a week ago was a plain old botched robbery. She had been back from a seven-and-a-half-week Rutgers program in Limon, Costa Rica, just a few hours and had to talk about it with a friend.</p>
        <p>It was not a pleasure trip. She had taught conversational English to youngsters, lived in a poor neighborhood and taken a demanding course on Afro-Caribbean culture and history. But Cindy loved the experience and was full of stories. Neither she nor her friend noticed the three youths who approached them until it was too late to move. The youths pointed a .25-caliber handgun at them and demanded money.</p>
        <p>Cindy took an angry bullet for giving the would-be robbers the bad news that the women didn't have any cash.</p>
        <p>It seems that every time a young person dies, he or she is described as an honor student or a model youth. John McClure, who taught Cindy's class in Costa Rica, recalled hearing himself spout what sounded like cliches after Cindy's wake. She was special. Extraordinary. Full of potential. But in her case, he said, it was all true. Her pupils in Limon flocked to her. She was smart and happy and utterly unconceited, despite her many accomplishments.</p>
        <p>Paterson could take some small comfort in knowing that the police caught Cindy's alleged killers quickly. Less than 24 hours after the murder, they tracked a single thumb print found inside her friend's car to one suspect, Mesach Greene, 18, of Paterson. He had been fingerprinted in March under "Megan's Law" as a convicted sex offender. They found him at home at dawn Saturday with Corie Miller, 17, the alleged shooter. The two suspects told the police about a third, Tracey Tisdol, 19, who was already in custody on another warrant.</p>
        <p>FRIENDS at Rutgers have said they are organizing a letter-campaign in her honor, lobbying for gun control. Her high school is planning to name a scholarship after her. She had not only the school's highest grade point average, but also received its top honor, the Golden Scepter award, for attaining the noble ideals of beauty, truth and joy.</p>
        <p>Most recently, she had won a full scholarship for the Costa Rica program. She was the only student Rutgers College chose this year for the award, and one of only three students granted scholarships for the program from throughout the university.</p>
        <p>Cindy could have gone to Harvard but chose Rutgers, the house brand she realized would serve her just as well as the designer label, at a better price. And as a high achiever from a humble background, she knew whom to thank.</p>
        <p>In her high school yearbook, she told her mother and father, Ana and Guillermo, in Spanish, that while it didn't always seem it, she appreciated them. She would spend her whole life doing all she possibly could to prove that she appreciated them, "if not by words, then by actions."  OUR TOWNS</p>
