        <p>Film and video guides make fat books, but for true seat-of-the-pants movie browsing, nothing beats surfing the guides on CD-ROM.</p>
        <p>In three new CD-ROM editions of large guides, the searches lead in all directions. The 22,000 movies in Video Hound Multimedia, for example, can be searched by title, genre, cast, director, awards, screenwriter, year of release, rating and seven other classifications. As with other such guides, searches can be mixed and matched for cross-reference.</p>

        <p>Film and video guides make fat books, but for true seat-of-the-pants movie browsing, nothing beats surfing the guides on CD-ROM.</p>
        <p>In three new CD-ROM editions of large guides, the searches lead in all directions. The 22,000 movies in Video Hound Multimedia, for example, can be searched by title, genre, cast, director, awards, screenwriter, year of release, rating and seven other classifications. As with other such guides, searches can be mixed and matched for cross-reference.</p>
        <p>And like other guides, the Video Hound disk packs big numbers: 60,000 videos (not only movies, but also children's, television, music, how-to and fine-arts videos), the video credits of 46,000 individuals, 2,300 movie stills, 650 audio clips from films, 250 sound effects (call up "Lassie Come Home" and dogs start to bark and howl) and many other items. The disk, published by Visible Ink Press, is for Windows and is sold in software outlets and bookstores. The price is $39.95. Information: (800) 776-6265.</p>
        <p>Another new CD-ROM, the Blockbuster Video Guide to Movies and Video, has fewer titles (21,000) and search categories than Video Hound, but the disk connects to an on-line service, which for a fee of $3 each time it is used provides monthly updated lists of new videos. The disk, also for Windows, is available at Blockbuster stores and other software outlets. The price is $19.99.</p>
        <p>These and other CD-ROM guides are dressed up with lively graphics and sound, which make them markedly different from their drab printed counterparts. They are also loaded with reviews, critical ratings, thumbnail biographies and other parcels of information.</p>
        <p>For true film buffs, though, perhaps the most useful of the new CD-ROM's is the 1995 edition of The Motion Picture Guide, for Windows and Macintosh, just released by Cinebooks. This disk holds all 21 volumes of the printed Motion Picture Guide, an exhaustive record of 35,000 films made since 1927. This CD-ROM has none of the bells and whistles that enliven the Video Hound and Blockbuster disks, and it makes no mention of video availability. For depth of information, however, it proves an invaluable reference work.</p>
        <p>For example, on Sept. 12 "For Whom the Bell Tolls," Sam Wood's adaptation of the Ernest Hemingway novel, is to be released on video for the first time. Pure video guides don't mention the film, but in The Motion Picture Guide one finds, among other things, a 57-character cast list and a 1,000-word essay that summarizes and assesses the film and its production. Click on any of the characters, and lists of all his or her credits appear, ready to be searched (the 106 films of Akim Tamiroff, for instance). The price is $199.50. Information: (800) 246-3776. NEW VIDEO RELEASES Star Trek Generations  1994. Paramount. $97.52. Laser disk, $34.98. 117 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.</p>
        <p>David Carson's film unites the first two "Star Trek" television series for a kind of grand review. For perils, there are a mysterious electrical field and a mad scientist (Malcolm McDowell). But the major event is the alliance between the aging Captain Kirk (William Shatner) and the elegant Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart). It all seems a bit klunky compared with sleeker thrillers, but the object, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, is to move "equitably among the two series' regulars, giving each a bit of fan-pleasing shtick."  Vanya on 42d Street  1994. Columbia Tri-Star. $97.51. Laser disk, $39.95. 119 minutes. Closed captioned. PG. Release date: Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Andre Gregory's direction of Chekhov's play, as filmed by Louis Malle, is set in the cavernous old New Amsterdam Theater in Manhattan. With trappings kept simple, Mr. Gregory gets to essentials and Mr. Malle's camera peers deeply into the souls of Vanya (Wallace Shawn), Yelena (Julianne Moore) and Astrov (Larry Pine). This results in a psychodrama coaxed forth with illusory ease and "with a visual elegance that seems to isolate and purify its characters and their troubles" (Maslin).  Miami Rhapsody  1995. Hollywood. $96.51. Laser disk, $39.98. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: Tuesday.</p>
        <p>As it uncovers the sexual peccadilloes of a well-to-do Jewish family, David Frankel's film pays homage to Woody Allen but proceeds in a contemporary way that Allen movies do not. Gwyn Marcus (Sarah Jessica Parker) is shocked at the wayward behavior of her mother (Mia Farrow), who has an affair with a Cuban exile (Antonio Banderas). But then, her father (Paul Mazursky), brother (Kevin Pollack) and sister (Garla Gugino) have committed similar infidelities. While the movie has none of Mr. Allen's darkly comic musings, its "smooth, psychologically rich performances cohere in a way that makes the Marcuses seem like a real family" (Stephen Holden).  The Brady Bunch Movie  1995. Paramount. $97.51. Laser disk, $39.98. 88 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>"Brady Bunch" cultism may remain a phenomenon, but that's a weak reason for a movie derived from a 1970's television show that was dorky even in its prime. Here the squeaky-clean clan lands in the grungy 90's without the brains or wit to look anything but silly. Shelley Long (as Carol) and Gary Cole (Mike) stay in tune with the vacuousness of the material, as do the Brady children, in a film that "manages to be painless and pointless in equal measure" (Maslin). FROM YEARS PAST Gary Cooper Goes to Town And Some Faraway Places</p>
        <p>Gary Cooper's portrayal of Robert Jordan in "For Whom the Bell Tolls," to be released for the first time on videotape in September, was his second role in a screen adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel. The first was in the 1932 film "A Farewell to Arms" (Good Times, $19.98, 78 minutes). Here are some other Cooper films on tape.</p>
        <p>MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN. In this Frank Capra classic, a small-town galoot (Mr. Cooper) inherits $20 million and is shown the ways of the world by a big-city reporter (Jean Arthur). 1936. Columbia Tri-Star. $19.98. 115 minutes.</p>
        <p>THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER. A snake is charmed and torture is withstood as Cooper deals with an uprising in India. 1935. MCA/Universal. $14.98. 110 minutes.</p>
        <p>THE PRIDE OF THE YANKEES. Lou Gehrig (Cooper) progresses from student days at Columbia through the years on "Murderers'Row" and on to his tragic end. 1942. Fox. $19.98. 127 minutes.</p>
        <p>HIGH NOON. Do not forsake me, O my darlin.' In Fred Zinnemann's film, one of the greatest westerns ever made, a sheriff (Cooper) stands alone against a gang of gunslingers come to kill him on his wedding day. 1952. Republic. $19.98. 85 minutes.</p>
        <p>LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON. Billy Wilder directs Cooper as a Texas millionaire, Audrey Hepburn as the Parisian with whom the Texan falls in love and Maurice Chevalier as the private eye he hires to learn her true identity. 1957. Fox. $19.98. 130 minutes.</p>
