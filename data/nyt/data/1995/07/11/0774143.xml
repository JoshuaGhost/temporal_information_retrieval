        <p>Must be something in the genes: There's nothing surprising about the notion that at least one of Irving Berlin's descendants might go into show business, but it was not always inevitable for the one who did, his granddaughter MARY ELLIN LERNER. It just took a while.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lerner, 38, intended to be a jazz musician when she studied music, voice and theater at Tufts University, but she said that when she graduated in 1978, "I couldn't figure out exactly how to do that." She added, "I had also been an English major and could see a path into writing more clearly." So she veered off into Columbia Journalism School and then to writing jobs on Mademoiselle, Family Weekly and other magazines.</p>

        <p>Must be something in the genes: There's nothing surprising about the notion that at least one of Irving Berlin's descendants might go into show business, but it was not always inevitable for the one who did, his granddaughter MARY ELLIN LERNER. It just took a while.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lerner, 38, intended to be a jazz musician when she studied music, voice and theater at Tufts University, but she said that when she graduated in 1978, "I couldn't figure out exactly how to do that." She added, "I had also been an English major and could see a path into writing more clearly." So she veered off into Columbia Journalism School and then to writing jobs on Mademoiselle, Family Weekly and other magazines.</p>
        <p>"When I did a profile of Harry Connick Jr., I realized that I wanted to be Harry Connick, not just write about him," she said. "That was about the time that my grandfather died, and when people die there is the feeling you get that something is passed down." Berlin died in 1989 at age 101. Ms. Lerner began going to open-mike performances in Washington, to Irving Berlin commemorative events, and she put together a little jazz trio. Now, she is scheduled to do a cabaret show on Aug. 6 at the Cultural Center in Southampton, L.I., and four shows at the West End Cafe in Washington in October.</p>
        <p>She includes a generous sprinkling of Irving Berlin songs in her shows, though she says she does not do so from a sense of obligation. "I don't feel any special responsibility or burden," she said. "I just want to sing his work well and be as true to it as possible. He was a wonderful man, a great down-to-earth old grandpa."</p>
