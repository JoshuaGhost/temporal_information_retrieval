        <p>If 36 people board boat (a) at point (b) for a cruise in harbor (c), what is going on?</p>
        <p>JUDITH ENGEL, a mathematics teacher at the Bronx High School of Science, refrained from asking brain-teasers like that one yesterday. But she did take 36 friends and former students on a cruise around New York Harbor. They boarded the Amberjack V -- which Ms. Engel had rented for the day, complete with captain and crew -- at Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport.</p>
        <p>She said she organized the cruise to celebrate her friendship with the passengers she invited, former students from her 40 years at the school. "My interview was June 12, 1955," Ms. Engel said. She was better at numbers than names that day: she called the principal by the mathematics chairman's name, but she still got the job.</p>
        <p>Since then, she estimated, she has taught 5,000 students under five principals in three buildings. "Because of her, I was a dual major in math and English," said one of the passengers, Barbara Nixon of Wilton, Conn., a corporate treasurer who began her career, like Ms. Engel, as a math teacher. "There was an English teacher who scared the life out of us, but her classroom was relaxed and she was always willing to help you through a problem instead of saying, 'You should have known that.'
