        <p>NEW YORK MURDER RATE PLUNGES SHARPLY In an acceleration of a four-year trend, the murder rate in New York City has plunged sharply since January to the lowest level in 25 years, according to Police Department statistics. In the first 25 weeks of the year, murders have fallen by nearly a third, to 563 from 826 in the same period last year. If the trend holds through the rest of the year, 1995 will record the fewest slayings since 1970, when 1,117 people were killed.  [ Page 1. ] PRESBYTERIAN HOSPITAL SEEKS MERGER Convinced that it cannot survive on its own in a medical marketplace racked by budget cuts and dominated by managed care, Presbyterian Hospital, one of the city's premiere academic hospitals, is actively looking to merge with another medical center. Executives at Presbyterian, the hospital at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, have begun discussions with two other leading centers, the New York Hospital and New York University Hospital, and hope to cement a partnership within a year, said Dr. William Speck, President of Presbyterian.  [ 1. ] NEW YORK CITY  A SETBACK OVER SQUATTERS squatThe city suffered a minor setback in its efforts to evict squatters from two buildings it owns on East 13th Street, but it also suffered a major tongue-lashing from a Supreme Court judge for its handling of evictions from two other buildings in May.  [ 23. ] SCHOOL REPORT CALLED FLAWED A report contending that school food officials approved huge shipments of rancid food to cafeterias is as flimsy as a "house of cards" and contains a flawed analysis, said the school system's top food-service official, who was removed from his job because of the report.  [ 23. ] TEEN-AGERS TAKE A WILD RIDE IN A BUS Two teen-agers stole a 40-foot bus and went on a raucous joy ride through Harlem, the police said, smashing into cars and finally running the bus up against a subway entrance.  [ 23. ] VYING FOR A (REALLY BIG) CHESS GAME Two of the world's best chess players may battle for supremacy within the glass-enclosed observation deck of the World Trade Center in a match starting in early September.  [ 25. ] While the national job market showed signs of strength, employment figures for the New York-New Jersey region were largely stagnant.  [ 36. ] REGION  SEARCH FOR A MISSING ATHLETE Hundreds of police officers, lifeguards and volunteers waded into cold chest-deep water for up to two hours off a beach at Hammonasset State Park in Connecticut, searching for a 21-year-old mentally retarded athlete.  [ 24. ] D.M.V. OFFICES CRIPPLED ON LAST DAY The long and bitter fight over Gov. Christine Todd Whitman's plan to privatize motor vehicle offices continued to the last day of state operation, as disgruntled workers sabotaged computers at five offices and failed to show up in large numbers, leaving six other offices too understaffed to function, authorities said.
