        <p>As the former Yugoslavia began its descent toward war in the early 1990's, the pro-Government Serbian press played a crucial role in whipping up nationalist fervor and hatred of non-Serbs.</p>
        <p>Newspapers were full of vivid stories, many of them exaggerated and others completely false, recounting gruesome atrocities committed against Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia. Television news programs broadcast propaganda daily, never missing a chance to show a destroyed village, a sobbing widow or a distraught refugee.</p>
        <p>By adopting this bitter tone, the press was serving the political goals of the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, who secured his hold on power by portraying himself as a militant nationalist who would defend Serbs everywhere against oppression.</p>
        <p>But lately Mr. Milosevic has reversed his political course, adopting a mainstream, conciliatory tone. The press has followed suit.</p>
        <p>Not only does the Belgrade press no longer concentrate on real or imagined atrocities suffered by Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia, but the conflicts there have dropped almost completely out of the news.</p>
        <p>Even when there is a major battle in Bosnia, it is reported with only a few words at the end of news broadcasts or a short article buried inside newspapers.</p>
        <p>The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, who once dominated front pages here, has become a virtual nonperson.</p>
        <p>These changes reflect President Milosevic's break with Dr. Karadzic and his desire to portray himself as a peacemaker.</p>
        <p>The Serbian leader has embraced the five-nation peace plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina, which Dr. Karadzic has rejected, and orchestrated the release of United Nations hostages who were captured a month ago by Dr. Karadzic's forces.</p>
        <p>He is eager to appear responsible and reliable, hoping that he can persuade the United Nations to lift economic sanctions against Yugoslavia, which now comprises only Serbia and Montenegro, and welcome it back into the international community.</p>
        <p>It no longer serves President Milosevic's interests to whip up pan-Serbian fervor, so he has abandoned all talk of "Greater Serbia" and is urging people here to concentrate on their own problems rather than on those of their brethren on the far side of the Drina River.</p>
        <p>"Milosevic was never a nationalist," said Predrag Simic, director of a foreign policy research center in Belgrade. "He was only a politician surfing on the nationalist wave. That explains how he was able to change course so easily. He is telling the world, 'Karadzic is a lunatic. I'm the only reasonable and trustworthy guy around now.'</p>
        <p>"The change in the press has been dramatic. There is nothing about the war in Bosnia, and I've forgotten what Karadzic looks like. Muslims and Albanians are no longer presented as villains. Letters to the editor, which used to be just a flood of anger and hatred, now take a very calm tone and talk about how people have to learn to live together."</p>
        <p>Almost every day, stories are printed and broadcast here that reinforce the new official ideology.</p>
        <p>One day recently, for example, the pro-Government newspaper Politika published a feature about a Muslim forester in the Serbian town of Loznica. It reported, with obvious disapproval, that Serbs in the area had drawn up a petition for his removal.</p>
        <p>In the article, several villagers asserted that the forester was honest and industrious.</p>
        <p>"I am not interested in whether he is a Muslim or not," the director of a local lumber company was quoted as saying. "The important thing is that he is honest and a good worker."</p>
        <p>The article made no mention of the war in Bosnia, but it was an implicit slap at the Bosnian Serbs, for whom mistrust of Muslims is an article of faith.</p>
        <p>Recently, the principal evening newscast here presented a report on three university students who had won a prize for their computer expertise. Some viewers were amazed that when the students spoke, they did so with clear Albanian accents.</p>
        <p>Until recently, ethnic Albanians were demonized here for their supposed hatred of Serbs in the region of Kosovo in southern Serbia, where the Albanians make up 90 percent of the population. The fact that three of them could be presented on Belgrade television as model students reflected the media's new tone.</p>
        <p>Another beneficiary of this change is Emir Kosturica, the Yugoslav film director whose latest work recently won the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival.</p>
        <p>The film is called "Underground" in English, but the original title translates as "Once Upon a Time There Was a Country." It clearly reflects Mr. Kosturica's anti-nationalist feelings and his nostalgia for the days when various ethnic and religious groups lived together in Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, Mr. Kosturica's triumph might have been ignored here because his film rejects national chauvinism. But the premiere last month was attended by politicians as well as show business celebrities, and it received rapturous reviews in the local press.</p>
        <p>"Nationalism has gone out of style in Serbia," a foreign diplomat here said. "There is no talk of 'Greater Serbia' anymore. Of course, Milosevic's ability to make a 180-degree turn like this also means that if things go another way, he is quite capable of adopting nationalism again."</p>
