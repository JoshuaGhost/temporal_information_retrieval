        <p>The stiff gale off the mountain today was Meg Mallon. While most of her peers got lost in Broadmoor's tall weeds and monstrous greens, Mallon shot a course-record 66, grabbed a two-stroke lead after the third round of the United States Women's Open and stocked up on cold medicine.</p>
        <p>Her breathing is erratic, her cough is incessant and her nightly hours of sleep can be counted on one hand, but the Open would be in gridlock without her. Mallon's 54-hole total of five-under-par 205 is an Open record.</p>

        <p>The stiff gale off the mountain today was Meg Mallon. While most of her peers got lost in Broadmoor's tall weeds and monstrous greens, Mallon shot a course-record 66, grabbed a two-stroke lead after the third round of the United States Women's Open and stocked up on cold medicine.</p>
        <p>Her breathing is erratic, her cough is incessant and her nightly hours of sleep can be counted on one hand, but the Open would be in gridlock without her. Mallon's 54-hole total of five-under-par 205 is an Open record.</p>
        <p>"Think I'm getting any sympathy right now?" Mallon asked.</p>
        <p>At tee-off this morning there was an eight-way tie for first place, at two under par. But by dusk, only three players remained below par. Humility may come in bunches, but, heading into Sunday's final round, the foursome to watch is the streaky Mallon, a late bloomer from New York named Julie Larsen, Rosie Jones and Kelly Robbins.</p>
        <p>Assuming Mallon figures out how to work her alarm clock -- she inadvertently set it on Eastern time Thursday night and was jarred awake at 4 A.M. -- the rest of the field may watch her from the rear Sunday. A notorious streak shooter, Mallon won the 1991 Open and LPGA Championship within a span of three weeks, and Laura Davies today practically anointed her the 1995 champion.</p>
        <p>"I'm not so sure," said Robbins, who shot a sizzling 68 today and is still five strokes back. "If you're anywhere within six or seven shots of the lead, you have a chance. Maybe Meg will fall in a hole.</p>
        <p>"Don't tell her I said that."</p>
        <p>If not for a noisy gallery, Robbins, this year's winner of the LPGA Championship, could be right on Mallon's heels. She was on pace for a 66 herself heading into the final hole, but just as she was putting from the 18th fringe, a man dropped a heavy water bottle.</p>
        <p>She flinched, shoved her shot too fiercely past the pin and had to two-putt just for a double bogey. Otherwise, she would have been only three strokes back.</p>
        <p>Asked if she heard the water bottle crash, Robbins said: "Yeah, but so what? The person's got to feel bad enough. People were yelling at him and everything."</p>
        <p>As a result, the golfer closest to Mallon -- at three under par -- is Larsen, who took her first golf lesson in her late teens, didn't join the tour until she was 29 and has a New York country club to thank.</p>
        <p>"When I was 16, my mom signed me up for golf lessons," she said. "And, as everyone knows, it hooks you."</p>
        <p>At the time, she was attending John Jay High School in Cross River, and her mother dropped her off that day at Waccabuc Country Club, near the New York-Connecticut border.</p>
        <p>"We were hitting some balls, and the pro said, 'How long you been playing?' " Larsen said. "I said, 'This is the first,' and he said, 'You've got to be kidding.' "</p>
        <p>Her strokes, according to some analysts, are home grown and not particularly textbook style, but she just won her first tournament in Minnesota a month ago and is now a birdie waiting to happen.</p>
        <p>Behind Larsen, at one under, is Jones, whose short game is exquisite. Jones has almost wrecked her neck twisting to locate the Cheyenne Mountains here, but that's exactly her trick for conquering these mammoth, sloping greens.</p>
        <p>"Putting here is a lot of imagination," Jones said.</p>
        <p>To be exact, all putts break away from the mountains, which is why every golfer wants to hit her approach shots below, not above, the pin. "You're not seeing these breaks on the green, you're feeling them with your feet as you walk up," Jones said.</p>
        <p>Some have a better feel than others. For instance, three women continued their collapse today, including the six-months-pregnant Dawn Coe-Jones of Canada, the 16-year-old Korean phenom Grace Park and the New York native Jean Bartholomew.</p>
        <p>Coe-Jones finally exhausted herself today. She was the co-leader after two rounds, but shot a four-over 74 and fell seven shots back. Another co-leader, Bartholomew, who traveled all over Europe and Japan before qualifying here on a lark, was the leader by herself when the rain-delayed second round was continued at daybreak today. But she shot a seven-over-par third round and is 10 shots back.</p>
        <p>As for Park, she has followed her opening-round 69 with consecutive 78's, and is already missing her high school friends. She is 20 strokes back.</p>
        <p>Mallon will hit the medicine cabinet again tonight. She's glad she gets to sleep in, but won't be the only nervous one Sunday.</p>
        <p>"You're going to have butterflies," Larsen said. "You've just got to get them to fly in formation."  GOLF</p>
