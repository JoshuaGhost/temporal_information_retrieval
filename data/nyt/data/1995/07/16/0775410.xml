        <p>ONE HOT SUMMER DAY. Written and photographed by Nina Crews. Greenwillow. $15. (Ages 2 and up) An enchanting little girl tells us just how hot it is, and photomontage illustrations show us her urban neighborhood and incidents from her very ordinary and very happy day -- eating two grape Popsicles, trying to fry an egg on the sidewalk, dancing and splashing when the rain comes.  THE MYSTERY OF THE ANCIENT MAYA: Revised Edition. By Carolyn Meyer and Charles Gallenkamp. Margaret K. McElderry. $15. (Ages 12 and up) Archeologists have unearthed and understood so much about the Mayas in the past decade, especially their writing, that the authors have completely revised their earlier book. The exciting science, good history and fine introduction serve adult readers, too.  CROCODILE GENE AND HIS FRIENDS. By Eduard Uspensky. Translated by Nina Ignatowicz. Illustrated by Vladimir Shpitalnik. Knopf. $15. (Ages 8 to 12) This classical-style story about friendship between curious animals and children was actually written in Russia 25 years ago. Although the political situation implicitly satirized (one creature lives in a telephone booth for privacy) has changed somewhat, the story remains charming.  BAM BAM BAM. By Eve Merriam. Illustrated by Dan Yaccarino. Bill Martin/Holt. $14.95. (Ages 2 to 5) A 1966 poem about the demolition that precedes the construction of a skyscraper has been exuberantly reillustrated.  LET'S BE FRIENDS. By Caroline Ness. Illustrated by Alex Ayliffe. Harper Festival. $5.95. (Ages 2 to 5) Zack is a black-and-white cat, Lucy a ginger-and-white puppy. They are both adorable, and after proper tussling they do make friends. Sweet.  THE EAGLE KITE. By Paula Fox. Richard Jackson/Orchard. $14.95. (Ages 11 to 14) Liam had known about his father's male lover for three years before being told about his father's AIDS, but he has not let himself understand. In this affecting novel, he comes to terms with denial and with grief.</p>
