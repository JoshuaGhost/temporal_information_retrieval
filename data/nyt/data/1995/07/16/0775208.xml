        <p>The Russian economy has come a long way in a short time. Not quite four years since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Russia has a market economy.</p>
        <p>It is rough, inequitable and weak. Many Russians, particularly the elderly trapped with fixed pensions from the Soviet era, have fallen into humiliating poverty. The disparity in living standards, egregious but shielded under Communism, is now much worse and painfully visible to everyone. The Government's role is still considerable. But given the calcified state of the Soviet economy, and the crippling grip of the Kremlin's central planners, the transformation has been remarkable.</p>
        <p>A new book by Anders Aslund -- a Swedish economist who teamed up with Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard to help Moscow design market reforms -- documents how far the economy has come. Russia has ended almost all price controls. It has ended most business subsidies and credits. Government no longer tells factories how many ball bearings to use or how much steel to produce. Indeed, more than 60 percent of the Russian work force is privately employed.</p>
        <p>Like democracy in Russia, a Russian market economy could still be stalled or even derailed. But the Government pledged recently to stabilize the value of the ruble on international currency markets, a pledge backed up by $10 billion of foreign reserves. That only makes sense if Moscow commits itself to keep responsible fiscal and monetary policies in place.</p>
        <p>The Yeltsin Government has made costly mistakes along the way. It prolonged agony by propping up bankrupt factories. It turned the central bank over to an incompetent bureaucrat who let go of the money supply and brought the economy to the verge of hyperinflation, with prices rising more than 2,000 percent in 1992. It preserved import subsidies and export controls that fed Government corruption.</p>
        <p>Russian living standards did sink, perhaps by between 10 and 20 percent. But Mr. Yeltsin and his aides, though vacillating at times, stayed with the market reforms. The Russian people, while demoralized by the initial shortages of food and consumer goods and rising unemployment, have not rebelled.</p>
        <p>Today some economic signs are encouraging. The central bank has changed hands and inflation is down to around 6 percent a month, above target but still a major improvement. The Parliament seems prepared to live up to agreements with the International Monetary Fund to keep Government deficits under control. A middle class is slowly developing. If monetary and fiscal restraint continues, the decision to fix the value of the ruble could produce significant dividends by giving foreign investors the confidence to invest in Russia.</p>
        <p>To sustain the momentum in the months ahead, Moscow must resist the temptation of opening the spigot to Government subsidies for politically powerful factory managers, a move that would threaten economic stability. The central bank must keep a tight lid on the money supply. The Government must tackle corruption.</p>
        <p>When President Yeltsin went to the hospital last week with heart problems, political speculation in Moscow was intense, but there was a fair degree of confidence that a constitutional succession would go forward if he were incapacitated. That faith in Russia's democratic institutions might also be applied to its economy, which is more than the reformers could have hoped when they set out to refashion Russia four years ago.</p>
