        <p>International A2-10  FRANCE PRESSES U.S. ON BOSNIA  France said it would pull its peacekeepers out of Bosnia unless the United States and Britain would commit their forces to save remaining "safe areas," after the Serbs overran one of them. A1  REFUGEE TALES OF HORROR  Thousands of Bosnian Muslim refugees from the area overrun by the Bosnian Serbs arrived in another area protected by the United Nations telling stories of killings, rapes and other atrocities. A1  U.S. SCRAMBLES FOR SOLUTION  The Clinton Administration searched feverishly for a way to salvage to the United Nations peacekeeping effort, trying to avoid sending American troops to assist in a dangerous withdrawal. A1  NEW THREAT FROM SERBS  Bosnian Serbs moved on a second United Nations "safe area," telling peacekeepers there that they should prepare to leave and saying they were going after a third United Nations enclave as well. A8  BURMESE TRANSITION SEEN  The Burmese opposition leader just freed after six years of house arrest spoke in an interview of shared power in a transitional government, though making it clear she seeks a civilian democracy. A6  FRAMING RUSSIAN HISTORY  A photographer who recorded the horrifying events of the Soviet empire, Russia's greatest combat photographer, is a survivor, but he has never profited from his work, and lives on a small pension. A3  Thousands of civilians fled Sri Lanka fighting. A6  An American died in the running of the bulls in Spain. A2  South Korea said many more are missing in its store collapse. A3  Paris Journal: But in the summer, it is not so nice.  A4  National A12-20  VOTE TO DROP ARTS MONEY  House Republican leaders agreed to cut off all Federal money to the National Endowment for the Arts within two years, a year earlier than they had planned.  A1  VOTING RIGHTS STILL UNCLEAR  The Supreme Court has issued dozens of decisions on the Voting Rights Act. Yet the law of voting rights remains part of the Court's unfinished business.  A1  A NEW TYPE OF MATTER  By chilling a cloud of atoms, scientists have created a type of matter that had eluded experimenters ever since its potential existence was postulated by Albert Einstein.  A1  A SETBACK FOR SIMPSON  Judge Lance Ito barred lawyers from O.J. Simpson from advancing their theory that Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were killed by drug dealers.  A12  MUCH WRANGLING IN CAPITAL  While Washington's new financial control board discussed future budgets, the city's Mayor and a leading House Republican argued over the current budget.  A12  SHUTTLE DEPLOYS SATELLITE  The space shuttle Discovery began its belated mission to deploy a communications satellite, five weeks after a delay caused by birds.  A15  PERIL SEEN IN BLOOD SUPPLY  A report said new steps were needed to prevent the spread of dangerous infectious agents because the ability of blood banks and public health systems to detect unknown microbes was weak. A15  PUSH FOR H.I.V. TESTING  Leaders of the House Commerce Committee said they had agreed to draft legislation to require testing of newborns for H.I.V. unless their mothers were tested.  A15  BASE CLOSINGS APPROVED  The President gave a grudging go-ahead to closing or consolidating 105 military bases.  A16  NICOTINE STEPS ARE BACKED  The White House indicated that it generally supports a proposal by the Food and Drug Administration to declare nicotine a drug.
