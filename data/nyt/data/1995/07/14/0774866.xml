        <p>The syndicated financial radio talk-show host Sonny Bloch pleaded not guilty yesterday to tax fraud and perjury charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloch, 58, was represented by a Federal defender at a one-minute appearance in Manhattan before a Federal magistrate. On May 25, a judge froze the assets of Mr. Bloch and his wife.</p>
        <p>The defendant, whose show was broadcast six days a week for 15 years, faces civil and criminal charges in several separate cases. His plea yesterday was to an eight-count indictment last week accusing him of evading taxes on more than $700,000 of income in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>It also charged that he had caused his broadcasting company to file false corporate tax returns and that he lied to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The charges carry maximum prison terms of five years.</p>
        <p>Federal conspiracy and fraud charges filed in Newark last month accuse Mr. Bloch of misleading investors, who spent nearly $21 million on questionable radio and wireless-cable ventures.</p>
        <p>He also faces a civil suit from 280 investors from 33 states.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS</p>
