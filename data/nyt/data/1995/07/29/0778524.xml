        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Nearly everyone has criticized the United Nations peacekeeping performance in Bosnia. But there has been remarkably little attention paid to the organization's humanitarian role. Few commentators seem to know that a number of United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Children's Fund, have been providing food, water, essential medicines and clothing to the many thousands of terrified and distraught women and children caught in this savage civil war. Unicef has sent teams of trauma experts to work with children in the refugee camps in Tuzla and other areas. They've also been helping to carry out a rapid immunization program for refugee children against measles, polio, diphtheria and tuberculosis.</p>

        <p>Nearly everyone has criticized the United Nations peacekeeping performance in Bosnia. But there has been remarkably little attention paid to the organization's humanitarian role. Few commentators seem to know that a number of United Nations agencies, including the United Nations Children's Fund, have been providing food, water, essential medicines and clothing to the many thousands of terrified and distraught women and children caught in this savage civil war. Unicef has sent teams of trauma experts to work with children in the refugee camps in Tuzla and other areas. They've also been helping to carry out a rapid immunization program for refugee children against measles, polio, diphtheria and tuberculosis.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, more than 20,000 children have been killed in Bosnia alone since war broke out. The cruelty displayed by all the combatants, the blatant disregard for human rights, the contempt for women and children have been a shock.</p>
        <p>But we would do well to remind ourselves that this time, at least, there is a United Nations and a United Nations Children's Fund that cares for human life, that is committed to every young child who must face the hatred seething through the cracks of their broken homes. GWENDOLYN CALVERT BAKER  President &amp; Chief Executive Officer U.S. Committee for Unicef New York, July 25, 1995</p>
