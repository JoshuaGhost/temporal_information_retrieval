        <p>For a week before he died, officials say Barry Jacobs, who was mentally and physically handicapped, lay on his living room couch without food or water, unable to help himself as his parents lay dead in the same room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs and his parents were found dead on Tuesday at the Hastings Village condominiums after neighbors complained of a foul odor from their one-bedroom apartment.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, an assistant Bergen County prosecutor, Sharyn Peiffer, said it appeared that Barry Jacobs, 38, died 24 to 48 hours before the Rutherford police climbed through a window of the locked apartment and discovered the gruesome scene.</p>
        <p>Ms. Peiffer said Abraham Jacobs, 70, and his wife, Shirley, thought to be in her 70's, appear to have died of heart attacks 7 to 10 days before their bodies were found.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs, who was thought to have had cerebral palsy from birth, had depended on his parents to feed and move him. Prosecutors said their deaths left him stranded on the couch, unable to reach a telephone less than 10 feet away.</p>
        <p>"The worst thing is the boy, laying there, not being able to help himself," said the acting Bergen County prosecutor, Charles R. Buckley.</p>
        <p>Ms. Peiffer said the son was also unable to take medication to control seizures, although it was not known whether that had anything to do with his death.</p>
        <p>"The preliminary indications are that he probably died as a result of not receiving food or water," Ms. Peiffer said. Prosecutors said there was no sign of forced entry. While the results of toxicology tests will not be known for six weeks, the county medical examiner, Sunandan B. Singh, has ruled that the deaths were from natural causes.</p>
        <p>Police officers who entered the apartment found Abraham Jacobs slumped in a recliner next to the couch where his son lay. Shirley Jacobs was found on the floor nearby.</p>
        <p>"In layman's terms, they died of natural causes," Ms. Peiffer said. "Heat cannot be ruled out as precipitating the heart attacks that we believe the couple suffered."</p>
        <p>Ms. Peiffer said an air-conditioner was on the fan setting. The temperature inside was 96 degrees when the bodies were discovered.</p>
