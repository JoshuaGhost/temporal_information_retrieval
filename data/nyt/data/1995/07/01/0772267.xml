        <p>Rebuffing broadcasters and civil liberties groups, a sharply divided Federal appeals court today upheld regulations that prohibit radio and television stations from carrying sexually oriented "indecent" programs between 6 A.M. and 10 P.M.</p>
        <p>The 7-to-4 decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit essentially preserves restrictions that Congress imposed in 1993. The court emphatically rejected arguments by broadcasters that the restrictions were too broad and said the Government had a "compelling interest" in shielding children from steamy programs beamed over the airwaves.</p>
        <p>"It is fanciful to believe that the vast majority of parents who wish to shield their children from indecent material can effectively do so without meaningful restrictions on the airwaves," said the opinion, written by Judge James L. Buckley.</p>
        <p>The decision is a turning point in a tortuous eight-year legal battle over steps by Congress and the Federal Communications Commission to clamp down on steamy programming. Twice, the same appellate court has rejected efforts to expand earlier restrictions, saying the proposed expansions were too broad to be constitutional.</p>
        <p>Today's ruling comes at a time when Congress has aggressively sought to impose new restrictions on sexual material over television and computer networks, and when Presidential candidates like Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the majority leader, are making attacks on such material a prominent part of their campaigns.</p>
        <p>The court itself split along political lines. All seven Republican appointees supported the rules; all four Democratic appointees issued lengthy dissents.</p>
        <p>The plaintiffs are virtually certain to appeal to the Supreme Court. The suit was brought by broadcasters and an alliance of civil liberties groups, led by Action for Children's Television, a nonprofit organization.</p>
        <p>The ruling today, by a full panel of the court, will bring little immediate change to what people see or hear over radio and television, and it does not apply at all to cable television. But it is likely to lead to tighter restrictions, because the court left the Government ample room to expand the prohibition to midnight from 10 P.M. As a result, media experts said today, the decision could affect shows like ABC's hit series "NYPD Blue," which is usually broadcast at 10 P.M. and periodically contains profane language and nudity.</p>
        <p>"Parents and the public are the winners," said Reed E. Hundt, the F.C.C. chairman, after today's decision was released. "The court's action serves the goal of confining this material to the hours when minors are less likely to be exposed."</p>
        <p>Broadcasters and other opponents of restrictions on indecency called the decision a major defeat.</p>
        <p>"It's very disappointing," said Timothy Dyk, a Washington lawyer who represented the major television networks and argued the case, "and it is a sharp departure from the approach reflected in earlier court decisions."</p>
        <p>Peggy Charren, head of Action for Children's Television, said the decision was chilling. "Too often, we try to protect children by doing in free speech," Ms. Charren said. "Indecency to some people might be sex education, and that's the problem.</p>
        <p>"Who defines indecency? The censors define it."</p>
        <p>Federal restrictions on "indecency" over television and radio have been a quagmire for policy makers. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled that the Government had a right to restrict indecency in broadcasting, and initial definitions were largely couched in terms of the famous "seven dirty words" described by the comedian George Carlin.</p>
        <p>"Indecent" programming has been broadly defined by the courts as "patently offensive" language or material that depicts "sexual or excretory activities or organs." The courts have said that indecency is milder than obscenity and pornography, which entail graphic pictures or descriptions of sex that are not protected by constitutional guarantees of free speech.</p>
        <p>In 1987 the F.C.C. moved to expand enforcement against indecency to cover material that might not contain the "seven dirty words" but nonetheless described sexual topics in a "patently offensive way."</p>
        <p>Two years later, the appeals court here rejected that approach, ordering the commission to provide a "safe harbor" for adults that would preserve their right to watch or listen to indecent programs. In effect, that meant allowing indecent programming between 8 P.M. and 6 A.M.</p>
        <p>Congress quickly responded that year by passing legislation that imposed a round-the-clock ban on indecent programming. The commission came up with new regulations, this time bolstered by surveys about the viewing habits of children, but the appeals court here rejected those rules in 1991.</p>
        <p>Congress passed a second law in 1992, this time allowing broadcasters to carry indecent programming between midnight and 6 A.M. and allowing some public television stations that went off the air at midnight to begin such broadcasts at 10. The commission adopted a new set of regulations the next year.</p>
        <p>In today's ruling, the court said the latest restrictions were narrowly tailored to the public need and "would not unduly burden the First Amendment."</p>
        <p>It rejected pleas by opponents of the rules to permit indecent programming as early as 8 P.M. and also rejected arguments that the rules should be tailored to children younger than 12, upholding rules intended for anyone younger than 18.</p>
        <p>Chief Judge Harry T. Edwards, one of the four dissenters, lambasted the majority's ruling. In his strongly worded dissent, Judge Edwards said the court had embraced an "utterly irrational distinction" by agreeing with Congress not to apply the indecency rules to cable television. More broadly, Judge Edwards said, the Government had simply gone too far in restricting speech.</p>
        <p>"The commission has failed to show that its secondary interest, protecting children from exposure to indecent broadcast, is compelling when it conflicts with the rights of parents to rear their children in the way they see fit," he wrote.</p>
