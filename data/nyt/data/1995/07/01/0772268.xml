        <p>In an action that could lead to the first state takeover of a local school district in New York history, lawmakers in Albany today approved legislation to give state officials broad authority over the troubled Roosevelt school system in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>The bill, adopted by both houses of the Legislature just before the end of the legislative session, would not only create a panel of experts to oversee improvements in the district, but would also allow the state to take control of the system if the local school board drags its feet.</p>

        <p>In an action that could lead to the first state takeover of a local school district in New York history, lawmakers in Albany today approved legislation to give state officials broad authority over the troubled Roosevelt school system in Nassau County.</p>
        <p>The bill, adopted by both houses of the Legislature just before the end of the legislative session, would not only create a panel of experts to oversee improvements in the district, but would also allow the state to take control of the system if the local school board drags its feet.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said today that he was leaning toward signing the bill.</p>
        <p>"It is a historic action for the State of New York, because for the first time a power has been created to put the Regents and the commissioner of education in the position of running a local school district," said State Senator Norman J. Levy, Republican of Merrick, whose district includes Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>For years, Education Commissioner Thomas Sobol, a holdover from the Cuomo administration who leaves office today, had been seeking the authority to seize control of distressed districts like Roosevelt, a 3,000-student system that is more than 90 percent black and encompasses one of the most hard-pressed communities in a county that is largely affluent and white.</p>
        <p>The vote in Albany was viewed by politicians and educators as a watershed. In recent years, New Jersey has taken over some of that state's largest urban districts, but has had broader success in repairing buildings than raising academic performance, officials there have acknowledged.</p>
        <p>Still, some New York educators say state officials here have to be willing to step in and help the troubled districts.</p>
        <p>"I think it marks a more assertive role on the part of the state," said Dr. Daniel Domenech, a school superintendent from Long Island who, under orders from Mr. Sobol, led an inspection team into Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School for three days in April.</p>
        <p>His report, detailing structural, security and educational problems in the school -- problems like students who roam hallways at will and lockers so dilapidated they were unusable -- prompted Mr. Levy and Assemblywoman Earlene Hill, Democrat of Hempstead, to draft separate versions of legislation to allow the state to seize control of the district.</p>
        <p>In Roosevelt, parents and community leaders have been divided over the prospect of state supervision. Although some have welcomed the idea of outside help, others say they worry about what messages that sends about the town.</p>
        <p>"For some people it's like a shame thing," said Robert Lawrence, a former member of the school board who has lived in the town since 1965. "But I don't feel it's embarrassing. Let them come in, but let the community have some say."</p>
        <p>Members of the school board did not respond to calls, and Superintendent Will Singleton did not return several calls.</p>
        <p>The acting deputy education commissioner, James A. Kadamus, said it was too soon to say whether the legislation could be applied statewide. "Part of our judging of our success in this is whether we can build the capability of the local board to implement the plan and run the schools, and if we can't do that some other kind of intervention is necessary," Mr. Kadamus said. "If we are able to do it, it may serve as a model for dealing with other situations."</p>
        <p>Dr. Domenech, who heads the Bureau of Cooperative Educational Services in Nassau County, said the legislation sent a message beyond Roosevelt. "Undoubtedly other districts with similar circumstances will sit up and take notice, knowing it is very easy to replace in a bill the name of a district," he said.</p>
        <p>Representatives of local boards, however, saw the measure as a step backward. The executive director of the New York State School Boards Association, Louis Grumet, said the state had failed in the past to assist Roosevelt, even though it has had the authority to accomplish much of what the bill seeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grumet said the commissioner already had the power to appoint special deputies for troubled districts and suspend superintendents and school boards.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Kadamus said the existing powers were either too weak or too strong. The special deputies have just the authority to advise, he said, and the department did not want to dismiss summarily local officials who had community support.</p>
        <p>The bill approved today represents a compromise, Mr. Levy said, between his bill and the legislation offered by Ms. Hill, who advocated a more direct state takeover and immediate suspension of the local board.</p>
        <p>Under the bill the State Board of Regents would appoint a three-member panel that, in consultation with the five-member Roosevelt board, would devise a "corrective action plan." The plan would be submitted by July 31 to the Regents, who would have the power to redistribute staff members and money, but not to spend any more money than the district now budgets.</p>
        <p>The measure would also give the Regents power to remove the board members from office if, in the panel's view, they impede the progress of the plan. In addition, an advisory council of 11 residents and school employees would work with the school board and the panel.</p>
