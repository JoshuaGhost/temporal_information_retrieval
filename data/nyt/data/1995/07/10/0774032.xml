        <p>NIGHTMOVER How Aldrich Ames Sold the C.I.A. to the K.G.B. for $4.6 Million  By David Wise  Illustrated. 356 pages. HarperCollins. $25. KILLER SPY The Inside Story of the F.B.I.'s Pursuit and Capture of Aldrich Ames, America's Deadliest Spy  By Peter Maas  Illustrated. 243 pages. Warner Books. $21.95. SELLOUT Aldrich Ames and the Corruption of the C.I.A.  By James Adams  Illustrated. 322 pages. Viking. $23.95.</p>
        <p>There's no question that Aldrich Ames, whose spying for the Soviet Union cost the lives of some 10 American agents and thereby obliterated the C.I.A.'s human penetration of the Russian system, was very bad for the United States. But Mr. Ames was, as reporters often put it, a good story. He was a real-life John le Carre character involved in a cold-war tale of espionage, treason and bureaucratic failure. This no doubt explains why Mr. Ames's eight-year career as a highly placed mole and his capture by the Federal Bureau of Investigation has produced a large crop of books.</p>
        <p>The three under review here all tell the story briskly and well. Indeed, there is not a great deal of reason to choose one over the others. Peter Maas adheres most closely to the standard formula in the telling of such stories, squeezing drama from the material, ending chapters on page-turning notes of portent ("Ames's squinty eyes, angular face, and pointy nose made him look just like a mole"), dwelling on the details and the excitement involved in the F.B.I.'s actual capture of the spy.</p>
        <p>The accounts by David Wise and James Adam are richer in background information -- Mr. Wise is especially sophisticated as he discusses the inner workings of the spy trade -- and they provide fuller pictures of the agents working for our side whose lives were destroyed by Mr. Ames's perfidy. Mr. Adams is the only one who attempts to draw some deeper meaning from the Ames affair, arguing that "his cumulative acts of treachery have so undermined the American intelligence community that it will be changed forever by his acts," but he does not delve deeply into this theme.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Adams, like the other chroniclers, sticks mostly to the story of espionage and betrayal. Mr. Ames was 44 when he began his career as a traitor. In his 23-year career at the C.I.A. he had been posted in Mexico City and Rome and, in 1985, was at the agency's headquarters in Virginia as chief of the Soviet counterintelligence branch. "He knew it all," Mr. Wise reports. And he told it all, starting with the day he walked into the Soviet Embassy in Washington and handed over a letter addressed to the K.G.B. station chief offering to sell classified information for $50,000.</p>
        <p>The Soviets knew a good thing when they saw it. They readily accepted Mr. Ames's offer and made clear to him that if he kept the information coming, there would be a lot more than $50,000 for him. There were millions more before Mr. Ames was finally unmasked in 1993. Given that the West did win the cold war, it is clear that his information was not decisive in the larger struggle. But very early on in his relationship with the K.G.B., Mr. Ames loaded up a plastic bag with secret documents that gave away the identities of several Russians who were agents for the United States, including two who were working right there in the Soviet Embassy in Washington. They and a number of others were tortured and executed as a result of the information Mr. Ames provided. Among them was Gen. Dimitri Fedorovich Polyakov, considered by many the most valuable spy in the C.I.A.'s history until, as Mr. Wise writes, "Aldrich Ames turned him in."</p>
        <p>All three writers try to deal with the biggest question left behind by the Ames scandal: How did he get away with it for so long? In retrospect, at least, it is clear that Mr. Ames should never have been trusted with high responsibility in the first place. He was a drunk. His lie-detector tests were inconclusive at best.  While he fed the Soviets information right out of the C.I.A.'s computers, he and his wife lived conspicuously beyond their means. The C.I.A. knew that its Soviet agents were being given away, yet Mr. Ames remained in place for eight years.</p>
        <p>These books explain the problem in part with references to the "culture" of the C.I.A., which discourages the idea that there can be traitors in its midst. There was also the heritage of James Angleton, the former counterintelligence chief whose fanatical search for moles in the 1960's left the agency so demoralized that it overreacted by never wanting to search for moles again. And there is what might be called the fog of espionage, or, as Mr. Angleton himself put it, "the wilderness of mirrors." There are too many actors involved to easily locate suspects, and it is difficult to know if a particular compromise was caused by a mole or by some technical feat of the other side.</p>
        <p>Why did Mr. Ames do it? Mr. Maas stresses the money and Mr. Ames's need to indulge his greedy and demanding wife, Rosario, who became a co-conspirator in the last couple of years. Mr. Maas's citations from wiretapped conversations make for the most unflattering portrait of Mrs. Ames. Mr. Adams, by contrast, the only one of the three authors to have interviewed her, seems at times to be taken in by her self-serving versions of events. In any case, surely there were other C.I.A. employees who needed money and did not become traitors. To try to explain why Mr. Ames did, the authors mention other ingredients: his low self-esteem, his evolving politics, which put him in many ways closer to the Russians than to the Americans, the thrill of outsmarting the system that employed him. In the end, the answer remains elusive.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mrs. Ames, who is serving a six-year prison sentence in a state of denial and depression, Mr. Ames, according to these writers, seems content despite his life sentence. He was besieged with interview requests. Connie Chung actually embraced him. He was interviewed on CNN and quoted in newspapers around the globe. He has become famous, a legend. Meanwhile, as all of the writers note, he has never expressed a word of regret for the men he destroyed.</p>
