        <p>The opening of Mexican markets to American business under the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement faltered for the first time this week with the decision by United Parcel Service to cancel some of its ground services in Mexico.</p>
        <p>U.P.S., the American package delivery giant, said Tuesday that it would stop its cross-border deliveries by ground transporation between the United States and Mexico as of July 31. The company made the decision even though trade officials of the United States and Mexico have been trying to improve market conditions for U.P.S. in Mexico.</p>
        <p>U.P.S.'s decision was based on several factors. The company's main complaint was about "very burdensome" and time-consuming inspections by Mexican customs authorities at the border, the company spokesman, Ken Sternad, said yesterday. Mexican law requires that customs agents examine every package, no matter how small, coming across the border. U.P.S. tractor-trailers sometimes carried thousands of packages in a single load.</p>
        <p>U.P.S. was also unable to get permits to use 18-wheel tractor-trailers to haul cargo between major cities in Mexico. It was restricted to using smaller and less efficient vehicles the size of the familiar brown trucks that bring packages to doorsteps across the United States.</p>
        <p>On April 26, after almost two years of informal United States complaints, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, resorted, for the first time with Mexico, to the trade agreement's procedures for resolving trade disputes in order to press the case for U.P.S. Mr. Kantor said Mexico's refusal to issue permits for the bigger trucks was a violation of the trade agreement's terms, which require equal treatment for Mexican and American companies. Mexican haulers are allowed to use the large tractor-trailers to carry small packages.</p>
        <p>But U.P.S. officials were not confident the matter would be resolved quickly enough to help their business.</p>
        <p>"We didn't see any resolution in the near term and we didn't see making any money or guaranteeing our customers reliable service," Mr. Sternad said. "The process with Mexico of freer trade has been arduous, in the most polite way we could describe it."</p>
        <p>U.P.S. also feared that Mexico would issue new regulations that could further restrict its ground services there. But U.P.S said it would continue two services of carrying packages by air between the United States and Mexico, and would use trucks to deliver them door-to-door.</p>
        <p>Aaron Dichter, Mexico's Under Secretary for Transportation, said today from Mexico City that he was surprised by the U.P.S. move because Mexico yesterday sent the United States a draft of new regulations that he said would resolve the issue of truck sizes.</p>
        <p>"We did it," he said. "There's not going to be a problem. They will be able to use the type of vehicle they want. We have to do it to comply with Nafta." United States trade officials said they had not had a chance to study the proposal. The Mexican Government has been struggling with tough resistance by Mexican truckers to allowing foreign companies to use big trailers for package services.</p>
        <p>On Saturday the United States will have the option of increasing the pressure on Mexico by initiating arbitration under the terms of the trade agreement. But United States officials said it was unlikely they would move to arbitration right away because the talks were producing results.</p>
        <p>The dispute will continue in spite of U.P.S.'s decision because U.P.S. and several other American companies, including DHL and Federal Express, remain interested in securing better treatment in Mexico, United States officials said.</p>
        <p>But U.P.S. said its decision on the cross-border routes was final, closing out for some time its hopes of offering a low-cost delivery service for packages that do not have to be rushed and forcing Americans who want to send small items to Mexico to bear the higher costs of air transportation.</p>
