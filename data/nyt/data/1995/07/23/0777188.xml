        <p>The Irish Government has decided to press for the removal of Ireland's constitutional ban on divorce in a national referendum later this year, officials said Friday.</p>
        <p>If the Government campaign succeeds, it will mean that overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Ireland, the only European Union country that still prohibits divorce, would permit it for the first time. Removing the ban would also make it possible for the thousands of Irish who have obtained foreign divorces to remarry in this country.</p>
        <p>Officials and proponents of allowing divorce, while careful not to predict victory in the referendum, tentatively scheduled for the end of November, said that several serious obstacles to their campaign had been overcome in recent days. On Thursday, the Cabinet of Prime Minister John Bruton reportedly agreed that the language of the referendum question would state that divorce would be possible after a couple had lived apart for at least four years.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the year, as some in Mr. Bruton's Fine Gael party appeared to be hesitating on the issue, the referendum appeared in danger of being postponed. The campaign has the support of Fine Gael's coalition partners, the Labor and Democratic Left parties, as well as the principal opposition party, Fianna Fail.</p>
        <p>A week ago, the Supreme Court ruled that the Irish Constitution, which explicitly forbids divorce, does not preclude granting legal separations after a one-year waiting period. Proponents of allowing divorce said the coalition Government could incorporate the ruling in the wording of a referendum measure that would ask the nation, for the second time in nine years, whether it is ready to allow divorce.</p>
        <p>In 1986, voters rejected a divorce measure by a 2 to 1 margin, after it was strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic hierarchy in Ireland. In that campaign, the church and other opponents argued that divorce would bring injustices in property rights and pensions. But the church stopped short of saying that voting to permit divorce would be a sin, stating that a vote was a matter of individual conscience. This time, the church has made no immediate comment on the Government's plans or the court's decision.</p>
        <p>The court, noting that the couple had lived apart for a year, ruled against an estranged husband who was seeking to gain custody of his children and to overturn the legal separation his wife had obtained.</p>
        <p>Government officials have not disclosed specifics of the wording of the referendum because they do not want to give opponents the entire summer to attack it. Groups opposing divorce say they are already planning a vigorous campaign.</p>
        <p>Anne Marie Gill, the chief executive of the National Women's Council of Ireland, an umbrella group, said that by its decision, "the court has decided that the protection of the family is not served by precluding those whose marriages have failed from formalizing a separation."</p>
        <p>Article 41 of the 1937 Constitution says: "The state pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the Family is founded, and to protect it against attack. No law shall be enacted providing for the dissolution of marriage." It bars people who have obtained divorces in other countries from remarrying in Ireland. And the marriages of Irish citizens who go abroad to remarry are not recognized legally.</p>
        <p>Proponents of a divorce law say there are 70,000 separated couples in this country of 3.5 million. In 1993, there were 15,000 marriages in Ireland, 3,000 orders issued barring one spouse from the household, and 1,000 applications for separation.</p>
