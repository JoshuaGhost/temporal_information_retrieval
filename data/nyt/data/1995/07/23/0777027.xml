        <p>Once upon a time, the intersection of Broadway and 42d Street on the island of Manhattan in the city of New York was the glittering "crossroads of the world" -- Times Square, the exciting center of entertainment in America's grandest metropolis.

        <p>Once upon a time, the intersection of Broadway and 42d Street on the island of Manhattan in the city of New York was the glittering "crossroads of the world" -- Times Square, the exciting center of entertainment in America's grandest metropolis. The glitter turned into sleaze some years ago, when theaters that staged the likes of Ziegfeld Follies became XXX-rated movie houses. But the good old days appear to be coming back now, in fancy -- and costly -- modern dress.</p>
        <p>Led by the Walt Disney Company with a generous helping of city and state subsidies, tentative plans for key elements of the sleaziest block in the neighborhood -- the stretch of 42d between Seventh and Eighth Avenues -- have now become firm. With the signing of three substantial deals this month, others seem more likely.</p>
        <p>Disney is undertaking a $34 million restoration of the 92-year-old New Amsterdam Theater, where it plans to produce musical spectacles that it hopes will be as successful as its hit "Beauty and the Beast." Talk about modern dress: Elton John and Tim Rice have already put together several songs for a possible Disney update of "Aida"! Disney also plans a Disney store next door.</p>
        <p>Down the street, the proprietors of Madame Tussaud's famous London waxworks are newly committed to an American version, combined with a 25-screen movie complex belonging to the American Multi-Cinemas chain. Altogether, this will be a $150 million project. A fourth project, restoring a theater for young people's productions, has been under way for some time and is nearly completed.</p>
        <p>Tentative plans for a $300 million hotel and entertainment complex at one end of the block still need financing. Plans for the construction of four office towers at the other end -- originally the key to the entire development plan -- are on hold until the real estate market is strong enough to support them. Still another flashy scheme announced in recent days would create one huge theater by combining two smaller ones.</p>
        <p>The New York Times, based only a block away on 43d Street, has an obvious interest in the success of the overall plan to resurrect the area. (Times Square was Longacre Square before the newspaper came along.) But the greater signficance of the plan is revitalization of a vital sector of the city -- the theater district, a magnet for visitors and New Yorkers alike and for the creative talent that produces the entertainment they come to see. The iffy elements of this plan still need a lot of work. But with some solid elements in place now, the Rialto seems well on its way to revival.</p>
