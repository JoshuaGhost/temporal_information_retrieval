        <p>CARDINAL RICHELIEU, Talleyrand, and Charles de Gaulle were all masters of diplomatic leverage, multiplying French influence in the councils of the world and sometimes turning defeat into victory, skills the French admire in their leaders.</p>
        <p>Jacques Chirac, an admirer of de Gaulle who was elected President a little more than two months ago, has clearly learned a lot from his predecessors.</p>
        <p>He provoked international outrage last month by announcing a resumption of French nuclear testing in the South Pacific. Last week, he broke with decades of French ambivalence and accepted moral responsibility for the Vichy regime's deportation of tens of thousands of French Jews to German death camps during World War II.</p>
        <p>What may have pleased the French most is that he put the country back in the center of European and world diplomacy by forthrightly denouncing Western policy in Bosnia as the modern-day equivalent of the sellout of Czechoslovakia in 1938 and demanding that Britain and the United States join France in sending ground forces into the United Nations "safe areas" in Bosnia to protect them against Bosnian Serb attack.</p>
        <p>"Boldness, again boldness, and always boldness," said the 18th century French revolutionary Danton, and Mr. Chirac was not afraid to risk failure in making his proposals. In the end, they were not accepted. But they weren't quite rejected either, and Mr. Chirac could hold his head up.</p>
        <p>While France is no longer the dominant power of Europe, as it was in the days of Louis XIV and Napoleon, under Mr. Chirac it has become the most dynamic. His aim is much the same as de Gaulle's was when he expressed "a certain idea of France" -- one with a moral grandeur that has often been greater than reality.</p>
        <p>France is one of the few countries in the Western world that still has huge military parades on its national day. This July 14, just after Mr. Chirac had made his stirring call for stronger military action in Bosnia, wave after wave of smartly uniformed French troops, including bearded Foreign Legionnaires in distinctive tan leather aprons, trooped down the Champs Elysees, as supersonic Mirage and Rafale fighters and bombers roared overhead -- but all that military strength was not enough, not all by itself, to change the situation in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>Careful Phrasing</p>
        <p>Thus Mr. Chirac had to phrase his call carefully. France could not save Sarajevo or Gorazde all by itself, he said; it would need help from British soldiers, and American transport helicopters and aircraft. If Britain and the United States did not go along, he threatened, then France would call for withdrawal of the entire 39,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force.</p>
        <p>There was Gallic logic here, and plenty of shrewd Cartesian calculation. The French propositions put the United States on the spot. If Europe failed in Bosnia, he was saying, the United States would bear much of the blame. The United States, the French never tire of saying, has refused to send soldiers there, while France has lost 40.</p>
        <p>These losses played hardly any role in the French election campaign. But every French patriotic breast suffered a pang of outrage in May when the Bosnian Serbs took peacekeepers hostage and handcuffed them to military targets so that United States and NATO warplanes would stop bombing them. "One can understand that soldiers can be wounded, or even killed, but one cannot allow soldiers to be humiliated," Mr. Chirac said, explaining his decision to send thousands more troops to Bosnia to prevent this sort of thing from happening again.</p>
        <p>Death before dishonor, a French virtue celebrated in the Alexandrine verses of Corneille and Racine, is a concept those Foreign Legionnaires coming down the avenue in solemn cadence on July 14 have lived by for decades, and 2,000 of them are now in Bosnia ready to live or die by it today.</p>
        <p>The French are often puzzled, if not embittered, by the reluctance of Americans, with so much more power, to risk as much. Gradually, the reluctance is taking its toll. On the eve of a meeting with President Clinton last month, Mr. Chirac said he would not take the leader of the Western world to task. "I believe that the Atlantic Alliance has no leader," he said.</p>
        <p>Any Walter Mitty-like thoughts that Mr. Chirac may have had that he could claim this position for himself were not realized at the international meeting on Bosnia in London on Friday, which ended with a vague but determined-sounding threat to respond with extensive air strikes if the Serbs attacked Gorazde. This might seem a way for the Americans to politely avoid any commitment to send helicopters and men soon, as the French had demanded, but the French pronounced themselves satisfied and took credit for putting backbone back into the international community over Bosnia. (How much backbone is another question, of course, as it always has been in Bosnia; right away, questions arose about whether the threat can be carried out.)</p>
        <p>Lip Service</p>
        <p>France's aspirations may not be so bold as to lead the NATO alliance, but France has always aspired to lead a united Europe. De Gaulle, who kicked NATO headquarters out of France in 1966 and withdrew French troops from its military chain of command, did so because he didn't want Europe's defenses to depend on Americans. Now Mr. Chirac is resuming nuclear testing because he doesn't want France's nuclear deterrent or French national security to depend on them, or anybody else.</p>
        <p>France has always given lip service to the idea of leading Europe through close partnership with Germany, but the Germans are miffed that the French President did not consult with them (or anybody else in Europe) about resuming the bomb tests.</p>
        <p>The French, of course, saw no reason to do so; Germany may be the most powerful country in Europe, but it is self-conscious and inhibited, and it is not a nuclear power. And as for European foreign policy, the first objective of the European Union when it proclaimed such a policy in 1991 was a united approach in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>"In Europe, it is difficult for a single state to do anything, because our old nation-states are of relatively equal weight," said Anne-Marie Le Gloannec, a political scientist, in The Figaro last week. "During the period of the cold war, America had to become in a way a European state. Today, the United States doesn't want to lead any more."</p>
        <p>That leaves the field, in the French view, to Mr. Chirac, who, having reasserted the French presence in the South Pacific by lifting the nuclear testing moratorium put in place by his predecessor, Francois Mitterrand, is now touring France's former domains in Africa. During a banquet in Morocco, Mr. Chirac's old friend King Hassan II offered this toast: "I ask you to stand up and honor our dear friend, the President of France, Jacques Mitterrand." As the French say, c'est la guerre.</p>
