        <p>The sudden illness forced the 69-year-old Secretary to miss a dinner given tonight by Prime Minister Jean Chretien. The State Department said that Mr. Christopher's appearances scheduled Friday as part of Mr. Clinton's visit would also canceled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher asked to be taken to the hospital at about 6 P.M. after noticing blood in his stool, the doctors said at a briefing tonight at Ottawa Civic Hospital. They said they had discovered a small stomach ulcer after running a tube from his mouth into his abdomen.</p>
        <p>Chris Carruthers, the hospital's vice president for medical affairs, said the doctors recommended that Mr. Christopher stay overnight as a precaution. He said that medication should allow the ulcer to heal within several weeks and that Mr. Chrisopher had been in no danger and was "fit as a fiddle."</p>
