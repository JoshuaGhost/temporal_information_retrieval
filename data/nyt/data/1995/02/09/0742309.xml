        <p>After several days of pummeling from anti-abortion groups over his abortion record, President Clinton's nominee for Surgeon General broke his public silence tonight, saying in a nationally televised interview that he had performed 39 abortions, far more than previously acknowledged by him and the White House, but that he opposed the procedure.</p>
        <p>"I abhor abortions; I abhor war," the nominee, Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr., said in an interview on the ABC News program "Nightline." "To me, abortion is failure. I don't like failure."</p>

        <p>After several days of pummeling from anti-abortion groups over his abortion record, President Clinton's nominee for Surgeon General broke his public silence tonight, saying in a nationally televised interview that he had performed 39 abortions, far more than previously acknowledged by him and the White House, but that he opposed the procedure.</p>
        <p>"I abhor abortions; I abhor war," the nominee, Dr. Henry W. Foster Jr., said in an interview on the ABC News program "Nightline." "To me, abortion is failure. I don't like failure."</p>
        <p>Appearing relaxed and eager to talk, Dr. Foster spoke of some of the bumbling that had accompanied his nomination, especially over the issue of just how many abortions he had performed, the subject his opponents have made the focus of their attacks against him.</p>
        <p>"Washington is a fast town and I'm becoming a fast study," he said. "I should have refused to answer that question."</p>
        <p>Dr. Foster suggested that the confusion over the number of abortions was the result of miscommunication between himself and the White House. Initially, the Administration said he had performed one abortion, but a day later Dr. Foster said in a statement that the number was "fewer than a dozen." Then anti-abortion groups weighed in with documents suggesting that the doctor had performed perhaps scores more abortions than he had acknowledged.</p>
        <p>The White House has given conflicting accounts of just how many abortions Dr. Foster has performed, and anti-abortion groups have made that one of the points of their attacks against the nominee.</p>
        <p>Dr. Foster tonight laid much of the blame for the confusion over his abortion record on the White House.</p>
        <p>He said it was only after his nomination was announced on Feb. 2 that White House officials asked him whether he had ever performed an abortion. He said he told a senior Administration official whom he did not name that he had and then cited a case that had stuck in his mind involving a mother with AIDS.</p>
        <p>The White House, he said, took this to mean that he had performed just one abortion and then passed that information along to some members of Congress. A day later, he said, when the White House learned of the error, Administration officials asked Dr. Foster to issue a statement in which he said he had performed "fewer than a dozen" abortions.</p>
        <p>"It was a guess and I should not have made it," he said.</p>
        <p>He indicated that he felt pressured to give an answer, but vowed henceforth "to make up my own mind about what I want to do."</p>
        <p>"I will not be pushed again to do something or give numbers or to depend on my memory," he said. "I will be much more factual or I will refuse to respond."</p>
        <p>"All of my patient records and all of the operative logs from the time I went to Meharry in 1973 until tonight have revealed that I was listed as the physician of record on 39 of those cases," said Mr. Foster, who attended Meharry Medical Center in Nashville.</p>
        <p>Dr. Foster was questioned by Ted Koppel of ABC in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in an interview arranged at the urging of the Clinton Administration. The Administration also insisted that the interview be conducted at the White House, Mr. Koppel said.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he thought the political heat and controversy would force him to walk away from the nomination, Dr. Foster replied: "I'm a big fighter. I'm going with the process all the way."</p>
        <p>After his nomination, Dr. Foster, an obstetrician and gynecologist from Tennessee, came under immediate attack from anti-abortion groups after he acknowledged that he had performed abortions. Until tonight, Mr. Foster had tried to maintain the kind of public silence that is traditional for Presidential nominees before their confirmation hearings.</p>
        <p>But in recent days it became clear that the White House plan for Dr. Foster to try to ignore the opposition was failing and that the nomination was heading for trouble in the Senate, which confirms Cabinet appointments. The White House strategy even angered many supporters of the nomination, including some Democrats who criticized the White House response as inept.</p>
        <p>To prepare for his television appearance tonight, Dr. Foster spent much of the day at the White House in a meeting with two of President Clinton's senior advisers, George Stephanopoulos and Mark D. Gearan.</p>
        <p>During the taping of the television program, Dr. Foster was stern-faced at times and anxious to be heard.</p>
        <p>"My credibility is at stake and I have to do something about it," he said.</p>
        <p>He spent much of the 11-minute interview ticking off highlights of his medical career and talking about the campaign against teen-age pregnancies that first brought him national attention.</p>
        <p>After spending days watching Dr. Foster being battered over his abortion record and seemingly without a plan to defend him, the White House appeared to have found its stride today. President Clinton held a luncheon meeting with a group of House Democrats, including some who a day before had openly complained that he had mishandled the nomination.</p>
        <p>And a collection of groups that support Dr. Foster gathered on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>About 100 officials and supporters of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America from 32 states held a rally outside the Capitol, and the National Organization for Women began a letter-writing and telephone campaign to stir up political support for the nominee.</p>
        <p>"We urge you to consider Dr. Foster's merit as a doctor and leader in the fight against teen-age pregnancy and to condemn attacks against him for what they are -- another attempt to eliminate the constitutional right to abortion,"the executive vice president of NOW, Kim Gandy, said in a letter sent to senators.</p>
        <p>The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League announced a nationwide campaign to save Dr. Foster's nomination.</p>
        <p>The anti-abortion groups that have led the opposition to the nomination were just as active today.</p>
        <p>Leaders of a cluster of such groups -- including the Life Education and Resource Network, the National Clergy Council and the Christian Defense Coalition -- came to the Capitol to urge the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, to lead the fight against the nomination.</p>
