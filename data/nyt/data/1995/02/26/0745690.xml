        <p>Clear signs that Mexico's economic crisis is worsening have forced the Government to concede that its original economic stabilization plan has failed and that a tougher new plan of budget cuts and tax increases will have to be enacted soon.</p>
        <p>President Ernesto Zedillo announced his original damage-control plan on Jan. 3, but Mexican officials say it failed to arrest stampeding inflation and an impending recession largely because the United States took too long to deliver the vital financial assistance that President Clinton offered to help Mexico.</p>
        <p>Ever since the $20 billion American rescue package was finally signed on Tuesday, President Zedillo has been busy telling Mexicans the crisis is under control. Meanwhile, his top financial advisers have been drafting a darkly realistic new rescue plan that shows Mexico is slipping further into the inflationary whirlpool of rapidly rising wages and prices that it had vowed to avoid.</p>
        <p>Government officials who have worked on early drafts of the new plan, which Mr. Zedillo said would be announced "very soon," say it slashes predictions of economic growth for 1995 from 1.5 percent to zero or even negative growth, which would mean that the Government is finally acknowledging the inevitability of a recession. Many economists say one has already begun. Inflation, which was projected at 19 percent in the original plan, is now expected to soar to almost double that figure.</p>
        <p>The projected exchange rate of 4.5 pesos to the dollar, on which the economic projections of the plan were based, is replaced with an imposing new rate of 5 to 5.5 pesos to the dollar. This means that the peso would be worth no more than 18 to 20 cents, rather than 22 cents.</p>
        <p>The new plan anticipates that taxes will be increased sharply, prices for gasoline and electricity produced by the state will rise, and the federal budget will be cut severely to produce the surplus of five-tenths of 1 percent that United States officials demanded as one condition for signing a $20 billion rescue package. The American assistance will go a long way toward resolving Mexico's most immediate problem -- paying off billions of dollars in short-term debt -- but it will do little to solve the economy's fundamental problems.</p>
        <p>"Since Jan. 3, we've been fighting not to adjust the economy but simply to control a situation of economic panic," President Zedillo said during an informal talk over tequila and chimichangas after several optimistic speeches on Thursday in the central state of Zacatecas, where he had gone to raise the spirits of Mexicans. He said the original plan might have been successful in controlling Mexico's out-of-balance current account deficit, the broadest measure of a nation's goods and services, "but now we know the problems go far deeper than that."</p>
        <p>Mexican officials working on the new economic stabilization plan also say it will differ from the original because it abandons the social pact between Government, labor and business that has long characterized the preferred method of controlling the economy.</p>
        <p>Instead of sitting down with labor and business leaders to negotiate the kind of wage and price controls that so far this year have failed to hold the line, officials say the Government will act on its own powers. That will entail sharply cutting the federal budget and maintaining interest rates at historically high levels to restrain inflation and stabilize the exchange rate.</p>
        <p>Minimum wages might be raised by 5 percent, but the increase will not be used as a guideline for union contract wages, which will be negotiated separately, officials said.</p>
        <p>The Government is also preparing an emergency employment program to relieve the pressure of the budget cuts from areas where social and political tensions have been high, like the southern states of Chiapas and Tabasco.</p>
        <p>Mexican officials say their initial plan of Jan. 3 was intended to work in tandem with a quick infusion of money from the United States. One important member of Mr. Zedillo's economic team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the assistance was expected to come a few days after President Clinton and Congressional leaders in Washington announced on Jan. 12 that the United States would provide $40 billion in loan guarantees.</p>
        <p>Despite the strong initial backing of President Clinton and Congressional leaders, that offer of help met stiff opposition in Washington and was eventually abandoned. Mr. Clinton used his executive powers to put together a $20 billion package that did not need Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>"In the end it really took quite a long time for the money to come," the Mexican official said. "In the meantime there was a lot of nervousness in the market. People were getting worried. Investors wanted to see a signed agreement. As time passed, the uncertainty affected interest rates and the exchange rate."</p>
        <p>The official said it was clear that as inflation and unemployment worsened and prices headed for the heavens, the economic targets of the Jan. 3 stabilization plan had become impossible to reach. "But," he said, "it wouldn't have made any sense for the Government to put out new figures until the American package was signed."</p>
        <p>Even the signing of the agreement with the United States on Tuesday has failed to calm Mexico's financial markets. Since Tuesday morning, the Mexican stock exchange has fallen 212 points, including a drop of 57.8 points, or 3.6 percent, on Friday. In all, the exchange's index dropped 15 percent this week.</p>
        <p>The conclusion of the American assistance package on Tuesday also did not help the peso much. On Friday, its value fell another 3 percent to close at 5.875 to the dollar. Since its devaluation in December, the peso, once worth almost 29 cents, has lost 41 percent of its value and is now worth just over 17 cents.</p>
        <p>There are several other signs that Mexico's economic crisis is deepening. The Bank of Mexico reported on Thursday that inflation for the first half of February was 2.2 percent, which would amount to 67 percent on an annual basis, another indication that the initial stabilization plan failed to control prices.</p>
        <p>Interest rates also have soared to historic levels in Mexico, causing further havoc with the economy. Just this week, rates on Government treasury certificates reached 59 percent, while an important interbank interest rate soared to 74 percent. That bank rate is used to determine interest for mortgages, car loans and credit cards, which now charge 97 percent annual interest.</p>
        <p>Those interest rates have forced many debtors to fall behind on bank loans. The Government this week required banks to increase their reserves to cover uncollectable loans.</p>
        <p>Mexico's businesses have also been hammered by the interest rate increases and other effects of the peso's devaluation. The president of one of Mexico's most important business councils, Luis German Carcoba, estimated this week that 250,000 jobs had been lost since January.</p>
        <p>Mexican officials say they think the new plan being worked on at Los Pinos, the Mexican White House, will not put the economy back on track before the end of the year. They call it an adjustment of the original, which they say was at least successful in reducing the trade imbalance that contributed to Mexico's economic woes.</p>
        <p>Figures released on Thursday show that Mexican exports shot up 35 percent in January, largely because the devaluation has made the country's products cheaper. But imports increased 7.9 percent, indicating that Mexicans' craving for foreign products has not gone away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zedillo told cheering supporters in Zacatecas on Thursday that Mexico "will not be conquered by a temporary crisis," but members of his administration say there have been serious setbacks and the future remains uncertain.</p>
        <p>"We have had to recognize that the financial markets haven't evolved as we thought they should," said a presidential adviser familiar with the new recovery plan. "The shocks to the market have been longer and deeper than we originally thought. How much longer or deeper will they go? I couldn't say."</p>
