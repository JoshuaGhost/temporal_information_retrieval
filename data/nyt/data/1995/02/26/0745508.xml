        <p>OVERCOMING LAW By Richard A. Posner. 597 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. $39.95.</p>
        <p>THE Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has given his new book, "Overcoming Law," an odd title -- odd because we think judges should study and apply the law, not try to overcome it. But Richard A. Posner is no ordinary judge. Before his appointment to the bench in 1981, he was a professor of law at the University of Chicago, and for years he has been one of the most articulate spokesmen for the scholarly movement known as "law and economics."</p>
        <p>The law and economics movement analyzes legal problems -- like who has the responsibility to foresee the possibility of an accident, or how a contract should be interpreted when its provisions are unclear -- in terms of the costs and benefits faced by rational, self-interested individuals. Alternative solutions are evaluated by asking which set of incentives and disincentives will promote the most efficient use of the resources involved. Should a construction company be liable for the enormous losses incurred when an employee accidentally cut through a power cable and closed down Newark International Airport in January? The answer, the economist would say, should depend largely on whether the cost to the airport of providing a backup power supply would have exceeded the cost to the contractor of having to determine where the cables were before he began his excavations.</p>
        <p>Judge Posner's book applies that method to the legal system itself. It is about the economics of practicing and studying law: the incentives and disincentives faced by judges, lawyers and law professors. The book describes the legal profession as a collapsing cartel, a decadent guild coming to terms with market competition. To those lawyers who complain that their practice is no fun anymore, Judge Posner responds: "Naturally it is less fun. Competitive markets are no fun at all for most sellers; the effect of competition is to transform most producer surplus into consumer surplus."</p>
        <p>Similarly, he describes judges and law professors not as paragons of judicial reason but as leisure seekers. The jurisprudential distinction between the decision in a case and the dictums (the wider arguments for the decision that have no standing as precedents) means that a leisure-seeking judge can avoid writing an opinion of his own; he can simply concur in another judge's vote without being bound, in a later case, by the other's detailed opinions. As for law professors, Judge Posner thinks they behave like wannabe judges, "writing, in the guise of articles, alternative judicial opinions" that no one takes any notice of, and for which they need take no responsibility.</p>
        <p>Much of Judge Posner's discussion is penetrating as well as mischievous, but one wonders what it would portend for the legal system as a whole. Does "overcoming law" mean replacing the tired apparatus of courts, clerks and casebooks with cost-benefit analysis and panels of economic experts? Judge Posner says no: the rule of law is "a public good of immense value," with its norms of impartiality and predictability.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the author is much more explicit in this book than he has been in the past in books like "The Problems of Jurisprudence" about the limitations of the economic approach, at least in determining substantive justice. Judges, he says, "should be wary of embracing totalizing visions that like Gradgrind's Benthamism in 'Hard Times' reduce individual human beings to numbers or objects."</p>
        <p>Economics cannot determine ultimate assignments of rights, he insists. It cannot tell us, for example, whether the right over a fetus's life should be assigned to the mother or the fetus, "any more than the economist can decide whether the goal of our society should be to maximize the wealth of the United States or the wealth of the entire world." An economist can explain a lot about the structures of cost and benefit associated with a given set of rights, and he can sometimes discern which assignment of rights would be more efficient. But Judge Posner readily concedes that efficiency is not the be-all and end-all: "Our liberal intuitions are as deep as our utilitarian ones."</p>
        <p>Many of the most striking arguments in "Overcoming Law" reflect the concerns of a liberal (or a libertarian?), not an economist. "Our statute books overflow with vicious, exploitive, inane, ineffectual and extravagantly costly laws," he writes. We are "the most penal of civilized nations," with our exploding prison population, our thirst for execution, the severe penalties we impose, often "for intrinsically minor, esoteric, archaic or victimless offenses." Judge Posner condemns the practice of handcuffing and thus humiliating anyone who is taken into custody: "The arrest of Joseph K in the first chapter of 'The Trial' is immensely more civilized than any arrest would be likely to be in the land of freedom at the threshold of the 21st century."</p>
        <p>He compares -- startlingly -- our heavy use of pretrial detention, often for years in overcrowded jails, with conditions in Nazi Germany. Even his colleagues on the bench do not escape the comparison: "We should not suppose that our judges have a margin of moral superiority over our political leaders greater than the margin that the German judges of the Third Reich had over their Leader." The main reason, he maintains, that the United States has never had a judiciary in complicity with a Hitler is that it has never had a Hitler to be in complicity with. But the United States, he notes, has had slavery and laws against miscegenation and Red scares and the wartime internment of Japanese-Americans, "and most of our judges went along with these things without protest."</p>
        <p>These are remarkable observations. But his remedy for the evils just cited would seem to be more law -- a greater emphasis on legality, rights and justice. What, then, is the "law" to which the title of the book refers -- the law that needs to be overcome? It is, according to Judge Posner, "a professional totem signifying all that is pretentious, uninformed, prejudiced and spurious in the legal tradition." The most important word here is "uninformed." The theme that dominates this book more than any other is the need for what the author calls "pragmatism" in the way voters, lawyers, judges and professors think about the law.</p>
        <p>Pragmatism, in Judge Posner's hands, is not just a vacuous commendation of common sense, but an unflinching emphasis on future consequences -- the effects of our rules, rights and principles -- to the exclusion, if necessary, of precedent, analogy and doctrine, as these are usually understood in the legal world. Ronald Dworkin, perhaps our foremost philosopher of law, has made much of the fact that legal argument pays tribute to the past even as it seeks to do justice for the future. Judges, he says, continue to wrestle with the meaning of precedents, in a way that goes far beyond figuring out what people might have been counting on, and Mr. Dworkin seeks to explain this in terms of the community maintaining its "integrity."</p>
        <p>For Judge Posner, however, Mr. Dworkin's analysis is superfluous, because the reverence for precedence represents the discredited worst in our judicial practice, not something worth retaining. Think of the uninformed way in which jurists use the method of analogy: "If they have a case involving the appropriate system of property rights for a new natural resource, say petroleum, they examine decided cases dealing with 'similar' resources, say water or rabbits. They do not go out and talk to petroleum engineers, ecologists or natural-resources economists."</p>
        <p>JUDGE POSNER'S most scathing and extensive remarks are reserved for his former colleagues in the law schools. I will not go into details, for some of the chapters are little more than book reviews that have already been published. Many of them will date quickly, and they give the whole thing the feel of a miscellany rather than, as the author hopes, a sustained argument "meant to be read consecutively."</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Judge Posner does present a clear, unrelenting and salutary theme. Legal scholars ought to make much greater use of empirical evidence in suggesting judicial and legislative strategies to achieve a better or a fairer society. Law schools need to foster the basic research necessary for the development of analytical frameworks for organizing and evaluating this evidence. The law and economics movement is one such framework, but Judge Posner is open to the idea that there are others.</p>
        <p>The title of scholar, he insists, is one that has to be earned -- particularly by those who expect to be listened to more than the ordinary citizen in their comments on public affairs. For Judge Posner, the title is not conferred simply by the weight of one's footnotes -- particularly when the footnotes in most law reviews consist of references to the writings of other law professors who have produced similarly uninformed work. The price of scholarship is a willingness to study the empirical reality of issues, and either to acquire the intellectual tools that are necessary to make that study useful or to engage seriously with scholars in other disciplines (economics, sociology, public studies) who already have them.</p>
        <p>Will this advice be taken seriously? Judge Posner believes there is an increasing political gap between law professors and the judiciary, and I doubt whether the "leftward-leaning lawyers" who, he says, dominate constitutional scholarship will be disposed to pay much attention to the methodological advice of a Reagan appointee. It will be a pity, though, if this book is ignored or proscribed. It is by far the best -- the most scholarly, the most thoughtful, as well as the sharpest and most provocative -- of the current crop of commentaries on the plight of law today.
