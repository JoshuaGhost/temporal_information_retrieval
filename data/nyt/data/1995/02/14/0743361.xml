        <p>Another singer, albeit in a different league, is diversifying, too: the soprano JESSYE NORMAN has been elected to the board of managers of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, thanks to a staghorn fern.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, Ms. Norman bought the exotic-looking fern at the garden's annual plant auction.</p>
        <p>"I brought it home, looked after it well, but when I went on a long tour, my assistant didn't know what it was and thought it was dead, so she threw it out," she said. "I was so sick about losing that plant, I never bought another one."</p>
        <p>But she did continue forging bonds with the garden, serving on various committees. On Thursday, she will join the board.</p>
        <p>It's no stretch from opera to gardens, she said.</p>
        <p>"I sing so many songs that have to do with trees, flowers, sunlight and moonlight, and I enjoy being outside," she said. "So much of my professional life is spent inside."</p>
