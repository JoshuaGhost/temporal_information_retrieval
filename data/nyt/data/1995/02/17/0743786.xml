        <p>The drawing seen at the start of Yuri Mamin's "Window to Paris" looks like a charming French street scene, but it disintegrates before the viewer's very eyes. As the picture comes to life, stylized Gallic gaiety gives way to Russian reality, with drab colors, clumsy buffoonery, a circus atmosphere and a long line for vodka destroying any suggestion of hedonism or style.</p>
        <p>Contrasting such stereotypes of French and Russian culture, Mr. Mamin makes his countrymen the butt of an extended, wistful joke. His film asks what would happen to Russians who could suddenly escape their impoverished society and find themselves in the midst of French culture, which they regard with a mixture of suspicion, envy and disbelief.</p>

        <p>The drawing seen at the start of Yuri Mamin's "Window to Paris" looks like a charming French street scene, but it disintegrates before the viewer's very eyes. As the picture comes to life, stylized Gallic gaiety gives way to Russian reality, with drab colors, clumsy buffoonery, a circus atmosphere and a long line for vodka destroying any suggestion of hedonism or style.</p>
        <p>Contrasting such stereotypes of French and Russian culture, Mr. Mamin makes his countrymen the butt of an extended, wistful joke. His film asks what would happen to Russians who could suddenly escape their impoverished society and find themselves in the midst of French culture, which they regard with a mixture of suspicion, envy and disbelief.</p>
        <p>"Who protected them from the Tartar Mongols?" one of the film's Russian characters asks belligerently, once the "Twilight Zone"-type device of the title lets them step directly from St. Petersburg to a rooftop within view of the Eiffel Tower. "We held them back for 200 years. Meanwhile, they" -- the French -- "evolved."</p>
        <p>"Window to Paris," a buffoonish culture-clash comedy with a broadly sentimental streak, relies on similar French-Russian disparities as its only sure-fire source of wit, though Mr. Mamin doesn't explore his premise cleverly enough to keep the film steadily aloft. Alongside the occasional droll comparison of national temperments, there's also quite a bit of silliness involving a pretty French taxidermist whose studio happens to look out on the magic window. Language barrier gags abound, as do scenes juxtaposing boorish, drunken Russians with the haughtier, more self-possessed French. The film maker's ideas about both nations remain unsurprising, since they're fully apparent from the very start.</p>
        <p>"Window to Paris," which opens today at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, stars Sergei Dontsov as Nikolai, the clownish, sad-sack music teacher who accidentally stumbles across the gateway to French culture. Assigned to a crowded, boisterous apartment where the residents store groceries inside their several pianos, he is given the room of a recently deceased old woman, who kept models of Parisian landmarks as part of her decor. It's typical of the film's coarse comic style that this old woman appears not as a mysterious, ghostly figure but as one more cantankerous character on an already-crowded scene. Not surprising, the escape hatch out of Russia has great allure.</p>
        <p>Soon Nikolai and his neighbors are making regular trips across time and space, managing to get so drunk in the process that it takes them a while to grasp the magnitude of their adventure. Once the drunk jokes subside and the premise sinks in, Mr. Mamin himself has nowhere to go, and the film begins taking weightlessly farcical turns. Eventually, it reaches a moment of sufficient toothlessness for Nikolai to tell his music students: "You were born at the wrong time in a miserable, bankrupt country. But it's still your country. Can't you make it a better place?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Mamin, whose film making is more spirited than accomplished, doesn't do much to further that cause. The film's Russia-bashing culminates in a bleak interlude when the French taxidermist finds herself passing through the looking glass and getting nightmarishly stuck in St. Petersburg. Unlike tougher Russian directors like Pavel Lungine ("Taxi Blues"), Mr. Mamin doesn't take a bitter, scorching view of his country's troubles, preferring instead to poke gentle fun and look on the sunny side. By the time "Window to Paris" is over, songs and balloons and sweetness have supplanted any possible sting.
