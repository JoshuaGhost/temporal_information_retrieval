        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although some may feel that enough has been said about House Majority Leader Dick Armey's use of the slur "fag" against Representative Barney Frank, the most troubling issue is what has not been said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armey constructs an adamant defense in a righteously indignant letter (Jan. 30). However, in explaining the detailed intricacies of a "slip," he fails to condemn anti-gay sentiments without exception.</p>
        <p>On the day the world commemorated the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, an atrocity painfully remembered as the consequence of hatred and intolerance, it is particularly ironic and offensive that Dick Armey would publicly use the slur "fag."</p>
        <p>Although these two events have been separated by 50 years, they are inextricably connected by their essential cores: politically and publicly espoused hatred and bigotry.</p>
        <p>There is an insidious link between anti-gay slurs and violence against gay men and lesbians.</p>
        <p>Since April 1993, there have been eight brutal murders of gay men in Dick Armey's home state of Texas, yet he fails to address the serious implications of hate toward gay people.</p>
        <p>Gay men and lesbians face an increased threat to our lives and well-being for fear of hostility and violence everywhere we turn -- from the streets of our neighborhoods to our jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Armey owes an unqualified apology not only to Mr. Frank but also to all gay men and lesbians, who must now endure the consequence of his deliberate refusal to declare publicly that bigotry and hatred is a path the world cannot afford to take again. RICHARD BURNS  Executive Director, Lesbian &amp; Gay Community Services Center New York, Jan. 30, 1995</p>
