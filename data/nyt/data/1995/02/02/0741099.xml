        <p>One might think it a pretty straightforward act, toting up car and light-truck sales.</p>
        <p>But many of the world's auto makers tried to tally their January sales today, and the result was chaos that made it impossible to determine for sure if the market is headed up, down or sideways.</p>
        <p>The auto makers could not even agree on how many days last month their dealers' showrooms were open. Subaru said there were 24 sales days. Mitsubishi said there were 26 sales days. Honda counted 25. And Ford said it would not report its sales until Friday.</p>
        <p>The confusion could not come at a worse time. Investors are already nervous because of ambiguous signs that the auto market is softening. As vehicle sales data, once a venerable economic indicator, disintegrated, analysts were left groping for some sign of the market's condition, and grappling with something of an existential crisis.</p>
        <p>"I don't know what to believe," said John Casesa, auto analyst with Wertheim, Schroder &amp; Company in New York. "You're probably going to ask me how I'm going to analyze this stuff, and I have no idea."</p>
        <p>Early today, the Ford Motor Company said it earned a record $1.56 billion in the fourth quarter. That meant the Big Three made more money in 1994 -- almost $14 billion -- than ever before.  [ Page D3. ]</p>
        <p>Also today, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates again, confident the economy is growing too fast for its taste. But all one could infer with certainty from January's vehicle sales is that auto makers badly need to polish their green eyeshades.</p>
        <p>January sales figures became blurry because most auto makers changed the way they report sales. They switched from reporting on the third business day of the month to reporting on the first business day, today. The auto makers that switched say they did so because computerized systems allow them to report faster.</p>
        <p>But those that did not make the switch say that sales reports from dealers can take several days to trickle in after the sales are made. That means the auto makers probably failed to count some sales from the last days of January.</p>
        <p>Still, no one knows how bad the undercount is. Both the General Motors Corporation and the Chrysler Corporation switched to the new system, and both said that sales fell during the month. But it was difficult to determine how much of the shortfall was caused by too few customers and how much by too few reporting days.</p>
        <p>Ford, which did not switch, predicted today that when it does release its numbers, they will show sales increased in January. The Nissan Motor Company was the other major auto maker to hold out against the new system.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Toyota Motor Corporation said that its January sales rose strongly. But perhaps the company did even better than it thinks.</p>
        <p>"There's too much noise in these numbers, and it would do more harm than good to try to draw any conclusions from them," said Harvey Heinbach, auto analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York. He said he preferred to ignore them, but "I realize the market's not going to let us."</p>
        <p>The reason the stock market is so insistent is that investors are desperate for a clear sense of what is happening in auto showrooms. Auto makers have been increasing rebates and cutting production, possible signs of softening demand. There's no indicator of actual demand, however, like sales.</p>
        <p>The reporting change is likely to distort January sales reports most egregiously. In future months, however, the sales numbers will still not be truly comparable to the previous year's results.</p>
        <p>Faced with this confusion, analysts sought guidance from dealers. The trouble was that they offered no consensus. Sales "weren't as good as last January, and not as good as they should be," said Linda Schwarz, new car sales manager at Integrity Chevrolet-Geo in Parma Heights, Ohio. She blamed rising interest rates for the slowdown.</p>
        <p>Other dealers said the rates were not biting yet, and that any apparent softness in the market was normal for the winter. "We're about 5 percent up over last January," said Manly Eubank, president of Palmetto Ford in Charleston, S.C. "January and February are typically slow."</p>
        <p>Caveats aside, G.M. said today that its vehicle sales in January fell 5.5 percent, to 329,515. While cars fell 11.6 percent, G.M. said, trucks gained 4.0 percent. At Chrysler, vehicle sales slipped 6 percent, to 148,638, with light trucks dropping by 9 percent while cars fell by 1 percent.</p>
        <p>Honda's sales slipped 5.6 percent, to 46,442. But Toyota said its sales soared by 18.5 percent, to 79,717. Mazda said its sales plunged 23.8 percent, to 18,860.</p>
