        <p>"When he arrived here," Bill Mott was saying, "there was no tag or label on him warning us that he was special. You know, this is Genuine Reward, the colt that Genuine Risk foaled when she was 16 years old. So, be careful. But we knew who he was."</p>
        <p>"You try not to show favoritism," he went on. "But you're always aware that a lot of people will be looking at him. You give him a good groom, somebody who's been with us a long time. You get him a good rider. You see he's a good-feeling colt with curiosity and personality. He'll jump around and play."</p>
        <p>"But there's no label. You don't even know if he can run fast. Nobody has put a clock on him yet. But you know that he's special."</p>
        <p>The special colt, a light red 2-year-old chestnut, was led out of his stall earlier this week at Payson Park, about a two-hour drive north of Mott's highly successful racing string at Gulfstream Park. It is a campus setting where selected horses spend the winter and spring in a serene setting with long grass, soft dirt and all the comforts of life in the country. Saratoga south.</p>
        <p>For Genuine Reward, this was Phase 2 of his training to become a race horse. Phase 1 came last autumn at the 400-acre Newstead Farm of his owners, Diana and Bert Firestone, in Upperville in the fashionable Virginia countryside. He learned to walk with a long rein, to wear tack, to carry a rider on his back, to get used to seeing an iron gate, to run around an oval track with other yearlings.</p>
        <p>He arrived at Payson Park in the middle of December for Phase 2: Life in a race track setting under a big-league trainer. He will soon start 60 days of breezing, working out a measured cadence, a notch up from a gallop: first one furlong, then two furlongs, then three. He will carry a jockey. He will start from the gate alongside other horses. On May 1, he will either stay behind at Payson or accompany other bright prospects to Saratoga to await the rest of Mott's brood. And in August or September, he will at long last march to the post for his debut.</p>
        <p>"He is bright and curious," Mott said, "and playful, even cocky, a little arrogant. He knows he's supposed to get special attention. He is already under tack, and he will continue to gallop around the track here, day by day, and in a few days we will start breezing him.</p>
        <p>"Will we put a clock on him? Not seriously. We'll gradually wind him up for his first race.</p>
        <p>"When will we get our first clue that he can run? We won't, other than that he moves well, he's a little aggressive, he has spirit. He's athletic enough that he gallops nicely. If he's sound, if he's going to race at 2, we'd like to get him ready by August."</p>
        <p>"But," he concluded with the fatalism of the race track, "we won't actually know if he can race -- until he races."</p>
        <p>Genuine Reward was not only special when he arrived at Payson Park two and a half months ago, he was probably the most famous yearling in America. His mother won the 1980 Kentucky Derby, then endured 13 years of miscarriages and misfortunes before giving birth to a chestnut colt on May 15, 1993.</p>
        <p>The foal, who was sired by the European mile star Rahy, was named Genuine Reward by the Firestones, who also own and keep Genuine Risk at their Virginia farm. The letters and calls have slowed down, but the visitors still keep making the pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>In the middle of December, the chestnut colt was shipped to Mott, who trains the Firestone horses, a young professional from South Dakota who saddled the turf champion Paradise Creek and who regularly leads the list of winners. To many, he is the next great American trainer.</p>
        <p>Genuine Reward came with no label. But he did, however, come down a few days later with a cough. Dave Wallace, the assistant trainer who stays at Payson while Mott races at Gulfstream, said: "The cough went through all the horses." Genuine Reward recovered, went into light training in his new setting, then the cough surfaced again. But now he seems clear of it, and he is back in training to learn the ways of a race horse.</p>
        <p>Wallace put on a helmet, hopped onto Genuine Reward's back and walked the colt leisurely around the barn, time after time, staying under the shed row. Then Wallace called out to a groom to "turn him out." The groom led the horse into the sunshine to a nearby field, where Genuine Reward was turned loose for the afternoon. He circled the paddock, kicked his heels, nibbled the top slat of the wooden fence, showed interest in a horse in the next field, then found some sand and rolled around on his back for a while.</p>
        <p>"He's a 24-hour personality," Wallace said. "Before he started to cough, he'd go to the track to jog with two other horses, then he'd gallop three-eighths of a mile every couple of days. We'd tack on an extra furlong.</p>
        <p>"It's another phase of his learning, doing the same thing he was doing in Virginia under the direction of Barbara Graham. He's already broken. He's had a rider. He's run with other horses. Now, there's gate work and breezing and getting him ready for the races, day by day.</p>
        <p>"If he's ready to go to Saratoga on May 1, fine. If not, he may stay here. The horse tells you when he's ready."</p>
        <p>Genuine Reward, who is bigger and heavier than he was last autumn, looks to be slightly on the small side to Wallace. But he's smart.</p>
        <p>"Sometimes," he said, "you think he's too smart for his own good. He doesn't realize he's getting carried away. He's a good learner, too. He's had a lot of attention."</p>
        <p>But can he run?</p>
        <p>"He's got a good way of galloping," Wallace said, hedging his bet while Genuine Reward frolicked in the grass, unbeaten and untried.</p>
