        <p>President Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon's long-governing party suffered its worst defeat ever in elections in the western Mexican state of Jalisco last week, though some of his aides considered it the best of possible outcomes.</p>
        <p>That was because a closer and less obvious result would have placed Mr. Zedillo, who has pledged himself to democratic reform, in another potentially volatile showdown against forces within his party that are less inclined to accept elections as real contests for power.</p>
        <p>In such a confrontation last month in the southern state of Tabasco, Mr. Zedillo intervened to force his party's newly elected governor to step down after protests of fraud by the leftist opposition brought outright rebellion. Turning against the President, the governor's supporters nearly paralyzed business and transportation in the state, forcing Mr. Zedillo to back down.</p>
        <p>The economic crisis that has followed Mr. Zedillo's devaluation of the peso probably sealed the fate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in Jalisco. And the landslide of the party called the PAN may be a portent of things to come. Over the next 10 months, the governing party faces stiff challenges in five more state elections around the country.
