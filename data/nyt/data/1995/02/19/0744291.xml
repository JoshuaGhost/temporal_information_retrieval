        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Harvey Ginsberg's lively portrait of William Maxwell ("A Modest, Scrupulous, Happy Man," Jan. 22) is a welcome corrective to Mary Flanagan's sapless review of "All the Days and Nights," Mr. Maxwell's collected stories, in the same issue. Her obtuse inventory of subjects he does not cover reveals, though evidently without her awareness or approval, how thoroughly this consummate artist has spent his writing life instinctively avoiding cliches and fashionable trends. He has given, in both his stories and his novels, only the purest testimony of the eye, the heart and the mind.</p>

        <p>Ms. Flanagan, of course, sees what she sees and hears what she hears, but there are others, and I am one of them, who find every essential of human life in Mr. Maxwell's work, and who know of no other voice in contemporary American fiction as inexhaustibly confiding, funny, tender, delicate, wise and true as his.
