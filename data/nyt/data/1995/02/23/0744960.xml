        <p>The Governments of Ireland and Britain have taken a bold step toward peace in Northern Ireland. They released a joint document outlining a framework for resolving the bloody conflict of the last 25 years. The framework is not binding, but is merely a set of suggestions any party to further discussions can accept or reject. As a road map for the next steps toward peace, it is reasonable and fair to all sides.</p>
        <p>The document's main purpose is to initiate a democratic process for deciding the fate of Northern Ireland. It recognizes that both unionists and republicans will have to make difficult compromises. It proposes steps to guarantee that no change will come about without the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland. At the same time it would amend the Irish Constitution to forgo its historical claim to the six northern counties.</p>

        <p>The Governments of Ireland and Britain have taken a bold step toward peace in Northern Ireland. They released a joint document outlining a framework for resolving the bloody conflict of the last 25 years. The framework is not binding, but is merely a set of suggestions any party to further discussions can accept or reject. As a road map for the next steps toward peace, it is reasonable and fair to all sides.</p>
        <p>The document's main purpose is to initiate a democratic process for deciding the fate of Northern Ireland. It recognizes that both unionists and republicans will have to make difficult compromises. It proposes steps to guarantee that no change will come about without the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland. At the same time it would amend the Irish Constitution to forgo its historical claim to the six northern counties.</p>
        <p>So far, Irish republican leaders have been more receptive to the new framework than have Protestant leaders -- even though it represents huge compromises for Ireland and for Republicans. In contrast, the Rev. Ian Paisley, head of the Democratic Unionist Party, declared the document a nightmare. This is not surprising; Mr. Paisley, who represents the most extreme wing of Protestant Unionism, has built his political career on intransigence. James Molyneaux, whose Ulster Unionist Party is the biggest Protestant body, was less withering but still highly wary.</p>
        <p>The British Government has wisely decided to print 600,000 copies of the document so that citizens of Northern Ireland can see for themselves what it contains, rather than being swayed by the characterizations of their political leaders. Extremist leaders in Northern Ireland, unless they learn to change quickly, may soon find themselves obsolete. If they refuse even to discuss measures that would allow all citizens an equal voice in their future, they will paint themselves -- quite accurately -- as demagogues.</p>
        <p>This document represents a rare chance to let go of old hatreds. All over the world -- from Cambodia to El Salvador to the Middle East -- old enemies are struggling in this direction. The citizens of Northern Ireland deserve no less.</p>
