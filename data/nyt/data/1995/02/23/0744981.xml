        <p>Pat Riley finally mustered up the courage to admit today, "It's all or nothing this year."</p>
        <p>Just what inspired the coach's candor was debatable. Maybe it was watching his team suffer an embarrassing 99-91 loss to the undermanned Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, or maybe it was the presence of Charles Oakley back at practice today. But Riley certainly sounded like a man in the fourth year of a five-year contract with no new agreement in place.</p>

        <p>Pat Riley finally mustered up the courage to admit today, "It's all or nothing this year."</p>
        <p>Just what inspired the coach's candor was debatable. Maybe it was watching his team suffer an embarrassing 99-91 loss to the undermanned Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, or maybe it was the presence of Charles Oakley back at practice today. But Riley certainly sounded like a man in the fourth year of a five-year contract with no new agreement in place.</p>
        <p>Riley's team was outhustled and outrebounded by Cleveland the same way it has been outworked by lesser opponents on numerous occasions this season, and the coach spoke with great concern about the Knicks' preparation and focus heading toward the playoffs.</p>
        <p>In a victory over the Miami Heat last Friday, Riley seemed to reach a boiling point, stating angrily that the Knicks had the most "unprofessional" attitude he had seen in his 15 years of coaching in the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>While Riley's words were not so sharp today, they cut through the heart of his team just the same.</p>
        <p>"When you become a team that begins to think about other things instead of what you have to do as a team, and you're above listening and really applying what we're trying to do as a team, it manifests itself out on the court in a lack of execution," Riley said. "Then you are doing yourself an injustice."</p>
        <p>As he spoke, Riley sounded as if he had already conceded the Atlantic Division title to the Orlando Magic, which is six and one-half games ahead of his second-place Knicks. He put the emphasis firmly on how the Knicks must perform in the playoffs, and made no mistake that he was talking about this year's playoffs.</p>
        <p>"It's all or nothing, but in a very positive way," said Riley, who had the Knicks watch an hour of film today before putting them through two hours of practice drills. "When it's all said and done, and the smoke clears and we add it all up, whether we're second or third, that'll be all right. If you take that approach, it doesn't matter where you finish."</p>
        <p>In four of the last five games, the Knicks have been outrebounded by the opposition. New York was outrebounded (34-33) by a Cleveland team that was minus five of its top players, including Mark Price and Tyrone Hill.</p>
        <p>Oakley, who has been out of action since undergoing surgery on Dec. 27 to repair his dislocated right toe, was a welcome sight as he jogged onto the practice floor.</p>
        <p>"I'm just glad I can come back and contribute," Oakley said. "I'm going to do what I can and try to keep the wagon rolling."</p>
        <p>While Oakley indicated he would probably miss Thursday night's game against the Sacramento Kings at Madison Square Garden, he did suggest that he might be back for Sunday night's home game against Philadelphia, or more importantly, next Tuesday night's contest at Orlando.</p>
        <p>"Yeah, I'd like to play against Orlando," Oakley said. "But I just don't know."</p>
        <p>Although the Knicks have played fairly well in Oakley's absence, Riley knows his team would have little chance in the post-season without their best power forward.</p>
        <p>"You go on this extended honeymoon and then the reality begins to hit in certain areas," Riley said. "Offensive rebounds are a big example of that. We don't make a real concerted effort to get rebounds, we're 23d in the league in that department."</p>
        <p>With Oakley and Herb Williams back from injuries, Riley was asked if the Knicks could defeat Orlando come playoff time.</p>
        <p>"I think we've proven that when we're right and healthy and tough, we can beat anybody," Riley said. "I want to win and I think the players want to win. It's the only thing you play for. I couldn't fathom playing for anything else."  PRO BASKETBALL</p>
