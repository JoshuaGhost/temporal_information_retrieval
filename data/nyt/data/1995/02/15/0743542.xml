        <p>The release by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of his preliminary spending plan is the beginning of a long process by which the New York City government determines its budget for the 1996 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The plan, which is required by the City Charter, gives projections of spending and revenue for the next four years, but its details focus primarily on the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Beginning March 8, budget officials and agency heads will appear before City Council committees to discuss details of their initial proposal. In addition, Mr.  Giuliani and his aides -- as well as City Council leaders -- are expected to lobby state legislators over the next two months concerning the Mayor's proposals for changes in Medicaid and welfare financing and other matters that require state approval.</p>

        <p>The release by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of his preliminary spending plan is the beginning of a long process by which the New York City government determines its budget for the 1996 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. The plan, which is required by the City Charter, gives projections of spending and revenue for the next four years, but its details focus primarily on the next fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Beginning March 8, budget officials and agency heads will appear before City Council committees to discuss details of their initial proposal. In addition, Mr.  Giuliani and his aides -- as well as City Council leaders -- are expected to lobby state legislators over the next two months concerning the Mayor's proposals for changes in Medicaid and welfare financing and other matters that require state approval.</p>
        <p>In late April, the Mayor will propose his final spending plan, called the executive budget. That plan will take into account any new state aid and the reaction to his preliminary plan, as well as changes in revenue and spending estimates during the first five months of the year. It then goes to the Council for a second round of committee hearings.</p>
        <p>Finally, in early June, the Mayor and the Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, will begin negotiations on the final details of the budget. These talks sometimes last for a week or more, and they are followed by a final vote by the full Council.</p>
        <p>But as the city showed with its 1995 budget, the process does not necessarily end there. If the revenue assumptions in the final budget do not hold up, the city will have to make additional cuts through the 1996 fiscal year.  GIULIANI'S SPENDING PLAN</p>
