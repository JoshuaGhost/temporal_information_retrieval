        <p>Pamela Wax wore an enormous smile as she inched across Prospect Park's Long Meadow on her brand-new cross-country skis. Last winter, she had gone to ski store after ski store but all the beginner's skis were sold out. This year, she bought early, and then it didn't snow.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wax is a rabbi, and hastened to say she was headed for the synagogue as soon as she finished skiing. "I'm so excited," she said.</p>

        <p>Pamela Wax wore an enormous smile as she inched across Prospect Park's Long Meadow on her brand-new cross-country skis. Last winter, she had gone to ski store after ski store but all the beginner's skis were sold out. This year, she bought early, and then it didn't snow.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wax is a rabbi, and hastened to say she was headed for the synagogue as soon as she finished skiing. "I'm so excited," she said.</p>
        <p>Snow transformed Brooklyn fundamentally, as it did the entire region. At Sheepshead Bay, an hour before sunrise, nobody was getting the fishing boats ready to go out. Only one person, Steve Orlando, was visible, puttering around. He said the ocean had been as smooth as a lake on Friday, and the mackerel were almost jumping into the sleek boat.</p>
        <p>"The bad thing isn't the snow," Mr. Orlando said. "It's the wind behind it."</p>
        <p>On the streets of Sheepshead Bay a woman walked a Doberman who hated every step in the cold snow. "I guess he ain't no sled dog," she said with a lilting laugh.</p>
        <p>Come dawn at Coney Island, the steel gray sky oozed into an even grayer ocean. Snowflakes swirled about, creating the appearance of a thousand pure white tornadoes. On the boardwalk, where multitudes mill in summertime, there was a single set of foot tracks and no one in sight.</p>
        <p>Back at Prospect Park, Owen McDonagh, 8, was pitilessly mushing his father, Tony, to pull him through the sticky snow. He had two new sleds, after all.</p>
        <p>Said Owen: "It's fun. It's cold." Said Mr. McDonagh, an electrician: "He pestered us all to get out of bed -- starting at 7 A.M." On the Sled Front</p>
        <p>On Friday, the forecasts of snow launched a demand for sleds that yesterday just kept, er, snowballing. Mary Arnold Toys, at 962 Lexington Avenue near 70th Street, was selling old-fashioned Flexible Flyers, snow saucers and "snowboggans" to throngs eager to pay up to $80 for a steel-runner sled.</p>
        <p>"We thought we had been cursed," said the store's manager, Linda Arnold. "The minute we ordered, there were no more forecasts of snow."</p>
        <p>But after months of sitting in the window, apparently unnoticed, sleds were suddenly zipping out of the store. And Ms. Arnold insisted the satisfaction transcended profit.</p>
        <p>"When you can slide down a hill, with the snow blowing in your face, it's the best feeling," she said. "It's a feeling you can't buy." The Unfriendly Snowplow</p>
        <p>Some people eagerly await the arrival of snowplows -- and some don't. In Ridgewood, N.J., Mary Greene was mad. Twice yesterday morning, the snow removal trucks blocked her driveway as they deposited snow from an adjacent street.</p>
        <p>The first time it took Miss Greene an hour and a half to remove the additional drift, and an hour later she was working to remove a second.</p>
        <p>"I drove after the truck and stopped him and asked if he'd please take his snow somewhere else, but they guy just said, 'Yeah, yeah,' " she said.</p>
        <p>Miss Greene was about to mount a cardboard sign at the top of her driveway that would say, "Don't Leave Snow Here."  No Insurance</p>
        <p>Then there is the case of Torrington, Conn., one of several Connecticut communities that bought snow insurance for the first time this year. For $25,000, the policy pays snow-removal costs after a deductible of four snowfalls.</p>
        <p>Matthew Dominy, the Director of Public Works, thought the policy was a swell way of avoiding the cost overruns of nearly $200,000 in each of the last two years. But it was being constantly pointed out to him that it had not snowed and might never do so.</p>
        <p>"This is a step in the right direction," he said with obvious relief. "It makes this look like a smarter investment. If everything works out, I'm going to be the gambling guru of the city of Torrington."</p>
        <p>On the other side of this coin is a company that writes this sort of insurance, though not Torrington's. "We're pretty nervous," said Pat Sleicher, an executive of Worldwide Weather, a weather insurer. Back to Basics</p>
        <p>A winter storm turns people's thoughts to the basics: clothes and food. From sidewalk mitten sellers to the fancy sweater shops, people were buying warmth.</p>
        <p>At the Ritz Thrift Shop, at 105 West 57th Street, which sells used furs, people were suddenly rushing in to take their minks out of storage. The manager, Peter Jacobs, said he expected the next step would be more sales. "It's always nice to have cold weather in the fur industry," he said.</p>
        <p>At the Gourmet Garage, which sells a variety of epicurean delights at 453 Broome Street in SoHo, fear of the storm drove mothers with babies in strollers to stock up on milk. Other big sellers were such soup ingredients as dried chili peppers and numerous varieties of beans. But go figure this one: ice cream sales were triple the normal level. Variations on Warmth</p>
        <p>A stark prescence against the pristine background were New York's homeless. They huddled in boxes and makeshift shelters and tried to stay warm. At midmorning, Robert Rice, 48, lay under two blankets across from the United Nations.</p>
        <p>"I'm warm," he said. "I've got a coat and a scarf and a face mask. I'm alright."</p>
        <p>Huddled under his various layers of cloth, Mr. Rice's face was invisible. He said he had been homeless for 13 years and had learned a few things.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rice's favorite thing about winter is remembering the fun he had throwing snowballs as a boy.</p>
        <p>At the Russian Turkish baths at 268 East 10th Street, people started streaming in at the time the doors opened at 7 A.M.</p>
        <p>Bathers in the hottest chamber were bringing in buckets of snow to rub on their steaming bodies. Some threw snowballs. The boldest ran outside and rolled in the snow.</p>
        <p>A customer, Angel Rivera, had a very practical reason why he had come to the deliciously infernal space. "I didn't want to shovel snow," he said. "I'm hoping it melts by the time I get out."</p>
