        <p>ALTHOUGH much of the state and national spotlight has focused on Westchester's success with its workfare program as a means of achieving welfare reform, there are other elements of the county's social services initiatives that are being studied as potential models.</p>
        <p>A program known as Front-End Detection, which has been in operation for the last five years, was intended to screen more effectively applications for public assistance. Under this program, social service field investigators assess applicants' actual need for assistance, as part of an overall effort to reduce possible fraud. Existing Home Relief cases are also investigated regularly to determine continuing need.</p>
        <p>In a related effort, the county's Social Services Department also runs computer matches of its recipient files with other databases, like Internal Revenue Service and unemployment, to determine other sources of income. "This computer system acts in an efficient way so that all incomes are fully accounted for," said Joseph Hogan, deputy commissioner of the county's Social Services Department.</p>
        <p>To help women move away from public assistance, the county has also been running a program known as MOMS (Mothers on the Move) for the last few years. Women who are receiving Aid to Dependent Children are eligible to enroll in this two-year college program. Courses are offered at Westchester Community College in Valhalla and the Pace University campus in White Plains. Program participants take classes in specifically targeted marketable areas, like computer and medical technician skills, and are given follow-up placement counseling to find jobs. "Significant numbers of these women are now working and are off welfare," Mr. Hogan said.</p>
        <p>Through the use of more specialized residences for homeless families, which provide those families with counseling, training and other services, the county has been able to reduce its spending in this area, to $46.3 million last year from $60.3 million in 1990.</p>
        <p>And as an example of the county's continuing effort to make the delivery of social services more efficient and economical, the county recently opened a one-stop district office in Yonkers, where the city's 14,000 clients can receive all services. MERRI ROSENBERG</p>
