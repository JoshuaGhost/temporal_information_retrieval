        <p>TO say Athena in Bellmore is a Greek storefront is like calling the Empire State a tall building. Yes, the newcomer next to a Chinese takeout on Merrick Road clearly fits the definition of storefront. But its exceptional food and charming look incorporating classical architectural features and masses of green plants set it apart.</p>
        <p>Cream-colored walls are outlined with a white chair rail in the Greek key pattern. Near the ceiling a wallpaper frieze of Greek vases encircles the room. Doric and Ionic columns are everywhere, in pictures, as plant stands and as wood carvings affixed to the wall. Tables with the look of green marble mesh with the Hellenic style.</p>

        <p>TO say Athena in Bellmore is a Greek storefront is like calling the Empire State a tall building. Yes, the newcomer next to a Chinese takeout on Merrick Road clearly fits the definition of storefront. But its exceptional food and charming look incorporating classical architectural features and masses of green plants set it apart.</p>
        <p>Cream-colored walls are outlined with a white chair rail in the Greek key pattern. Near the ceiling a wallpaper frieze of Greek vases encircles the room. Doric and Ionic columns are everywhere, in pictures, as plant stands and as wood carvings affixed to the wall. Tables with the look of green marble mesh with the Hellenic style.</p>
        <p>The food at Athena is as striking as its decor. Greek snack-bar favorites are available along with more adventuresome and sophisticated fare.</p>
        <p>The two must-order appetizers are shrimp Cleopatra and saganaki. Four warm jumbo shrimp are presented atop a salad tossed in a smashing dressing of olive oil, lemon, capers and feta cheese. The saganaki, a melt of kaseri and feta cheese, herbs and tomatoes, is made texturally exciting by intertwined chewy pita crisps.</p>
        <p>Skordalia, a heady potato-garlic mixture, and baba gannouj, the eggplant spread, are other super openers. They are garnished with olives, cucumbers, tomatoes, a hot pepper and onion slices and are accompanied by warm rounds of pita. Taramosalata, Greek red caviar, tasted strong. Greek pizzas and spanakopita, or spinach pie, were standard.</p>
        <p>Every entree arrives with a choice of soup or salad, and both are far above par. The salad is a generous crunchy delight with a vibrant fresh dill flavor.</p>
        <p>The soup of the day on two occasions was called potato-dill but was different on each try. One night it was creamy with chunks of potato and snippets of dill. On another the potatoes and dill were joined by other vegetables in a clear broth. Both were excellent. The avgolemono, or chicken-rice soup laced with lemon juice, is a good version of the classic soothing brew.</p>
        <p>Shrimp ran away with laurels at entree time, just as it did at the beginning of the meal. Shrimp Ikaros, consisting of firm jumbos sauteed with olive oil, basil, garlic, red wine and a touch of cream, is a memorable creation. Shrimp Santorini mated with spinach, feta cheese, zucchini and mushrooms is a bit overwhelmed by its accompaniments. A special of moist salmon wrapped in flaky phyllo pastry and paired with a creamy dill sauce elicited bravos.</p>
        <p>Veal dishes featured fork-tender cutlets. Veal Mediterranean in a lip-smacking wine sauce dotted with sun-dried tomatoes and mushrooms was the favorite at our table. Veal lemonaki in a zingy white-wine-and-lemon sauce also made points.  Other good picks are the tasty vegetarian moussaka and the chicken Meli, a moist breast stuffed with eggplant and cheese in a red sauce vibrant with garlic.</p>
        <p>If the mixed grill is an evening special, try it. It is a triple treat of well-seasoned gyro meat, a butterflied grilled Greek sausage and a juicy tender veal shish kebab.</p>
        <p>Desserts are homemade and delicious. A moist raspberry-hazelnut cake glazed with chocolate took first place. Traditionalists will like the baklava set atop its honey syrup. Chocolate lovers should sample the chocolate baklava, a rolled confection studded with chocolate chips.</p>
        <p>The restaurant did not have a liquor license at the time of my visits.</p>
        <p>Athena is a Greek gem. Its earnest hard-working staff, lovely surroundings, flavor-packed food and even its takeout packages and doggie bags, tied with ribbons, make it special.  Athena</p>
