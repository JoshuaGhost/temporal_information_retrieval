        <p>NANCY SMITH has a two-line telephone, right by her bed, that can handle conference calls. She has a laptop computer. She has a boss who leaves anxious-sounding voice-mail messages. She also has the flu.</p>
        <p>So she compromised: she stayed home one day last week, but took part in a meeting on the phone. The problem was, the conference-call connection had the fidelity of a subway public-address announcement.</p>
        <p>"I was feeling the pressure of having a lot of things to catch up on," said Ms. Smith, a consumer affairs manager for AT&amp;T in Basking Ridge, N.J. "But it was hard for me to catch what was being said. The little snatches that I could hear made me think it was very interesting, but I eventually gave up."</p>
        <p>The flu that has hit the East Coast this winter seems to be making people sicker than in previous years, and for longer. Stalwart workaholics who insist that they never come down with more than a 36-hour bug have missed entire weeks of work. To be at home for that long is to risk life-changing revelations. Yes, your apartment really is a mess. Yes, you may lose a few clients for being in bed instead of at their meetings. Yes, you are stuck in a lousy job with a monomaniacal boss who should be told off in no uncertain terms.</p>
        <p>But despite triple-digit fevers and megadoses of antibiotics, the old fear sets in.</p>
        <p>"In today's economy, with companies being downsized all the time, there's a real concern about not appearing weak," said Joseph R. Weintraub, a professor of management and organizational behavior at Babson College in Wellesley, Mass. "You don't want to acknowledge you may be ill or, if you are, you can't function. Even if you can't get in to work because you can't stand up for longer than three minutes, you still try to get things done from home."</p>
        <p>This applies to those who do the downsizing -- namely, bosses -- as well as those farther down the organizational pyramid. Penny Glazier, an owner of several Manhattan restaurants, missed four nights of table-hopping and two days in the office. But miss work? Not a chance.</p>
        <p>"I dragged myself into the room at home where I have a fax machine and tried to take care of paperwork," she said. "I felt so far removed from what was going on that it was difficult to stay in bed and not constantly be thinking about what I was supposed to be doing. I had a big breakfast meeting planned. We were inviting all these event planners from major corporations. I had the sales kit on my mind, and in the end I did it over the fax machine."</p>
        <p>Ms. Glazier is not alone. Some flu sufferers live for the four or five hours when they can get something -- anything -- done.</p>
        <p>"Being able to work was an important part of the recuperation," said Christopher W. Hunt, the editor in chief of Workplace America, a newsletter that follows employment trends. He was out sick for a week. "As long as you pace yourself and yet know that work's getting done, that makes you feel better," he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert Campbell, the medical director of Gracie Square Hospital in Manhattan, said that hard-driving flu sufferers face the usual dilemma -- "whether to give in to the illness or to push themselves and try to do, inadequately, the work they shouldn't be doing." But the longer recuperation period this year presents a different problem.</p>
        <p>"They've got all this time, so they think they should be happy, or at least relieved," he said. "But they really do feel sick, and that interferes with their ability to watch television, to appreciate humor. They don't have the attention span, they fall asleep in the middle of it. They just aren't accustomed to that, and that throws them for a loop."</p>
        <p>People who fall sick while on business trips are thrown for an even bigger loop: a day cooped up in a strange hotel room in a strange city goes by slowly, as Gail J. Franck, a management consultant from Manhattan, discovered when she came down with the flu in Boston.</p>
        <p>"I would basically sleep for four hours, do four hours of work, or try to, and sleep for hours and hours," she said. After four days, she felt well enough to go home. On the fifth day, she slogged into the office and quickly lost her voice.</p>
        <p>"All you want to do is have your mom come and take care of you," she said, "but your mom doesn't have two weeks to do that. Everybody that you talk to is happy to commiserate and tell you they had it and share their home remedies."</p>
        <p>Home remedies? Diana David was so unaccustomed to spending a week in her apartment that she began working on remedies for her home. "It's in a sorry state of neglect, as are homes of people who are married to their jobs," she said of her apartment on the Upper West Side. "Every time my temperature went down, I'd start cleaning the windows, but slowly." She called a cleaning service to tackle her dirt-encrusted Venetian blinds where, she said, "the dirt weighs more than the blinds."</p>
        <p>Even home-repair people have been at home. Dennis Michaels, a contractor in Manhattan, took two days off. "The first day, you're so upset, you just throw the TV on because that's the easiest thing," he said. "After a couple of hours, you're even more disgusted. It's all talk shows. When you were a kid, TV was more fun. The second day, you switch to books, but you're constantly thinking, 'When am I going to get better? One more day? Two more days?' The third day, I went out and tried to do the things I was supposed to do, and ended up back in bed."</p>
        <p>Frank English, a photographer for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad, said that the hardest part of his weeklong convalescence was not being able to talk about the flu.</p>
        <p>"You feel like you're at one with everybody because you're sick with the same bug, but you can't share your fear," he said. "It seems overwrought. You don't want to go to the emergency room, because there are people there who really need help. And you can't call your doctor because what is he going to tell you? It would be good to get some clarification, but by the time they can do a culture and figure out what the bug is, it will probably be gone."</p>
