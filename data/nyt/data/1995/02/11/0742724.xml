        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Jailed Algerian Issues Warning About Election" (news article, Feb. 2) plants doubts as to the actual perpetrators of the murderous car bomb at Algiers. You refer to a Jan. 27 letter by Ali Belhadj, co-leader of the banned Islamic Salvation Front, who reportedly warned against holding a presidential election this year and predicted a dramatic increase of violence and confrontation only three days before the car bombing.</p>
        <p>In tracts that circulated in Algeria, the armed groups corroborated these warnings and threatened to intensify their attacks during the month of Ramadan.</p>
        <p>You assert that the authenticity of such tracts has been questioned by "some Algerians and foreign experts, who assert they are produced by Government intelligence officers to damage the Islamic parties." This gives the benefit of the doubt to the Islamists and their terrorists.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview reported by The Financial Times of London on Feb. 2, Anwar Haddam, identified as the president of the Islamic Salvation Front's parliamentary delegation to Europe and the United States, insisted that the car bomb was part of the "armed struggle" against the Government. This declaration cannot leave any doubt as to the authors of this attack. H. OSMANE BENCHERIF  Washington, Feb. 8, 1995 The writer is Algeria's ambassador designate.</p>
