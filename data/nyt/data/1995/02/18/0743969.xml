        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Feb. 9 obituary of the fine Berkeley mathematician Raphael Robinson calls his deceased wife Julia Robinson his "longtime collaborator on mathematical papers." Very little of her work was collaborative with her husband. She was elected to the National Academy of Science and was president of the American Mathematical Society. Had genders been reversed, would such a description have been applied?  MARTIN DAVIS  Prof. of Mathematics &amp; Computer Science, New York University New York, Feb. 10, 1995</p>
