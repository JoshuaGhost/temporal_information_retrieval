        <p>China said today that the United States "will increase the danger of nuclear war" and "trigger an arms race in outer space" if it proceeds with a plan to develop an advanced missile defense system that could be deployed around United States forces in Asia.</p>
        <p>A proposal to build a missile shield covering the United States -- reminiscent of the "Star Wars" program of the Reagan years -- was defeated on Thursday in the House of Representatives. But the Clinton Administration and some members of Congress support the development of a smaller "theater missile defense" system to protect American forces and allies when they are exposed to shorter-range missiles like those Iraq fired against Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.</p>

        <p>China said today that the United States "will increase the danger of nuclear war" and "trigger an arms race in outer space" if it proceeds with a plan to develop an advanced missile defense system that could be deployed around United States forces in Asia.</p>
        <p>A proposal to build a missile shield covering the United States -- reminiscent of the "Star Wars" program of the Reagan years -- was defeated on Thursday in the House of Representatives. But the Clinton Administration and some members of Congress support the development of a smaller "theater missile defense" system to protect American forces and allies when they are exposed to shorter-range missiles like those Iraq fired against Israel and Saudi Arabia during the Persian Gulf war in 1991.</p>
        <p>The Chinese warning was delivered by a senior Foreign Ministry official, who briefed reporters on condition that he not be identified.</p>
        <p>"If a country with nuclear weapons has a spear and then gets a shield, you can imagine what would happen," the official said, referring to the potential for a first strike without fear of retaliation.</p>
        <p>China's opposition to antimissile systems stems from fears in the military leadership that an American antimissile system -- if deployed in Asia to protect Japan or South Korea -- could render China's small force of nuclear-tipped strategic missiles ineffective.</p>
        <p>Senior Chinese military officials have told high-level American visitors that China's national prestige demands that it maintain the credibility of its nuclear deterrent force of about 300 long-range warheads.</p>
        <p>Without that credibility, China would be subject to "blackmail," the official said. He reminded reporters that the United States considered using nuclear weapons against China during the Korean War.</p>
        <p>At the briefing, the official also made these assertions:</p>
        <p>*China and Russia are justified in selling civilian nuclear technology to Iran as long as it is done under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>
        <p>*Despite President Clinton's decision to extend the American moratorium on underground nuclear testing, China is free to continue exploding a new generation of warheads in underground tests until 1996, when it has committed itself to sign a comprehensive test ban treaty.</p>
        <p>*Even after China signs a test ban treaty, its leaders have not decided whether to press for "small" underground tests to insure the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons already in the arsenal.</p>
        <p>The official's warning on missile defenses comes before a series of high-level American visits to Beijing, including trips by Energy Secretary Hazel R. O'Leary and Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for Asian Affairs. The Foreign Ministry official said China had expressed its opposition to a theater missile defense through a variety of diplomatic channels and "whenever we meet."</p>
        <p>"We are opposed to any modified form of the Strategic Defense Initiative because it will touch off another round of arms race in outer space," he said. "I believe it will increase the danger of nuclear war."</p>
        <p>At one point, the official raised his voice and accused the United States and the news media of falsely portraying China as a threat to international peace. He complained that since Communist China was founded, it has been portrayed as a threat to peace.</p>
        <p>"When China was poor, we were a threat, and when China is rich, we are a threat," he said. "But history is history. We have been the victim of aggression and occupation. We are tired of all these allegations. Enough is enough."</p>
