        <p>The Carnegie Hall Jazz Band's "Trumpet Tribute" to four of jazz's greatest trumpeters on Thursday was a good example of how the institutional repertory movement can self-destruct under good intentions. The show did something admirable: it commissioned two suites, one as a tribute to Louis Armstrong, the other for Miles Davis. And it featured Lalo Schifrin's "Gillespiana Suite," a tribute to Dizzy Gillespie, recorded in 1960. It was all workmanlike and long-winded. The fourth trumpeter, who happens to be alive and playing exquisitely, was Clark Terry, who came on at 10:40 for a short 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Finally, the music rose above the level of the tribute. Mr. Terry, playing fluegelhorn and backed by the Carnegie Hall orchestra, spread out a series of stunning solos that by their rhythmic complexity would have ended any discussion at a jam session. Mr. Terry's technique allows him an extraordinary fluency, and on several improvisations he easily jumped registers; on a ballad of his the melody shimmered with emotion. Then suddenly, the show was over. A birthday cake celebrating Mr. Terry's 75th birthday arrived, as did three other trumpeters, including Doc Cheatham.</p>

        <p>The Carnegie Hall Jazz Band's "Trumpet Tribute" to four of jazz's greatest trumpeters on Thursday was a good example of how the institutional repertory movement can self-destruct under good intentions. The show did something admirable: it commissioned two suites, one as a tribute to Louis Armstrong, the other for Miles Davis. And it featured Lalo Schifrin's "Gillespiana Suite," a tribute to Dizzy Gillespie, recorded in 1960. It was all workmanlike and long-winded. The fourth trumpeter, who happens to be alive and playing exquisitely, was Clark Terry, who came on at 10:40 for a short 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>Finally, the music rose above the level of the tribute. Mr. Terry, playing fluegelhorn and backed by the Carnegie Hall orchestra, spread out a series of stunning solos that by their rhythmic complexity would have ended any discussion at a jam session. Mr. Terry's technique allows him an extraordinary fluency, and on several improvisations he easily jumped registers; on a ballad of his the melody shimmered with emotion. Then suddenly, the show was over. A birthday cake celebrating Mr. Terry's 75th birthday arrived, as did three other trumpeters, including Doc Cheatham.</p>
        <p>Mr. Terry is one of the great living improvisers in jazz and one of jazz's finest trumpeters ever. He's also one of the few people left performing who understand jazz's relationship with vaudeville and its link to an audience. He can sustain a whole show, and to spend so much of the time letting younger trumpeters -- Nicholas Payton, Jon Faddis and Wallace Roney -- pay homage to older masters seemed like a waste of a resource.</p>
        <p>The concert opened with a suite by the trumpeter Randy Sandke called "King Louis," which combined tunes associated with Mr. Armstrong: "Sleepy Time Down South," "Basin Street Blues," "Tight Like This." Mr. Sandke has a wide historical palette, and the piece, though it tried to capture Armstrong's ebullience, also used harmonies from across the jazz spectrum.</p>
        <p>Slide Hampton's "Suite for Miles" featured Mr. Roney. It borrowed several pieces from Mr. Davis's repertory, including "Four" and "So What" along with harmonies taken from Mr. Davis's association with Gil Evans, and merged them. Mr. Roney occasionally sounded like Mr. Davis, but his lines, long and tricky, were his own.</p>
        <p>The third composition, "Gillespiana Suite," is based in part on blues harmonies, and on record it hangs together well. At Carnegie Hall, something about the interpretation made it seem choppy, even if the material itself was rich with ideas. Mr. Faddis, who has some of the best improvisatory gambits of anybody working, played hard, clear notes, and the band riffed sharp rapping bursts that mirrored Mr. Gillespie's sensibility. It all made a listener beg for originality, which arrived in the form of Mr. Terry and didn't last long enough.  JAZZ REVIEW</p>
