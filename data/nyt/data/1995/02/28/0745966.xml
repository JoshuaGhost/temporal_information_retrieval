        <p>The overcrowding crisis in Italian prisons set a record this weekend, when the San Vittorio prison in Milan literally ran out of room. For three days, starting last Friday, local police had to ship an estimated 400 new prisoners out of town, some to jails outside the city and some as far away as the island of Sardinia.</p>
        <p>With space for 1,100 prisoners, the 19th-century prison hit overload last week with 2,450 inmates. The freeze on new admissions, which ended this morning, alleviated the situation somewhat, but according to the warden, Luigi Pagano, "It is not an optimal situation."</p>

        <p>The overcrowding crisis in Italian prisons set a record this weekend, when the San Vittorio prison in Milan literally ran out of room. For three days, starting last Friday, local police had to ship an estimated 400 new prisoners out of town, some to jails outside the city and some as far away as the island of Sardinia.</p>
        <p>With space for 1,100 prisoners, the 19th-century prison hit overload last week with 2,450 inmates. The freeze on new admissions, which ended this morning, alleviated the situation somewhat, but according to the warden, Luigi Pagano, "It is not an optimal situation."</p>
        <p>"We have returned to a more liveable level," he said in a telephone interview, "but it is still an anomalous situation."</p>
        <p>Cells built for four inmates now house eight; medical services are taxed to their limit, and prison guards are barely able to maintain order. "Obviously, it is not possible to go on like this," Mr. Pagano said.</p>
        <p>The overflow in Milan is just the latest manifestation of a crisis that has made Italy's prison system a national disgrace. A series of inmate deaths and suicides in the first weeks of this year raised a storm of criticism about the inadequacy of the prison health care system, while others question the high proportion of prisoners held for months, sometimes even years, awaiting trial.</p>
        <p>But mainly it is overcrowding -- 54,000 inmates living in space designed for 29,000 -- that has created what many have described as third-world conditions inside Italian prisons. The problem is particularly acute in big cities, where inmates routinely packed into cramped, filthy cells, often with only holes in the ground for toilets.</p>
        <p>In such conditions, health care -- indeed, any care -- for prisoners has suffered. Prisoners who have already died behind bars this year include a 51-year-old woman with a brain tumor whose transfer to a hospital was delayed by Naples jail authorities for lack of a signature on a key document. In another case seized on by the Italian press, Generoso Del Gaizo, a 58-year-old inmate with severe heart and liver ailments, died a week after he was released from a local hospital back to the Poggioreale prison in Naples, where he was supposed to have been under the care of a medical expert who never did manage to locate him.</p>
        <p>"These are national scandals," said Franco Corbelli, president of a committee for prisoners' rights, who estimates that 2,500 prisoners around the country are now in a grave medical condition. "Many of those who are ill have not even been seen by doctors. In Naples alone, there are 60 cases of people near death."</p>
        <p>The number of suicides in Italian jails is strikingly high. According to Mr. Corbelli, five inmates took their lives just in the first months of this year. The official number of suicides in 1993 was 61, Mr. Corbelli said. By comparison, eight suicides took place in New York state's prisons and jails in 1993, when the average daily inmate population was 63,489.</p>
        <p>Many of the prison deaths, both from illness and suicide, occur among inmates who are still awaiting trial. At San Vittorio prison, Mr. Pagano estimated that 25 percent to 30 percent of the inmates have not yet gone to trial. Many detainees, who are kept in the same prisons as convicted criminals, are held in hopes that they will either confess or turn state's evidence.</p>
        <p>One problem is that Italian judges have been burned in the past when they let prisoners out for medical treatment. One Mafia boss, Pietro Vernengo, then 48 and serving a life sentence in a Palermo jail, was released to a local hospital for special treatment in 1991, only to walk out the back door three weeks later, carrying a television, a radio and a pair of pajamas. According to one Italian newspaper report, one of the prisoners now considered gravely ill in Naples is Mr. Vernengo's son-in-law, accused of involvement in the 1992 bombing death of Paolo Borsellino, a Palermo Mafia investigator.</p>
        <p>But while most Mafia defendants are kept under strict isolation to bar their contact with the outside world, others are released and allowed to fall through gaping cracks in the Italian legal system. According to a recent Italian newspaper report, a judge in Turin last month sentenced a man to 24 years in jail for a Mafia murder, only to discover that the man had himself been killed in a Mafia shootout in November.</p>
        <p>At the height of Italy's "Clean Hands" operation, the name given to the campaign against bribery and corruption that toppled the country's political elite, an estimated 700 accused bureaucrats and businessmen were held behind bars in preventive custody. One of these, the former chairman of the state energy group ENI, Gabriele Cagliari, committed suicide in Milan's San Vittorio prison, which he described in a suicide note as "a menagerie for animals without heads or souls."</p>
        <p>To no one's great surprise, only a few of those accused in the bribery and corruption investigation have actually been convicted. And of those who have been, most are free on appeal.</p>
        <p>One exception is Walter Armanini, a former cemetery official from Milan who was sentenced to five years and seven months on charges of accepting bribes for grave sites. Mr. Armanini turned himself in last month after months in hiding, but managed to land himself in a small prison in Orvieto, which has only 100 inmates and no overcrowding.</p>
        <p>But most Italian prisons have experienced a sudden explosion in their population over the last few years, although the total population actually dropped in 1990. Public attention has focused on a new influx of mafiosi being convicted and on the political corruption and bribery scandals.</p>
        <p>In fact, most of the increase comes from a general crackdown against crime, which in the early 1990's began imposing harsher penalties on a series of minor offenses, including possession of small amounts of drugs. This trend increased the number of drug addicts in Italian jails, now said to number about 15,000, as well as the number of foreign citizens, who now account for 8,600 inmates, or 15 percent of the total prison population, and significantly more in big city jails.</p>
        <p>"It depends on which political winds are blowing," said Leo Beneduci, deputy secretary general of an Italian prison guards union. "In the 1980's, the problem was terrorism, and the state used the jails as a pacifier. The Mafia has always been there, but then there was a big effort to crack down. Bribery and corruption were part of a system which we now hope is finished, but which only recently were seen as a crime."</p>
        <p>"Then there was the problem of narcotics users, and whereas before the judges gave mild sentences, now they have increased penalties again," he added. "In fact, a prison population of about 54,000 is about right for a European country of Italy's size. The error was in not anticipating it."</p>
