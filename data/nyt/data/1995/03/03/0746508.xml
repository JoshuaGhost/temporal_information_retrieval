        <p>Culminating nearly a decade of intense effort, two rival groups of physicists announced today that they had found the elusive top quark -- an ephemeral building block of matter that probably holds clues to some of the ultimate riddles of existence.</p>
        <p>The announcements brought sustained applause and a barrage of questions from an overflow audience of physicists at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, where the work was done. Fermilab has the world's most powerful particle accelerator.</p>
        <p>The two competing scientific teams, each with about 450 scientists and each using a separate detection system, reported that after a long chase in which there had been several false sightings of the top quark, this monstrously heavy but elusive particle has finally been cornered and measured. The results of the two groups' independent measurements differed somewhat, but when margins of error were taken into account, the scientists agreed that the results were consistent.</p>
        <p>One of the teams, the CDF Collaboration (standing for Collider Detector at Fermilab) reported last April that it had found evidence of the quark's existence. But at the time, the group lacked enough statistical evidence to claim discovery, and the competing group, the D0 (for D-Zero) Collaboration, which had even less evidence of its own, branded the CDF announcement as premature.</p>
        <p>The achievement claimed today by both teams leaves virtually no room for doubt, however, and the discovery was hailed as a landmark in science. Hazel O'Leary, who as Secretary of Energy heads the Federal agency providing most of the money for research at Fermilab, called the discovery a "major contribution to human understanding of the fundamentals of the universe."</p>
        <p>The finding confirms a prediction based on a theory known as the Standard Model that nature has provided the universe with six types of quarks; the other five, the up, down, strange, charm and bottom quarks had all been known or discovered by 1977. Since the infancy of the universe shortly after the Big Bang -- estimated at 10 billion to 20 billion years ago -- only the up and down quarks have survived in nature, and the protons and neutrons that make up the nuclei of all atoms are built from combinations of these two quarks; the other quarks disappeared from the observed universe, but have been recreated by modern particle accelerators.</p>
        <p>Dr. Leon M. Lederman, a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics and a former director of Fermilab, said at today's meeting that he doubted there could be any more quark types but that "we know there's a lot of dark matter out in the universe that we can't identify."</p>
        <p>"We're still in for a lot of surprises," he added.</p>
        <p>But more important than merely completing the table of quarks predicted by theory, the top quark may now begin to shed light on a deep philosophical question: everything in the universe, from the most distant galaxy to a rose petal, is made of quarks. Were the masses and other properties of these particles determined by random chance, or by some fundamental unifying plan? If so, what is that plan, and how might gravity, the least understood of the four forces of nature, be related to it?</p>
        <p>"This monster, compared with all the other quarks, is like a big cowbird's egg in a nest of little sparrow eggs," said Dr. Paul D. Grannis, a leader of the D0 group. "It's so peculiar it must hold clues to some important new physics."</p>
        <p>"The top quark has turned out to be so heavy," added Dr. John Peoples, director of Fermilab, "that it's kind of a laboratory in itself, from which many new experiments will certainly yield important insights."</p>
        <p>It may be, scientists believe, that quarks (and the higher forms of matter they make up) are endowed with mass by interacting with an all-pervading universal "field," with which they communicate through a hypothetical particle called the Higgs boson. To find and measure the Higgs boson would be as exciting for a physicist as the creation of life in a test tube would be for a biologist.</p>
        <p>One of the questions high-energy physicists regard as fundamental is whether there is a single type of Higgs boson, or several types. Theory predicts that if is possible to accurately measure the masses of two known particles -- the top quarks and the W particles that transmit the weak nuclear force -- it will be possible to determine whether there are one or more than one Higgs bosons.</p>
        <p>"We're so elated by the discovery of the top quark that we haven't yet begun to sift all the data," said Dr. Boaz Klima of Fermilab, one of the leaders of the successful search. "But this particle is so astonisingly heavy that its decay may give us hints of a lot of other things, perhaps even of supersymmetric particles."</p>
        <p>The quest for supersymmetric particles by the world's most powerful accelerators during the last decade has failed to turn up any evidence that they exist, but according to some theories, they may be so heavy they are beyond reach of present-day accelerators. If supersymmetric particles could be shown to exist, they might offer scientists a tool for learning how gravity is related to the other forces of nature: the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear forces.</p>
        <p>Even when trillions of protons and antiprotons are made to collide in Fermilab's huge accelerator at combined energies of two trillion electron-volts, the creation of top quarks by the miniature fireballs remains a rare event.</p>
        <p>Dr. Grannis of the D0 collaboration said today that his group, which has been running its detector on and off since 1992, has found 17 collisions resulting in evidence of the creation of a top quark. The team was able to calculate the mass of the particle as 199 billion electron-volts, give or take about 30 billion electron-volts. (Particle physicists measure mass in terms of its energy equivalent, because the units are more practical. Einstein's famous equation E=mc2 defines the equivalency of mass and energy.)</p>
        <p>For their part, according to Dr. William Carithers Jr., a leader of the rival CDF Collaboration, two separate counting techniques using the CDF detector have turned up a total of about 21 top quark events. The group calculates the mass of the top quark as about 176 billion electron-volts, give or take about 13 billion.</p>
        <p>These results, the competing teams say, are in reasonably close agreement. At any rate, they agree that they have found the quark, and that there is only one chance in about one million that the results could have been caused by anything besides the decays of pairs of top and antitop quarks.</p>
        <p>One of the main difficulties in identifying the top quark is that it cannot be seen directly. When one is created from the immense pool of energy formed in the collisions of protons and antiprotons accelerated by Fermilab's Tevatron, its lifetime is so brief that no detector could sense it. But the top quark disintegrates into hundred of daughter particles, which in turn decay into cascades of other particles.</p>
        <p>From the patterns of "jets," particle types and other characterstics of these decays, theorists have learned to identify the parent particles like the top quark which cannot be detected directly. A jet is a spray of particles moving in the same general direction away from a collision.</p>
        <p>High-energy physics is expensive. The Fermilab Tevatron accelerator, a ring of superconducting magnets four miles in circumference, cost about $250 million to build, and each of the two detectors built into the accelerator cost about $60 million. An upgrade of the Tevatron called a main injector, costing $228 million, is scheduled for completion by 1999.</p>
        <p>The Superconducting Supercollider, a project that would have been Fermilab's successor, would have cost more than $8 billion if Congress had not canceled it last year. For the foreseeable future, Fermilab will remain America's most powerful particle acclerator, and scientists say that the machine has at least 15 more years of useful life.</p>
        <p>The stakes for the high-energy physics community are enormous, in terms of job security, the risks of failure and the promise of great prestige for leaders of successful experiments. Competition between physicists is often intense and sometimes bitter.</p>
        <p>The CDF and D0 detector collaborations have gone to great lengths to avoid even looking at each others' experiments -- a policy that persisted even today minutes before their joint seminar began.</p>
        <p>"We know that some of the younger physicists on both sides have been exchanging pirated copies of our reports, but we've tried to suppress such exchanges," one physicist said. "Of course there is friction, but that's a healthy aspect of science. This way, we know that our results are in no way influenced by those of our competitors, and when both our versions of the top quark are published side by side, scientists will be able to judge for themselves."</p>
        <p>Despite a joking undertone of bickering between the two collaborations, which include scientists from a dozen nations, a holiday mood today eclipsed old rivalries and the collective anxiety about future financing of high-energy physics.</p>
        <p>"We're ecstatic about this discovery," Dr. Peoples said. "Non-scientists often ask me what the point of all this may be. I say it's important because it makes the universe knowable, in the same sense that our discovery of DNA has made the nature of life knowable. We have a long, long way to go, but it's one of the most intellectually satisfying pursuits there is."</p>
