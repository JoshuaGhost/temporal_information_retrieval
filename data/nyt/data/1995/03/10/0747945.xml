        <p>WEAPON OF CHOICE IN SCHOOLS: BOX CUTTER</p>
        <p>At first, the two dozen or so students milling about outside Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx agreed that schools need to be made safer. But in a few moments, swift as switchblades, the students produced a gleaming assortment of weapons. There was a pearl-handled pocket knife, a pair of brass knuckles and, most favored of all, box cutters. A1. NEW YORK CITY</p>

        <p>WEAPON OF CHOICE IN SCHOOLS: BOX CUTTER</p>
        <p>At first, the two dozen or so students milling about outside Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx agreed that schools need to be made safer. But in a few moments, swift as switchblades, the students produced a gleaming assortment of weapons. There was a pearl-handled pocket knife, a pair of brass knuckles and, most favored of all, box cutters. A1. NEW YORK CITY</p>
        <p>AIRPORTS PLAN SAFETY PADS FOR PLANES</p>
        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said that it would install foam blocks at the end of some runways at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports, as a kind of flypaper for airplanes that roll too far. B3. PATAKI ASKS JAVITS BOARD TO RESIGN</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki branded conditions at the corruption-tainted Jacob K. Javits Convention Center "intolerable to me and to all New Yorkers," and called for its board to resign. B3. BODY OF SECOND BURNED WOMAN IS FOUND</p>
        <p>Five days after the police found the charred body of a 20-year-old Canarsie woman in the basement of a vacant house, the body of another young woman -- also burned beyond recognition -- was found in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. The police said they had no specific evidence to link the two cases but added that there were some similarities. B3. MAYOR'S POPULARITY SUFFERS A DROP</p>
        <p>After a year of high approval ratings for Mayor Giuliani, his austere budget proposals have apparently caused his popularity to sag sharply in the last few months, according to a poll. B3. GIULIANI ORDERS REVIEW OF HOSPITALS</p>
        <p>In response to reports of high rates of deaths and injuries for newborns at New York City's public hospitals, Mayor Giuliani and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi said that they had begun a review of delivery room care. B2. THOUSANDS HAVE FUND TO THANK</p>
        <p>Thousands of lives were made better this year by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. A total of 12,868 donors from Bay Ridge to Bangkok helped raise $4,526,919.95, the third-highest total ever. B2. REGION  BANKS PLEDGE TO PRESERVE JOBS</p>
        <p>Under intense pressure from Gov. John G. Rowland, Connecticut's two largest banks announced that they had revised their merger plans to guarantee that the state would not lose jobs. B5. CATSKILLS RESIDENTS RALLY FOR CASINO</p>
        <p>At a standing-room-only meeting of the Sullivan County Board of Supervisors, local residents rallied in support of the Oneida Indian Nation's proposal to build a casino and said they would fight to get approval from the Governor. Without a casino, they said, the Catskills region's economy would continue to slide. B5. SPEAKER BACKS TIME LIMITS ON WELFARE</p>
        <p>Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said that he would support time limits on welfare for childless, able-bodied adults if they refuse to enter job training or to search for work. B4. SUIT SEEKS TV MONEY FOR VICTIM'S ESTATE</p>
        <p>In one of the first lawsuits filed under New York's revised "Son of Sam" law, Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco asked a court to force Time Warner to pay $55,000 to the estate of a murder victim whose killing was portrayed in a made-for-television movie. B4.</p>
