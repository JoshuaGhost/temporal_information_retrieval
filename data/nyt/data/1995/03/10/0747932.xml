        <p>For most people, Chinese ceramics means Ming and Ching: dainty white vases with blue hermits meditating in soggy blue forests, hulking green pots with flowers crawling over them, or little teacups with red and blue dragons chasing in circles. Even the museum-quality examples of this stuff are uncomfortably reminiscent of hotel rooms and Chinese restaurants.</p>
        <p>The ceramics in "New Finds, Old Treasures: Early Chinese Ceramics From the Meiyintang Collection," at the Asia Society, do not look like hotel-room furniture. For one thing, the most recent objects in the show date from the 13th century and were made for the imperial court. In contrast, the Ming and Ching styles date from the 14th century to early this century and were made largely for export. The Chinese kept the good stuff for themselves. (Didn't you always suspect as much?) For another, the exhibition begins in the fifth millennium B.C., long before the emergence of anything recognizable as "Chinese" culture. The pottery of the Yangshao era (5000 to 1500 B.C.) is decorated with geometric motifs similar to those on African and archaic Greek pottery: another reminder that abstraction is a fundamental tendency of the human mind, not an aberration of 20th-century art.</p>

        <p>The ceramics in "New Finds, Old Treasures: Early Chinese Ceramics From the Meiyintang Collection," at the Asia Society, do not look like hotel-room furniture. For one thing, the most recent objects in the show date from the 13th century and were made for the imperial court. In contrast, the Ming and Ching styles date from the 14th century to early this century and were made largely for export. The Chinese kept the good stuff for themselves. (Didn't you always suspect as much?) For another, the exhibition begins in the fifth millennium B.C., long before the emergence of anything recognizable as "Chinese" culture. The pottery of the Yangshao era (5000 to 1500 B.C.) is decorated with geometric motifs similar to those on African and archaic Greek pottery: another reminder that abstraction is a fundamental tendency of the human mind, not an aberration of 20th-century art.</p>
        <p>The Shang and Chou Dynasties, from around 1500 to 221 B.C., are the great age of Chinese bronzes, and the ceramics of this period are often the same shape as the bronze vessels. What's surprising is that the ceramics seem to have different, more linear decorative motifs. The dragon-mask (tao tieh) motif, which is nearly ubiquitous on the bronzes, is nowhere in evidence on the ceramics. A wonderful Han Dynasty jar (just before the beginning of the Christian era) bears a scene of a mounted archer pursuing a tiger, surrounded by curving bands of white, beige and lavender; it seems more reminiscent of Indian than of Chinese painting.</p>
        <p>Only in the Tang period (A.D. 618 to 906) do the ceramics begin to look definitely Chinese. Several of the objects in this section of the show -- an earthenware camel, a tomb figure of a seated woman and a phoenix-headed ewer -- have the distinctive combination of brownish-red, blue and green glazes known as sancai. What's special about sancai is not merely the choice of colors (often imitated in later centuries) but also the casualness of their application: seemingly poured over the object, leaving large areas of raw clay bare. By the seventh century, Chinese potters had reached a kind of sophistication that we often think of as particular to our own time. Tired of technical perfection, they enlivened the exquisitely controlled forms of their work with a rough, haphazard use of color.</p>
        <p>This deliberate contradiction was refined in the Sung period (A.D. 960 to 1279), which marks the high point of Chinese ceramics. In the Ru, Ge and Guan styles of these centuries, simple shapes and subtle blue-green glazes were enhanced with a network of tiny cracks called crazing. A label explains that the first cracks to appear were stained black, while the secondary cracks were colored golden brown: the combination was known as "iron wires and golden threads." After the imposing refinement of these pieces, it's almost a relief to turn to the pottery of the Liao, a "barbarian" tribe that conquered the north of China in the early 12th century. The Liao potters revived the warm colors of the sancai glazes, applying them over incised patterns of leaves and flowers that look like line drawings by Matisse.</p>
        <p>Throughout the exhibition, the objects are accompanied by wall texts and explanatory labels that provide just enough background for the layman while hinting at the more complex questions that preoccupy scholars. From room to room, the labels trace the technical evolution of the ceramics, from crude earthenware to harder stoneware up through the evolution of porcelain, made from special clays that fuse into the hardness and translucency of glass. A set of white bowls and cups from the eighth century may be nothing much to look at, but it is the direct ancestor of the plates of today. Other labels explore the opposition between popular and court styles: actually, it turns out that the latest archeological discoveries suggest that these were less different than scholars have thought.</p>
        <p>The unexplained mystery here has to do with the anonymous Swiss collection from which the exhibition is drawn. ("Meiyintang" is not the name of the owners but a Chinese word meaning "Hall Among Rose Beds.") The two-volume catalogue available in the Asia Society bookstore reveals that the 80 objects in the exhibition are merely a fraction of the collection. Some of the objects here have long been famous, others are recent finds: hence the show's title, "New Finds, Old Treasures." It would be nice to learn more about the history of the collection; in the meantime, it's our good fortune to get a glimpse of its contents.</p>
        <p>"New Finds, Old Treasures: Early Chinese Ceramics From the Meiyintang Collection" remains at the Asia Society Galleries, 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, through June 18.</p>
