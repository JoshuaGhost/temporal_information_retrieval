        <p>As he seeks to make New York State's environmental bureaucracy less adversarial toward business, Michael D. Zagata, the new Commissioner for Environmental Conservation, says the state should begin telling people that if they want cleaner air and water, they must pay more of the bill.</p>
        <p>"We've got to start educating the public about the fact that some of the burden for getting the last increment that's left is going to shift from industry to the consumer," he said in an interview after his confirmation by the State Senate on Monday. "We have not done a good job of that, and that's why I think you're seeing a revolt."</p>
        <p>That revolt, he said, is being led by ordinary citizens who object to paying more for cleaner-burning gasoline and cleaner-running cars, for public purchases of scenic land and the cleanup of toxic waste on industrial sites. He said that if people do not want to pay, they must understand that making industry foot the bill will hurt the economy.</p>
        <p>"Do we want to say, 'Industry, you're going to have to clean up even though it's a 200-to-1 higher cost,' and run the risk of driving industry out of the state?" he asked.</p>
        <p>In his quest to balance economic interests with environmental ones, Mr. Zagata reflects the dual -- critics would say contradictory -- mission of Gov. George E. Pataki. The Governor has won plaudits from environmentalists, but also campaigned last year to reduce regulation, often citing the Department of Environmental Conservation as a prime example of burdensome bureaucracy. Mr. Pataki now wants Mr. Zagata to satisfy both sides: be less onerous to industry without being less vigilant about pollution.</p>
        <p>Without offering details, Mr. Zagata said he envisioned a variety of policies to reverse his agency's reputation for punishing companies rather than working with them to solve environmental problems.</p>
        <p>He said he would establish programs to educate companies about regulations so arcane that "the way a piece of paper is filed" can be a violation. He would require inspectors to perform their work in fewer visits to avoid "interrupting production." He would speed issuance of pollution and building permits.</p>
        <p>And he would give companies more opportunities to correct pollution problems before the state takes enforcement action. To do that, he would have inspectors perform "environmental audits" that inform companies about possible pollution violations. Six months later, another team of inspectors would review whether the company had taken steps to reverse those problems. If steps were taken, no fines or penalties would be levied.</p>
        <p>"For the last several years, the appearance has been that our mission has been enforcement rather than compliance," he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Zagata said he did not want the agency to be all carrots and no sticks. "Enforcement is definitely a tool in my bag of tricks," he told a State Senate committee on Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zagata cites economic issues in suggesting that he might change the department's direction on other matters. He questioned whether the state should continue plans to centralize its auto-inspection system and to require that 2 percent of all new cars offered for sale by 1998 be electric-powered. He voiced concerns about whether the state should buy more land in the Adirondacks, saying he did not want to hurt local towns by reducing their tax bases.</p>
        <p>And he said that any plan to protect New York City's watershed must not harm the economies of watershed towns, criticizing city officials for "walking away from the table" during negotiations with those towns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zagata's comments have already infuriated some environmentalists. Lee Wasserman, executive director of Environmental Advocates, a nonprofit group, said Mr. Zagata's policies mean polluters "will get one free bite at the apple." Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, chairman of the Assembly Environmental Committee, attacked Mr. Zagata for allowing Mr. Pataki to make budget cuts that he said would gut the agency's enforcement abilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zagata, 52, is a native New Yorker who speaks with a Texas twang developed during 14 years working as an environmental manager in Houston for oil and natural gas companies. There, he pioneered a concept known as mitigation banking, which allows companies to earn permits for building on protected wetlands by first expanding existing wetlands. He said he planned a similar policy for New York State, starting with state highway projects.</p>
        <p>In 1994, he lost his job as vice president of environmental affairs for Transco Energy during a corporate downsizing, and was hired by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to be the Environmental Conservation Department's liaison to business.</p>
        <p>He holds a doctorate in wildlife ecology, has worked as a lobbyist for the National Audubon Society and has taught wildlife resources at the University of Maine.</p>
        <p>Born in the tiny rural town of West Davenport, Mr. Zagata is an outdoorsman whose office walls are hung with photographs of him hunting and fishing. Though he is only 5 feet 8 inches tall, he is a former football tackle who clearly takes some pride in his toughness.</p>
        <p>He recalls, for instance, being rapped on the knuckles by his parochial-school teachers whenever he wrote left-handed. Today, Mr. Zagata remains a proud and unrepentant southpaw with a pen.</p>
        <p>"Every time they hit me, I'd go home and practice with my left hand," he recalled with a smile.</p>
