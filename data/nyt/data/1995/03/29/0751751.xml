        <p>Drawing battle lines over Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed New York City budget, officials of the City Council said yesterday that they would scale back some or all of the Mayor's $185 million in proposed tax cuts if the city failed to receive enough state aid and could not find ways to pay for the cuts without drastically reducing services.</p>
        <p>And if the city can afford any tax reductions, the Council officials said they would propose alternatives to the Mayor's plan that would provide a greater benefit for middle- and working-class New Yorkers.</p>

        <p>Drawing battle lines over Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposed New York City budget, officials of the City Council said yesterday that they would scale back some or all of the Mayor's $185 million in proposed tax cuts if the city failed to receive enough state aid and could not find ways to pay for the cuts without drastically reducing services.</p>
        <p>And if the city can afford any tax reductions, the Council officials said they would propose alternatives to the Mayor's plan that would provide a greater benefit for middle- and working-class New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the officials said yesterday, the Council would reject the Mayor's proposed elimination of sales tax on clothing under $100 and instead propose a package of tax cuts for homeowners, first-time home buyers and married couples, as well as tax credits for college students and working families.</p>
        <p>The tax issue is included in a report, to be released today, detailing the Council's concerns and objections to the Mayor's financial blueprint for the coming fiscal year. It reflected the opening barrage in what could become a bitter fight over the Mayor's proposed $30.5 billion budget, which includes a $1.3 billion spending cut, the deepest reduction since the Great Depression.</p>
        <p>In the summary of its report, scheduled to be released today in full, the Council also takes the Mayor to task for calling on Gov. George E. Pataki to expand his proposed reductions in Medicaid and welfare, saving the city a total of $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, as the Governor and State Legislature have haggled over the state's budget, the Council has lobbied in Albany against many of the Mayor's and Governor's cuts in those programs, saying they will cost the city in the long run.</p>
        <p>"The Council believes that the financial plan responds to the current political climate and economic circumstances, but in many areas fails to acknowledge the long-term social and economic consequences of these budget choices," the report said.</p>
        <p>The Council's report also staked out its opposition to the Mayor's proposed cuts in education, sanitation, cultural programs and youth services. And it recommended abolishing the Human Resources Administration and dividing the Department of Social Services into three new agencies dealing separately with children, adults, and benefits programs for Medicaid and welfare.</p>
        <p>The Mayor's office declined to comment on the Council's proposals until officials could review it. "We look forward to studying the Council budget plan," said a spokeswoman, Karen A. Crowe.</p>
        <p>Although the summary report made clear that the Council would oppose the Mayor on several fronts, it did not address the additional cuts the city could be forced to make if it fails to receive all of the savings from the state that the Mayor anticipated in the budget plan he unveiled in February.</p>
        <p>A Council official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the uncertainty in Albany raised questions about the city's ability to afford the tax cuts the Mayor proposed, which total $185 million in the next fiscal year and grow to $539 million in the following year.</p>
        <p>Besides objecting to eliminating the clothing sales tax, whose loss would cost the city $98 million in revenues in the next fiscal year, the Council also opposes the elimination of the 12.5 percent surcharge on personal income tax that Mr. Giuliani proposed beginning in fiscal year 1997. The costs of the two tax cuts, the Council said, would total $370 million over the next two years.</p>
        <p>In its report, the Council's staff argues that the Mayor's tax cuts over the next four years offered more savings for people who make more than $80,000, while the Council's plan would give greater relief to people who make less than that. The Council also argued that tax relief for home buyers would stimulate economic growth. The Council will not oppose the Mayor's $70 million reduction in property taxes on co-ops and condos.</p>
        <p>The Council also clashed with the administration yesterday over the Mayor's plan to sell three of New York City's 11 municipal hospitals.</p>
        <p>In more than four hours of often combative testimony, Maria K. Mitchell, the Mayor's special adviser on health policy and the newly appointed chairwoman of the Health and Hospitals Corporation, rejected charges that the Mayor's office had developed its plan without doing adequate research on its impact and without consulting the Council.</p>
        <p>"I want to know what is the mind-set of the administration," said Julia Harrison, a Democrat from Queens.  "Are we serving an autocratic ruler?"</p>
        <p>Una Clarke, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said the administration's plan would dismantle the city's health care system for the poor. The Mayor, she said, was trying "to make it a city of the middle class and not the poor."</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell countered by saying that the city needed to restructure its health care system. "I can't understand why anybody wants to keep the status quo," she said, "when we have health indicators that show us that we're not doing a good job."</p>
