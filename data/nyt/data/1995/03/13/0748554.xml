        <p>I was trying to teach my puppy how to behave on a leash the other night. He is a Bernese mountain dog, 75 pounds at 6 months old, and yanked himself loose to run up a neighbor's driveway, where he stopped to sniff out a small brick structure on the way to the garage.</p>
        <p>I caught him and coaxed and dragged him back into the residential street. Then it struck me: the tempting brick outpost was once a Secret Service station, built there to protect Vice President Spiro T. Agnew when he lived in that house on Shadow Road. (That was a long generation ago, before V.P.'s lived in a public mansion behind electric fences.)</p>

        <p>I was trying to teach my puppy how to behave on a leash the other night. He is a Bernese mountain dog, 75 pounds at 6 months old, and yanked himself loose to run up a neighbor's driveway, where he stopped to sniff out a small brick structure on the way to the garage.</p>
        <p>I caught him and coaxed and dragged him back into the residential street. Then it struck me: the tempting brick outpost was once a Secret Service station, built there to protect Vice President Spiro T. Agnew when he lived in that house on Shadow Road. (That was a long generation ago, before V.P.'s lived in a public mansion behind electric fences.)</p>
        <p>Next day, the memory of Nixon's first Vice President -- once "Spiro Our Hero" to conservatives, and a black-hatted villain to ideological opponents he gleefully flayed as "radic-libs" -- intruded itself on my thoughts again.</p>
        <p>The new Republican Governor of Maryland, Parris Glendening, took the controversial step of hanging Agnew's portrait in the State House along with previous Governors, something the last two Democrats refused to do. The Frederick Post, in a wry editorial, approved: "There will always be a special place in the hearts or minds of Marylanders for Mr. Agnew and the kind of attention he brought the state."</p>
        <p>That notoriety was not limited to his reputation as a moderate Republican Governor who switched his political support from Nelson Rockefeller to Richard Nixon and was rewarded with a place on the 1968 ticket.</p>
        <p>Nor was it solely because of the way he was then ridiculed on the campaign trail; Agnew later slammed back at the media with the most memorable television address given by a Vice President -- the excoriation of "instant analysis," written by Pat Buchanan -- which has been the source of journalistic soul-searching and self-flagellation ever since.</p>
        <p>The noteworthiness, or infamy, he brought to his state and to conservatism was rooted in the charge that he was a common crook. He did not contest the accusation that he took envelopes of cash and the prosecutors gave him his freedom in exchange for his resignation.</p>
        <p>Having escaped being hanged, he is now being hung. Not only that, but I am informed (never put the story in the lead) that a marble bust of his handsome Grecian features is finally ready for unveiling in the Capitol's statuary hall -- that gloomy, sepulchral passage where the busts of all previous presidents of the Senate are preserved for posterity.</p>
        <p>Is Ted Agnew entitled to a small, dignified, rancor-free ceremony next month as he joins the row of enmarbled immortals? Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of Rules and Administration, has the duty of carrying out this tradition.</p>
        <p>Nobody was angrier at Agnew than me. The ideas in the speeches I wrote for him -- about elitism, permissiveness, the drug culture -- were discredited for a time by his disgrace. And all alliteration ached.</p>
        <p>His bitterness at witnesses who turned him in -- mainly Jewish -- along with Arab business dealings, earned him a blast here for anti-Semitism, though this was not exhibited before or since his travail. He became anti-Nixotic as well, refusing to return eight of the former President's phone calls over the years.</p>
        <p>That was then. He's since made an honest living brokering deals in the Far East. He showed up at Nixon's funeral and comported himself with quiet dignity. And he did not escape the punishment of destiny denied: had Agnew not been on the take, he would have taken the Presidential oath after Nixon's resignation.</p>
        <p>That's why I would attend the statue's unveiling, if invited. His rise and fall were instructive because his two-timing was out of joint:</p>
        <p>Never take money in envelopes while in office; that's graft, a crime compounded by hypocrisy when accompanied by eloquent ethical exhortations. Instead, take the money by check, with taxes withheld, for books after leaving office -- or if you are impatient, at least not in advance of publication. It enriches historical understanding as it fattens your wallet.</p>
        <p>That's for aspiring politicians to learn, as they peer down the long row of forgotten faces at the bust of Spiro Agnew, and for a forgiving-but-not-forgetting pundit to remember, as he wrestles his huge puppy past the house on Shadow Road.</p>
