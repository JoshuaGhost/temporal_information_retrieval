        <p>On the seventh floor of the East Hill Dormitory at Manhattan College last night, Coach Fran Fraschilla and his players gathered in front of a large-screen television and watched anxiously as the National Collegiate Athletic Association announced its tournament selections.</p>
        <p>After a seemingly endless wait, Manhattan finally made the big screen, and even though its next opponent would be Oklahoma (23-8), the Jaspers leaped off their seats and began hugging one another. Some players began to cry. Others just stared at the screen in stunned disbelief.</p>
        <p>"To watch the kids explode with joy was the greatest feeling in my 17-year coaching career," Fraschilla said. "It was better than any last-second, game-winning shot you could ever think of."</p>
        <p>Despite finishing this season with a 25-4 record and a nationally ranked defense, Manhattan was apprehensive about earning a spot in the N.C.A.A. playoffs. The Jaspers had been criticized this season for playing a soft schedule, and lost a chance for an automatic bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament by losing to St. Peter's in the championship game of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament last week in Albany. Most basketball observers felt Manhattan was headed to the National Invitation Tournament.</p>
        <p>But for the first time ever, the N.C.A.A. selection committee sent two M.A.A.C. teams into its post-season field of 64. Thirteenth-seeded Manhattan will play fourth-seeded Oklahoma in a Southeast Regional game on Thursday in Memphis; St. Peter's, seeded No. 15, drew Massachusetts in an East Regional game on Friday at Knickerbocker Arena in Albany.</p>
        <p>"I don't think precedent ever mattered with the tournament committee," Fraschilla said. "They rewarded us for sustained excellence over three months."</p>
        <p>Like most of his teammates, Jamal Marshall, a senior captain who plays center, sat in front of the television last night expecting the worst. When the Jaspers were finally selected, Marshall was initially too shocked to react.</p>
        <p>"When I saw our name pop on the screen, I was sort of paralyzed," Marshall said. "I really feel like I'm a part of something special."</p>
        <p>After celebrating with his players, Fraschilla immediately huddled with his assistant coaches and began preparing for Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>"It's going to be a tough test," the coach said. "But it sure beats being on the outside looking in. We're just glad we're going to be dancing in Memphis."  COLLEGE BASKETBALL</p>
