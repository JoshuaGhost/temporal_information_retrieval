        <p>The night ended not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with a remarkable legislative stall.</p>
        <p>All was moving according to schedule as the Senate wrapped up debate on the constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Closing statements were made by both sides, all the preliminary voting was done. House Republicans had wandered across the Capitol to watch the great victory. And then, after Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, wrapped up his final remarks, he suggested the absence of a quorum. Suddenly, what had been increasingly apparent all day long was clear: The Republicans lacked the votes.</p>
        <p>The process of getting them began to play out: Senator Kent Conrad, one of the last undecided Democrats, disappeared into a cloakroom in the company of several amendment supporters. About 20 minutes later, he emerged, and Senator Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader, raced to his side and pulled him into another cloakroom.</p>
        <p>Finally, about 40 minutes after this struggle began, Mr. Dole rose and asked that the Senate adjourn until Wednesday. There were audible gasps from the gallery, and Senator Robert C. Byrd, the 77-year-old Democrat of West Virginia who has led the opposition to this amendment, rose in high outrage. He asked for five minutes to speak, and Mr. Dole, ever wary of the West Virginian's parliamentary skill, clearly wondering what Mr. Byrd was up to now, looked skeptical but realized he had no choice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Byrd, who only hours before was shaking hands with the opposition and closing the debate on a courtly note, now laid into the Republicans with a vengeance. "This is a sad spectacle," he declared. "We're tampering with the Constitution of the United States. This is no place for deal-making, backroom huddles."</p>
        <p>He added, "I deplore this -- this tawdry effort here to go over till tomorrow so that additional pressures can be made on some poor member in the effort to get his vote."</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole, who looked like this was the last blow of a bad day, shot back, "To suggest that somehow this is unprecedented, tawdry, whatever, in my view is out of bounds."</p>
        <p>It was an emblematic ending for this day: Tipping the balance on this vote was not easy. Splitting the difference was impossible.</p>
        <p>All day, the switchboards had hummed in the offices of the undecided, like Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky. ("Senator Ford's office, please hold. . . . Senator Ford's office, please hold. . . . ") The debate had lasted 30 days, probably the longest continuous debate on a single piece of legislation since the major civil rights bills of the 1960's, according to experts in the Senate library. But the underlying political dynamic had changed very little.</p>
        <p>Republicans supported the amendment nearly en masse -- with the exception of Senator Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon, an object of some chilliness from some of his fellow Republicans today as he held fast to his opposition. He said he could not "in good conscience" relent. Mr. Dole said, in the tone of a disappointed parent, "I seldom ask anybody for anything around here."</p>
        <p>A majority of Democrats opposed the amendment, despite the widespread fear that they would spend an immense amount of time defending their vote and explaining that they were, in fact, fiscally responsible. The fate of the amendment, in the beginning and in the end, rested with a handful of undecided and palpably uncomfortable Democrats from the South and the northern Plains -- literal and figurative fault lines in their party.</p>
        <p>Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia, so often the swing vote in major disputes before the Senate, went over to the Republicans in midmorning, after they acceded to his request for language restricting judicial powers in enforcing the amendment. Senator John B. Breaux of Louisiana, who reveled in his deal-maker role in last year's health care struggle, quickly followed.</p>
        <p>But the two North Dakotans -- Mr. Conrad and Senator Byron L. Dorgan -- remained in the arena, both of them expressing concern about the impact of the balanced budget amendment on Social Security. The buzz kept building throughout the day, among senators, lobbyists, staff and the news media. The rumors flew about which Democrats were moving, and where; it was universally understood that few, if any, Democrats wanted to be the last to say no and thus carry the tag of amendment killer.</p>
        <p>Republicans were more than happy to muscle that point home as the day progressed and they were still trying to piece together 67 votes. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the always-effusive Republican whip, smiled ever so broadly in midafternoon and said he believed that the last Democratic vote would, somehow, appear. Otherwise, he said helpfully: "This will be on their back. I don't think they want it to end that way."</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorgan, for his part, simply shrugged when a reporter asked about the pressure. "Just got off the phone with my 5-year-old daughter," he replied, clearly reaching for some Zen state beyond the talk radio, the switchboard, the lobbyists. "She was eating a pear and talking about school."</p>
        <p>Throughout this debate, there was an immense amount of political calculation about the vote, a constant running subtext about political cover, political risk, how one position or another would be interpreted in the heat of a campaign. But in the closing arguments, members in both parties clearly saw the vote as something bigger, a watershed moment.  To its supporters, it was the culmination of a long conservative drive to rein in the Federal Government. To its opponents, a political gimmick that would deface the Constitution with a badly flawed amendment.</p>
        <p>That, perhaps, was what finally froze the field -- the sheer sense of historic weight. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who is floor manager for the amendment, said after the Senate adjourned in chaos tonight, "We need one more vote." He added that Republicans thought they had had an agreement with Mr. Conrad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conrad said there was no such agreement.</p>
        <p>The Senate broke as it had begun: at an impasse.</p>
