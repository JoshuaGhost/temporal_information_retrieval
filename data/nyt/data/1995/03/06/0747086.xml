        <p>Unless the value of the dollar goes into a free fall against major currencies, economists and portfolio managers say they do not expect its latest bout of weakness to have much impact on prices in American financial markets.</p>
        <p>That assessment would have been unthinkable during the latter 1980's, when Japanese investors financed a large chunk of the United States' soaring trade and budget deficits through purchases of everything from financial assets to real estate.

        <p>Unless the value of the dollar goes into a free fall against major currencies, economists and portfolio managers say they do not expect its latest bout of weakness to have much impact on prices in American financial markets.</p>
        <p>That assessment would have been unthinkable during the latter 1980's, when Japanese investors financed a large chunk of the United States' soaring trade and budget deficits through purchases of everything from financial assets to real estate. In those days, bond traders looked at any prolonged period of dollar weakness against the yen with genuine alarm.</p>
        <p>"The slightest possibility of a tumble in the dollar would have caused a problem for financial markets" back then, said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>But times have changed, and the American stock and bond markets have not only withstood the downward pressure on the dollar, but flourished, to the amazement of some analysts.</p>
        <p>"I don't understand how two-year Treasury notes can possibly be yielding 6.87 percent with the dollar collapsing," said David Buchen, a managing director at Citibank who is in charge of the bank's foreign exchange operations. "And I don't understand why, if people like marks so much, that 10-year German bonds are yielding about 7.35 percent while 10-year Treasuries are yielding just about the same thing. Asset markets and currency markets have been delinked."</p>
        <p>Since December, when the latest round of dollar-selling began, bond yields have fallen and stocks have risen to new peaks in the United States. Meanwhile, markets in Germany and Japan, the big countries with the world's strongest currencies, have either languished or slumped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchen and other analysts pin the dollar's recent slide on a number of developments.</p>
        <p>"The currency markets didn't like Alan Greenspan suggesting last month that the Fed might be done raising rates," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities. "It doesn't like the deal the United States did to rescue Mexico. And political problems elsewhere in Europe have been pushing a lot of money into German marks."</p>
        <p>But analysts say that a number of factors seem likely to protect American markets from feeling the sting of the dollar's slide.</p>
        <p>Most important, the analysts say, is that the United States has become less dependent on one main source of foreign capital to finance its deficits. Over the last few years, Japan has been replaced by central banks from a range of newly industrialized countries, many of them Asian, whose currencies are linked to the dollar.</p>
        <p>"In the 1980's, we needed the Japanese to finance the deficit; that is no longer the case," said Neal M. Soss of Soss &amp; Cotton Enterprises, a New York money management firm. "We have different bankers now, who for a range of reasons seem pretty content to stay tied to the dollar. I would be much more concerned if the dollar were much weaker against emerging-market currencies."</p>
        <p>Then, too, because of shifting trading patterns, Mr. Soss and other analysts said market fears of the inflationary effects of a weaker dollar were much less real now than before. The inflationary effect of a lower dollar would be much more profound if countries with strong currencies like Germany, Japan and Switzerland, were America's most important trading partners. They are not.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Canada and Mexico, which last year ranked first and third, respectively, in terms of bilateral trade with the United States, have currencies far weaker than the dollar. Moreover, to maintain market share, foreign companies based in strong-currency countries have either squeezed profit margins drastically or moved operations to the United States.</p>
        <p>All these factors, coupled with signs that the pace of economic expansion in the United States is slowing, make it very unlikely that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest rates to support the dollar.</p>
        <p>"In a slowing economy, a falling dollar is a good thing," Mr. Sinai said, "because it helps boost exports and damps import demand."</p>
        <p>And William H. Gross, a managing director at the Pacific Investment Management Company, a Newport Beach, Calif., money management firm with $60 billion in fixed-income assets under management, said the recent weakness in the dollar was a "negative for holders of long-term Treasuries, but not a negative for the overall level of interest rates."</p>
        <p>Dollar-related jitters may rattle in the credit markets for a short while, said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. Despite near-term caution, Mr. Resler said he remained a fan of dollar-denominated financial assets.</p>
        <p>"We were moving toward another month of improving prices and falling yields," he said. "But if I am a dollar-based investor, I want to keep my money invested in the U.S. stock and bond markets this year. Earnings look good, and interest rates will continue to come down as the economy continues to slow."</p>
