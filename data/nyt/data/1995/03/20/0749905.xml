        <p>There is one question the omnipresent television camera crews want answered as they hover with their headlamps, like miners in the dark cavernous show spaces: what are the trends?</p>
        <p>Looking for trends at the runway shows of Jean-Paul Gaultier, Vivienne Westwood, John Galliano and Karl Lagerfeld is a bit like going to the Museum of Modern Art and doggedly seeking paintings with flowers or trees.</p>
        <p>What makes these designers great is not the trends they create but how they have no use for them. If the trend is dead -- and for the most part, this season has offered few of them -- copying killed it. What has become more important is to show work so distinctive that what is appropriated is as valuable as a lump of lead that somewhat resembles a Henry Moore sculpture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gaultier created a post-apocalyptic Amazon this season, with women outfitted like surly survivors. His show opened with the spinning of a huge propeller over the stage and with a cloud of smoke, as two road warriors on a beat-up motorcycle careered down the runway. One with punked hair leapt off to scale huge scaffolding that was hung with glowing red coils.</p>
        <p>Tool belts swaggered at hips; huge poncho coats defied the elements; cat suits like those of speed skaters protected the body from head to toe, some with patterns of dots forming bikinis on the outside -- beach wear for an ozone-depleted world.</p>
        <p>The models' hair, too, protected them, Mad Max-style braids cascading down their bodies. Makeup like tribal tattoos covered their faces. There was every embodiment of the dangerous, indestructible woman as found in science fiction and on MTV, in long cavalier coats from bark-patterned leather, scuba-suit-fabric fitted zip suits and breastplates layered over long skirts. Mannish pin-striped suits had pelts flung over the shoulders. Even evening wear padded the bodies, with neon fabrics quilted as thickly as sleeping bags. It was a cool, caustic vision defying a future fraught with dangers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galliano created a dreamy rooftop covered with thick snow for his runway, with models posing amid weathervanes, skylights, rain gutters and television antennae. This, too, was a world of danger: a sailor with bare feet and red manicured toes leaned against a chimney,reading a book called "Killer in Drag," and another sailor brandished a gun. With a flimsy dress and a frightened face, Mr. Galliano's woman, unlike Mr. Gaultier's, was ill-equipped to deal with the snow, the sailors or the future.</p>
        <p>The muse this season was the fictional Dolores, whose tortured correspondence from the Rose of Alhambra hotel to her lover, Jaime, aboard the ocean liner Berengaria, along with a lock of hair and a broken locket, made up the show's evocative invitation. These were her clothes from luxurious leather-bound trunks: bias-cut slip dresses formed from a single scallop-edged piece of silk, crinkled organza flowers spilling across sculptured jackets and dress shoulders, a long black frock coat pleated perfectly down the back and sheer chiffon dresses with petals of fabric wilting gently across them.</p>
        <p>If last season's show by Mr. Galliano evoked a never-ending party, this show felt as though an all-night revel had rudely met the dawn, with dead Champagne, smudged makeup and the models longing to be safely home. Somehow, the beautiful, jaded aristocrat's clothes, so triumphantly fresh last season, made the audience feel a bit jaded, too, this time.</p>
        <p>Ms. Westwood staged a jolly romp titled "Vive la Cocotte," in which round bustled rumps jutted in one direction and built-up foundation bras jutted in the other. The designer, who took a tearful bow to a standing ovation, is working toward a silhouette in which, she said, the female form looks like a fashion drawing. The exaggerated S-curve created by padding top and bottom is modern, she said, "because the illusion does not rely on tight waisting."</p>
        <p>In passages like "La Cocotte Stops the Funicular Railway," "La Cocotte Fund-Raises for Charity" and "Dressed to Conquer," Ms. Westwood's femme fatales commandeered the runway atop six-inch-high boots, with dirndl skirt tugged high in the back, saucy-wench dress falling from the shoulder and foundation bra bursting from beneath tight button-front sweaters. There were tight Tyrolean jackets; a fake chinchilla suit with a furry bustier; a simple side-tied dress of shimmering red velvet; a bright tartan jacket with argyle leggings and white ruffle shirt. Everything had matching hats, shoes, handbags and jewelry.</p>
        <p>The program notes said, "It is clear that this return to formality in dress is a reaction against the sloppy mediocrity of our age." With that pronouncement, and with 86 outfits, each one a precise piece of tailoring, wit and attention to detail, Ms. Westwood continued her crusade, which somewhat resembles that of this season's muse, Ninon de Lenclos, the 17th-century French beauty and wit, whose prestige in her day, Ms. Westwood said, "resided in her integrity in being true to herself in an age when women conformed to stereotypes."</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld, designing for his own label, produced his strongest collection in many seasons. He provided not only the pieced severe suits that his clients collect, but offered a new sack-style silhouette in boxy jackets with three-quarter sleeves, and sack dresses that were held with straps or ribbons inside to tighten the top but leave the back loose to create a reverse decolletage.</p>
        <p>There were beautiful cream satin dresses cut on the bias, some worn with fitted satin men's formal-wear vests, and beautiful long black tulle- lined gowns with geometric patterns on top, some like flecked rice, some with bands or boxes across them. There were also colorful satin striped smoking jackets, long, with fake fur collars, and ballooning sheer chiffon poets' blouses worn with tight ribbed shorts.</p>
        <p>Three other fashion houses -- Fendi, Chloe and Chanel -- depend on this designer for trends every season, but this time he launched his newest idea, the sack silhouette, in the collection that bears his own name. Along with his strong signature pieces, it provided the best of both worlds: something for those who watch trends and something for those content to watch designers.</p>
