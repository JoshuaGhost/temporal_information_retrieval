        <p>Last October, a city housing inspector found and reported a crack in a wall of the Harlem apartment building that partly collapsed on Tuesday, a defect that private experts say could have been a sign of structural problems. But word of the crack never reached the city agency that is responsible for insuring buildings' structural integrity.</p>
        <p>The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development released the inspector's report yesterday, along with scores of others that read like a catalogue of decay and hazardous conditions. At the same time, lawyers for the department were in housing court arguing for large fines and a jail sentence for the building's owner, Marcus Lehman, and his former partner, Morris Wolfson.</p>

        <p>Last October, a city housing inspector found and reported a crack in a wall of the Harlem apartment building that partly collapsed on Tuesday, a defect that private experts say could have been a sign of structural problems. But word of the crack never reached the city agency that is responsible for insuring buildings' structural integrity.</p>
        <p>The city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development released the inspector's report yesterday, along with scores of others that read like a catalogue of decay and hazardous conditions. At the same time, lawyers for the department were in housing court arguing for large fines and a jail sentence for the building's owner, Marcus Lehman, and his former partner, Morris Wolfson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lehman and Mr. Wolfson appeared in court, but would not discuss the case with reporters.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan District Attorney's office began an investigation yesterday into the building collapse, which killed three people and injured seven others, with an eye toward possible criminal charges against Mr. Lehman and Mr. Wolfson.</p>
        <p>A housing inspector who visited the building, at 142 West 140th Street, on Oct. 26, noted in his report that there was a cracked wall in the building's cellar and first floor, along the east court. The wall that collapsed on Tuesday was on the east side of the building, but it is not clear from the inspector's report whether the cracked wall was the one that failed.</p>
        <p>It is also unclear whether any of the dozens of unsafe conditions documented by inspectors over a period of years should have served as a warning that the building was structurally unsound. But private experts said that a crack in a brick wall -- as opposed to cracked surface plaster -- might be a danger signal.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, Harold M. Shultz, a deputy housing commissioner, said he had spoken with the inspector who visited the building on Oct. 26, David Mompoint, and added, "He did not see any cracks." But Mr. Mompoint's report states, "North cracked wall, cellar and 1st sty level at east court."</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Shultz said he meant that Mr. Mompoint had not seen any structural problems. But the reports, which cover six years of inspections, also mentioned many other problems that could point to structural defects, including brick parapets that leaned four inches off-center, warped and uneven floors, doors that no longer fit their jambs and a retaining wall weakened by defective mortar.</p>
        <p>Housing inspectors, who have no engineering training, are responsible for quality-of-life issues like vermin infestation and lack of hot water. But they are also supposed to report signs of possible structural problems to the city's Buildings Department, which will inspect a building only if a complaint is made, by a housing inspector or anyone else. Last year, 160 such referrals were made, but the building on 140th Street was never reported to the Buildings Department.</p>
        <p>Vahe Tiryakian, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said he could not say whether the crack found in the Oct. 26 inspection should have been reported, "without us knowing the extent or exact location of the crack."</p>
        <p>"The inspector did feel that it was a maintenance item, and non-hazardous," he said.</p>
        <p>Benjamin Brafman, a lawyer for Mr. Lehman and Mr. Wolfson, said his clients should not be held responsible for potential problems that city experts overlooked.</p>
        <p>"If, in fact, a trained inspector whose job it is to determine whether cracks like these are potentially dangerous takes no action, then it suggests to me that it would be highly inappropriate to say that the owners of the building should be held criminally negligent," Mr. Brafman said.</p>
        <p>"It's clear that someone in the city dropped the ball," he said.</p>
        <p>Residents of the building have said that several signs of structural problems were obvious. Residents and people living across the street said that a large crack was visible from the outside in the wall that collapsed, and that steam could sometimes be seen rising from the fissure.</p>
        <p>Despite frequent inspections and citations, and five separate actions filed by the city against the owners in Housing Court, the building was a persistent source of complaints. The housing department had more than 900 violations cleared up, and had the owners fined $24,000 since 1989, yet another 337 violations, including 56 that are considered "immediately hazardous," remain.</p>
        <p>It was those violations, not the wall's collapse, that were the subject of yesterday's Housing Court hearing, which had been scheduled well before the collapse.</p>
        <p>Housing preservation lawyers urged Judge Peter M. Wendt to hold Mr. Wolfson and Mr. Lehman in criminal contempt for violating an order last June to correct the most serious violations, some of which date to 1989.</p>
        <p>"We are asking for jail time and $1 million in fines," said Mara Neville, speaking for the housing agency.</p>
        <p>But defense lawyers said the department was taking an unusually harsh line against Mr. Wolfson and Mr. Lehman because of the collapse, which they argued should remain a separate issue from the violations.</p>
        <p>"It should be made absolutely clear," said Mr. Brafman, "that these violations have nothing to do with the collapse."</p>
        <p>Mr. Brafman said the housing agency was moving toward a settlement before Tuesday's collapse, but department officials denied it.</p>
        <p>The inspection reports released yesterday showed that at least one inspector had serious concerns about the deterioration of the parapet along the roof. In January, 1993, the inspector, whose signature is illegible, sent notices addressed "to city-wide chief inspector" and "to construction division," saying, "I visited the above premises on 1/4/93 and observed north parapet walls out of plumb approx 4 inches at north west and north east roof."</p>
        <p>An inspection order issued three weeks ago showed that the problem still existed two years later, and mentions "broken or defective mortar joints of parapet wall at center north roof," first reported in 1985.</p>
        <p>A city law requires that building facades be regularly inspected by an engineer or architect, and that any condition that might cause debris to fall be corrected. But the inspection is required only for buildings of seven or more stories, one more than the building on 140th Street.</p>
        <p>Other reports refer to holes in floors and collapsing ceilings. But no reports document floors' separating from the walls that hold them up, which experts say may be the surest sign that a building may collapse. Tenants have said that in some apartments, there were wide gaps between walls and floors.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, yesterday began investigating the collapse and sought residents of the building to interview. The investigation is intended "to determine whether criminal negligence played any role in the building collapse and the resulting deaths," said Daniel Castleman, Mr. Morgenthau's chief of investigation.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Morgenthau's request, a grand jury issued a series of subpoenas, but officials would not say what was being sought. A grand jury will not be asked for some time to vote on charges, they said.</p>
        <p>The most likely charge to result from the investigation, said a law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity, is criminally negligent homicide, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 1 1/3 to 4 years in state prison. He said there was a more remote chance of a charge of second-degree manslaughter, with a maximum sentence of 5 to 15 years, if prosecutors could show the owners recklessly disregarded dangerous conditions.</p>
