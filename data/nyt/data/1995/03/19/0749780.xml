        <p>Having exhibited at the MOMA, lived the corporate life and written a few obscure historical novels, I venture a view on the visual fine arts, prompted by your feature article about the Whitney Biennial ("The Art of His Choosing," by Paul Goldberger, Feb. 26).</p>

        <p>Having exhibited at the MOMA, lived the corporate life and written a few obscure historical novels, I venture a view on the visual fine arts, prompted by your feature article about the Whitney Biennial ("The Art of His Choosing," by Paul Goldberger, Feb. 26).</p>
        <p>Major art has always been a result of its times and technology: cave paintings, bas-relief, mosaic, wood panel, stained glass, fresco and canvas, all logically static and mute.</p>
        <p>The Whitney's choices and such ilk are eclectic, anachronistic and trivial, destined to become minor art, if art at all. Imagine a 25th-century archeologist unearthing a signed mattress, a Pollock and then a Pompeian mosaic -- or a preserved video disk.</p>
        <p>Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism and installations will be historic footnotes . . .  lifeless, selfish interpretations of a moving and sonorous world. JOHN VAN ZWIENEN Worcester, Mass.</p>
