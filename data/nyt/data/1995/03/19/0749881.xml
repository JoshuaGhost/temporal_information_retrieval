        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The main reason there is a need for animal rescuers in New York City ("Humans to the Rescue," March 5) is because of the failure of the tax-supported system that is supposed to humanely and intelligently address the cat and dog overpopulation problem -- a system now embodied in the Center for Animal Care and Control. Accepting the truth about this failed system instead of taking a defensive posture would be a gesture of good faith by the center. Smoke and mirrors will do nothing to change an essentially rotten core.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The main reason there is a need for animal rescuers in New York City ("Humans to the Rescue," March 5) is because of the failure of the tax-supported system that is supposed to humanely and intelligently address the cat and dog overpopulation problem -- a system now embodied in the Center for Animal Care and Control. Accepting the truth about this failed system instead of taking a defensive posture would be a gesture of good faith by the center. Smoke and mirrors will do nothing to change an essentially rotten core.</p>
        <p>For example, while the 18 percent adoption rate of the center's predecessor was unacceptable, the center's position that it will "reduce killing by increasing adoptions" is naive. The only way to reduce the euthanasia rate is to reduce births. That means low-cost and accessible spay/neuter clinics and the passage of breeding control legislation, like that now before the City Council.</p>
        <p>For every dollar invested in municipal spay/neuter clinics, $10 is saved in future animal control costs. It's essentially the taxpayers' choice -- to continue to pay the high and immoral cost of killing behind closed doors or to make a humane commitment to the future.
