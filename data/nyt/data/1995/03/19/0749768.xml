        <p>Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman leaned back in a plastic chair in the visiting room of the downtown Metropolitan Correctional Center on Friday, slowly rubbing his hands across the stomach of his Government-issue blue khaki uniform, his red fez, wrapped in white cloth, the only outward sign that he was a Muslim preacher.</p>
        <p>He had prepared carefully for the interview, printing notes in Arabic Braille on a large piece of paper, which he now read with his fingers.</p>
        <p>Most of his points were the disclaimers that could be expected. He said he did not believe that any disclosures over the last two months in Federal Court in Manhattan were enough to prove the prosecution's contention that his religious pronouncements incited violence.</p>
        <p>The Government presented some of its strongest evidence against Mr. Abdel Rahman last week, reading from a taped conversation in which he advised Emad A. Salem, a Government informer, not to bomb the United Nations but to concentrate on American military installations. He also told Mr. Salem to put off an attack on the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Abdel Rahman noted that the other suspects continued talking on tape about the plot to blow up the United Nations even after saying that he had advised against it. "After this, how can I be considered the head of a group that listens to me and carries out what I order?" he asked.</p>
        <p>He said he was sure that Mr. Salem was planted in the United States in a joint effort by this Government and Egypt's to silence his political views. "They wanted me thrown into prison here so I could not promote my cause in fighting the Egyptian system, so I cannot criticize this system," he said. "Call it an exchange of favors."</p>
        <p>Finally, the sheik said, he does not believe that a man being paid more than $1 million for his testimony will be credible. "The testimony of Emad Salem as the main witness is the testimony of a mercenary," he said, adding, "It is the testimony the Government wants and not the truth."</p>
        <p>Regardless, he professed to be unconcerned about the outcome.  "Whether they rule for me or against me I must accept it with a clear conscience," he said, adding that he thought the stereotypes broadcast and printed about Muslims made it difficult to get a fair trial here.</p>
        <p>A moment later, the room filled with an electronic wailing. Mr. Abdel Rahman suddenly started and said it was time for him to leave. A watch, equipped with a small speaker and tucked into the breast pocket of his prison uniform, was issuing the opening lines of the call usually emitted from minarets around the world.</p>
        <p>It was time for noon prayers. The interview was over.</p>
