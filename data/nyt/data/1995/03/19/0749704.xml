        <p>Slovakia, which recently celebrated its second anniversary of independence, is stumbling toward democracy and an open economy as Europe's youngest nation.</p>
        <p>It has had three Governments, two of which have been led by the current Prime Minister, Vladimir Meciar, who in his determination not to lose power again has shown an authoritarian bent that alarms the opposition, foreign governments and potential investors.</p>
        <p>Yet basic political freedoms are still respected, and as people come to terms with the double shock of abandoning first Communism and then the 74-year union with the Czech Republic, Slovakia's political culture is slowly maturing in ways that many politicians and diplomats say will assure the country of a bright future, if Mr. Meciar can curb his anti-democratic impulses.</p>
        <p>"It's only been two years since the country was founded, and people here are still trying to figure out who they are," said Rick Zednick, a Slovak-American who recently helped start Bratislava's first English-language newspaper. "They are looking into themselves and at their history and asking themselves what it really means to be Slovak."</p>
        <p>With low labor costs, a skilled work force among 5.4 million people, a location at the heart of Europe and an emerging generation of young entrepreneurs, Slovakia should be poised for an economic takeoff. Continuing political uncertainty, however, has hurt the country's image and scared off some investors.</p>
        <p>Early this month, 10 newspapers across the country published nearly blank front pages to protest threats from members of Mr. Meciar's party to impose sharply increased taxes that could force them out of business. The front pages carried a statement asserting that the proposed increases "threaten the work of the press in Slovakia and the right of Slovak citizens to choose their sources of information."</p>
        <p>Faced with criticism at home and abroad, leaders of Mr. Meciar's party disavowed the proposal, and it was killed by a parliamentary committee. Yet many fear that he will strike again.</p>
        <p>"Meciar's method is to hit us and see if he can get away with it," said Oliver Brunovsky, an editor of the business newspaper Trend. "This time it didn't work, but he'll keep trying."</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, after reassuming power in December 1994 in a coalition Government, Mr. Meciar arranged to remove the directors of the state radio and television networks and the Government news agency, replacing them with political allies.</p>
        <p>Coverage of opposition activities has been curbed, and three satirical programs were taken off the air. Several thousand people showed up this month for a rally in Bratislava to protest the changes.</p>
        <p>But despite the heavy-handedness by Mr. Meciar, who was Slovakia's Prime Minister before independence, few citizens fear that their new democracy is under imminent threat. In an indication of the country's direction, for instance, Slovakia has signed agreements with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund that require it to observe basic levels of political and economic freedom.</p>
        <p>"What's going on here is nothing like what's going on in some other parts of Central and Eastern Europe," a foreign diplomat said. "Meciar is a very skillful populist politician and a bit of an opportunist, but the 'former Communist' stuff is vastly overplayed. It fits in Poland, maybe in Hungary and certainly in the Balkans, but here there's a very different dynamic."</p>
        <p>Some Slovak intellectuals are more worried about the country's future, however.</p>
        <p>"Everything we did in the 1980's was aimed at destroying the system, chipping away at the cement that held it together," said Martin Simecka, a novelist and former dissident.</p>
        <p>"Now Meciar is doing exactly what we did, chipping away at the established order," he said. "All he thinks about is how to bring down the democratic system. My instinct is that things will get worse here. I'm afraid that in a year, we will be closer to a real dictatorship."</p>
        <p>Mr. Meciar's support comes principally from rural, less-educated and older voters, many of whom look back fondly on the security of life under Communism. Even his critics acknowledge that he is Slovakia's best politician and that the opposition has no one to challenge him.</p>
        <p>Among Mr. Meciar's favorite targets is President Michal Kovac, who helped engineer the Prime Minister's fall from power a year ago. Mr. Meciar, 52, is waging a guerrilla war against Mr. Kovac, pushing through a series of parliamentary measures aimed at reducing his powers.</p>
        <p>In an interview, the soft-spoken President said he disapproved of Mr. Meciar's attacks on the press, but asserted that the country's democracy was not in danger.</p>
        <p>"I'm not happy about the situation," Mr. Kovac said. "It's hard when the President thinks certain steps could improve the country's credibility but does not have the legal power to take those steps."</p>
        <p>As Slovakia's approached independence in late 1992, many people assumed that its most prominent citizen, Alexander Dubcek, would be elected the first president.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dubcek, who won international acclaim for trying to lead Czechoslovakia out of the Soviet orbit in 1968, died of injuries from a car crash in 1992. His death deprived Slovakia of the one figure who might have won it the respect that has been accorded to the Czech Republic.</p>
        <p>"The problem is that from the beginning, people looked at the split in a very simplified way," said Eduard Kukan, a former Foreign Minister.</p>
        <p>"The Czechs were good, the Slovaks were bad. We were looked at as spoilers who ruined the unity of the country. The fact is that both sides realized the split was inevitable, but the Czechs prepared for it quietly. Slovaks are more emotional. We shouted.</p>
        <p>"We are seen as less sophisticated, less developed, and less educated, some of which may be true," he continued. "Then of course, the Czechs had Vaclav Havel, who is greatly admired in the West. We had Meciar, who is not a very lovable guy."</p>
        <p>The last Slovak Government, which held power for nine months in 1994, won widespread praise not only for its commitment to democracy but also for its determination to privatize formerly state-owned enterprises. Mr. Meciar has slowed the pace of privatization, and critics suspect that he is seeking to shape the process so it will benefit his supporters. Already, they say, Government officials often ask for "commissions" in exchange for contracts.</p>
        <p>"Nobody believes that Meciar himself is getting money," Mr. Kukan said, "but he is arranging things so that his supporters get the biggest slices of the pie."</p>
        <p>Mr. Meciar rarely receives foreign journalists, but an official of the Economics Ministry, Jozef Sucha, said the Government remains committed to completing Slovakia's transition to a market economy.</p>
        <p>"I myself am not pleased with the state of affairs, but I can assure you that the process of privatization will proceed," Mr. Sucha said. "All parties favor it. I realize that the delays look bad from the outside, but we are determined to wipe away the old system. The discussion is not about whether, but how."</p>
        <p>Several large foreign companies, among them Volkswagen and Samsung, have opened plants in Slovakia and say they are pleased with the results. Others, however, are waiting for the political situation to stabilize.</p>
        <p>"Persuading foreign investors to come to Slovakia is a difficult job," said Peter Mihok, president of the Slovak Chamber of Commerce. "There have been so many changes here in the last few years, and the political situation is still fluid."</p>
        <p>Lubo Roman, a prominent theater director and member of Parliament, is one of many opposition figures who believe that Mr. Meciar's mercurial personality is hindering the consolidation of democracy here.</p>
        <p>"He is a politician who thrives on keeping everything in tension, but he is not a man with a vision of how Slovakia should develop and what it should be about," he said. "We are waiting for a person with new ideas to give the country direction. Everyone here who is culturally minded is waiting for such a person."</p>
