        <p>Last Monday, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council agreed to strict new zoning rules for sex-related businesses. Which targets are affected -- be they X-rated video stores, topless bars or other "adult" establishemnts -- hinges on the city's definition of "specified sexual activities" and "specified anatomical areas." The rules are expected to take effect before the end of the year. THE DEFINITIONS</p>

        <p>"Specified anatomical areas" are: (i) less than completely and opaquely concealed: (a) human genitals, pubic region, (b) human buttock, anus, or (c) female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola; or (ii) human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, evein if completely and apaquely concealed.</p>
        <p>HOW THEY ARE USED</p>
        <p>(c) An adult eating or drinking establishment is an eating or drinking establishment which regularly features any one or more of the following:</p>
        <p>(1) live performances that are characterized by an emphasis on "specified anatomical areas" or "specified sexual activities"; or,</p>
        <p>(2) films, motion pictures, videocassettes, slides or other photographic reproductions that are characterized by an emphasis upon the depiction or description of "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas"; or,</p>
        <p>(3) employees who, as part of their employment, customarily expose to patrons "specified anatomical areas."  (d) An adult theater is a commercial establishment that regularly features one or more of the following:</p>
        <p>(1) films, motion pictures, videocassettes, slides or similar photographic reproductions characterized by an emphasis on the depiction or description of "specified sexual activities" or "specified anatomical areas"; or,</p>
