        <p>Willis Reed said today that Kenny Anderson's criticism of Coach Butch Beard was the result of an "an injury thing" and compared it to something Reed experienced as a Knick.</p>
        <p>Reed recalled his own frustration when he missed the sixth game of the 1969-70 championship final against the Los Angeles Lakers. "I hated it," the general manager said. "I was happy for my teammates, but I wanted to be on the floor. I wasn't used to watching. I think that is what Kenny's going through right now. He's always been at the top of his game, physically. This is all new to him."</p>

        <p>Willis Reed said today that Kenny Anderson's criticism of Coach Butch Beard was the result of an "an injury thing" and compared it to something Reed experienced as a Knick.</p>
        <p>Reed recalled his own frustration when he missed the sixth game of the 1969-70 championship final against the Los Angeles Lakers. "I hated it," the general manager said. "I was happy for my teammates, but I wanted to be on the floor. I wasn't used to watching. I think that is what Kenny's going through right now. He's always been at the top of his game, physically. This is all new to him."</p>
        <p>Anderson had wrist surgery during the off season and then missed most of the preseason with a hamstring injury. Since the season began, he has been bothered by recurring soreness in his wrist, the flu and the same hamstring injury.</p>
        <p>He drew Beard's wrath after complaining about his playing time in the Nets' 108-86 loss to Chicago on Monday. He shot 1 for 8 and committed 7 turnovers in 33 minutes.</p>
        <p>Beard spoke to Anderson before today's practice at Fairleigh Dickinson. "We talked about it and he knows how I feel," Beard said. "He has to learn to put his personal problems aside. I'm happy to sit down and discuss it with him, but he has to work things out on his own."</p>
        <p>Anderson said he had not played well during the last three games.</p>
        <p>"I think it's a frustration thing," Beard said. "He knows he wasn't playing well. With 25 games left, I need my best people out on the floor. If he's not playing well, he has to understand that."</p>
        <p>The result, according to Beard, "was a good, intense practice." He added: "There was a lot of energy on the floor today. We need more of these practices down the stretch."</p>
        <p>Reed and Beard agreed that for the Nets to make the playoffs -- they're fighting for the last berth with Miami and Boston -- they'll need Anderson on the court.</p>
        <p>"We know that Kenny and Derrick Coleman are our reference points," Reed said. "Other guys will step it up from game to game, but these are our go-to guys. We need them, night in and night out, doing their thing, and doing it well."</p>
        <p>Beard added: "We know what he's capable of. Kenny gets a lot of credit when we win and a lot blame when we lose. He just has to accept that. We need him to work out his problems and play like he's capable."</p>
        <p>"We control our own destiny," Reed said. "If Kenny starts playing better and we start winning, I think the personal problems will go away.</p>
        <p>"He doesn't want to accept that it's an injury thing. He wants to be competitive and he's not used to being hampered by injuries. Last year, he was 100 percent and he was an All-Star. This season, he's had the injuries."  PRO BASKETBALL</p>
