        <p>A fire filled the New York Palace Hotel with smoke yesterday morning and played havoc with the wiring of the mid-Manhattan high-rise, sending guests and hotel workers, clad in everything from minks to shorts and borrowed blankets, groping down dark hallways and stairwells and streaming into the streets.</p>
        <p>Guests described a sometimes disorderly evacuation, with no alarms sounding on some floors and hotel workers telling people, even after the alarms had sounded, to stay in their rooms. Short circuits caused lights to wink on and off throughout the hotel and ignited a number of smaller fires, prompting Consolidated Edison to cut off power to most of the 53-story building.</p>

        <p>A fire filled the New York Palace Hotel with smoke yesterday morning and played havoc with the wiring of the mid-Manhattan high-rise, sending guests and hotel workers, clad in everything from minks to shorts and borrowed blankets, groping down dark hallways and stairwells and streaming into the streets.</p>
        <p>Guests described a sometimes disorderly evacuation, with no alarms sounding on some floors and hotel workers telling people, even after the alarms had sounded, to stay in their rooms. Short circuits caused lights to wink on and off throughout the hotel and ignited a number of smaller fires, prompting Consolidated Edison to cut off power to most of the 53-story building.</p>
        <p>The fire was probably started accidentally by workers on the fifth floor, who were working on the air-conditioning and electrical systems, fire officials said. They said the three-alarm fire, which began about 9:30 A.M., spread to an electrical conduit connecting several floors, causing arcing that set fires on the sixth and seventh floors and ignited garbage in the basement.</p>
        <p>While 61 people were treated for smoke inhalation and minor injuries in a makeshift infirmary in the middle of Madison Avenue, hundreds of people who were in the hotel took refuge in neighboring St. Patrick's Cathedral, mingling with worshipers who were there for Ash Wednesday services. Among those treated, eight firefighters, one emergency medical technician and nine other people, all suffering from smoke inhalation, were taken to area hospitals, but none were seriously injured, said David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the Emergency Medical Service.</p>
        <p>Outside the hotel -- known as the Helmsley Palace until it was bought last year by the royal family of Brunei -- dazed guests and hotel employees joined curious pedestrians on Madison and on 50th and 51st Streets, all weaving their way through a tangle of hoses and fire trucks and other emergency vehicles. Madison Avenue was blocked for several hours, as were 50th and 51st Streets between Madison and Park Avenue, making the usually obstreperous midtown traffic all the worse.</p>
        <p>Alice Morris, a slight woman visiting from England, wore a borrowed bellhop's jacket that hung almost to her knees as she stood, shivering, outside the hotel's south face. She was looking for her husband, Christopher, who had been at a meeting a few blocks away when the fire broke out, and wondering whether they would be allowed back into their hotel room in time to get their bags, airline tickets and passports, and catch an afternoon flight home.</p>
        <p>"I wasn't dressed" when the fire began, Mrs. Morris, 31, said. "I just put some clothes on and grabbed a handbag and ran out."</p>
        <p>She said her only warning that there was anything wrong came from a commotion caused by other guests in the hall outside her 27th-floor room. "There were no fire alarms on my floor," and no alerts from hotel employees, she said.</p>
        <p>With a group of other guests, she felt her way down a stairwell that was thick with smoke. "We put our hands over our mouths and noses, and those who had the foresight -- I was not one -- had wet cloths," she said. "It was all quite frightening."</p>
        <p>The hotel's clients, many of whom are from abroad, pay $250 to $1,200 a night for their lodgings. The 963-room hotel is owned by Amedeo Hotels, a Brunei investment company. The Palace was 70 percent occupied on Tuesday night, said Richard Chambers, a hotel spokesman, but many of the guests were not in the building when the fire began.</p>
        <p>Rose Rice, 21, and Cheryl Seufert, 22, who were on the 41st floor being interviewed for graduate programs at the California School of Professional Psychology, said that after the first fire alarm sounded, a voice over a public address system told them to stay where they were.</p>
        <p>"We left the building because we smelled smoke, not because they told us to leave the building," Ms. Seufert, who graduated last month from Rutgers University, said as she stood outside in the cold, wrapped in a pink hotel tablecloth.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chambers, the hotel spokesman, said an announcement telling people not to leave was in keeping with the hotel's policy. "That's the safest thing they can do, stay in their hotel room," he said. "Our first priority is to determine the location and the severity of the alarm."</p>
        <p>He said that the extent of the fire was not clear at first and that the Fire Department did not order evacuation of the building until 11 A.M., an hour and 35 minutes after the first alarm was sounded. Fire officials said they could not pinpoint the time of evacuation.</p>
        <p>All of the dozens of guests who were interviewed said that there never was an evacuation announcement but that they figured out for themselves that they should leave, or that other guests, hotel workers or firefighters told them to do so. Mr. Chambers would not say whether there was such an announcement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rice, a cadet lieutenant at West Point, said that below the 25th floor, the group she was in encountered heavy smoke in the stairwell, "and it got very hard to breathe." Before they reached the sixth floor, the lights went out, she said, "and this is when people started coming up with gas masks to get us out."</p>
        <p>Deborah Szelepski, 22, who was visiting from Argentina, said her first sign that something was amiss came when the lights in her room went off.</p>
        <p>Unfamiliar with American customs, Ms. Szelepski said she thought her services were being cut because she was scheduled to check out yesterday. "I said, 'It's very strange because the checkout isn't supposed to be until 1:00.' "</p>
