        <p>William Del Toro's attempt to win his brother's State Assembly seat in East Harlem ended in a crushing upset last night at the hands of Francisco Diaz Jr., the manager of Community Board 11 and a neighborhood political organizer.</p>
        <p>The 68th Assembly District seat had been held for 20 years by Angelo Del Toro, a Democrat and former head of the Assembly's Education Committee, before his death in December from a heart attack.</p>
        <p>His older brother William, a minister running on the Democratic line, had tried to continue the family dynasty, but was hobbled by having served time in prison for bribery and perjury and by a lackluster campaign.</p>
        <p>The special election was one of five legislative races around the state yesterday. Republicans won two Assembly seats and two Senate seats, though the balance of power in Albany was unchanged.</p>
        <p>With 99 percent of the vote reported in the 68th District special election, Mr. Diaz had 59 percent, or 5,080 votes, while Mr. Del Toro had 35 percent, or 3,016 votes. George L. Espada, the Republican candidate, had 6 percent of the vote, or 523 votes.</p>
        <p>Turnout in the race was surprisingly high, the result of intensive get-out-the-vote efforts by Mr. Diaz, who ran on the Liberal and Independence Fusion party lines. Most political observers had predicted that no more than 5,000 voters would show up at the polls, based on previous voting patterns, but the final tally was closer to 8,500.</p>
        <p>"We knocked on doors, we made phone calls, we had people telling others in the community how important it was to end the Del Toro regime," Mr. Diaz said in an interview last night after his victory. "East Harlem wanted change and we got it. This neighborhood is free at last."</p>
        <p>Mr. Diaz had received the support of several prominent political leaders, including the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger; former Mayor David N. Dinkins, and United States Representative Charles E. Rangel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Del Toro had little political support beyond the Democratic Party endorsement and a cadre of voters loyal to his brother. Though he had been considered the front-runner in the race, he did little public campaigning and rarely answered questions from news organizations. He could not be reached for comment last night.</p>
        <p>He served time in prison in 1974 after being convicted of bribery and perjury in a scheme to bribe a Model Cities program official. The bribery conviction was later overturned.</p>
        <p>On Long Island, in the 5th Senate District left vacant by the resignation of Ralph J. Marino, Carl L. Marcellino, the Republican town clerk of Oyster Bay, defeated Mary A. McCaffery, a Democrat who works as a fund-raiser for nonprofit agencies. Mr. Marino, a Republican who was deposed as majority leader in November, had represented the district on the Nassau-Suffolk line since 1969.</p>
        <p>In the 2d Assembly District on the South Fork, Fred W. Thiele Jr., the Southampton town supervisor and a former Suffolk County legislator who had the Republican nomination, defeated Leo P. Davis, a lawyer who was the Democratic candidate. Mr. Thiele succeeds former Assemblyman John L. Behan, a Republican appointed State Commissioner of Veterans' Affairs by Gov. George E.  Pataki.</p>
        <p>In the Niagara Falls area, David Seaman, a Republican and former Niagara County District Attorney, defeated two other candidates to replace Elizabeth Hoffman, a Republican, for the 139th Assembly District seat.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hoffman, who resigned her seat, was defeated in her attempt on the Conservative line to fill the Senate seat of John Daly, a Republican recently named State Transportation Commissioner by Governor Pataki. The winner was George D. Maziarz, the county clerk of Niagara County and a Republican.</p>
