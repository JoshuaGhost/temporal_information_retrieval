        <p>He came to Florida pursuing a fantasy. Dave Shotkoski, who had been out of baseball for nearly three years, jumped at the chance to be an Atlanta Braves replacement player, taking vacation time from his job as a production supervisor for a Coca-Cola bottling plant near Chicago.</p>
        <p>On Friday night, it all turned out wrong when the 30-year-old pitcher was fatally shot in the head in what was apparently a robbery attempt several blocks from the Ramada Inn where the team is staying.</p>
        <p>The Braves canceled today's spring training game against the Montreal Expos, as well as all workouts. They also offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Shotkoski's killer.</p>
        <p>Shotkoski, who is survived by his wife, Felicia, and an 8-month-old daughter, Alexis, had pitched just one inning for the Braves this spring.</p>
        <p>And before this spring, the 6-foot-3-inch, 175-pound right-hander from North Aurora, Ill., had been out of baseball since March 1992, when he was released by the California Angels after going 5-11 with a 4.28 earned run average for their Class AA Midland team. Over all, in seven minor league seasons, he was 18-24 with a 5.07 e.r.a. over 122 games. The highest level he reached was Class AAA Tacoma.</p>
        <p>Still, someone who has any notion of how to pitch is in demand this spring. And the Braves, who had taken him in the fourth round in the 1985 draft, called and invited him to Florida.</p>
        <p>And it proceeded from there, until Friday night.</p>
        <p>Shotkoski's roommate, Ryan Martin, a catcher, said Shotkoski liked to take a walk every evening after dinner. And it was during that walk that he was shot in the head.</p>
        <p>Sgt. John English of the West Palm Beach Police Department said one witness said she heard three shots and that Shotkoski's assailant was riding a yellow bicycle. A blood trail led to Shotkoski's body on Australian Avenue.</p>
        <p>"There is nothing to indicate anything but that it was an attempted robbery," English said today, although he said Shotkoski's wallet and jewelry were not taken.</p>
        <p>"He did everything by the book," Martin said of Shotkoski. "In bed at 10:30 every night. He was down here for a purpose. He told me he came down here to help his family out, get ahead financially.</p>
        <p>"He helped me through some rough times. It's tough down here. You're away from home, and if you don't do real well, you can really get down. He'd tell me how to get through it, what he went through."  BASEBALL</p>
