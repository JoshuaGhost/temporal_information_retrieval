        <p>The greens are turning blue. Golfers are turning red. Knuckles are getting white. Suddenly, it's as though the United States Golf Association flag went up outside the futuristic clubhouse here at the T.P.C. at Sawgrass and the Players Championship turned into a United States Open -- complete with palm trees, alligators and corporate sky boxes.</p>
        <p>On a day when par was once again a very good score, that is exactly what Corey Pavin shot to maintain a share of the lead. He scratched, scrapped and putted his way around the golf course in 72 strokes and is tied for the lead at a five-under-par 211 with Bernhard Langer, who shot 71.</p>

        <p>The greens are turning blue. Golfers are turning red. Knuckles are getting white. Suddenly, it's as though the United States Golf Association flag went up outside the futuristic clubhouse here at the T.P.C. at Sawgrass and the Players Championship turned into a United States Open -- complete with palm trees, alligators and corporate sky boxes.</p>
        <p>On a day when par was once again a very good score, that is exactly what Corey Pavin shot to maintain a share of the lead. He scratched, scrapped and putted his way around the golf course in 72 strokes and is tied for the lead at a five-under-par 211 with Bernhard Langer, who shot 71.</p>
        <p>It has been a war of attrition, like any Open or, for that matter, any major championship. Some major names have crept into contention -- Lee Janzen, the 1993 United States Open champion, is just one stroke behind at four under par after his round of 69. Payne Stewart, the 1991 United States Open champion, is two strokes behind after shooting 71.</p>
        <p>"It's something like a mixture between a United States Open and a PGA Championship," said Pavin. "Or maybe the Masters with a little bit of rough. Sort of like all the majors rolled into one."</p>
        <p>Sort of. The combination of hard, fast greens, sharp edges, winds and all the assorted water hazards has turned the course that Pete Dye built back into an authentic monster. It consumed its share of contenders today. Nick Price was one under par and very much in the picture as he stood on the tee at the dreaded 17th hole. He then hit two balls into the water and wound up with a triple bogey. Price, probably golf's most gracious man, was so furious when he finished his round that he actually snapped at reporters. It was the first time anyone had witnessed anything like it.</p>
        <p>Then there was poor Gene Sauers, who had shared the overnight lead with Pavin. His suffering began at the 10th hole, which he four-putted for double bogey. He righted himself with a birdie at the 11th, but the 17th and 18th ate him alive. He hit it in the water at both holes, finished double, double and had a 78 to show for all his toil and trouble.</p>
        <p>"Man, it is really tough out there," Stewart said when he was asked if the conditions were reminiscent of the Open. "It does have all the characteristics."</p>
        <p>Then he started giggling, incongruently, like someone who had been out in the sun and the wind too long. "Except the rough's not high enough. Yeah, it's only four or five inches high. It's not high enough."</p>
        <p>Well-struck shots were rejected by greens that, by the end of the day, were harder than mahogany. Stewart had a wedge shot into the 10th green and wound up making a double bogey when the ball wouldn't hold. Langer hit a perfect 3-iron shot into the eighth hole -- a brutal par three of 215 yards that yielded no birdies all day -- and his shot took two hops and bounced into a horrible spot in the back bunker. He had no green to work with, and what little he had sloped severely away from him.</p>
        <p>But then he demonstrated why he is the only player in the field to have been under par in all three rounds of the tournament. He played a deft bunker shot that rolled 10 feet past the hole, a miraculous escape, like chipping a ball from the top of the stairs and stopping it halfway down. He made that putt, overcame a bogey at the 10th with consecutive birdies at the 11th and 12th and then rolled in a 78-footer for birdie at the 15th hole.</p>
        <p>"Right in the center, too," he said with a smile. "How lucky can you get."</p>
        <p>That's what this sort of setup requires -- patience, skill and a little bit of luck every now and then. Pavin has had all three elements in his three days atop the leader board. He has made par putts from every corner of St. Johns County. The question is how long that can continue.</p>
        <p>This is what the players wanted their championship to be. Greg Norman's 24-under-par rampage last year, accomplished by a man at the peak of his powers on a golf course that was soft and pliable, seems a surreal and distant memory now.</p>
        <p>What remains will be a pitched battle, with good friends Pavin and Langer going head to head and the rest of the field nipping at their heels. The Players Championship has been trying since it moved here in 1982 to be regarded as golf's fifth major. It might never achieve that. But it has moved closer. Because the winning score on Sunday night will probably be less than 10 under par. And that's a score that would win more Opens than it would lose.  GOLF</p>
