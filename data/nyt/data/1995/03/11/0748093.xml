        <p>After more than 40 years, double-decker coaches will return to regular service on the Long Island Rail Road in 1997, railroad officials announced today.</p>
        <p>The board of the Metropolitan Transportation Association today approved the purchase of 114 two-level cars, which will seat 142 riders, compared with 120 on the current single-level cars.</p>
        <p>The new coaches, equipped with cellular phones and electronic message boards to announce stations, will replace cars that, on average, are almost 40 years old. They will signal the return of double deckers, which last ran on the L.I.R.R. in the mid-1950's. While two-level cars are used in the Chicago area, they are not used anywhere else on the East Coast.</p>
        <p>The new cars will be able to operate anywhere on the railroad, including the tunnels in New York City, but they will be used primarily on the lines that are not electrified, including the Port Jefferson branch east of Huntington, the Montauk branch east of Babylon, the Oyster Bay branch and the Ronkonkoma branch east of Ronkonkoma.</p>
        <p>"These cars are long overdue," said Sheldon Schachter, chairman of the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council, "but it's better late than never, unless you're among the commuters who still have to ride in the old cars."</p>
        <p>The railroad, with peak-hour ridership totaling 104,500, has been testing 10 prototypes of the two-level cars for three years. Four of the cars run daily on its Port Jefferson branch attached to the 5:44 to Penn Station in the morning and the 4:50 from Penn Station in the evening.</p>
        <p>Comments from commuters have led to major changes, however, mainly involving the seats, said Susan McGowan, a spokeswoman for the railroad.</p>
        <p>There were 180 seats on the prototype, two on one side of the aisle and three on the other. On the new cars, there will be fewer, larger seats.</p>
        <p>The digital message boards will complement a public address system, providing the name of the next station, reasons for delays and advance notice of schedule changes. Electronic signs on the outside of each car will provide the same information for commuters waiting on station platforms.</p>
        <p>The new cars will be nearly 83 feet long, a few feet shorter than most cars on the railroad, and 14 feet, 6 inches high, or approximately one foot higher than other cars, but well within clearance of the tunnels under the East River and into Penn Station, Ms. McGowan said. All coaches on the line are 10 feet wide.</p>
        <p>The new cars will be built by Mitsui and Company U.S.A., which has been awarded a $ 179.5 million contract that stipulates that at least 35 percent of the work will be performed by companies in New York State.</p>
        <p>Mitsui, based in Japan, will subcontract with Kawasaki Heavy Industries to build the coaches, which will be assembled in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Among the losing bidders was American Coach and Car Inc. of New York, which was backed by some elected officials and business leaders on Long Island because American Coach said it could assemble the cars at a former Grumman plant in Calverton, L.I.</p>
        <p>But a consulting firm concluded that American Coach, a subsidiary of Deutsche Waggonbau A.G. of Germany, had no experience with meeting Federal Railroad Administration standards, clearing the way for the choice of Mitsui.</p>
        <p>The railroad also announced today that it would buy 23 new diesel engines from the Electro-Motive division of General Motors under a $ 70.7 million contract.</p>
        <p>General Motors will assemble the locomotives in the Schenectady area, with New York State companies receiving 25 percent of the locomotive contract work.</p>
        <p>Five of the subcontractors for both the locomotives and the cars are based on Long Island. The Telephonics Corporation of Huntington will build the on-board communications systems; Lin Industries of Westbury will make interior components for the two-level coaches, and the Johnco Trucking Corporation of East Meadow will provide transportation services for coach parts.</p>
        <p>Two companies in Valley Stream will also benefit as subcontractors. ACS Associates Inc. will provide ocean transport for the car bodies manufactured in Japan, while BBA Project Inc. will provide project management and courier services.</p>
        <p>Correction:  March 14, 1995, Tuesday</p>
        <p>An article on Saturday about the Long Island Rail Road's purchase of double-decker coaches referred incorrectly to the places where such coaches are now used. Besides Chicago, they indeed include the East Coast -- in Boston and Miami.</p>
