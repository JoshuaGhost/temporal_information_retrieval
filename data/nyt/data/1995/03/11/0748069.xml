        <p>In a serious setback to the already battered Morrison Knudsen Corporation, the Bay Area Rapid Transit district in San Francisco announced today that it had awarded a $330 million contract, its largest ever, to AEG Transportation Systems Inc. to refurbish its aging fleet of 439 rail cars.</p>
        <p>The contract represents a boon to AEG Transportation, which is owned by a German conglomerate, the AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie group, and is refurbishing rail cars for the first time.</p>

        <p>In a serious setback to the already battered Morrison Knudsen Corporation, the Bay Area Rapid Transit district in San Francisco announced today that it had awarded a $330 million contract, its largest ever, to AEG Transportation Systems Inc. to refurbish its aging fleet of 439 rail cars.</p>
        <p>The contract represents a boon to AEG Transportation, which is owned by a German conglomerate, the AEG Daimler-Benz Industrie group, and is refurbishing rail cars for the first time.</p>
        <p>The only rival bidder was MK Transit, a unit of Morrison Knudsen of Boise, Idaho. The transit unit is reeling after having lost more than $100 million last year, much of that from problems with its rail-car manufacturing business.</p>
        <p>Morrison Knudsen is also in the midst of a major restructuring after the forced resignation recently of its chief executive, William J. Agee, who was accused of having mismanaged the company and leaving it with serious financial problems.</p>
        <p>AEG Transportation's $330 million bid was lowered sharply from its preliminary bid 15 months ago of $571 million after a long series of negotiations.</p>
        <p>Morrison Knudsen's bid was $469 million, down from a preliminary bid of $547 million.</p>
        <p>"You don't want to show your hand in the first round," said Peter Stetler, a vice president at AEG Transportation. "We knew there was another bid coming so we came in high the first time."</p>
        <p>MK Transit is manufacturing 80 new rail cars for BART, as the San Francisco mass transit body is known, but recently lost an opportunity to manufacture up to 170 more when BART decided not to exercise an option for further purchases.</p>
        <p>The company said that a plant it had established near San Francisco to produce those cars was now at risk of closing because of the loss of the contract today for refurbishing the old cars.</p>
        <p>"There has been no final decision on the plant, but the market now does not look promising," said Mark Armstrong, a Morrison Knudsen spokesman.</p>
        <p>"This raises the problem I've been worried about for a while, whether they are in this business for the long term," said Tobias M. Levkovich, an analyst at Smith Barney. "The question is whether they are going to keep their customer base."</p>
        <p>Ironically, MK Transit, which in the past has been criticized for underbidding its jobs, and then suffering as costs rose, bid more than $100 million higher than AEG Transportation.</p>
        <p>The project, which is expected to take seven years to complete, involves the initial refurbishment of 200 cars for $177.3 million. The remaining cars are expected to be refurbished later as BART exercises a series of options.</p>
        <p>The refurbishment amounts to the remanufacture of the rail cars. They will be stripped down, with most of the electrical components, engines, brakes and wiring to be replaced. The chassis and shell will remain. BART's distinctive brown and orange color patterns will be replaced with blue-gray seats and carpets.</p>
        <p>AEG Transportation was formerly the transportation business of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation. It combined its business with AEG about seven years ago in a joint venture. AEG then acquired Westinghouse's interest a couple of years ago, leaving the division wholly owned by the German industrial giant.  COMPANY NEWS</p>
