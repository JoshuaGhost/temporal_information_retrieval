        <p>The head of the National Police Agency was shot outside his home this morning, and the police said that he was seriously injured but that his life was not in danger.</p>
        <p>A man wearing a white face mask fired about four shots at Takaji Kunimatsu, Japan's top law-enforcement official, as Mr. Kunimatsu was about to step into his chauffeured car to go to work at 8:30 A.M. The man then fled on a bicycle and escaped, television reports said.</p>
        <p>"This is do-or-die resistance against the government power," Hiromu Nonaka, Minister of Home Affairs, told reporters. "We will thoroughly investigate with all our forces."</p>
        <p>Shootings are rare in Japan, except when gangsters get in fights with each other. But the police appeared to believe that other attacks could be imminent, for within a few hours other police on the streets were wearing bullet-proof vests.</p>
        <p>An attack on a senior official is particularly rare, and television stations immediately broke into regular programming to broadcast scattered and conflicting reports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kunimatsu has been active recently in cracking down on gangsters who extort money from companies, and also in investigating the nerve gas attack last week on Tokyo's subway system. Some experts now believe that the subway attack was also aimed at the police.</p>
        <p>All five trains hit by the nerve gas were scheduled to arrive within a few minutes of each other at Kasumigaseki subway station, where the police agency and other Government offices are located. The particular subway cars where gas was released were reportedly those that would be closest to the subway exit used by people going to the police agency.</p>
        <p>In addition, the five trains were scheduled to arrive at Kasumigaseki between 8 A.M. and 8:30 A.M., just the time when an attack would be most effective against the police. Although other Government offices frequently begin their day at 9 A.M., the police begin at 8:30.</p>
        <p>Suspicion for the subway attack has increasingly focused on a religious sect called Aum Shinrikyo. But Aum denies any role, and there is no evidence linking Aum to the shooting of Mr. Kunimatsu.</p>
        <p>Asked if there was a connection between this morning's shooting and Aum Shinrikyo, Mr. Nonaka, the Minister of Home Affairs, said: "I don't know."</p>
        <p>Kyodo News Agency said that the gunman fired four shots from behind an electric utility pole, and that Mr. Kunimatsu was hit in the stomach, chest and leg. Television Tokyo reported that two bullets of about .38 caliber had been removed during surgery at a local hospital.</p>
        <p>There were other conflicting reports, however, suggesting that a shotgun may have been used in the attack.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kunimatsu is equivalent in some ways to the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States, but he has authority over local police agencies as well as the national police.</p>
        <p>The police have been pressing their investigation of Aum Shinrikyo over the last few days by searching a building that the sect says is its holiest structure. The police say that a hidden entrance leads to what is virtually a chemical factory. But the police apparently have not found any clear evidence linking Aum to the subway attack.</p>
