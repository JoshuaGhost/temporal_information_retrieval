        <p>THE TERM WORLD MUSIC invariably conjures up images of exotic locales in the Middle East or the Caribbean, foreign languages like Swahili or Balinese and unusual instruments like pan pipes or steel drums.

Or the solid growth of Green Linnet Records, the Connecticut independent label that has over the last decade evolved from a sanctuary into a mission house for traditional Irish music.

        <p>THE TERM WORLD MUSIC invariably conjures up images of exotic locales in the Middle East or the Caribbean, foreign languages like Swahili or Balinese and unusual instruments like pan pipes or steel drums. Yet perhaps the most flourishing world music at the moment is rooted in Western civilization's own backyard, sung primarily in English and played mainly on familiar instruments.</p>
        <p>It is Celtic music, the centuries-old music of Ireland and Scotland, and its growing popularity can be seen in the commercial success of artists ranging from the Chieftains, longtime keepers of the flame of traditional Irish music, to the mystical, Gaelic sounds of the New Age diva Enya Ni Bhraonain. Or the solid growth of Green Linnet Records, the Connecticut independent label that has over the last decade evolved from a sanctuary into a mission house for traditional Irish music.  And now, just in time for St. Patrick's Day on Friday, Atlantic Records is inaugurating Celtic Heartbeat, a label devoted exclusively to the music of Ireland.</p>
        <p>The influence of Celtic music is also being felt in current pop and rock music. In recent years, Irish- and British-based performers like U2, Sinead O'Connor and Kate Bush, as well as American groups like Black 47, have incorporated elements of traditional Celtic music into their own work.</p>
        <p>"We are most definitely in a renaissance period," says Mick Moloney, a musician who teaches Irish folklore at Villanova University in suburban Philadelphia. "I think, especially in the United States, people are attracted to it not only because it is quite compelling and passionate music but also because it is tied to a living, breathing tradition -- one which continues to have a vital function in the culture of both native Irish people and Irish-Americans. It's become our greatest national resource."</p>
        <p>It is the proud guarding of that resource that has helped distinguish Celtic music from other forms of world music. This is especially true in the United States. At clubs like the Blarney Star in Manhattan and the Abbey Pub in Chicago, as well as at annual festivals held in many American cities, dedicated musicians and listeners work together to preserve the essential character of traditional Celtic music and, with it, their heritage and identity.</p>
        <p>To appreciate that tradition, one need only attend a festival like the two-day extravaganza held each year under the sponsorship of Green Linnet. Last October, more than 1,000 people -- nearly twice as many as the previous year -- gathered for the festival at Kutsher's Country Club in Monticello, N.Y. Some 70 traditional musicians and dancers from Ireland, Scotland, England, Canada and the United States performed.</p>
        <p>Spread throughout the resort's sprawling grounds, there were simultaneously concerts, workshops, traditional "ceili" dancing and informal "sessions," where professionals and amateurs, on fiddles, flutes and accordions, shared in the learning and playing of jigs, reels, hornpipes and airs that often date back hundreds of years.</p>
        <p>What was most striking about the festival, though, beyond the brilliance of the music and the daunting exhibitions by both individual and group dancers, was the sense of community that binds together the diverse threads of Celtic music. As Earle Hitchner, a columnist for the newspaper The Irish Echo and an authority on traditional Celtic music in America, points out, "You really get the feeling that everyone involved in this music is part of one gigantic extended family." Alan O'Leary, a flute player from London, adds, "To those of us inside the music, it's almost tribal, especially in terms of the respect we have for the elders -- the musicians who kept it alive when it was hard to do."</p>
        <p>One such elder is Jack Coen, a 70-year-old wooden flute player from the Bronx who received a Heritage Award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1991 for his work as a player and teacher of traditional Irish music. Hundreds of the melodies he plays he brought with him from Ireland in 1949. ("I never learned them," he says. "I just knew them.") He likens playing the music to "an affliction -- a bug." But, he adds: "You have to want to get bit. The people I got it from, I went after them, and if I didn't get it from them, I wouldn't have it to pass on now."</p>
        <p>Among those to whom Mr. Coen has passed along the melodies is Joanie Madden, a first-generation Irish-American flutist who is the leader of the all-female traditional group Cherish the Ladies. (She is also the daughter of the accordionist Joe Madden.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Madden is part of a significant development within Celtic music -- the emergence of many female musicians. In addition to Ms. Madden, there is Liz Carroll of Chicago, who, in 1975, at age 18, won the prestigious All-Ireland senior fiddling competition and is now viewed as the finest American-born traditional fiddler. Following in her footsteps is Eileen Ivers of New York, another former All-Ireland fiddle competition winner. In recent years Ms. Ivers has branched out to play with the soul rockers Hall and Oates as well as with her own fusion group, the Ivers-Egan Band.</p>
        <p>For longtime Celtic music fans, perhaps the most remarkable evidence of the genre's resurgence has been the rediscovery of the legendary button accordionist Joe Derrane. A native of Boston, Mr. Derrane gained a worldwide reputation in the late 1940's when, as a teen-ager, he made a series of recordings featuring a breakneck-paced, stutter-stepping style, previously unheard in traditional accordion music.</p>
        <p>In the late 1950's, Mr. Derrane faced a difficult choice. "I was told I could get much more work, playing different kinds of music, if I switched to a piano accordion," he recalls. The techniques for the two instruments are very difficult, and, to make the transition, he had to abandon the button accordion. "If you don't play an accordion, it deteriorates," he says. "And rather than see it get ruined through lack of use, I sold it."</p>
        <p>Mr. Derrane, who had retired from performing, never thought he would return to the "button box" until a reissue of his classic recordings in 1993 prompted Mr. Hitchner, the journalist, to track him down for an interview. As it happened, a friend had also recently given Mr. Derrane a vintage button accordion as a present, and he was once again bitten by the bug.</p>
        <p>LAST SUMMER, BEFORE A crowd of 15,000 at the Wolf Trap Irish Music Festival in Vienna, Va., Mr. Derrane made his first public appearance on the button accordion in 35 years. His playing so electrified the audience that when he finished, to a standing ovation, he had to vow publicly never again to stop playing the instrument. This month, Mr. Derrane, 65, released his debut album, "Give Us Another," on Green Linnet.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen how greater mass awareness and commercial interest will affect traditional Celtic music. Insiders seem unconcerned about the danger of its spirit being co-opted. "If you have a strong core foundation, you can do anything with a tradition, because it's not endangered," says Mr. Moloney, the folklorist. The Scottish fiddler Johnny Cunningham recognizes the music's current market value. "Oh, yes, everyone's making their Celtic album now, and I can see why," he says. "Anyone can take hold of the music; it's very primal in nature." But, he cautions, it's much more likely that the music will affect those drawn to it rather than the other way around. "Any of us who play Celtic music can tell you: Once you play this music, it's part of your life. It's what you are."</p>
