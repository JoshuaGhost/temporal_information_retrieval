        <p>When the Rangers visit President Clinton in the White House Rose Garden this afternoon, they will present him with a miniature Stanley Cup that bears the inscription: "From One Madison Square Garden Victor to Another."</p>
        <p>The reference is to the Rangers' championship of last June and to Clinton's nomination at the Democratic National Convention in New York in 1992.</p>
        <p>Without putting too fine a point on the comparison, it is fair to observe that both of those triumphs occurred "then" and that the situations are different "now," including the Rangers' two-game losing streak, their first of this length since they lost three straight in January.</p>
        <p>"If you live in the past, you're not going to last long," said Mark Messier, the Ranger captain, who scored a short-handed goal and won a one-sided fight with Kevin Haller Wednesday night in a 4-3 loss to Philadelphia at the Garden.</p>
        <p>Messier was speaking, of course, of hockey, not politics; he hasn't visited the White House since 1982, when Ronald Reagan greeted participants in the National Hockey League All-Star Game.</p>
        <p>"When it's a big game and you don't win it, you always have to look at yourselves and answer some questions," Messier said, referring to the loss to the Flyers.</p>
        <p>One of the questions has to be about why the team plays so poorly in the first period of most games. Wednesday's was the worst, as the Flyers jumped to a 3-0 lead before the Rangers took a single shot on goal. Through the first 27 games this season, the Rangers have been outscored in the first period by 26-17. In the second period, they have outscored their opponents by 35-20. In the third period, they hold a slim edge of 25-24.</p>
        <p>Another question concerns the power play, which went 0 for 6 Wednesday night and is 2 for 26 over the last five games. One answer for this struggle is the absence of Sergei Zubov, the attacking defenseman who works the right point when the Rangers have an extra man.</p>
        <p>Zubov, who had a bone chip surgically removed from his left wrist on Feb. 27, won't play in the team's next game, Saturday night against the Capitals at Landover, Md. But Coach Colin Campbell said he hoped Zubov would return for the one after that, Wednesday at home against the Devils.</p>
