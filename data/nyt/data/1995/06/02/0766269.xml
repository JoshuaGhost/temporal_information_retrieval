        <p>The two men came all the way from Germany, where they were known for their graffiti talents. Their latest canvas, the police said, was the Bronx, which is  a mecca for the world's spray-painting cognoscenti.</p>
        <p>But instead of spending Wednesday night in a comfortable Manhattan hotel as other European tourists do, they spent it in a Bronx jail cell. Police officials said they had been caught in the act by officers, who had little appreciation for their artistic skills.</p>
        <p>Miroslav Milasinovic and Mirko Reisser, who live in Hamburg, were caught painting an elephant on a handball court wall outside Elementary School 107 in the West Farms section of the Bronx near the Bruckner Expressway, the police said. A police spokesman, Sgt. Edward Orski, said the police had confiscated more than a hundred cans of paint.</p>
        <p>"The two men from Germany are world-renowned graffiti artists," the sergeant  said, adding that the two had been hired by a New York graffiti painter, Alfred  Oyague of 1145 Nobel Avenue in the Bronx, who had been arrested along with them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oyague said from jail that he had painted the wall for years but that things had changed after Rudolph W. Giuliani became Mayor.</p>
        <p>"How am I supposed to know they changed the rules?" he said. "I don't have a  direct line to Giuliani's office."</p>
        <p>Mr. Oyague said that contrary to the police account, he had not paid for the  men to come to the Bronx, which is to graffiti painters what Vienna is to music  lovers.</p>
        <p>"We hooked up with them through the editor of a magazine," he said. "They had planned to come to just visit New York. I don't think painting was in the picture. I invited them to come to my place and to do the work on the mural with me."</p>
        <p>Mr. Oyague's sister, Karen, said that the two men were "really good at drawing characters," and that they always whitewashed walls before sketching out their subject matter and painting it. "They came down about two weeks ago and are staying with my brother," she added.</p>
        <p>But Sergeant Orski said the only recognition the city was giving the three for their work was charges of criminal mischief.</p>
