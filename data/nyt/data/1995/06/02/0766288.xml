        <p>After months of discussions, the House has set July 12 for the beginning of extensive hearings on the 1993 Federal assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Tex.</p>
        <p>The hearings, to be held jointly by subcommittees of the Judiciary Committee  and the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, were planned long before the bombing in Oklahoma City. But the explosion resurrected long-simmering questions about the way the Federal Government had planned and executed various  parts of the raid on the Branch Davidian compound, adding urgency to the push for hearings.</p>
        <p>Representative Bill McCollum, the Florida Republican who is chairman of the  Judiciary subcommittee on crime, said on Wednesday that the hearings would last  at least a week and would include sworn testimony.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCollum said that the subcommittees would have subpoena power and that counsel for the subcommittees might conduct the initial interrogation of some witnesses, giving the hearings the aura of a trial.</p>
        <p>"It's not a trial," Mr. McCollum said, "but it is a major investigation. We need to get all the facts on the table and to allow the public to see what happened. The second purpose is to assess blame and determine the lessons to be  learned."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCollum said he expected Attorney General Janet Reno and Director Louis  J. Freeh of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to testify voluntarily.</p>
        <p>In February 1993, Federal agents tried to enter the Branch Davidian compound  to arrest the group's leader, David Koresh, on suspicion of violating firearms laws. After four agents and five Branch Davidians were killed, Federal agents and those inside the compound engaged in an armed standoff that lasted 51 days.  The impasse ended on April 19, when Federal agents under the direction of the F.B.I. drove armored vehicles up to the compound and fired tear gas inside. A fire erupted in the compound, killing more than 80 of those inside. The Government said at the time that the fire had been set by the Branch Davidians.</p>
        <p>In the two years since the fire, "Waco" has become a rallying cry of right-wing paramilitary groups and other disaffected citizens who say the raid epitomizes what they describe as a Federal Government that has trampled on the rights of individuals and turned on its own people.</p>
        <p>The bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City, in which 167 people were killed, appears to have been timed to coincide with the second anniversary  of the Branch Davidian conflagration, leading to suggestions of a link between the two.</p>
        <p>The ranking Democrat on the crime subcommittee, Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, said on Wednesday that he saw "nothing wrong" with hearings on the Texas raid but that their scope made them "disproportionate" when no hearings have been scheduled to investigate the right-wing paramilitary groups.  Associates of Timothy J. McVeigh, the prime suspect in the Oklahoma bombing, have said Mr. McVeigh shares many of the views of those groups.</p>
        <p>"This is really misplaced priority," Mr. Schumer said. "If you ask the American people what's the greater threat -- these right-wing paramilitary organizations or the A.T.F. and F.B.I.? -- the vast majority would say the militias."</p>
        <p>Mr. McCollum brushed off the idea of comparable hearings. "We may hold a hearing or two on the subject" of paramilitary groups, he said, "or maybe we'll  see if the F.B.I. wants to give us a rundown on them. But we won't bring in 15 militia heads and talk to them."</p>
