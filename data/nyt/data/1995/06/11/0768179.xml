        <p>AT THIS WRITING, I HAVE survived six American Ballet Theater performances of "Giselle," four of "La Bayadere" and two of "Romeo and Juliet." Unlike the paying public, which, as ticket sales prove, prefers such evening-long story ballets, I think there is something to be said for mixed bills. Few in the audience, for instance, see the same three-hour work several days in a row. It is a tribute to Ballet Theater's dancers that these touchstones of classical dancing always looked fresh.</p>

        <p>AT THIS WRITING, I HAVE survived six American Ballet Theater performances of "Giselle," four of "La Bayadere" and two of "Romeo and Juliet." Unlike the paying public, which, as ticket sales prove, prefers such evening-long story ballets, I think there is something to be said for mixed bills. Few in the audience, for instance, see the same three-hour work several days in a row. It is a tribute to Ballet Theater's dancers that these touchstones of classical dancing always looked fresh.</p>
        <p>The company's season at the Metropolitan Opera House -- it still has a week remaining -- has been lively, surprising and rich. The programming has struck just the right artistic balance.</p>
        <p>There have been five premieres from three choreographers with a maverick bent, an unexpected flowering of male talent in the top ranks, and enough principal dancers to make repeated performances of full-length traditional works not only possible but tolerable and impressive. Few companies can put on that kind of show.</p>
        <p>The emphasis was on individual performers. The women, while often outstanding if not always versatile, were overshadowed by the men. A company that last year was short on male principals suddenly acquired gifted newcomers (especially Vladimir Malakhov and Angel Corella) and saw a stunning improvement in the ranks, notably from Jeremy Collins and Parrish Maynard.</p>
        <p>The season was just as striking for its decidedly mixed bag of premieres. As choreographers, Lar Lubovitch, James Kudelka and Twyla Tharp seemed to have little in common beyond an eagerness to fill a large stage: they proved, at least, that distinct voices in ballet choreography still exist.</p>
        <p>A creative spark was evident in each case, but it did not always ignite. Mr. Lubovitch, who was the most conventional, had the strongest impact with "A Brahms Symphony." Ms. Tharp and Mr. Kudelka lost their way to some degree, perhaps because they ventured along more experimental paths.</p>
        <p>In "States of Grace," Mr. Kudelka's world premiere to Hindemith's 1934 Mathis der Maler Symphony, the choreographer is palpably concerned with new approaches to content and form. On the technical side, he continues to explore ballet partnering, going beyond the thrilling throws and tosses that are his metaphors for passion. In "Cruel World," the superb work he created for Ballet Theater last year, the tone was set with a whirlpool of eruptive duets.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, Mr. Kudelka sees partnering as involving more than two dancers. In "Cruel World," a woman is dramatically lifted and supported by a group of men. In "States of Grace," the emphasis is on trios, although the effect often suggests an assisted duet -- one man helping another man maneuver a woman, or a woman maneuvering both men, until all three are swallowed up by ensembles that invade the stage.</p>
        <p>Invade may be the operative word. To my mind, if no one else's, "States of Grace" is an antiwar ballet. Its weakness is that few people can agree about its meaning; Mr. Kudelka is too preoccupied with getting his dancers in and out of ingenious entanglements to make his larger theme clear.</p>
        <p>The three movements of Hindemith's symphony are drawn from the composer's opera of the same name, which was inspired by the life of the 16th-century German painter Mattias (Mathis) Grunewald. Mr. Kudelka's choreography in general is never purely formal, and it is tempting to relate his final dramatic image here to the opera behind the symphony. In Hindemith's libretto, Grunewald joins the underclass in the German Peasant Revolt of 1524 until the horrors of war drive him back to his art. At the end of "States of Grace," three women who have been surrounded by 11 men come to the fore. Behind them Jennifer Tipton's lighting darkens to a horizon line toward which the men roll. The stage suggests a battlefield littered with bodies.</p>
        <p>Like most of the men in this work, the women on toe wear stylized hints of medieval chain mail and are clearly caught up in the turmoil that spews from the music. Susan Jaffe may symbolize the dutiful regal wife; Charles Askegard and Robert Hill, who often lie at her feet, pass her around in a chivalric manner. Amanda McKerrow is a Joan of Arc, a female warrior who is lifted by the men but also canters along with them, always on the attack. Julie Kent, who enters in the symphony's second, quiet movement, is more of a Mother Courage. Like Ms. Jaffe, she has two men at her feet, Ethan Brown and Christopher Martin, but she often pulls them along the floor.</p>
        <p>It would be fitting to see these women as the embodiment of a spiritual ideal. They resemble allegorical figures rather than real people involved in specific relationships. But "States of Grace" also looks like a study in the sort of movement experiments that fascinate Mr. Kudelka. The mechanics of the partnering are almost too inventive in themselves. Nonetheless, with all the slithering men and women held aloft, there is an unusual mix of the terrestrial and the aerial. The dancers in Ms. Kent's trio imaginatively twist their bodies into virtually braided shapes.</p>
        <p>Form may not generate content in "States of Grace," as Mr. Kudelka intended, but his formal devices are interesting. The various units of dancers are not restricted to neatly defined segments but often interact with others. Spatially, Mr. Kudelka likes to play with diagonals, and he combines swift classical footwork with a free use of the arms. Movement always expresses emotion for Mr. Kudelka. But in "States of Grace" he is still working things out.</p>
        <p>Content was also open to interpretation in two of the three ballets that Ms. Tharp presented at a Ballet Theater gala. The exception was "Jump Start," in which the dancing, set to Wynton Marsalis's jazz-inspired score, could be taken at face value. The 10-part suite recalls Ms. Tharp's "Nine Sinatra Songs" in its gloss on social dances but takes a more stylized view of its material, including a Latin number and a jitterbug. A bluesy duet is turned into a beach romance. If cut and performed to tape, "Jump Start" could have a useful shelf life at Ballet Theater. It has Ms. Tharp's typical verve.</p>
        <p>THE SUBTEXT IN "AMERICANS We," another Tharp premiere, is up for grabs. The title, which comes from a march by Henry Fillmore (whose bandmaster music, with Stephen Foster songs, makes up the score), fits the ballet's cliched Americana images. Why these overlap with a separate cluster of dancers in classical tutus and tights is a mystery.</p>
        <p>As has been true in the past, Ms. Tharp is at her best in formal choreography, not when she is trying to impose a message upon that choreography. "How Near Heaven," the third Tharp piece, may have a subliminal theme about duality flowing into an ideal whole. But, for all its occasional flaws, "How Near Heaven" succeeds because the enigmatic subtext does not interfere with the energy and design of the movement.</p>
        <p>The ballet's pseudo-mystical underpinnings, at odds with the theatricality of its Britten score (Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge), may be abstract, but the action on stage is visually concrete. There are two ballerinas, backed up by a couple, an ensemble and, best of all, a male quartet in which Ms. Tharp channels raw power into controlled ballet bravura. There is richness of detail in the choreography; Ms. Tharp needs only to learn how to make it visible in a large house like the Met.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lubovitch's "Brahms Symphony" has an easier time filling the Met stage. Once called a third-stream choreographer, he knows how to fuse ballet technique with modern-dance dynamics (in this case, derived from Doris Humphrey). Ballet Theater invited him to add a fourth section to the three movements he choreographed in 1985 to Brahms's Third Symphony for his own modern-dance troupe. This expanded version has magnificently suited the passion and sweep of Ballet Theater's dramatically inclined dancers.</p>
        <p>There may have been an exciting strangeness about Ms. Tharp's "How Near Heaven," but Mr. Lubovitch triumphed through perfection of form. One would hate to choose between the two, and one didn't need to. That was the beauty of Ballet Theater's season.  DANCE VIEW</p>
