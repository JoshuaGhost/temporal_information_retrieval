        <p>Reports of blue-ribbon commissions often fade into obscurity as soon as they are issued. But the recommendations of a Federal panel advising Congress on immigration policy are already getting serious attention on Capitol Hill, and that only promises to increase as next year's Presidential campaign heats up.</p>
        <p>The panel, headed by former Representative Barbara Jordan of Texas, suggested last week that Congress gradually reduce legal immigration by one-third, to an annual level of 550,000. It also suggested speeding up the admission of spouses and young children of legal aliens.</p>
        <p>Hispanic, Asian-American, Roman Catholic and Jewish groups harshly criticized the commission's recommendations, which include a proposal to cut refugee admissions by more than 50 percent, to 50,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, President Clinton endorsed the recommendations within a few hours of meeting with Ms. Jordan. This surprised immigration officials and some White House aides, who had urged a more cautious approach.</p>
        <p>Immigration seems likely to be an issue in next year's Presidential election. Gov. Pete Wilson of California, who is likely to seek the Republican Presidential nomination, has repeatedly expressed concern about illegal immigration, and many Republicans in Congress are trying to cut off welfare benefits for legal aliens.</p>
        <p>Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic group, said the commission had "jumped on a political bandwagon" to restrict immigration. ROBERT PEAR</p>
