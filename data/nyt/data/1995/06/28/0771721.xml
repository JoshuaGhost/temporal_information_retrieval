        <p>Dr. Leonard Jeffries, whose long and tumultuous chairmanship of City College's Black Studies Department will end this week, said today that he would press his three-year legal battle against the college to the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>The day after the City University of New York's Board of Trustees approved the department's choice of his successor, Dr. Jeffries, in a seemingly relaxed and talkative frame of mind outside his home here, explained his decision not to seek renewal of his three-year appointment as chairman.</p>
        <p>He did not want, he said, to be bogged down in "paper pushing," as he devotes himself fully to challenging an April ruling that upheld the college's rights to strip him of his chairmanship for making anti-Semitic and racist remarks.</p>
        <p>"It is because the case is so important," he said. "It addresses fundamental issues of academic freedom, and the constitutional rights of black people are at stake."</p>
        <p>The legal struggle began shortly after 1991, when Dr. Jeffries first gained wide attention for delivering a speech in Albany in which he said Jews were responsible for a Hollywood conspiracy to disparage blacks in movies and had played a major role in the slave trade. City College removed him as chairman in 1992, but in 1993, a Federal court jury in Manhattan found that the school had violated his right to free speech. Dr. Jeffries was reinstated as department head after a Federal appeals court upheld the verdict in 1994.</p>
        <p>But in April, the Federal appeals court reversed its 1994 decision, basing its ruling on a Supreme Court case that made it easier for government agencies to penalize employees for their statements.</p>
        <p>Outside his blue, split-level house, Dr. Jeffries was upbeat, even though his 20-plus-year chairmanship of the department was in its final days, and even though car trouble had interrupted his plans to go to Queens.</p>
        <p>Inside his 1987 Lincoln Town Car, the professor sat with his foot on the gas pedal trying to get the engine running normally. Dressed casually, in black plants and a black shirt, the kufi on his head gave the only hint of the traditional African clothes Dr. Jeffries usually favors in public. Neighbors meandered by on the block where the professor and his family have lived for 10 years in the historically black northeast section of Teaneck.</p>
        <p>The local celebrity chatted easily with his passing neighbors about the strong winds that had scattered tree branches on sidewalks, and about the winds of change in his life.</p>
        <p>Clearly at peace, the professor spoke favorably of his successor, Moyibi J. Amoda -- a sharp contrast to the usual television snapshots of him at full oratorical flight. Dr. Jeffries's face showed irritation only when he spoke of those who had interpreted the change in chairmen as a personal loss of power.</p>
        <p>"Jeffries is not out. Jeffries is in," he told a neighbor through the car window. "I'm still in the department. I'm not going anywhere. I'm on the executive committee. Professor Amoda has been on the faculty for 20 years. He's our candidate. He's not their candidate."</p>
        <p>Dr. Yolanda T. Moses, the president of City College, declined to discuss the legal case.</p>
        <p>Joseph Fleming, Dr. Jeffries's lawyer, said they would file a petition to the Supreme Court by Monday. It was three months ago that the Federal Appeals Court ruled that City College was acting within its rights in demoting the professor, based on an interpretation of the 1994 United States Supreme Court case Waters v. Churchill.</p>
        <p>In addition to contesting the Waters case, Mr. Fleming said they would argue that the professor was not acting in his capacity as chairman, or a public employee, when he gave the Albany speech.</p>
        <p>Sidestepping the question of whether he would like to eventually regain the department's chairmanship, Dr. Jeffries said he expected the legal case to help him acquire a wider audience.</p>
        <p>'I've moved beyond the chairmanship," he said. "I'm chairman of those whose constitutional rights -- black, Asian, Latinos -- are threatened. I have a chairmanship that is not limited to City College."  And indeed, he showed that the mere loss of an administrative post would hardly extinguish his drive to expound on his views. After starting his car and giving a visitor a tour of the area, he opened the trunk, revealing a traveling library of photocopied articles and speeches. He handed the visitor five pounds worth.</p>
        <p>His successor, Dr. Amoda, is a Nigerian-born political scientist. On the day of Dr. Amoda's appointment, some college officials described him as a cautious person who had navigated his department's political waters for more than two decades by remaining steadfastly neutral. Dr. Amoda, who was traveling in Africa, could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>When the college demoted Dr. Jeffries in 1992 and replaced him briefly with Dr. Edmund W. Gordon, causing paralysis in the department, Dr. Amoda said: "It's not fair to Dr. Gordon and it's not fair to us. The system is playing politics with people who just want to do their jobs."</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Moses said today that the college did not pressure the department members to choose a new chairman, she was clearly pleased with their choice of someone not identified as a Jeffries loyalist.</p>
        <p>"It is my hope that the department can now become an active member of the university community -- not just a department on the periphery but with ties to other departments," she said.</p>
