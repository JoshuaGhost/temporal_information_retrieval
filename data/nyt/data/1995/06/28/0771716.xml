        <p>With Europe's economies struggling with high unemployment and swollen budget deficits, European Union leaders meeting here have put off plans for a common currency from 1997 to Jan. 1, 1999, at the earliest.</p>
        <p>Even then, they said on Tuesday, probably only Germany, France, and smaller countries in their economic orbit would be ready to join.</p>

        <p>With Europe's economies struggling with high unemployment and swollen budget deficits, European Union leaders meeting here have put off plans for a common currency from 1997 to Jan. 1, 1999, at the earliest.</p>
        <p>Even then, they said on Tuesday, probably only Germany, France, and smaller countries in their economic orbit would be ready to join.</p>
        <p>European leaders agreed to back a French and British decision to send a rapid reaction force to Bosnia to help protect United Nations peacekeepers there, and dispatched their negotiator, Carl Bildt, to seek a diplomatic settlement.</p>
        <p>National domestic politics set most of the agenda for the deliberations at the meeting.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister John Major of Britain spent most of the last two days tracking a challenge to his position as leader of the Conservative Party. His opponents at home accused him of secretly wanting to dissolve the pound into a new European currency.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Major said today, "I am very dubious indeed about the prospects of monetary union in 1999. There is no chance whatsoever that all 15 will be able and willing."</p>
