        <p>Beginning a week of celebrations that will culminate on Sunday in a march down Fifth Avenue, hundreds of gay and lesbian New Yorkers filled Union Square Park yesterday for what was billed as a rally but looked more like an enormous summertime family picnic.</p>
        <p>One family stepped on stage to make a point about Father's Day. "Being heterosexual doesn't make you a good parent," said Doug Robinson, who was joined by his partner, Michael Elsasser, and their adopted sons, Justin and Zachary. "A good parent is someone who is willing to go the distance with their child."</p>

        <p>Beginning a week of celebrations that will culminate on Sunday in a march down Fifth Avenue, hundreds of gay and lesbian New Yorkers filled Union Square Park yesterday for what was billed as a rally but looked more like an enormous summertime family picnic.</p>
        <p>One family stepped on stage to make a point about Father's Day. "Being heterosexual doesn't make you a good parent," said Doug Robinson, who was joined by his partner, Michael Elsasser, and their adopted sons, Justin and Zachary. "A good parent is someone who is willing to go the distance with their child."</p>
        <p>For good measure, Zachary, 6, added, "Love makes a family."</p>
        <p>Speakers, singers and comedians took turns on the stage, framed by rainbow-colored balloons, symboliing the gay civil rights movement. High above the crowd, a rainbow-striped banner flew from the Independence Flagstaff monument in the center of the park.</p>
        <p>The most sobering note was sounded by Dennis deLeon, president of the Latino Commission on AIDS, who said that while cases of AIDS had declined among gay white men over the last five years, they had increased 79 percent among gay black men and 61 percent among gay Hispanic men.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest cheers went up for Karen S. Burstein, who ran unsuccessfully last year for State Attorney General. She is to be one of the grand marshals of the Pride March, along with the Olympic diver Greg Louganis and the Rev. Zachary G. Jones, pastor of the Unity Fellowship Christ Church in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The president of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, William A. Donohue, called on city officials yesterday to move the parade away from St. Patrick's Cathedral. But an aide to Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, Marty Algaze, said that the permit had already been issued and the route would not change.</p>
        <p>Before the march steps off on Sunday, there will be dozens of parties, performances, movie screenings, readings, speeches and shows.</p>
        <p>On Saturday there will be another parade, this one sponsored by the Lesbian Avengers. Marchers will gather at Bryant Park in midtown, and they plan to walk down Fifth Avenue to Washington Square Park.</p>
        <p>"It's a solidarity march, because lesbians are mostly overlooked in a gay event," Kim Barget, one of the organizers, said. The organizers are asking that only women participate in the Saturday night march. Men will be asked to remain on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>No permit is being sought for the event, which may draw 5,000 participants. "We don't do legal demonstrations," Ms. Barget said. "We do civil disobedience."</p>
        <p>Tonight, during the annual garden party at the Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, 208 West 13th Street, a $3.5 million capital campaign will be announced.</p>
        <p>"This is a haven for gay and lesbian people who have been battered, beaten down and discouraged in the face of discrimination and AIDS," said Richard D. Burns, executive director of the center, which serves as a kind of social and political Grand Central Terminal for gay men and lesbians.</p>
        <p>The chief goal of the renovation, Mr. Burns said, is to make more of the 151-year-old former public schoolhouse accessible to disabled visitors. That means a new elevator, wheelchair lifts and bathrooms. A two-story entrance hall will also be created. New fire stairs, sprinklers, wiring, plumbing and heating are also planned.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the week, the calendar is full. An event is scheduled for every night at A Different Light, a bookstore at 151 West 19th Street that specializes in publications concerning gay and lesbian issues. The Hetrick-Martin Institute, a social services agency for youth, is holding a benefit tomorrow. Congregation Beth Simchat Torah, the gay and lesbian synagogue at 57 Bethune Street, has invited Roberta Achtenberg, a mayoral candidate in San Francisco, to address its Friday night service. The next morning, the Front Runners club is to hold a five-mile race through Central Park.</p>
        <p>At City Hall tomorrow, Public Advocate Mark Green will honor six gay and lesbian leaders. At Carnegie Hall on Thursday, the 150-member New York City Gay Men's Chorus is to perform.</p>
        <p>Competing with the chorus will be Governor William F. Weld of Massachusetts, who is to give the keynote speech to a benefit dinner that night for the Human Rights Campaign Fund, the nation's largest gay political organization, in a tent pitched across 62d Street from Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>Explaining the choice of a Republican speaker, Fred P. Hochberg, co-chairman of the benefit, said: "This is a Republican governor who's been very strong and good on gay issues, who's made a concerted effort to help gay youth. I wanted to put some pressure on this state. We're lagging behind other states with Republican chief executives."</p>
