        <p>HE could hear the cheers behind him, but he knew they weren't for him. Greg Norman was waiting to putt on the 16th green when the cheers rolled across the Shinnecock Hills shadows for Corey Pavin's 4-wood to the 18th green that would win the United States Open.</p>

        <p>HE could hear the cheers behind him, but he knew they weren't for him. Greg Norman was waiting to putt on the 16th green when the cheers rolled across the Shinnecock Hills shadows for Corey Pavin's 4-wood to the 18th green that would win the United States Open.</p>
        <p>Pavin hurried down the fairway and thrust both arms to the sky. His gallery roared. Those in Norman's gallery bit their lips. Again.</p>
        <p>"I knew what it was for," the 40-year-old Australian would say later. "They started chanting, 'Cor-ey! Cor-ey!' "</p>
        <p>Up near the century-old Stanford White clubhouse, he would smile when he shook hands with Pavin and said, "Congratulations and welcome to the club," meaning golf's exclusive club of major tournament winners. And now, his black straw hat off, he was being just as gracious.</p>
        <p>"Corey's one of the great shot makers," he said. "Most guys hit it basically one way, but he likes to fade it, he likes to hook it, he hits it high, he hits it low. He's a manipulator of the golf ball."</p>
        <p>But once again Greg Norman had not won a major he might have won. He won the 1986 and 1993 British Opens, but he has finished second or tied for second a total of six times. He has had six third-round leads in a major and won once. But he insisted that he doesn't look back.</p>
        <p>"It never haunts me," he said. "I can sit back and say I'm a lot better than a lot of other players. I don't feel sorry for myself. It's just as hard to get yourself in there with a chance to win as it is to win."</p>
        <p>If a James Bond movie needed a golfer, Greg Norman would get the part. Tall. Blond. Big shoulders. Trim waist. Long legs. Sturdy stride. And as an Aussie from the Barrier Reef, he has the perfect nickname: The Great White Shark.</p>
        <p>But for all his millions, for all of his grandeur in winning those two British Opens, for all of the other golf tournaments he has won on the PGA Tour and all over the world, when people think of Greg Norman, they think of the tournaments the Shark let get away or were snatched from him. Especially the majors. If golf is a cruel game, it has sometimes been excruciating for him.</p>
        <p>In the 1984 United States Open at Winged Foot, he rolled in a breaking 45-foot putt on the 18th green that would create an 18-hole playoff that Fuzzy Zoeller won. But people remembered the Shark's mistakes: a pushed 4-iron into the bleachers at the 18th green before salvaging a par, a double-bogey 6 out of the trees on the playoff's second hole where Zoeller sank a 50-foot birdie putt.</p>
        <p>In the 1986 Masters he pushed a 4-iron into the gallery at the 18th hole and finished a stroke behind 46-year-old Jack Nicklaus. In that year's United States Open at Shinnecock Hills he had the 54-hole lead but soared to a 75. After winning the British Open that year, he lost the P.G.A. Championship at Inverness outside Toledo, Ohio, when Bob Tway holed a bunker shot for a birdie at Inverness.</p>
        <p>In the 1987 Masters, he watched Larry Mize hole a 100-foot chip shot from off the 11th green for the birdie that won the green jacket on the second hole of their sudden-death playoff.</p>
        <p>In the 1989 British Open, he reached what Nicklaus described as "the unreachable bunker" with his drive and didn't finish a four-hole playoff that Mark Calcavecchia won.</p>
        <p>On the PGA Tour, he was on the 17th tee at the 1990 Nestle Invitational at Bay Hill when he heard a roar; Robert Gamez had holed a 7-iron from 186 yards for an eagle 2 to win. He lost the USF&amp;G Classic in New Orleans later that year when David Frost holed out from a bunker in front of the 18th green.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, with a black "0" next to his name on the leader boards, meaning he was even par and leading Pavin and Bob Tway by a stroke, he strode to the tee of the 472-yard 12th hole where the wind off the Atlantic, about a mile to the south, was at his back. His drive rolled down into the first cut of rough.</p>
        <p>With 175 yards to the green, he hit a 9-iron that ran off the back into heavy rough.</p>
        <p>"If I had one shot to play over, that would be the one," he said. "When the ball rolled into the heavy rough, I wasn't that far from the hole but I had no green to work with. If I had it to do over, I would hit the 9-iron a little lower so the wind wouldn't grab it."</p>
        <p>After that bogey at the 12th, his pulled tee shot into the rough at the 377-yard, dogleg-right 13th hole led to another bogey. Despite a birdie at the 415-yard 15th, those back-to-back bogies at the 12th and 13th, he acknowledged, "changed the momentum for me."</p>
        <p>And lost another major for him.</p>
        <p>That birdie at the 15th was his only birdie in his windblown rounds of 73 yesterday after 74 Saturday. But after finishing third in the Masters and second in the United States Open, the golf pro in the James Bond movie smiled when he was asked whether he was looking to next month's British Open at St. Andrews.</p>
        <p>"Three-two-one," he said. "That'd be a pretty good way to go."</p>
