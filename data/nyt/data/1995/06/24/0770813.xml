        <p>Each year, summer's arrival means the start of a cycle of national religious meetings. The faithful of one particular group or another meet in conventions, assemblies and synods to debate resolutions, elect officers and spend time with people of shared beliefs in a country that grows evermore religiously diverse.</p>
        <p>Over the last 10 days, for example, more than 200 Roman Catholic bishops met in Chicago, while 20,000 Southern Baptists met in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>From the style of their clerical garb to the language of their prayers, the bishops and the Baptists portrayed quite different points on Christianity's broad landscape. But it was possible to take a common lesson from their meetings: how a single individual can play a vital role in instilling a spirit of unity at such gatherings.</p>
        <p>In the case of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, that role has long been filled by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, the Archbishop of Chicago. But this year he was unable to attend, after undergoing surgery the same week as the bishops' conference to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas.</p>
        <p>At the Southern Baptist Convention this week the talk focused on the Rev. Billy Graham, who managed to preach despite suffering his own health problems, though less severe than the Cardinal's.</p>
        <p>In Cardinal Bernardin's absence, the bishops found themselves without a man who has been a center of intellectual gravity at past meetings. The 67-year-old prelate has long held the distinction of being a moderate trusted by both the dominant conservatives among the bishops and their diminishing liberal wing.</p>
        <p>Admirers ascribe to him characteristics like those of an effective Congressional committee chairman -- a zest for detail, an abundance of patience and an ability to find common ground on which people of differing opinions might stand.</p>
        <p>Using a powerful Chicago basketball metaphor to describe the Cardinal's absence, the Rev. Thomas Reese, a senior fellow at the Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University, said, "It really is like losing Michael Jordan from your team."</p>
        <p>The bishops themselves were more guarded in their assessments. The conference's president, William Cardinal Keeler, the Archbishop of Baltimore, said he believed that Cardinal Bernardin's prayers were helping move other bishops to take quiet positions of leadership.</p>
        <p>But Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee said he believed the Cardinal held a unique role. "Having the trust of everyone is important," he said.</p>
        <p>That would be particularly true given Archbishop Weakland's concern that the conference has changed over the last two or three years, with the bishops becoming less willing to take the bold stands they took in the 1980's with pastoral messages on world peace and the American economy.</p>
        <p>More and more prelates are not speaking out at all, the Archbishop said, adding, "Maybe the conference is typical of the whole nation." Differences among bishops "are greater," he said, and "there doesn't seem to be a clear vision."</p>
        <p>Mr. Graham, by contrast, has not played anything like the direct role among Southern Baptists that Cardinal Bernardin has among the bishops. The evangelist's appearances at Baptist meetings have been occasional; he has delivered inspiration rather than delving into committee work. And many perceive him as a sort of universal Christian clergyman, speaking to ecumenical gatherings around the world.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Graham is a Southern Baptist -- by choice, he points out, having been reared as a Presbyterian; he changed affiliation in college.</p>
        <p>His adopted denomination has suffered severe traumas in the last two decades, the result of a struggle between conservative and moderate factions that the conservatives won hands down. Some of those on the losing side have been forced from jobs on seminary faculties and in denominational agencies.</p>
        <p>And repercussions continue. The day before Mr. Graham appeared, officers of an alumni association at one Southern Baptist seminary resigned in protest over its new, conservative policies, among them what the officers said were narrow theological restrictions imposed by the administration.</p>
        <p>But Thursday morning, all eyes were on the 76-year old evangelist. Earlier this month, he was twice hospitalized in Toronto, where he had gone to preach one of his "crusades." Doctors diagnosed a bleeding colon and ordered several blood transfusions.</p>
        <p>Arriving at the Baptists' convention, which was held at the Georgia Dome, an indoor stadium, Mr. Graham walked more slowly than usual. And his sermon tended toward the conversational rather than the declamatory as he praised the denomination for its evangelistic efforts.</p>
        <p>He first spoke to the annual convention in 1951, Mr. Graham said. He had done so more than a dozen times since, and was now back on the denomination's 150th anniversary.</p>
        <p>"Think of it," he said: He had been around "long enough to have preached to one-third of the history of Southern Baptists."</p>
        <p>In all, he received four standing ovations.</p>
