        <p>The Supreme Court today repudiated the approach of its recent prisoners-rights cases and made it substantially more difficult for prisoners to bring constitutional lawsuits challenging prison management.</p>
        <p>Only actions by prison officials that impose "atypical and significant hardship on the inmate" should be treated by Federal judges as even potential violations of an inmate's constitutional right to due process of law, Chief Justice William H.

        <p>The Supreme Court today repudiated the approach of its recent prisoners-rights cases and made it substantially more difficult for prisoners to bring constitutional lawsuits challenging prison management.</p>
        <p>Only actions by prison officials that impose "atypical and significant hardship on the inmate" should be treated by Federal judges as even potential violations of an inmate's constitutional right to due process of law, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said in his 5-to-4 majority opinion.</p>
        <p>Prisoner complaints that fall short of that standard -- which could range from bungled disciplinary hearings to temporary placement in solitary confinement -- are generally nothing more than complaints about "the ordinary incidents of prison life" and should not be accorded constitutional status by Federal judges, the Chief Justice said.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist said that a series of Supreme Court opinions that treated such lawsuits as raising potential constitutional problems "has led to the involvement of Federal courts in the day-to-day management of prisons, often squandering judicial resources with little offsetting benefit to anyone." Instead, he said, judges should step aside and give prison officials the "flexibility" they need "in the fine-tuning of the ordinary incidents of prison life."</p>
        <p>The majority opinion, which bore the earmarks of a considerable struggle within the Court, provoked dissenting opinions from Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer, with Justices John Paul Stevens and David H. Souter also voting in dissent. Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined the majority opinion.</p>
        <p>In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ginsburg objected that because Chief Justice Rehnquist provided no examples of prisoner complaints that would meet the new standard, the majority opinion left "consumers of the Court's work at sea." Justice Breyer made a similar observation in his dissenting opinion. He said he was not certain whether the majority meant "to change prior law radically." If it did, he said, the opinion's "generality threatens the law with uncertainty."</p>
        <p>The decision, Sandin v. Conner, No. 93-1911, overturned a ruling in a case from Hawaii in which an inmate had been permitted to challenge officials' refusal to let him call witnesses at a disciplinary hearing that led to his being placed in solitary confinement for 30 days.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held in a 1993 ruling that the inmate had a "liberty interest," entitling him to a range of procedural protections, in remaining free from being placed in solitary confinement as punishment for misconduct.</p>
        <p>But the inmate, Demont Conner, had no such liberty interest, Chief Justice Rehnquist said, because the punishment he received "was within the range of confinement to be normally expected" given the sentence of 30 years to life that he was serving in a maximum-security prison for a number of crimes including murder.</p>
        <p>The term "liberty interest" was at the heart of the decision. The 14th Amendment provides that no state shall "deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law." As the Court has analyzed this provision in the context of prisons, the procedural protections of the due process clause such as the right to a hearing come into play only if the state's action has infringed on some separate, substantive right that the inmate possesses.</p>
        <p>For example, the Court ruled in 1974 that a Nebraska law providing for sentences to be shortened for good behavior created a "liberty interest" in a "shortened prison sentence"; if the inmate met the requirements, he could not be deprived of the shortened sentence without due process.</p>
        <p>The question for the Court today was how to decide which laws or prison regulations that offer inmates some potential benefit are worthy of constitutional protection as liberty interests.</p>
        <p>Chief Justice Rehnquist said that although the Court's early ventures into this territory, during the 1970's, properly separated the substantial from the trivial, a series of cases during the 1980's had driven the doctrine off track. The Court, improperly in his view, stopped examining the weight of the interest involved, and instead focused on whether the state had issued a regulation phrased in mandatory terms, no matter what the subject.</p>
        <p>By this analysis, the Chief Justice said, "the Court encouraged prisoners to comb regulations in search of mandatory language on which to base entitlements to various state-conferred privileges." At the same time, states and prison officials were discouraged from codifying regulations for fear that they would be conferring new constitutional rights on inmates.</p>
        <p>"The time has come to return to the due process principles" of the earlier cases, the Chief Justice said today. He said that while "states may under certain circumstances create liberty interests which are protected by the due process clause," these will be generally limited to actions that "impose atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life."</p>
        <p>Being placed in special disciplinary confinement does not meet that definition in this case, Chief Justice Rehnquist said. Noting that inmates in the maximum-security Halawa Correctional Facility in Hawaii are generally confined to their cells for most of the day, he said that Mr. Conner's solitary confinement for 30 days "did not work a major disruption in his environment." Since there was no liberty interest at stake, it was irrelevant whether prison officials had handled Mr. Conner's disciplinary hearing according to their regulations.</p>
        <p>"Admittedly, prisoners do not shed all constitutional rights at the prison gate," Chief Justice Rehnquist said. But he added: "Discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct falls within the expected parameters of the sentence imposed by a court of law."</p>
        <p>The decision did not change the Court's analysis of prisoners' rights under another constitutional provision, the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The Eighth Amendment has been used as the basis for lawsuits challenging conditions of confinement, including suits against guards who injure inmates.</p>
        <p>But Chief Justice Rehnquist made clear his exasperation with the Court's due process cases. His opinion included a list of recent cases in which prisoners have used the Court's precedents to claim liberty interests in receiving lunch on a tray rather than in a sack, in not being transferred to a cell lacking an electrical outlet for a television and in being on a certain diet.</p>
        <p>The decision did not directly overturn any of the Court's precedents. The only change necessary was one of emphasis, the Chief Justice indicated. "Our decision today only abandons an approach that in practice is difficult to administer and which produces anomalous results," he said.</p>
        <p>A puzzling aspect of the decision was that the dissenters made clear that, in their view, the Hawaii inmate had an extremely weak case at best. The record "does not show that Conner was denied any procedural protection warranted in his case," Justice Ginsburg said.</p>
        <p>Justice Breyer also agreed, in his dissenting opinion, that the inmate was not entitled to an additional hearing. He said the Court could have issued a narrow opinion making clear that lower courts were free to "separate the unimportant from the potentially significant" in analyzing what constitutes a liberty interest for a prisoner.</p>
        <p>The case was argued at the end of February, and given the broad agreement within the Court on the bottom line for this particular inmate, it is curious that it took Chief Justice Rehnquist, normally one of the Court's fastest writers, until now to issue his opinion. It is possible that the opinion began as a unanimous one, or nearly so, but that the dissents developed as it became clear that the Chief Justice was taking the opportunity to go beyond the specific issue in the case and write an opinion curbing a broad category of prisoners' lawsuits, a long-standing focus of the Chief Justice's interest.</p>
        <p>There were these other developments at the Court today: Abortion Clinics</p>
        <p>Without comment, the Court turned down a constitutional challenge to the 1994 law that makes it a Federal crime to use force, threats, or violence to obstruct abortion clinics or to intimidate or interfere with patients or doctors.</p>
        <p>The case, Woodall v. Reno, No. 94-1417, was the first to reach the Court on the constitutionality of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. There are other cases either at the Court or on their way, and it is possible that the Justices will agree to hear one of them.</p>
        <p>This case, brought by Concerned Women for America, an organization that opposes abortion, was based principally on the First Amendment right to free speech.  The Justice Department told the Court that the argument was based on a "fundamental misunderstanding" of the law, which the department said was concerned with conduct and not with speech. Christmas Lights</p>
        <p>Also without comment, the Court turned down an appeal by a Little Rock, Ark., couple who were ordered by the state courts to curb a massive display of 3.5 million Christmas lights at their home.</p>
        <p>The couple, Jennings and Mitzi Osborne, argued that the state courts had violated their right to religious expression under a 1993 Federal law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled in December that the Federal law did not protect the right to turn one's property into a "nuisance."</p>
        <p>The display, which the Osbornes began in 1986, drew attention for miles around their home. After the state court's ruling, they cut back to 175,000 lights last Christmas. Their neighbors, who were not mollified, are seeking to have the Osbornes held in contempt of earlier court orders. The couple's appeal was Osborne v. Power, No. 94-1742.
