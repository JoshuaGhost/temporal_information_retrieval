        <p>The school system will lose about $900 million, which officials have warned will lead to the elimination of thousands of school jobs, increases in class size and curtailment of programs, like some languages, music and art, that go beyond the bare basics required by the state.</p>

        <p>The school system will lose about $900 million, which officials have warned will lead to the elimination of thousands of school jobs, increases in class size and curtailment of programs, like some languages, music and art, that go beyond the bare basics required by the state.</p>
        <p>At one point during the tortuous budget process, Board of Education officials had estimated that the one million-student system faced cuts of up to $1 billion in the fiscal year that starts on July 1, but Tuesday's late-night agreement between the Mayor and the City Council led to the restoration of about $100 million in threatened cuts.</p>
        <p>While a spokesman for Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines, John Beckman, said yesterday that the board had not yet specifically determined what cuts would be made where, it "does seem highly likely that, given the size of this cut, cuts will be passed on to local districts and high school superintendencies."</p>
        <p>The board has approved an early-retirement plan for teachers and anticipates 2,100 to retire early. But the board's chief fiscal officer, Barry F. Sullivan, warned last week that layoffs are possible.</p>
        <p>Specifically, the new budget assumes $190 million in concessions from the 65,000 unionized teachers; $275 million in one-time savings and the use of any surplus from this year, and $435 million in administrative cuts and mandated, but unreimbursed, costs for programs like special education.</p>
        <p>The good news for parents, if they look hard enough, is that the Board of Education has voted to retain summer school for 95,000 high school students this year. And it voted down a proposal to save money on bus transportation by declaring 48,000 students ineligible, one-third of the 153,000 students now bused. This means, though, that the board's budget crunchers, however, will need to find $25 million in other items to make up the shortfall.</p>
        <p>In addition, City Hall and the Council have restored $200 million to the school system's capital budget. The money is to be used to help accommodate the 20,000 to 25,000 additional students entering the system next year and to repair the system's decrepit buildings, half of which are more than 50 years old.</p>
        <p>The board had initially requested $7.5 billion for the five-year capital plan, which is entering its second year, with most of the money for rehabilitations. Mr. Beckman said the Chancellor was grateful to the Mayor and the Council, but added that the capital budget as passed, at $2.9 billion, remains about one-third of the original $7.5 billion request.
