        <p>Donald Lanani was standing on a subway platform waiting for a train home from work yesterday when he saw a blur.</p>
        <p>"All of a sudden I noticed something floating through the air and falling straight down on the tracks in front of the train," Mr. Lanani, 40, said later. "It didn't take long to register, it was a person, someone small, maybe a kid."</p>
        <p>"I saw the motorwoman -- she was distressed -- and I heard a kind of gasp, it all happened so fast," he said last night from his home in Jackson Heights, Queens.</p>
        <p>Right on time at 5:28 P.M., five cars of the southbound train entered the station at 116th Street and Broadway, passing over the victim, a 35-year-old woman who Transit Authority officials said had tried to commit suicide. She fell between the tracks and escaped serious injury.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lanani, a Columbia University computer center teacher, did not know her condition as he ran to the spot where he saw her fall. Once the train stopped, he said, he lowered himself down from the platform between two cars to the tracks below.</p>
        <p>"It was an extremely brave act," Bob Slovak, a spokesman for the Transit Authority, said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanani said he crawled along the track "and looked and looked until I spotted something between the tracks."</p>
        <p>"It was a woman, and her face was lying in a pool of water," he said. "I crawled across the track and pulled her head up so she could breath and then felt to see if she suffered any injuries. But she seemed O.K., even if she seemed unconscious."</p>
        <p>'It was incredibly noisy and dark," he said. "I couldn't see anything and the power must have still been on the third rail because all I could hear was the train's compressors.</p>
        <p>"I must have been down there three, maybe five minutes. It seemed a lifetime. I was making sure her hand or legs did not touch the third rail, when someone shouted if we were O.K.</p>
        <p>"I yelled back, 'I'm here and we're all right,' " he said.</p>
        <p>"Someone yelled, 'Don't touch anything,' and I thought, 'Sure, good advice,' " he said. "I yelled, 'Get down here fast, she's alive.' They said an ambulance was on its way."</p>
        <p>"At that point, I felt my thumb being squeezed. She was apparently gaining consciousness. Then I had a chance to think what the hell I was doing down here in the noise and the darkness.</p>
        <p>"I just waited and waited, and finally they came for us from the other platform and I handed her off to one one of them," he said. "A couple of others got me out."</p>
        <p>Later, Mr. Lanani said he was told by the police that the woman had jumped.</p>
        <p>Shaken by the experience, Mr. Lanani said he asked the police for only two favors: a chance to call his wife, Isabel, to tell her why he was late, and for a ride home.</p>
        <p>Asked if he intended to visit the woman, who is being held for observation at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, Mr. Lanani said, "I should do it, but my only thought is, will she be thankful?"</p>
