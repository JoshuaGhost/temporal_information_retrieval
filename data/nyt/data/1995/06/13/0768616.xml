        <p>Last summer, it was the slip dress. This summer, the dress everyone seems to be wearing is the sleeveless shift. It's cool on a steamy day but more covered up than a slip, so it can go to the office without an added T-shirt.</p>
        <p>The most fashionable versions have the wide necklines favored by Audrey Hepburn in movies like "Sabrina." A solid color looks best, and the dress needs no accessories other than perhaps sunglasses. For evening, it can be dressed up with high-heel sandals.</p>
