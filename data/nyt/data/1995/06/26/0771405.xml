        <p>Prime Minister John Major's ploy of calling a snap election on his leadership of the Conservative Party, which looked like a brilliant stroke only three days ago, is beginning to look like a very dangerous gamble indeed.</p>
        <p>It may be that he underestimated the depth of passion among his party's right-wing "Euro-skeptics," who insist that he throw his full weight behind their efforts to hold the door against further integration of Britain into Europe.</p>
        <p>Or it may be that he did not fully appreciate the dark fears of the 329 Tory members of Parliament that they will be turned out in droves in the next election, sometime before the spring of 1997, unless they find a new, charismatic standard-bearer to rally the demoralized party.</p>
        <p>But what the Prime Minister's aides had hoped would be a cakewalk may turn out to be a slugfest. It depends upon the next few days when potential challengers consider their chances -- and the chances of those they dislike even more than Mr. Major -- before Thursday's deadline for registration. That turns the run-up to the contest into an elaborate game of liar's poker. The pot is the prime ministership.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, Mr. Major's decision to resign his party post and face all comers seemed inspired. For one thing, it made a man suffering from the "wimp factor" seem for a fleeting moment like a make-my-day kind of gunslinger. For another, it gave him the initiative; in November, when party rules permit it, he probably would have faced a challenge initiated by his opponents. This way, he's the dealer.</p>
        <p>But at this point the odds favoring the house are beginning to come down. A key to Mr. Major's strategy was that his whole Cabinet would stand behind him, along with the Tory leadership. A challenger would be a maverick or some disgruntled backbencher, facing an unbroken line of "men in gray suits," as the party elders are called. Why, such a contest might even add the glow of victor's laurels to Mr. Major's head.</p>
        <p>For the most part the declarations of Cabinet ministers have been heartily supportive. But there is, so far at least, one conspicuous hold-out, John Redwood, the Secretary for Wales, not a particularly well-known politician, but one of four or five Euro-skeptics in the Cabinet that Mr. Major once publicly referred to as "bastards." Already his silence may have cost him his Cabinet post, so he has little to lose.</p>
        <p>This means that if he makes a run for the leadership he is a much more lethal rallying point for the right-wing forces than Norman Lamont, another taciturn member of Parliament, whose opposition to Mr. Major can be put down to pique at being dropped two years ago as Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
        <p>The problem for Mr. Major is that the longer the race seems wide open, the more potential challengers may arise. And the cards he is showing are not very strong. As Robert Worcester, head of the MORI polling outfit, put it, "This is the least popular Prime Minister, leading the Government with the lowest share of the intended vote, in British polling history." The idea that it might be necessary to drop Mr. Major to win, as it was necessary to drop Margaret Thatcher in 1990, begins to sink in.</p>
        <p>The election procedure encourages a stalking horse, someone who is not a serious contender for Prime Minister but whose job is to show that the current office-holder is weak enough for others to move in for the kill. It's a bit like Russian roulette. If the Prime Minister does not win on the first ballot, there is a second ballot. In this one, those who pledged their support before may become challengers themselves.</p>
        <p>Should this happen, and it is by no means clear that it will, many experts see a battle shaping up between Michael Heseltine, the liberal pro-European trade minister, and Michael Portillo, the right-wing Euro-skeptic employment secretary. Mr. Portillo's backers have to calculate the danger of opposing Mr. Major the first time around only to see Mr. Heseltine beat their own man the second time, the worst of all possible worlds for them.</p>
        <p>Complicating the arithmetic is the fact that the ballots are secret, so no one really knows if pledges given publicly ahead of time will be honored. It is that piquant element that turns the game into liar's poker.</p>
