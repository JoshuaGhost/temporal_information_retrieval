        <p>Mitch Williams, unable to revive his career after a half-season retirement, was released yesterday by the California Angels. Williams, 30, the bullpen hero of Philadelphia's drive to the 1993 National League pennant, but the goat of the Phillies' loss to Toronto in the World Series, was 1-2 with a 6.75 earned run average in 20 games with the Angels. In 10 2/3 innings, Williams walked 21 and allowed 13 hits. (AP)</p>
