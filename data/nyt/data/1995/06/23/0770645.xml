        <p>Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Alan S. Blinder, the vice chairman, have talked in recent days about the possibility of lowering interest rates when the Fed's policy makers meet on July 5 and 6, senior Fed officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The conversations come against a backdrop of a steadily slowing economy. Mr. Blinder has publicly expressed concern that the economy might be weakening more than is necessary to control inflation. Now he appears ready to vote against any resolution at the July meeting that fails to lower interest rates, the senior officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan has not indicated his position for the July meeting. But in fact there is a chance that Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Blinder might both recommend a rate cut at that time, the Fed officials said. Joseph R. Coyne, chief spokesman for the Fed, said he had no comment on the reports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blinder, a Princeton University economist, and Janet Yellen, an economist on leave from the University of California at Berkeley, are President Clinton's only appointees to the Federal Reserve Board, which currently has six members. Ms. Yellen is also reported to favor a rate cut and might side with Mr. Blinder against any resolution that kept rates unchanged instead of lowering them.</p>
        <p>"The risks have increased on the down side," she said in an interview yesterday. She declined to state her position on a rate cut.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blinder and Mr. Greenspan have displayed some basic differences in how they view the economy. Mr. Blinder is reluctant to let the economy enter a sustained period of what he considers unnecessarily weak economic growth and rising unemployment. Mr. Greenspan has shown a willingness to let the economy come closer to recession if that keeps the rate of inflation from rising.</p>
        <p>He has said that reversing a rise in inflation, and the expectations it engenders of future price increases, is more difficult than reversing weak economic growth by eventually lowering interest rates to stimulate borrowing and spending. Mr. Blinder, in turn, says that in the short run, one is no harder to reverse than the other, so no good reason exists to let the economy become too weak and unemployment rise.</p>
        <p>The potential political stakes are considerable. A weak economy in 1996, a Presidential election year, could undermine Mr. Clinton's re-election prospects.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Blinder and Mr. Greenspan also have a lot at stake. If Mr. Clinton's appointees were to vote unsuccessfully for a rate cut and the economy were to revive later this year without the aid of such a cut, as some economists and several Fed policy makers believe might happen, then Mr. Greenspan might get the applause. That would come particularly from the financial markets, for his refusal to cut rates and thus prevent a rebound from becoming too robust and inflationary.</p>
        <p>"We are in a slowdown, we all know that, and it is impossible to tell how far it may go," said Edward W. Kelley Jr., a Fed governor. "But I believe there are very good reasons to be optimistic and after we work through this period now, we will return to growth."</p>
        <p>But if the economy were to continue to decline instead of rebounding, thus risking a recession and raising the unemployment rate, then the blame might focus much more on Mr. Greenspan. That might let Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen -- and by extension the Clinton Administration -- at least partly off the hook.</p>
        <p>The Fed's policy makers have raised short-term interest rates by three percentage points since early last year, with the last half-point increase taken on Feb. 1. Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen had argued against that last increase, but in the end they voted with the others for approval.</p>
        <p>"Dissent around here, any dissenting vote, is a big deal," Mr. Blinder said in an interview in March. "This is not like the Supreme Court, where you regularly get 6-3 or 5-4 votes. So you hold your fire until you feel you must shoot."</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve's policy makers generally approve their decisions concerning interest rates by unanimous or near-unanimous votes. Any departure from this collegial approach could result in volatility in the nation's stock and bond markets. These markets often respond favorably to what traders think is solid Fed policy, shared by the chairman, the vice chairman and the other governors, as well as most of the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks.</p>
        <p>Most recently, long-term interest rates have fallen on Treasury bonds, mortgages, car loans and the like because traders expect that the Federal Reserve will vote to reduce the Federal funds rate, which is the rate banks and other financial institutions pay to borrow for a day or two from each other. Through a ripple effect, changes in the Federal funds rate eventually bring changes on many other rates paid by consumers and business to borrow money.</p>
        <p>As a matter of practice, Mr. Greenspan's recommendations concerning interest rates have prevailed at virtually every meeting since he became Fed chairman in 1987, and his view of what should be done now seems likely to prevail at the early July meeting, however Mr. Blinder and Ms. Yellen -- or others -- might vote.</p>
        <p>The last time a Fed chairman and vice chairman voted against each other was in February 1986, when Paul A. Volcker, the chairman, and Preston Martin, the vice chairman, disagreed not on whether to cut the discount rate, but when. This is the rate that the Fed itself charges to lend money to banks. Any changes are made at one of the weekly meetings of the Fed's seven governors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Volcker wanted to wait until the Japanese and German central banks made similar rate cuts. Mr. Martin, joined by three other governors, voted to act immediately. The two sides finally agreed to defer action.</p>
        <p>The coming July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee brings together the governors as well as the 12 regional bank presidents. They meet every six to eight weeks to consider changes in the Federal funds rate, which has a much bigger impact on the economy than the discount rate.</p>
