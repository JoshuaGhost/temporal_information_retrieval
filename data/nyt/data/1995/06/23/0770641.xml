        <p>Now, the biggest remaining questions deal with the aftermath of what is almost certain to be a Stanley Cup championship for the Devils.</p>
        <p>Will they hold a parade, and, if so, where? Will Claude Lemieux win the Conn Smythe Trophy as most valuable player in the playoffs, or will it go to Martin Brodeur or Scott Stevens?</p>
        <p>Will the star-studded Detroit Red Wings salvage even one victory to send this one-sided championship series back to Detroit? Will Scotty Bowman return to coach these players next season after attacking them with fierce and bitter words?</p>
        <p>Will Commissioner Gary Bettman dare present the trophy if it is clinched on Bergen County ice? And will the champion Devils open next season back at Byrne Meadowlands Arena or will they raise their banner in a minor-league rink in Tennessee?</p>
        <p>These were the issues after the Devils scored early and often en route to a 5-2 victory over the Red Wings and a 3-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game finals. The Red Wings didn't exactly quit, as Bowman suggested, but they were demoralized, discouraged and maybe dismayed.</p>
        <p>They won't ever admit it, but they underestimated the Devils, who got little notice during the regular season. Going into the series, the debate on sports talk radio in the Motor City varied between "the Wings will sweep" and "the Wings will win the cup, but maybe not in a sweep."</p>
        <p>Perhaps they were fooled by their regular-season schedule in the weaker Western Conference, with foes like Anaheim, Los Angeles, Winnipeg and Edmonton. Bowman used words like "embarrass" and "humiliate" and said his team "didn't compete."</p>
        <p>"You can't fool around," he said. "This is the truth."</p>
        <p>Bowman often speaks in a stream of consciousness, his words meandering through complex thickets of thought. Tonight, his words were as terse and as blunt as punches to the gut. He said he told his players that "some of you don't need to take a shower" after their effort tonight.</p>
        <p>Done with his contract, one would wonder if Bowman would be anxious to return or how the players would respond to him if he did. He didn't spare himself or his staff, either. He wondered aloud what their peers in the players association thought about them.</p>
        <p>The Devils' fans, deferential during the 13 years of the franchise, are starting to rub it in a little bit by mocking Detroit's octopus mania. While the sound system played "Octopus's Garden" by the Beatles, the videotape showed the Devils mascot on a wooden pier, looking into the water and stabbing an octopus with his pitchfork. After goals, they littered the ice with a wide variety of sea creatures.</p>
        <p>Don't forget, fans: Game on! Tomorrow night, on Fox.</p>
        <p>Devils players, mindful of Game 4, tried not to say anything negative about their foes. Randy McKay said the Wings "came out and tried a little" but added "we might have taken a little gas out of them."</p>
        <p>Lemieux said, "We can't forget that was the team that was favored to sweep and then in five or six games. When you think you have it made, then that is when you're in trouble."</p>
        <p>He was speaking of his team, not the visitors.</p>
        <p>Lemieux scored his league-high 13th goal in the first period and will probably win the Smythe. The goals alone make him a strong candidate, but some might argue that his defensive play has been better than his offensive play.</p>
        <p>If Lemieux doesn't win the award, there will be some sentiment for Brodeur because no team wins the Cup without good goaltending.</p>
        <p>But the Devils' tight style makes good goalies look great by holding down shots and scoring chances. Stevens has been the best defenseman on a defensive-oriented team, but his point totals in four rounds -- 1 goal and 7 assists in 19 games -- will cost him ballots.</p>
        <p>After Lemieux, Brodeur, Stevens and their teammates eventually clinch it, here tomorrow or some time later, the heavy, hard issues will turn the focus to John McMullen, the team owner, and Bettman, the commissioner.</p>
        <p>By threatening to move to Nashville if he doesn't get a better lease deal, McMullen has already tainted what should be an unfettered time of rejoicing for a local businessman who has made good. Bettman's vague statements have encouraged the speculation, a tacky tactic not lost on the growing horde of Devils fans.</p>
        <p>Just as he did when he orchestrated a labor lockout that delayed the season for 15 weeks, Bettman has shown he doesn't mind playing the heavy on behalf of owners, against the fans. He already travels with a security entourage. Will the bodyguards accompany him on the ice for a presentation?</p>
        <p>The players and the coach on the team deserve their championship; they've prevailed convincingly; their discipline and cohesive play are a joy for a purist to watch, if not for the casual fan. But the bitter words of the losing coach and the carpetbagging threat from the winning team contribute to a suitably shabby ending for a ragged season.</p>
