        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In "Arts for Our Sake" (Op-Ed, June 21), Hillary Rodham Clinton offers a heartfelt sermon about the importance of arts in American life, and their need for public and private support. I agree.</p>
        <p>But I do not believe that continuing the National Endowment for the Arts as currently organized fills that need efficiently.</p>
        <p>This 30-year-old agency spends more than half its budget on administration, questionable studies and allied lobbyists. Its grants are heavily skewed toward such European arts as opera and classical music, for example, while dribbling out pittances to America's greatest gift to world music -- jazz.</p>
        <p>The N.E.A.'s worst problem is that it is beholden to the 535 discriminating arts connoisseurs in Congress. Obtaining its reauthorization every two or three years, and its annual appropriation (currently a pitiful $167 million), is like driving a fragile sled through a pack of ravening Siberian wolves. No wonder the endowment's chairwoman, Jane Alexander, boasts that her agency funds programs in every Congressional district!</p>
        <p>There are better ways to fund the arts than this wasteful, discriminatory and ineffectual system. One would be to empower new audiences, not "experts" and Congress, to decide what and whom to fund.</p>
        <p>Federal money should go for locating and supporting new arts venues, such as school auditoriums, public buildings and shopping centers. Another would be to distribute vouchers for arts admission at schools and colleges, senior centers and community organizations. Arts institutions would be reimbursed for the vouchers they redeem. Such a system would indeed provide more than "pleasant esthetics," as Mrs. Clinton urges, but also, as she adds, "help move us forward as a democracy."
