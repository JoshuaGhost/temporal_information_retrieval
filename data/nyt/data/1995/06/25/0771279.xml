        <p>The ramps connecting the Cross Island Parkway to the Throgs Neck Bridge, under renovation since January, were reopened on Wednesday afternoon, more than two months ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>The $7 million project was undertaken to repair potholes that had allowed salt to penetrate over the years, cracking the ramp's steel reinforcements and sending pieces of concrete falling to the road. Completion had been scheduled by Labor Day.</p>
        <p>"We're especially pleased to re-open the ramps in early summer to handle the increased volume due to vacation travel in addition to our regular commuter customers," said Michael C. Ascher, president of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority.</p>
        <p>The contractor, the DeFoe Corporation of Mount Vernon, which received a $1 million bonus for its early completion of the project, replaced the original seven-and-half-inch thick concrete ramp roadway slabs with nine-inch ones, installed new metal expansion joints and changed the support bearings.</p>
        <p>New reflective lane markings, signs and guide rails were also installed. J.H.L.  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: WHITESTONE/COLLEGE POINT</p>
