        <p>I read with interest your June 1 Arts pages article on the reopening of the Beverly Hills Hotel, as my family moved to Beverly Hills in 1923 just two blocks down Beverly Drive from it.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest your June 1 Arts pages article on the reopening of the Beverly Hills Hotel, as my family moved to Beverly Hills in 1923 just two blocks down Beverly Drive from it. I used to catch polliwogs in the park's pond across the street from the hotel and, much later, had lunch in the Polo Lounge and my hair cut in the barbershop.</p>
        <p>During the Depression one could stay at the hotel for $12 a night.</p>
        <p>The Beverly Hills Hotel was not the only Mission-style hostelry in Southern California. There was the similarly styled Hollywood Hotel at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue and the Mission Inn in Riverside.</p>
        <p>The green palm tree wallpaper at the Beverly Hills was the inspiration of the designer Don Loper. The Polo Lounge was so named because Will Rogers (onetime honorary mayor of Beverly Hills), Darryl F. Zanuck and other polo players used to gather there after matches at the Will Rogers Polo Grounds. And Gloria Swanson's home was across the street.</p>
        <p>But why your Hollywood dateline? Beverly Hills is and was, when the hotel opened, an incorporated city. Hollywood has a post office, but was never more than a Los Angeles suburb, east of Beverly Hills. JACK HYDE  New York, June 1, 1995 The writer is a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology.</p>
