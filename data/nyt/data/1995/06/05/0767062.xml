        <p>As candidate for governor, George Pataki pledged not only to reduce spending and taxes but to eliminate the secrecy and gimmickry by which the state puts together its budget each year. Though we disagree with his approach, he succeeded in wresting a budget from the Legislature that embodies his broad objectives.</p>
        <p>But he abandoned his promise to open the doors to the back-room horse trading and reject fiscal gimmickry. The failure to change Albany's secretive budget process undermines Mr. Pataki's aspirations to be a reform governor who corrected the abuses that offended him as a legislator.</p>
        <p>There were two phases to the budget deliberations this year, both unedifying. First, Mr. Pataki presented his demands for sweeping cuts in spending and taxes. He and the Democrats then spent several weeks in mutual vilification. In the second phase, after New Yorkers got tired of the ad campaigns and speeches, the two sides imposed a press blackout, never letting voters or junior legislators see how they were rewriting the basic rules of the health and welfare safety net, the tax code and criminal justice procedures.</p>
        <p>The result is that the public has not really been educated about the coming impact of Mr. Pataki's program on hospitals, schools, nursing homes, mental health institutions and agencies that care for children from troubled families. It is doubtful that beyond the slogans of everyone wanting less government there is a consensus among the public about weakening the system of institutions that provide care for needy people in the state. If the cuts backfire or hurt people, the voters will be right to blame Mr. Pataki for not discussing them openly.</p>
        <p>Despite many promises from the Governor to do things differently this year, the budget was put together in the traditional slapdash way, with nearly $1 billion in one-time-only revenues that will not be around next year to pay for spending that recurs. The budget has also been "balanced" by optimistic projections on the savings to be achieved in welfare and Medicaid resulting from the agreed-upon cutbacks. Within the next few months, the state may well have to revise its budget when the savings that are projected do not materialize. The overly generous tax cut, phased in over three years, will almost certainly have to be scaled back next year when the Legislature realizes that there is no money to pay for it.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the toughest lesson Mr. Pataki had to learn was the strength of two men almost unknown to the general public. Gov. Mario Cuomo came to regard his Democratic allies in the Legislature as nearly as much of a thorn in his side as the Republicans, because of their demands for spending in favored programs. Now Governor Pataki has been frustrated in having to make concessions to both the Democratic Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, and the Republican Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno. The Republicans, in the end, fought for spending restorations in Mr. Pataki's proposed cuts for schools, hospitals and nursing homes, all powerful constituents in their districts.</p>
        <p>Despite everyone's talk of austerity, the process in its last phase collapsed into the annual "restoration comedy" -- with money restored for stadiums, road construction, pension sweeteners and other pet projects for legislators. An estimated $24 million in spending for such projects, plus an unspecified sum for pension improvements for older retirees, is especially unconscionable in a year of pitiless budget cuts in other areas.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was impossible, this year, for this last ugly phase of Albany politicking to be eliminated. The strength of Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno to push through unpleasant budget cuts depends in some measure on their use of patronage to enforce legislative discipline. But a saner, more open budget process cannot be achieved without a governor willing to confront the strong leader system. It is a lesson that Mr. Pataki learned painfully. Perhaps now he can learn to overcome it and institute real reform of the process in Albany.</p>
