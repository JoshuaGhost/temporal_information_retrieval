        <p>Leaders of seven major industrial democracies sat down today to their self-appointed task of overhauling the world's financial institutions to better handle crises like the crash of the Mexican peso that shook world financial markets early this year.</p>
        <p>To the skirl of Scottish bagpipes and the flag waving of hundreds of cheering onlookers, the leaders arrived in this center of Canada's Atlantic provinces, and after ceremonies under a sunny sky went into a working dinner to discuss financial matters.</p>
        <p>Before the dinner, President Clinton and Japan's Prime Minister, Tomiichi Murayama, sought to prevent a festering trade dispute over cars and car parts from overshadowing the economic summit meeting in this port city. But it was unclear whether their trade lieutenants would be able to resolve the conflict at another round of talks scheduled June 22-23 in Geneva.</p>
        <p>Their discussions shortly after arriving in Halifax for the annual gathering of the Group of Seven left open the possibility of a compromise to forestall trade sanctions President Clinton has ordered to go into effect on June 28.</p>
        <p>In the background of the economic discussions is an enormous increase in international financial transactions, which has accentuated the vulnerability of markets to shocks like the one from the peso devaluation. To prevent the collapse of the Mexican economy, the United States and the International Monetary Fund pumped nearly $40 billion into support for the peso.</p>
        <p>Over the last decade, bond issues have tripled, securities transactions have increased more than tenfold, and foreign exchange transactions have quadrupled to $1 trillion a day, according to the International Monetary Fund, the Washington-based institution that tries to help countries in financial trouble.</p>
        <p>"We cannot simply expect those famous currency speculators to shut off their computer terminals, hang up their red suspenders and get a life," said Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada, the host at the three-day summit meeting. "But what we can do -- what we must do -- is take effective, concrete action to minimize the vulnerability of national economies."</p>
        <p>Among measures the leaders will look at are ways to improve the early-warning capabilities of the I.M.F. to respond more quickly to crises and to increase its resources to permit faster such response.</p>
        <p>A senior Canadian official said the measures would mean that "various surprises in the market will be much less likely in the future."</p>
        <p>Another idea on the front burner, Canadian and American officials said, is the creation of a kind of international bankruptcy court in which the I.M.F. could stop debt payments by insolvent nations, organize new borrowing, and approve a plan to pay off creditors, much as courts now do under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings with private corporations.</p>
        <p>Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin accompanied the President here, along with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to reassure investors that Washington supports a stronger dollar, Mr. Rubin said after a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura, that he and Mr. Takemura had reaffirmed a finance ministers' assessment that exchange rates in Group of Seven countries were "out of sync with the fundamentals."</p>
        <p>Japanese officials attribute their country's weakening economic performance this year to the persistent strength of the yen.</p>
        <p>At the April meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington, a closing statement spoke of the need for an "orderly reversal of exchange rate movements."</p>
        <p>The leaders of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy -- arrived at Shearwater, a Canadian Forces base near here. In separate entourages, they sailed across one of the world's deepest harbors into Halifax.</p>
        <p>The Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, joins the Group of Seven leaders on Friday for political discussions that are almost certain to include conditions in Bosnia, where more than 15,000 Bosnian Government troops are massed around Sarajevo for what looks like preparation for a major offensive.</p>
        <p>President Clinton's party took 20 minutes to cross the harbor aboard a brilliantly orange-colored 300-foot Canadian icebreaker, the Sir William Alexander.</p>
        <p>As they neared a wharf in the restored waterfront, a bagpiper pealed out a Scottish ballad from a bluff on nearby St. George's Island. A squad of eight police boats, equipped with twin 150-horsepower engines, flanked the Presidential vessel.</p>
        <p>Although security is tight around a downtown square kilometer known as the "red zone," where the meetings are being held, there was an air of festivity and celebration, which had all the trappings of a giant Nova Scotia kitchen party.</p>
        <p>Two outdoor rock bands drowned out the bagpipes. Buildings flew the Canadian maple leaf, the Union Jack and the blue cross of St. Andrew, the flag of Nova Scotia.</p>
        <p>Canadian authorities have encouraged people to come downtown.  INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS</p>
