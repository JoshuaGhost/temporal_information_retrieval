        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged a Salomon Brothers analyst and his father with trading on inside information ahead of the announcement of a proposed merger between the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the cable giants Tele-Communications Inc. and the Liberty Media Corporation.</p>
        <p>Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management and Moran &amp; Associates, a money management firm and securities brokerage firm, respectively, was accused of buying hundreds of thousands of shares of Tele-Communications and Liberty Media in the two days before the announcement, based on a tip from his son, Frederick W.

        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged a Salomon Brothers analyst and his father with trading on inside information ahead of the announcement of a proposed merger between the Bell Atlantic Corporation and the cable giants Tele-Communications Inc. and the Liberty Media Corporation.</p>
        <p>Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management and Moran &amp; Associates, a money management firm and securities brokerage firm, respectively, was accused of buying hundreds of thousands of shares of Tele-Communications and Liberty Media in the two days before the announcement, based on a tip from his son, Frederick W. Moran, a telecommunications analyst at Salomon Brothers. Salomon was representing Bell Atlantic. The proposed merger of the communications companies fell through in early 1994.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. said the trading of the senior Mr. Moran in Tele-Communications and Liberty shares resulted in $2.4 million in illegal profits. It also accused the senior Mr. Moran of defrauding clients of his money management firm and accused his firms, both based in Greenwich, Conn., of making misstatements and omissions in S.E.C. filings.</p>
        <p>Thomas C. Newkirk, associate director of the S.E.C.'s division of enforcement, said, "He failed to disclose that his son was a director of his two businesses." Mr. Moran dismissed it as an oversight by his clerical staff.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. wants the Morans to turn over any profits from the trading and pay civil penalties.</p>
        <p>The senior Mr. Moran said he had no intention of settling. "They don't have a case," he said. "It's a joke. They put together a lot of circumstantial nonsense, and they have also mispresented the facts."</p>
        <p>His son sent a letter to clients and colleagues saying that the S.E.C.'s allegations of illegal insider trading were false. "Now, because of a coincidence of events, we are unfairly accused of wrongdoing," he wrote.</p>
        <p>Salomon Brothers, the securities unit of Salomon Inc., said yesterday that the younger Mr. Moran, who follows the telecommunications industry, had been suspended from working with clients and would not have access to confidential information. Salomon, which was not named in the S.E.C. case, added, however, that its lawyers had not found reason to conclude that the younger Mr. Moran had violated securities law.</p>
        <p>In its court documents, the S.E.C. contended that Mr. Moran used information gleaned from his son, who first knew of talks between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications on Oct. 3, 1993, in deciding to buy 340,799 shares of Tele-Communications class A common stock and 203,200 shares of Liberty class A stock on Oct. 11 and Oct. 12. When the market closed on Oct. 13, the day the announcement was made, "accounts controlled by Moran Sr. had made aggregate profits of approximately $1,729,000 and $709,000 from the trading of T.C.I. and Liberty, respectively," the S.E.C. said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moran said those were paper profits and that when he finally sold the stock several months later, he actually lost money.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. also contended that on Oct. 11, Mr. Moran reallocated Liberty stock that was originally intended for customer accounts into his personal and his family's accounts. Moran Asset Management purchased more Liberty stock at a higher price the next day for its customer accounts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moran said the stock was moved into his personal and family accounts because it had been accidentally purchased for an institutional client, whose investment parameters prohibited investments in any company with a market capitalization of more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>The case against the Morans is the second that the S.E.C. has brought charging members of a family with using inside information to profit from trading in advance of the Bell Atlantic-Tele-Communications announcement "and our investigation is continuing," Mr. Newkirk said. The first case, brought last December against the son of a Tele-Communications executive, was settled for an undisclosed amount.</p>
