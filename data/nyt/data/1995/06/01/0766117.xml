        <p>When the Supreme Court overturned the so-called Gun-Free School Zones Act of  1990, the ban on guns within a thousand feet of a school, it said Congress had exceeded the Government's power over interstate commerce. But there was a nonlegal reason for sinking the statute: its name.</p>
        <p>The act is one of many laws with names so manipulative that only a brave legislator would dare vote against them. In the case of the Gun-Free School Zones Act, would urban lawmakers want critics to charge they favored guns in playgrounds?</p>

        <p>When the Supreme Court overturned the so-called Gun-Free School Zones Act of  1990, the ban on guns within a thousand feet of a school, it said Congress had exceeded the Government's power over interstate commerce. But there was a nonlegal reason for sinking the statute: its name.</p>
        <p>The act is one of many laws with names so manipulative that only a brave legislator would dare vote against them. In the case of the Gun-Free School Zones Act, would urban lawmakers want critics to charge they favored guns in playgrounds?</p>
        <p>This trend is not limited to legislation favored by liberals. The Contract With America would give us the American Dream Restoration Act, the Common Sense  Legal Reforms Act and the Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act. Who could vote  against restoring the American dream, common sense and jobs?</p>
        <p>At the other end of the political spectrum, what about the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1992, which overturned Supreme Court decisions that had narrowed anti-discrimination provisions? The need for that law aside, its title  implied that the 14th Amendment had been wiped from the books.</p>
        <p>Congress has long passed laws with loaded names. Take the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act  (1970). Wouldn't a legislator think twice before voting against "industrial recovery" and for crooks?</p>
        <p>My current favorite is the Healthy Meals for Healthy Americans Act of 1994. Its supporters could claim that its opponents were pro-heart attack.</p>
        <p>If Congress had gone for panache when it named old standbys, what would it have called the Judiciary Act of 1789, which established the Federal courts? The old names were a little boring, but they got the job done. They did not lend themselves to not-so-subliminal suggestions about how a member of Congress should vote. How about a moratorium on words like Enhancement, Improvement, Reform and Restoration in any act of Congress?</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration is preparing legislation to correct the deficiency that led the Supreme Court to overturn the ban on guns near schools. Whatever the content, let's hope the new bill will have a less operatic title. How about  the Gun Act?</p>
