        <p>Intuit lost its hope of being bought when the Justice Department blocked Microsoft's bid, but its software is still popular. The latest figures show that in April it had the two best selling business productivity programs for the Microsoft environment, and two of the top three for the macintosh environment. Lotus has no top sellers on the list. But its shareholders have something much more valuable: an offer from I.B.M., which Lotus's board accepted yesterday after it was sweetened to $64 a share. The original offer led Lotus's stock price to leap 93.5 percent to $62.875, above the $60 I.B.M. first offered. This made Lotus the No. 1 gainer among technology stocks last week.</p>
