        <p>You propose in "That'll Be Mrs. to You, Boomers" (Week in Review, May 28) that you see evidence of a backlash against feminism, and a further split between the "boomer" and "buster" generations. "Mrs. is back," you declare. "Chalk it up to nostalgia from a generation whose mothers shucked tradition for  careers and the work force."</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You propose in "That'll Be Mrs. to You, Boomers" (Week in Review, May 28) that you see evidence of a backlash against feminism, and a further split between the "boomer" and "buster" generations. "Mrs. is back," you declare. "Chalk it up to nostalgia from a generation whose mothers shucked tradition for  careers and the work force."</p>
        <p>This is journalism from the "my friends are doing it, so it must be a trend" school. As evidence for a return to tradition among young women, you cite a 4 percent drop in newly married women in Mamaroneck, N.Y., who kept their surnames and "a slight drop" among women listing marriage announcements in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>You add to this the musings of a variety of people who sense that something's afoot.</p>
        <p>If you provide evidence of anything, it is of the similarity between women in their 20's and baby boomers. The American Demographics study you cite shows that married women in their 20's were just as likely as those in their 30's (the younger boomers) not to take their husbands' names (14 percent).</p>
        <p>This is a higher percentage than is found among older women, a statistic that supports the conclusion that young women are continuing the trend begun by the baby boomers.</p>
        <p>As you point out, the survey for American Demographics also found that women  with more education were more likely to eschew taking their husbands' names. Because younger generations of women are going to college in record proportions, the likelihood that they will keep their birth names should, if anything, increase.</p>
        <p>It is important to keep an eye out for early signs of social change, but a few anecdotes are not evidence of a movement.</p>
