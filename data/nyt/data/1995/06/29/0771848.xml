        <p>For a couple of hours tonight, New Jersey sports fans tried to focus on the fact that a team with their name on it had finally won a national championship, and tried to forget the glory might last, well, one night.</p>
        <p>There they were, the New Jersey Devils hockey team, brandishing that gleaming Stanley Cup trophy aloft and drinking in the ecstatic roar of more than 25,000 fans at a victory celebration outside the Byrne Meadowlands Arena. And their next stop could well be Nashville.</p>
        <p>"It is the only New Jersey team that has ever done anything," said Tom H. Tyler, 23, who added that he had been a diehard fan for a decade. "We finally have a team we like and they want to get rid of them."</p>
        <p>He had scrawled on a large sheet, "The Devils Finally Got Respect, Now How About The Fans?"</p>
        <p>Respect has always been an elusive quality for New Jersey, caught in the eternal squeeze between New York and Philadelphia. The football Giants and Jets, lured out to the Meadowlands stadium in the landfill between endless highway interchanges, clung to their New York names. And when the Devils did stick New Jersey on their name after they moved here in 1982, such authorities as the hockey star Wayne Gretzky called them a Mickey Mouse operation.</p>
        <p>When the Devils defeated the Detroit Red Wings to win the National Hockey League championship, fans thought all that was behind them. Even the singer warming them up before the two-hour pep-rally-in-lieu-of-parade in the parking lot of the Byrne arena tried to get into the act. "Give the Devils a little respect now," she sang, changing the lyrics to one of Aretha Franklin's signature tunes.</p>
        <p>Fans were eager to grab a piece of that glory. "I have been going to these games for 13 years," said Adam J. Colaizzi, 27, of Wayne, N.J. "I went when there were empty stands. I've earned this. This is mine."</p>
        <p>The throng seem divided between those that thought the team would stick around and those that thought the Devils might be off by tomorrow. "I don't think they are going," said Terry Elster, 43. "Call it denial."</p>
        <p>Michael S. Kivitt, 13, had painted "Devils" in black paint across his forehead and the insignia on his cheek in red, but said he was sure the team would not be there next year. He was trying to decide whom he would support if the Devils left. "I guess we'll have to support the Pittsburgh Penguins or Boston," he said. "Never the Rangers!"</p>
        <p>The atmosphere was a cross between a sprawling family barbecue and a rock concert, and no one seemed too bothered by the fact that New Jersey did not have a city big enough or central enough to give the team a ticker-tape parade, the accolade given New York teams on Broadway. The Devils just circled the parking lot in convertibles for 15 minutes and then danced up onto the giant stage with their families, rock tunes blaring from the speakers.</p>
        <p>"Hanging out a window in the middle of Manhattan you take your life in your own hands," Mr. Colaizzi said. "Here my feet are flat on the ground, I can see everyone. It's home."</p>
        <p>But all the cheering, all the red-sequined devils horns, all the beer and the barbecued hot dogs, even the arrival of the huge silver trophy in a helicopter could not quite dispel the gloom of possibly losing the team.</p>
        <p>Some blamed the National Hockey League. It thinks there are too many teams in the region. Some blamed the Devils' owner, John McCullen. He wants too much money. (Not popular, he stayed off the stage.) Some blamed the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority. That dinosaur of an arena, what does it have, 29 luxury boxes?</p>
        <p>But everyone blamed Nashville, which has been promising all kinds of money if the team would just switch. The most popular two-word chant of the evening was unprintable, but the first word was "Nashville."</p>
        <p>Loyal fans said the team would never get the same reception down south. "Most of the guys down there are going to be fishing rather than watching hockey," said James R. Brown, 47, of Keansburg, N.J.</p>
        <p>There was no short supply of posters pouring derision on Nashville.</p>
        <p>"Nashville Take the Rangers" or "Elvis is not invited."</p>
        <p>Some hand-held signs resorted to poetry: "We believed. We dreamed and now you're going to leave. This news has us steamed."</p>
        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has pledged to keep the Devils but not dish out extensive state money to do it, was the target of one poster. "No Devils, No Whitman," it said.</p>
        <p>When her face appeared on the giant 20-foot-by-20-foot television screen above the stage that was showing ceremony highlights, the crowd erupted in a deafening roar of boos.</p>
        <p>"People are really confused and upset," the Governor said before making her way onto the stage. "I'm on their side so it's not a problem." She would not take questions on the negotiations, saying it was only a night for celebrations.</p>
        <p>After she spoke, the team players briefly thanked their fans and the sky exploded in fireworks. The fans hung on a little longer, many chanting their slogan from the playoffs, "Let's go Devils," as though they wanted to hang onto the sweet tang of victory forever.</p>
        <p>Three generations of women from the Fischer family wandered around the parking lots. The grandmother, Vera A. Fischer, 67, from Brooklyn, lifted her aluminum cane and pointed out a sign reading "McMullen Is a Greedy Old Man" to her granddaughter, Beth A. Coogan.</p>
        <p>"That sign is perfectly right," she told the girl, who was first taken to hockey games at age 3 by the middle member of the party, Theresa A. Coogan, 44, of Rutherford, N.J. Mrs. Coogan reeled off her season-ticket seat numbers for the last 10 years and said there was one thing that could never change no matter where the team went.</p>
        <p>"They can't take the Stanley Cup away from us," she said. "It will always say the New Jersey Devils."  HOCKEY</p>
