        <p>The rough new politics of Medicaid erupted before the Senate Finance Committee today as a panel of governors debated Republican proposals to cut $180 billion over seven years from the health insurance program for the poor and the disabled.</p>
        <p>Democratic governors contended that the cuts could be devastating and far exceeded what could be achieved through greater use of managed care or giving the states greater administrative flexibility, as the Republicans have promised. Republican governors were generally more supportive.</p>
        <p>Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, suggested that the savings from managed care were limited because so much of the Medicaid program in the states went to nursing home care for the impoverished elderly, whose needs are unlikely to be met through managed care programs like health maintenance organizations.</p>
        <p>But Republican governors suggested they could provide adequate care under the Republican budget, as Gov. Jim Edgar of Illinois put it. What they wanted, they said, was wide discretion on how to spend that money.  "If we are to help balance the Federal budget as well as balance our own budgets, we must have the flexibility and freedom that I believe block grants will provide," Mr. Edgar said.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans on Capitol Hill are hoping to meet their budget goals by converting Medicaid to a block grant -- limited lump sum payments that states could use as they choose. Until now, Medicaid has been jointly financed by the states and the Federal Government, and is an entitlement program that covers every eligible person.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders have argued that the block grant approach would free governors from meddlesome Federal regulations. But Democratic senators suggested today that the governors had, in essence, been given a bad deal, with a promise of no-strings administrative power, but a Federal allocation so stringent that little can be done with it.</p>
        <p>"I sometimes wish you'd thought it over a little longer back in January," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana said, "What you'll find when we give you that block grant is it's a boxful of problems and less money."</p>
        <p>Another issue that arose today was the complaint of governors, Democratic and Republican alike, from fast-growing states, who argued that they needed special consideration, and additional money, under any restructured Medicaid program.</p>
        <p>Another major issue is whether the Federal Government should set some basic standards for the Medicaid program, even if it is converting it to a block grant. Senator David Pryor, Democrat of Arkansas, said simply handing over a block grant was "sort of playing jump ball" in state legislatures, where there are powerful competing interests that might have a variety of uses in mind for the money.
