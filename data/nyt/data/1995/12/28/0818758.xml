        <p>Stocks were mixed yesterday in thin trading, amid continuing expectations that the Federal Reserve would again reduce interest rates.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one point gained more than 16 points, ended down 4.34 points, at 5,105.92. The Nasdaq composite index dropped  1.24 points, to 1,048.13, but the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.23 point, to 614.53.</p>

        <p>Stocks were mixed yesterday in thin trading, amid continuing expectations that the Federal Reserve would again reduce interest rates.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average, which at one point gained more than 16 points, ended down 4.34 points, at 5,105.92. The Nasdaq composite index dropped  1.24 points, to 1,048.13, but the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.23 point, to 614.53.</p>
        <p>It was a fairly directionless day," said Hugh A. Johnson, senior vice president of the First Albany Corporation. "The trading was largely tax driven."</p>
        <p>Reports yesterday of declines in the Conference Board's consumer confidence index and in the National Association of Realtors's tally of home resales underlined the signs of economic slowdown in recent months. These announcements  bolstered the bond market, where the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond jumped almost half of a percentage point in price and its yield fell to 6 percent.</p>
        <p>"This was somewhat encouraging to the stock market," Mr. Johnson said. "The strength in bonds prevented stocks from going into a swoon."</p>
        <p>Advancing issues outpaced declines on the New York Stock Exchange, by 1,328 to 985. Big Board volume climbed to 252.3 million shares from the unusually slow 217 million shares on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Some sectors, notably finance, rose on the anticipation of lower rates. When  rates dip, lenders usually benefit from a greater spread between what they receive from their assets and pay for their liabilities.</p>
        <p>Federal National Mortgage surged 5 1/4, to 125, after declaring a 4-for-1 stock split and saying that it will sell $1 billion of preferred to repurchase common shares. PNC advanced 1 3/8, to 31 1/2; Bankers Trust increased 1 1/4, to  67 1/2; and First Chicago rose 1 5/8, to 39 7/8.</p>
        <p>Tobacco stocks, which typically move higher in a slowing economy, finished on the upside yesterday. Philip Morris closed at 90 3/4, up 1 1/4; UST Inc. closed  at 34 3/4, up1/8, and American Brands closed at 44 3/4, up 1/8.</p>
        <p>However, the drug stocks were led downward as traders rotated away from the group. Merck declined 1 3/4, to 64 7/8; Eli Lilly fell 1 1/4, to 55 1/4; and Schering-Plough dropped 5/8, to 54 7/8.</p>
        <p>A broad range of economically sensitive technology stocks also moved lower. Included were semiconductor stocks like Intel, down 1/2, to 58 7/8, software companies like Microsoft, off 1 3/8, to 88 7/8, and computer systems like Compaq, down 1 1/8, to 48 3/4.</p>
        <p>Aluminum stocks were weak, apparently because of worries that demand will fall in 1996. Alcoa slid 1 3/4, to 49 3/4 and Reynolds Metals lost 1, to 53.</p>
        <p>Among the special situations, Cordis slumped 11 1/4, or 11 percent, to 95 1/4, after Johnson &amp; Johnson extended the review period for its planned $1.8 billion acquisition of the company.</p>
        <p>Safety First, which projected a fourth-quarter loss, dropped 4 1/8, to 15 1/8. And Ventritex declined 2, to 18 3/4, after J. P. Morgan Securites projected a loss for the company of $1.80 a share in the fiscal year ending next June.</p>
