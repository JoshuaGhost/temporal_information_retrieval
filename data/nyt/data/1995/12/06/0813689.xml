        <p>Members of a House-Senate conference committee retreated today from plans to  eliminate cable television rate regulations, agreeing to keep current rules in place for three more years.</p>
        <p>The decision, reached in back-room negotiations before the lawmakers meet in  a public session on Wednesday, marks a big concession to Democratic lawmakers. It means that cable customers will avoid what would have been virtually certain  increases in cable rates under bills passed by the House and Senate last summer.</p>
        <p>The concession by Republican lawmakers is likely to resolve one of several bitter disputes with Democrats and the Clinton Administration over a sweeping bill to deregulate the communications industry. But the proposed compromise also contains contain a provision that could make it much easier for entrenched cable companies to fend off aspiring rivals and could still provoke objections from critics of the cable industry.</p>
        <p>The Senate's version of the telecommunications bill would have immediately ended most price regulations for all but a bare-bones tier of cable television service. The House passed a bill that would have eliminated the price restraints 15 months after passage.</p>
        <p>The Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America have predicted that cable prices will jump as much as $5 a month or 20 percent on average if they are deregulated because most cable systems still enjoy virtual monopolies in their local markets. Cable prices declined about $3 billion over all after they were regulated in 1994, although the drop varied considerably for individual systems. They began to creep up again this year as Federal regulators eased some of their rules.</p>
        <p>The cable television industry is not fighting the new compromise, in part because it wants the bill to pass and because it persuaded the Senate to abandon a provision that would have penalized companies considered to be "bad actors" on prices.</p>
        <p>Today's deal marked the most serious bargain so far as lawmakers rush to hammer out a comprehensive telecommunications bill that can pass Congress before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The broad purpose of the legislation is to knock down regulations that currently divide the communications industry into separate and protected fiefs for local telephone, cable television and long-distance telephone service. The House and Senate passed different but broadly similar bills by a wide margin last summer, and the two chambers are now trying to reconcile their differences  and also avoid a Presidential veto.</p>
        <p>But the deregulation of cable television rates was only one of several provisions in the legislation that drew veto threats.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration has strongly objected to provisions that greatly increase the number of radio and television stations a single company can own, and in particular to a provision in the House bill that lifts restrictions against local media concentration.</p>
        <p>The White House also objects to provisions that make it easier for the regional Bell companies to enter the long-distance market.</p>
        <p>For weeks, industry lobbyists and lawmakers have been predicting a bargain on cable regulation.</p>
        <p>Although executives in the cable television industry refused to comment publicly on the cable rate deal tonight, they had long said privately that their top priorities had been to get rules that let them enter the local telephone business and that give them greater certainty about the expiration of rate regulation.</p>
        <p>Cable industry executives said the compromise would give them greater certainty, because it would remove a crucial provision in the Senate bill that could have dogged them for years.</p>
        <p>Under that "bad actor" provision, the Federal Communications Commission would have been able to take action against cable operators that charged prices "substantially in excess of the national average" for prices as of last June.</p>
