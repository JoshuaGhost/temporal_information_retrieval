        <p>Representative Walter R. Tucker 3d today was convicted of extortion and tax evasion, having failed to convince a jury that he was a victim of Government prosecutors who he said were bent on imprisoning black officeholders like himself.</p>
        <p>Asked by reporters immediately afterward whether he would resign from Congress, Mr. Tucker, a 38-year-old second-term Democrat from nearby Compton, replied: "Yes. I will not put the Congress through that."</p>
        <p>The verdicts were returned in Federal District Court here, where the jurors, having deliberated for nine days, found Mr. Tucker guilty of seven counts of extortion, deadlocked on three other extortion counts and convicted him on two counts of tax evasion.</p>
        <p>He faces up to 146 years in prison and fines of as much as $1.95 million at his sentencing, scheduled for March 18. His lawyer, Robert Ramsey Jr., said they had not decided whether to appeal the verdicts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tucker was indicted last year on charges of having taken $37,500 in bribes while Mayor of Compton in 1991 and 1992, and having demanded an additional $250,000, from two companies that did business with the city. The indictment also accused him of having failed to declare $58,000 of his income.</p>
        <p>In his defense, Mr. Tucker maintained that he had accepted the money only as  consulting fees or as loans and that he had not declared the $58,000 on his personal tax returns because it had gone to his political campaign.</p>
        <p>He accused Federal prosecutors of an effort to bring down black politicians,  and said after the verdicts today: "The Government knows what happened. It was entrapment, and I hope that in time these kinds of exploits will not be executed on innocent people."</p>
        <p>Mr. Tucker is the 70th member of Congress to be indicted while in office, according to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based research organization. Six have been black, and three of those  -- Charles Diggs of Michigan, Mel Reynolds of Illinois and now Mr. Tucker -- were convicted. The three others were either acquitted or set free after jury deadlocks.</p>
