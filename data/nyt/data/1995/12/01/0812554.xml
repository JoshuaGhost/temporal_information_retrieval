        <p>Shares of British Biotech P.L.C. soared 88 percent yesterday after the company said an interim look at early clinical results suggested that its drug might inhibit the growth of cancerous tumors.</p>
        <p>The stock price almost tripled during the day, its American depository receipts reaching a high of $105.125, before falling $38 to close at $67, up $31.50, in Nasdaq trading.</p>
        <p>Edmund Debler, an analyst for Mehta &amp; Isaly, said the company had made public "interesting data, but not enough to cause all this commotion."</p>
        <p>During a conference call to discuss its midyear financial results, the company disclosed that an interim look at how its drug Marimastat was acting against various cancers showed some benefit. According to reports, the drug appeared to inhibit growth in four types of cancers and reduced the tumor in some cases.</p>
        <p>The idea behind the drug is to inhibit a tumor's ability to connect with a host body's circulatory system. The parasitic tumor needs to feed off the host,  or it dies.</p>
        <p>Officials at British Biotech could not be immediately reached for questions and comment later yesterday.</p>
