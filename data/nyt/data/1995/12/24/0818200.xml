        <p>We, too, read "Arts Cut at Old Westbury Revives a Battle" [Dec. 3] and the response by the president, Dr. L. Eudora Pettigrew [Letters, Dec. 10]. Although  she accuses you of not making "the effort to interview the administration," in her own letter Dr. Pettigrew gives evidence to support that you did make the effort to interview the administration and did give Dr. Pettigrew and her administration opportunities both for input and response -- a visit and at least two phone calls. Dr. Pettigrew says, "The reporter had called me at least twice  to respond to the allegations contained in the article."</p>

        <p>We, too, read "Arts Cut at Old Westbury Revives a Battle" [Dec. 3] and the response by the president, Dr. L. Eudora Pettigrew [Letters, Dec. 10]. Although  she accuses you of not making "the effort to interview the administration," in her own letter Dr. Pettigrew gives evidence to support that you did make the effort to interview the administration and did give Dr. Pettigrew and her administration opportunities both for input and response -- a visit and at least two phone calls. Dr. Pettigrew says, "The reporter had called me at least twice  to respond to the allegations contained in the article."</p>
        <p>Additional inconsistencies can be found in Dr. Pettigrew's letter.</p>
        <p>*The retrenchment of the American Music Dance and Theater Program is part of the 1996-97 operational budget, not the 1995-96 budget.  However the notification of retrenchments for that program and for the French certificate were implemented nearly three months before the appearance of any list of proposed program cuts by SUNY central or the board of trustees.</p>
        <p>*The Faculty Strategic Planning Committee submitted a proposal to save far more than the $350,000 in retrench personnel salaries without the loss of any faculty or programs.</p>
        <p>*The very same American Music Dance and Theater Program, then performing arts, was retrenched in 1992-93 and subsequently reinstated, after a student sit-in. The program was not allowed to recruit majors from 1992-94. Low enrollment statistics were then used in 1995 to justify retrenchment.</p>
        <p>*The "savings" accrued from firing eight tenured faculty and professional staff are not real savings. Administration spokespersons, including the academic vice president, have acknowledged that the eight lines will be reallocated on campus, not returned for savings.</p>
        <p>*The retrenched programs serve more than the 20 students cited in Dr. Pettigrew's letter. Many courses from American Music Dance and Theater are part  of the General Education curriculum required of all students.</p>
        <p>*The Maguire Theater, operated by the retrenched professionals, serves not only Old Westbury students, staff, administrators and faculty, but is a facility also used by the Long Island community.</p>
        <p>*The retrenched French certificate in the Modern Languages Program leaves that program with only one language, Spanish. In that action, the president fired a tenured faculty member who was hired to teach Spanish culture and history, as well as language. She is also the only faculty member certified to supervise student teachers in Spanish for teacher education.</p>
        <p>*While Dr. Pettigrew disagrees with the figure for general administrative costs, it is a fact that from 1992-95 the total increase in 21 of the 30 management confidential salaries was $187,589.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly Dr. Pettigrew makes no mention of the effect of her actions  on students at the college. It is ultimately students who suffer from the loss of faculty and staff, particularly at Old Westbury. The college has the highest student-faculty ratio in the state, 42 percent higher than the SUNY average. It also has the lowest library allocation per full-time equivalent student, and with overall library funding 18 percent below average.</p>
        <p>With fewer than 1.2 percent of faculty lines in SUNY, Old Westbury experienced almost 10 percent of the initial 87 SUNY-wide retrenchments.</p>
        <p>We would have hoped that the president of an institution such as ours would have fought retrenching any program or person, would regret any loss and would argue forcefully in all arenas for additional resources. Dr. Pettigrew's response to your article does not meet those expectations.</p>
