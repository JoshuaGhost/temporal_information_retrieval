        <p>With four days left before parliamentary elections here, the Russian Government's political leadership is spending much of its time trying not to panic -- and the rest of the time reminding voters that Communism was, is and always will be bad.</p>
        <p>At a news conference today, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin acknowledged that the Communists would prevail on Sunday. But he added that even if they did, his Government would continue its policies of reform.</p>
        <p>Speaking regretfully, Mr. Chernomyrdin, who leads the Government-backed party Our Home Is Russia, said he was sure of the "common sense of the Russian people." But he admitted he was sad that reform groups with similar platforms were unable to unite behind a single banner and said Russia's hopelessly divided democrats "just don't have much luck with leaders, you see -- each regards himself as a star."</p>
        <p>The split among liberals was underscored this afternoon when Yelena Bonner, a human rights activist and the widow of the Nobel Laureate Andrei Sakharov, released a letter she had written to several reform blocs begging them to withdraw.</p>
        <p>"I don't have any doubts that in participating in the election, you were guided by principled motives," she wrote to the leaders of several minor parties that are widely expected only to siphon votes from more viable groups. But, she  continued, "you are confusing the democratically oriented voters and you are making the victory of Communist and nationalist forces much easier."</p>
        <p>In order to take a role in Parliament, a party must receive at least 5 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>Our Home Is Russia was supposed to be the antidote to all this confusion. Led by the solid, reliable, defiantly uncharismatic Mr. Chernomyrdin, the party was  supposed to gobble up the vast unclaimed terrain between hard-line rightists and misty-eyed liberals. It seemed that President Boris N. Yeltsin had come up with  a desperately needed scheme to save the faltering reforms.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the reformers, however, to run this country these days you  have to win elections, and Mr. Chernomyrdin's camp has almost given up on that.</p>
        <p>Party leaders now admit that beating other reform groups, particularly Yabloko, led by Grigory Yavlinsky, is their main goal. Party leaders have openly cautioned supporters of other liberal groups that they may be throwing their votes away if they vote for the wrong people -- particularly Russia's Choice, the party led by the liberal Yegor T. Gaidar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin has found himself with all the problems of incumbency, but not all the powers. He is completely tied to Mr. Yeltsin in the public mind, and since Mr. Yeltsin's popularity is abysmal, the link does Mr. Chernomyrdin no good.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin can point to several achievements: The economy is functioning. Laws are slowly taking hold, and despite many setbacks, so is industrial reform.</p>
        <p>That does not appear to impress the voters. To them he is Yeltsin's man, far  more stable perhaps, but lacking in charm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chernomyrdin has raced around the country in the past few weeks, granting salary increases to miners, promising pensioners huge financial benefits and announcing an enormous program to rescue the millions of people who have been bilked by shady investment schemes.</p>
        <p>But those who can dispense the favors of government must also bear its burdens. And one of the biggest is the Government's long, apparently futile war  in Chechnya, the secessionist southern republic.</p>
        <p>By most accounts, Mr. Chernomyrdin was an early and strong opponent of the war. But when the Chechen separatist leader, Gen. Dzhokhar M. Dudayev, announced today that the war there will never end until the Kremlin has new leaders, the Prime Minister could not claim an exemption.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dudayev has been outraged by the Government's decision to hold elections  in Chechnya along with the rest of the country. "We have nothing more to lose,"  he said. "We intend to pursue the war until Russia is destroyed."</p>
        <p>That is unlikely, but perhaps destroying the future of current Russian leaders is not.</p>
        <p>If Our Home Is Russia has had trouble appealing to other reform groups, it has had no success at all among the nationalists who the party once hoped might  prefer stability to the unknown.</p>
        <p>"In our democratic state there can be no honest elections," said Aleksandr Lebed, a former general whose Congress of Russian Communities is expected to win enough votes to enter parliament. He said he expected the Kremlin to rig the vote, reminded people that crime has risen rapidly in the past three years, and  said that after the election, he would seek a referendum on reform.</p>
