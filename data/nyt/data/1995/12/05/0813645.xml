        <p>A sobbing and apologetic Patrick Roy said today that there was no chance of reconciliation with the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
        <p>"I really wanted it to end differently -- not in a stupid way like this," the 30-year-old goaltender said at a news conference at a suburban hotel.</p>
        <p>Roy, a three-time Vezina Trophy winner as the National Hockey League's top goaltender and the star player who led the Candiens to Stanley Cups in 1986 and  1993, was suspended with pay and placed on the trading market on Sunday.</p>
        <p>His four-year, $16 million contract may complicate plans for a trade, but Roy insisted he was still in top form.</p>
        <p>In his first extended account of his blowup with Coach Mario Tremblay during  an 11-1 loss to the Detroit Red Wings on Saturday night, Roy dashed speculation  he might still make up with the Canadiens.</p>
        <p>"Maybe in the short term it was possible, but in the long term, the same situation would have come up again," he said. Roy said the split resulted solely from his being yanked at 11 minutes 57 seconds of the second period after allowing 9 goals on 26 shots.</p>
