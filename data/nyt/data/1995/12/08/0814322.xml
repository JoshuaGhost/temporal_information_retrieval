        <p>Littlewoods Organization P.L.C., a British retailer, catalogue company and football pools operator, said yesterday that its shareholders had voted against  putting Britain's largest privately held company up for sale.  At an extraordinary meeting, shareholders rejected by an "overwhelming majority" a sale and resolutions that would have forced the board of the company to release  financial information to any serious bidder.</p>
        <p>The result rejects two public bids. N. Brown Group P.L.C. and Iceland Group  P.L.C. announced a joint bid of L1.1 billion ($1.69 billion) earlier this week,  while the company's ousted chief executive, Barry Dale, led an approach last August. Liverpool-based Littlewoods is owned by 32 descendants of Sir John Moores, who founded the company in 1923.</p>
