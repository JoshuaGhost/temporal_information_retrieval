        <p>At the opening hearing of what could be the last Nazi war crimes trial in Europe, families of the victims of a 1944 massacre in a cave outside Rome asked  today to be allowed to interrogate a former SS officer who took part in the executions.</p>
        <p>The trial of Erich Priebke, a former SS captain extradited to Italy from Argentina last month, is expected to get under way early next year, after Italy's constitutional court rules on the request.</p>
        <p>The killing of 335 men and boys in the Ardeatine Caves south of Rome on March 24, 1944, was the worst wartime atrocity in Italy, and for relatives of the victims the coming trial is seen as a chance to force one of its authors to  confront his crime.</p>
        <p>"I want to ask him many things, but the most important is whether he sleeps at night, and whether he sees those faces in his dreams," said Ida de Marchi, whose husband, Raoul, a member of the Italian anti-Nazi resistance, was one of the victims.</p>
        <p>The massacre was ordered in reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers by Italian partisans.</p>
        <p>"The verdict is in some ways irrelevant, said Tullia Zevi, president of Italy's Jewish communities. "What do I care if Priebke ends up under house arrest, or in prison for life? What is important is the trial."</p>
        <p>Mr. Priebke, 82 years old, was living quietly in Argentina until 1993, when his identity was made public during an ABC News interview. In the interview, Mr. Priebke admitted that he had shot two victims himself, but insisted that he was  carrying out orders from his superior, Herbert Kappler, the Gestapo chief in Rome.</p>
        <p>"He killed to save his life," said Mr. Priebke's Argentine lawyer, Pedro Bianchi. "As a captain in the SS, he was forced to obey orders."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kappler was convicted of war crimes in Italy in 1948 and sentenced to life in prison. He was smuggled out of a hospital in 1977, but died six months later in Germany.</p>
        <p>The case against Mr. Priebke -- described as Mr. Kappler's right- hand man whose job included checking the victims' names against a list -- has caused a national examination of the 1944 tragedy.</p>
        <p>"The feelings among the relatives is very strong," said Mrs. Zevi. "Those feelings are cooking inside, and it burns, it still burns."</p>
