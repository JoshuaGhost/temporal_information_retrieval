        <p>Wednesday evening's performance of Tchaikovsky's "Queen of Spades" at the Metropolitan Opera introduced a new pair of leads, but the new Ghermann and Lisa were hardly untested. The Armenian tenor Gegam Grigorian, making his debut, and  the soprano Maria Guleghina are veterans of the Kirov Opera's production with the same conductor, Valery Gergiyev, including tour performances at the Met in 1992.</p>
        <p>During the Kirov visit, Mr. Grigorian also sang a memorable Dmitri in "Boris  Godunov." That normally thankless role ideally suited his dark, even-toned lyric tenor, with its reasonably free top and a distinctive intensity that is built into the flow of the line.</p>

        <p>Wednesday evening's performance of Tchaikovsky's "Queen of Spades" at the Metropolitan Opera introduced a new pair of leads, but the new Ghermann and Lisa were hardly untested. The Armenian tenor Gegam Grigorian, making his debut, and  the soprano Maria Guleghina are veterans of the Kirov Opera's production with the same conductor, Valery Gergiyev, including tour performances at the Met in 1992.</p>
        <p>During the Kirov visit, Mr. Grigorian also sang a memorable Dmitri in "Boris  Godunov." That normally thankless role ideally suited his dark, even-toned lyric tenor, with its reasonably free top and a distinctive intensity that is built into the flow of the line.</p>
        <p>Ghermann is a considerable stretch for a lyric tenor, but an unusually secure lower range makes the impersonation possible. While a lyric tenor cannot  ride Tchaikovsky's heavy orchestration or convey vocally the extremity of Ghermann's incipient craziness, it was a pleasure to hear the role so attractively sung. And Mr. Gregorian's characteristic concentration produced frequent haunting moments.</p>
        <p>Ms. Guleghina, who has sung Maddalena in "Chenier," Santuzza and Tosca since  her 1991 Met debut, produces a full, expressive sound with a fair amount of dynamic control. The winter canal scene of Act III sounded somewhat raw, but the seemingly favorable placement of the singers all the way downstage may not have  helped.</p>
        <p>Nikolai Putilin, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Birgitta Svenden remain effectively  cast as Tomsky, Yeletsky and Pauline, and Mr. Gergiyev remains in effectively weighty control.</p>
