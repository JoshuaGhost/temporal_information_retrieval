        <p>President Clinton announced today that he had approved the deployment of an advance party of American troops to Bosnia, and White House officials said some  would start arriving at a staging area in Hungary on Monday.</p>
        <p>As expected, the President approved a plan under which 700 communications and logistics specialists are to be deployed from bases in Germany. Most will go by  rail to Hungary and then by road. They will be based in Tuzla, in the northeast  of Bosnia.</p>
        <p>The President, who returned to Washington from Europe this afternoon, approved the plan on Saturday night in a telephone conversation with his national security adviser, Anthony Lake, as he flew from Germany to Madrid. He had been briefed on the plan in Germany.</p>
        <p>The advance contingent is to prepare the way for 20,000 American troops who will join with 40,000 troops from about 25 other countries, making up the full NATO peacekeeping contingent. The main body of American troops will not be sent  in until after the Bosnian peace treaty is signed, which is scheduled for Dec. 14 in Paris.</p>
        <p>At a news conference before he left Madrid today, Mr. Clinton said: "Our destiny in America is still linked to Europe. And what we're seeing in Bosnia is an affront to the conscience of human beings everywhere, right in the heart of Europe."</p>
        <p>Asked about opposition to the plan by some Bosnian Serb leaders, including Gen. Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serbs' military commander, Mr. Clinton said he was confident that the President of Serbia, Slobodan Milosevic, would "take the  appropriate steps" to honor the agreement.</p>
