        <p>Gemina S.p.A. said today that it had sued the Bankers Trust New York Corporation for losses at Gemina's publishing unit that the company contends were caused by risky derivative securities sold by Bankers Trust.</p>
        <p>Gemina filed a civil suit seeking compensation for losses at the publishing unit, RCS Editori, a Gemina spokeswoman, Noris Morano, said. She would not say how much the company was seeking in damages.</p>
        <p>Bankers Trust is negotiating with Gemina to settle the suit, said Thomas Parisi, a spokesman for the bank in New York. If a settlement cannot be reached, "we're confident we can prevail in court," Mr. Parisi said.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed here, comes a month after the Gemina publishing unit said it  expected to report a loss of 590 billion lire ($371 million) this year. Ten of Gemina's top executives are being investigated by public prosecutors in Milan over possible balance-sheet fraud relating to the losses, which forced the company to call off its plans to merge with Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A.</p>
