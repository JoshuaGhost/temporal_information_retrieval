        <p>These days performances of Handel's "Messiah" tend to fall into two camps: there are period-instrument ensembles and choruses that favor fleet tempos, crisp rhythms and light textures; and there are modern-instrument ensembles that value full-bodied choral sound and richer orchestral textures.</p>
        <p>Richard Westenburg's performance on Thursday night with Musica Sacra, the orchestra and chorus he has directed since its founding in 1968, combined the best aspects of both approaches. His work was informed by qualities that are prized in period-instrument groups. The orchestra playing was lithe, articulate  and rhythmically incisive. The modest-sized chorus (35 singers) kept the contrapuntal textures clear; yet the choral sound was resonant and unforced.</p>

        <p>These days performances of Handel's "Messiah" tend to fall into two camps: there are period-instrument ensembles and choruses that favor fleet tempos, crisp rhythms and light textures; and there are modern-instrument ensembles that value full-bodied choral sound and richer orchestral textures.</p>
        <p>Richard Westenburg's performance on Thursday night with Musica Sacra, the orchestra and chorus he has directed since its founding in 1968, combined the best aspects of both approaches. His work was informed by qualities that are prized in period-instrument groups. The orchestra playing was lithe, articulate  and rhythmically incisive. The modest-sized chorus (35 singers) kept the contrapuntal textures clear; yet the choral sound was resonant and unforced.</p>
        <p>At the same time, in the manner of modern-instrument interpretations going back to Thomas Beecham, Mr. Westenburg conducted a spacious, richly textured performance. Even the lilting choruses ("His yoke is easy," for one) allowed Handel's playful rhythms to sound and the words to speak. Only occasionally did  the performance become too serene. Mr. Westenburg kept the opening lines of the  chorus "For unto us a child is born" soft, as Handel indicated, and impressively light; but the choristers might have sounded a little more enthusiastic about the big news.</p>
        <p>The vocal soloists were mostly excellent, particularly the soprano Jeanne Ommerle. Her voice is a marvel: radiant, true and completely even from bottom to top. "I know that my Redeemer liveth" has been sung with more sweet innocence, but seldom with more beauty and telling phrasing. The elegant tenor Jon Humphrey sang with supple lyricism and textual clarity. Christina Wilcox has a naturally expressive mezzo-soprano sound, though her interpretation was sometimes wan. In "The trumpet shall sound," when the powerful bass Kevin McMillan prophesied that "we shall be changed," he made the prospect seem both thrilling and terrifying. Raymond Mase played the solo trumpet part in that aria brilliantly.</p>
