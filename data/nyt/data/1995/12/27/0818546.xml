        <p>At least 119 people died and many more were missing in floods caused by heavy rains in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal Province, the police said today.</p>
        <p>Police divers, rescue teams, residents and helicopters were pulling out bodies from the Umsunduze River and its tributary, the Slangspruit, which overflowed Monday night.</p>
        <p>A police spokesman, Henry Budrum, said that 119 bodies had been recovered so far.</p>
        <p>The victims all lived in Imbali, near Edendale, a black township outside Pietermaritzburg.</p>
        <p>"We are expecting to find many more overnight and tomorrow," Mr. Budrum said.</p>
        <p>The police and residents said that the water level had dropped and that the townships were no longer in danger unless heavy rain resumes.</p>
        <p>Residents scoured the riverbanks searching for relatives while a police helicopter airlifted body bags carrying victims.</p>
        <p>An Imbali resident, Enock Nhlangulela, said he had lost nine relatives in the floods.</p>
        <p>"I was lucky because I went to visit friends when the heavy rains came," he said.</p>
        <p>"When I returned I found everyone and everything inside the house had been washed away."</p>
        <p>A provincial legislator, Sifiso Nkabinde, said the regional government has declared Imbali township a disaster area.</p>
        <p>For many years Edendale and Imbali were the scene of bitter fighting between  supporters of President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>
        <p>Political violence has eased since elections in April last year ended white-minority rule. But on Monday at least 14 people were killed in a raid by Inkatha supporters on backers of the Congress in the Shobashobane settlement in  the area.</p>
