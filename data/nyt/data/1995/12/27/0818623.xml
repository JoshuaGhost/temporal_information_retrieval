        <p>Citing a losing record and the need to move forward quickly, the Arizona Cardinals' owner, Bill Bidwill, dismissed his pugnacious coach, Buddy Ryan, only a few hours after his team was beaten, 37-13, by Dallas in its last game of the  1995 season.</p>
        <p>After the game Ryan said he expected to return next season as coach and general manager. Ryan believed that he would survive for another season if he made some changes to his coaching staff.</p>
        <p>But Bidwill, who remained silent during the months of speculation about Ryan's job, had another idea. He dismissed Ryan after a short meeting with the coach at the team's headquarters in Phoenix yesterday morning. Bidwill said he actually did not make the decision to dismiss Ryan until earlier in the morning.</p>
        <p>"I've kept an open mind on the situation, and last night I started thinking about it and came to the conclusion this is the direction we should go," Bidwill said.</p>
        <p>Asked what the overwhelming reason for the dismissal was, Bidwill said: "The  record. The way the team was in sort of a tailspin."</p>
        <p>Ryan has declined comment after the latest twist in his saga, which included  conflicts at his last three stops before landing in Arizona.</p>
        <p>As the Bears' defensive coordinator, Ryan clashed with the head coach, Mike Ditka, during Chicago's Super Bowl season in 1985. He was the Eagles' head coach from 1986 to 1990, but alienated the team's owner, Norman Braman, who dismissed Ryan after the Eagles lost in the first round of the playoffs for the  third consecutive year. After a two-year absence from coaching, Ryan returned as the Houston Oilers' defensive coordinator and, in the middle of a 1993 game against the Jets, he punched the offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride in the jaw during a sideline dispute. He left after that season to take the head coaching job with the Cardinals.</p>
        <p>Although Ryan has been a brilliant defensive strategist, his tempestuous nature makes it difficult for him to work under another coach and his benign interest -- some would say neglect -- of the offense makes him ineffective as a  head coach. His failings in Arizona might have come because he had too much power.</p>
        <p>Bidwill wouldn't say whether he will hire two separate people to assume the jobs of coach and general manager. He said his search for a replacement hasn't yet begun, but he will look at college coaches and offensive/defensive coordinators already in the National Football League.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the loss to Dallas, Ryan said injuries to key players had contributed to the team's poor showing this season.</p>
        <p>Bidwill didn't buy it.</p>
        <p>"We considered that," he said. "But there were injuries on other teams also.  That's part of the game."</p>
        <p>Without results on the field, Ryan's abrasive style and bravado had begun to  wear on the fans in Phoenix and with Bidwill. When asked whether that style rubbed him the wrong way, Bidwill said no.</p>
        <p>Ryan's dismissal drew mixed reactions from the players. Fullback Larry Centers, an emotional player who was selected to his first Pro Bowl this season  and also set a league record for the most receptions by a running back in a season (101), said he wanted to be traded now that Ryan is out.</p>
        <p>Quarterback Dave Krieg, who led Detroit to the playoffs in 1994 and was Ryan's key free-agent acquisition on offense for 1995, was more philosophical.</p>
        <p>"When you're 4-12, something has to be done," Krieg said. "When I came here this was a much better team. How can you be 8-8 and turn around and go 4-12? The players have to take some responsibility as well, but it's very disappointing."</p>
        <p>Bidwill will have to buy out the remaining two years of Ryan's contract for $1.5 million. But the firing brought to an end two years of bluster that had begun when Ryan stormed into Phoenix and proclaimed: "You've got a winner in town."</p>
        <p>Ryan never made good on that promise, going 12-20. This year's team lost seven of its last eight games.</p>
        <p>When he took over from Joe Bugel in February 1994, Ryan inherited a team that hadn't made the playoffs since 1975, but was coming off a 7-9 season -- winning  four of its last five games -- and looked poised to make a run at the playoffs.  One of Ryan's first acts was to fire the offensive coordinator, Jerry Rhome, who is respected around the league and is now in the same position with the Oilers.  Then, in his capacity as general manager, Ryan loaded up on defensive free agents, giving big contracts to two of his former Eagles stars -- linebacker Seth Joyner and defensive tackle Clyde Simmons.</p>
        <p>The defense played well in Ryan's first season, finishing No. 3 in the league over all and the team went 8-8. But the offense sunk to the bottom of the league, while Ryan played quarterback roulette for most of the season. With carte blanche to go after any free-agent quarterback, Ryan signed Krieg, a 17-year veteran prone to turnovers.</p>
        <p>Krieg led the league in lost fumbles (15) and the offense remained at the bottom of the league -- 24th over all and 30th in rushing. The Cardinals' defense, Ryan's pride and joy, sank with it -- 21st over all and 30th against the run.</p>
