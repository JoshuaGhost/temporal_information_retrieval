        <p>FROM an economic vantage, 1995 was a year of mixed reviews for Westchester.</p>

        <p>FROM an economic vantage, 1995 was a year of mixed reviews for Westchester.</p>
        <p>Some, like Geoffrey Thompson, a partner in Thompson &amp; Bender, a marketing firm, saw it as a stellar 12 months. "Things were definitely on the uptick," Mr. Thompson said. "They're finally happening here."</p>
        <p>And so they were. Mastercard International moved to the county. International Business Machines decided to keep its headquarters in Armonk. A 2.5-million-square-foot upscale shopping mall, The Westchester, opened for business in White Plains. Retail development in the northern part of the county, if not booming, continued to gain momentum. The office vacancy rate, after a number of bad years, finally dropped. And real estate sales continued on a steady course.</p>
        <p>But not everyone evaluated 1995 from the same perspective.</p>
        <p>"Things are flat," said Thomas J. Spitznas, a Mount Vernon economist. "Very slow growth."</p>
        <p>That too was true.</p>
        <p>Firms continued to downsize, and job growth was sluggish. "People are scared," Mr. Spitznas said. "We may be looking at a recession next year."</p>
        <p>While both economic evaluations of the last year in Westchester were valid, clearly the balance sheet on businesses moving in and those moving out ended favorably, and much previously vacant office space was absorbed.</p>
        <p>William V. Cuddy, a senior vice president with the Rostenberg Doern Company,  a commercial real estate concern in Purchase, reported that all the corporate activity resulted in an office vacancy rate for the county that dropped to 18.7  percent this December from 22.3 percent at the end of 1994. In White Plains, the office-vacancy rate -- at 30.6 percent a year ago -- went down this year to 26 percent.</p>
        <p>"There's a sense of stability in the marketplace that we haven't seen for years," Mr. Cuddy said.</p>
        <p>In October, Mastercard, the country's second-largest credit card company, moved its world headquarters from Manhattan to Purchase along with 850 employees. In the process, the company bought 472,600 square feet from I.B.M. for its new office, and within two to five years, it is expected to employ another 450 workers.</p>
        <p>Not only did I.B.M. announce this year that it would stay in Armonk but it also said it would build a new $70 million headquarters there, contradicting earlier reports that it was considering moving out of the county.</p>
        <p>Also in 1995, Oxford Health Plans, a health maintenance organization based in Norwalk, agreed to lease 265,000 square feet in White Plains. Within a year, the move could account for 1,500 new jobs in the county.</p>
        <p>Ciba Corporation moved from Ardsley to Tarrytown, along with 900 workers, to  corporate space vacated by I.B.M. in 1993, allaying fears that it, too, was considering relocation elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Yet another corporate decision to stay in Westchester contributed to the growing sense of economic well-being as the year progressed. Mr. Thompson said "the tide seemed to turn" in August when Prodigy Services Company, the on-line company, said it would keep its corporate headquarters in White Plains, reversing a June announcement that it was going to move from Yorktown and White  Plains to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>"Prodigy's first announcement sent a tremor through the economic and political community here," Mr. Thompson said. "It would have opened up a huge block of real estate in the county and been a real psychological blow."</p>
        <p>Other corporate highlights for the year: Purdue Frederick, a pharmaceutical firm, said it would keep its research and development operations in Yonkers; Steiner Foods, a specialty foods and import company, moved to New Rochelle; Kawasaki Rail Car extended its lease in an industrial park in Yonkers until 2000.</p>
        <p>Not only did the corporate real estate market thrive in 1995 but also private sector real estate fared well. Sales may not have been as robust as the record-high postings of 1994, but the number of closings and the dollar volume were well ahead of 1993 totals. Stephen R. Meyers, executive vice president and  general manager of Houlihan Lawrence, a real estate concern with offices in Westchester and Putnam, said it appeared that the home market -- like the commercial sector -- had entered a period of stability.</p>
        <p>Third-quarter sales of single-family homes were at 1,508 -- down from 1,637 for the corresponding period in 1994 but up from 1,413 in the same period in 1993. Dollar volume was down to $1.3 million, from $1.5 million last year, but up from $1.1 million two years ago.</p>
        <p>"Conditions were favorable -- steady pricing, no big increases and very good  interest rates," said P. Gilbert Mercurio, executive vice president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service. He said that the number of sales in 1995 was the second-highest since 1980, when data were first tracked.</p>
        <p>Also on the plus side of the ledger for 1995 was the completion of a Federal  Court House in downtown White Plains, which is expected to encourage law firms in the county to expand their offices and encourage new ones to move in.</p>
        <p>Retail activity was also healthy. The Westchester mall opened with 80 stores  in March and counted 135 by year's end. In New Rochelle, an $80 million retail center has been proposed for the site of a failed mall. In Yorktown, plans were  unveiled to expand the Jefferson Valley Mall by 40 percent -- to add 230,000 square feet to the retail center and remodel the existing 580,000 square feet. Also in Yorktown, B. J.'s Wholesale Club, a big-box retailer, opened a 106,000-square-foot store. And in White Plains, the State Attorney General, Dennis Vacco, ruled that Macy's could keep its retail store there open, reversing an agreement in principle reached in 1994 to sell or close the store to resolve an antitrust action.</p>
        <p>In addition, the banking industry in the county showed healthy growth. William H. Dickinson, a vice president of middle markets for Westchester and other areas, reported that the volume of commercial loans in the county was up by 25 percent.</p>
        <p>But even with all the good news, serious problems in the economy persisted.</p>
        <p>"The momentum," Mr. Spitznas, the economist, said, "is less than it seems."</p>
        <p>He observed that I.B.M. not only continued to lay off workers but the computer giant also appeared to be in "a permanent downsizing mode." Also Nynex, which employs 7,200 people in Westchester, announced plans to cut up to 25 percent of its jobs in the state.</p>
        <p>As a result, workers in many companies were apprehensive.</p>
        <p>"People are taking smaller wage gains to save their jobs," Mr. Spitznas said. "The consumer may get too scared to spend."</p>
        <p>Also on the debit side of the ledger, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke announced plans to privatize some county services and slash 800 jobs to save taxpayers $50 million in 1996. As of late October, 415 county employees had accepted retirement incentives and 300 had been furloughed. More cuts are to come.</p>
        <p>Frank M. Surdey, an economist with the State Department of Labor, said job growth, although moderate, was "not robust by any means."</p>
        <p>The largest job losses were seen in communication-machine and computer-equipment manufacturing, special trade contractors, business services,  wholesale trade and durable goods, general merchandise stores, food products, manufacturing and depository institutions.</p>
        <p>The largest employment gains were seen in health and social services, local and suburban transit, educational services and nondepository credit institutions.</p>
        <p>"When we average the highs and the lows, we come up with moderate job growth," Mr. Surdey said. "Not real healthy, but some positive developments."</p>
        <p>Unemployment rates were low, with the latest figures available showing October at 4.3 percent, the lowest for the month since 1990. But few economists  paid much heed to those figures, because as Mr. Surdey explained it, the rate only measures those seeking employment and fails to account for those who have given up the search.</p>
        <p>Construction workers had a difficult year, and Ross J. Pepe, president of the Construction Industry Council of Westchester and the Hudson Valley, said unemployment in the trades reached 25 percent. The main reason for the difficulties in 1995 stemmed from delays and cancellations of projects and cuts  in the capital budget for the State Department of Transportation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pepe, whose organization represents 500 trade groups, and Lawrence E. Dwyer, president of the Westchester County Association, a business group, said new emphasis on business initiatives from the Pataki Administration were expected to spur economic development in 1996 and resolve some of the problems that dogged the economy in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitznas said that while some of the same economic problems were being reported in parts of the country, others were peculiar to Westchester.</p>
        <p>In particular, the high cost of living in the county exacerbated many of the  difficulties for workers. Mr. Spitznas said that "$94,000 a year gets you in the top tax bracket for the state, but that's not much in Westchester." The middle class here, he said, "is taking a beating."</p>
