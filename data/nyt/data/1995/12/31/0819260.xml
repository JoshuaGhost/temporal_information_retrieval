        <p>A comparatively obscure psychiatrist in Sacramento, Calif., Thomas A. Harris  became a dysfunctional household name when his book was translated into 25 languages ("Ich Bin O.K. -- Du Bist O.K.") and earned a then-record $1 million for paperback rights in 1972. Though the fickle self-help audience eventually moved on to Peter Pan complexes and women who love too much -- and Harris was often confused with the Thomas Harris who wrote "Silence of the Lambs" -- the doctor's influence continues to be felt. Among his more lasting achievements:</p>
        <p>PSYCHOBABBLE: One of the goals of transactional analysis (originally formulated by Eric Berne, who had his own best seller with "Games People Play")  was to make psychotherapy more user friendly by developing, as Harris put it, "a precision vocabulary, which anyone could understand." A laudable aim, but it resulted in sentences like "Another person's script may call for behavior which  is provoking to the point where others turn on him (negative stroking), thus proving once again, I'M NOT O.K." Coming at the beginning of the 1970's, a decade already prone to wooly language and self-absorption, this sort of talk was catnip, leading to two decades worth of increasingly baroque ways of saying, "I don't like myself." Today, even the least touchy-feely among us -- Warren Christopher, say -- can use terms like "co-dependency" and "gender confusion" in casual conversation. (A tip for the Secretary of State: Radovan Karadzic, NOT O.K.)</p>
        <p>ROBIN WILLIAMS'S CAREER: A basic tenet of transactional analysis is that the  mind is divided into three components, Parent, Adult and Child, which vaguely correspond to the superego, ego and id of traditional analysis. Harris's conception that "in the Child reside creativity, curiosity . . . the recordings  of the glorious, pristine feelings of first discoveries" would seem a direct antecedent of the more recent "inner child," which Hollywood has indulged in the feel-good movies of Robin Williams. Could Williams have made a career out of playing holy fools and elfin dads in a world without "I'm O.K. -- You're O.K."?  It is hard to imagine -- just as it is hard to imagine Leni Riefenstahl's feel-good movies without "Mein Kampf."</p>
        <p>PATRICK EWING MISSING THAT FINGER-ROLL SHOT IN THE PLAY-OFFS LAST YEAR: I can't really blame Harris for this. I just want to because even though I read his book, I'm still NOT O.K., so I'm acting out.</p>
