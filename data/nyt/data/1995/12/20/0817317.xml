        <p>Despite the alarmist cries in the West over the outcome of Russia's election  on Sunday, the overall balance in Parliament between the Communists and nationalists, on one hand, and the broad reformist middle, on the other, will not change.</p>
        <p>In fact, the election was a virtual replay of the voting in 1993. The only shifts have taken place within -- not between -- the two broad camps of voters.  The electorate may be deeply polarized between the opponents and supporters of the current course of reform, but it has remained extremely stable in its sentiments. And, in a victory for democracy, more than 60 percent of the electorate voted, more than all the polls predicted.</p>
        <p>It is true that the Communist Party doubled its share of the popular vote compared with 1993. But its victory came at the expense of its rural ally, the Agrarian Party, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic  Party. The Agrarians did so poorly they did not reach the 5 percent threshold needed to win seats. Mr. Zhirinovsky won only 11 percent of the popular vote --  less than half of the 23 percent he took in 1993. In places where he did well in 1993, the Communists have improved while his party faltered. In 1993, these two  parties and the Agrarians together took 44 percent of the vote. On Sunday, they  won 38 percent -- hardly a smashing victory.</p>
        <p>The same stability of voter attitudes was found on the reformist side, but these voters split their votes among more parties this time. In 1993, they won 29 percent of the popular vote. On Sunday, the reformists, led by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's Our Home Is Russia, Yabloko and Russia's Choice together collected 21 percent.</p>
        <p>Several smaller parties from the reformists' side rejected calls for unity and ran independent campaigns. While none came close to the 5 percent threshold, the grouping won more than 7 percent of the popular vote. If its votes are counted as part of the sum cast for reformism, the total is exactly the same as  in 1993.</p>
        <p>The popular vote for party lists determines only half of the 450 seats in Parliament. The other half is determined by candidates who run in local districts and, here again, the overall balance of seats will not change significantly from 1993.</p>
        <p>In big cities, where free-market reforms and privatization have progressed the furthest, the reformist parties do well. In the countryside, where such changes have been slower, the Communists and extreme nationalists win.</p>
        <p>The polarization in the electorate suggests that the reformists cannot afford to be divided during the two-stage presidential balloting in June. A Communist will undoubtedly be one of the two top vote-getters in the first ballot. Whether he faces Mr. Zhirinovsky or a reformist candidate in the final vote depends on whether the reform movement can unify behind one candidate.</p>
