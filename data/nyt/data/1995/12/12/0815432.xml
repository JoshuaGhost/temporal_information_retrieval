        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to break up the Long Island Lighting Company and cut electric rates on the Island by 12 percent drew criticism at a public hearing last night, particularly from workers at the utility concerned about the fate of the company.</p>
        <p>Under the Pataki plan, Lilco would sell its gas business and power plants to  private companies, and the Long Island Power Authority would buy the Lilco transmission and distribution system. The state would issue more than $4.5 billion in tax-free bonds so it could pay its debt on the defunct Shoreham nuclear plant.</p>

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's plan to break up the Long Island Lighting Company and cut electric rates on the Island by 12 percent drew criticism at a public hearing last night, particularly from workers at the utility concerned about the fate of the company.</p>
        <p>Under the Pataki plan, Lilco would sell its gas business and power plants to  private companies, and the Long Island Power Authority would buy the Lilco transmission and distribution system. The state would issue more than $4.5 billion in tax-free bonds so it could pay its debt on the defunct Shoreham nuclear plant.</p>
        <p>At the hearing, the audience applauded when a Lilco gas worker talked about  the need to maintain reliability if the gas system was sold. When he likened Lilco workers to a family, he drew more applause.</p>
        <p>In an effort to assure the employees that the plan would protect them, James  F. Gill, the chairman of the Long Island Power Authority, said, "I'm not the enemy."</p>
        <p>Joseph W. McDonald, a vice president of Lilco, said the company would not to  take a position on the plan tonight.</p>
        <p>"We are waiting to get more information from LIPA so we can evaluate their proposal," he said. "We need to have the assumptions they used so we can see if  this plan achieves the Governor's objectives."</p>
        <p>Earlier today, the Nassau County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, endorsed the plan.</p>
        <p>"Compared with previous proposals, this is, by far, our best chance of experiencing real rate cuts in the future, and removing Lilco's choke hold on local residents and business," Mr. Gulotta said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said that the Pataki plan made it clear that Nassau residents would be compensated for the overassessment of the former Shoreham nuclear plant by Suffolk County. Mr. Kessel's plan called for forgiving the Suffolk debt.</p>
        <p>Suffolk owes Lilco $83 million for the overassessment, and faces an additional payment of more than $400 million in a pending case.</p>
        <p>The Suffolk County Executive, Robert J. Gaffney, is still reviewing the plan, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gulotta said the plan would protect Lilco employees by assuring them jobs with Lilco's successors. But at news conference today, leaders of two electrical workers union locals representing 3,600 Lilco employees attacked the plan, saying that it does not protect jobs and will damage Long Island's economy.</p>
