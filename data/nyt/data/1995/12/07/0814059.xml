        <p>The lawyer for a Camden County man committed to a state mental hospital after being found not guilty of a sex offense by reason of insanity urged an appeals court yesterday to overturn a law that forbids such people from living in supervised community group homes.</p>
        <p>James Katz, a volunteer lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said  that his client, described only as "J.W.," was no longer under court supervision for the 1981 case and that his doctor had said he belonged in a group home. But  State Superior Court Judge E. Stevenson Fluharty ruled that state law prevented  the man from ever being assigned to a group home. J.W. has been living in Ancora Psychiatric Hospital in Winslow Township, the A.P. reported.</p>
