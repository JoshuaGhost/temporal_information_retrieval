        <p>The 76-year-old Prime Minister has been in intensive care for a month after being hospitalized with pneumonia. Most of the time, he has been on a respirator and kidney machine, but in the last few days he had been breathing on his own.</p>
        <p>In the last 12 hours, the Prime Minister's condition worsened," the Onassis  Cardiac Surgery Center said. "His breathing is being supported by a respirator continually."</p>
        <p>Laboratory tests had not yet confirmed doctors' suspicions that Mr. Papandreou was suffering from a new infection.</p>
