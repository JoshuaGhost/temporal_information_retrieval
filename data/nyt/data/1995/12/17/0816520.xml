        <p>McDonald's wants to open a 24-hour drive-through franchise in Boerum Hill, on the southeast corner of Atlantic and Third Avenues. The idea is unpopular with many local residents -- but in the course of fighting it last week, they turned  a municipal hearing into a forum on the very nature of Boerum Hill.</p>
        <p>"What is the essential character of this neighborhood?" asked Joseph Mohbat,  president of the East Pacific Street Block Association, at the hearing before the Board of Standards and Appeals. "It is urban, it is pedestrian and it is storefront. The McDonald's model that is before us is a suburban model. It would be better on Northern Boulevard or Staten Island."</p>

        <p>McDonald's wants to open a 24-hour drive-through franchise in Boerum Hill, on the southeast corner of Atlantic and Third Avenues. The idea is unpopular with many local residents -- but in the course of fighting it last week, they turned  a municipal hearing into a forum on the very nature of Boerum Hill.</p>
        <p>"What is the essential character of this neighborhood?" asked Joseph Mohbat,  president of the East Pacific Street Block Association, at the hearing before the Board of Standards and Appeals. "It is urban, it is pedestrian and it is storefront. The McDonald's model that is before us is a suburban model. It would be better on Northern Boulevard or Staten Island."</p>
        <p>The site McDonald's wants is in a special Atlantic Avenue zoning district created 23 years ago to preserve the look and feel of a neighborhood of storefronts and three- and four-story attached buildings, most built in the 1800's. Zoning rules govern everything from the colors of cornices and lintels to the glass used in transoms over doors.</p>
        <p>Fast-food restaurants are allowed in the district, but McDonald's needs zoning waivers to build a drive-through. When its representatives went before the Board of Standards and Appeals Tuesday to ask permission, they were met by 30 Boerum Hill residents who said the project would destroy the character of an  area they'd spent decades working to improve.</p>
        <p>Some said that character was molded by the Civil War when supplies were sent  from the Brooklyn waterfront to troops farther South.  "Many buildings along Atlantic Avenue and in Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill are the architectural heritage of this prosperous era," said Jerome C. Haggerty, president of the Atlantic Avenue Local Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>The special zoning rules call for "limited automotive service uses" on Atlantic Avenue. But as it stretches from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway clear through to the Interboro Parkway, the avenue becomes a heavily trafficked thoroughfare. The stretch west of Flatbush Avenue has preserved its 19th century feel, but the east side is somewhat industrial, with drive-through restaurants,  gas stations and garages.</p>
        <p>Bill Harris, a property-owner who testified for the Boerum Hill Association,  said that a drive-through would worsen the already bad traffic jams at the intersection of Atlantic, Flatbush and Fourth Avenues. "Regarding traffic," he said, "we find the concept of a drive-in service so flawed as to be ridiculous."</p>
        <p>Marvin B. Mitzner, a lawyer representing the McDonald's Corporation, said that a traffic study commissioned by McDonald's found that the drive-through "will not create a back-up situation."</p>
        <p>No decision was made, and the hearing is to continue on Feb. 6.</p>
        <p>Not all the Boerum Hill speakers were against Big Macs. Richard Beckford testified: "I love McDonald's hamburgers, although at times my wife tries to keep me from eating them. But I already have three places I can go within a five-minute walk from my house."</p>
