        <p>ONCE again, American guns, carried by American soldiers, are heading into a distant fray, their reception in Bosnia at best uncertain. Memories of Somalia and, still, Vietnam, haunt every military venture overseas.</p>
        <p>American butter, spread by American corporations investing abroad at a record pace, has meanwhile never been so widely welcomed. Although United States battleships and B-52's have in many places overstayed their welcome, Boeings filled with business executives and Commerce Department aides can land almost anywhere, even at Noi Bai Airport in Hanoi.</p>
        <p>The new spirit has spread so thoroughly and rapidly, but with so little comment, that it's easy to forget how recently the United States was seen as an  economic Godzilla. Nobody talks about Coca-Colonization anymore -- "Coke welcomes you to Hanoi," say a pair of signs in the shape of giant bottles bracketing the airport highway -- and seldom are Yankees bearing briefcases told to go home.</p>
        <p>More Jobs at Home</p>
        <p>As most economists agree, direct foreign investment, as distinct from portfolio investment in stocks and bonds, generally raises demand for American goods and services and creates jobs and wealth back home. Although some foreign  spending has shifted jobs abroad, most goes to penetrate overseas markets.</p>
        <p>In the first nine months of this year, American direct investment abroad was  running at a record $74 billion annual rate, more than double the 1992 pace. By  now, the world's thirst for American investment is taken for granted, so much so that exceptions seem downright quaint.</p>
        <p>When noisy Indian nationalists recently halted construction of a $3 billion American power plant and health inspectors shut New Delhi's first Kentucky Fried Chicken, nobody in other countries applauded. Even many Indians snickered. "The  Tale of Two Flies," they called the Kentucky Fried Chicken case, noting that by  local standards, a restaurant with so few deserved to be celebrated, not punished.</p>
        <p>The rest of the world is competing for American capital, to finance factories, public works, telecommunications, technology transfers and jobs. This nation's capitalists are eager to oblige, and not just in countries recuperating from Communism or rambunctious self-reliance.</p>
        <p>American products and culture are the rage everywhere. In Japan, consumers allied themselves with the United States Government in pressing officials to open markets. More and more Japanese are learning to eat at McDonald's, shop at  Toys 'R' Us and strike sullen, slouching poses in clothing from the first two Gaps, which opened in September.</p>
        <p>Western Europe -- which American executives, policymakers and journalists were calling Fortress Europe just a few years ago -- has absorbed by far the most American capital and the greatest absolute increases. Even the largest funeral home chains in France and England have been bought by a Houston-based company determined to sell Europeans the flashy, overengineered coffins that Americans crave. Mon Dieu!</p>
        <p>And to think of all the trouble the world's revolutionaries and intellectuals took to paint foreign investment in general, American in particular, as colonialism in another ravenous form. Back when banana republics weren't just outfitters for expeditions to shopping mall food courts, they often handed over  their natural resources on foreigners' terms. Lenin's description of foreign investment as economic imperialism captured and colored the outlooks of many emerging nations.</p>
        <p>Europeans, guided by the likes of Charles de Gaulle, resisted American investment on cultural and political as well as economic grounds. "The Common Market has become a new Far West for American businessmen," the French journalist Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber wrote in "The American Challenge," published in 1968. "Their investments do not so much involve a transfer of capital as an actual seizure of power."</p>
        <p>French and British universities provided a link to leaders and intellectuals  in the developing world, steeping them in socialism and anti-Americanism while American universities provided technical skills.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, however, foreign investment was flowing so strongly into the United States that many Americans themselves went nationalist. First they feared the flood of Arab petrodollars. Then they were vexed by Japan's superyen, which  bought up the Pebble Beach golf course, Hollywood studios and even Rockefeller Center. Americans demanded barriers, even though the prices were so crazed that  the slogan among many deal makers became, "I have met the greater fool, and he speaks Japanese."</p>
        <p>Japan's Retreat</p>
        <p>The Japanese are still taking their losses, the Europeans just starting to make many of their American acquisitions profitable. And the United States has supplanted a retreating Japan as the major font of foreign investment. No other  country has capitalized so well on the political and philosophical turns of the  late 1980's.</p>
        <p>In China, Bill Gates can do what Warren Christopher often can't, which is to  receive a warm smile and hearty clasp from President Jiang Zemin (followed by a  decree making Windows the nation's software standard). In Vietnam, where the United States lifted an embargo on trade and investment last year, Coca-Cola is  already opening its first bottling plant, Mobil is exploring for oil, Caterpillar is leasing equipment and Otis Elevator is busy with installations in new buildings.</p>
        <p>But the failure of socialism and the ebbing of fears dating to the colonial era only go part way toward explaining America's new popularity. Many countries  are adopting American corporations (calling them multinational has become redundant) as their industrial models.  Asian executives go for business training at Stanford, Latin Americans favor the Ivy League and M.I.T., and British and French universities teach American management skills.</p>
        <p>Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, recently wrote in Die Welt, Germany's leading newspaper, that English should become Europe's second language. Some diplomats protested, he said, but scientists and business people  have already made English their universal tongue. These include even the French, he added, "which was impossible to imagine 10 or 15 years ago." Mr. Walter is also on the board of The English Theater in Frankfurt, which recently presented the shamelessly American "Tony 'n' Tina's Wedding."</p>
        <p>Not that the surge in investment always benefits both sides of the deal. American companies sell drugs abroad that fail safety tests here, foul the environment and deal with apparel contractors who use child labor.</p>
        <p>Among American workers, tens, probably hundreds of thousands have watched their automobile, apparel and electronics jobs moved to Latin America and Asia.  Companies are even farming out software writing to India.</p>
        <p>Still Targets</p>
        <p>Instead of raising the alarm about foreigners investing in the United States, politicians now search for scapegoats among countries where America itself is spending -- a hunt certain to gather urgency once the next recession hits.</p>
        <p>In some places, Americans still make inviting targets. Not even the latest innovations in combining shampoo and creme rinse have shaken Muslim fundamentalists from defining the righteous state as one clean of American influence. But even Cuba's Fidel Castro, on his recent trip to New York, shucked his combat fatigues for the let's-make-a-deal look. To meet with people  named Rockefeller and Tisch, he wore a business suit.</p>
