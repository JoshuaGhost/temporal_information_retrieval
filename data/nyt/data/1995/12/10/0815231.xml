        <p>IT was about four years ago that Federal highway safety officials realized that air bags could kill children.</p>
        <p>In 1991, researchers at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ran tests in which sleds equipped with air bags were rammed into barriers at high speeds. The bags deployed with explosive force, slamming into the rear-facing infant seats strapped on the passenger side and damaging the infant-sized dummies placed inside.</p>
        <p>We saw what was happening and said 'Wow,' " said Barry Felrice, the agency's associate administrator for safety performance standards.</p>
        <p>That same year, highway safety officials issued their first public warning about potential dangers of air bags to children in rear-facing infant seats. But now, with a possible link between air bags and the deaths of at least eight children in low-speed crashes, many car owners have started to worry about the hazards of a much-vaunted safety device. Most troubling, safety experts say, is  that some of the deaths occurred in minor accidents that normally would have resulted in little or no injury.</p>
        <p>"They are proven life savers," Mr. Felrice said. "But they also have some adverse side effects."</p>
        <p>Air bags have compiled an admirable record and are credited with saving more  than 900 lives since 1987. And they are about to become more pervasive. Under Federal rules, dual air bags are required in 1998 model-year cars and 1999 model-year light trucks and vans. Many drivers, however, do not realize that the bags can be dangerous.</p>
        <p>Federal safety officials say children under 12 years of age should preferably ride in the rear of a car and use a seat belt or a child-safety seat. Also, rear-facing infant seats should never be placed in the front seat of a car equipped with a passenger-side air bag.</p>
        <p>In a report last year, Federal safety officials found during spot checks that 36 percent of children in infant restraints were riding in the front seat and in a rear-facing position, creating a "potential danger from a deploying passenger-side air bag."</p>
        <p>In addition to the possible danger that air bags pose to children, Federal safety officials are concerned that the bags may have contributed to deaths and  injuries of older adults, who are prone to air bag-related problems because their bones are more brittle.</p>
        <p>To address the problems, the Ford Motor Company has produced models with a manual switch that can disarm a passenger-side air bag. For its part, Mercedes-Benz and other car manufacturers sell vehicles with sensors that automatically adjust the tension of seat belts in a serious crash to prevent the occupant from sliding forward.</p>
        <p>Matthew Reed, a senior research associate at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, said that producing a safer air bag presented a predicament. The devices must be energized so they deploy quickly in an accident, but such aggressiveness has a price, particularly under conditions that are not life threatening.</p>
        <p>"They are complicated trade-offs between protection in a high-speed collision and in a low-speed collision," he said.</p>
        <p>Ford has stated, for example, that Federal air-bag rules passed in 1984 resulted in overly aggressive bags because the regulations failed to discriminate as to whether a motorist was wearing a seat belt.</p>
        <p>In an effort to produce a less aggressive bag, the company recently proposed  that the Government change its testing requirements. Those tests, developed in the 1980's, are now run at 30 miles an hour with unbelted dummies. Ford, pointing to the fact that most people now wear seat belts, proposed changing the tests so they are run on belted dummies at 35 miles an hour, meaning that bags would not be activated in minor crashes. That could reduce air-bag injuries, Ford contends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Felrice said agency officials were uncertain about the trade-offs in different types of tests. "One result may be more injuries to unbelted occupants, whether they are children or adults," he said.</p>
        <p>For their part, air-bag producers are also developing new designs. Simply folding undeployed air bags differently can reduce their aggressiveness when they inflate. And some manufacturers are working on so-called smart bags that can adjust how aggressively they inflate, or not deploy at all, by sensing whether a seat is occupied, the size of that occupant and the severity of a crash.</p>
        <p>Don DeFosset, president of the safety restraint unit of Allied Signal, an air-bag producer, said a device under development had two settings that could adjust the aggressiveness of an air bag's deployment based on the speed of a crash. He said he expected such air bags to start showing up in cars in four to  six model years.</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Reed, the Michigan researcher, said there was no information to  help consumers select cars based on the safety of their air bags. But there is still plenty that motorists can do to help make air bags safer, he added.</p>
        <p>"One good reason to wear your seat belt is so that an air bag can function more effectively," Mr. Reed said. "In fact, it is more important that you wear a seat belt when you are in a car with an air bag."</p>
