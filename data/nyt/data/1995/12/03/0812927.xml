        <p>WHEN CHEEK BY JOWL opens its production of "The Duchess of Malfi" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater on Wednesday, the play will be in rehearsal. And it still will be when the company returns to its native England two weeks later.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the director, Declan Donnellan, and his actors will be meeting at least once a week to try out new ideas and make changes throughout the last six  months of a world tour that began in September.</p>
        <p>But then this is a troupe that rehearsed Shakespeare's "Measure for Measure" on the very last day of seven months of performances; so Webster's Jacobean tragedy -- part of the Next Wave Festival at BAM -- is not getting special treatment.</p>
        <p>Evidence of group madness? Not really. The approach has won a company formed  14 years ago no less than five Olivier Awards, including two for the all-male revival of Shakespeare's "As You Like It" that received acclaim at BAM last year.</p>
        <p>Are they obsessively serious about their art? Yes -- and convinced, as Mr. Donnellan sees it, "that the ideal of a perfect finished article in the theater  is rubbish."</p>
        <p>"We have to acknowledge we're on a path of discovery," he says, "and that at  the heart of every great play there's something mysterious. We're not a group of experts producing something of which we're completely in control. So our productions are always works in progress."</p>
        <p>That explains why Cheek by Jowl has often staged 16th- and 17th-century classics: Shakespeare, Racine and now Webster's story of the duchess who marries beneath her, thus incurring the wrath and vengeance of her two brothers. The plays the company chooses must be rich enough to insure that months spent ranging the globe -- Romania to Australia, Italy and Japan -- don't become empty and disheartening. "We tend not to do stuff about four people in a flat talking  about how their lives have changed since they were students," says Mr. Donnellan dryly.</p>
        <p>By contrast, he believes, "The Duchess of Malfi," which dates from 1612, has  a dense, sinewy quality not to be found even in Shakespeare, Webster's older contemporary: "It's about the supernatural, about sex, politics, spirituality, redemption, told through a poetic medium. Webster wrote only two important plays, this and 'The White Devil,' and you get the feeling he threw everything at it."</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Donnellan had performed the role of the Duchess's twin, Duke Ferdinand, in a student production of "Malfi" at Cambridge University 20 years ago. Nick Ormerod, who founded Cheek by Jowl with him and designs all its productions, played the other brother, the Cardinal. But Mr. Donnellan shrugs off that experience. It is an article of faith with him to enter the rehearsal room knowing the text extremely well but without any fixed notion of how the characters are to be interpreted. "We see ourselves as picture restorers," he says, "tearing away the sentimental varnish that plays have accrued over the years."</p>
        <p>In the case of "The Duchess," probably the most frequently performed non-Shakespearean tragedy in England, the results of this approach have proved startling.</p>
        <p>The protagonist has conventionally been seen as a wholly virtuous woman persecuted by wholly villainous brothers. As the smartly dressed, chain-smoking  Anastasia Hille plays the role -- the period is a vaguely Mussolini-esque 1920's -- the Duchess is an imperious, willful figure. She openly mocks Ferdinand, and  certainly doesn't succumb to abuse with traditional docility. "At times, she's a screaming termagent," says Mr. Donnellan. "I never foresaw how far we'd go down  that road."</p>
        <p>What has also emerged in rehearsal is that all three siblings have been trapped, presumably from childhood, in identities not of their choosing. But Ms. Hille's character is trying -- first by marrying her steward, Antonio, and later in her battles with her brothers -- to release the person beneath the role of duchess.</p>
        <p>THE PLAY IS ABOUT THE humiliation we must welcome into our lives if we're to  discover who we really are," says Mr. Donnellan. "The Duchess must lose all her  vanities, and for her that's a crucifixion."</p>
        <p>In his view, she makes the same emotional journey as Oedipus, Lear and many other tragic characters; but not so wholeheartedly. That is evident when Ms. Hille comes to the most famous line in the play. Robbed of husband and children, threatened and tormented by her brothers, she simply says, "I am Duchess of Malfi still." These words are usually delivered either defiantly or with quiet patience. But in rehearsals, Mr. Donnellan suggested that Ms. Hille put on her own head a crown worn by one of the lunatics that her brothers have set upon her. The line can thus be read as a sardonic sneer at the character's old identity and her inability to shed it fully.</p>
        <p>"Yes, that's how Anastasia is playing it at the moment," says Mr. Donnellan,  implying not only that the intonation is her own choice but that it may be different when the production reaches America. That's very Cheek by Jowl. Though the text is always scrupulously observed, and substantial changes will be discussed during rehearsals, the actors have the freedom, as Mr. Donnellan puts  it, "to vary how they get from point A to point B from night to night."</p>
        <p>That helps explain the exhilarating immediacy and directness that has marked  Cheek by Jowl's best work. Yet it is far from the only work with which Mr. Donnellan is occupied. For the National Theater, he has successfully staged Ibsen's "Peer Gynt" and Stephen Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd." There, too, he gave Tony Kushner's "Angels in America," a production strong enough to insure its triumphal progress to Broadway. Now, he is readying himself to direct next year's big West End musical: "Martin Guerre" by the authors of "Les Miserables"  and "Miss Saigon," Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Schonberg.</p>
        <p>But meanwhile, "The Duchess of Malfi" is mainly on his mind. So far, it has been received with interestingly diverse enthusiasm. In Dublin, the critics found it witty; in Rome, strongly emotional; in England, crisp and lucid. And in New York? "Well, it's not exactly a feel-good evening," says Mr. Donnellan. "It's about vanity and anger and despair. We'll have to see."</p>
