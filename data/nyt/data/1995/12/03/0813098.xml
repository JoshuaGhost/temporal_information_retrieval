        <p>Though temperatures have dipped, chances are the ground hasn't frozen in the  New York area, so don't mulch perennials and newly planted shrubs and trees until it does. Remember, the mulch is supposed to keep the ground frozen in case a warm spell comes along and then a cold spell. Cycles of thawing and freezing can heave those plants right out of the ground.</p>

        <p>Keep a journal as you put the garden to bed, making note of what worked this year and what you want to order or plant for the perfect garden next year. Start sketching the plants and forms of your garden, to let the shapes and scale of it all seep into your mind. Some new ideas may come of it.</p>
