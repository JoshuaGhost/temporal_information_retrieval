        <p>A homeless man clutching a hypodermic needle lunged at a 6-year-old girl riding with her mother on a subway train in midtown Manhattan yesterday afternoon, the police said. Officials said they were uncertain whether the needle had punctured the girl's skin or what substance, if any, the syringe might have contained.</p>
        <p>Officials at Bellevue Hospital Center, where the girl was treated and released, told the police that they had found a mark indicating that the girl might have been pierced in the right thigh. Laboratory tests were being conducted to determine whether the syringe contained anything, the police said.</p>

        <p>A homeless man clutching a hypodermic needle lunged at a 6-year-old girl riding with her mother on a subway train in midtown Manhattan yesterday afternoon, the police said. Officials said they were uncertain whether the needle had punctured the girl's skin or what substance, if any, the syringe might have contained.</p>
        <p>Officials at Bellevue Hospital Center, where the girl was treated and released, told the police that they had found a mark indicating that the girl might have been pierced in the right thigh. Laboratory tests were being conducted to determine whether the syringe contained anything, the police said.</p>
        <p>The incident occurred at about 12:35 P.M. on a southbound F train near 42d Street and Sixth Avenue, the police said. Two bystanders who witnessed the attack grabbed the man and held him until police officers arrived. The suspect had two other hypodermic needles, both empty, in his pocket when he was arrested, the police said.</p>
        <p>The girl and her mother were not identified. The suspect was described by the police, who did not identify him, as a homeless man in his 50's. He was charged  with assault and three counts of possessing a hypodermic needle, Police Officer  Debra Kearns, a department spokeswoman, said.</p>
