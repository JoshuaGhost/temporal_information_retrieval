        <p>After two years of searching for a tenant to rent the ground floor of his building, Stephen Corelli was elated this summer when he found a dry cleaner to  lease the 3,500-square-foot storefront at 39 N. Moore Street. "I figured this would be a nice amenity for the residents upstairs," said Mr. Corelli, 37, who lives in the 10-unit luxury condominium.</p>
        <p>But what he regards as a convenience, his neighbors -- who include the actor  Harvey Keitel and the MTV chief, Tom Freston -- see as a toxic menace. Residents fear that perchloroethylene, the chemical agent used in dry cleaning and a suspected carcinogen, will threaten their health.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corelli and his neighbors are locked in a nasty battle over the dry-cleaning plant, which has turned friends into enemies. "This has become war," he said.</p>
        <p>Residents have hired a well-known community lawyer, Jack Lester, to fight Mr. Corelli and are trying to mobilize the entire block against him. Robert Morrison, an art dealer who lives above Mr. Corelli, had hoped the space would attract an antique shop or art gallery. "Instead," he said, "we've gotten a factory that's going to destroy us." Mr. Morrison is leading the battle against  the dry cleaner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corelli says he believes the health concerns are a smokescreen.  "When I  first consulted Robert Morrison about this," he said, "his only concern was whether there would be a neon coat hanger in the window. To me, this is about real estate values and nothing else."</p>
        <p>Several tenants say they will move if the dry-cleaning business opens. But the cleaner's owner, Jeff Namm, says their fears are misguided. The machinery he has installed is "the safest, most up-to-date on the market today," he said.</p>
        <p>"These regs are the most stringent in the country," said Jim Austin of the State Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
        <p>But the Public Advocate, Mark Green, believes that all dry-cleaning plants should be located away from residential buildings. "Why play Russian roulette with a toxic chemical?" he asked.</p>
