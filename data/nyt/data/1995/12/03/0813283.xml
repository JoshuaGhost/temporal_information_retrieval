        <p>It's hard to come to terms with a place like Jupiter. So formidable, more than 1,000 times the size of Earth, Jupiter could swallow all the other planets  in the solar system with room to spare. So far away from the Sun, it is a frigid sphere enveloped by a cloud of ammonia ice crystals. And in every other respect, Jupiter's a real gasbag. There is practically nothing to it but gases, hydrogen  and helium, which become denser with depth until they behave more like liquids. But nowhere on the enormous planet is there a liquid ocean to navigate  or a single square foot of solid land to stand on.</p>
        <p>Which may explain why we never traveled to Jupiter in our imagination long before we were able to go there in reality, as authors and actors did so often and so vividly with the Moon and Mars. There was no place of encountering anything like the beautiful Dejah Thos, Princess of Helium, or any kind of life. Edgar Rice Burroughs (also of Tarzan fame) sensibly confined the exploits of John Carter, gentleman adventurer, to Mars.</p>

        <p>Which may explain why we never traveled to Jupiter in our imagination long before we were able to go there in reality, as authors and actors did so often and so vividly with the Moon and Mars. There was no place of encountering anything like the beautiful Dejah Thos, Princess of Helium, or any kind of life. Edgar Rice Burroughs (also of Tarzan fame) sensibly confined the exploits of John Carter, gentleman adventurer, to Mars.</p>
        <p>So it is that the actual exploration of Jupiter has been unburdened by fiction-driven misconceptions and expectations. In the last two decades, four spacecraft have passed by the huge planet for quick but revealing surveys. Now one called Galileo is streaking in for a visit of at least two years. Its arrival is being heralded infactual but dramatic fashion by "On Jupiter," a one-hour special that will be shown on the Discovery Channel tonight at 9.</p>
        <p>The show is a timely preview of coming attractions. On Thursday, a cone-shaped, instrument-laden probe released by Galileo will plunge into the Jovian atmosphere at an initial velocity of 106,000 miles per hour -- the highest impact speed ever acheived by a human artifact. The probe should continue to penetrate deep into the planet's dense atmosphere for the first direct measurements of temperatures, presures and other physical properties of the Jovian gaseous interior. Not long afterward, the main spacecraft -- two and  a half tons of cameras, computers, radios and steering gear -- should rocket into an orbit of Jupiter for the first long-term investigation of any of the giant outer planets (Saturn, Uranus and Neptune being the others).</p>
        <p>Photogenic Jupiter makes an ideal subject for television. Powerful winds separate the planet's outer atmosphere into wide horizontal bands of color: latitudes of brown and burnt orange between layers of pale blue, gray and white. A designer could not execute a more delicately beautiful bauble; scientists hope the Galileo probe can explain the sources of these colors.</p>
        <p>And by way of punctuation, there is on the face of jupiter the Great Red Spot, a roiling cyclone extending over an area the size of several Earths. These colorful bands and storms appear in time-lapse photography to be in continuous motion, yet never to change their essential character.</p>
        <p>These fascinating views, mainly shot by the two Voyager spacecraft in 1979,  are on display to good effect in "On Jupiter." Savor them, for it will be months before Galileo can transmit its own pictures. Because the spacecraft's primary antenna has failed to deploy, picture data will have to be stored on a tape recorder for later and slower transmission by a smaller antenna, unhandling scientific data relayed from the probe.</p>
        <p>As the television show makes clear, Jupiter the planet is only part of the Jovian family spectacle. At least 16 moons have been counted in its vicinity. Four of them -- Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto -- are large enough to rate as planets, if they were free of Jovian gravity.</p>
        <p>It was the discovery of these satellites in 1610 by Galileo himself that ushered in the age of telescope astronomy, and inspired the choice of the name for the $1.6 billion mission. By observing the ballet of motion of the four spheres in orbit of the larger central object, Galileo could imagine the configuration and behavior of the Sun and its planets. This insight dealt the decisive blow to the prevailing theory that Earth was the center of the solar system.</p>
        <p>The close-up pictures of the major moons are testimony to the esthetic as well as the scientific appeal of Jovian exploration. Io's surface looks like a pizza with volcanoes. Europa's frozen surface looks like a cracked egg, beneath  which may lie a warm ocean (where there just may be life, if any exists elsewhere in the solar system). Ganymede is a world of dirty ice and glaciers that rivals Mars in size. Callisto, as big as the planet Mercury, is scarred with craters everywhere.</p>
        <p>In the narration by the actor John Hurt and in several informative interviews with scientists, "On Jupiter" captures the mounting excitement as Galileo appraoches Jupiter and its varied satellites. If some of the Voyager photography seems familiar, there is considerable fresh material about the Galileo mission itself and nature's warm-up act, the fragmented Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet that collided with Jupiter in July 1994.</p>
        <p>The discovery and tracking of the comet, its disintegration under the influence of Jovian tidal forces and those first direct hits of a planet ever witnessed on Earth all make for fascinating television. Every major observatory  on Earth and also the Hubble Space Telescope focused on Jupiter to examine the effects of each impacting piece of the comet. As the show makes clear, Galileo was in position to take the most revealing pictures of the impacts.</p>
        <p>The Shoemaker-Levy impacts not only served as a prelude to the Galileo probe's crash into the Jovian atmosphere, but they also illustrated the importance of Jupiter in our earthly existence. The explosive power of those cometary impacts was a demonstration of what has happened so often in the history of the solar system. An asteroid or comet crashed into Earth 65 million  years ago and presumably hastened the demise of the dinosaurs, clearing the way  for mammals and eventually humans to expand and thrive. If it had not been for Jupiter's powerful gravity, sucking in planetary debris from all over the solar  system like a vacuum cleaner, even more catastrophes might have befallen Earth,  making it virtually unlivable.</p>
        <p>"On Jupiter" is directed by Richard Smith, who also directed the documentary "E.T.: Please Phone Home," which won a gold medal for science and technology programs at the 1994 New York Television Awards.</p>
        <p>A year from now, if the Galileo spacecraft fulfills only half of its promises, the producers and director may want to bring out a sequel. Even if Galileo's antenna problem reduces the data and picture output, limiting the mission to less than 70 percent of its goals, as predicted, we should be looking over the shoulders of scientists and seeing Jupiter and its moons in a more familiar light. These places may still be stranger than fiction, but perhaps a little more understandable.</p>
