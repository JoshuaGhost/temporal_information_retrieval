        <p>IF ALICE IN CHAINS IS TIRED OF being called a grunge band, it can be a grudge band instead. On its third album, "Alice in Chains" (there have also been three  EP's), the band from Seattle settles into its electric mode: slow-grinding, diminished or minor-chord guitar riffs and calmly accusatory vocals, with an occasional shift into a major key to belie lyrics like "Heaven beside you . . .  hell within."</p>
        <p>On the band's previous releases, Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell, the band's  guitarists and main songwriters, have specialized in sociopathic misery, writing about despair, isolation and drug addiction. "Alice in Chains" (Columbia) moves  from torment to vindictiveness. "You have always told me you would not live past 25," Staley sings in "Sludge Factory." "I say, stay long enough to repay all who caused strife."</p>

        <p>IF ALICE IN CHAINS IS TIRED OF being called a grunge band, it can be a grudge band instead.

        <p>On the band's previous releases, Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell, the band's  guitarists and main songwriters, have specialized in sociopathic misery, writing about despair, isolation and drug addiction. "Alice in Chains" (Columbia) moves  from torment to vindictiveness. "You have always told me you would not live past 25," Staley sings in "Sludge Factory." "I say, stay long enough to repay all who caused strife."</p>
        <p>Like Michael Jackson on "HIStory," but with fewer petty details and broader  paranoia, Alice in Chains envisions most of the outside world as gossiping, two-faced persecutors. The band hadn't exactly spiffed up its image with songs like "Junkhead" on its 1992 album, "Dirt," which gave its most memorable tune to the chorus "What's your drug of choice/ What have you got?" Now, the band insists that such songs weren't autobiographical. "Grind" advises against believing "what you may have heard and what you think you know," while other songs perceive a conspiracy of evil rumors: "Head Creeps" denounces "lackeys' loose talk for fact."</p>
        <p>At times, the narrator accepts part of the blame: "I must say I was stupid,"  Cantrell and Staley sing in "Shame in You." And some songs, like "God Am" and "Nothin' Song," simply return to the the band's usual death-haunted anomie. But  most of the bitterness is directed at others, who may be lovers, friends, acquaintances or media figures. In "Grind," Cantrell writes that he'd like to hear "the sound of your body breaking/ as I take you down."</p>
        <p>Alice in Chains never went in for the distortion that gave grunge its name. Its songs are cleanly delineated and meticulously layered, rarely straying from  a tone of sullen stubbornness. The band is instantly recognizable and narrowly focused; it has matched an emotional niche to a musical one.</p>
