        <p>Former Vice President Dan Quayle was admitted to a hospital in Indianapolis over the New Year's weekend for elective surgical removal of an enlarged appendix later this week, his office said yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was the second admission to the same hospital in a month for the 47-year-old Mr. Quayle, who is widely expected to seek the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination. On Dec. 6, he was discharged from Indiana University Hospital after an eight-day stay for treatment of blood clots in both lungs. His doctors said they believed that the clots had formed in veins in his leg during prolonged sitting on airplanes and broken off to lodge in blood vessels in his lungs.</p>

        <p>Former Vice President Dan Quayle was admitted to a hospital in Indianapolis over the New Year's weekend for elective surgical removal of an enlarged appendix later this week, his office said yesterday.</p>
        <p>It was the second admission to the same hospital in a month for the 47-year-old Mr. Quayle, who is widely expected to seek the 1996 Republican Presidential nomination. On Dec. 6, he was discharged from Indiana University Hospital after an eight-day stay for treatment of blood clots in both lungs. His doctors said they believed that the clots had formed in veins in his leg during prolonged sitting on airplanes and broken off to lodge in blood vessels in his lungs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle's doctors believe that "he is almost fully recovered from his recent problem with pulmonary blood clots," a spokeswoman, Anne Hathaway, said yesterday. Mr. Quayle is taking an anticoagulant drug to help prevent recurrence of blood clots, and is expected to continue it for another five months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle is not suffering from acute appendicitis, and the removal of the appendix will be done as elective surgery, said Ms. Hathaway, who is with Mr. Quayle's political action group, Issues '96. She said she did not know whether it would be done by the standard technique or a minimally invasive procedure with a laparoscope, a device with a light and a magnifying camera that allows surgeons to operate through tiny incisions rather than the standard large one.</p>
        <p>Blood clots of the type Mr. Quayle developed sometimes occur in individuals with chronic conditions like rheumatic diseases, circulatory problems and cancer. Mr. Quayle's doctors said last month that they would test for such conditions.</p>
        <p>As part of a search for an underlying cause of the blood clots, on Dec. 3 Mr. Quayle underwent a CAT scan X-ray of the abdomen. "A small abnormality was noted in the appendix, which probably represents old appendicitis," Indiana University Medical Center said in a news release at the time. There was no mention of possible surgery.</p>
        <p>"The doctors gave him the option of doing it now or waiting until it ruptured and he needed emergency surgery," Ms. Hathaway said, adding that Mr. Quayle had said he "just wants the 'thing' out -- I don't need it anyway!"</p>
        <p>During Mr. Quayle's hospital admission last month, medical center officials issued news releases and were his spokesmen.</p>
        <p>But this time, news about Mr. Quayle's condition is being handled strictly by Mr. Quayle's office, Issues '96, and not by the medical center, at the specific request of Mr. Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, a hospital spokeswoman said.</p>
        <p>In explaining the change of procedure, Mary Maxwell, a spokeswoman for the hospital, said the Quayles had said they "did not foresee any great degree of media interest in it this time and they thought that Anne Hathaway would be quite capable of handling all the media calls."</p>
        <p>But apparently minor discrepancies have arisen about the timing of Mr. Quayle's most recent admission to the hospital.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hathaway said that Mr. Quayle was admitted to the hospital on Monday afternoon and that the operation would be performed on Wednesday or Thursday. But Ms. Maxwell, the hospital spokeswoman, said Mr. Quayle was admitted on Sunday.</p>
        <p>Asked for the reason for Mr. Quayle's most recent admission, Ms. Maxwell said: "I don't have that information. The Quayles have requested that all medical information be handled by his office, so they have really constrained the information that I have the ability to release."</p>
        <p>At the time of his discharge in December, Mr. Quayle promised to make a decision on his political future early in 1995. His doctors advised him to limit his schedule and forgo air travel for at least a month. He was recently cleared to fly, Ms. Hathaway said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quayle is expected to be hospitalized for about seven days.</p>
