        <p>The consumer electronics division of Samsung Electronics America has selected the Arnell Group in New York to handle its advertising and marketing account, which had been at Poppe Tyson in New York for the last four years. The billings were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Thomas Rhee, senior manager for marketing communications and research at Samsung in Ridgefield Park, N.J., said last week that Arnell was awarded the account after a two-month review that included two other undisclosed finalists. Arnell, which created television commercials for the division that ran late last year, was also awarded new corporate program assignments.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA</p>
