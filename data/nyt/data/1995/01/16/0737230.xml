        <p>As O. J. Simpson heads for trial this week on murder charges, an extraordinary and apparently irreparable breach has developed between two of his lawyers: Robert L. Shapiro and Mr. Shapiro's former mentor, F. Lee Bailey.</p>

        <p>As O. J. Simpson heads for trial this week on murder charges, an extraordinary and apparently irreparable breach has developed between two of his lawyers: Robert L. Shapiro and Mr. Shapiro's former mentor, F. Lee Bailey.</p>
        <p>The feud, which will be left to a third member of the defense team, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., to referee or resolve, is an embarrassing distraction, becoming public only four days before opening statements, which are set for Thursday. It stems from the results of an internal investigation by Mr. Simpson's main investigator, William Pavelic of Los Angeles, into disclosures to the press.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavelic concluded and reported to Mr. Simpson and other members of his legal team that for the past several months Mr. Bailey and his associates had engaged in a systematic and elaborate campaign of disclosures to the press, principally to columnists for Eastern papers, CNN and supermarket tabloids. The object, Mr. Pavelic concluded, was to denigrate Mr. Shapiro's legal skills and his ability to keep client confidences, and to enhance Mr. Bailey's modest role in the case.</p>
        <p>But although Mr. Pavelic concluded that Mr. Bailey was stage-managing the campaign, others on the defense team were not so sure. They depicted Mr. Bailey's investigators as rogue elephants out to please their boss.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro and Mr. Bailey have long been close friends. When Mr. Bailey was charged with drunken driving in 1982, he hired Mr. Shapiro to represent him. Mr. Shapiro, in turn, has repeatedly described Mr. Bailey as his mentor and a father figure. He made Mr. Bailey the godfather of his eldest son and repeatedly sent him business, including this coveted role in one of the most closely followed cases in history.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pavelic's investigation concluded that Mr. Bailey and his entourage, including three investigators he brought into the case, had planted articles that Mr. Shapiro was more a negotiator than an aggressive trial lawyer and that he lacked courtroom experience. It also blamed the Bailey team for more recent reports that Mr. Simpson had moved Mr. Shapiro aside and elevated Mr. Bailey and Mr. Cochran.</p>
        <p>The result is a chasm in Mr. Simpson's defense team. For the last three weeks, Mr. Shapiro has refused to speak with Mr. Bailey and says he will never speak with him again except on urgent matters pertaining to the Simpson case. Nor will he be photographed with him, he says, nor even ride in the same car. He has also removed Mr. Bailey's name from his letterhead, where he has the largely honorific title of "of counsel."</p>
        <p>"The landmark word to me is 'loyalty,' " Mr. Shapiro said in an interview. "I felt a lifelong commitment to him because he gave me the opportunity to represent him when his professional reputation was at stake. But recent events have been so painful that we'll never be able to have a relationship again."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey did not return telephone calls. When he appeared on CNN on Saturday, he expressed concern about disclosures to the press and expressed confidence that Mr. Shapiro had not been the sieve. "I've known the man long enough to be satisfied he would never do anything like that," Mr. Bailey said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro said he would play no role in deciding Mr. Bailey's status.  "Ultimately, it's going to be Johnnie's decision," he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Cochran's maneuvering room is limited. If it is unwieldy to have co-counsels who are not speaking on the eve of a trial, it is unseemly to discharge anyone as well. Defense lawyers also may fear that Mr. Bailey and his investigators could make embarrassing disclosures about the case down the road.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson is known to like Mr. Bailey and could try to make Mr. Shapiro get along with him. "The real challenge for Bob is going to be to bite his lip and not let this interfere," said a lawyer on the defense team who would comment only on the condition of not being named.</p>
        <p>Another member of the defense team said, "All of us are caught between a rock and a hard place -- all of us." He called the dispute "a 10-alarm fire" and "an attempted coup d'etat."</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavelic's investigation also involved a trap for Mr. Bailey and his associates in the process of planting an article. Late last November Mr. Pavelic, who was assigned by Mr. Simpson's long-time personal lawyer, Leroy Taft, to find out about the persistent disclosures, told erroneous information only to a member of Mr. Bailey's team. When a reporter promptly called another of Mr. Simpson's lawyers to check out the information, the trap was tripped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pavelic, who declined to comment, also concluded that at least one time, Mr. Shapiro had been set up to appear as the source of a particularly egregious disclosure: Mr. Simpson's statement to the police on June 13, the day after Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald L. Goldman were slain. Portions of that statement appeared in a report in Star, a supermarket tabloid. Mr. Bailey's team, and not Mr. Shapiro's, had probably leaked that document, the investigator concluded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bailey represented Dr. Sam Sheppard and Patricia Hearst earlier in his career but had largely gone into professional eclipse until Mr. Shapiro brought him into the Simpson case last July as a behind-the-scenes strategist. Mr. Bailey had remained in the background until he cross-examined a witness at a hearing last week. At trial, he was set to handle limited scientific evidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shapiro said he hoped that Mr. Bailey would now leave the Simpson team. "His presence before this particular jury adds nothing that can't be done by Johnnie and others on the team," he said. But the decision, he added, would not be his. "Because some of the false stories have had a personal impact on me, I'm leaving that decision to Mr. Cochran,' he said.</p>
        <p>"It's adversely affected O. J.'s interests, but we're beyond that," he said. "We are ready for this case."</p>
