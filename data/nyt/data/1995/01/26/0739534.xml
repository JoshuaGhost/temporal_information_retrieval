        <p>TO mark the 60th anniversary of its design collection, the Museum of Modern Art will show, on Feb. 16, some "Recent Acquisitions" -- about 40 objects, many made of materials that did not exist when the museum's design department was formed. The objects include (clockwise from top right) Apple Computer's 1993 adjustable keyboard, Technics's 1988 SST-1 loudspeaker and Flos's 1992 hanging lamp by Achille Castiglioni. The museum is also reissuing the 1934 catalogue from its first design show, "Machine Art." Key pieces from that installation (above left) will also be on display.</p>

        <p>Over the years, the design department has faced criticism for neglecting American designers, but about a third of the objects in the show are by Americans. Was this a conscious decision? No, said Terence Riley, the chief curator of architecture and design. "The only thing we can do is promote good design."</p>
