        <p>I did my Christmas shopping early this year. Traveling around southern China and Hong Kong I bought Microsoft Word and Word Perfect for $10 each. Picked up a CD of Walt Disney's "The Lion King" for $4.50 and got an armful of Disney sweatshirts for small change. They were all pirated rip-offs produced in Chinese factories and they were about as hard to buy here as noodles and white rice.</p>
        <p>Pretty brazen, you say, selling all this bootleg out in the open? Hey, that's nothing. Joseph Stiglitz, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, once got a letter from a Chinese pirate publisher asking him to write a special preface for the pirated Chinese edition of his own economics textbook -- for which he was receiving no royalties.</p>

        <p>I did my Christmas shopping early this year. Traveling around southern China and Hong Kong I bought Microsoft Word and Word Perfect for $10 each.

They were all pirated rip-offs produced in Chinese factories and they were about as hard to buy here as noodles and white rice.</p>
        <p>Pretty brazen, you say, selling all this bootleg out in the open? Hey, that's nothing. Joseph Stiglitz, a member of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, once got a letter from a Chinese pirate publisher asking him to write a special preface for the pirated Chinese edition of his own economics textbook -- for which he was receiving no royalties.</p>
        <p>How do you say chutzpah in Chinese?</p>
        <p>Whether it's MS-DOS or Mickey Mouse, these pirate goods are only the most visible symbol of why China is becoming America's biggest trade headache, not just opportunity. The Clinton Administration has decided -- rightly -- that it is time to confront Beijing. Washington recently blocked China's entry into the new World Trade Organization, until it agrees to accept some basic norms of international commerce, and has threatened China with $2.8 billion in punitive tariffs if it does not start closing its 29 pirate CD factories.</p>
        <p>The Chinese assumed American businesses would come to their rescue and force the Administration to back down, as happened last year when Mr. Clinton tried to link trade with China's human rights behavior. But, for now, most of the American business community has stood with the Administration. This has produced an important shift in the balance of power between Washington and Beijing.</p>
        <p>Talking to American executives working in China, it is striking how many of them sound like members of Amnesty International these days. Why? Because businesses are learning that China's trade abuses and human rights abuses are just flip sides of the same coin -- the absence of the rule of law. Many businesses thought they could finesse that absence of laws with "Guanxi," or "connections" with key Chinese officials.</p>
        <p>But connections didn't help McDonald's when the Chinese ignored its 20-year lease and booted the Big Mac from its biggest restaurant in the world off Tiananmen Square, to make room for a commercial complex; they didn't help Lehman Brothers when it was stiffed by two state-owned Chinese trading companies, which allegedly owe it $100 million; they have not helped the many U.S. businesses that have been frozen out of the retail market in China by huge Chinese trading companies linked to the army and ruling families, and they haven't helped the foreign firms in China that are forced to pay triple what the Chinese do for airline tickets, office space or electricity.</p>
        <p>China has been able to get away with this because it is so big that every major company felt it had to have a stake here. But lately, the risks of doing business in China have begun to outweigh the rewards because the elephant is turning out to be a rogue. Says John Kamm, a leading American business consultant in China: "The same arbitrary abuse of power that characterized China's overall human rights behavior is now the principal obstacle to doing successful business in China."</p>
        <p>This is not going to be easy to remedy. Because when we ask China's leaders to observe basic trade norms, we are asking them to institute commercial laws, independent courts, anti-corruption measures, equal treatment for foreigners and to do away with their heads-I-win-tails-you-lose way of doing business. But all of that threatens China's political and military elite, who own a lot of the pirate factories and benefit from the arbitrariness and corruption.</p>
        <p>Many American businesses thought that once we delinked human rights and trade, our China problem would go away. They were wrong. The same Chinese boot that stomped on democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square in 1989, stomped on Ronald McDonald in Tiananmen Square in 1994. That is why before this story is over American business, which was so insistent on getting human rights and democracy off the agenda of Sino-American relations, will have to be at the forefront of putting them back there.</p>
