        <p>On land! On sea! In the air! Also in the sands, the jungles, the deeps and wherever else animals or humans can be photographed, you'll find a National Geographic camera team. If you doubt it, have a look at "30 Years of National Geographic Specials," the brisk two-hour retrospective on NBC tonight.</p>
        <p>This generous, thematically organized scrapbook begins with predators and prey: a young elephant versus young lions; lions versus hyenas, in merciless battle; a wasp versus a spider that turns itself into a wheel; a woodpecker versus a snake versus an alligator; a crocodile and a tiger, competing for a deer. See a lizard walk on water!</p>

        <p>On land! On sea! In the air! Also in the sands, the jungles, the deeps and wherever else animals or humans can be photographed, you'll find a National Geographic camera team. If you doubt it, have a look at "30 Years of National Geographic Specials," the brisk two-hour retrospective on NBC tonight.</p>
        <p>This generous, thematically organized scrapbook begins with predators and prey: a young elephant versus young lions; lions versus hyenas, in merciless battle; a wasp versus a spider that turns itself into a wheel; a woodpecker versus a snake versus an alligator; a crocodile and a tiger, competing for a deer. See a lizard walk on water!</p>
        <p>Then it goes on to the romances of creatures big and small, with unexpurgated mating practices, the closest this exemplar of family television comes to naughtiness. That's followed by glimpses of how other species rear their young or let the young rear themselves.</p>
        <p>The narration is at times stuffy, but remarkable photography abounds, and now and then you even get a look at the photographers. You can also see adventurous scientists like Jane Goodall, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, Dian Fossey and the Leakeys, Louis, Mary and Richard, going about their good works. And just for fun, there's a wedding of Yemenite Jews; sibling rivalry among pygmies; traditional dancing in Bali, and the art of Australia's aborigines.</p>
        <p>Even if you've seen some of the original programs, on PBS, most are worth a second look. The program ends on a serious if familiar note, drawing attention to the modern world's assault on wildlife and on the environment. The plugs for National Geographic are discreet and, as the selection here demonstrates, well deserved.</p>
        <p>30 YEARS OF NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SPECIALS  NBC, tonight at 8. (Channel 4 in New York) Written by Gail Willumsen and edited by Barry Nye. Produced by Gail Willumsen and Mr. Nye. A National Geographic Television production. Tim Kelly, senior vice president of television. Nicolas Noxon, executive producer; Richard Kiley, narrator.  TELEVISION REVIEW</p>
