        <p>SEDUCTION  A Book of Stories</p>
        <p>Edited by Tony Peake</p>
        <p>224 pages. Serpent's Tail. Paperback, $11.99.</p>
        <p>The title has us: are we to be lured, enticed, persuaded against our judgment but not against our wishes, tricked, beguiled or consensually overpowered?</p>
        <p>The back cover of "Seduction" offers varied blandishments. First come these chipper words from Robert Louis Stevenson: "To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive." Then (you are already smirking since this is the man who penned "Treasure Island" and "A Child's Garden of Verses") you are somberly informed, "Now that sex is more fraught with danger than ever, seduction is an end in itself."</p>
        <p>And, you remind yourself, a seduction is a short story: every moment counts and you know from the beginning that you are headed for the end; the only question is what feelings you will be left with when it's over.</p>
        <p>A South African writer, Tony Peake, has edited this collection, and its contributors all live and work in England or its former colonies. Mr. Peake says the tale of Ulysses' encounter with the sirens is the archetypal seduction story, for it reveals "the awful power one person can exert over another, how that power can trick you off course and how willingly -- unless there's an accomplice on hand to lash one to the mast -- a person will abandon everything to follow the lure of the siren."</p>
        <p>Most of these stories follow that well-known course. A. L. Barker's "Soft Sell: A Fantasy" begins: "After the publication of her definitive history of seduction, detailing sexual practices from Cro-Magnon to Common Market man -- the habits and compulsions of lower animals, courtship displays, arousal emissions and the adhesive methods of mollusks, right down to basics such as the stimulation of gonads -- Atlanta rated a comprehensive entry in a directory of exceptional women." Since she is no longer young ("She forbore to tint her hair and did nothing about her face, which was jowly and rather Tudor; she sometimes caught Henry Five looking at her out of the mirror"), we suspect that a young man will happen along. And since her name conjures up the Atalanta of Greek myth, we can assume that she will outhunt and outrace him, only to be outsmarted in return.</p>
        <p>Here is Mr. Peake's "The Good Butler": "Ralph Goodall started swimming in the morning after his 40th birthday. He'd always planned to avoid the cliches of aging, but as the years proliferated, so the attraction he felt for younger men intensified, and in helpless thrall to this burgeoning obsession, so he began, unfavorably, to compare the sleekness of their hard, enticing bodies with the progressive softening of his own." We surmise that the story will play with social and sexual hierarchies and with the question of whether a servant can salvage his pride and stay in his place.</p>
        <p>Most of the stories are deft and entertaining, but few go further. The reader is soon put in the position of the bored seducer: the plot is transparent, so one's curiosity turns to indulgent weariness. Certain writers do work hard to surprise us. Will Self's "Incubus, or the Impossibility of Self-Determination as to Desire" is on the verge of being inventive, as it expands eros from people to the rooms they inhabit, and from their senses to their intellects. But like his title, his tale is so bent on being outrageously clever that it is destroyed by weighty metaphors and asides.</p>
        <p>In fiction as in life, the best seductions are eccentric or unexpected. As in Barbara Trapido's "Star Light; Star Bright: A Euro Story," when a small boy is seduced by the sight of night sky: "He knew that the stars were great luminous balls of gases and that young stars evolved, over millions of years, into red giants and white dwarfs. . . . He knew that Venus was the morning and the evening star. He knew Sirius the Dog Star. He knew that their isolation from each other was so great that it could be measured only in unimaginable waves of movement." Then there is the moment in Ms. Barker's "Soft Sell: A Fantasy," when Atlanta is transfixed by the sight of a viper-green car arriving at her curb, "smooth as a monster surfacing from the deep" and with a dashboard "studded with delicately quivering dials, an adjustable vanity mirror and glove compartment bearing the words 'hers' in silver filigree."</p>
        <p>My favorite stories are Elizabeth Young's "Short Eyes and the Green Dice," narrated by a perverse and vivacious ex-con, and Damon Galgut's more conventional "Strategy and Siege," in which we follow the attempted adventures of a divorced man on vacation in Nigeria. They get at the most frightening and mysterious form of seduction, the kind that needs revulsion as much as it needs attraction, and that tries to say what we fear is unsayable.</p>
        <p>In the end too many of these stories leave one feeling cheated, even abandoned. If writers are sirens, as Mr. Peake suggests in his introduction, then his are having some pitch problems. He would have done well to place Scheherazade alongside Ulysses in his seduction pantheon. Scheherazade knew that every word counts and that a failure of imagination means death.</p>
