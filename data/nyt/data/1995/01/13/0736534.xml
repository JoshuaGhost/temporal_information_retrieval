        <p>Anna Paparatti</p>
        <p>Annina Nosei Gallery  100 Prince Street  SoHo  Through Feb. 8</p>
        <p>If Joseph Stella had been a Buddhist he might have produced paintings like those in the first New York show of Anna Paparatti, an Italian artist who has worked in avant-garde theater and has been exhibiting in Europe for more than 20 years.</p>
        <p>Her paintings are as direct and guileless as the title of her show, "I Love Buddha." Most of them consist of a single image: an iconic Buddha seated with legs crossed, teaching or meditating with open eyes. In one series, the color scheme changes from piece to piece, like Josef Albers's chromatic studies. Elsewhere the figure sits under a massive tree adorned with silver leaves in winter and pink blossoms in the spring.</p>
        <p>Despite its Asian subject, this is pure European art. The spring painting depicts Himalayan peaks (Ms. Paparatti has spent much time in Nepal), but the Italian sunlight would make Stella's madonnas feel right at home. And although the Buddha is, as tradition demands, androgynous, Ms. Paparatti lends it a distinctly feminine guise, with artfully colored lips and shaded eyelids. The result is close to its devotional sources. It is also sweetly personal, showing an identification of artist with subject that is, one senses, complete. HOLLAND COTTER Suzan Etkin</p>
