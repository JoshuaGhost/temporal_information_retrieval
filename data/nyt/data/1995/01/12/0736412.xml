        <p>Emma Kates-Shaw is not old enough to appreciate traditions, but eventually, she might grow fond of one that began in her first year of life. Last month, her parents sent $50 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to celebrate her first Christmas and start an annual routine.</p>
        <p>"My dad and mom thought I should begin the tradition right away of sharing what I am so lucky to have," Anthony Shaw and Betsy Kates wrote on their daughter's behalf. "I especially hope this money can be used to help babies that are not so lucky."</p>

        <p>Emma Kates-Shaw is not old enough to appreciate traditions, but eventually, she might grow fond of one that began in her first year of life. Last month, her parents sent $50 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund to celebrate her first Christmas and start an annual routine.</p>
        <p>"My dad and mom thought I should begin the tradition right away of sharing what I am so lucky to have," Anthony Shaw and Betsy Kates wrote on their daughter's behalf. "I especially hope this money can be used to help babies that are not so lucky."</p>
        <p>Emma might be the youngest person to donate to the Neediest Cases, but she has joined dozens of others who count it among their family traditions. In letters, they say that contributing is a ritual rooted in winters past, one that lends cadence to the passing of years.</p>
        <p>"This enclosure marks my 57th contribution," wrote Rose Abramson of Manhattan, who sent $65. "I started in 1937, but don't remember the exact amount -- probably $5 or $10."</p>
        <p>Marion Schwartz of Valley Stream, L.I., wrote: "As I look around me after 30 years of contributing to the fund, it appears that conditions have gotten worse, not better. Because so much is needed by so many, I leave it to you to distribute my gift where it is most needed."</p>
        <p>Since 1912, the Neediest Cases Fund has helped seven charities sustain programs for the city's poor, sick, elderly and disabled. Among other things, the fund provides child care for single mothers, job training for newly arrived immigrants and counseling for homeless families. On a more basic level, it pays for groceries, furniture and medical care. Seven weeks into this year's campaign, the fund has raised $3,364,037.92.</p>
        <p>For some, donating to the Neediest Cases is a way of remembering a momentous event in their family history. Alfred and Hedwig Herz, refugees from Nazi Germany, contributed every December to celebrate the anniversary of their arrival in New York in 1937. They are dead now, but their children -- Hannah, Werner and Marcia Herz -- have carried on the tradition. This year, they sent $50.</p>
        <p>"In contributing to your fund, our parents expressed their gratitude for safety and opportunity we found in this country," they wrote.</p>
        <p>Others, like Mr. Kates and Ms. Shaw, give to the Neediest Cases every year to honor a child's birthday. When Peggy Epstein Tanner was born in 1957, her parents, Alan and Sally Epstein, sent their first donation to the fund. Last month, when she turned 37, they faithfully sent $138.</p>
        <p>"We have given a dollar for each of her years, adding $1 for good luck and then putting $100 in front of the amount because we so believe in your cause," they wrote.</p>
        <p>Dave Schoenfeld sent his first donation in 1934, when his daughter Florence turned 1. After he died, she continued to contribute annually, sending a dollar for each year of her life.</p>
        <p>"Between us, thankfully, we have never had to miss a year," wrote Florence Glazer, who lives in Yonkers and this year sent $61. "He taught me how truly thankful I should be to be able to give."</p>
        <p>Previously recorded $3,318,222.92 Recorded yesterday 45,815.00 Total $3,364,037.92</p>
