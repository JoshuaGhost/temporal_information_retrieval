        <p>Less than five months after its epic battle over the $30 billion crime bill and the legislation's ban on a variety of assault weapons, Congress is bracing for yet another all-out struggle over guns.</p>
        <p>There is little question that the Republican-controlled House has the votes to dump the ban; the questions there are how and when to do so. But it seems doubtful that Senate Republicans can muster the votes to go along with the repeal. And even if they do, Administration officials said today, a veto is certain.</p>
        <p>In the House, "the votes are there to repeal it -- I think that's a given," said Representative Bill McCollum of Florida, chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Criminal Justice, which opened hearings today on scaling back the crime legislation enacted last year.</p>
        <p>That overhaul is one provision of the agenda that House Republicans set for themselves in the "Contract With America." It would put less money into prevention and more into prisons than last year's bill and would give localities greater control over how to spend the money provided them.</p>
        <p>But because Republican strategists who drew up the "contract" during the election campaign last year were seeking as broad a consensus as possible, they omitted from it any mention of repealing the assault weapons ban.</p>
        <p>"We don't want it on this bill," Mr. McCollum said today, noting that 38 Republicans now in the House voted in favor of the ban last year and that the leaders wanted to display as much unity as possible. Including a repeal, said one top Republican aide, "would give the President the perfect opportunity to sink the reforms we have wanted for years by calling it a gun bill and vetoing it."</p>
        <p>But pressure is mounting from the gun lobby and various lawmakers to amend the new crime bill so that the repeal would be included. The National Rifle Association in particular has been adamant and has suggested that the repeal has a better chance of enactment if it is included in a package that appears tougher on criminals than the old package. The gun lobby is also telling Congressional Republicans that without the help of the lobby, they would not be in the majority now.</p>
        <p>At the subcommittee hearing today, Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who was a chief architect of the ban, got the Administration to commit to a veto of any repeal.</p>
        <p>Questioning Associate Attorney General John R. Schmidt, Mr. Schumer said, "I take it the Administration would be unalterably opposed and would veto any bill that would repeal the assault weapons ban?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Schmidt replied, "Yes." KATHARINE Q. SEELYE</p>
