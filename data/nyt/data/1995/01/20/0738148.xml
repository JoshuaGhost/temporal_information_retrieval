        <p>Women have begun to soar through the air in track and field, competing in the last exclusive male event in a sport that has been slow to give parity to female athletes.</p>
        <p>The event is the pole vault, one of the sport's toughest challenges. Several recent decisions by ruling bodies have led to widespread sanctioning of the women's pole vault, validating the efforts of such national-class athletes as Melissa Price, Pam Reynolds and Philipa Raschker.</p>
        <p>Last month, Oregon became the first state to approve pole-vaulting for girls as a standard event in high school programs. Next month, California is expected to follow.</p>
        <p>Thirteen other states, including New York and New Jersey, have indicated in a national high school federation survey that they would permit girls who wanted to pole-vault to do so in boys' events.</p>
        <p>In March, the women's vault will be added as an exhibition event to the program at the U.S./Mobil national indoor meet in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>"I love flying through the air," said Price, a 17-year-old high school senior from Kingsburg, Calif., who is the top-ranked American and United States record-holder with a mark of 11 feet 6 1/4 inches from 1994.</p>
        <p>Price, who attends Kingsburg High and has vaulted 12-6 in practice this season, will compete for the first time indoors this weekend in Reno. Price hopes to shatter her record at the meet, where more than 200 pole-vaulters are expected, including 25 women, the largest women's field ever assembled.</p>
        <p>"I would love to better 13 feet," said Price, a former gymnast who took up pole-vaulting to try to better her father's performance when he was in school. She has done just that. Now Price can aim for the world record.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the sport's governing body, the International Amateur Athletic Federation, based in Monte Carlo, announced that it would recognize world records in the women's pole vault. The indoor record, 13 feet 4 1/2 inches, was set last year by Nicole Rieger, 22, of Germany.</p>
        <p>But according to athletes and coaches, the 13-foot range is only a temporary milestone. "Women are capable of 16 to 17 feet," said Rick Baggett, coach of the Willamette Striders Pole Vault Club in Portland, Ore.</p>
        <p>The first male to vault 16 feet was in 1962, when the fiberglass pole was introduced. The current men's world records are 20-1 3/4 inches (indoors) and 20-2 1/4 inches (outdoors), both held by Sergei Bubka of Ukraine.</p>
        <p>Women were kept out of the pole vault because officials considered it too difficult or dangerous for them. Pole-vaulting requires speed, strength, agility and courage.</p>
        <p>"There are no differences training men and women vaulters," Baggett said.</p>
        <p>In track and field, there are 22 standard individual events. In recent years, women have gained events like the 10,000 meters and the triple jump, and now compete in virtually the same program as men do. And there has been talk about changing the women's heptathlon into a decathlon, which has the pole vault.</p>
        <p>Reynolds, 30, the fifth-ranked American woman, will also compete this weekend in Reno. Reynolds, a Penn State graduate and former high-school coach, moved to Portland to train with Baggett, who coaches almost 200 men, women and children and has converted his spacious backyard into a training center.</p>
        <p>"It's neat to be a pioneer," Reynolds said. "There's been a tremendous surge of women vaulters. And Rick's facility is awesome."</p>
        <p>On Baggett's property is a full-sized pole-vaulting runway and pit, along with gymnastics apparatus and a weight room converted from a barn. Baggett coaches 18-footers like Ron Johnson and Garth Willard, 10-footers like Reynolds and 12-year-olds who take classes and show up for Sunday "vault barbecues" with their parents.</p>
        <p>"About 20 percent of my kids are girls," Baggett said. "Three years ago when I started, I had none."</p>
        <p>The closest thing to Baggett's operation anywhere in the world is the Sergei Bubka Pole Vault School in Bubka's home city of Donyetsk, where scores of boys, but no girls, practice every day as American kids would shoot baskets.</p>
        <p>With the Summer Olympics in Atlanta next year, the pole-vaulting explosion is very likely to continue. This year, women will be able to vault for the first time at the indoor and outdoor high school national championships in Syracuse and Raleigh, N.C., respectively.</p>
        <p>Price can look forward to other major events. The I.A.A.F. is considering the event for its world championships in 1997. A women's pole vault is already on the card at the world masters championships, which will be held in Buffalo this summer.</p>
        <p>Raschker, a 47-year-old accountant from Marietta, Ga., has captured three world titles in the pole vault in her age group and has a best mark of 11-1. Raschker, the Jackie Joyner-Kersee of Masters track and field, has won dozens of other national and world titles in the sprints, hurdles, jumps and heptathlon.</p>
        <p>"Women are still learning the vault," Raschker said. "There's no doubt we will see 16 feet and better in the near future."</p>
        <p>There are now an estimated 60 countries that conduct a women's pole vault, according to an I.A.A.F. spokeswoman, Anna Legnani, who said by phone from Monte Carlo, Monaco, that the event would probably be included in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</p>
        <p>But there is still no women's pole vault in American colleges. "We want to wait a couple of years to see how it develops on the high school level," said Georgetown Coach Frank Gagliano, president of the N.C.A.A. Track and Field Coaches Association.</p>
        <p>Two of America's four pole manufacturers, Gill and Port-a-Pit, now make poles designed for women. These poles are shorter, with less diameter and density and they bend easier and at a lower point than the men's models.</p>
        <p>World-class male vaulters typically use 17-foot poles. Women are vaulting with poles around 12 or 13 feet. But there is some debate as to whether women really need different poles.</p>
        <p>Price, at 5 feet 2 inches and 123 pounds, prefers a standard pole; she likes its stiffness. Price thinks she has gained power from weight training and will vault on a new, longer pole in Reno in her record attempt.</p>
