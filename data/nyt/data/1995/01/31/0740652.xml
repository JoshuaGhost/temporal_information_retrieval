        <p>Richard Lowell Neas, an interior designer and decorative painter known for his lyrical trompe l'oeil murals, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. He was 67.</p>
        <p>The cause was cancer, Dennis W. O'Brien, his partner and longtime companion, said.</p>
        <p>Born in Independence, Mo., Mr. Neas studied at the Art Institute in Kansas City, Mo. There, he began to specialize in the decorative craft of trompe l'oeil, or illusionistic painting, creating architectural and garden scenes on the walls and ceilings of rooms.</p>
        <p>One of his early commissions, in the late 70's from the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, was to recreate the interior of London's 16th-century Globe Theatre. The model of the theater, which was the same size as the original, is still included in a traveling exhibition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neas created decorative paintings for such private clients as Gloria Vanderbilt Cooper, Nelson Doubleday, Annette de la Renta, John Hay Whitney, and Jane and Charles Engelhard.</p>
        <p>For the last 27 years, Mr. Neas also worked as an interior designer. His work was seen six times in the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Showhouse. In 1984, Mr. Neas was chosen to design a suite of rooms for Queen Elizabeth II when she visited a private home in Versailles, Ky.</p>
        <p>Both of Mr. Neas's homes, a 1920's house in Amagansett, L.I., and an 18th-century rectory that he restored in the Perigord region of France, were widely pictured in European and American magazines.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Neas is survived by a sister, Norma Waitman of Lee's Summit, Mo.; a half-sister, Louise Chaney, of Escondido, Calif., and two half-brothers, Dixon Kepley of Anaheim, Calif., and Edmond Kepley of Independence.</p>
