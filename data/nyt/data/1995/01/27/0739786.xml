        <p>In an unusually blunt admission, Germany's Roman Catholic bishops have stated that Catholics share responsibility for the Nazi Holocaust.</p>
        <p>The bishops deplored the failure of German Catholics to act against Nazism, and asserted that they now bear a special responsibility to speak out against anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>"The denial and guilt that was prevalent in those days also came from the church," the bishops said in a statement. "During the period of the Third Reich, Christians did not carry out the required resistance to racist anti-Semitism."</p>
        <p>Christians and Jews welcomed the bishops' statement, which was issued on Tuesday in advance of the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp on Friday.</p>
        <p>"There has never been such a clear recognition of guilt and its consequences for the Catholic Church and for Christians," said Ansgar Koschel, general secretary of the Association for Christian-Jewish Cooperation.</p>
        <p>A leading Catholic theologian, Johann-Baptist Metz, said there was "a new quality" in the statement, and predicted that it would inspire "Christian moral courage."</p>
        <p>The Auschwitz anniversary is being observed in Germany with seminars and public events. More than 400 specialists from Germany and abroad are holding a weeklong conference in Hamburg to discuss "the roots of Nazi mass murder" and to encourage Germans to defend the rights of minorities. The President of Germany, Roman Herzog, went to Poland to take part in ceremonies today at the site of the Auschwitz camp.</p>
        <p>Catholic bishops here had hoped to issue their acknowledgment of Catholic guilt together with bishops from Poland, but they were unable to agree on a text. Some Polish Catholic leaders have angered Jews by refusing to acknowledge what Jews say is the singularity of their suffering at Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>The German statement began: "The overwhelming majority of the prisoners and victims at this camp were Jews. For that reason, Auschwitz is the symbol of the destruction of European Jewry."</p>
        <p>"There was much denial and guilt among Catholics," the bishops said. "More than a few allowed themselves to be taken in by National Socialist ideology, and remained indifferent to crimes against Jewish life and property. Others supported the commission of crimes or even became criminals themselves.</p>
        <p>"The number of those who were outraged by the disappearance of their Jewish neighbors but could not find the courage to protest is unknown. Those who helped, even at the cost of their own lives, were often alone."</p>
        <p>"It weighs heavily upon us," the statement continued, "to know that there were only isolated initiatives on behalf of persecuted Jews, and that even after the pogroms of 1938 there was no clear public protest when hundreds of synagogues were burned and destroyed, cemeteries were desecrated, thousands of Jewish businesses were demolished, countless Jewish homes were attacked and plundered, and people were insulted, mistreated and even killed."</p>
        <p>German newspapers welcomed the bishops' statement, though some said it was long overdue. "The acknowledgement of anti-Semitism in the 2,000-year-old church, and the admission that Christians did not undertake the required resistance to anti-Semitism during the Third Reich, has never before been so clearly stated," wrote the newspaper Rheinische Post.</p>
        <p>Newspapers in other European countries also praised the German bishops. "There has never been such radical self-criticism from an institution of the church," Il Messaggero of Rome said. "As early as 1975, German bishops asked whether Catholics had shown the necessary courage in the face of the Holocaust. Twenty years later, the bishops themselves now provide an answer: no, they did not. This should help ease relations with Jews in the wake of the debate over the Christian convent and Christian symbols at Auschwitz."</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the German bishops, Heike Thome, said the statement was intended to be "a cry against forgetting, an appeal for reflection and remembrance."</p>
