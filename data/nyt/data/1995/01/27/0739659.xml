        <p>NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM MAY EXPAND</p>
        <p>The American Museum of Natural History, dogged by a reputation for stodginess despite recent renovations, is planning a major reconstruction and expansion intended to bring it into the realm of the latest generation of interactive science museums. The centerpiece of the plan is a huge sphere that would replace the 59-year-old Hayden Planetarium. A1. NEW YORK CITY</p>
        <p>COLLEGE PRESIDENT FAULTED ON SPENDING</p>

B3. JURY IS CHOSEN FOR CONSPIRACY TRIAL</p>
        <p>A jury including a letter carrier, two people who work with computers, a transit worker and an accountant was selected in the terror conspiracy trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 others. B3. ADVOCATE OF CIVIL RIGHTS DISBARRED</p>

        <p>An untrained police department bungled the 1991 investigation into the murder of a Westchester infant in the care of a Swiss nanny, failing to take such steps as examining the charred plastic seat where the baby died and a cloth soaked in lighter fluid found near the nanny's bed, a state commission has concluded. B5. CORNELL PROFESSOR FACES SANCTIONS</p>

But the number of jobs fell far below the number he used during the campaign. B4. WHITMAN TAKES BUDGET ON ROAD</p>
