        <p>A broad smile creased Nick Faldo's face as he heard the question. He was clearly amused. Asked how his departure from the PGA European Tour -- and his decision to play full time in America on the PGA Tour -- was greeted by his European peers, Faldo began to chuckle.</p>

        <p>A broad smile creased Nick Faldo's face as he heard the question. He was clearly amused. Asked how his departure from the PGA European Tour -- and his decision to play full time in America on the PGA Tour -- was greeted by his European peers, Faldo began to chuckle.</p>
        <p>"They all just waved," he said, mimicking an exaggerated hand wave. " 'Bye-bye. Just go,' I think they said. 'How long are you staying? Great!' "</p>
        <p>He'll be staying all year. For the first time since he resigned from the PGA Tour after the 1989 season, Faldo is back. The great experiment begins this week at the Northern Telecom Open. Starting over, looking for a new challenge, he is searching for a way to recapture the metronomic consistency that made him, for a period of 81 weeks until January of last year, the world's No. 1 golfer.</p>
        <p>After going two years without winning a major championship, Faldo, 37, now feels the sense of urgency that shadows all aging athletes. He has slipped to No. 3 in the world, and he has decided that the only way to test whether or not he is the player he once was is to come here and play in 17 tournaments.</p>
        <p>"It's something new to get your teeth into," is how he explained it. "You know, go for it, see what happens. That's what I'm going to do."</p>
        <p>When he is relaxed and at peace with himself, Faldo can be an amusing and engaging fellow. This facet of his personality is often overlooked by those who see him as merely a driven, inhuman robot -- a mechanical man who measures everything against his golf game and his quixotic quest to subdue and perfect it.</p>
        <p>That side of Faldo, the consummate perfectionist, has not endeared him to his rivals, home or abroad. But there is a sense of acceptance among the PGA Tour players, some of whom seem to realize that his presence can only enhance the Tour, both in terms of marquee value and increased level of competition.</p>
        <p>"I'm glad he's going to play here," Paul Azinger said during last week's United Airlines Hawaiian Open. "It's another chance to go head to head. Some of the players who competed against him at the Ryder Cup might be excited to go up against him again.</p>
        <p>"Plus, it would be great if some of the younger players on tour saw his work ethic. It might rub off on them."</p>
        <p>Faldo has chosen this difficult route, leaving his wife and children back in England and setting up a rented home in Orlando to be close to his instructor, David Leadbetter, because there are holes to be filled in his record. It is costing Faldo more than $1 million in European appearance fees alone to be here, but he couldn't care less about that.</p>
        <p>All he cares about is winning now. This is the man who was emerging as the king of the major championships. During one stretch that began with his second-place finish at the 1988 United States Open, Faldo went five years without finishing outside the top 20 in a major. In that stretch, he won four of his five major championships and had nine finishes in the top five.</p>
        <p>It was a heady run. He was not merely No. 1 in the Sony Rankings, he was anointed as the top player in the world by Jack Nicklaus, the man who inspired him to take up the game. He was named a Member of the British Empire by the Queen, the modern day equivalent of being knighted. A wax likeness of him was made for Madame Tussaud's in London.</p>
        <p>There was talk that Faldo could become the first golfer in history to actually win the Masters, the United States Open, the British Open and the P.G.A. Championship in the same year -- the Grand Slam, the Impregnable Quadrilateral. And this talk wasn't mere persiflage. Serious-minded people believed it was possible.</p>
        <p>It hasn't happened, of course. His victory in the 1992 British Open at Muirfield was his last major title. Now, Faldo realizes that to win the two majors that have eluded him, the United States Open and the P.G.A. Championship, his best chance is to prepare here in the States, on greens that are consistently fast and true and at courses with superior practice facilities. His schedule leading up to the Masters is formidable, eight tournaments between now and Augusta, with four on the West Coast swing and all four Florida stops.</p>
        <p>From a technical standpoint, his game is in good shape. He played extremely well at the season-ending Johnnie Walker World Championship at Jamaica in December, tying for second. His control over the golf ball that week was excellent, and he says it has remained so in the month since that event. His switch to a cross-handed putting stroke last year has served him well. He is confident on the greens again.</p>
        <p>"I know that on most of the golf courses over here you have to be aggressive," Faldo said. "You've got to go out and fire at the pin. You've got to think about piling up the numbers. I think I'm a more aggressive player than I've been given credit for."</p>
        <p>Time will tell. The last time Faldo played full time over here, from 1981 through 1989, he had only victories in the 1984 Sea Pines Heritage Classic and the 1989 Masters to show for it. He wasn't the player then that he ultimately became, but lately he hasn't been that player, either.</p>
        <p>He yearns to be that man again. "I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't have the desire," he said. "This is a serious commitment, to be over here, away from my family. Everybody is making sacrifices. I think there's still plenty of fire in there."  GOLF</p>
