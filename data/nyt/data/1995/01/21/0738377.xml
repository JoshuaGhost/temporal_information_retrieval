        <p>Alan and Linda Fingerman of Little Neck, L.I., want their children, Stacey, 9, and Kenneth, 7, to get in the habit of saving money. When they discovered the Bank for Kids program of the Republic National Bank of New York, they encouraged their children to sign up. After the children made initial deposits of moeny saved from birthday gifts and other sources, the parents began to give them a weekly allowance in exchange for doing certain chores.</p>
        <p>Following the guidelines of the book "Money Doesn't Grow on Trees," by Neal Godfrey, the parents told the children to put 36 percent of their weekly income into the bank for long-term goals and to pay 15 percent to the family as a "tax," or money to be used by the whole family. In this case, it was earmarked for the purchase of a family car. The children could spend the remainder as they chose. Besides making it easy for children to save, the Republic Bank program makes saving fun, Mr. Fingerman said, with regular newsletters, performances and contests.</p>
