        <p>If a violinist has good hands and a sharp mind, age is irrelevant, in the view of JOSEPH FUCHS. He should know: at 94, he is still performing and teaching. And on Wednesday evening, the Juilliard School celebrated his forthcoming 95th birthday (on April 26) with a concert.</p>
        <p>Dozens of Mr. Fuchs's present and former students assembled to play or listen. Mr. Fuchs, who started studying at the school in 1907, still teaches there three times a week.</p>

        <p>If a violinist has good hands and a sharp mind, age is irrelevant, in the view of JOSEPH FUCHS. He should know: at 94, he is still performing and teaching. And on Wednesday evening, the Juilliard School celebrated his forthcoming 95th birthday (on April 26) with a concert.</p>
        <p>Dozens of Mr. Fuchs's present and former students assembled to play or listen. Mr. Fuchs, who started studying at the school in 1907, still teaches there three times a week.</p>
        <p>"Whatever I was endowed with, both the left hand and the right hand are still working," he said yesterday.  "So is the equipment in my head. Today, people talk about younger artists all the time, but experience only comes from trial and error all your life. More attention should be paid to people who have accumulated a lifetime of experience."</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuchs was more than a spectator at the event in his honor. He took to the stage to play the Bach Concerto in D Minor for Two Violins with GLENN DICTEROW, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic. "Most people put the violin down at 70 or 75, but he still sounds terrific," Mr. Dicterow said. "I jumped at the chance to play with him."</p>
