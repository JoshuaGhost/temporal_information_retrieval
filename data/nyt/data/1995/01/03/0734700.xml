        <p>Somewhere, undoubtedly, there is handwringing over the prospect of a big, deep bear market this year. Just as certainly, there are some market seers out there who expect very big things from the stock market in 1995.</p>
        <p>But Wall Street analysts in the mainstream expect the stock market to be shaky in the first half and better later, with market average hitting highs for the year in the fourth quarter. Most expect the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average to trade within a narrow 400-point range this year.</p>
        <p>Fearful of a bit of a bumpy ride during the first months of 1995, most strategists have less than half of their model portfolios invested in stocks, well below historic norms.</p>
        <p>As 1994 began, most of the anaysts surveyed here were nervous about the bond market. Few, however, expected things to get as bad as they did.</p>
        <p>"At the end of 1993, we were telling clients that stocks would dramatically outperform bonds, and they have," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chariman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. "At one point, the S.&amp; P. 500 index was flat, while bonds were down 30 percent."</p>
        <p>No one is expecting a rerun in 1995. Bond yields may well rise a bit more in the first half of the year, to as high as 8.5 percent, some say, before leveling off and declining by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>And in the face of continued strong growth in the economy, the Federal Reserve is expected to keep pushing up short-term interest rates.</p>
        <p>Albert Goldman, director of market analysis at A.G. Edwards Inc., predicts the Federal funds rate will peak at around 7.5 percent, two full percentage points above its current leve.</p>
        <p>Indeed, if there is a risk to what is generally seen as a solid if not glowing outlook for the stock market this year, it is that in its effort to rein in growth, the Fed might push interest rates too high, forcing the economy into recession.</p>
        <p>"If short-term interest rates go up by more than another percentage point, you rund the risk of greater dislocations, and more disasters like Orange County," said Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc.</p>
        <p>An overzealous response by the Fed to continued strong growth in the economy would be a big mistake, many of these strategists said, because inflation is not likely to be a problem in 1995. Consumer prices will probably go up a little over the course of the year but will not rise much above an annualized rate of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, they said.</p>
        <p>At the moment, Wall Street does not see much chance of lawmakers in Washington creating a furor in the debt and stock markets by passing tax cuts that would vastly inflate the Federal budget deficit.</p>
        <p>"The budget rules and political dynamics are vastly different now than they were in the 1980's," said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief investment strategist at the CS First Boston Corporation.</p>
        <p>"Is the Federal deficit likely to change enough - eith good or bad - to significantly reprice stocks, bonds or the dollar? No."  OUTLOOK 1995: MARKETS &amp; INVESTING  Correction:  January 7, 1995, Saturday</p>
        <p>A chart on Tuesday in the special Outlook '95 section of Business Day about investment strategies by seven stock market analysts misstated a prediction by one analyst. David Holt, a portfolio strategist at Wedbush Morgan Securities, expects the Dow Jones industrial average to rise as high as 3,900 this year, not 3,700.</p>
