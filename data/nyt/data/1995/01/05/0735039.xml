        <p>In what amounted to a public acknowledgment that after six years it had failed to blend its Kraft and General Foods operations, the Philip Morris Companies announced yesterday that it would merge its lagging food businesses into a single reorganized company, to be known as Kraft Foods.</p>
        <p>In dissolving its Kraft U.S.A. and General Foods U.S.A. units, which together make up the nation's largest food company, Philip Morris will create a new food operation with 55,000 employees, 3,500 of them in the sales force. The consolidation will begin in April and continue for several years.</p>
        <p>No operations will be closed, but about 100 management jobs will be eliminated, according to the company. Eventually, additional jobs will be pared through attrition and retirement, according to Robert S. Morrison, who will head the reorganized company.</p>
        <p>Philip Morris acquired General Foods in 1985 and bought Kraft in 1988. Yesterday's sweeping merger announcement "was something you would have thought would have been done early on, but it's never too late," said Emanuel Goldman, a securities analyst for Paine Webber.</p>
        <p>The move came three weeks after Philip Morris reshuffled its senior management team and announced the planned sale of its Kraft Foodservice divisions for an estimated $700 million. In February, Geoffrey C. Bible will become the company's chairman, keeping his roles as president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>"It shows that Bible was quite unhappy with the performance of the food business," Mr. Goldman said. "They are a massive presence in supermarkets, but they haven't capitalized on that enough."</p>
        <p>In December, the company also announced that James M. Kilts, 46, formerly a group vice president of Kraft U.S.A., would occupy the new post of executive vice president of worldwide food for Philip Morris Inc., reporting to Mr. Bible. Mr. Morrison will report to Mr. Kilts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrison, 52, who was chairman and chief executive of Kraft General Foods North America, the corporate umbrella for the food businesses, will head the new Kraft Foods from the Northfield, Ill., headquarters of the former Kraft General Foods.</p>
        <p>The consolidation was well received on Wall Street. Philip Morris stock closed up $1.25 yesterday, at $58.875, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>The move "is a positive development for Philip Morris, but investors will evaluate the company in terms of how well its domestic and international tobacco operations perform," said Terry Bivens, a securities analyst with Argus Research. "The stock is still selling at a depressed level due to litigation concerns."</p>
        <p>The performance of the Philip Morris food operations has been lackluster, compared with those of RJR Nabisco, Mr. Bivens said. In the first nine months of 1994, he said, Philip Morris's profit margins from food operations were 12.6 percent, compared with 14.4 percent for the RJR food businesses.</p>
        <p>The Kraft General Foods name was "confusing to our customers and employees as well," Mr. Morrison said.</p>
        <p>"People would call us Kraft, or Kraft General. We needed a unifying name," he said.</p>
        <p>No change is being considered in the Kraft consumer-products logo, he said, adding that the Kraft name had been chosen because "it is a highly regarded brand in just about every home in the United States," whereas the General Foods name "did not have consumer appeal."</p>
        <p>The reorganization will enable logistics staff, distribution managers, and marketing and information employees to work better together, Mr. Morrison said.</p>
        <p>For example, the company recently introduced a new product, Jell-O Yogurt, in California. The yogurt unit was in Illinois and the Jell-O managers were in White Plains "and it has been hard to coordinate across hundreds of miles," Mr. Morrison said. "Now they'll be one group," he added.</p>
        <p>The reorganization will also merge five different groups in the company's sales force of 3,500, which the company said was the largest direct sales force of any United States company.</p>
        <p>Before, "in any territory you'd have two people visiting supermarkets, fighting for spaces in the parking lot and vying for time with the store manager," Mr. Morrison said. "Now the store managers can get to know one person." The excess employees will cover more territories and be retrained to represent a wider range of products.</p>
        <p>Management offices in the former General Foods headquarters in White Plains and the former Kraft headquarters in Glenview, Ill., will be retained, and many brands will continue to be managed from their old offices. But to maximize efficiencies, Mr. Morrison said, some brands will be shifted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrison would not specify how much employment would be reduced through attrition and retirement, except to say that "we will make our employee base more productive." The company has "no current plans" to consolidate the White Plains and Glenview operations, he said. "But in this world it's impossible to say the word 'never.' "</p>
