        <p>Manchester United suspended ERIC CANTONA, the striker who was last season's Premier League player of the year, yesterday for kicking and punching a fan during a match on Wednesday. France also dropped Cantona, its captain, from the national team.</p>
        <p>Cantona jumped into the stands at Crystal Palace and aimed a two-footed kick at a spectator who had been taunting him. Cantona then punched the fan, MATTHEW SIMMONS, before being restrained by officials and teammates. Simmons has been banned from the stadium.</p>
        <p>The club also fined Cantona the maximum sum permissible under his contract, reportedly $32,000. Cantona will miss 16 league games as United -- currently second in the Premier League standing -- tries to retain the league title it has won for the past two seasons.</p>
        <p>The suspension comes amid speculation that Cantona may be transferred to the Italian club Inter Milan. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: SOCCER</p>
