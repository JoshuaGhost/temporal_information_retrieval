        <p>Their last bout may have ended in a controversial decision last June, but when VINNY PAZIENZA and ROBERTO DURAN meet again for a supermiddleweight pay-per-view rematch at the Atlantic City Convention Center on Saturday night, the outcome will be clear-cut, both boxers predicted yesterday.</p>
        <p>"I'm going to make this kid pay," is the way Duran, 43, put it at a news conference in New York. Speaking through an interpreter at Scores, the East 60th Street club owned by the bout's promoter, MICHAEL BLUTRICH, Duran was philosophical about his loss last June, only the 10th in a 104-bout career. "I thought it was a very bad decision," he said, "but what can you do about it?"</p>

"I thought it was a very bad decision," he said, "but what can you do about it?"</p>
        <p>For his part, Pazienza, 31, was exuding confidence, already looking beyond Duran to a title fight against ROY JONES Jr., the International Boxing Federation's impressive new super middleweight champion, and even beyond Jones to an eventual bout as a heavyweight.</p>
        <p>"I think it would be exciting to fight someone who might be able to hurt me," said Pazienza, suggesting that he could be hurt by no one less than a heavyweight, certainly not by Duran.  SPORTS PEOPLE: BOXING</p>
