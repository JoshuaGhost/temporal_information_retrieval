        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"The Gingrich Paradox" (editorial, Jan. 5) expresses some doubts about the genuineness of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's suddenly discovered bipartisanship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich, of course, is an extremely shrewd politician and probably knows better than most of his Republican colleagues that the contradictions in his Contract With America are going to force him into an attempt to co-opt as many Democrats as possible. Not so much to share in the glory but in the ultimate blame for the debacle that his contract will cause.</p>
        <p>I hope, not just for the Democrats, but also for the country as a whole, that he will not find too many "co-optees" within all levels of the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Everybody is talking about a "landslide" in the 1994 Congressional elections. Thirty-nine percent of eligible voters split their vote between Republicans and Democrats, 51 percent to 49 percent. This translates into less than 20 percent of eligible voters. Some landslide!</p>
        <p>I hope that the Democrats will concentrate their ultimate efforts on persuading a large enough percentage of those threatened by the contract to vote in 1996, so that the mini-landslide can be reversed.</p>
        <p>At the same time no one should underestimate Mr. Gingrich's mastery of tactical politics. The fight will be difficult and treacherous. I hope that President Clinton will be up to it. CHARLES A. LAWNER  Tarrytown, N.Y., Jan. 6, 1995</p>
