        <p>A Familiar Symbiosis Between Diva and Her Fans  Montserrat Caballe, soprano</p>
        <p>Carnegie Hall</p>
        <p>It met all the qualifications for a diva evening: nostalgic repertory, thunderous if uncritical affection and frequent changes of clothing. Montserrat Caballe sang for her fans on Thursday evening. The New Jersey Symphony was onstage with her. Jose Collado conducted.</p>
        <p>A familiar symbiosis was at work. As far as Miss Caballe's admirers are concerned, she can do no wrong; so when she occasionally did, no one chose to notice. The soprano voice is still big after its many years of use, but almost necessarily some of the luxury has worn away. With gloriousness of timbre less able to distract our attention, Miss Caballe's odd mannerisms become more pronounced: the startling sudden fortes, the near inaudibility of her equally sudden pianissimos, the swoops of portamento, the frequent flirtations with flatness and sharpness.</p>
        <p>At moments Miss Caballe still sounds formidable, although I enjoyed the singing in the "Salce, salce" from Verdi's "Otello" and Boito's "L'altra notte" more than I did the musicality of the singing. (Thursday's audience seemed to love both.) If the other items from Rossini, Cilea and Verdi also seemed more about a legendary voice than legendary music drama, the zarzuela arias at the end by Chapi, Serrano and Nieto were natural, unselfconscious and an unalloyed delight.</p>
        <p>Working hard with a good but evidently under-rehearsed orchestra, Mr. Collado did some splendid roof-raising in Gimenez's Interlude from "La boda de Luis Alonso." The Overtures to Rossini's "L'Italiana in Algeri" and Verdi's "Forza del destino" were heartfelt but makeshift. BERNARD HOLLAND</p>
