        <p>It was scarcely over a year ago when Peter Leko fulfilled his credentials for grandmaster rank at the earliest age in history, 14 years, 9 months. In late March, the precocious Hungarian advanced his career another signal step by winning outright for the first time in high-level competition.</p>
        <p>Leko captured first place in the Copenhagen International Tournament with an 8-3 score, surpassing seven grandmasters and four international masters in an event held to celebrate the 60th jubilee of the Bronshoi Skak Forening club. He went undefeated and finished a point ahead of his closest rival, the Ukrainian international master Andrei Maksimenko.</p>

        <p>It was scarcely over a year ago when Peter Leko fulfilled his credentials for grandmaster rank at the earliest age in history, 14 years, 9 months. In late March, the precocious Hungarian advanced his career another signal step by winning outright for the first time in high-level competition.</p>
        <p>Leko captured first place in the Copenhagen International Tournament with an 8-3 score, surpassing seven grandmasters and four international masters in an event held to celebrate the 60th jubilee of the Bronshoi Skak Forening club. He went undefeated and finished a point ahead of his closest rival, the Ukrainian international master Andrei Maksimenko.</p>
        <p>Leko is following the path of Anatoly Karpov, who became mature without going through a wild shoot-'em-up Sturm und Drang period. In his Round 7 Game with the aggressive Swedish grandmaster Jonny Hector, it was Leko whose precise play destroyed his 31-year-old opponent's rambunctious gambit.</p>
        <p>Leko met the chancy King's Gambit with the defense Bobby Fischer recommended many years ago: 2 . . . ef 3 Nf3 d6 4 d4 g5 5 h4 g4 6 Ng1 (the wild 6 Ng5 is put down by 6 . . . f6 7 Bf4 fg 8 Bg5 Be7 9 Qd2 Be6 10 Nc3 Nd7), but in place of 6 . . . Bh6 7 Ne2 (7 Nc3 c6 8 Nge2 Qf6 9 g3 f3 10 Nf4 is another well-known way to produce difficult play) Qf6 8 Nbc3 Ne7 9 Qd2 Nbc6 10 g3 Bd7, which is not clear, Leko came up with an interesting innovation in this specific situation, 6 . . . f5!?, to break up the white center.</p>
        <p>Capturing with 7 ef to avoid guarding this pawn would not suffice after 7 . . . Qe7! 8 Be2 Bf5 9 Bf4 Qe4 10 Qd2 Nc6!, which forces White to lose material.</p>
        <p>On 7 Nc3 Nf6, lunging with 8 e5 would be incisively turned back by 8 . . . de 9 de Qd1 10 Kd1 Nh5 11 Nd5 Ng3! 12 Nc7 Kd8 13 Na8 Nh1 14 Bf4 Be6 15 Ke1 Bc5 16 Ne2 Nc6 17 Rd1 Kc8. The black knight will escape; the white one won't. So Black will have a piece more.</p>
        <p>After 8 Bf4 fe, it may well be that 9 d5!?, preventing Black from linking up his pawns by 9 . . . d5, was worth trying. Anyway, routine development with 9 Qd2 gave Hector nothing after 9 . . . d5 10 Be5 c6. Indeed, the powerful black center formed a perfect barrier against attack.</p>
        <p>Hector's 14 Ne3 was nicely parried by Leko's 14 . . . Ne5! 15 de Qc7! The supporting tactical point was that after 16 Qc3 O-O-O 17 O-O-O Nh5, 18 e6? could have been crushed by 18 . . . Bg7 19 Qd2 Qf4 20 ef Bh6 21 Re1 d4 22 Nc4 Qf6, which wins heavy material.</p>
        <p>After 20 . . . Kb8, it was evident that the opening was a failure for White. Hector squirmed around with 21 Qg5 Rhg8 22 Qf5 Bg6 23 Qg5 Rde8 24 Qg4, but although he avoided the loss of a second pawn, his situation was hopeless after 24 . . . Qe5.</p>
        <p>Exchanging queens with 25 Qg5 Qg5 26 hg threw Hector into a lost endgame, but keeping them on would see Leko begin a mighty mating attack with . . . e3 and . . . d4.</p>
        <p>After 28 . . . Ne6, Hector had no stomach for the two-pawns-down ending resulting from 29 Ng6 (or 29 Ne6 Re6, followed by 30 . . . Re5 and 31 . . . Rg5) hg 30 Be2 Ng5. The Swedish grandmaster gave up.</p>
