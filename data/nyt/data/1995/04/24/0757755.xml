        <p>Following are excerpts from remarks by President Clinton, the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham and Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma yesterday at a memorial service in Oklahoma City for victims of the bombing of the Federal office building last Wednesday. The President's remarks were recorded by The Associated Press and Dr. Graham's and Governor Keating's remarks by The New York Times.  President Clinton</p>
        <p>Today our nation joins with you in grief. We mourn with you. We share your hope against hope that some may still survive. We thank all those who have worked so heroically to save lives and to solve this crime, those here in Oklahoma and those who are all across this great land, and many who left their own lives to come here to work, hand-in-hand, with you.</p>
        <p>We pledge to do all we can to help you heal the injured, to rebuild this city and to bring to justice those who did this evil.</p>
        <p>This terrible sin took the lives of our American family, innocent children in that building only because their parents were trying to be good parents as well as good workers; citizens in the building going about their daily business; and many there who served the rest of us, who worked to help the elderly and the disabled, who worked to support our farmers and our veterans, who worked to enforce our laws and to protect us.</p>
        <p>Let us say clearly they served us well and we are grateful.</p>
        <p>But for so many of you, they were also neighbors and friends. You saw them at church, or the P.T.A. meetings, at the civic clubs or the ball park. You know them in ways that all the rest of America could not. And to all the members of the families here present who have suffered loss, though we share your grief, your pain is unimaginable and we know that. We cannot undo it. That is God's work.</p>
        <p>Our words seem small beside the loss you have endured, but I found a few I wanted to share today. I have received a lot of letters in these last terrible days. One stood out because it came from a young widow and a mother of three whose own husband was murdered with over 200 other Americans when Pan Am 103 was shot down. Here is what that woman said I should say to you today.</p>
        <p>"The anger you feel is valid but you must not allow yourselves to be consumed by it. The hurt you feel must not be allowed to turn into hate, but instead into the search for justice. The loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives. Instead, you must try to pay tribute to your loved ones by continuing to do all the things they left undone, thus insuring they did not die in vain."</p>
        <p>Wise words from one who also knows.</p>
        <p>You have lost too much but you have not lost everything, and you have certainly not lost America, for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes.</p>
        <p>If ever we needed evidence of that, I could only recall the words of Governor and Mrs. Keating, "If anybody thinks that Americans are mostly mean and selfish, they ought to come to Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>"If anybody thinks Americans have lost the capacity for love, and caring, and courage, they ought to come to Oklahoma."</p>
        <p>To all my fellow Americans beyond this hall I say one thing we owe those who have sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil.</p>
        <p>They are forces that threaten our common peace, our freedom, our way of life. Let us teach our children that the God of comfort is also the God of righteousness. Those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind. Justice will prevail.</p>
        <p>Let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear. When there is talk of hatred, let us stand up and talk against it. When there is talk of violence, let us stand up and talk against it. In the face of death let us honor life.</p>
        <p>As St. Paul admonished us, "Let us not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."</p>
        <p>Yesterday Hillary and I had the privilege of speaking with some children of other Federal employees, children like those who were lost here. And one little girl said something we will never forget. She said, "We should all plant a tree in memory of the children." So this morning before we got on the plane to come here, at the White House, we planted that tree in honor of the children of Oklahoma.</p>
        <p>It was a dogwood with its wonderful spring flower and its deep enduring roots. It embodies the lesson of the Psalms that the life of a good person is like a tree whose leaf does not wither.</p>
        <p>My fellow Americans, a tree takes a long time to grow, and wounds take a long time to heal, but we must begin. Those who are lost now belong to God. Some say we will be with them, but until that happens, their legacy must be our lives.</p>
        <p>Thank you all and God bless you.  Dr. Graham</p>
        <p>I have been asked the question several times, many times: Why does God allow it? Why does a God of love and mercy that we read about and hear about allow such a terrible thing to happen?</p>
        <p>Over 3,000 years ago, there was a man named Job who struggled with the same question. He asked why, because he was a good man and yet disaster struck him suddenly and swiftly. He lost seven sons, three daughters. He lost all his possessions. He even lost his health. Even his wife and his friends turned against him. His wife said: Curse God and die. And in the midst of his suffering he asked this question: Why? Job didn't know. Why did I not perish at birth, he cried.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this is the way you feel. And I want to assure you that God understands those feelings.</p>
        <p>The Bible says in Isaiah 43:2: When you pass through the waters, I will be with you. And when you walk through the fire, you will not be burned. The flames will not set you ablaze.</p>
        <p>And, yet, Job found there were lessons to be learned from his suffering even if he didn't fully understand it. And that is true for all of us as well.</p>
        <p>What are some of the lessons that we can learn from what has happened?</p>
        <p>First, there's a mystery to it. I've been asked why God allows it. I don't now. I can't give a direct answer. I have to confess that I never fully understand even for my own satisfaction. I have to accept by faith that God is a God of love and mercy and compassion even in the midst of suffering. . . .</p>
        <p>The Bible says God is not the author of evil. And it speaks of evil in first Thessalonians as a mystery.</p>
        <p>There's something about evil we will never fully understand this side of eternity. But the Bible says two other things that we sometimes attempt to forget. It tells us that there is a devil, that Satan is very real and he has great power.</p>
        <p>It also tells us that evil is real and that the human heart is capable of almost limitless evil when it is cut off from God and from the moral law. But Father Jeremiah said the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Who can know it. That's your heart and my heart without God.</p>
        <p>That's one reason we each need God in our lives. For only He can change our hearts and give us the desire and the power to do what is right and keep us from wrong.</p>
        <p>At times like this, we'll do one of two things: It will either make us hard and bitter and angry at God, or they will make us tender and open and help us to reach out in trust and faith. And I think that's what the people of Oklahoma are doing that I have met since I've been here these past two days.</p>
        <p>I pray that you will not let bitterness and poison creep into your souls, but you will turn in faith and trust in God even if we cannot understand. It is better to face something like this with God than without Him.  Governor Keating</p>
        <p>Today we stand before the world and before our God together, our hearts and our hands linked in a solidarity these criminals can never understand. We stand together in love.</p>
        <p>We have seen the terrifying images and read the heart-rending stories. Some of us have lived them. The firefighters clutching the body of a sweet innocent child, the policeman reaching through rubble to grasp the hand of a victim, the volunteer stretcher bearers -- some black, some white, some brown -- all linked together in courage and compassion, rushing aid to the wounded, the healers embracing life, the mourners lamenting death, the endless lines of donors and helpers and givers, giving their labor, their hopes, their treasure, their very blood.</p>
        <p>Through all of this, through the tears, the righteous anger, the soul-rending sorrow, the immeasurable loss, we have sometimes felt alone. But we are never, ever truly alone. We have God and we have each other.</p>
        <p>Today we have our neighbors -- more than three million Oklahomans, and never have we drawn so close together. There is something special about our wonderful state. We have always known that. Now America does. Now the world does.</p>
        <p>Today we have our fellow Americans, from the power of our Federal relief and investigative agencies to the prayers of millions. They will bring us justice as they have already brought us hope, and we will be forever grateful for this outpouring of love and support.</p>
        <p>Today we have our families, so many of them torn apart by sorrow and hurt but families still, strong through the generations, stronger yet through this terrible ordeal.</p>
        <p>Today we have our heroes and we have our heroines, saints in gray and blue and whites and khakis -- the rescuers and the healers. They have labored long and nobly and they have cried with us.</p>
        <p>Today we have our leaders. Mr. President, Rev. Graham, we are moved by your presence. The warmth of your welcome may be dimmed by our tears, but it is one of deep gratitude. Thank you for coming to touch our lives.</p>
        <p>Today we have our children. Oklahoma is still a young state. And our young people are very special to us. We have been brutally reminded of how precious they are by the events of the last several days. For them, we reserve our warmest hugs and our gentlest touch.</p>
        <p>And today we have our God. He is not a God of your religion or mine, but of all people in all times. He is a God of love but he is also a God of justice. Today, He assures us, once again, that good is stronger than evil, that love is greater than hate, that each of us is His special child embraced by His father's love.</p>
        <p>Our pain is vast. Our loss is beyond measure. We cannot fathom this act, but we can reach beyond its horrible consequences.</p>
        <p>The thousands of us gathered here today are multiplied by God's love, anointed by His gentle mercy. Today we are one with Him and with one another.</p>
        <p>It is right for us to grieve. We have all been touched by this immense tragedy. And our sorrow is part of the healing process. For some of us stricken with intense personal loss, it will be a long and tortured path. For all of us, it is a journey through darkness. But darkness ends in the morning light. That is God's promise, and that is our hope.  TERROR IN OKLAHOMA</p>
