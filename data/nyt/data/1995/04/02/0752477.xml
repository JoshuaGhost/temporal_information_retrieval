        <p>TWIN lanes of cars pass along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and disappear beneath the wedge of the elevated John H. Finley Walk that curves close to East End Avenue.

        <p>TWIN lanes of cars pass along the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive and disappear beneath the wedge of the elevated John H. Finley Walk that curves close to East End Avenue. John Marshall's seventh-floor window looks out toward Astoria's low-level terrain to the east, the Queensboro Bridge to the south.</p>
        <p>He is unhappy about the lights on Roosevelt Island that dim the skies for his terrace telescopes, but Mr. Marshall, a widower retired from his job as a supervisor with the Singer Company, is otherwise pleased with his accommodations: a two-bedroom apartment he and his wife, Anna, rented in 1954 and bought, for a fraction of its current value, in 1960.</p>
        <p>"If I were to move," he said, "although I would make a huge paper profit, I would gain nothing -- because I wouldn't get anything as good as this."</p>
        <p>Susan Coleman, a lifelong neighborhood resident whose family has owned a delicatessen at 50 East End for 43 years, works behind the counter, where she holds customers' extra apartment keys and Federal Express or shopping packages.</p>
        <p>Her store, Ms. Coleman said, has been described as a "psyche-deli," because she ministers to emotional needs. "People come in and tell me all their troubles," she said. "We're very involved in people's lives."</p>
        <p>Monro Wines &amp; Spirits, the next block up, does likewise. Both proffer cab fare for East Enders arriving late with no small change. Such small-town customs, with little commercial traffic (there are two dry cleaners, a gift shop, a laundry and a Sloan's supermarket) afford upscale residents a virtual suburban lifestyle within Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Three or four decades ago, Ms. Coleman said, the neighborhood consisted largely of "small buildings and families with eight kids." Many of those people have relocated, she said, but side streets still contain rent-controlled and rent-stabilized railroad flats whose longtime tenants may pay less than $300 a month and live a wall away from recently arrived young professionals who pay $900 or more for the same type of unit.</p>
        <p>East End Avenue runs from 79th to 90th Street; it is part of the neighborhood of Yorkville, which was established by German immigrants in the late 18th century. Archibald Gracie built a mansion at what is now 88th Street in 1799; it is now the residence of New York City's Mayor. According to the urban historian Val Ginter, estates near Gracie Mansion owned by the Astor, Gracie, Rhinelander and Schermerhorn families were divided in the mid-19th century after the city created its street grid. Light industry (a lime yard, a cigar factory) was established in the late 19th century. Working-class tenements filled the side streets.</p>
        <p>In 1881, John C. Henderson built 32 Queen Anne red brick town houses for "persons of moderate means." The houses, most of them on East End between 86th and 87th Streets, run into a mews, Henderson Place, on 86th Street. Today the asking price for the renovated No. 146 is $1.495 million, according to Sieglinda G.-S. O'Donnell of the William B. May Company.</p>
        <p>The west side of the mews was leveled in 1961 for the 22-story luxury high-rise Henderson House at 535 East 86th Street; the remaining 24 houses attained landmark status in 1969. Henderson House "has no mortgage, therefore very low maintenance," said Barbara Freehill of the Corcoran Group: a second-floor, seven-room apartment has an asking price of $635,000; a seven-room penthouse with river views is $1.05 million.</p>
        <p>The East River Park, from 84th to 86th Street, was designed by Samuel Parsons of Vaux &amp; Parsons in 1876; it was expanded to 90th Street in 1891 and renamed Carl Schurz Park in 1911 for the German immigrant and statesman. The John H. Finley Walk, over the Franklin.D. Roosevelt Drive since 1941, serves as a promenade from 81st to 90th Street, continuing as a jogger's path along the river.</p>
        <p>Since the mid-1970's, the Carl Schurz Park Association has supplemented Parks Department maintenance by setting new drainage pipes and cherry trees in the mall, restoring entrances, stairways and a children's playground, and creating the Carl Dog Run two years ago.</p>
        <p>A dog subculture has grown up around the Run, where residents congregate and set their dogs to frolic.</p>
        <p>"SOME people consider this dull, but I'm at a stage in my life where I cherish 'dull,' " said Laura Palmer, a freelance producer for NBC who spent her 20's in the West Village and now lives with her daughter and two poodles in a rental building nearby. "There are two schools, and in the morning the streets are filled with children," Ms. Palmer said. "There's a lot of life, without there being a trendiness to go with it -- there is absolutely no scene here."</p>
        <p>The author Susan Cheever, who lives with her daughter and son in an apartment below Ms. Palmer's, walked by with her corgi, Lydia. "There is something of a literary scene," Ms. Cheever said. It includes Jean Stein, the editor and publisher of Grand Street Magazine; Jane Hitchcock, a novelist; the journalist Terry McDonnell and his novelist wife, J. M., and Jeanette Watson Sanger, owner of Books &amp; Co. at 939 Madison Avenue. Among other residents are Walter Cronkite, Willard Scott and Patricia Neal. ("And there's my darling hairdresser, Richard, who's on East End," said Ms. Neal. "I love it.")</p>
        <p>The City and Suburban Homes, a complex of six-story tenements from York Avenue to the river along 79th Street, was constructed in sections from 1901 to 1913. But luxury apartment house developers hesitated to go so far east until the pioneering Chapin School built its own Georgian-style building in 1928 at 100 East End, at 84th Street. (Today, tuition is $12,000 for kindergarten, $13,150 for grades 1-12).</p>
        <p>The Brearley School moved to its own factory-style building in 1929 at 610 East 83d Street, near East End. A 2-floor addition to the existing 10 stories has recently been completed. Tuition is $12,900 from kindergarten through 4th grade, $13,400 from 5th through 12th grades. Admission to both schools requires applications, interviews and entrance examinations.</p>
        <p>One block down from City and Suburban, at 1458 York Avenue, P.S. 158 provides a literacy-based enrichment program for grades K-6. The Parent Association, its $190,000 budget the result of year-round fund-raising, pays salaries for additional teachers, classroom materials and cultural enrichment programs.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, on the fifth floor, is the East Side Middle School, a District 2 school in its fourth year. Admission is based on test scores, interviews and submitted written work. The school has affiliations with science and art museums and with concert-band and cultural programs. Seventy-five percent of graduates proceed to the city's specialized high schools or to private schools on scholarship, according to the director, Lawrence Hirsch.</p>
        <p>Roman Catholic schools in the neighborhood include St. Joseph's School of Yorkville (K-8, $1,800 a year) at 420 East 87th Street, and St. Stephen of Hungary School, at 408 East 82d Street (K-8, $2,000 a year).</p>
        <p>In 1928, a Board of Estimate ruling restricted development on East End Avenue to residential use below 84th Street. The 14-story building at 25 East End was first up (a two-bedroom co-op with east and south river views has a current asking price near $600,000). It was followed by No. 120; built by Vincent Astor (who had earlier built 520 and 530 East 86th Street), it has 17 stories, large rooms, and views of the park and the river. Its 23-room penthouse sold last summer for $5.85 million. A 10-room, 3-bedroom unit is available for $1.85 million.</p>
        <p>BUILDINGS along Gracie Square, on the park's southern border, also date from the late 1920's/early 1930's, the most coveted being No. 10, a 15-story co-op facing the river. The penthouse is on the market for $5.9 million; a 15-room duplex, $6.75 million.</p>
        <p>Gracie Gardens, a quartet of low red-brick buildings with a central garden between 89th and 90th Streets, from East End to York Avenue, was one of the few developments of the Depression and war years. A two-bedroom, two-bath co-op is $275,000 (maintenance $1,700), said Lynn Keller of Elias Bernstein Real Estate.</p>
        <p>No. 180, built in 1960, was the first Manhattan building with an indoor pool on its roof. The two-bedroom penthouse in the 21-story building has an asking price of $1.1 million.</p>
        <p>The south side of 180 looks over the 240-bed Beth Israel Medical Center (North Division), the former Doctors' Hospital, and, in particular, its emergency room entrance and loading dock on 88th Street. Residents have complained about traffic, noise and impending construction of an additional floor housing an M.R.I. unit and angiography suite. A hospital spokesperson said that loading-dock hours had been restricted and that carting vendors had been changed to insure garbage collection after 7 A.M.</p>
        <p>There are groups of town houses on the side streets, primarily East 84th, 87th, and 89th. A four-story, two-family town house at 532 East 87th is on the market for $850,000.</p>
        <p>Residents find most services and dining spots on York and First Avenues, but there are three restaurants in the immediate neighborhood. Sirabella's, at No. 72 East End, can wedge 45 patrons into its intimate space, serving classic Italian fare, dinner only. Reservations are preferred.</p>
        <p>At the remodeled Le Boeuf a la Mode, at 539 East 81st Street, there is Piaf and French pop on the sound system, sidewalk seating in warm weather, and prix fixe and a la carte menus featuring duck, escargot, rack of lamb and steak au poivre.</p>
        <p>Dennis Spilios sat at a back table in his Le Panto, at 94 East End, at the corner of 84th Street. "I had a sort of coffee shop/diner, but it didn't work out," Mr. Spilios said. "So, on April 24, tablecloths, candles. A cafe/ bistro. With an updated American Continental menu."</p>
