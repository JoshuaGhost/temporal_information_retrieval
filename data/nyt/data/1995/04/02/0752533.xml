        <p>In the observation of a half-century tradition, New York fly-fisherfolk gathered Friday night near the Junction Pool of the Beaverkill for the annual Two-Headed Trout dinner. Begun in the 1940's by the former New York Timesman Red Smith, the original group of diners included fly-fishing pioneer Lee Wulff and A. J. McClane, who was perhaps the greatest American angling author of all time -- if you don't count Ernest Hemingway. Over the years the dinner party grew, taking over all of the tables in the Antrim Inn, a wonderful Catskills roadhouse that went out of business a few years ago.</p>
        <p>The party and the trout have since moved to the nearby Rockland House and yes, the trout does have two heads, but savvy anglers have long suspected a taxidermist's subterfuge.</p>

        <p>In the observation of a half-century tradition, New York fly-fisherfolk gathered Friday night near the Junction Pool of the Beaverkill for the annual Two-Headed Trout dinner. Begun in the 1940's by the former New York Timesman Red Smith, the original group of diners included fly-fishing pioneer Lee Wulff and A. J. McClane, who was perhaps the greatest American angling author of all time -- if you don't count Ernest Hemingway. Over the years the dinner party grew, taking over all of the tables in the Antrim Inn, a wonderful Catskills roadhouse that went out of business a few years ago.</p>
        <p>The party and the trout have since moved to the nearby Rockland House and yes, the trout does have two heads, but savvy anglers have long suspected a taxidermist's subterfuge.</p>
        <p>As we pulled into the village of Roscoe, I wondered why the air was so thick. "Wood smoke," I thought. Wrong. It was snow -- great, big, heartless flakes driven by a spiteful north wind. The warm dining room was full of 120 fishermen renewing friendships and sharing high hopes for the coming season. A double dose of good news -- the impending opening of the trout season and the apparent end of the hateful baseball strike -- performed the heretofore impossible feat of banishing O. J. talk for a few hours.</p>
        <p>The host, Paul Jorgensen, kept the speeches (stream updates, conservation news, etc.) mercifully brief as did the customarily discursive Art Lee, who brought sad news of friends who didn't last the year and good news of some other old friends who had pulled through. Coral-colored brook trout began the feast for the largely catch-and-release crowd (the brookies were farm raised). We moved on to big slabs of prime rib and finished the evening with strawberry shortcake and an hour of table hopping.</p>
        <p>It must have been the roast beef or maybe just the excitement of a new season, but at 3:30 A.M., I was sitting up in bed and staring out the window at a clear sky full of stars as bright as Christmas lights. In my state of half slumber, I heard the whistle and rumble of a phantom freight train. There are no trains to the Beaverkill anymore. There hasn't been one for years, but my sleepy mind was full of stories of Lee Wulff and Ray Bergman (the author of the classic "Trout") who used to take the train to the Beaverkill in the days before the highway.</p>
        <p>I dozed on and off (mostly off) until 5:30, at which point I left my motel room and walked down to the Junction Pool. There were a few fishermen ahead of me. The day was clear but cold. The banks filled up with anglers, 30 of them by 6:05. The trout were surrounded by anglers who threw feathers, metal and bait at the Beaverkill browns. We left the pool before the first fish was caught.</p>
        <p>Keith Lynch and Tanya DeStefano, aspiring chefs from Sullivan County Community College, had set up a tent and were frying some onions, carrots and trout fillets dredged in walnut paste (these trout too were hatchery raised). They smelled great.</p>
        <p>We drove up the Willowemoc (a main Beverkill tributary). The Catskill Fly-Fishing Center, a very picturesque group of buildings, was shut but we stopped and peered inside the new exhibition hall (set to open on Memorial Day). In the center of the atrium was a statue memorializing Lee Wulff, net extended, and rod bent by a trout. We drove the whole valley of first the Willowemoc and then downstream along the Beaverkill to Hancock and the main stem of the Delaware.</p>
        <p>We met up with a friend, Jim Levison, a retired New York City detective who fishes all the time. We debated where to fish. I proposed backtracking to a sheltered pool near the hamlet of East Branch.</p>
        <p>When we arrived, there were, as I suspected, clouds of caddis blowing off in the sun-warmed waters. There were more clouds landing and skittering. If the trout were food-minded they would have been on the surface. But they weren't. We fished with lead, watching our lines sinking through the green waters to where the trout surely lay.</p>
        <p>No fish. But then, opening day is always that way. Just knowing that for the first time in a year, one could probably yell "Play ball!" to men and trout is enough for me. This year both opportunities arrived in the nick of time.  OUTDOORS</p>
