        <p>Travelers arriving at one of La Guardia Airport's terminals will not have to squeeze through the usual gantlet of sign-waving limousine drivers or risk a ride with a fare-gouging gypsy-cab driver under an experimental plan that takes effect tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The hope is that the 60-day experiment will reduce the illegal solicitations that have long plagued the city's airport, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday. Other than yellow cabdrivers, who must wait in designated lines, state law forbids drivers at the airports to pick up passengers who have not made previous arrangements.</p>

        <p>Travelers arriving at one of La Guardia Airport's terminals will not have to squeeze through the usual gantlet of sign-waving limousine drivers or risk a ride with a fare-gouging gypsy-cab driver under an experimental plan that takes effect tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The hope is that the 60-day experiment will reduce the illegal solicitations that have long plagued the city's airport, officials of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said yesterday. Other than yellow cabdrivers, who must wait in designated lines, state law forbids drivers at the airports to pick up passengers who have not made previous arrangements.</p>
        <p>"We're going to create what we're calling a limousine driver Meet and Greet Area in the Delta terminal in order to make it easier for passengers to find their drivers," said Kevin Dillon, manager of airport services at La Guardia.</p>
        <p>"Any driver outside this area is not legitimate and is, theoretically, hustling in the terminal -- meaning that they are soliciting business because they don't have a prearranged pickup," Mr. Dillon said.</p>
        <p>If the test is successful, the program will be extended to other terminals at La Guardia, he said.</p>
        <p>Some limousine and gypsy-cab drivers, whose vehicles are not metered, charge exorbitant rates, he said. A ride into Manhattan, for instance, whether in a medallion taxi or a stretch limousine, should cost between $25 and $50.</p>
        <p>"But if you get somebody who is not familiar with the New York area, the hustlers can turn around and ask for $150," Mr. Dillon said.</p>
