        <p>REMEMBERING MY GOOD FRIENDS An Autobiography. By George Weidenfeld. Illustrated. 483 pp. New York:  HarperCollins Publishers. $30.</p>
        <p>FOR a preview of "Remembering My Good Friends," try the index. (You're probably in it.) These thousand names are not just players in George Weidenfeld's story of his life and careers; in an essential way they are the man himself. To call Lord Weidenfeld a name-dropper would be like calling Johnny Appleseed a gentleman farmer. Yes, there are plenty of droppings here, but there is also a lot of gathering, with careful cultivation throughout.</p>
        <p>It's been a bustling life; just meeting everybody from Nabokov to Bellow, Bernard Berenson to Isaiah Berlin, Picasso to Sam Spiegel, Lyndon Johnson to George Bush, Weizmann to Ben-Gurion to Rabin would keep a fellow on the run. But the social success always had its serious side. In his drive to chat or drink or dine with the Who's Who of several continents, Mr. Weidenfeld became a renowned publisher, an effective advocate for his lifelong cause of Zionism and a considerable figure in the upper echelons of English Jewry.</p>
        <p>The story begins in a fondly recalled Vienna in the years leading up to the Anschluss. George was the somewhat cosseted only child in a cultivated, comfortably situated, politically liberal Jewish family, exemplars of a Central European culture that was about to be extinguished. The author signals his own future when he pictures himself as a lonely youth with a craving for friends: "Solitude was the norm, conviviality the form of entertainment I most longed for." That longing plainly persisted for another half-century, even after his dance card was brimming.</p>
        <p>One of the first famous names to appear is Kurt Waldheim, a fellow student whom Mr. Weidenfeld remembers as helping him out when existence for Jewish students became difficult. "Waldheim was no hero," he writes. "He was not the stuff Resistance fighters are made of. But then he shared the challenges and lifesaving responses of the vast mass of middle-class Austrians." That sort of tempered evaluation is for acquaintances; good friends naturally get warmer treatment.</p>
        <p>In 1938 young George made it to England, leaving his parents behind temporarily. He must have been an engaging lad as well as a bright one, for he managed to win plenty of assistance in his efforts to start first a magazine and then a publishing house.</p>
        <p>He called his short-lived magazine Contact, which perfectly suited his method of operation. Here is how it worked: Through an acquaintance at London University, he met Stephen Spender, who put him onto Philip Toynbee. "It was through Philip that I became involved with the Nicolsons, for Benedict Nicolson, elder son of Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West, was his closest friend. Ben . . . worked as assistant keeper of the King's pictures under Anthony Blunt and became art critic of Contact. It was not until later that he brought me together with his younger brother Nigel, who was to become my partner." And so was born the estimable firm of Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.</p>
        <p>Or how about this: When Clarissa Churchill leaves his firm to marry Anthony Eden, he replaces her with Antonia Pakenham, who marries Hugh Fraser, a Tory M.P., and as Antonia Fraser goes on to write best-selling biographies and then takes for her next husband Harold Pinter.</p>
        <p>As a publisher, Mr. Weidenfeld proved a master at capturing the memoirs of the mighty. If he did not know Tito or Adenauer he was sure to know somebody who knew somebody who could get him an introduction. Literary works were not his specialty, but he became clubby with London's literary lions, too, even though one might growl to another, "Our friend George is a bit of a Hebrew."</p>
        <p>THAT he never denied. When he was made a peer, courtesy of his good friend Harold Wilson, and needed a coat of arms, he stuck in the ramparts of Jerusalem and a sage with a long beard. His account of the tricky political situation of British Jewry in the years leading up to the creation of the state of Israel and his descriptions of generations of Israeli leaders, all of whom he seems to have known well, are discerning.</p>
        <p>Money for starting up his publishing firm came from his good friend Israel Sieff, a partner with Simon Marks in Marks &amp; Spencer, the big British department-store chain, whose socks I can recommend. And before you could say l'chaim he married into the British version of Our Crowd.</p>
        <p>That union did not last. Nor did his second marriage, to a sometime wife of Cyril Connolly. Nor his third, to a member of the American Whitney-Payson clan. (He is now on his fourth.) He mentions "casual infidelities on my part" and his reputation as a ladies' man, although it's hard to imagine where he got the time. But this is no tell-all tale. When it comes to personal matters, he holds back in a gentlemanly way; he loosens up in company.</p>
        <p>Not every chapter of "Remembering My Good Friends" is fascinating, and the names can grow thick, but Mr. Weidenfeld makes a pleasant companion. And if it's portraits you're after -- of four decades of major players in British, European and American publishing and politics, of world-class high fliers and of Israel's founders and defenders -- his engaging book gives a big assortment and good value. Like Marks &amp; Spencer.  Walter Goodman is a television critic for The New York Times.</p>
