        <p>As crime becomes more and more a part of life on campus, so does a sight once unfamiliar in what people like to think of as a refuge from the real world: college police officers on patrol, guns at their hips.</p>
        <p>Already, officers at about a dozen state and county campuses carry guns. And at two others, a policy against arming the campus police is causing tension between college officials, who say the presence of guns violates the academic spirit, and police officers, who say the administrators and trustees are naively clinging to the idea of a campus as a sacrosanct place.</p>
        <p>At William Paterson College here, the 23 police officers, who patrol the 250-acre campus and are members of the Policemen's Benevolent Association, have long pressed for guns. They got a minor concession after an incident last fall during which they had to wait 14 minutes for help from Wayne police officers to respond to a report of an armed intruder in a dormitory. Now, during an emergency, the college police officers can arm themselves by getting the shift supervisor's permission. The guns are kept in the campus police building.</p>
        <p>The officers, however, say they will not feel secure unless they are armed while on duty. "Twenty years ago, I would have agreed that we didn't need guns on campuses," said Patrolman David Tartza, a member of the force at the college and a P.B.A.  representative who has strongly pushed for guns. "But society's changed, and campuses have changed. We're only 1.6 miles away from the heart of Paterson."</p>
        <p>Arnold Speert, the president of the college, says that in a country obsessed with crime, most colleges are likely to hire armed police officers. But he says William Paterson does not have enough crime to need armed officers. Figures for 1994 show crime dropping in most cases -- with larceny and theft making up the bulk of incidents, though two rapes and one aggravated assault were recorded.</p>
        <p>Arming police officers "has an effect of suggesting that this is an environment that is as plagued and fragile as are other communities," Mr. Speert said. He went on; "For the most part, that's not true. We do have a special environment. We have classrooms; we have a museum. I think that environment is important to maintain. But as our institutions become more diverse, some people also wonder whether the call for more arms is a response to more diversity."</p>
        <p>Indeed, the student government and the student newspaper have supported arming the officers. But some students say they would feel uneasy surrounded by armed police officers.</p>
        <p>Police officers at Montclair State University have also been lobbying for arms. Currently, Kean College, Trenton State College, Richard Stockton College, the New Jersey Institute of Technology, the University of Medicine and Dentistry, Rutgers University and two community colleges -- Middlesex and Essex -- have armed police officers, who are trained at state police academies just as municipal police officers are. Other public colleges have security officers who are not trained to carry firearms.</p>
        <p>The private campuses rely on security guards or police officers, but none are armed, according to Chuck Novell, a public safety official at Princeton who is president of the 40-member New Jersey College and University Public Safety Association.</p>
        <p>Still, in New Jersey as in the rest of the nation, colleges are moving from employing security officers to unarmed police officers to finally armed officers, said Dorothy Siegel, the director of the National Campus Violence Prevention Center. The organization, based at Towson State University in Maryland, tracks campus crime.</p>
        <p>As campus police forces shift from the traditional role of crime prevention to law enforcement, more of them will demand guns, she said. "If you're going to say someone's a police officer and you're not going to arm him, you really are defrocking the police officer," she said.</p>
        <p>Tom Evans, who worked for the New Jersey State Police before becoming chief of the private Drew University's unarmed security force, says he understands the need for guns at other insitutions. But he cautions that as more police forces are armed, they will have to rethink their roles carefully.</p>
        <p>"Do we jump straight into full-time policing, doing things like search and seizure?" he said. "Do we want SWAT teams and dogs? When you're dealing with students, it takes a special kind of training."  ON CAMPUS</p>
