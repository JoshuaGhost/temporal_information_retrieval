        <p>Last week, in the days after Rwandan troops opened fire on a panicked crowd of Hutu refugees, the death count remained in dispute but one thing was clear: Rwanda's Government was further than ever from achieving reconciliation between the country's two major ethnic groups, the Hutu and the Tutsi.</p>
        <p>The Government was claiming that 300 people were killed after Rwanda's army began forcibly closing down camps where as many as 300,000 Hutu had taken refuge. The United Nations said the toll was 2,000 dead.</p>

        <p>Last week, in the days after Rwandan troops opened fire on a panicked crowd of Hutu refugees, the death count remained in dispute but one thing was clear: Rwanda's Government was further than ever from achieving reconciliation between the country's two major ethnic groups, the Hutu and the Tutsi.</p>
        <p>The Government was claiming that 300 people were killed after Rwanda's army began forcibly closing down camps where as many as 300,000 Hutu had taken refuge. The United Nations said the toll was 2,000 dead.</p>
        <p>The camps had been created by the French military last July when Hutu were fleeing Tutsi rebels. But the Government and United Nations officials said the camps were sanctuaries for armed Hutu militias, and the United Nations tried to close them.</p>
        <p>On April 18, the Government began doing so itself, but about 50,000 Hutu refused to leave and were herded onto a hilltop in Kibeho, where the army began screening them in search of Hutu militia members -- who in turn attacked fellow Hutu who wanted to leave. Twice, the army opened fire when Hutu tried to break through the military cordon.Militias also fired at the army. A week later, about 1,000 Hutu still remained holed up in a compound in Kibeho, refusing to leave. DONATELLA LORCH</p>
