        <p>Electrical rates are going up again, by about 45 cents a month for typical residential consumers, after a vote by the Board of Public Utilities on a request from the Public Service Electric and Gas Company. In November, the board granted the utility an increase that raised the monthly bill of the average residential consumer about $2.40. The latest increase, amounting to $130 million, is intended to offset fuel costs that were higher than anticipated. Rates for nonresidential consumers will rise by 5.8 percent. A consumer group, New Jersey Citizen Action, said it would appeal the board's decision in state court.</p>
