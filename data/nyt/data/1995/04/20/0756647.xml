        <p>Jazz 115, Rockets 96</p>
        <p>Karl Malone scored a season-high 45 points, including 13 in the pivotal third period last night, as the Utah Jazz rolled to a 115-96 victory over the Houston Rockets, their probable first-round playoff opponent.</p>
        <p>Malone hit 16 of 24 shots and had 17 rebounds as the Jazz evened its season series with the Rockets at 2-2 and extended their winning streak to five games.</p>
        <p>John Stockton had 19 points and 15 assists, while David Benoit had 19 and 13 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Hakeem Olajuwon had 30 points and 10 rebounds for the Rockets, who will try to avenge the loss Sunday when Utah travels to Houston for both teams' regular season finale. Utah pulled within one and a half games of the idle San Antonio Spurs for first place in the Western Conference. Bullets 123, Magic 117</p>
        <p>Chris Webber posted his third triple-double of the season last night as Washington took advantage of Shaquille O'Neal's absence to beat Orlando in overtime. The loss was Magic's sixth in a row on the road. Webber had 17 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists as the Bullets won for the second time in three games after dropping 13 in row.</p>
        <p>Juwan Howard, who added 27 points, gave the Bullets the lead for good at 116-115 on a free throw with 1 minute 39 seconds left in overtime. Mitchell Butler then buried a 3-pointer from the right corner for a 4-point cushion with 1:11 to go.</p>
        <p>O'Neal, bothered by tendinitis in his left knee, missed his third game of the season. Orlando, which clinched the Atlantic Division title and the top record in the Eastern Conference by beating the Bullets on Monday, is 2-1 without him. Pacers 103, 76ers 91</p>
        <p>Indiana moved within one victory of its first National Basketball Association divisional title by defeating visiting Philadelphia as Rik Smits had 25 points and 12 rebounds. Derrick McKey added 20 points and 11 rebounds, giving the Pacers a sweep of the season-series with Philadelphia for the first time ever.</p>
        <p>The Pacers scored 11 straight points to pull away as the 76ers went more than 4 minutes without scoring in the fourth period. Indiana, which can clinch the Central Division title with one more victory or one more loss by Charlotte, led, 83-81, with 8:08 left after a basket by Philadelphia's Scott Williams.</p>
        <p>The victory also kept alive Indiana's slim hopes of catching the Knicks for home-court advantage through the second round of the playoffs. Bucks 106, Celtics 97</p>
        <p>In Milwaukee, Vin Baker scored 27 points and Glenn Robinson got 26 as the Bucks stayed alive in the playoff race with a victory over Boston.</p>
        <p>Eric Murdock added 20 points, 10 assists and 8 rebounds for the Bucks, who trail Boston by two games for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with two games left for both teams.</p>
        <p>The Bucks, who haven't reached the playoffs since the 1990-91 season, travel to Cleveland for a game tonight and close out the regular season Sunday at home against Chicago. Cavaliers 90, Heat 79</p>
        <p>Tyrone Hill had 21 points and 16 rebounds and Bobby Phills registered his first career triple-double to lead the Cavaliers against visiting Miami. Phills scored 11 points, tied a career-high with 11 rebounds and had a career-high 10 assists. It was only the 11th triple-double in the Cavaliers' 26 seasons in the National Basketball Association. Phills also had a career-high five steals.</p>
        <p>Cleveland had lost three straight games to Miami, including an 85-84 setback in Miami last Thursday.</p>
