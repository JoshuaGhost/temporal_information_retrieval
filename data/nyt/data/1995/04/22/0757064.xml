        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil is making the case for admission to the United Nations Security Council. Judging from your report on his United States visit (April 15), he has a list of selling points: large population, privatization program, increased trade, high economic growth and participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations.</p>
        <p>But behind that rosy picture, over half of all Brazilians remain mired in poverty. On an average day, 1,000 children die from malnutrition and sickness. Yet, as Mr. Cardoso acknowledges, the economy is booming. Why, then, haven't the poor majority seen the benefits of growth?</p>
        <p>The answer lies in the overwhelming concentration of resources in the hands of an elite minority. Brazil's power brokers do not see it in their interest to develop an economy that meets the needs of the majority.</p>
        <p>To get elected, Mr. Cardoso allied himself with reactionary big landowners. The alliance of government and landed oligarchy is responsible for the forced exodus of more than 20 million peasants from their land since 1965.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardoso believes increased foreign investment will bring development. But, as in Mexico, only a small percentage of the population benefits from the kind of investment he seeks. If the Mexican crisis teaches anything it is that economic growth and economic development are not the same thing.</p>
        <p>The United Nations would be wise to hold off on Brazil's request for a permanent Security Council seat until Mr. Cardoso shows a commitment to policies to eliminate the extremes of grinding poverty and obscene luxury.
