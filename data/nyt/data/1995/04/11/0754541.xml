        <p>"AIN'T no loyalty in sports no more." It is not an uncommon observation in these times, an opinion heard and accepted widely, and decorous usage be damned. Much of the contemporary viewpoint derives from the aspect of free agency in baseball, which began with the elimination of the reserve clause nearly 20 years ago, when the players got the muscle as well as the illuminating notion that, well, loyalty must be a two-way street. In other words, pay me what I'm worth, boss, or I'm outta here.</p>
        <p>The street has currently become a boulevard, clogged like an open-air marketplace by people with bats and gloves and baseball shoes selling not their equipment, but their abilities, and others in suits and vests selling the players, as in days of old, whether they like it or not.</p>

        <p>"AIN'T no loyalty in sports no more." It is not an uncommon observation in these times, an opinion heard and accepted widely, and decorous usage be damned. Much of the contemporary viewpoint derives from the aspect of free agency in baseball, which began with the elimination of the reserve clause nearly 20 years ago, when the players got the muscle as well as the illuminating notion that, well, loyalty must be a two-way street. In other words, pay me what I'm worth, boss, or I'm outta here.</p>
        <p>The street has currently become a boulevard, clogged like an open-air marketplace by people with bats and gloves and baseball shoes selling not their equipment, but their abilities, and others in suits and vests selling the players, as in days of old, whether they like it or not.</p>
        <p>Free-agent ballplayers are working and sweating on the field in Homestead, Fla., and baseball executives with players under contract are working and sweating on the phones in their offices.</p>
        <p>Die-hard fans, however, often can't be bothered with what someone is or is not worth, unless that someone is, perhaps, that fan himself, who is slaving away in a factory or a shop or even a board room.</p>
        <p>The fan demands his entertainment. And if he's paying for it, he deserves it. After all, professional baseball grew hugely popular simply as spectator entertainment.</p>
        <p>And historically, when the paying customer was no longer entertained by the knickered major leaguers, the teams departed -- from Toledo, from Rochester, from Boston, from Philadelphia, from lots of places. Like the corner candy store that suffers from the competition across the street, or a Broadway show that finds its ticket sales dwindling, the owners must find other ways to make a buck. You can't eat loyalty.</p>
        <p>The fan of an existing team today, however, is upset when one of his favorite players departs the local premises for greener outfield pastures, condemning him for perceived greed. But it is not top secret that players once left for another team only if they were sold or traded. Like Babe Ruth, twice, or Jackie Robinson, or a majority in the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>If there wasn't owner loyalty to such immortals, how could one expect loyalty to, say, Dick Littlefield, a left-handed pitcher who in a nine-year major league career in the 1950's was traded or sold by nine teams -- the Red Sox, White Sox, Browns, Tigers, Orioles, Pirates, Cardinals, Giants and Cubs. Or George Brunet, a pitcher who from 1953 to 1971 was shuttled from major and minor league teams 29 times. "Sometimes," he said, "I'd walk out of the ball park and forgot where I lived."</p>
        <p>Still fresh in the mind is the time Tom Seaver, The Franchise, asked for a contract extension. M. Donald Grant called him an "ingrate" and spitefully traded him to the Reds.</p>
        <p>Loyalty is a debatable quality, an elusive quality, but certainly not an impossible one. Owners have indeed kept a player they've liked beyond the player's true use, and provided him with a job following his playing career. And a player like Ted Williams actually refused a raise because he was dissatisfied with his previous season.</p>
        <p>But in fact, one of the cornerstones of the business of baseball is lack of loyalty. The first baseball superstar, Mike (King) Kelly, was sold in 1887 by the Chicago White Stockings to the Boston Nationals for what fans in Chicago bitterly called "ten thousand dollars in Puritanic gold."</p>
        <p>And earlier than that, before the reserve clause, players moved from town to town and played for the highest bidder. "Have Arm, Will Travel" is in the grand tradition of the national pastime.</p>
        <p>When Reggie Jackson moved from the A's to the Orioles to the Yankees to the Angels, the only question fans in each city asked was, can he bring us a pennant?</p>
        <p>The same will be true of Larry Walker, Billy Swift and John Burkett.</p>
        <p>Over the past eight baseball work stoppages, fans grumbled, but every time returned to their entertainment in what we are told were record numbers. How and why the new players showed up will again matter little so long as they bring us excitement, if not a title.</p>
        <p>In fact all of us, players, owners and fans, have historically been in the same league. Loyalty is fine, so long as it does not intrude on our pleasure, or profits.</p>
