        <p>'Water'  PBS (In New York, Channel 13, tonight at 10)</p>
        <p>Big decisions on what to do about water are explored in four reports, from California, Australia, Mexico City and New Zealand, each stiffly introduced by James Earl Jones as if he were rationing his words. Although the hour does not exactly flow, it is a fount of information about the fight in Southern California over diverting to Los Angeles water once used for agriculture, the waste of fresh water in Australia's Great Artesian Basin, the dire shortages in crowded Mexico City and the consequences for New Zealand of its reliance on hydroelectric dams.
