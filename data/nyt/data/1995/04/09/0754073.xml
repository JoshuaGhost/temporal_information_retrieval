        <p>SHERRI SPILLANE, casting agent for pimps, athletes connected to violent crimes and "actors" who are associated with athletes connected to violent crimes, says that her job is really good old-fashioned charity work.</p>
        <p>"I help people," she said about the scandalous (or as she prefers to call them, "high-profile, controversial") client list she recently developed at the Ruth Webb talent agency here.

        <p>SHERRI SPILLANE, casting agent for pimps, athletes connected to violent crimes and "actors" who are associated with athletes connected to violent crimes, says that her job is really good old-fashioned charity work.</p>
        <p>"I help people," she said about the scandalous (or as she prefers to call them, "high-profile, controversial") client list she recently developed at the Ruth Webb talent agency here. The first was the figure skater Tonya Harding, who was stripped of her national championship for her role in the attack on her rival, Nancy Kerrigan, last year.</p>
        <p>"I felt the press was maligning her as if she were a Manson killer," said Ms. Spillane (don't even bother to ask her age), a former Las Vegas showgirl who has been an agent for Ms. Webb since the mid-1980's.</p>
        <p>"I felt sorry for her," she added. "I wanted to help her."</p>
        <p>Since signing Ms. Harding eight months ago, Ms. Spillane has also picked up Sydney Biddle Barrows (who ran a high-end prostitution ring several years ago and wrote "The Mayflower Madam"); Jennifer Young, the roommate to another madam, Heidi Fleiss, whose clothing line she markets; Tammy Faye Bakker; Randal Tamayei, a Judge Lance Ito look-alike, and her personal favorite, Joey Buttafuoco, the auto mechanic whose romantic trysts with a Long Island teen-ager, Amy Fisher, resulted in a bullet wound to the head for his wife, Mary Jo, and, thanks to the agency, a few tickets to the Academy Awards ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Combing publications like The National Enquirer each week, Ms. Spillane looks for people whose names have in some way been dragged through the mud, and contemplates how to turn shame into bit parts.</p>
        <p>"I don't think what we're doing here is so outrageous," Ms. Spillane said in an interview in her office, which is also Ms. Webb's home in the hills of Hollywood. "These people have been thrown into the spotlight, and some of them cannot wait to get out of it. And others, once they have experienced it, never want it to go away. It is fun and a challenge to show the world you can get these people work." Ms. Webb, who is in her 70's, has handled the dinner theater crowd for decades and still has clients like Don Knotts, Dawn Wells (Mary Ann, of "Gilligan's Island" fame) and Lynda Carter.</p>
        <p>The two say their greatest coup was Mr. Buttafuoco. "He is talented, generous and totally cleared of all charges," said Ms. Spillane, who took Mr. and Mrs. Buttafuoco, along with her partner, Ruth Webb, to the Oscar ceremonies this year. Since signing him several months ago, she has landed him a part in a film called "Cul-de-Sac," and she said more auditions are on the way.</p>
        <p>The fondness seems to run both ways. "I like Sherri," Mr. Buttafuoco said in a telephone interview. "She's a right-there kind of woman, very classy. There's a lot of sharks out there, as you know."</p>
        <p>O DDLY enough, Mr. Buttafuoco does not think Ms. Spillane sought him out because of the hours he clocked on prime time defending himself against Amy Fisher. It was, he said, the acting talent he felt he had demonstrated previously in some little-seen rock videos.</p>
        <p>"There is no connection between the scandal and my fame," he said. "My legal problems are over and done with. I'm doing a work-out video now, I have a book deal, and I love movies. I think I can work both coasts."</p>
        <p>Miss Barrows, who is hoping for a job as a talk show host, also admires her agent. "I like the fact that she is persistent, honest and always returns my phone calls," she said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Webb chats plenty on the phone, she spends most of her day up in her bedroom, with her 1,500 stuffed raccoons, typing out her memoirs. Ms. Spillane and another agent, Scott Stander, appear to be the real worker bees. Each morning, they plow through a list of available roles, looking for spots for their clients.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spillane's ex-husband, the author Mickey Spillane, left her a decade ago in a flurry of lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Not all professional relationships have turned out well, either. Brian (Kato) Kaelin, the house guest of O. J. Simpson, didn't work out; he refused to audition for roles. John Wayne Bobbitt, the man whose wife severed his penis, was dumped after he made an X-rated film. The flagship star, Ms. Harding, has been dropped, because she refused too many projects, Ms. Spillane said.</p>
        <p>"She turned down the new Woody Allen movie," she said. "She said she didn't like his morals. No joke."</p>
        <p>Time is of the essence when it comes to harvesting talent from misfortune. "You can't wait too long once a scandal breaks," Ms. Spillane said.</p>
        <p>Proof: Remember the cat trapped for hours last year in an airplane, finally rescued after hours of its owner's pleas for help? Well, Ms. Spillane thought it over a bit too long, and when she finally had committed her heart to signing the cat, another agent had already snapped it up. "Well, what would you have done with it anyway?" Ms. Webb sniffed. Ms. Spillane became a bit indignant. "I would have had an animated series and a book out by now, that's what."</p>
        <p>She has fantasy clients. "I tried to get that kid who was caned in Asia, but he never called back," she said. "Also, I want Desiree Washington, the woman who was raped by Mike Tyson, because I think her life is ruined and she's from my hometown and I want to help her."</p>
        <p>For now, though, she has her hands full with current clients. Ms. Spillane mentions another promising performer, Ms. Bakker. "We have 'Hello Dolly' in mind for her," she said.</p>
