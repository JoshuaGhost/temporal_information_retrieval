        <p>WITH the flurry of new Tuscan and other northern Italian restaurants that have opened over the last two to three years, it is rather endearing to come upon the sort of Italian fare and surroundings we remember from childhood.</p>
        <p>Ristorante Faustini in East Haven, though it advertises "delicate northern Italian cuisine," serves with the most assurance dishes with strong echoes of the past.

        <p>WITH the flurry of new Tuscan and other northern Italian restaurants that have opened over the last two to three years, it is rather endearing to come upon the sort of Italian fare and surroundings we remember from childhood.</p>
        <p>Ristorante Faustini in East Haven, though it advertises "delicate northern Italian cuisine," serves with the most assurance dishes with strong echoes of the past. Even the prices seem to be of an earlier era; note the early bird menu available before 6:30 P.M. on week nights, with 23 entrees available for $9.95, soup and salad included.</p>
        <p>The restaurant itself is quietly attractive, with knotty pine paneling, rows of banquettes along two walls and booths along a third, plants hanging from the ceiling, pink tablecloths, low lights.</p>
        <p>The large menu features squid dishes, both as starters and entrees, and they were among the best offerings. Especially lively was calamari Napolitano -- squid that was first fried, then gently sauteed with capers, pine nuts, olive oil, tomato and a heaping dose of garlic. Though an appetizer, it could have served two or doubled as an entree. The same was true of a heaping portion of crisp and crunchy calamari fritto.</p>
        <p>Both calamari fra diavolo and calamari Barcelona are entrees, both served over linguine in generous portions. The first came with a mildly spiced red sauce, but the Barcelona dish was more compelling -- the tender squid was sauteed with black and green olives, anchovies, capers, white wine and olive oil, a compatible combination.</p>
        <p>One of our better non-squid appetizers was stuffed fryer peppers, two long sweet Italian peppers stuffed with capers, black olives and bread crumbs, and baked just long enough for the peppers to cook, but not become mushy. Funghi Tuscano consisted of fresh mushrooms filled with a pleasing combo of sweet Italian sausage, escarole, garlic and provolone.</p>
        <p>One disappointment was pizzatelli a la Greque -- a thin-crust pizza described as including "fresh-picked Maine lobster meat." We found a few bits of what seemed to be shrimp; the lobster had escaped. The crust almost got away too, with scorched edges and bottom. Faring better was a generous portion of gamberi fagiole -- a melange of Gulf shrimp sauteed in olive oil with lots of cannellini, white wine and spinach.</p>
        <p>On the list of entree specials was osso buco, another huge and hearty dish. The veal shank was buried beneath a tomato sauce rife with celery chunks, onions and carrots and served over al dente fettuccine.</p>
        <p>Pork Marchigiano -- medallions of pork loin -- sounded terrific, sauteed with fire-roasted red peppers, sliced potatoes, green peas, mushrooms, garlic, rosemary and white wine. Alas, it was a dud, the pork boasting little flavor. Another disappointment was pollo Milano, chicken breast with prosciutto, tomato, and mozzarella, in a marsala wine-brown sauce -- bland despite the promise.</p>
        <p>Far better was melanzane alla rollatini -- eggplant stuffed with prosciutto and ricotta, topped with tomato sauce and baked. Tortellini alla papito, on the other hand, came with the tricolored cheese pasta stranded in a glutinous, unappetizing cream sauce smothered in garlic.</p>
        <p>Desserts included a rich, creamy chocolate mousse cake, rocky road cheesecake and amaretto cake. Skip the so-called creme brulee, which lacked the brulee part, bore a maraschino cherry on top and had a refrigerator taste.</p>
        <p>A three-course dinner for two came to $39, before tax, tip and drinks, emphasizing the nostalgic tone here. There is a moderate-size, mostly Italian wine list, reasonably priced.</p>
