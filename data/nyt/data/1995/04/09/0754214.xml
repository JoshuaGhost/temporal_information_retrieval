        <p>BAROLO ** (212) 226-1102; 398 West Broadway, near Spring; $$$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>The expansive dining rooms are done in warm yellow tones with comfortable dark green banquettes lining one wall. A handsome marble-topped bar in the main dining area displays a colorful antipasto selection, a billboard for the northern Italian cuisine. Choices include tartare of tuna with an avocado puree; polenta with Gorgonzola and prosciutto; salad of grilled calamari with couscous and avocado, and grilled quail with portobello mushrooms. Among pastas and main courses are garganelli in a ragout of lamb and artichokes; penne tossed in a spicy tomato sauce with shallots; seared filet mignon topped with a Barolo wine sauce; grilled tuna with a sauce of roasted eggplant, and stuffed chicken breast with goat cheese and pesto. (Review: 1/14/94)  CASCABEL ** (212) 431-7300; 218 Lafayette Street, near Spring; $$$; all major credit cards</p>
        <p>Defined by its deep red walls, tiny lights and modern art, this stylish contemporary restaurant is much more than just a trendy-looking downtown spot paired with the assertive and imaginative cooking of chef Tom Valenti. Starters to look for include marinated octopus and roasted tomato coulis with a garnish of periwinkles; smoked sturgeon over chicory and lardons and topped with a poached egg; foie gras-filled agnolotti in an aromatic leek and truffle broth, and grilled portobello with roasted sweet garlic and goat cheese turnover seasoned with a beet vinaigrette. The seductive main course selection features braised beef rib and its grilled tenderloin with smoked onions, leeks and spaetzle; roast guinea hen served with butternut squash and soft polenta; grilled pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon and accompanied by white bean ravioli, and braised tripe in Barolo wine with onions, carrots and tomatoes. (Review: 5/13/94)  CUB ROOM * (212) 677-4100; 131 Sullivan Street, at Prince; $$$; American Express</p>
        <p>This beautifully designed newcomer with exposed bare bricks walls, floor-to-ceiling windows, attractive lighting, comfortable seating and well-muffled sound has the warm, cozy feeling of a living room. The gracious staff always seems eager to please, and if you know what dishes to order, there are rewards to be had. For instance, the roast quail is a delightful appetizer, set over warm French lentils, frisee and potatoes; the marinated salmon, a tad sweet, is another winner served on toasted brioche with honey-mustard dressing, and crisp curried onion rings are not to be missed. Recommended main courses include the fillet of striped bass in red wine sauce topped with a golden mound pommes Anna; Cub steak (a fine piece of filet mignon) in a Cognac sauce with raisins and peppercorns and paired with scalloped potatoes, and roast chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach. (Review: 9/23/94)  INDOCHINE ** (212) 505-5111; 430 Lafayette Street, near Astor Place; $$: all major credit cards</p>
        <p>This colorful Southeast Asian spot remains one of best bets for authentic and light Vietnamese and Cambodian cooking in the city. The long rectangular room has a soothing tropical motif, with palm fronds painted on the walls and scattered greenery. Starters include a vivid squid salad with fresh mint and tamarind; sweet-and-sour shrimp soup, generous with perfectly cooked shrimp and flavored with pineapple and tamarind, or the bright vegetable spring rolls with crab meat. Among entrees are steamed fillet of sole in banana leaves with lemon grass and coconut milk; grilled prawns with crushed ginger and scallions over angel hair pasta; filet of beef served sliced in a sate sauce with vegetables, and skewered chicken brushed with a tamarind glaze with arugula and rice. (Review: 1/13/92; revisited: 3/30/95)  OMEN ** (212) 925-8923; 113 Thompson Street, near Prince; $; American Express</p>
        <p>This local Japanese favorite turns out high-quality healthful seafood-based cuisine at reasonable prices. The inviting setting has a timbered ceiling from which paper lanterns hang, striking calligraphy adorning the walls and neighborly tables. Omen is a seaweed-broth-based dish that combines radish, lotus root, broccoli, spinach and scallions with wheat noodles. An uncompromisingly fresh sashimi dinner might combine pristine octopus with a soy dipping sauce, tuna, red snapper and briny sea urchin. And there are are sauteed salmon and endive in sake; steamed acorn squash stuffed with vegetables and tofu; yellowtail and string beans teriyaki in sake; shrimp tempura, and sauteed duck and steamed bitter greens in a miso-mustard sauce.
