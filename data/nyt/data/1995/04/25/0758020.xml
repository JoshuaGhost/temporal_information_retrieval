        <p>A suitable title for Anatoly Karpov's next book would be, "How to Succeed at Chess Without Really Trying." The world champion recognized by the International Chess Federation wins on the basis of advantages so slight that they seem not to exist. His chief rival, Gary Kasparov, recognized as world champion by the Professional Chess Association, has called him a minimalist for using the least amount of effort to win his games.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Kasparov believes that Karpov's play is anti-creative, that Karpov does not reach out for the grand stroke of imagination that reveals the true adventure of the game. That may be so, but nevertheless Karpov has the imagination to turn a scarcely seen ripple into a victory unforeseen by others. His game against Aleksandr Khalifman in Round 7 of the Linares International Tournament, which took place in the Spanish city last month, shows his winning methods.</p>

        <p>A suitable title for Anatoly Karpov's next book would be, "How to Succeed at Chess Without Really Trying." The world champion recognized by the International Chess Federation wins on the basis of advantages so slight that they seem not to exist. His chief rival, Gary Kasparov, recognized as world champion by the Professional Chess Association, has called him a minimalist for using the least amount of effort to win his games.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Kasparov believes that Karpov's play is anti-creative, that Karpov does not reach out for the grand stroke of imagination that reveals the true adventure of the game. That may be so, but nevertheless Karpov has the imagination to turn a scarcely seen ripple into a victory unforeseen by others. His game against Aleksandr Khalifman in Round 7 of the Linares International Tournament, which took place in the Spanish city last month, shows his winning methods.</p>
        <p>In this rarely played move order of the King's Indian Defense, Fianchetto Variation, 5 . . . Qa5 is intended to disrupt the opponent's mobilization. But Karpov went ahead with 6 Nc3 and on 6 . . . Ne4, he had no qualms about conceding the bishop-pair with 7 Bd2 Nd2 8 Qd2, an idea he had successfully originated in a game with Jan Timman in the Euwe Memorial Tournament in Amsterdam, in 1988. He likes give up bishop for knight in exchange for a gain in time and spatial superiority in the center.</p>
        <p>Maybe the most secure defense, after 13 Rfd1, would have been 13 . . . Rac8 14 Nd5 Qd2 15 Rd2 Rfe8 16 b3 Kf8. It's passive, of course, but there are no weaknesses and it is not clear what plan can be constructed for a breakthrough by White.</p>
        <p>Before initiating a definite plan, Karpov, in typical style, seized as much space as he could, with 17 h4, 19 a4 and 21 a5. Meanwhile, he made no attempt to avoid 19 . . . Bd5 20 Bd5, bringing about bishops of opposite color. He knew that he could preserve a minute advantage despite that normally drawish factor.</p>
        <p>Khalifman stopped Karpov from opening the a file by playing 22 . . . b5, but after 23 d5, he should have played 23 . . . e5 with the idea of 24 . . . f5 and 25 . . . e4, producing a real fight for the initiative. Karpov took advantage of 23 . . . bc?! by 24 de, which created prospects of attacking the black center, no matter whether Khalifman chose to recapture with 24 . . . fe or 24 . . . Qe6, as he did.</p>
        <p>After Karpov's 35 Rb1, it is not obvious whether Khalifman could have set up a defense. In any case, his 35 . . . Qa6? indicated that he had not seen through the enemy plan of attack. It was vital for him to play 35 . . . Rd7, and if 36 Rb7, then Rcc7. At least, he would have been able to refute 37 Bc6? by 37 . . . Qa6!</p>
        <p>After 35 . . . Qa6?, Karpov penetrated with 36 Rb7!, and after 36 . . . Rf8, he converged on the weak f7 point just in time with 37 Re2 Ra5 (37 . . . Bd8 does not work: 38 Qf3 Bf6 39 Re6! Qa1 40 Rd6 permits no defense against 41 Rdd7) 38 Re3! Ra1 39 Rf3 Re1 40 Rf6! After 40 . . . Kf6 41 Qf3, Khalifman could not play 41 . . . Ke5 because of 42 Qf4 mate, and he could not play 41 . . . Kg7 because of 42 Rf7 Rf7 43 Qf7 Kh6 44 Qf8 Kh7 45 Qg8 Kh6 46 Qh8 mate. Khalifman gave up.</p>
