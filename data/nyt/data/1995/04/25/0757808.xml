        <p>The Rangers just don't make it easy on themselves or their fans. Not when they take a four-goal lead, as they did last night. Not when they drive the other team's starting goalie from the net. Not when a top opposing player leaves with an injury. Not even when the officiating prompts the opposing coach to stand up on the boards and get penalized for protesting.</p>
        <p>Yes, the Rangers had all that in their favor last night at Madison Square Garden, and still they had to hang on for a 5-4 victory over the Washington Capitals. The game ended with the Capitals firing shots at goalie Mike Richter and Ranger players mauling Capital attackers without fear of penalty from Referee Bill McCreary.</p>

        <p>The Rangers just don't make it easy on themselves or their fans. Not when they take a four-goal lead, as they did last night. Not when they drive the other team's starting goalie from the net. Not when a top opposing player leaves with an injury. Not even when the officiating prompts the opposing coach to stand up on the boards and get penalized for protesting.</p>
        <p>Yes, the Rangers had all that in their favor last night at Madison Square Garden, and still they had to hang on for a 5-4 victory over the Washington Capitals. The game ended with the Capitals firing shots at goalie Mike Richter and Ranger players mauling Capital attackers without fear of penalty from Referee Bill McCreary.</p>
        <p>Brian Noonan scored two goals for the Rangers, who held a 5-1 lead late in the second period. Dale Hunter scored twice for the Capitals, who played much of the first period shorthanded. Adam Graves, Sergei Zubov and Sergei Nemchinov scored the other goals for the Rangers. Kevin Miller and Sylvain Cote scored the others for the Capitals.</p>
        <p>The result left the Rangers with 43 points in 44 games, good for a tie with Hartford for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern Conference in the 48-game season. The Whalers have played one more game and the Rangers have one more victory, so the Rangers are ahead. Both Florida and Montreal have 41 points.</p>
        <p>Ranger Coach Colin Campbell said: "Tonight we deserved to win, but we tried to throw it away. I don't know how to explain it. We played nervous. That's not acceptable. We let them outrace us, outbattle us and outfight us."</p>
        <p>And he was the winning coach. Jim Schoenfeld, coach of the Capitals, said, "I had to calm down after a difficult loss for us." Long after the game, Washington General Manager David Poile had more to say about the officiating, behind the closed door of the referee's locker room.</p>
        <p>The Capitals hold sixth place in the conference with 45 points, 1 ahead of Buffalo and 2 ahead of the Rangers and Whalers.</p>
        <p>Jeff Beukeboom, the Ranger defenseman, didn't stress the negative as much as his coach did.</p>
        <p>"It's like golf: You don't describe the shot, you look at the scoring card," said Beukeboom, who got away with punching Peter Bondra in the head in the waning moments. "If you dwell on the negatives, you ignore the positives. Of course, you're happy with a win."</p>
        <p>Another critical noncall by McCreary came in the sixth minute of the first period, with the Rangers leading by 1-0 on Graves's power-play goal. Noonan and Nick Kypreos checked Calle Johansson in the corner and Kypreos flattened him, knocking the puck loose and the Washington player woozily to his knees.</p>
        <p>After Noonan scored, Schoenfeld stood on the bench and signaled both charging and elbowing penalties in the direction of the referee. McCreary responded by giving the Capitals a bench minor for unsportsmanlike conduct. That call resulted in the Rangers' second power-play goal, by Zubov, and a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Schoenfeld then removed goalie Jim Carey and replaced him with Olaf Kolzig. Midway through the period, McCreary called two penalties on Washington on the same play, but the Rangers failed to score on the two-man advantage.</p>
        <p>Noonan's second goal of the night, at 6 minutes 18 seconds of the second period, gave the Rangers a 4-1 lead. He followed Sergei Nemchinov's rebound after Jay Wells shot from the blue line.</p>
        <p>Nemchinov made it 5-1 at 15:41. His game-winner was set up by Aleksei Kovalev, who displayed, before and after the goal, everything that is good and bad about his game.</p>
        <p>Minutes before this, Kovalev was on the power play. He stayed on too long when sides returned to even strength and took a slashing penalty. After the Rangers killed it off, Kovalev returned, rejoined the play, burst down right wing around Sylvain Cote and set up Nemchinov with a pass across the zone. But he saw little ice time after this episode.</p>
        <p>The Washington comeback began with Miller's power-play goal in the 20th minute of the second period.</p>
        <p>"The momentum changed," said Mark Messier, captain of the defending Stanley Cup champions. "But we held on and got the important 2 points." SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>MARK TINORDI, Washington's important defenseman, left the game after the first period with a sprained right knee. He will be out for a week. . . . KEVIN LOWE, the Ranger defenseman, sat out with a pinched nerve. He was replaced by MATTIAS NORSTROM, 23 years old, who is 13 years Lowe's junior. . . . MARK MESSIER's assist streak reached seven games. . . . After giving Washington five of the first six penalties, McCreary gave the Rangers six of the next eight.  HOCKEY</p>
