        <p>Cargill Inc., one of the nation's largest food processors, and Frigoscandia, a Swedish maker of food processing equipment, said today that they had developed a method to eliminate virtually all disease-causing bacteria in beef, pork and poultry.</p>
        <p>The process uses a blanket of steam to pasteurize the surface of carcasses and could be easily inserted into meat-processing lines, the two companies said. In tests conducted since last October at Kansas State University, 99.9 percent of the bacteria was eliminated. The main target of the new technology is E. Coli 0157: H7. The process has been given preliminary approval by the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture for full-scale installation in a Cargill meatpacking plant this summer.</p>

The process has been given preliminary approval by the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture for full-scale installation in a Cargill meatpacking plant this summer.</p>
        <p>"I don't see any reason why it won't eventually be used in all of the nation's 3,000 or so meatpacking plants," said Craig Wilson, the project manager for Frigoscandia Inc., a subsidiary of the Swedish company, based in Bellevue, Wash. Cargill is based in Minneapolis.</p>
        <p>E. Coli 0157: 7 is the bacterium believed to cause about 400 deaths and illnesses in 20,000 people annually.</p>
        <p>It is not clear yet how much the new technology would cost but it uses considerably less energy and water than the hot-water bath technology now used to clean eviscerated carcasses before they are cooled.</p>
