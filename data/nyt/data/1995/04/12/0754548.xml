        <p>It was a memorable day for Tommy Salo, the 24-year-old goaltender making his National Hockey League debut, but for all the wrong reasons.</p>
        <p>He missed the team bus back to the hotel after a midday practice, then missed the boat tonight as he and the Islanders were beaten, 5-2, by the Tampa Bay Lightning before 18,922 at the ThunderDome.</p>
        <p>Three Lightning goals came in a 5-minute-31-second stretch of the second period, and that proved good enough to drop New York to 11-21-5 and reduce its playoff hopes with 11 games left to virtually zero.</p>
        <p>The victory sealed a 4-0 Tampa Bay sweep of the Islanders this season. The Lightning's only other season sweep has been against hapless Ottawa.</p>
        <p>"They've gotten some timely goals against us and they've had outstanding goaltending," said Islander Coach Lorne Henning, referring to Daren Puppa, who stopped 29 shots.</p>
        <p>Henning had a five-minute, closed-door meeting with his team afterward. "We've been shooting ourselves in the foot," he said. "It's not that we're being outhustled. We're making mental mistakes. Like turnovers in the middle."</p>
        <p>Left wing Rob Zamuner gave Tampa Bay a lead 2:25 into the second period with a straight-on 12-footer in traffic. Salo's view was blocked by teammate Paul Stanton on the shot.</p>
        <p>Next, John Tucker sneaked an ice-hugging 25-footer under Salo on a power play. Henning viewed that as the only weak goal Salo gave up.</p>
        <p>And then came the backbreaker, a short-handed goal by Zamuner.</p>
        <p>It was the fifth time in five games that New York has given up a goal while on a power play. Astonishingly, in their last 37 power-play opportunities, the Islanders have been outscored, 7-4.</p>
        <p>"I know it's not pretty," Henning said.</p>
        <p>A little later in the period, the game was held up for 12 minutes as the teams brawled. After it, the Islanders were given a five-minute power play, mainly because Tampa Bay's Enrico Ciccone registered 22 minutes in penalties.</p>
        <p>New York finally got a goal 6:38 into the final period, courtesy of right wing Zigmund Palffy. But it couldn't keep this from being among the Islanders' more forgettable performances. SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>TOMMY SALO, who helped Sweden win a gold medal at the 1992 Olympics, was recalled from Denver last Wednesday. He rejected 29 shots Tuesday night. . . . Center KIRK MULLER, also making his Islander debut after arriving in a trade with Montreal, had an active though non-scoring game. . . . Left wing BRETT LINDROS was scratched after suffering back spasms during the day. . . . Defenseman RICH PILON, out since March 5 with a sprained left ankle, is expected back either Friday or Sunday. Defenseman SCOTT LACHANCE, who suffered a broken left ankle Feb. 28, figures to be activated within a week.  HOCKEY</p>
