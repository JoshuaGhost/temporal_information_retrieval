        <p>"Stuart Saves His Family" is a two-step comedy about 12-step recovery programs, presided over by Al Franken as the amusing New Age healer he plays on "Saturday Night Live." Stuart Smalley, that grinning avatar of O.K.-ness, has his own self-help television show, where the set consists of an armchair, a mirror and backdrop of sunny sky. Thus ensconced, Stuart delivers homilies like, "It is easier to put on slippers than to carpet the world."</p>
        <p>Having fine-tuned this nicely fatuous character (and having spun off his own self-help book in the process), Mr. Franken moves on to the second step of trying to make Stuart the centerpiece of a full-length movie. But "Stuart Saves His Family" is little more than a set of intermittently funny skits strung together by a sketchy nonplot about Stuart's relatives. As directed by Harold Ramis, it's seldom better than just amiable.  It's one of too many "Saturday Night Live" spinoffs this season. And it repeats itself without the cunning of Mr. Ramis's "Groundhog Day."</p>

        <p>"Stuart Saves His Family" is a two-step comedy about 12-step recovery programs, presided over by Al Franken as the amusing New Age healer he plays on "Saturday Night Live." Stuart Smalley, that grinning avatar of O.K.-ness, has his own self-help television show, where the set consists of an armchair, a mirror and backdrop of sunny sky. Thus ensconced, Stuart delivers homilies like, "It is easier to put on slippers than to carpet the world."</p>
        <p>Having fine-tuned this nicely fatuous character (and having spun off his own self-help book in the process), Mr. Franken moves on to the second step of trying to make Stuart the centerpiece of a full-length movie. But "Stuart Saves His Family" is little more than a set of intermittently funny skits strung together by a sketchy nonplot about Stuart's relatives. As directed by Harold Ramis, it's seldom better than just amiable.  It's one of too many "Saturday Night Live" spinoffs this season. And it repeats itself without the cunning of Mr. Ramis's "Groundhog Day."</p>
        <p>Mr. Franken can write irresistible one-liners ("My father grew up in the Great Depression -- his mother's"), but he seldom shapes fully workable comic scenes. The film's wit doesn't get far beyond the sight of Stuart huddled in bed, eating cookies, while his sponsors from Al-Anon, Debtors Anonymous and Overeaters Anonymous line up outside his door to make supportive noises. Stuart's trumped-up problem is the cancellation of his television show, which means he takes a job as a waiter and answers "No!" when a customer tries to order a double scotch. Meanwhile, grateful viewers write to Stuart's boss, thanking her for taking "that simpering nutcase" off the air.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Stuart, who lisps, tells the audience that he is being "thucked inexorably toward home" to deal with "family of origin issues." His father (Harris Yulin) drinks, his mother (Shirley Knight) is an enabler, his brother (Vincent D'Onofrio) smokes pot and his sister has an eating problem. "I would never ordinarily say this," Stuart tells her at one stressful moment, "but is there any way you can get to a pound cake?"</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Franken (who also wrote "When a Man Loves a Woman") really knows his 12-step jargon, this set-up has lively possibilities.  But the plotting is surprisingly banal, involving even talk of a property easement and turning Stuart into the executor of a relative's estate. And the relatives' problems are taken semi-seriously, which is more than this lightweight film can handle.</p>
        <p>The best of "Stuart Saves His Family" shows off Mr. Franken's keen ear for his characters' huggy platitudes. "I guess you've got to accept that you never had a father," he counsels a friend (Laura San Giacomo). "So from now on, when you need one, I'll be your dad -- when you're not being my mom." Viewers at a preview screening enjoyed such moments ruefully, but a lot of them left before the film was over.</p>
        <p>"Stuart Saves His Family" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual references and mild profanity. STUART SAVES HIS FAMILY  Directed by Harold Ramis; written by Al Franken, based on his novel; director of photography, Lauro Escorel; edited by Pembroke Herring and Craig Herring; music by Marc Shaiman; production designer, Joseph T. Garrity; produced by Lorne Michaels and Trevor Albert; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 100 minutes. This film is rated PG-13. WITH: Al Franken (Stuart Smalley), Laura San Giacomo (Julia), Vincent D'Onofrio (Donnie), Shirley Knight (Mom) and Harris Yulin (Dad)  FILM REVIEW</p>
