        <p>Public Advocate Mark J. Green has never been a terribly welcome figure in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's City Hall, but yesterday he found himself banned even from a city-owned center for the elderly after the Giuliani administration decided that a forum he planned on the Republican Party's Contract With America was a political activity prohibited on city property.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Green and Thomas M. Menino, the Mayor of Boston and a fellow Democrat, met with about 40 older people on the sidewalk yesterday morning at 93d Street and First Avenue, outside the Stanley M. Isaacs Senior Center, which the Housing Authority owns. Afterward, Mr. Green charged that Ruben Franco, the chairman of the Housing Authority, had engaged in "big-brother censorship." But Mr. Franco and Mr. Giuliani said they were only trying to protect the city's Federal housing money.</p>
        <p>The dispute began on Wednesday, when Mr. Green notified the Housing Authority that he and six big-city mayors -- all Democrats -- planned to discuss the Contract With America, the Republican policy agenda that has been the focus of the first 100 days of the Congressional session, at the center. A day later, Mr. Franco called the center and said the event was prohibited, citing Housing Authority regulations that say, "In no case may community center space be used for partisan political activities."</p>
        <p>Mr. Franco informed Mr. Green as well, but the Public Advocate, a likely mayoral candidate, decided to show up anyway. He and Mr. Menino spent the morning telling older people on the sidewalk how Federal policies will affect them, and then he spent the afternoon telling reporters on the sidewalk outside City Hall about the damage done to the First Amendment.</p>
        <p>"Here we have a city official who is engaging in classic prior restraint because he has decided to ban me from speaking because of his guess about the political content of what we might say," said Mr. Green, who was joined by Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>City officials defended their decision by noting that all the mayors invited to the forum were from the same party, and suggested that only one side of the Contract With America would have been presented.</p>
        <p>"I know the mayors that were here came for a meeting that was sponsored by the Democratic National Committee to raise money," said Mr. Giuliani, explaining why the mayors had come to New York in the first place. "So it would have been very hard to escape the fact that what Mark Green was organizing here was a partisan political event."</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani himself has given the Contract With America mixed reviews, saying that he agrees with parts of it and disagrees with others.</p>
