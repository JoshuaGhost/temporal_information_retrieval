        <p>WHEN he is not happy with the powers that be in the New Mexico state government, Jacob Viarrial, the governor of Pojoaque Pueblo, has a foolproof way of turning up the heat. In a maneuver sure to stir up the environmentalists down in Santa Fe, he threatens to use the reservation, just a few miles from Santa Fe, as the site for a low-level nuclear waste dump.</p>
        <p>That is what he told former Gov. Bruce King a couple years ago when the state tried to interfere with the pueblo's plans to open a gambling hall. And that is what he threatened earlier this year, when it looked as though the legislature might allow racetracks to compete with the state's proliferating supply of Indian-owned casinos. "With different people wanting to force us out of Indian gaming, we need to look at other areas," Mr. Viarrial said in an interview last week. "Right now we're looking at low-level, but if it looks lucrative enough we might go with high-level waste."</p>

        <p>That is what he told former Gov. Bruce King a couple years ago when the state tried to interfere with the pueblo's plans to open a gambling hall. And that is what he threatened earlier this year, when it looked as though the legislature might allow racetracks to compete with the state's proliferating supply of Indian-owned casinos. "With different people wanting to force us out of Indian gaming, we need to look at other areas," Mr. Viarrial said in an interview last week. "Right now we're looking at low-level, but if it looks lucrative enough we might go with high-level waste."</p>
        <p>Since the first Earth Day, 25 years ago yesterday, America's natives have been romanticized as the original environmentalists. Millions of television viewers remember being struck (or bludgeoned) by what now is a parody of poignant public service advertising: a solemn warrior gazes tearfully at a pile of litter. How could the white man have done this to the land? When it comes to public relations, Indians have been considered good for the environment.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists and Indians sometimes find themselves on the same side, but from the beginning, their relationship has been uneasy and fraught with ambiguity. Environmentalists like to play on the image of the Indian as protector of mother earth, yet they sometimes get nervous when they see tribes making environmental decisions on their own.  The Paternal Trap</p>
        <p>"Environmentalists quite often fall into the trap of a paternalistic or romanticized approach to dealing with Indians," said Kevin Gover, a Pawnee lawyer whose Albuquerque firm represents Indians in environmental disputes. "They say, 'The poor Indians don't understand the impact, so we have to protect them.' I've actually had environmentalists tell me, 'Well, that's not the Indian thing to do.' "</p>
        <p>Several years ago Mr. Gover represented the Campo Band of Mission Indians in Southern California, who had received approval from the Environmental Protection Agency to open and manage a commercial landfill -- one of the few ways they could find to make a living from their less than hospitable land. Local environmentalists tried to block it with a bill in the California legislature that would have banned shipment of waste to the site.</p>
        <p>"Every government balances economic interests with environmental values," Mr. Gover said. And that includes Indian tribes. But many environmentalists believe the tribes, like all communities, need expert help. Native Americans are among the most unfortunate victims of environmental degradation, and their shaky economic status makes them an easy target for those who see the beautiful but often barren Indian lands as a natural dumping ground for waste that no one else will take.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Viarrial insists he's serious about nuclear waste, many environmentalists think he's just playing a game of high-stakes political poker. For now they are more worried about the Mescalero Apaches in southern New Mexico, who last month voted for a potentially lucrative plan to store the highly radioactive wastes produced by nuclear power plants.</p>
        <p>After the vote, environmentalists denounced the Mescalero government for strong-arming the tribe into reversing an earlier referendum rejecting the repository. The tribal government blamed outside agitators for misleading the people into opposing their own best interests. Fred Peso, the vice president of the tribe, said at the time that he considered opposition to the plan racist -- the assumption, he argued, was that only white people were competent to handle radioactive materials.</p>
        <p>The tensions between environmentalists and Indians go back at least as far as the late 1960's and early 1970's when the battle over Blue Lake in northern New Mexico became a national cause celebre. Taos Pueblo got the National Forest Service to return the lake, which the tribe considered sacred, but only after fighting off bands of environmentalists. For all their talk about Indians as keepers of the earth, environmentalists thought the Federal government would do a better job of managing the land.</p>
        <p>"Some environmentalists have had the feeling that Indians are not good stewards," said Stewart Udall, a former Secretary of the Interior whose law firm represents Navajo uranium miners with respiratory diseases. "I've always been critical of that."</p>
        <p>Recently, Mr. Udall noted, tribes have been sending people to school to learn to be foresters. And in the last few years, environmental movements have been springing up within Indian reservations. A group of Navajos has been fighting their tribal government's logging operations in the Chuska mountains. And the opposition to the Mescalero dump was waged not only by outsiders but by a small group of environmentally inclined Mescaleros. In many of these cases, pro-business tribal leaders find the strongest resistance in an alliance of older, more traditional members and younger Indians who were introduced to the environmental movement in college.</p>
        <p>"The Indians may have in their religion and culture a reverence for the land," Mr. Udall said. "But then they get into the pressures created by modern society. Unless they are reasonably well educated, they can't deal with them. "Now," he said, "many or them are just as sophisticated as the rest of us." The Anasazi Way</p>
        <p>Throughout history both Indians and their conquerors have found that the struggle for day-to-day survival leaves little room for long-term environmental concerns. Archeological records show that the Anasazi, ancestors to many Southwestern tribes, stayed in one place for no more than a generation. When all the firewood had been burned, the soil depleted and the game eaten or frightened away, they would move to a new place and start the cycle over again. They had no choice. There were no trucks to move timber, no farm animals to fertilize the fields.</p>
        <p>"That Indians treasured the earth and would never do anything to hurt it is not an accurate stereotype," said Jonathan Haas, the MacArthur Curator of North American Anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago. "They were in tune with the earth in that they were totally dependent on it."</p>
        <p>"Indians are people," he said. "Just like the rest of us, they do not always make the best decisions on the use of their land."  IDEAS &amp; TRENDS</p>
