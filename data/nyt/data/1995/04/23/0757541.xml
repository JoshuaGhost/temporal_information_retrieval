        <p>ON view here at City Without Walls is the sum of a good idea, art exemplifying it, and a lucid introduction -- assets seldom found under the same roof. And at a time when apparently no show is complete without a ponderous two-part title, this one is named crisply if paradoxically "The Quotidian Sublime."</p>
        <p>As explained in a brochure essay by the curator, Jon Berzinski, the premise is that while objects used and sights seen every day become overly familiar and hence all but invisible, there are ways in which they can, as it were, be born again.

        <p>ON view here at City Without Walls is the sum of a good idea, art exemplifying it, and a lucid introduction -- assets seldom found under the same roof. And at a time when apparently no show is complete without a ponderous two-part title, this one is named crisply if paradoxically "The Quotidian Sublime."</p>
        <p>As explained in a brochure essay by the curator, Jon Berzinski, the premise is that while objects used and sights seen every day become overly familiar and hence all but invisible, there are ways in which they can, as it were, be born again. An example is the long vacation that makes coming home a new, even strange experience.</p>
        <p>More to the point, though, are the artists who render the ordinary extraordinary. Historically, they begin, Mr. Berzinski says, with the ancient Greeks, whose still lifes played to the city dweller's nostalgia for the natural and simple life.</p>
        <p>Then came the Flemish painters, headed by the Van Eycks, who "freighted the commonplace with symbolic meaning" while depicting the world with painstaking accuracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berzinski suggests that their approach was rooted in the prevailing pantheistic notions about God in all things, so that "a blade of grass merited as much careful inspection and pictorial presence as a human being." It does not necessarily follow that Andrew Wyeth and other ultra-realists of the 20th century have also been propelled by pantheism.</p>
        <p>The curator is convincing when he cites Caravaggio for his "unprecedented ability to see the sacred in quotidian terms" (and vice versa) and Caspar David Friedrich as a landscapist capable of dealing with "the ordinary in a truly innovative way." But it is hard to stick with him when he introduces Duchamp and Warhol, the one for inventing the Readymade, the other for portraying Campbell's soup cans. After all, these artists were at work after the serpent of irony (probably unleashed by Duchamp) took up residence in the garden of high art.</p>
        <p>In any event, most of the eight artists chosen by Mr. Berzinski (including himself) seem closer to the innocents of the past. For instance, the painter Tim Daly transforms the turnpike flying across the marshy Meadowlands into a Whistlerian nocturne. And in a twilight scene of a white car parked askew with one door left open in similar territory, he achieves a Friedrich-like impression of foreboding.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Berzinski himself, the issue is obviously no longer one of foreboding: in his painting, the end is at hand. What at first seems to be a non-objective exercise in thick and crusty pigment bordered below by the image of brickwork turns out to be a vision of the night air turned solid by pollution. I, for one, shall never again stand on a city roof without recalling this apocalyptic but vaguely humorous comment on contemporary life.</p>
        <p>Almost as alarming are Norman Lundin's pastels. One depicts a corridor wall flanked by door frames, the other a room that is bare except for a pair of Mason jars on the floor. The real subject is emptiness, rendered with awful clarity in gray pastel with hints of pink and blue.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching Krista Van Ness's arrangements of dead birds, reptiles, insects and small mammals, visitors may wonder if the theme is not quotidian doom. These still lifes -- Landseer revisited in glass cases -- are assembled with such artistry as to suggest that death is but a pit stop, in this case on the way to an after-life in the miniature interior constructed and furnished by Jane M. Freeman. It is a loft, roughly 18 inches by 2 feet by 18 inches, containing everything needed for a creative but comfortable existence -- all to scale.</p>
        <p>Irresistible details include the animal skull hanging, O'Keeffe style, over a front door that is fitted with a minuscule chain lock in brass. On the floor nearby reposes a pair of booties. Though a master of coziness, Ms. Freeman is equally adept at constructing a vacant lot with trash, including a shopping cart. Bare trees and decaying buildings are also on the site, and parked alongside is a Checker cab from the days when the flag went down at $1.10.</p>
        <p>Christopher Minot weighs in with 13 objects each in its own made-to-measure frame, painted cream. A pencil stub, a bent nail, a bottle of Jane's Krazy Mixed-Up Salt, a withered rose, three moldy lemons: they hang together labeled with dates in gold, a testimony to the current mania for preserving anything and everything. In a separate cluster, Mr. Minot dispenses with objects altogether, framing apertures cracking with age.</p>
        <p>Arleen Schloss's video film features men demolishing a building. This is accompanied by a semi-audible discussion between the artist and the late John Cage, of which the gist appears to be that the general can, too, be deduced from the particular.</p>
        <p>Of all the show's participants, Adam Licht comes the closest to demonstrating the curator's thesis with his enormous photographs of containers rendered anonymous by a coat of paint. Among them are a plastic glue bottle, an aerosol can and two soda cans, one sweating the other dry. They stand as majestically as Easter Island figures.
