        <p>House and Senate conferees agreed today to a $3.1 billion supplemental defense appropriations bill requested by the White House but unexpectedly added a Republican-drafted provision that threatens to cut off all future loans and guarantees to Mexico.</p>
        <p>The sponsor of the amendment, Representative Christopher Cox of California, said it was in retaliation for President Clinton's refusal to provide detailed information on his financial aid plan for Mexico that Congress demanded a month ago.</p>
        <p>The measure, which would need the approval of the House and Senate, would take effect only if the Administration failed to make the documents available. "Given their lack of compliance so far, I am skeptical that they can comply," Mr. Cox said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>The Administration was already facing a deadline of Friday to provide a broad range of documents, many of them classified, about contacts with the Mexican Government and the past use of the Exchange Stabilization Fund, which President Clinton drew upon to provide the aid without Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>The fund operates under his discretion, and it is ordinarily used to stabilize the dollar in foreign exchange markets.</p>
        <p>An Administration official said that he expected that various agencies of the Government, from the Treasury to the White House, would be in "substantial compliance" with the mandate by the weekend. "This is a bit broader," the official said, "but nothing we can't work with."</p>
        <p>By attaching the new provision to the Pentagon money bill, the Republicans appeared to be trying to increase the pressure on the White House, which has urged quick passage of the military authorization.</p>
        <p>But Administration officials said tonight that it was possible that the passage of the amendment could defuse some of the pressure on the Senate on a far tougher amendment that Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York has introduced to cut off all further aid to Mexico.</p>
        <p>Senator D'Amato tried unsuccessfully to get the Senate to act on his provision, which was included in proposed midyear budget cuts, but it has not been taken up. The Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate agreed tonight on a compromise to the midyear cuts, and part of the deal was an agreement to set aside Mr. D'Amato's measure.</p>
        <p>The President moved on Jan. 31 to authorize a $20 billion loan through the Exchange Stabilization Fund to help stabilize the Mexican peso. He acted on his own after opposition mounted in Congress to an earlier plan that required its approval.</p>
        <p>Congressional leaders initially gave Mr. Clinton's initiative its blessing, but grumbling continued among both Republicans and Democrats. And Republicans in particular have sought to embarrass the Administration by demanding inquiries into what the White House and Treasury knew of Mexico's crumbling economic condition before the peso was devalued last December.</p>
        <p>By a 407 to 21 vote, the House of Representatives on March 1 adopted a Congressional resolution of inquiry that gave the White House until March 15 to provide all documents pertaining to the Mexican deal. The White House missed the deadline.</p>
        <p>Members of the House and the Senate are scheduled to begin the first major recess of the 104th Congress on Friday. Amid the pending legislation is the emergency spending bill for the Pentagon that the Congressional negotiators agreed on today. The full House and Senate are expected to vote on the measure before the recess. The money is to cover the costs of unexpected operations in Haiti, Rwanda, Bosnia, Cuba and the Persian Gulf.</p>
