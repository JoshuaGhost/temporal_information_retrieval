        <p>As yet another juror in the case was replaced, lawyers for O. J. Simpson argued today that the white cotton blanket the police placed over Nicole Brown Simpson to preserve her dignity in death sowed contamination over the crime scene and reasonable doubt over evidence linking Mr. Simpson to the killings of his former wife and one of her friends, Ronald L. Goldman.</p>
        <p>Judge Lance A. Ito gave no explanation for the latest switch in jurors, the sixth since the trial began.

        <p>As yet another juror in the case was replaced, lawyers for O. J. Simpson argued today that the white cotton blanket the police placed over Nicole Brown Simpson to preserve her dignity in death sowed contamination over the crime scene and reasonable doubt over evidence linking Mr. Simpson to the killings of his former wife and one of her friends, Ronald L. Goldman.</p>
        <p>Judge Lance A. Ito gave no explanation for the latest switch in jurors, the sixth since the trial began. Nor did he rebuke the conduct of the dismissed juror, as he did when he made his last substitution. The change was made after he learned that the dismissed juror, a 38-year-old married woman, had not been candid when asked about her own experiences with domestic violence.</p>
        <p>The juror, an employment interviewer, was replaced by a 44-year-old computer technician. With one black woman being replaced by another, the demographics of the jury do not change. But the switch nonetheless augurs well for the prosecution, substituting a woman who had expressed skepticism of police veracity with one who has said she had never known a police officer to lie.</p>
        <p>As the newly reconstituted jury listened, Mr. Simpson's lawyers continued to hammer at the way in which police officers and criminalists collected and preserved evidence in the case. Most dramatically, they theorized that Mr. Simpson, Mrs. Simpson, their children, their dog or and even Mr. Goldman might have innocently used the blanket, either in Mrs. Simpson's house or in Mr. Simpson's Bronco, covering it with hairs and fibers and human fluids.</p>
        <p>Last month Tom Lange, one of the two police detectives heading the investigation, recalled how he had directed a subordinate to remove the blanket from Mrs. Simpson's home around 7:30 A.M. on June 13, before either the coroner or a police criminalist arrived on the scene. His object, he said, was to protect her from a voyeuristic and gawking public as daylight enveloped the crime scene.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simpson's lawyers argued today that when the blanket was draped over Mrs. Simpson's body and then remained on the crime scene after coroners had "processed" her and Mr. Goldman, it became a kind of evidentiary burr, spreading seemingly incriminating contamination to everything it either touched or came close to, including a bloody leather glove, a ski cap and other items of clothing.</p>
        <p>Contaminating materials, they speculated, might have been airborne, or transferred as coroners removed the bodies from the scene, or even carried by Dennis Fung, the chief criminalist on the case and the man on the stand today.</p>
        <p>If the defense argument is bought by the jury, it could neutralize many of the critical exhibits in the case -- nearly everything, in fact, but the drops of blood at the crime scene and Mr. Simpson's house, which defense lawyers are attacking on other grounds.</p>
        <p>Today, as yesterday, the testimony pitted Mr. Fung against Barry Scheck, the New York law professor handling DNA testimony for the defense. For all his apparent gentleness, Mr. Fung was stubborn and uncontrite on most issues. But on the subject of moving the blanket, which had been installed and removed well before Mr. Fung got to the crime scene at 875 South Bundy Drive, he did not even try a defense, conceding that it was, in Mr. Scheck's words, a terrible mistake.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fung spent much of his first full day of cross-examination answering for the sins of others: how long the police took to summon criminalists to the crime scene; the failure by the police to surround Mr. Simpson's Bronco with yellow police tape; Mr. Lange's order to bring the glove found at Mr. Simpson's home onto the crime scene at Mrs. Simpson's home; the disappearance from the crime scene of a piece of paper that, Mr. Scheck speculated, "could have been ripped out of the hands of the killer."</p>
        <p>The criminalist also had to answer for the decision by police detectives to remove the victims' bodies before evidence all around them had been collected. In the process, defense lawyers suggested at day's end, the leather glove may have been dragged to the walkway, in close proximity to the contaminating blanket.</p>
        <p>"You always second-guess someone when you're going into a crime scene -- say, 'Was this done?' 'Was that done?' " Mr. Fung said. "And you ask them what was done and what wasn't done." He was referring to Mr. Lange, but he could just as easily have been speaking about himself.</p>
        <p>At various times today, Mr. Fung had to fend off accusations that he improperly delegated collecting tasks to Detective Mark Fuhrman, who found the glove at Mr. Simpson's home, that he should have pressed more insistently for more help from more senior criminalists, and that he should have videotaped the crime scene.</p>
        <p>The morning began with what has become a familiar ritual in the Simpson case. The jurors filed in as usual, but when they had all taken their seats one of them -- seat No. 7 -- remained vacant. With no fanfare or explanation, Judge Ito then asked his law clerk, Deirdre Robertson, to reach into a manila envelope and take out the number of the replacement. She did, with dispatch. "Number 795," she announced.</p>
        <p>At that moment a woman, seated adjacent to juror No. 6, stood, tripping a bit on the way up. A heavy-set woman, she negotiated her way with difficulty past the jurors in the front row, leaning on the ledge with her left hand as she made her way to her new post. For the rest of the morning, her old seat remained empty.</p>
        <p>Six alternates remain for a trial that could well last into the summer. As the weeks have passed, the alternate jurors have become subject to the same kind of countdown as those bottles of beer on the wall in the old camp song. The high attrition rate has made Judge Ito's decision to impanel an unusually large number of alternates look prescient.</p>
        <p>"I think that most of the jurors that are going to be dismissed have been dismissed," said Robert Hirschhorn, a jury consultant in Galveston, Tex. "We may get two or three more problems, but when Judge Ito gets down to the last three it's going to take a nuclear explosion to get anyone off the jury. And that's not going to happen."</p>
        <p>Sheriff's deputies escorted the excused juror out of the courthouse. During jury selection, that juror expressed doubts both about the police -- "You can't just look at a police officer and say that what he is saying is true," she said -- and Mr. Simpson's guilt when he pleaded no contest in 1989 to spousal abuse charges. "There probably would have been times when I would plead no contest, too, because the media is so vicious," she said.</p>
        <p>The new juror, who was a forewoman on a previous jury, is also far more animated and expressive than her predecessor, as one bizarre episode this morning revealed. After fighting with a man in the adjacent seat, a transvestite in the back row was unceremoniously escorted out of the courtroom.</p>
        <p>"That particular incident just spoke for itself," Judge Ito said. The remark brought laughs from several jurors, including the newest one.</p>
        <p>For the most part Mr. Fung met Mr. Scheck's attack calmly, showing no signs of fluster or embarrassment. He paused for long periods of time even when fielding simple questions, like whether he took care while looking for evidence. .</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheck attacked him vigorously. He gestured continuously, wagged his fingers aggressively and, as if conjuring up festering bacteria, crinkled his face contemptuously whenever he talked of contamination.</p>
        <p>Judge Ito, who has betrayed his irritation with Mr. Scheck in the past, gave him little slack, sustaining many objections to his questions and accusing him of repetitiousness. Once, he cut off Mr. Scheck when he resumed his questioning too quickly after a sidebar conference.</p>
        <p>"Us New Yorkers, we talk fast, we move fast," Mr. Scheck said.</p>
        <p>"Not fast enough," the judge replied in a half-sour tone.</p>
        <p>More good-naturedly, he looked askance as Mr. Scheck searched for a term to describe the fledgling criminalist working with Mr. Fung, moving from "trainee" to "novice" to "rookie."</p>
        <p>"Why don't you try 'entry level,'?" Judge Ito asked. "There have been rookies of the year who've been M.V.P.'s."</p>
