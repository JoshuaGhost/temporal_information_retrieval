        <p>Popular political wisdom has it that by next April Fool's Day, Republicans will have picked their nominee for President. The idea is that with so many primaries bunched together and scheduled earlier than ever before, the contest might be like a drive through Podunk Center, Iowa: don't blink or you'll miss the whole thing.</p>
        <p>But as the experts gear up for the quickest primary race in history, they ought to be prepared for one thing: it might not happen that way.</p>
        <p>Haley Barbour, the Republican national chairman, says a swift nominating process is likely "but a long way from a sure thing."</p>
        <p>"The schedule has been compressed and front-loaded," Mr. Barbour said, "but that doesn't preclude different people from winning different primaries."</p>
        <p>Most Republicans do not see it that way. They point to the calendar:</p>
        <p>The first votes will be cast at the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 12. Just 44 days later, after the California primary, more than 70 percent of the convention delegates will have been selected. The rapid-fire process, the argument goes, means that if a candidate picks up steam by winning the early contests, there will be no time to stop him. Many analysts even predict that the whole exercise will be wrapped up by March 12, when a cluster of Southern states hold primaries.</p>
        <p>"This thing will be over so quickly that there will be candidates who are no longer viable but don't know it," said Richard N. Bond, a former Republican national chairman who is expected to advise the campaign of Senator Bob Dole of Kansas. "They'll be like the proverbial chickens with their heads cut off."</p>
        <p>There's even a new name for all this: early closure. "I'm at a loss to find any political scientist who's arguing that front-loading of the primaries will produce anything but early closure," said Robert D. Loevy, a political science professor at Colorado College who is an authority on the primary process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bond and many other Republicans argue that Mr. Dole is in the best position to follow George Bush's 1988 strategy: triumph in the early primaries and then plow through the rest of the states.</p>
        <p>But predicting political outcomes has never been a safe pastime. What if Mr. Dole falters in New Hampshire, as he did in 1988? Or what if he carries New Hampshire and then New York, but Senator Phil Gramm of Texas carries that state and several others in the South on March 12?</p>
        <p>Or what if no front-runner emerges among the three best-financed candidates thus far -- Mr. Dole, Mr. Gramm and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee -- and Gov. Pete Wilson of California wins his delegate-rich home state on March 26? Maybe it was wishful thinking, but Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, weighed in today with his view that Mr. Gramm was best positioned to capture the nomination.</p>
        <p>There are endless scenarios.</p>
        <p>"If Dole can pursue a Bush strategy successfully, and construct a wall in the Southern regional primaries, he's in," said Stephen J. Wayne, a professor of government at Georgetown University. "But if he can't, it's an open field. And it could drag out until the convention in August. That's the worst position for the Republicans to be in: sniping with no leader."</p>
        <p>Eddie Mahe, a veteran Republican consultant, said the outcome depended as much on money, and how well that money was managed, as on the calendar. "If different candidates invest their resources in different ways," he said, "you could get to the end of March and have two or three candidates in play."</p>
        <p>A drawn-out nominating process would defy Republican tradition. The last time there was true down-to-the-wire uncertainty over a Republican nomination was 1952, when a bitter struggle was played out between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio.</p>
        <p>If the process does end by April, Republicans will find themselves in the odd position of having a nominee who is not officially nominated until four more months have passed. But party officials prefer that to the alternative.</p>
        <p>"The chairman of a party always wants a nomination process to start late and end early," Mr. Barbour said. "That way, you can get about entering the fall campaign with all your ducks in a row."</p>
        <p>But he knows better than to bet on conventional wisdom. Remembering all too well being pleasantly stunned by the Republicans' 1980 capture of the Senate, where the Democrats had held sway for a quarter of a century, Mr. Barbour said, "I don't know of anybody who saw that coming."</p>
