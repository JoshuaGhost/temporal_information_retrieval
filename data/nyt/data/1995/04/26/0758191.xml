        <p>San Antonio, 62-20, First Place, Midwest Division vs. Denver Nuggets, 41-41, Fourth Place, Midwest Division Key Players San Antonio: David Robinson has had trouble venturing into the Land of Mutombo before, but Dennis Rodman's work underneath has freed him up to score more. If Chuck Person gets hot off bench, it's over. Key Players Denver: Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf has missed 5 of last 7 games with bruised right leg and sprained right ankle. Reggie Williams and Dikembe Mutombo need to step up offensively. The rookie Jalen Rose has to neutralize Vinny Del Negro. Season Review San Antonio: Rodman's motorcycle accident notwithstanding, Spurs are unflappable on the road (29-12). After a slow start they have been on fire, winning their last six and a league-best 62 overall. Season Review Denver: Moving from the front office back onto the floor after Dan Issel and Gene Littles could not get the Nuggets to perform, Bernie Bickerstaff somehow guided them away from the lottery and into the postseason with a late rush. Prediction: Spurs won't go down like Seattle a year ago. Spurs in four. Phoenix Suns, 59-23, First Place, Pacific Division vs. Portland Trail Blazers, 44-38, Fourth place, Pacific Division Key players Phoenix: Charles Barkley imposes his will on a series like only Michael Jordan can. Whether Kevin Johnson can contain Rod Strickland is tantamount. Dan Majerle needs to find his stroke by the second round, or Suns are in trouble.  Key Players Portland: Cliff Robinson has picked up some of the scoring slack since Clyde Drexler left for Houston. Otis Thorpe has given them more bulk, but Blazers offense no longer puts a premium on creativity. Season Review Phoenix: Danny Manning's injury before all-star break cast a pall over a franchise seemingly destined for the finals. Barkley has carried their hopes for a ring on his shoulders since then. Who says you can't win the N.B.A. championship without a dominant center? Detroit and Chicago, from 1989 to 1993, that's who. Season Review Portland: New coach, new style, but they can't hide the wrinkles. Terry Porter and Buck Williams are role players now. The Blazers, once favored and omnipotent in the West, did very well to finish above .500. Prediction: Rivarly or not, it's a Sir Charles Show. Phoenix in four. Utah Jazz, 60-22, Second Place, Midwest Division vs. Houston Rockets, 47-35, Third Place, Midwest Division  Key Players Utah: League's all-time assist leader (John Stockton) and premier power forward (Karl Malone) in sync like they've never been. Key to this series, however, is Jeff Hornacek's all-around play. Key Players Houston: The Drexler Factor is huge. He can post up Hornacek and create in the open floor. Worry not for Hakeem Olajuwon, worry for his teammates. Vernon Maxwell needs to stick the open 3-pointer and Kenny Smith must play with more poise than panache. Season Review Utah: The Jazz get along on and off the floor like no other team. Chemistry may not win a title, but it certainly makes up for the lack of an All-Star center. After a brief lull, they enter playoffs as league's hottest team, having won 7 straight. Season Review Houston: They began their repeat quest with an amazing November run. What happened? Shaky backcourt, Maxwell's temper and general team malaise. May become first defending champion to get knocked off in first round since Philadelphia in 1984. Prediction: Great theater, but Utah controls tempo. Jazz in five. Seattle SuperSonics, 57-25, Second place, Pacific Division vs. Los Angeles Lakers, 48-34, Third place, Pacific Division Key Players Seattle: So many starters lingering on the bench, so few minutes. More important than Shawn Kemp and Gary Payton sparkling in this series is how well Kendall Gill and Sam Perkins defend and shoot from the perimeter. Key Players Lakers: Cedric Ceballos playing well since his return from injury. Challenge of Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones is to break the most-aggressive trapping defense in basketball. Season Review Seattle: Sonics as dangerous as Orlando when they get on a run, but also as disastrous when they fall apart offensively. Though Payton's defense and Kemp's power inside compensate, their half-court set is not up to Finals specifications after 82 games. Season Review Lakers: Jerry West has slowly rebuilt an emerging Western Conference power from the ground up. It's not Showtime II, but the Lakers may be one player away from title contention again. Prediction: Sonics lost four of five to Lakers in regular season, but wake up for the playoffs. Seattle in five.</p>
