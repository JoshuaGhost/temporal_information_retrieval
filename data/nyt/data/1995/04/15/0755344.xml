        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Conversations" with Clay Felker (Week in Review, April 9): Even when asked if a magazine about New York life had "been done before," Mr. Felker omits mention of Cue magazine, founded by my father, Mort Glankoff, in 1932.</p>
        <p>Cue was for hundreds of thousands of active, affluent New Yorkers the bible of where to go and what to do in the arts and entertainment until it was acquired by Rupert Murdoch and merged with New York magazine in 1977. Many maintain that no publication since Cue has provided as complete and reliable a consumer guide to the cultural life of New York City.</p>
        <p>Cue pioneered the field and was imitated in major cities around the world during the 1940's, 50's and 60's. True, Mr. Felker brought journalistic flair and high design to the game. But the core product -- New York's cultural vibrancy -- had been celebrated in Cue for 35 years before Clay Felker appeared.  PETER GLANKOFF  New York, April 11, 1995</p>
