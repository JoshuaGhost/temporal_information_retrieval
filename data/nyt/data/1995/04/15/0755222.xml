        <p>Negotiators for the United States and North Korea have returned to their capitals to prepare for what could be a final round of talks next week on a deal aimed at preventing North Korea from developing nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>The two sides met on Wednesday and Thursday in Berlin. Although talks had been expected to resume today, a terse announcement said they would recess until Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The United States and North Korea signed an accord in October after concern grew that North Korea was using material from its nuclear reactors to atomic weapons. The deal would provide the North with light-water reactors whose fuel cannot be used for weapons.</p>
        <p>North Korea has since said that it would not accept the $4.5 billion in new reactors from the South Korea. American diplomats have insisted that no other country is willing to shoulder the financial burden.</p>
