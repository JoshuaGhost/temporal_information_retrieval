        <p>BUDGET -- Seeking to avoid a budgetary "train wreck," Republican Congressional leaders said that they had devised a temporary spending plan that they intended to offer the White House to keep the Federal Government going for six weeks into the new fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. But the White House threw cold water on the idea immediately.</p>
        <p>"The Administration is not a part of this agreement," said a White House spokeswoman, Ginny Terzano.  MEDICAID -- Regional conflicts over the distribution of Federal Medicaid money flared as members of Congress scrutinized Republican proposals to limit the growth of the program, and Democrats complained that Republicans were trying to ram the changes through Congress.</p>
        <p>But the protests seemed unlikely to thwart House Republican leaders in their effort to eliminate the Federal guarantee of health insurance for millions of poor people and let states decide who gets what benefits. SPEED LIMITS -- The House voted, 313 to 112, to repeal the Federal speed limit of 55 miles per hour for all vehicles, turning the question of what limits, if any, there should be on motorists over to the states. The law mandating Federal speed limits was passed 21 years ago at the height of an energy crisis.</p>
        <p>The Clinton Administration has said it opposes abolishing the 55 m.p.h. limit. The differences in the House and Senate bill still must be resolved. STUDENT LOANS -- Senate Republicans split over how to cut student loans and twice postponed any votes in the Committee on Labor and Human Resources. They said they would meet on Friday.</p>
        <p>At least two Republicans, Senators Mike DeWine of Ohio and James M. Jeffords of Vermont, were unhappy with a proposal by Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican who is chairman of the committee, to raise $4.4 billion over seven years by charging colleges 2 percent of the loans they issued.</p>
