        <p>The racing spotlight, which was trained on Cigar during his 10th straight victory in the Woodward Stakes last Saturday, swung to Kentucky yesterday and fell on his chief rival: Thunder Gulch, the star of the D. Wayne Lukas stable and winner of the Kentucky Derby, who this Saturday at Turfway Park will open his countdown to the Breeders' Cup Classic.</p>
        <p>Thunder Gulch, the leading candidate for 3-year-old champion, was spending the week at the Lukas base at Churchill Downs in Louisville, where he breezed half a mile Monday in 502/5 seconds. He was joined in the workout by Serena's Song, the star filly of the stable, who did a no-nonsense half mile in 48 seconds flat.</p>

        <p>The racing spotlight, which was trained on Cigar during his 10th straight victory in the Woodward Stakes last Saturday, swung to Kentucky yesterday and fell on his chief rival: Thunder Gulch, the star of the D. Wayne Lukas stable and winner of the Kentucky Derby, who this Saturday at Turfway Park will open his countdown to the Breeders' Cup Classic.</p>
        <p>Thunder Gulch, the leading candidate for 3-year-old champion, was spending the week at the Lukas base at Churchill Downs in Louisville, where he breezed half a mile Monday in 502/5 seconds. He was joined in the workout by Serena's Song, the star filly of the stable, who did a no-nonsense half mile in 48 seconds flat.</p>
        <p>"Thunder Gulch has never been dominant in the morning," Lukas reasoned. "But I would consider his work as excellent."</p>
        <p>But even while preparing for his confrontation with Cigar in five weeks, Thunder Gulch will be reviving memories of past rivalries when he runs in the $400,000 Kentucky Cup Classic, the centerpiece of a program of seven races. His main threat may be Suave Prospect, who arrived at Turfway Park on Tuesday with his sprinting stablemate, Mr. Greeley. Both are trained by Nick Zito, who spent much of the spring and summer chasing Thunder Gulch and other horses trained by Lukas.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, some late casualties of Belmont's Super Saturday were reported. Millkom, the British winner of the Man O'War turf race, and Schossberg, second in the betting to Cigar in the Woodward, both were found to have leg injuries that will most likely end their careers.</p>
        <p>Millkom, who seemed destined to become the favorite in the Breeders' Cup Turf, was sent to the farm in Kentucky to his new owner, Gary Tanaka, who recently bought the horse, saw him win the Man O'War, then learned that the 4-year-old colt had torn the sheath covering his right front tendon.
