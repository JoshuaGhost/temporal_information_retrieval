        <p>A probationary officer attending the Police Academy was arrested yesterday and charged with hitting and robbing a cabdriver in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The probationary officer, Paul Digiglio, 21, who had been at the Police Academy since June 30, and a friend, Robert Bascetta, 19, were arrested at the Lorimer Street subway station on the L line, a few blocks from where the attack occurred, said Officer Arek Tarih, a police spokesman. He said that a third man who took part in the attack was being sought.</p>
        <p>The driver, Ahmed Iharratane, picked up three men at Astoria Boulevard and Steinway Street in Astoria, Queens, and dropped them off at 4:30 A.M. at Graham and Metropolitan Avenues in Greenpoint, Officer Tarih said.</p>
        <p>"He was giving them change, and he was hit on the head and $120 was removed from his wallet," Officer Tarih said. "The three suspects fled on foot."</p>
        <p>He said the driver followed two of the men to the subway station, then called the police, who arrested them as they stood on the station platform.</p>
        <p>Mr. Digiglio, of 534 Lorimer Street, and Mr. Bascetta, of 164 Ainsle Street, both live within four blocks of the site of the attack.</p>
        <p>The driver was not seriously hurt and was not taken to a hospital, Officer Tarih said.</p>
