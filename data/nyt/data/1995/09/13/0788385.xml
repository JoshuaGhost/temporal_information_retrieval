        <p>George Bush inexplicably seems to be amused by China's benighted handling of the international women's meeting in Beijing. On his own visit to China this week, the former President told a gathering of food executives, "I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around in China."</p>
        <p>The thoughtless remark is insulting to Ms. Abzug, but more broadly it betrays a baffling insensitivity to China's crude efforts to muzzle the women. It undercuts Hillary Rodham Clinton's strong criticism of the Chinese conduct last week.</p>

        <p>George Bush inexplicably seems to be amused by China's benighted handling of the international women's meeting in Beijing. On his own visit to China this week, the former President told a gathering of food executives, "I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around in China."</p>
        <p>The thoughtless remark is insulting to Ms. Abzug, but more broadly it betrays a baffling insensitivity to China's crude efforts to muzzle the women. It undercuts Hillary Rodham Clinton's strong criticism of the Chinese conduct last week.</p>
        <p>Ms. Abzug was a main coordinator of an unofficial forum attended by thousands of women from around the world. The Chinese authorities hounded the women with visa restrictions and intrusive police snooping and videotaping. When Mrs. Clinton addressed the forum, senior Clinton Administration officials had to shove their way past a line of Chinese security agents to attend. Mr. Bush's flippant remark makes light of such behavior, sending exactly the wrong message to China's leaders.</p>
        <p>George Bush, of all people, should know better than to make light of sensitive issues in United States-China relations at a particularly delicate moment in relations between the two countries. He surely would not have appreciated it if a predecessor had sent messages conflicting with official policy when he occupied the White House.</p>
        <p>As a private citizen, Mr. Bush is entitled to express his own views on his paid speaking tour of Asia. But as a former President and former chief American diplomat in Beijing, he should be aware that the Chinese weigh his words carefully, looking for hidden diplomatic meanings or domestic political divisions that might be exploited in forthcoming meetings with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and perhaps President Clinton himself.</p>
        <p>China's clumsy efforts to silence the women in Beijing and to wall off its own people from conference activities are not trivial matters. They are reflections of a repressive dictatorship that should make any American wary, particularly a former President.</p>
