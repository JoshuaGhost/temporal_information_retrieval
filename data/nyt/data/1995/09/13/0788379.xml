        <p>Under fire from an alumni group for returning a $20 million gift to promote the study of Western civilization, Richard Levin, the president of Yale University, has agreed to expand two programs that offer a survey of Western thought.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin's proposal is less extensive than the one sought by the original donor, Lee M. Bass, which involved the creation of a Western studies department. But it is clearly an effort to end a battle over the school's commitment to the teaching of Western civilization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin's plan calls for increasing enrollment to about 120, from 85, in a yearlong freshman program, Directed Studies, which involves an examination of the literature, philosophy, history and politics of the Western tradition. An 18-student limit on the humanities major, which is in some respects a Western studies department, would be eliminated, allowing more students to concentrate on the art, literature and history of the ancient, medieval or modern periods in Western civilization.</p>
        <p>"It would be fair to say that this is an opportunity for us to accomplish a longstanding goal and to affirm again the university's strong commitment to Western civilization," said Gary G. Fryer, a university spokesman.</p>
        <p>It remains to be seen whether the changes will satisfy the executive committee of the class of 1937, which in a May 4 letter urged Mr. Levin "to take stronger action as quickly as possible to control the heavy damage caused by the failure of the Bass grant and the attendant publicity."</p>
        <p>The letter added that many class members, who have been among Yale's most generous supporters, "are so turned off by the mishandling of the Bass grant that they intend to stop giving to Yale (except possibly gifts with restrictions that cannot be evaded)." Perry Bass, Lee Bass's father, is a member of the class of 1937.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Levin unveiled his proposal in a speech on Friday at the Yale Club in Manhattan, John B. Stevens, a member of the executive committee, told The Associated Press, "It's not enough." Mr. Stevens and other executive committee members did not return calls seeking further comment.</p>
        <p>Conservative critics maintain that many students are not learning the fundamentals of Western thought and that a substantial shift must occur in Yale's approach. And in the May 4 letter, the executive committee of the class of 1937 appeared to agree.</p>
        <p>"Our classmates ask: If women's studies can be a major, and African and African-American studies can be a major, why not a Western studies major?" the letter said.</p>
        <p>The roots of the dispute can be traced to 1991, when Mr. Levin's predecessor, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., asked Lee Bass for $20 million to start a Western studies department. After Mr. Schmidt left, the initiative was in limbo, and little was done for three years, an administrative blunder that Yale now acknowledges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin has said that he was ready to start a program that would meet the conditions of the grant but that a frustrated Mr. Bass added a new term that Yale could not accept: that he be allowed to approve faculty appointments for the new courses.</p>
        <p>Since returning the $20 million in March, Mr. Levin has said that the university provides its 5,000 undergraduates with ample opportunities to study the classics, offering 100 courses that focus on Western philosophy, history, art and music.</p>
        <p>And university officials said the decision to expand these programs should not be interpreted as the university conceding any deficiencies.</p>
        <p>"We already have a rich pool of Western civilization courses at Yale," Mr. Fryer said. "Is it necessary to add more? No, it isn't. But this isn't a place that does just what's necessary. And to the extent we can find resources to broaden and deepen already excellent academic programs, we will do it."</p>
        <p>Along with recommending an expansion in the Directed Studies to allow all interested students into the program, the letters from the class of 1937 also called for establishing a Western studies major; appointing a committee of experts to oversee Yale's commitment to Western civilization with alumni participating in its selection, and designating a campus building as a center for Western civilization.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fryer said the university has not ruled out these ideas.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Levin's plan, the university will hire six post-doctoral fellows, three-year positions, to teach the additional students in Directed Studies. That expansion would cost about $400,000 annually, and the school will embark on a drive to raise the $5 million needed for the endowment to generate that on a yearly basis.</p>
        <p>The opening of the humanities major beyond the 18-student limit is not expected to raise costs significantly.</p>
