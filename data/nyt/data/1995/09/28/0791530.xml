        <p>The Miller Brewing Company has decided that its Miller Genuine Draft beer account, with billings estimated at $75 million, will remain at the Bates U.S.A. unit of Bates Worldwide in New York, advertising executives with knowledge of the decision said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The executives said Miller, a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, had decided to keep the account at Bates following a review that was narrowed to Bates, the St. Louis office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles and Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York, a unit of the WPP Group. The account includes light and red versions of Genuine Draft as well as the parent brand.</p>

        <p>The Miller Brewing Company has decided that its Miller Genuine Draft beer account, with billings estimated at $75 million, will remain at the Bates U.S.A. unit of Bates Worldwide in New York, advertising executives with knowledge of the decision said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The executives said Miller, a unit of the Philip Morris Companies, had decided to keep the account at Bates following a review that was narrowed to Bates, the St. Louis office of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles and Ogilvy &amp; Mather New York, a unit of the WPP Group. The account includes light and red versions of Genuine Draft as well as the parent brand.</p>
        <p>Though Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman for Miller in Milwaukee, declined to acknowledge there had been a review, citing company policy, she said: "Bates has been our agency of record. They are our agency of record. And they will continue to be our agency of record."</p>
        <p>In a memo to Bates employees, Michael Bungey, chairman and chief executive of Bates, a unit of Cordiant P.L.C., said Miller had decided to "reaffirm its commitment to our recommendations and plans for Miller Genuine Draft in 1996." Bates executives were anxious to retain the important account after losing large clients like Mars Inc. and Frank Assumma, the top executive on the account, who resigned on Friday to become chairman and chief executive of the Wells Rich Greene BDDP Communications unit of BDDP Worldwide in New York.</p>
