        <p>I guess I'm one of the "the very few radical people" that one Sag Harbor merchant in the story about the Vuitton old-car show in Sag Harbor said are against the event. Your reporter somehow missed the fact that more than 700 people had by that time signed a petition against the event. Sag Harbor's total year-round population is 2,100. By my count, a third of the population of Sag Harbor has to be called "very radical." The number, by the way, continues to rise.</p>
        <p>The story also referred to the Chamber of Commerce-sponsored crafts fairs at Marine Park; a benefit for the Bay Street Theater, which also closed Marine park for two days and brought in several hundred extra bodies; an antiques show at the Whaling Museum, as well as an event next door on the grounds of the Old Customs House. That's in addition to the antique show at Mashashimuet Park, and oh, yes, the flea market at the Whaling Museum, both August events.</p>

That's in addition to the antique show at Mashashimuet Park, and oh, yes, the flea market at the Whaling Museum, both August events.</p>
        <p>As for the "assertions" that Mayor Hance dismissed as "basically political": They are statements of fact. I was at the Village Board meeting when he cut people off after two minutes, with the exception of one speaker, who was allowed to speak for three, and another who spoke for five -- on a totally different subject.  By the Mayor's reckoning, I guess if you call a fact a fact, it's "political."</p>
        <p>Your story, furthermore, did not fully list the people who took advantage of Vuitton's largess and were guests in San Diego for the Vuitton Cup in connection with the America's Cup.</p>
        <p>Michael Burke, president of Louis Vuitton North America, suggests in the story that we can go downtown when Main Street is closed to traffic and experience the pleasure of "rediscovering Main Street." Amidst the 10,000 tourists he plans to bus in? Only later in the season, he says, do "the hordes descend on Sag Harbor." What do his 10,000 a day sound like if not a "horde?"</p>
        <p>Your report also gives the erroneous impression that all the merchants are in favor of this event, when, in fact, many are openly opposed to it and some have signed the petition against it. So who is in favor of this event? "A very few radical" merchants who seem to be the only people who have the mayor's ear. LORRAINE DUSKY Sag Harbor</p>
