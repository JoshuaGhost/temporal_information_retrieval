        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Like Robert Lipsyte ("Jury Duty, Part Two: The Fight on Lenox," Aug. 13), I, too, was a juror on a case over which Judge Leslie Crocker Snyder presided. My jury was far more mixed racially than the one Mr. Lipsyte served on, but its members were well educated and our case, too, involved a crack addict. As in Mr. Lipsyte's case, the jurors were favorably impressed by Justice Snyder. However, I left the case feeling I could not sit on a criminal case again because I had unwillingly been made a participant in a system that was not conducive to truly doing justice. All the jurors took their responsibilities seriously. We were told to be the ones to determine the facts but we were then exposed to a system whose purpose seemed to be to cover up the facts. Over the centuries the jury system has evolved from one in which jurors were required to know the participants to one in which any knowledge of any participants at the trial is forbidden. It is time for further evolution. PATRICIA J. F. ROSOF  Manhattan</p>
