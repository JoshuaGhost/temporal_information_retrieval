        <p>Just when "The Promise," a story of lovers separated by the Berlin wall for nearly three decades, threatens to turn into a teary-eyed descendant of "Dr. Zhivago," the movie thinks twice about painting the relationship as an epic, star-crossed romance. Instead of assuming the stature of Zhivago and Lara, that film's lovers, Konrad and Sophie are shown to be ordinary mortals whose thorny personality quirks make them a questionable match. When the wall finally comes down and the pair, now in their 40's, exchange soulful gazes, one is reminded of the adage that absence makes the heart grow fonder.</p>
        <p>Margarethe von Trotta, who directed "The Promise," seems to want to have it both ways. The film's double vision of characters who seem like heroic constructs one minute and complicated, fallible humans the next makes "The Promise" something more than a classy historical tear-jerker. At the same time, the movie never becomes the incisive exploration of the relationship between politics and personal psychology it sometimes aspires to be.</p>
        <p>"The Promise," which opens today at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, begins with a powerful montage of news clips showing the building of the wall in 1961. From there, it zeroes in on the teen-age Sophie (Meret Becker) and Konrad (Anian Zollner) dreamily swaying together at an East Berlin dance. Plans have already been made for the lovers to escape with two companions to the West through the city's sewers. But when the moment comes for Konrad to duck into a manhole, he falters long enough to be left behind.</p>
        <p>Sophie's impulsiveness and Konrad's timidity become the characters' defining traits. After showing what happens to the lovers (Sophie lives with her aunt, a fashion designer, and Konrad becomes an East Berlin border guard), the movie jumps ahead to 1968. Konrad, a promising astrophysicist, has secretly arranged to meet Sophie in Prague, where he is giving an address.</p>
        <p>The film offers a deliriously rosy picture of the Czech capital during the so-called Prague Spring. Going giddy at the lovers' reunion, the camera swirls around them and the violins rise, as Konrad carries Sophie up the stairs to his hotel room. During their short-lived idyll, Sophie becomes pregnant, and the lovers dream of staying together in Prague.</p>
        <p>That hope is dashed when Soviet tanks roll into the city to crush the country's nascent democracy movement. And once again, their personality differences cause them to be separated. As Sophie rushes into the street to protest, Konrad hangs back in a cafe.</p>
        <p>The story takes two more giant leaps forward. Jumping to 1980, it finds Konrad and Sophie living with other partners in opposite halves of the divided Berlin. Konrad, who has reached the top of his profession, is allowed to visit the West, where he at last meets his 12-year-old son, Alexander (Christian Herrschmann). Despite their other relationships, Sophie and Konrad still carry a torch.</p>
        <p>In jumping ahead 12 years, the film switches actors. Corinna Harfouch and August Zirner, who play the mature lovers, bear such remarkable physical resemblances to those playing the younger Konrad and Sophie that it's almost possible to imagine that the director waited for a decade for the original actors to grow older.</p>
        <p>This segment of the movie builds a complicated subplot in which the Communist authorities use Alexander to manipulate Conrad's politically dissident sister, Barbara (Eva Mattes), and her husband, Harald (Hans Kremer), with a fiendish coldheartedness.</p>
        <p>In its final leap ahead, it is 1989, and the Berlin wall is torn down.</p>
        <p>With its 30-year span and its host of subsidiary characters who appear, only to vanish as the movie speeds along, "The Promise" is too episodic to fully convey the grand sweep of history and leaves many threads dangling. It is more successful in contrasting the fuzzy bureaucratized paranoia of life in the Communist bloc with the more affluent and carefree style of the West.</p>
        <p>The film takes a decidedly European view of the East-West split. In its sketches of East German Communist functionaries, it goes out of its way to suggest the moral ambivalence of people who chose Communism because it was a clear alternative to Nazism. One minor character passionately argues that staying in the West would have entailed his working with former Nazis.</p>
        <p>Generally speaking, "The Promise" is gentle in its laying of praise and blame, Without pushing the point, it suggests that Konrad is weak and credulous in comparison with Sophie.</p>
        <p>"I organized your escape, but you never showed up," she accuses him moments after they reunite in Prague. A few kisses later, she seems to have bought his excuses. The pair still make a sympathetic couple. Both actors playing Konrad affect the poetic, watery-eyed gaze and trembling half-smile of Omar Sharif's Zhivago. The two actresses playing Sophie make her evolution from headstrong romantic girl into disappointed woman entirely believable.</p>
        <p>The film's most touching moments aren't so much personal as historical. The joyous final scene, in which surging crowds of East Berliners stream into the West, is a reminder that amid all the carnage of the late 20th century, some good things have happened.</p>
        <p>"The Promise" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations.</p>
