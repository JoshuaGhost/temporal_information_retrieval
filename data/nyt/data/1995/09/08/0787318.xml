        <p>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company will introduce its own brand of denim apparel using the notion of an incognito celebrity. The actor Bruce Willis will be featured in a promotion for the new Canyon River Blues clothing line as Bruno, the name he uses when performing as a singer.</p>
        <p>"Bruno epitomizes someone who is very successful but also does it his way," John H. Costello, senior executive vice president for marketing at Sears in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said yesterday. He declined to discuss how much Sears is paying Mr. Willis, who has not appeared in American ads since endorsing Seagram wine coolers in the late 1980's. As for the introductory budget, Mr. Costello described it as "a multimillion-dollar part" of the Sears account at the Young &amp; Rubicam New York unit of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., where Sears spends $40 million annually to promote "the softer side of Sears."</p>

        <p>Canyon River Blues will compete against brands like Levi's and Lee sold by Sears as well as private-label clothing like Arizona jeans sold by J. C. Penney. In the promotion, Sears customers who correctly guess "Who is Bruno?" can win trips to an Oct. 21 performance by Mr. Willis and his band at the Planet Hollywood restaurant in Manhattan. He will also be the unidentified voice-over announcer in a commercial filled with denim-clad young hunks, which begins running on Sunday.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA</p>
