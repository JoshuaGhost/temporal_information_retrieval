        <p>A mere mile north of the Capitol, up in the Shaw neighborhood's poverty ghetto, the Rev. Jim Dickerson wonders aloud about politicians' enviable power to find certainty in fresh hyperbole.</p>
        <p>"They're locked in an ideological battle that's out of touch with the reality down here on the streets," said Mr. Dickerson, a local pastor as steeped in the intricate problems of the poor as any downtown professional is in the arcana of special-interest lobbying.</p>

        <p>A mere mile north of the Capitol, up in the Shaw neighborhood's poverty ghetto, the Rev. Jim Dickerson wonders aloud about politicians' enviable power to find certainty in fresh hyperbole.</p>
        <p>"They're locked in an ideological battle that's out of touch with the reality down here on the streets," said Mr. Dickerson, a local pastor as steeped in the intricate problems of the poor as any downtown professional is in the arcana of special-interest lobbying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickerson, whose scorn of welfare dependence is visceral, started organizing the poor 35 years ago as a Christian minister, when the cliche was "the war on poverty" and politicians backed it big. Now, still in the same rough neighborhood, he has survived long enough to see the latest Congress delivering on the "Gingrich revolution" of multiple cutbacks for the poor. It disheartens him not for the motive so much as the lawmakers' scant interest in actually looking into the good effects of the old, suddenly dying social strategy.</p>
        <p>"The people doing away with these programs have never been here, never seen the work the money has done," said Mr. Dickerson, standing in the lobby of the Whitelaw Hotel, an exemplar of the Shaw neighborhood's slow, steady attempt to rise from the ashes of the 1968 urban riots.</p>
        <p>The Whitelaw was built by pioneer black entrepreneurs at the turn of the century and gutted by poverty and drugs, crime and fire in the modern crisis of the cities. But it stands handsomely renewed now and occupied for the last three years by 35 welfare-free, working-poor families. Their arrival upward was made possible through a Federal community development program that allows tax credits to private-sector developers in building 110,000 apartments a year, more than 90 percent of the nation's new low-income housing.</p>
        <p>"Amazing," said Mr. Dickerson, speaking not of the program's results but of the fact that it has just been threatened in the dramatic swoop of general cutbacks in programs for the poor that is moving rapidly through both houses of Congress. The housing tax credit and a companion program that requires banks to take part in urban renewal by extending mortgage loans in low-income neighborhoods are on the budget-cutting block. In their vulnerability, they are largely overlooked in the more melodramatic debate over unwed mothers on welfare and the passion to end traditional Federal guarantees of minimal help to the poor.</p>
        <p>"The politicians have never seen the people positively affected by this, the community transformed," Mr.  Dickerson continued, his voice echoing in the restored lobby of the Whitelaw, a landmark in the city's black history. "If they did, they could not in any good conscience take this away."</p>
        <p>Like community development professionals in poor neighborhoods across the United States, from large renewed swaths of the South Bronx to Shaw's wobbly resurrection here, Mr. Dickerson was speaking in open despair at the notion that the low-income housing tax credit program has few defenders, either in Congress or in the embattled Federal bureaucracy, since it is rooted too locally, too undramatically.</p>
        <p>"The poor are going to get a huge pay cut this year, and its going to come in a variety of forms," noted Paul S. Grogan, president of the Local Initiatives Support Coalition, an intermediary group that helps channel expertise and resources to nonprofit community development sponsors in impoverished areas. "But we don't have enough good programs to part with this one; that's the insanity of it," he said, describing the move against developers' housing tax credit as an act of "carnage."</p>
        <p>Critics in Congress insist the credit program is a hangover from the era of overly generous Federal tax shelters open to large-scale corruption. They want to "sunset" the program with a tentative closing two years hence, a device community development professionals say might help the new Congress find budget savings on paper but would instantly freeze construction of all new low-income housing in the nation.</p>
        <p>"The change will be dramatic and it will be stark," said Mr. Grogan, drawing a contrast with welfare cutbacks whose effects might prove less discernible than a sudden stop in low-income housing construction. "This program is the engine that has allowed a great deal of neighborhood stabilization to occur."</p>
        <p>Up in Shaw, Mr. Dickerson is desperately inviting any and all lawmakers to come and see the Whitelaw before voting the sunset of the program. "No one is more opposed to the dependency system than the families in the Whitelaw," he said, expressing wonder at how sweeping and indiscriminate politicians can be in delivering on promises of change.</p>
        <p>"They're isolated," he said of those politicians. "They're encapsulated."</p>
