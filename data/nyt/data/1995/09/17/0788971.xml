        <p>Where Was the Chariot?</p>
        <p>CHARLTON HESTON parted Main Street in Huntington last weekend. On one side of the thoroughfare legions of Heston fans lined the sidewalk as far as the eye could see. On the other side a few Huntingtonites tried to go about their shopping chores. Moses may have come to town, but it was Saturday, and the dry cleaning had to be picked up.</p>
        <p>So not everyone who lived in the village and neighboring towns lined up to see Mr. Heston, although it appeared that way. The star was in Suffolk to promote his autobiography, "In the Arena." His assignment was to sign books at Book Revue, where the owners, the brothers Klein, Robert and Richard, had prepared as best they could. But the popularity of Mr. Heston overwhelmed them.</p>
        <p>"This is the most chaotic ever," Robert Klein said as fans hid behind book stacks clutching their cameras and "Ben-Hur" records. It was as if Mr. Heston and his wife of 51 years, Lydia, were royalty. The street burst into applause as the couple arrived. Another rousing hand was given to Mr. Heston as he sat down to sign. Fans were old, young and in uniform. A Suffolk County police officer, Ted Tierny, stopped by to check on crowd control and stayed to gaze at Mr. Heston.</p>
        <p>"I guess I reach across all ages," Mr. Heston said. But not geographical areas. The star has never lived on Long Island, he said, and rarely visited. But Mrs. Heston said her great-great-great grandfather's first cousin was the Huntington who founded Huntington.</p>
        <p>Waiting in Huntington since 6 A.M. was Larry Ritchie, 29, of Lynbrook. "My grandfather worked at Paramount and he knew Mr. Heston," Mr. Ritchie said. "He's a great man , and I know if my grandfather was alive he'd be here today."</p>
        <p>June Riehl drove from Montauk. "I've been a fan since the 50's," she said. "He is so good looking."</p>
        <p>But Mr. Heston is much older now.</p>
        <p>"So am I," she said.</p>
        <p>Anne Donnelly of Jamesport took Rhett Butler to the signing. Rhett, a 10-month-old black Scottish terrier, was excited at the prospect of seeing a real star, Ms. Donnelly said. The meeting would go well, she predicted, "because he is so well behaved." The dog, not Mr. Heston, although the actor behaved impressively, too.</p>
        <p>After writing "Charlton" across the page, Mr. Heston made eye contact with each of his fans, then enveloped them in a broad smile and shook their hands. Women trembled. Men did, too. Mr. Heston was bigger than life.</p>
        <p>Helen Fey of Huntington reverently clutched her book after Mr. Heston had signed it. "The most memorable moment in my life," she told him, "was seeing your bare tushie in 'Planet of the Apes.' "</p>
        <p>Cecile Hartman of Northport traveled to the store to gawk, not to buy. "How often do you get to see Charlton Heston in Huntington?" she asked.</p>
        <p>That may explain why the book-signing line snaked almost to Lloyd Neck. On it Howard Rubin of Hicksville and Marie Demeri were trying to name seven Heston movies. "What was that one with all the slime?" Mr. Rubin asked.</p>
        <p>At the end of the line stood a bookstore employee, Jim Pierce. "I'm in charge of crowd control," he said. Not that Mr. Heston's fans were like Metallica's. "But I'm trying to keep them all happy," he said.</p>
        <p>He told an elegantly dressed elderly man, John McCall, that he was standing 1 hour and 45 minutes from Mr. Heston. It was like waiting at Disney World.</p>
        <p>"I think we should do a sing-along," Mr. Pierce said. New Hamptons Hangout</p>
        <p>East Hampton is going to have a recreation center. And you thought the entire town was one big recreational center.</p>
        <p>Well, it is for those over 30, said David Silver, a resident and businessman. But Mr. Silver is concerned with the younger residents. So much so that he and his wife, Patti, started a foundation to provide college scholarships for local students in need. Without fanfare the Silvers have put 10 East Hampton High School students through college.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Silver is spearheading the drive to build a recreation center. "Because after the summer what can the kids do?" he asked. "There's really no place for them to go. So they just mill around in parking lots."</p>
        <p>The village has committed to using a centrally located site, he said, and officials have agreed to budget $500,000 a year for the center. Charles Gwathemy, the architect, will design the building. All Mr. Silver has to do is raise $4 million to build it. A bowlathon will not do. The resources of summer residents, however, may. Mr. Silver said the center could operate as early as 1997. "We have such a diversity of cultures in East Hampton," he said. "I hope this will bring everyone together."</p>
        <p>The center will include a multipurpose room with computers, a gymnasium and, yes, an indoor pool. Not because every Hamptons building has one. "But because," Mr. Silver said, "this is a community surrounded by water, and we have no public place where kids can learn to swim." Celebrities' Gift</p>
        <p>An extra 250 people dined on the pasta salad and peach crisp from the wedding last weekend of Billy Baldwin, the actor, and Chynna Phillips, the singer. Mr. Baldwin and Ms. Phillips donated the leftovers from their reception in Water Mill to Island Harvest, which transfers surplus food to the needy. "This is our first celebrity wedding," said Linda Breitstone, founder and guiding spirit of the volunteer organization.</p>
        <p>So tell us all. Did the Baldwin brothers do the electric slide?</p>
        <p>"Oh, we weren't there for the gossip," Ms. Breitstone said. "We were there for the food. And we can't take the food until it's been refrigerated."</p>
        <p>Which meant that the Island Harvest volunteers, Rivalyn Zweig and Mary Ann Tupper, never attended the reception. "They picked up the food at the caterers," Ms. Breitstone said. Loaves and Fishes prepared the feast and meticulously refrigerated and sealed up the leftovers.</p>
        <p>"We received 250 pounds of food," Ms. Breitstone said. "Pasta and bean salads, beef, chicken, peach crisps and all sorts of breads." Everything except the wedding cake. "It must have all been eaten," she said.</p>
        <p>The food went to the Retreat, a shelter domestic-violence victims; the Human Resources Program in Southampton, and the Apple drug-rehabilitation center in Wainscott. "This was a terrific thing for Billy Baldwin and Chynna Phillips to do," Ms. Breitstone said. "But from what I understandBilly is a very conservation-involved-type person. So this was just perfect. He recycled his food -- from those who have to those who don't have enough."</p>
