        <p>Low- and middle-income neighborhoods in New York City will lose seven bank branches because of the pending merger of Chemical and Chase Manhattan banks, a Chemical official announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The two banks now have 95 branches in these neighborhoods, but that number will be reduced to 88 when the 7 branches -- none more than two blocks from another -- are consolidated. Two closings are to take place in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, two in Queens and one in Manhattan. Two Bronx branches within three blocks of another branch will become primarily automated teller machine operations.</p>

        <p>Low- and middle-income neighborhoods in New York City will lose seven bank branches because of the pending merger of Chemical and Chase Manhattan banks, a Chemical official announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The two banks now have 95 branches in these neighborhoods, but that number will be reduced to 88 when the 7 branches -- none more than two blocks from another -- are consolidated. Two closings are to take place in the Bronx, two in Brooklyn, two in Queens and one in Manhattan. Two Bronx branches within three blocks of another branch will become primarily automated teller machine operations.</p>
        <p>"We took a very conservative approach," said Carol Parry, Chemical Bank's managing director for community development. "We want to make sure we maintain a high level of service in these communities."</p>
        <p>Ms. Parry also announced that 46 new A.T.M.'s would be installed in such neighborhoods, virtually all of them in New York City.</p>
        <p>Matthew Lee, executive director of Inner City Press/Community on the Move, a community group in the South Bronx, said it planned to legally challenge the Chemical-Chase merger. "There's nothing positive in this announcement," he said of yesterday's disclosure.</p>
        <p>The announcement from Chemical was also greeted with skepticism by Bertha Lewis, head organizer and director of loan counseling and banking for the community-based nonprofit organization Brooklyn Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn. She said:</p>
        <p>"That commitment may stand for today in a press release. But how long is that commitment for?"</p>
        <p>She added, "An A.T.M. does not full service make."</p>
        <p>The $10 billion merger, which is subject to regulatory approval, is to result in the closing of 100 of the two banks' 531 full-service branches.</p>
        <p>Under the Federal Community Reinvestment Act, banks are required to lend in areas where they take deposits. Because regulators can block mergers by banks that do not comply with the act, many community groups have found that protesting mergers can be among the most effective ways to attract bank funds to their areas.</p>
        <p>Ms. Parry said that Federal standards define a "low and moderate income" neighborhood in New York City and Westchester as one in which the median family income is $30,000 or less.</p>
