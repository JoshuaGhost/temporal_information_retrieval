        <p>THIS September means back to school, back to work and -- where the Federal Government and the television industry intersect -- back to the future.</p>
        <p>The debate about how television sets will change in the next century and who will foot the bill has been picked up again in Washington, and it's a little like watching the children clean their room: every time you look inside, the contents have been rearranged in new but equally jumbled ways.</p>
        <p>Take last week. Senator Larry Pressler, the South Dakota Republican who heads the Senate Commerce Committee, has staunchly opposed Federal financing for the public broadcasting system. But on Thursday he said he would approve giving $4 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for an endowment that could then support PBS in the future.</p>
        <p>And where would that money come from? From auctioning off "new spectrum," or sections of the airwaves, an idea that had been left for dead in the House Commerce Committee's version of the budget bill.</p>
        <p>To the general viewer, terms like spectrum and megahertz and digital compression can make the brain hurt. Terms like pay cable versus free TV, however, are perfectly clear. So is the cost of a new television set, which everyone will have to buy once broadcast technology converts from analog to digital signals sometime early in the next century.</p>
        <p>This fall the Government is grappling with four major "room cleaning" projects, two in Congress and two at the Federal Communications Commission. All four will affect how much consumers will pay for their inevitable new digital TV sets, how much viewers will pay for the programs that will appear on the sets and how much of that programming will serve any identifiable public interest.</p>
        <p>In Congress, the overall budget-making process requires the commerce committees in each chamber to find ways to raise about $14 billion from the auction of telecommunications airwaves by 2002 to help balance the budget.</p>
        <p>In addition, bills that would vastly deregulate the telecommunications industry have passed the House and Senate. They await a conference committee to reconcile them and send a finished bill to President Clinton, who has criticized both bills as anticompetitive and favoring the largest communications companies.</p>
        <p>The would-be budget-balancers love the idea of selling the airwaves to commercial broadcasters, who have traditionally received them free.</p>
        <p>With digital compression, the signals that produce a TV set's picture can be sent so much more efficiently that each channel will be able to transmit as many as five or six sub-channels. (Digital compression could also produce a high-definition picture, much sharper than present television, but it would require most of the channel's new capacity to do that, leaving little room for sub-channels.)</p>
        <p>Thus, owning five or six channels in one makes broadcast television stations more valuable, and why not make stations pay for that added value?</p>
        <p>Broadcasters say the investment they have to make in this new technology -- not to mention in developing programs for all those channels -- is burden enough when they are providing a free service to consumers (paid for by advertising). They must meet certain public interest requirements, like providing news and community-service programs, and they face increasingly intense competition from cable networks that show entertainment, sports and movies without any sort of public-service requirement or Government fee.</p>
        <p>Robert C. Wright, president of NBC, complained to Senator Pressler's committee on Tuesday that long-distance and local telephone companies use the airwaves, as do cellular phone companies, cable companies and satellite services without charge.</p>
        <p>"Ironically it is free, universal over-the-air broadcasting that is being singled out and asked to pay for spectrum in order to stay in business," he said.</p>
        <p>A more politically palatable proposal than Mr. Pressler's comes from the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications, whose chairman is Representative Jack Fields, Republican of Texas. It would give new channel space to broadcasters so they can gradually convert to digital transmission, and after a period of years they would be required to return the old analog channels to the Government, which could auction them to raise billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, and hardly unrelated, two so-called mega-mergers are under consideration at the F.C.C., which must decide whether to waive regulations about how many stations a single company can own. One is the proposed acquisition of CBS by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, for about $5.4 billion, the other that of Capital Cities/ABC by the Walt Disney Company, for about $19 million.</p>
        <p>The F.C.C. also has a proposed rule on the table -- the discussion period ends Oct. 15 -- that would require broadcasters to provide a certain amount of children's educational or informational programming each week as a condition for keeping their licenses. Reed E. Hundt, the commission's chairman, thinks this is a minimal public-interest obligation, but the other four F.C.C. commissioners aren't sure they agree.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Westinghouse executives met with Mr. Hundt and, according to several sources, offered to voluntarily provide more children's programming; the suspicion was that this would assure approval for the purchase of CBS. Commissioner James Quello then released an angry statement accusing Mr. Hundt of "administrative extortion," and of trying to achieve through a closed-meeting deal with Westinghouse what he might not get from the commission's vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hundt could not be reached for comment on Mr. Quello's accusation. But he has made a crusade of pressing broadcasters to uphold their public-interest obligations, especially in children's programming.</p>
        <p>He said earlier in the week that broadcasters had a "powerful argument" for being exempted from paying for new space on the airwaves.</p>
        <p>He added: "That is to say to Congress, 'No. 1, we would use the digital airwaves to deliver a multichannel package of programming that competes with cable but is free to the consumer, and No. 2, we would guarantee that for free you would get educational television for kids.' That would make a $30 billion transfer of airwaves desirable to the American people, as a pocketbook matter and as a matter of social goals."</p>
        <p>But whether to make stations pay for their new spectrum options with cash or with public-service programming, or not pay for it at all, is not Mr. Hundt's decision to make. It's Congress's.  MEDIA: TELEVISION</p>
