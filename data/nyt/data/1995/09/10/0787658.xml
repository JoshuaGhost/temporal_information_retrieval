        <p>GARDENERS in the Northeast will not soon forget the summer of '95 -- no rain, prolonged heat spells and high humidity. Everything turned droopy, then brittle under the onslaught, even the weeds.</p>
        <p>The most obvious evidence of the season's severity is the suburban lawn. It turned to straw. But this is the least of the homeowner's worries. The grass is simply dormant. Deep rooted, to depths of six feet and more, these plants should easily survive.</p>
        <p>One thing in their favor is a natural mechanism that forces them into summer dormancy. This alone is a major reason for not watering the lawn. Why waste water on plants that naturally take the summer off? Dormancy is their survival mechanism and they don't need to be stirred back into greenness just to please the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>As pathetic as the straw lawn may appear, remember that "the Golden West" referred not to sunsets but to sheaves of golden grass waving on the hillsides.</p>
        <p>Lawn grasses should stir again and return to green as soon as sufficient rain appears. And if there is not sufficient rainfall by the time cool weather comes, not to worry. The lawn can and will continue its dormancy and not come back until next spring.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there are much more serious things to worry about -- notably, the health of the woody ornamentals. These are nearer the point of possible damage. Many of the most popular ones have shallow root systems, meaning susceptibity to damage not only from soil dryness but also from high soil temperatures. And there have been plenty of days this summer the soil felt just plain hot, like sand on a beach.</p>
        <p>Particularly vulnerable to damage are dogwoods, Japanese maples and many conifers. Many shrubs have shallow roots, too, particularly rhododendrons, azaleas, mountain laurels, pieris, leucothoe and daphne.</p>
        <p>These plants should receive first priority when the garden hose is in use. Not just a teasing sprinkling of water, either, but a deep soaking. That is a hose running at a slow trickle, left in place near the root zone for up to a half-hour depending on the size of the particular plant. Or it sometimes makes good sense to attach a sprinkler to the garden hose and let it stay in position near these plants for an hour or more. With watering restrictions in force in many areas, check the rules before tackling the job.</p>
        <p>Particularly vulnerable are young shrubs that were planted recently. These plants have not had much opportunity to develop the strong root systems that would develop normally in moist soil. Where a water source has been available, however, these young plants have made some progress.</p>
        <p>The same sort of soil moisture logic holds true for perennials. These are also shallow rooted and particularly vulnerable when the soil is dry and hot, especially some of the fancier hybrids. Plants that are native to the region generally fare far better through such crises than the more exotic selections and cultivars.</p>
        <p>Again, deep watering is the solution, if it is allowed under local regulations. In any case, hopefully the old adage of using heavy mulch material has been followed. This sort of organic covering insulates the root systems and helps to preserve what soil moisture there is.</p>
        <p>One definite no-no now is application of fertilizer. Any such application in dry soil, such as this, is quite likely to burn the root systems. Besides woody plants are finished with any growing and are beginning their long settling-down period for the winter months ahead. This natural pattern should not be disturbed with a jarring application of fertilizer.</p>
        <p>As a self-defense mechanism many trees and some shrubs are dropping leaves early, littering sere lawns. Again, this is a natural phenomenon and not necessarily an indication for action on the homeowner's part. Nature's laws are in charge.</p>
        <p>The most hoped-for thing now, of course, would be long steady rainfalls to recharge the reservoirs, fill the aquifers and soak the soil.</p>
        <p>The next best scenario would be a good old-fashioned winter with plenty of snowfall to cover the stressed woody plants and perennials. Snow is nature's blanket. Although heavy snowfall can cause its own sort of problems, including broken branches when it becomes too weighty a load, a good snow cover would protect these stressed plants from the burning winter sun and shelter them from harsh winter winds and extreme cold.</p>
        <p>The snow blanket helps to explain why such delicate wild things survive on the highest alpine slopes to show off their sweet blooms on a summer's day.</p>
        <p>An open winter with little snowfall could spell ruin for plants already stressed by the hot, dry summer. A snowless winter could spell the end of many plants. Some have succumbed already.  GARDENING</p>
