        <p>Bosnian Serb officals said today that an artillery shell fired by a United Nations force killed 10 people and wounded 22 at a hospital in this Serbian-controlled suburb of Sarajevo.</p>
        <p>What appeared to be a hole made by an artillery shell was visible today in the parking area in front of the hospital. Patients inside vividly described an attack, which they said happened Friday.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for the Bosnian Serbs said that although Bosnian Government troops have artillery that can reach the hospital, the shell that hit near the building, as well as several others that fell in the area, came from positions held by the United Nations rapid-reaction force based on Mount Igman.</p>
        <p>In Sarajevo, United Nations officials said that the rapid-reaction force had fired at a target several hundred yards from the hospital after a missile was fired at NATO warplanes. NATO has been carrying out bombing raids in an effort to force the Bosnian Serbs to remove their heavy artillery from around Sarajevo.</p>
        <p>Responding to the Bosnian Serbs' charges, the United Nations command in Zagreb, Croatia, said it would not accept responsibility for shelling the hospital until it was allowed to inspect the site, Reuters reported. The United Nations said that the Bosnian Serbs had blocked United Nations access to the site.</p>
        <p>"While the United Nations finds it impossible to act only on the basis of media reports, if it can be clearly established through a full investigation that the United Nations caused the incident, we will of course be ready to accept the consequences," the United Nations statement said.</p>
        <p>Most of the wounded at the hospital said today that they had come to visit relatives or be treated at the out-patient clinics, and were injured in front of the building. Hospital workers said one patient had been killed and four nurses injured inside the building.</p>
        <p>Bosnian Serb authorities escorted reporters to the hospital and were present while some of the staff were interviewed.</p>
        <p>The medical director said a newborn infant in need of advanced medical care died today after a bridge destroyed by a NATO bomb cut the only road to a larger hospital where the infant was being transferred.</p>
        <p>A thoracic surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Miodran Lazic, said that when the shell hit, people in the hospital froze in shock for a few moments then ran outside to find victims writhing on the ground.</p>
        <p>"Some of them were dead, their bodies torn to pieces, but we took the others inside to do what we could," he said. "We are very short on supplies here."</p>
        <p>A middle-aged woman, her face stitched in several places and her left leg held together by large pins, said she was about to enter the hospital to visit her sister when the shell hit.</p>
        <p>"I was just thrown into the air, and then I saw my leg split open," she said. "I looked at the man next to me and his chest was gushing blood, after that all I remember is people screaming."</p>
        <p>The town of Ilidza, on the west side of Sarajevo, is one of several suburbs controlled by Bosnian Serbs. Many of its inhabitants are Serbian refugees.</p>
        <p>It is from here that machine guns, cannons and mortars have fired on civilian traffic entering Sarajevo on the Mount Igman road, the only route that does not pass through territory held by Bosnian Serb forces.</p>
        <p>United Nations officers say that many of the weapons used to attack the road are hidden in civilian buildings here. Over the last several months, the officers say, they have often refrained from returning fire on the weapons because they could not be sure of avoiding civilian casualties.</p>
        <p>Bosnian Serb military officers said today that there were no military installations near the hospital. The hospital's medical director, Dr. Milan Pejic, said that although there is sometimes outgoing fire in the vicinity of the hospital, there had been none yesterday.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lazic, the thoracic surgeon, blamed the United Nations Rapid Reaction Force for the attack, but said there must have been a mistake.</p>
        <p>"Officers from the French Batallion come here every week to talk to us to see what we need," he said. "At least 90 percent of our equipment was given to us by the French military. They are our friends."</p>
        <p>About 5 A.M. today, a NATO bomb destroyed a bridge on a road linking the Serbian-held area around Sarajevo with the rest of Bosnian Serb territory and Yugoslavia a Bosnian Serb ally. It was over this road that the hospital's medical director said the sick infant was to have traveled to reach better medical care in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>It was not possible to confirm the medical director's report. Hospital workers said the infant's mother was under sedation and couldn't be interviewed.</p>
        <p>But by mid-morning a bypass around the destroyed bridge had been devised and military as well as civilian traffic was moving over the road.</p>
