        <p>The 29 owners voted by 24-5 to approve the agreement. A three-quarters majority, or 22 votes, was needed for approval.

        <p>Russ Granik, the N.B.A.'s deputy commissioner, said he was confident that any challenges to the agreement would be thwarted. A group of 17 players in favor of decertifying the players union might challenge the Sept. 12 election in which players voted to keep their union. And Mitch Richmond of the Sacramento Kings has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the league, charging N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern with coercive tactics.</p>
        <p>"It's our view and our lawyers' view that there's no merit to the Richmond charge or any other challenge," said Granik.  PRO BASKETBALL</p>
