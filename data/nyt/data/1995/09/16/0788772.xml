        <p>In the ever-growing sphere of alternative-rock, bands that copy other bands start to sound original if they copy a lot of bands at the same time. This is what happened on Tuesday night at Brownie's when Rosa Mota, from England, performed.</p>
        <p>One minute it was summoning the spirit of the New York bands the Swans and Lydia Lunch; the next it was in Detroit, blasting away like the Stooges and MC5; then it was echoing its English contemporaries, playing pop songs full of buzzing, droning post-punk guitars, and later its music turned dark and jagged in the style of the Australian group the Birthday Party.</p>

        <p>In the ever-growing sphere of alternative-rock, bands that copy other bands start to sound original if they copy a lot of bands at the same time. This is what happened on Tuesday night at Brownie's when Rosa Mota, from England, performed.</p>
        <p>One minute it was summoning the spirit of the New York bands the Swans and Lydia Lunch; the next it was in Detroit, blasting away like the Stooges and MC5; then it was echoing its English contemporaries, playing pop songs full of buzzing, droning post-punk guitars, and later its music turned dark and jagged in the style of the Australian group the Birthday Party.</p>
        <p>A result was that though the band's music was clearly derivative, it was still hard to pin down.</p>
        <p>The core of Rosa Mota's music was the interplay between the vocalists Ian Bishop and Julie Rumsey, who often sang the same line slightly out of sync and off key, destabilizing the music. Lyrics like "don't confuse me" turned from helpless pleas into deranged threats when the two sang them in their skewed style. The rest of the band's appeal came from its dynamic play. It switched from the sonic wallop of three blaring guitars to whispered lyrics and subdued strings as easily as it switched from the lyric "I love you" to "I wanna kill you."
