        <p>If only it were June or July. Then the Mets would really have something to be excited about. There would be dreams of a pennant race, the playoffs and, heaven forbid, even a World Series.</p>
        <p>But this is September, when the contenders have separated themselves from the pretenders and the Mets are still in last place in the National League East. So they are trying to keep in perspective the excitement generated by a 31-24 record since the All-Star Game break.</p>
        <p>"It's nice to come to the yard knowing you have a chance to win, regardless of what the lineup is, where you're playing and who you're playing," pitcher Bill Pulsipher said. "It's just a shame that we started so late. But this gives us optimism and hope for the future. It's exciting."</p>
        <p>This 13-game road trip from California to Canada was supposed to test the character of the young Mets. Consider the test passed. A 6-2 victory today, generated by the hitting of Carl Everett and the pitching of Jason Isringhausen, was the Mets' third straight over the Expos and seventh of the trip.</p>
        <p>With only Monday night's game at Olympic Stadium remaining before they return to New York, the Mets are assured of a winning record on their journey through Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Montreal, all divisional or wild-card contenders.</p>
        <p>"That's the kind of baseball they're going to have to play if they're ever in a position to win a championship," Mets Manager Dallas Green said. "It's good experience to play teams that are supposed to be grinding it out and trying to win games."</p>
        <p>Second baseman Jeff Kent said: "It shows we can play with these kinds of teams. But it's frustrating, too, because we're battling for last place and beating teams like this."</p>
        <p>After a miserable first half, the under-construction Mets wanted to finish their year with a respectable second half. Performances such as the one they delivered today have helped accomplish that goal.</p>
        <p>Everett struck out in his first and last at-bats, but in between he hit a three-run homer, a double and a single to threaten hitting for the cycle.</p>
        <p>The home run off Expos starter Carlos Perez (10-6) highlighted a five-run third inning that made things easier for Isringhausen, who gave up two runs in the first but threw six scoreless innings after that to improve to 5-2.</p>
        <p>Everett's home run was his 11th of the year and eighth in 42 games since being recalled from Class AAA Norfolk on July 24. He is 6 for 11 and has driven in five runs in the three games against the Expos, and he can be forgiven for thinking about the cycle in his last at-bat.</p>
        <p>"I was thinking about the triple and I swung at three bad pitches," Everett said. "That's why I struck out."</p>
        <p>Still, he produced plenty for Isringhausen, who gave up runs in the first inning for the fifth time in 10 starts but recovered nicely by limiting the Expos to two hits in the third through seventh innings. Isringhausen allowed eight hits and struck out six without yielding a walk. Relievers Jerry DiPoto and Blas Minor took care of the rest.</p>
        <p>"It wasn't a real good Izzy game," Green said. "He didn't have his good stuff, but that's what big league pitching is all about: winning when you don't have your good stuff."</p>
        <p>Kent followed Everett's home run with his 17th home run of the year, the third time this season the Mets have hit back-to-back homers. Damon Buford had a career-high three hits, including a run-scoring single in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Mets (56-68) were positively giddy. There was talk of going 16-4 over their next 20 games to reach .500 for the season. The more attainable goal is to leapfrog the Florida Marlins (56-67) and get out of last place in the division.</p>
        <p>"Nobody remembers where you finished if you don't finish first," Kent said. "But it would be nice not to finish last." INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The Mets' earned run average is 3.99, only the fourth time this season it has been under 4.00. . . . The Mets will be trying for their first four-game sweep of the Expos since 1991. . . . Expos outfielder MOISES ALOU is scheduled to undergo shoulder surgery Tuesday. . . . The Expos have lost 18 of their past 24 home games.  BASEBALL</p>
