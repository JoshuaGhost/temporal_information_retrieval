        <p>An early memory comes from 1968, when my mother sat me in front of the television to watch the incumbent Senator from Oregon, Wayne Morse, debate Bob Packwood. The high point was the moment when Mr. Packwood pulled out a Morse campaign flier, compared it with Senator Morse's statements from his first campaign and showed how his views had been changed by years in Washington.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An early memory comes from 1968, when my mother sat me in front of the television to watch the incumbent Senator from Oregon, Wayne Morse, debate Bob Packwood. The high point was the moment when Mr. Packwood pulled out a Morse campaign flier, compared it with Senator Morse's statements from his first campaign and showed how his views had been changed by years in Washington.</p>
        <p>I remember how impressed I was, even at the age of 10, and I still remember Mr. Packwood's main point: Years in power corrupt you -- you no longer care for your constitutents' interests, only your own.</p>
        <p>A truly sad and cautionary tale for us all is the extent to which Senator Packwood failed to learn his own lesson. BARBARA D. PAXTON  New York, Sept. 8, 1995</p>
