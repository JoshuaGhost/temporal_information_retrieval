        <p>How old is Leon M. Goldstein?</p>
        <p>Asked his age during an interview on Wednesday, Mr. Goldstein, the Mayor's leading choice for the job of schools chancellor, answered: "60."</p>
        <p>"You mean I don't look it?" he quickly added with a laugh.</p>
        <p>He was then asked, twice, for his date of birth.</p>
        <p>"7-17-35," he finally answered.</p>
        <p>But his record at the State Department of Motor Vehicles listed his birthday as July 17, 1932 -- making him 63. Told that in a second interview yesterday, Mr. Goldstein said: "I don't know what happened there."</p>
        <p>He then explained that he had two conflicting "birth records," one that showed him to be 60 and another that showed him to be 63.</p>
        <p>"I was recently told that the one more appropriate to use is 63," he said.</p>
        <p>He said that he did not know the name of the hospital where he was born but that he did know it was in Borough Park, Brooklyn, and that it no longer exists. His parents, Polish immigrants, have since died, he said.</p>
        <p>Trying to find out other basic facts -- such as how long Mr. Goldstein has been married -- was no more straightforward.</p>
        <p>"What is your wife's name?" he was asked on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>"Mary," he responded.</p>
        <p>"And how long have you been married?"</p>
        <p>"Since, let's see, what's 32 years ago?" he responded.</p>
        <p>"So you have been married for 32 years?" he was asked.</p>
        <p>"Yes," he answered.</p>
        <p>Actually, he has been married to Mary Rothlein, the vice president for public affairs at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, only since 1979, 16 years.</p>
        <p>Yesterday Mr. Goldstein clarified his answer and noted that he had been married once before -- to a woman he declined to identify but who is the mother of his two grown children. The marriage ended in divorce. "I said I was married for 32 years," Mr. Goldstein said. "I didn't say I was married to Mary for 32 years."</p>
