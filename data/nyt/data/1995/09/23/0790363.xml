        <p>Knowing how desperate their situation is, the Giants want to make sure they stay together. That is why the team went to a "unification lunch" at an area restaurant today. They were joined by -- guess who? -- Lawrence Taylor.</p>
        <p>The meeting was called by veteran players, and the former Giants linebacker and future Hall of Famer tagged along. This time, Taylor was more low key than he was on Wednesday. Today, he made an appearance at Giants Stadium, staying out of the locker-room area and then leaving to join the Giants at the restaurant. Just about every player attended.</p>

        <p>Knowing how desperate their situation is, the Giants want to make sure they stay together. That is why the team went to a "unification lunch" at an area restaurant today. They were joined by -- guess who? -- Lawrence Taylor.</p>
        <p>The meeting was called by veteran players, and the former Giants linebacker and future Hall of Famer tagged along. This time, Taylor was more low key than he was on Wednesday. Today, he made an appearance at Giants Stadium, staying out of the locker-room area and then leaving to join the Giants at the restaurant. Just about every player attended.</p>
        <p>It was only several days ago that Taylor was present with the team in a players-only meeting. Taylor offered his support, then proceeded to criticize the former Giant linebacker Harry Carson for the critical comments Carson made about the 0-3 team. That same day, Taylor got into a scuffle with a reporter.</p>
        <p>Also today, Carson sent a letter of clarification to each player, saying he did not call the Giants a disgrace to the uniform, as a headline of the story that featured his comments suggested. In the story he did, however, criticize the team's poor play. Strahan's Focus Is on Roaf</p>
        <p>Defensive end Michael Strahan is not having nightmares, but there is no question that over the last several days one man has been constantly on his mind.</p>
        <p>"William Roaf," said Strahan, "is a part of me."</p>
        <p>There will be an interesting battle Sunday at Giants Stadium between Roaf, an offensive tackle for the New Orleans Saints, and Strahan. Some National Football League personnel people and coaches believe that Roaf could develop into one of the best linemen ever.</p>
        <p>Strahan, who had three sacks last week against a good Green Bay offensive line, seems to be developing into a big-time player.</p>
        <p>In only his third season, Roaf last year became only the fourth offensive lineman and first tackle in Saints history to make the Pro Bowl. The 6-foot-5-inch, 300-pound Roaf has amazing quickness for a man his size and power and strength that may be unmatched by any current N.F.L. player.</p>
        <p>And there is one statistic about Roaf that is downright startling: According to the league, Roaf has pass-blocked 1,174 times in his career but has given up just 4 sacks. That means Roaf gives up a sack about every 294 pass attempts. It is believed that no other left tackle in football has better numbers over the span, from 1993 -- when Roaf was a first-round draft pick and started every game as a rookie -- until now.</p>
        <p>Strahan did pretty well against Roaf in a preseason game this year, beating him a couple of times. This time Strahan is looking to do better than just pretty well. Cross's Recognition Blocked</p>
        <p>How much of a warrior is Giants tight end Howard Cross? He has a sore shoulder and an aching knee. But Cross has not missed a practice, and he refuses to miss a game. He is a locker-room leader who is regarded as one of the best blocking tight ends in football.</p>
        <p>He has been invaluable to the organization. Yet outside of New York, Cross is not well-known. It is probably because he does not make that many catches, a la the more well-known tight ends such as Dallas's Jay Novacek (47 receptions last season) or San Francisco's Brent Jones (49). Cross had a career-high 31 receptions last season.</p>
        <p>As solid as Cross is, a good blocking tight end just doesn't get the recognition that a tight end who catches tons of balls gets.  GIANTS NOTEBOOK</p>
