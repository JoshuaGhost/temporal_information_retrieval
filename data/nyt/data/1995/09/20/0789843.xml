        <p>A SIGN of how far chefs have come in creating healthful dishes: For the third annual Evian Healthy Menu Awards, three of the six final recipes were for meat, one of the meats being rabbit, the other two being fowl. In the past, the contest was overwhelmed by fish. Last year, four of the final recipes were for salmon.</p>
        <p>"It got repetitive," said Sara Moulton, the executive chef at Gourmet magazine, which sponsors the awards with Evian. But this year, she found the recipes exciting.</p>

        <p>A SIGN of how far chefs have come in creating healthful dishes: For the third annual Evian Healthy Menu Awards, three of the six final recipes were for meat, one of the meats being rabbit, the other two being fowl. In the past, the contest was overwhelmed by fish. Last year, four of the final recipes were for salmon.</p>
        <p>"It got repetitive," said Sara Moulton, the executive chef at Gourmet magazine, which sponsors the awards with Evian. But this year, she found the recipes exciting.</p>
        <p>"There are more Asian flavors," Ms. Moulton said. "There is more interest in textures. There are spiced crusts and a lot of root vegetables, the use of vegetable juices and vegetable purees."</p>
        <p>And fish, while not gone, is now just one of the ingredients chefs are using. Meats that are low in fat or that can be cooked to reduce the fat -- like duck, rabbit, pheasant and pork -- made appearances, said Ms. Moulton, who tested 125 recipes culled from 200 entries. To qualify for the contest, the recipes could have no more than one tablespoon of added fat per person; salt and sugar could be used in what were referred to as judicious amounts.</p>
        <p>The winning recipe was for duck confit. It's not one that any old-fashioned French cook would recognize, but the duck is still cooked a long time and has a delicious rich flavor.</p>
        <p>"Chefs around the country are cooking this way," Ms. Moulton said. "It is not diet or spa food, but it's healthier food. It's not going to put you over the edge."</p>
        <p>Or as Hubert Des Marais, the executive chef at the Four Seasons Ocean Grand in Palm Beach, Fla., put it: "This cooking is a natural progression. It's instead of going out to an elaborate meal and keeling over the next day."</p>
        <p>The recipes were judged in various areas, with flavor given the most importance, at 25 percent of the grade. The combined category of nutritional value and use of alternatives to traditional ingredients was worth 20 percent, as was creativity. Presentation counted for 10 percent. Use of regional ingredients and ease of preparation were also considered.</p>
        <p>The six dishes in the finals, held last week at the James Beard House on West 12th Street, are often on the menus of the chefs who made them.</p>
        <p>Lou Trope, the head chef of the Maui Marriott Resort in Lahaina, Hawaii, said his entry -- shichimi salmon in rice paper with ginger-infused carrot reduction and cucumber vinaigrette -- was an evolution of Hawaiian cooking.</p>
        <p>"I am not inventing anything new," he said. He introduced the dish on his menu six months ago, and now it is popular. The salmon, in a crust of spices and cooked in rice paper, is crunchy and soft, spicy and sweet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Des Marais's entry -- Wok-Charred Seven-Spice Atlantic Salmon With Oriental Greens, Pickled Beet and Golden Pineapple Essence -- was one of the prettiest dishes in the contest and was created in little more time than it takes to say.</p>
        <p>"I walked around the kitchen and saw what we had and made up the dish in 20 minutes," he said. This was his third time in the contest. "Before, I entered very complex dishes and never hit it," he said. "I was always using bizarre products. So this time I thought, let's make it simple. And I had just gotten a new wok."</p>
        <p>The winner, Kaspar Donier, the head chef of Kaspar's in Seattle, decided on duck, since he always cooks a lot of fish and wanted a challenge.</p>
        <p>"It's something different," he said. "And the French like duck."</p>
        <p>So did the judges.</p>
        <p>"Everyone is watching their weight," he said. "And I should tuck in my tummy while I talk to you. This is not completely spa, but it is healthy, and we sell so many ducks."</p>
        <p>As the winner, Mr. Donier, with his wife, will spend a week at the Royal Club Evian, a spa in southeastern France on Lake Geneva, where he can learn to tuck in his tummy.</p>
        <p>A free booklet with recipes from the contest is available from Evian Healthy Menu Awards, P.O. Box 5128, Bergenfield, N.J. 07621. Skimming Fat (Not Flavor) Asian Duck Confit  Adapted from Kaspar Donier  Total time: 1 hour 40 minutes</p>
        <p>4 cups water  1 cup dry sherry  1/4 cup reduced sodium soy sauce  1/4 cup honey  3 tablespoons oyster sauce  2 tablespoons coarsely chopped ginger  1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil  1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes  1 medium onion, coarsely chopped  3 scallions, thinly sliced  3 cloves garlic, crushed  1 stalk lemon grass  Breasts and legs from 2 ducks,  all visible fat removed.</p>
        <p>1. In a large pot, combine all the ingredients but the duck parts, and bring to a boil, using a cover.</p>
        <p>2. Add the duck legs, return to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, covered, for a half-hour. Add the duck breasts, and continue simmering, covered, for another hour, until all the meat is tender and separates from the bone.</p>
        <p>3. With a slotted spoon, remove the duck from the broth, and transfer to another pan. Strain broth into the pan with the duck.</p>
        <p>4. Puree the vegetables and seasonings remaining after the broth has been strained.</p>
        <p>5. If not using immediately, refrigerate duck in the broth, and refrigerate the puree separately.</p>
        <p>6. Skim any fat that rises to the surface of the broth, and blend 1 cup of the broth with the puree. Remove the duck from the broth, and serve topped with the puree, serving any remaining puree on the side. (Discard the remaining broth.) Serve each person a leg, with the bones, and half of a breast, bones removed. Serve with couscous (recipe below).</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 335 calories, 14 grams fat, 175 milligrams cholesterol, 365 milligrams sodium, 45 grams protein, 6 grams carbohydrate. Shiitake Mushroom Couscous  Adapted from Kaspar Donier  Total time: 20 minutes  1 tablespoon olive oil  1 large leek, trimmed, washed and julienned  10 medium shiitake mushrooms, washed, stemmed and thinly sliced  1 3/4 cups no-salt-added chicken stock  1 cup whole wheat couscous  1/4 teaspoon salt.</p>
        <p>1. Heat the oil in a nonstick saucepan, and saute the leeks until they soften and begin to color.</p>
        <p>2. Add the mushrooms, and continue to cook for about 3 more minutes, until the mushrooms soften and begin to release their liquid.</p>
        <p>3. Add stock, and bring to boil.</p>
        <p>4. Stir in the couscous. Remove from heat, cover and let stand for about 5 minutes, until the liquid has been absorbed and the couscous is tender. Season with salt.</p>
