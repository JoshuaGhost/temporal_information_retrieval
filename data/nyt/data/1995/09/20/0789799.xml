        <p>The Claude Lemieux arbitration hearing is scheduled to resume today at 1:30 P.M, with no decision expected to be announced until later this week. Lemieux, a Devils forward, is disputing the legality of a four-year, $5.2 million contract. Although Lemieux and the Devils agreed to terms last spring, Lemieux contended the deal wasn't binding because the proper documents weren't signed and filed correctly.</p>
        <p>After agreeing to terms, Lemieux won the Conn Smythe trophy as most valuable player in the Stanley Cup playoffs. His market value could be higher now than it was before the playoffs.</p>

        <p>After agreeing to terms, Lemieux won the Conn Smythe trophy as most valuable player in the Stanley Cup playoffs. His market value could be higher now than it was before the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The case is being heard by George Nicolau. Should the decision go in favor of the Devils, Lemieux will be bound to his contract. Should the decision go in favor of Lemieux, there are two possibilities. He could become a Group 2 free agent, and the Devils would have the right to match any salary offered him by another team. Or Lemieux could become a Group 5 free agent, and he would be able to make his own deal without restriction.  HOCKEY</p>
