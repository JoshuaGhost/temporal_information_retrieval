        <p>President Clinton wants to make one thing perfectly clear.</p>
        <p>"Malaise is a state of mind," he said today, touching his finger to his tanned temple. "Funk is something you can bounce out of."</p>
        <p>Worried about the parallels that have been drawn between his promise on Friday night to lead the nation out of its funk and Jimmy Carter's promise to lead America out of malaise, a vow that did much to sour Mr. Carter's re-election campaign, Mr. Clinton took pains today to make sure that his campaign does not get off on a downbeat.</p>
        <p>At a press lunch in the White House, he said he had made a poor choice of words, and stressed, over and over again, that he was "very optimistic" and "feeling good" and that the country was not in a funk.</p>
        <p>"I think if you were betting on which country is likely to be in the strongest shape 20, 30 years from now in the 21st century," he said, "you'd have to bet on the United States because of the strength and diversity of our economy and our society."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton told reporters on Air Force One on Friday night that he was trying to lead people away from their "funk," which he described as anger about government, unease with the pace of technological change and fears for their jobs. To do that, he said, he wanted to talk more, explaining that he had not been talking to voters enough about "the big picture."</p>
        <p>But after two days of unflattering comparisons in television reports with Mr. Carter, another Southern President, Mr. Clinton wanted to refine his comments a bit. He said he had been talking about how Americans felt in 1994, not 1995.</p>
        <p>"I think it would be difficult to convince people that I am advocating a politics of national funk," he said. He warned reporters not to distort his words, while Vice President Al Gore walked behind him, pointed to their notebooks and jokingly spelled: "F-U-N-K."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is clearly into his campaign talking mode. He spent more than an hour at the lunch discoursing on Gen. Colin L. Powell, Speaker Newt Gingrich and President George Bush; his mistakes in office; the things that were perceived as mistakes but that he says were not; the things for which he thinks he does not get enough credit, and his "marketing" strategy for 1996.</p>
        <p>When his spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, tried to get the President to leave right away for a national security meeting on Bosnia, Mr. Clinton testily brushed him off. He said: "That meeting's at 2:15. That's when I called it for."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton stayed so much longer to talk that Mr. McCurry desperately tried again, saying, "Let's go, boss." Mr. Clinton, who had moved on to family values, still ignored him.</p>
        <p>The President made his remarks at a session of that most peculiar Washington institution: a meal, usually breakfast, arranged between newsmakers and journalists by Godfrey Sperling Jr., a columnist for The Christian Science Monitor.</p>
        <p>The White House presented Mr. Sperling, who was celebrating his 80th birthday, with a cake decorated with a replica of one of the high-cholesterol meals served at the breakfasts: coffee, Danish pastries, eggs, bacon and potatoes. Then, as the official White House transcript put it rather drily: "(Happy Birthday is sung to Mr. Sperling.) (Applause.) End. 1:47 P.M. E.D.T."</p>
        <p>Like other Presidential candidates, Mr. Clinton at first tried to ignore the issue of Mr. Powell as a potential challenger for the White House. He refused to answer one question about Mr. Powell's strong popularity and deflected another about whether a black man could win the White House.</p>
        <p>But he eagerly responded to a question about the "defining differences" between himself and Mr. Powell -- by listing all the things on which he and Mr. Powell agree. As he spoke, it was apparent that Mr. Clinton had studied Mr. Powell's public words in great detail.</p>
        <p>"I was grateful for what he said about abortion, that he didn't want to criminalize it but that we should reduce it and emphasize adoption more because that's what I've worked very hard to do," Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>He said, "And I was grateful for what he said about affirmative action." He added, "All I can say to you is that on those statements that he has made, I am profoundly appreciative. I think it's helped America to kind of stay in the sensible center."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton bristled when he was asked about Mr. Gingrich, denouncing the House Speaker's threat to have the Government default on its debts if there is no agreement on other issues like welfare and Medicare. "I'm not going to be blackmailed," he said.</p>
        <p>But, for the most part, as he tries to make headway against the Republican domination of Washington, Mr. Clinton was eager to keep the tone positive. He took credit for the new Palestinian-Israeli agreement and progress in Bosnia as "examples of the imperative for United States leadership."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton said he was determined not to repeat the mistakes of Mr. Bush, on which Mr. Clinton, as a candidate, had pounced so eagerly in 1992. "George Bush never got anyone to associate him with any achievement besides Desert Storm," Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>So at the first invitation, he rattled off what he considers his accomplishments. "The economy is in better shape," he said. "We passed the toughest crime bill in American history, and it's plainly playing a role in driving the crime rate down throughout the country. When there was no action on welfare reform, we gave two-thirds of the states, I think more than two-thirds now, the right to pursue their own reforms. And we have lowered the cost and increased the availability of a college education."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton took exception to the suggestion that he needed to produce fresh ideas to compete with the Republicans in Congress. Echoing the convictions of other incumbent Presidents in trouble, including Mr. Bush, he said he had to do a better job of getting his words across.</p>
        <p>"I may have a marketing problem," he said. "I do not have a substantive problem." If George Bush had made smarter choices about buying 30-second spots in 1992, he could have received credit for the Clean Air Act and other achievements, Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>The President said he had made mistakes in his first years in office, including "making a lot of people mad" at first. But he insisted that the issue he had made one of his first priorities in office -- allowing gay men and women to serve openly in the military -- had been forced on him by the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who has often seemed to enjoy campaigning more than the gritty reality of governing, spoke openly of his eagerness to return to the stump. He even noted with relish that he had lost weight.</p>
        <p>"Ten more pounds to go," he said.</p>
