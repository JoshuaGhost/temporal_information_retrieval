        <p>Usually when a musician gets a standing ovation, it is given at the end of a concert in hopes of an encore. But on Saturday night at the Beacon, John Prine received four standing ovations in the middle of his concert. This is because Mr. Prine, who has been building music from folk, country, the 6 o'clock news and his own idiosyncratic world view for 25 years, has a way with words that's hard to resist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prine's songs are filled with hard-won profundities, some delivered as solemnly as a eulogy, others as offhand as a party joke. He has a rapper's ability to make almost anything rhyme, and, as a veteran of both the Army and the Postal Service, a fatalism that never takes itself seriously.</p>

        <p>Usually when a musician gets a standing ovation, it is given at the end of a concert in hopes of an encore. But on Saturday night at the Beacon, John Prine received four standing ovations in the middle of his concert. This is because Mr. Prine, who has been building music from folk, country, the 6 o'clock news and his own idiosyncratic world view for 25 years, has a way with words that's hard to resist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prine's songs are filled with hard-won profundities, some delivered as solemnly as a eulogy, others as offhand as a party joke. He has a rapper's ability to make almost anything rhyme, and, as a veteran of both the Army and the Postal Service, a fatalism that never takes itself seriously.</p>
        <p>In his breakup song, "All the Best," he sang:</p>
        <p>Say you drive a Chevy, say you drive a Ford</p>
        <p>You say you drive around the town till you just get bored</p>
        <p>And then you change your mind for something else to do</p>
        <p>And your heart gets bored with your mind and it changes you.</p>
        <p>The audience members at the Beacon put such an emphasis on Mr. Prine's lyrics that they didn't clap with recognition when he started strumming a song. It wasn't until Mr. Prine sang the first line of popular numbers like "Please Don't Bury Me" -- "Woke up this morning, put on my slippers, walked in the kitchen and died" -- that he was rewarded with the applause of familiarity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Prine sings in a raspy, working man's voice that usually sounds as if it is on the brink of laughter. At the Beacon he backed his folksy guitar picking and strumming with a versatile five-person band. Performing songs on Mr. Prine's most recent album, "Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings" (Oh Boy), they brought the references to "Johnny B. Goode" in "Leave the Lights On" to the surface and turned "Quit Hollerin' at Me" into a shimmering psychedelic jam.</p>
        <p>When the backup band left the stage in the middle of the concert, it was Mr. Prine's turn to be playful. In "It's a Big Old Goofy World," he sang:</p>
        <p>Up in the morning, work like a dog</p>
        <p>Is better than sitting like a bump on a log.</p>
        <p>Then he stopped and, with a self-deprecating smile, commented, "Sounds like an Alpo commercial," as if he was just then realizing how dangerously close parody can come to the real thing.</p>
        <p>The concert began with a set by Junior Brown, a musician who has been working since the 60's and, like Mr. Prine, is only just now beginning to get the recognition he deserves. Mr. Brown played his self-styled guit-steel, a combination standard and steel guitar, and sang tales of hard breakups and fast living like "My Wife Thinks Your Dead" in a honky-tonk baritone similar to Ernest Tubb's. Mr. Brown ended his performance of guitar gymnastics with a medley that harked back to the time when contemporary instrumental music meant Dick Dale and the Ventures instead of Yanni and George Winston.
