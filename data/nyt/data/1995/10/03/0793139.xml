        <p>The Dixie Hummingbirds, one of gospel music's most venerable quartets, were preceded on Sunday night at Symphony Space by an opening act that was difficult  to follow. It was a documentary film about the group, which has been using the Lord's name in song since 1928, well before gospel helped bring about secular styles like rhythm-and-blues, doo-wop and soul. Directed by Ashley James and titled "We Love You Like a Rock," after the hit song the group sang with Paul Simon in 1973 ("Love Me Like a Rock"), the film showed the group backstage, onstage and at home.</p>
        <p>After the movie, when it came time for the Dixie Hummingbirds to perform in the flesh, the audience had just heard the group's best-known songs, seen excerpts of some of its most gripping performances, witnessed the vocal prowess  of legendary ex-Hummingbirds like the bass William Bobo, and familiarized itself with the group's stock stage moves and audience-engaging techniques. What could  the Dixie Hummingbirds do to top themselves?</p>

        <p>The Dixie Hummingbirds, one of gospel music's most venerable quartets, were preceded on Sunday night at Symphony Space by an opening act that was difficult  to follow. It was a documentary film about the group, which has been using the Lord's name in song since 1928, well before gospel helped bring about secular styles like rhythm-and-blues, doo-wop and soul. Directed by Ashley James and titled "We Love You Like a Rock," after the hit song the group sang with Paul Simon in 1973 ("Love Me Like a Rock"), the film showed the group backstage, onstage and at home.</p>
        <p>After the movie, when it came time for the Dixie Hummingbirds to perform in the flesh, the audience had just heard the group's best-known songs, seen excerpts of some of its most gripping performances, witnessed the vocal prowess  of legendary ex-Hummingbirds like the bass William Bobo, and familiarized itself with the group's stock stage moves and audience-engaging techniques. What could  the Dixie Hummingbirds do to top themselves?</p>
        <p>The live performance, presented by the World Music Institute and City Lore,  started tentatively, with the quartet dressed in matching white suits and singing its traditional concert opener, "Who Are We?" The number didn't have the energy, charm or improvisation of its performance in the movie, and lines like "We love to sing" sounded rote. But midway through the concert, as the group's senior member Ira Tucker sang, in his rough, expressive voice, "When it's all over, when I can't sing no more/I just want you to meet me on the other shore,"  the group started to relax and get playful with its harmonies, exhortations and  phrasings. Within minutes, the audience was on its feet, raising its arms in the air to let the Lord's spirit enter them.</p>
        <p>Though they have had 16 personnel changes, the Dixie Hummingbirds haven't lost touch with their roots. They've absorbed most of the changes church music underwent in the first half of the century, and it showed in their hard-gospel songs, filled with jubilee-style harmonies and backed very subtly by jazz and rhythm-and-blues drums and guitar. Mr. Tucker was an expressive and diverse singer, able to swoop from a crystalline falsetto to a growling bass. But it was the three-part harmonies and vocal flourishes of the rest of the group that made the Hummingbirds shine, particularly the sweet tenor of Paul Owens, who led "This World Is a Dressing Room," and the octave-jumping melismas of their newest member, Carl Davis, who replaced the bass James Walker after his death two years ago.</p>
        <p>"They stand for something," Bobby Womack said of the Hummingbirds in the documentary. Though he didn't specify what that "something" was, by the end of Sunday's performance, it was clear. They stand for old-time religion and old-time entertainment, and the belief that old times are good times and that good times are never out of reach. In other words, hope.</p>
