        <p>Investigators said today that they had found evidence of three separate safety violations in the wreckage of a small plane that crashed while carrying parachutists in eastern Virginia last month, a finding that raises questions about the adequacy of the inspections for such planes.</p>
        <p>But the chief investigator on the case for the National Transportation Safety Board, Charles F. Leonard, said that it was too early to say if any of the violations had caused the crash or even contributed to it.</p>
        <p>The accident, which occurred on Sept. 10 in Shacklefords, Va., 43 miles east of Richmond, killed 10 parachutists and the pilot as well as one man on the ground.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leonard, said that the plane, a Beechcraft Queenair 65, had been 11 to 150 pounds over its maximum takeoff weight of 7,700 pounds. It had also been loaded wrong, putting its center of gravity too far to the rear and reducing stability, and the cabin door had been removed, which could have created turbulence, he said.</p>
        <p>Last year, the safety board recommended to the Federal Aviation Administration that the surveillance of sport-parachute planes be increased. Indeed, the F.A.A. agreed and instructed its district offices to submit plans for the 1995 fiscal year, which ended on Sunday, for increasing the supervision  of the planes.</p>
        <p>But the planes are still generally inspected on an "as needed" basis and can  go years between inspections, Mr. Leonard said.</p>
        <p>The United States Parachute Association said that from 1992 to 1994, 37 people had been killed in plane crashes involving sky diving while 98 parachutists had died in jumps.</p>
        <p>The safety board said that in last month's crash, the plane's door had been improperly removed and that paper work had been altered to make it look as if the modification had been approved.</p>
        <p>The sequence of events that ended in the crash may have begun with one engine failing. At the time of the crash, witnesses reported an engine sputtering. But  investigators say one engine had apparently been shut down before impact, which  may indicate that the pilot was trying to re-start it. A fire after the crash destroyed much of the other engine, so investigators do not know if it was running at the time of the crash.</p>
