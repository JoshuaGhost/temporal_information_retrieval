        <p>When Pope John Paul II arrives for his latest American visit, he will find a church in the middle of historic demographic change.</p>
        <p>The American Catholic Church has absorbed floods of immigrants -- Irish, Italians, Mexicans and Eastern Europeans of many nationalities. But never before have the newly arriving been so diverse: from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.</p>
        <p>In the New York Archdiocese, Mass can heard in 38 languages; the two most recently created parishes are Our Lady of Shkodra, serving Albanians in Hartsdale, N.Y., and St. John Nam, serving Koreans in the Bronx. In the Newark Archdiocese, while visiting parishes in Elizabeth, N.J., one recent Sunday, Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick said he "began the day in Portuguese" and then heard Masses in Slovak and Polish; on another day, the languages might have been Vietnamese and French Creole.</p>
        <p>But the Pope will also find that immigrants and immigration have become a sharply divisive issue, putting his bishops increasingly at odds with the nation's political leaders, and with much of the public, both Catholics and non-Catholics.</p>
        <p>This past spring, Archbishop McCarrick twice criticized Clinton Administration officials for plans to return refugees to Cuba and Haiti from the American naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
        <p>And last fall, Roger Cardinal Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles, went up against Gov. Pete Wilson of California, denouncing as a "social sin" a ballot measure Mr. Wilson supported that would deny medical and educational services to illegal aliens. In the end, voters passed the measure.</p>
        <p>In metropolitan New York, where the Pope will spend most of his visit, 42 percent of Catholic residents say that either they or one or both of their parents were born outside the United States, according to The New York Times/CBS News Poll. By contrast, only 27 percent of Catholics outside the metropolitan area say that they or a parent were born outside this country.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, a majority of the American public -- and a majority of Catholics, both inside and outside the New York metropolitan area -- favors a position closer to Congress's than to the bishops, according to the New York Times/CBS News poll. The poll, a nationwide telephone survey of 1,536 adults, found that only 30 percent of Americans want immigration kept at its present level, while 54 percent want it reduced. Among the 423 Catholics included in the poll, the results are statistically indistinguishable from the country as a whole.</p>
        <p>The poll, taken between Sept. 18 to 22, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. It was conducted in English and Spanish, and may have excluded people who do not speak those languages.</p>
        <p>In opposing rising anti-immigrant sentiments, the bishops are being "very countercultural," said John Swenson, director of the Office of Migration and Refugee Services for the United States Catholic Conference, which represents the bishops' social policy concerns. During the summer, Mr. Swenson said, he testified before a Congressional subcommittee on immigration that the bishops strongly opposed a proposal to cut back the number of legal immigrants allowed into the United States.</p>
        <p>Archbishop McCarrick has formed a committee on migration that has made its feelings clear. It chose Independence Day to issue a pastoral letter, "One Family Under God," which declared that Catholic social teaching demanded that immigrants be treated with hospitality, not hostility. Scripture is full of stories of migrants seeking help and refuge, the committee said, citing the flight of Mary and Joseph, with the infant Jesus, to Egypt.</p>
        <p>"We wanted to issue it on July 4," said Archbishop McCarrick, one of the document's authors and also chairman of the bishops' migration committee, "because we're concerned that the nation may be moving away from what made it very much the beacon."</p>
        <p>Archbishop McCarrick said church officials have briefed the Vatican on the immigration controversy, and also provided information about the ethnic makeup of the dioceses the Pontiff will visit. "I know the Holy Father is aware of the xenophobia that not only affects our country, but affects the whole Western world," the Archbishop said.</p>
        <p>The Pope's own feelings on the issue are no mystery. Less than a month ago, he released a statement in Rome asking understanding of the circumstances in which many illegal immigrants find themselves. To developed nations vexed by the problem of porous borders, he urged international cooperation to foster political stability and economic development, so that people will not be forced to flee civil strife or economic distress.</p>
        <p>And speaking directly to Catholics, the Pope counseled compassion. "Today the illegal migrant comes before us like that 'stranger' in whom Jesus asks to be recognized," the pontiff wrote, citing Matthew 25:35. "To welcome him and to show him solidarity is a duty of hospitality and fidelity to Christian identity itself."</p>
        <p>It is a message echoed by officials who keep track of immigrant groups in the church at the United States. Catholic Conference's offices in Washington. "We don't want to ignore national borders, or disrespect them," said Sister Suzanne Hall, director of the Office of Pastoral Care of Migrants and Refugees. "But the primary consideration is that we are sisters and brothers."</p>
        <p>Looking over a list of Asian Catholics, Sister Suzanne estimated that the church in this country is spiritual home to 1.3 million Filipinos, 200,000 Vietnamese, 80,000 Koreans, perhaps as many as 70,000 Chinese and smaller numbers of Cambodians, Laotians and Hmong. Many of the larger groups arrived with their own priests and nuns, and some have ordained priests from within their communities here.</p>
        <p>More recent Catholic immigrants come from Eritrea and Ethiopia in East Africa, and Nigeria, Ghana and Liberia in West Africa, Sister Suzanne said.</p>
        <p>And just in the last year, she added, her office has made contact with new communities of Mayan Indians from Guatemala, who have recently settled in Florida and Arizona. They speak their own languages, rather than Spanish, meaning that priests who know Quiche and Mam must be brought up on visits from Central America to serve their spiritual needs. "We have Masses for them when we can," she said.</p>
        <p>Yet such immigrant groups are small when compared with those Catholics who have arrived from Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America. The latter are well known to Ron Cruz, executive director of the Catholic Conference's Secretariat of Hispanic Affairs. He estimated they number 22 million, slightly more than a third of the American church's total population. About one-fourth were born outside the United States.</p>
        <p>Hispanic Catholics defy the geographical stereotypes of men and women who settle within a few hundred miles of the Mexican border or in the neighborhoods of a few of the nation's biggest cities, he said.</p>
        <p>"They're virtually all over the country," Mr. Cruz said. "I just came from Portland, Ore., where they have an incredible Hispanic population."</p>
        <p>And two years ago, at a workshop for Hispanic Catholics he arranged in Newark, Mr. Cruz said he was "amazed at the number of doctors," men who had immigrated in hope of finding medical work in America.</p>
        <p>"It's a whole gamut," he added. "Yes, you have lots of poor, but you also have increasing numbers of professionals."  A VISIT FROM THE POPE: NEW COMMUNITIES</p>
