        <p>A man from the Bronx was convicted of manslaughter yesterday in the 1991 shooting of a Lehman College student from a moving subway train, the Bronx District Attorney, Robert Johnson, said.</p>
        <p>A Bronx jury found the man, Lawrence Sinclair, 21, guilty of one count of manslaughter for the death of the student, Paula Soto, 19, on March 19, 1991, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Soto, of Riverdale, was on an athletic field at Lehman College warming up for a softball game when she was struck by shots fired from an elevated subway train a block away. She died a few hours later while undergoing surgery.</p>
        <p>An anonymous tip led to Mr. Sinclair's arrest on Aug. 12, 1993. According to  testimony, Mr. Sinclair was asked during a job interview whether he had ever shot anyone, and he admitted that he had fired shots while standing between two  cars of a moving train, hitting a woman who later died. He was placed under police surveillance and later arrested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sinclair faces a maximum prison term of 5 to 15 years when Justice Martin Marcus of State Supreme Court sentences him Nov. 17.</p>
