        <p>The abduction and rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa, allegedly by three American servicemen, has stoked opposition to the presence of the 47,000 American troops stationed throughout Japan. The Clinton Administration has made an excellent start in assuring the Japanese that justice will be served, but more steps are needed to insure that the furor over this one ugly episode does not jeopardize the American security relationship with Japan. President Clinton should find time on his trip to Japan next month to demonstrate sensitivity to local concerns and reiterate the rationale for keeping American forces based there.</p>
        <p>Despite the end of the cold war, American troops are needed in Japan. North Korea remains one of the world's gravest security threats, and American forces assure others in Asia and many Japanese themselves that the Tokyo Government will not feel the need to rearm. Japan helps pay for the troop presence with $5 billion a year in subsidies. But the people of Okinawa, where most American troops in Japan are stationed, had grown uneasy well before the latest episode. They voted repeatedly in recent years for a Governor who promised to evict the Americans.</p>

        <p>The abduction and rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl in Okinawa, allegedly by three American servicemen, has stoked opposition to the presence of the 47,000 American troops stationed throughout Japan. The Clinton Administration has made an excellent start in assuring the Japanese that justice will be served, but more steps are needed to insure that the furor over this one ugly episode does not jeopardize the American security relationship with Japan. President Clinton should find time on his trip to Japan next month to demonstrate sensitivity to local concerns and reiterate the rationale for keeping American forces based there.</p>
        <p>Despite the end of the cold war, American troops are needed in Japan. North Korea remains one of the world's gravest security threats, and American forces assure others in Asia and many Japanese themselves that the Tokyo Government will not feel the need to rearm. Japan helps pay for the troop presence with $5 billion a year in subsidies. But the people of Okinawa, where most American troops in Japan are stationed, had grown uneasy well before the latest episode. They voted repeatedly in recent years for a Governor who promised to evict the Americans.</p>
        <p>Many Okinawans, as well as other Japanese, were disturbed that the American servicemen accused of the rape were initially kept in United States custody during the investigation, pending formal charges. The Pentagon follows a similar system in most countries where American forces are stationed, and the United States has an obligation to protect the rights of accused Americans in countries where civil liberties may not be adequately protected. In the case of Japan, however, the Administration was right to agree recently to hand over the three men rather than waiting until they are formally charged.</p>
        <p>The United States need not apply this standard everywhere. South Korea is pressing to take custody of rape and murder suspects before they are charged. Before the United States agrees, it must be satisfied that South Korea no longer condones the brutal interrogation of suspects. Even many NATO countries allow the United States to maintain custody of accused military personnel until conviction.</p>
        <p>Other steps can be taken to assuage the Okinawans and Japanese. Washington should consider consolidating American forces, perhaps easing the concentration on Okinawa. There might be ways to give Okinawa control over the Naha port and local airports.</p>
        <p>American military behavior in Japan has generally been good since the occupation in 1945. It would be a mistake to let instances of criminal behavior undercut the common Japanese and American objectives of preserving the peace in East Asia.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 31, 1995, Tuesday</p>
        <p>An editorial on Saturday, headlined "Questions of Justice in Okinawa," misstated recent charges against three American servicemen in Okinawa in some editions. The servicemen have been charged with the abduction and rape of a 12-year-old schoolgirl, not with rape and murder.</p>
