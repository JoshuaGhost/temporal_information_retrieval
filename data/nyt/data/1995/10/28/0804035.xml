        <p>Senator Strom Thurmond glided slowly from the Senate debating chamber into the shadows of reception room S213, blinking and reflexively drawling, "How ya doin'?" to no one in particular as he moved among the lobbyists swarming like groupies at a stage door.</p>
        <p>Scores of lobbyists were in motion below the naive smiles of the cherubim painted on the Capitol ceiling. Armed with propaganda handouts and cellular phones, the lobbyists were in their special pen indulging in the precious constitutional right to petition the Government, darting pinball-fast around passing lawmakers.</p>
        <p>The heavy, industry lobbyists have already done their work with PAC money and private dinners," said Anna Aurilio, a fleetly moving environmental lobbyist. She talked while scooting after senators today as a crucial vote loomed to block the Republican leadership's plan to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drillers.</p>
        <p>"The oil lobbyists had a private reception this morning in a Senate side room -- they kicked me out -- and they're back downtown in their offices now watching the results of their work on C-Span," said Ms. Aurilio, a lobbyist for the United States Public Interest Research Group, who suddenly spotted Senator Sam Nunn passing through.</p>
        <p>"You've got my vote and you didn't promise me anything," Senator Nunn said, smiling at Ms. Aurilio as he underlined the fact that lobbyists' campaign contributions are too often synonymous with Capitol access and law-drafting powers.</p>
        <p>"Lobbying is a part of our system where people bring you information," said the Mr. Nunn, who is preparing to quit the Senate after 24 years of being plied  by lobbyists.</p>
        <p>"What needs to be separated from lobbying is the political fund-raising process. If I had my way, we'd have a ban on raising money within a 50-mile radius of Washington," said the Senator, deep into fantasy as he picked his way  through the importuning crowd.</p>
        <p>The scene had the excitement of a day at the races, along the rail. The oil-drilling issue and a dozen other assorted attempts at amendment were voted on before the final Senate vote on the huge budget reconciliation bill. These votes were preliminary sprints. The lobbyists offered the sort of touts' buzz and mutterings at fortune to be heard near parimutuel windows.</p>
        <p>Lobbyists for the American Medical Association waited quietly off to one side, having a winning-ticket day as the Republican leadership's special Medicare concessions to the doctors stayed firmly in the bill. The environmentalists moved far less assuredly. They scurried past portraits of Clay and Webster, Taft and LaFollette that presented a crossfire of fixed stares over democracy's climactic bit of free-for-all.</p>
        <p>"You've got to hand it to the Alaska delegation," said Sylvia Ward, director  of the Northern Alaska Environmental Center, conceding that the state's Republican lawmakers had prepared well in defending their move to open the 19-million-acre Arctic refuge to drilling. "They're very much in power," she said, describing the environmentalist strategy of winning at least enough votes  to bolster President Clinton's vow to use a veto to protect the refuge.</p>
        <p>As the amendment to block the drilling came up, Ms. Aurilio and her lobbyist  colleagues worked in waves, trying to corner undecided senators with a new study of campaign donation records showing that the biggest Senate recipients of oil industry PAC money are also the strongest supporters of opening the refuge to the oil industry.</p>
        <p>"We don't go check-in-hand to these decision makers," explained Evan Hirsche, a lobbyist with the National Audubon Society. "We go with accurate information," he said, referring to grass-roots pressure mounted in home districts with detailed tales of the oil industry's $17 million in political contributions to selected senators in the past 6 years.</p>
        <p>Gavel-quick, word came forth from just inside the chamber on the fate of the  anti-drilling amendment.</p>
        <p>"We lost 51 to 48," said Ms. Aurilio with unexpected cheer. "But we picked up four new votes over the last time," she beamed. She noted that Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader and Presidential contender who supports the drilling, would know well that the Republicans lacked the override votes needed in any showdown test of the President's promised veto.</p>
        <p>Cheer crept in as the lobbyists grouped under one of the chandeliers in reception room S213 and moved down the voting tally with the practiced eye of handicappers.</p>
        <p>"Specter," said Mr. Hirsche in sudden delight, as if at a dark-horse showing  near the wire. "Arlen Specter came over to us," he exulted of the Pennsylvania Republican who has done well enough in oil industry contributions, but needs to  do better in his campaign as a moderate Republican candidate for President.</p>
        <p>The day's environmental lobbying was over. Another special-interest group moved to the fore as post time approached for the next amendment.</p>
        <p>"They can taste it now," said Mr. Hirsche, cautioning his colleagues about the skills of their rival lobbyists from the oil industry. "They're going to be  working these guys even harder," he said, moving to the exit as the cherubim maintained their gaze upon S213.</p>
