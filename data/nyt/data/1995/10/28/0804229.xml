        <p>In the early 1960's, SAM PERRY was a champion sprinter at Passaic High School in New Jersey. In 1965, running for Fordham, he twice equaled the world indoor record of 5.9 seconds for the 60-yard dash. He became a lawyer, the first black elected to the Passaic City Council and a member of the William Paterson College board of trustees. He is now vice president and general counsel of the American Kennel Club. Today, before a Homecoming Day football game against Bloomfield, his old high school will dedicate its new all-weather track at Boverini Stadium in his name.</p>
