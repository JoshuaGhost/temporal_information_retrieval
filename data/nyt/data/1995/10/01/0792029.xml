        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is a pity that Albert Camus's rehabilitation from the effects of an old political correctness should be pursued in complicity with a new one. In his review of "The First Man" (Aug. 27), Victor Brombert duly appeals to current shibboleths: Camus "opposed extremism and violence on both sides" and "favored a multicultural Algeria."</p>
        <p>But it must be said that this "multicultural" vision presupposed French rule over Algeria. "I believe in justice," Camus said, "but I shall defend my mother  above justice." This meant seeking solutions well short of majority rule and self-determination for Algerian Muslims, including bizarre schemes evocative of  later Afrikaner designs to retain power in South Africa. Certainly we must appreciate why this Algerian Frenchman who truly sympathized with Algerian Muslims stopped short of accepting their right to self-determination; the fact remains that he had effective citizenship in two countries, Algeria and France,  while they had none at all. Today there is little point in blaming Camus for not envisioning a form of majority rule that would have genuinely protected the cultural and political rights of minorities, but even less in celebrating a "multiculturalism" based on minority rule.</p>
        <p>Rather than providing new ammunition for fighting such old battles, the long-delayed publication of Camus's unfinished last novel should provoke a rethinking of the intellectual climate of the cold war. Rather than simply turning the tables, we might ask why various people acted as they did, noting both their strengths and their weaknesses.</p>
