        <p>The Jefferson Market Courthouse, with its fantastical Victorian Gothic clock  tower, is one of Greenwich Village's most prominent visual landmarks. Now, a group of residents are determined to make it an audible landmark as well. Old Jeff, as the 12,500-pound bell behind the clock face is called, served as a fire alarm until the 1870's. Since then, it has hung silent in the tower of the building, now a New York Public Library branch. The group, led by the preservationist Margot Gayle, expects to raise $10,000 for an electric mechanism to strike the bronze bell hourly. It is seeking a public hearing to determine whether the bell should sound round the clock or fall silent late at night. The  prospect of neighborhood pealing reminds Norma Leavey, president of the West 10th Street Block Association, of when she lived in Europe. "Except for Sundays, you just don't hear bells in New York," she said. "I could use a reminder of the time since I don't wear a watch."</p>
        <p>But some people who live near the building are not as thrilled. Joel Selonick bought his apartment for its astounding view of the eight-story clock tower. "I  love that building," he said, "but I think I'm going to hate that bell."</p>
