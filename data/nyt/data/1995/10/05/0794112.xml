        <p>THE handmade pillows on Barbara Pershyn-Davis's bed in Basking Ridge, N.J., are a little firmer than most. They smell sweet, too, and they should: they're stuffed with straw. "It doesn't get saggy like down," said Ms. Pershyn-Davis, a young antiques dealer and decorator, whose idea was inspired by the organic innards of a 1700's Swedish chair she bought.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pershyn-Davis hand-sews similar pillows, cushions, bolsters and mattresses for clients, too, using antique fabrics. To clean, remove the straw, dry-clean the fabric and restuff. "After six months, put in more straw, because it compacts," she said. Prices are from $45 for a 14-by-20-inch pillow to $250 for a daybed-size mattress. Fabrics are $65 a yard. Surplus straw is also available. Garden Atelier, (908) 766-0680.  CURRENT</p>
