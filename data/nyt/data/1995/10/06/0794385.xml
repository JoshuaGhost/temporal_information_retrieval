        <p>Gilbert Associates Inc. of Reading, Pa., said yesterday that it had agreed to buy all of the XEL Corporation's common stock for $30 million in cash. Gilbert,  which owns the GAI-Tronics Corporation, a supplier of industrial communications  equipment, would pay XEL shareholders more if XEL, which makes computer network  products, meets earnings targets in the fourth quarters of 1996, 1997 and 1998,  and meets revenue targets from 1996 until 1998. Gilbert Associates said it would use the proceeds from its recent sale of its Gilbert/Commonwealth unit to  the Parsons Corporation for the purchase of XEL, a closely held company based in Aurora, Colo.</p>
