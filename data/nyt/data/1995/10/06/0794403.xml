        <p>STEVE THOMAS practiced with the Devils for the first time yesterday before taking his physical and will play against Florida in the season opener tomorrow  at Byrne Meadowlands Arena. Thomas is expected to play on a line with NEAL BROTEN as his center and JOHN MacLEAN the right wing. Coach JACQUES LEMAIRE said after yesterday's practice that BOBBY CARPENTER's cut by a skate behind his right leg that required seven stitches would keep him out of the season opener.  JIMMY DOWD will take his place on the team's top checking line. MARTIN BRODEUR,  who joined the team last weekend after signing his contract, said after practice it was very unlikely he would play tomorrow. Defenseman KEVIN DEAN, who was sent to the minor leagues last week, is back with the Devils. Dean is on the team's protected list and cannot be sent to the minors unless he clears waivers.</p>
