        <p>AFTER A BIBULOUS DINNER IN Fiesole, Gianni Pettena, an architect, historian and teacher who lives outside Florence, offered to drive my friend and me back to our hotel. "But first," Pettena said, "there's something special I want to show you. The power plant at the Florence train station. Do you know it? No? Strange, but no one knows it. And it's remarkable -- the only Futurist building  ever built."</p>
        <p>We sped down from the hills, fearing collision at every hairpin turn, which is actually the best way to approach a Futurist building. At least in its rhetoric, the Futurist movement was eager to court death in the pursuit of machine-made speed. The movement's ringleader, the poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, had said that a car going at full throttle was more beautiful than the "Winged Victory of Samothrace." And this was before seat belts.</p>
        <p>Have a glass or two of wine before you go to see this building. The plant, of russet-colored concrete and brick, is not in the best condition; there are broken windows, and the building looks better through a haze. It's also helpful  to be in a frame of mind susceptible to ecstasy. The Futurists preached the ecstasy of movement, the exhilaration of speed, ideas not easily conveyed by a building planted firmly on the ground.</p>
        <p>Designed by Angiolo Mazzoni, the power plant was built in 1932, long after Futurism had collapsed. Antonio Sant'Elia, the most prominent architect in a movement that embraced painting, sculpture, music and, above all, the modern art of media manipulation, died in 1916, without having built any of his visionary projects. By the 1930's, Italy's most progressive architects had embraced Rationalism, the Italian version of the International Style. But Mazzoni had originally been allied with Sant'Elia; in 1914 he signed Sant'Elia's manifesto for Futurist architecture. His design for the Florence power plant is thus a throwback, an oddly successful blend of Futurist, Rationalist and Art Deco motifs.</p>
        <p>Mazzoni, a director of special projects for Italy's state railway system, was known primarily for Rationalist buildings, including many train stations. As Richard Etlin writes in his superb "Modernism in Italian Architecture, 1890-1940," Mussolini set great store in the design of stations because they were the buildings most seen by foreign tourists: you saw them close-up from the trains that Il Duce made run on time.</p>
        <p>The Futurist vision of architecture was not, primarily, one of stand-alone buildings. It was an urban vision. Sant'Elia's drawings for la Citta Nuova (the  New City) in 1914 envisioned a city in which transportation -- elevators, bridges, roadways -- provided the key architectural elements. Infrastructure became metastructure. Mazzoni's power plant derives much of its impact from the  rail viaduct to which it is attached and from its placement just beyond a bend in the tracks. As you look down the street toward the plant, the bend creates the illusion that the building's power has warped the space around it.</p>
        <p>The plant's most explicitly Futurist element is the steel superstructure, a colonnade of four chimneys, connected by a catwalk overhead and an open stair to one side. You can see how classical Futurism could be: it's an industrial Parthenon atop its own brick pediment, with belching steam for a frieze. Pettena said the building was much more impressive before the power system was converted to gas. It used to run on coal, which was brought in on trains, then hoisted into the building by crane. At night you could see the coal fires glowing, an infernal spectacle of power, steam and speed.</p>
        <p>It's a dubious distinction to be the only Futurist building, since this was not the most attractive ideology ever associated with an art movement. It celebrated not only speed but violence. Marinetti declared war "the world's own  hygiene." He was an early supporter of Mussolini. And he mounted a wicked campaign against pasta.</p>
        <p>SANT'ELIA, A CASUALTY OF that act of global hygiene called World War I, can't be tarred with the Fascist brush; he was dead long before Mussolini marched on Rome. And there's some question as to whether Sant'Elia actually shared the Futurist agenda. Etlin suggests that Sant'Elia might have signed on with the Futurists mainly for the purpose of personal promotion. Even so, one can be appalled by the glorification of phallic energy in Sant'Elia's ideas and  in Mazzoni's realization of them.</p>
        <p>Looking up at the power plant now, with its row of chimneys that no longer belch smoke, you see, first of all, a proud proclamation of faith in the power of industrial technology. Look again and it's the faith, not the technology, that sticks out, the sense of entitlement implicit in the word Futurism.  The difference is critical. It's the second look that reveals why this building speaks to the present: the plant's confidence, its certainty, its resemblance to a religious edifice have no parallel today.</p>
        <p>There's no shortage of architects vending certainties now -- classical revivalists, new urbanists, advocates of the new simplicity, deconstructionists. Each of these factions (and others) can articulate its position with apparent poise. I've followed debates among them, and each time I have come away with the feeling that I was seeing a sideshow. No faction has captured the moment as well as our not having to choose among them.</p>
        <p>History is a train track, a linear progression from past to future: that's the idea embodied in Mazzoni's station. According to Etlin, Sant'Elia laughed at Marinetti's proposal that the future city would be completely remade by every generation. Sant'Elia was right to laugh. The center of Florence looks substantially intact, even though it had to rebuild itself after a second act of global hygiene. What neither man foresaw was that the future would head off in so many different directions, that before the century was over their notion of history would run out of steam.</p>
