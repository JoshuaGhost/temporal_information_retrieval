        <p>The great horse Cigar reasserted his status as racing's probable Horse of the Year, maybe of the decade and possibly of his time when he won the Jockey Club Gold Cup yesterday while Thunder Gulch, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and his chief challenger, ran a distant fifth.</p>
        <p>It was the 11th straight victory for Cigar, who succeeded Holy Bull as the outstanding horse of the American turf last February when Holy Bull broke down during the Donn Handicap and was retired. But it was the first time he had raced against Thunder Gulch, the 3-year-old star who ripped off a string of impressive successes in the Florida Derby, the Kentucky Derby, the Belmont Stakes, the Travers and the Kentucky Cup Classic.</p>

        <p>The great horse Cigar reasserted his status as racing's probable Horse of the Year, maybe of the decade and possibly of his time when he won the Jockey Club Gold Cup yesterday while Thunder Gulch, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and his chief challenger, ran a distant fifth.</p>
        <p>It was the 11th straight victory for Cigar, who succeeded Holy Bull as the outstanding horse of the American turf last February when Holy Bull broke down during the Donn Handicap and was retired. But it was the first time he had raced against Thunder Gulch, the 3-year-old star who ripped off a string of impressive successes in the Florida Derby, the Kentucky Derby, the Belmont Stakes, the Travers and the Kentucky Cup Classic.</p>
        <p>So, they met on the Breeders' Cup Preview day at Belmont Park, casting long  shadows three weeks down the road to the Breeders' Cup with its promise of a return match in the $3 million Classic. But the dress rehearsal yesterday proved no contest: Cigar won it commandingly by one length over Unaccounted For, and then it was almost 10 lengths back to Star Standard and even more to Dernier Empereur and Thunder Gulch.</p>
        <p>"I don't know how you'd get a better horse than Cigar," said Allen Paulson, the onetime airline pilot who names his horses for navigation check points. "When you think there's 20,000-plus foals born every year, it's real big. I think he's a superhorse."</p>
        <p>For Bill Mott, who trains Cigar, the victory was sweet success for his dominant horse, who now enjoys the longest winning streak in recent times. For D. Wayne Lukas, who trains Thunder Gulch for Michael Tabor of Monte Carlo, it was a sobering moment of defeat on a day when he won the Frizette for 2-year-old fillies with Golden Attraction and the Beldame with Serena's Song, who outraced  the queen of New York's fillies, Heavenly Prize.</p>
        <p>On a day of exceptional races aimed at the Breeders' Cup series, Mighty Forum won the Kelso Handicap at booming odds of 65-1, Turk Passer won the Turf Classic at 17-1 and Maria's Mon won the Moet Champagne for 2-year-old colts while Unbridled's Song was running fourth and Hennessy, the prize pupil of the Lukas barn, faded to sixth.</p>
        <p>Somehow, only 15,451 fans showed up for Belmont's special day, which was staged under overcast and occasionally drizzling skies over a track that looked  heavy but was rated "fast." But this was a day when great horses overcame the conditions, and none did it with more power than Cigar.</p>
        <p>"He did what he has been doing all year," Jerry Bailey, his jockey, said. "He didn't handle the track particularly well, but did it all in spite of it."</p>
        <p>Gary Stevens, who rode Thunder Gulch, said: "It was a very tiring track. He just didn't have it today. He was exhausted. But you've got to take your hat off to Cigar, he's a real champion, and he proved how good he is today. Cigar took Thunder Gulch by the horns and forced him to run early, and we just weren't up to it. But we will meet Cigar again at the end of the month."</p>
        <p>He was echoed by Lukas, who offered no alibis, but said: "Gary said he got hit real hard coming out of the gate, and that at no time in the race did he feel real comfortable. I think we needed the race coming off the one in Kentucky two weeks ago. I'm not making any excuses, I think we got beat by a very nice horse. There are things we have to do, and we'll just see what happens on the 28th."</p>
        <p>As expected, the race within the race developed early when Star Standard sprang out of the gate into the lead with Thunder Gulch and Cigar on his heels.  After three-quarters of a mile, Star Standard was still there, and so were his two pursuers. After a mile, it was still Star Standard with Cigar stalking and Thunder Gulch weakening. And finally, as they rolled out of the turn for home, Bailey asked Cigar for more and, with his seemingly effortless acceleration, Cigar gave it.</p>
        <p>He passed Star Standard, who faded to third as Thunder Gulch fell out of the  race. But a late challenge arose when Unaccounted For came digging out of the pack and chased Cigar down the lane. He closed the distance, too, but at the end could get no closer than one length.</p>
        <p>Scotty Schulhofer, who trains Unaccounted For, said he had told Pat Day, Heavenly Prize's jockey: "I didn't think we could beat Cigar, but we had a shot. Bailey even had to hit his horse today."</p>
        <p>Cigar ran the mile and a quarter in 2:011/5 , returned $2.70 for a $2 bet as  the favorite and went home with his 11th straight success and $450,000. He has won $3.2 million while going 9 for 9 this year, and taking in close to $3.5 million over all. He is a 5-year-old son of Palace Music and a grandson of Seattle Slew, and he hasn't been beaten since Mott switched him from grass to dirt running more than a year ago because he wasn't doing so well on the turf.</p>
        <p>"Every time I open my mouth," Mott said, "he goes out and proves he's as good as I say he is. I was confident in him. Watching him from the box, my heart rate wasn't any faster than if I were about to fall asleep.</p>
        <p>"I would agree, it was probably not his best race. He was used more, Jerry had to go to the whip, he had to reach down and ask him. He stayed a little more busy on him, and still he won by a clear length."</p>
        <p>What's next?</p>
        <p>Mott said: "A nice, moderate training schedule for the Breeders' Cup, probably similar to what we did between the Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold Cup.</p>
        <p>"I wish he could talk and tell me exactly what he needs."</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Subplot: NICK ZITO, who has been chasing Thunder Gulch all year with his colts Suave Prospect and Star Standard, finally passed him when Star Standard finished second and Thunder Gulch ran fifth, 14 lengths behind Cigar. "He's a much better horse when you just let him run," Zito said. "He ran great, and I'm  very pleased. But when Cigar was asked to run, he really rolled by everyone." For good measure, Zito's 2-year-old colt, Diligence, ran second in the Moet Champagne to Maria's Mon while Hennessy joined his stablemate Thunder Gulch in limbo.</p>
