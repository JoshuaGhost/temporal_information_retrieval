        <p>Saint James' Episcopal Church was founded in 1810 as a resort parish for wealthy New Yorkers summering in country homes along the East River in what is today the Upper East Side.

He says the reason for the move is still a mystery. "They were very committed to homeless people," Mr. Lasdon said, recalling how Saint James' first welcomed his nonprofit group, the Urban Justice Center, whose main office is in Chelsea. "We had a wonderful history with them. We helped a lot of people, and I hope we can continue."</p>

        <p>Saint James' Episcopal Church was founded in 1810 as a resort parish for wealthy New Yorkers summering in country homes along the East River in what is today the Upper East Side. Besides its blue-blood history, the church, on Madison Avenue near 71st Street, also has a reputation for reaching out to help the poor, the hungry, the elderly, the sick, the uneducated, prisoners and others in need.</p>
        <p>So three months ago, when the church sent a letter telling a free legal clinic for the homeless it could no longer work out of its basement, Douglas Lasdon, who has run the clinic for the last 11 years, was stunned. He says the reason for the move is still a mystery. "They were very committed to homeless people," Mr. Lasdon said, recalling how Saint James' first welcomed his nonprofit group, the Urban Justice Center, whose main office is in Chelsea. "We had a wonderful history with them. We helped a lot of people, and I hope we can continue."</p>
        <p>At first, he thought the legal clinic -- along with a medical clinic and weekly soup kitchen at Saint James' -- was being asked to leave temporarily while the church basement was renovated. But when the other two programs resumed, he realized his three staff aides and three volunteers were barred permanently. Each Tuesday afternoon, they had typically helped 20 to 25 people with problems ranging from qualifying for food stamps to eviction proceedings. The church had provided a small room, a table, chairs and a telephone.</p>
        <p>"There was never a phone call or complaint or warning," Mr. Lasdon said, "and I haven't been able to talk to anybody there." He said that for weeks he called the church and asked to meet with the rector, the Rev. Mark S. Anschutz, or other officials, but that no one was available. Last week, church officials agreed to a meeting after Oct. 10. Mr. Anschutz did not respond to a reporter's repeated requests for an interview. A church spokeswoman who refused to give her name confirmed Mr. Lasdon's chronology, but declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>In its letter ending the legal clinic, Saint James' suggested moving it to All Souls Unitarian Church, at Lexington Avenue and 81st Street. But Mr. Lasdon said schedule conflicts between his clinic and All Souls programs prevented that.And, he said, there is no guarantee his clients from Saint James' would attend homeless programs at All Souls. "Now our clients are lost," he said. "They don't know what happened to us. We didn't have a chance to tell them." B.L.  NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD MYSTERY</p>
