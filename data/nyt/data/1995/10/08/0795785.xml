        <p>FOR 11 years and "for better or worse," as he will tell you, this has been Mayor Ronald A. Blackwood's city. Only now he says the time has come to leave the distribution of I Love Mount Vernon pins to someone else -- along with the drug and crime problems of the city's south side, the million-dollar estates on the north side, the gunshot and stabbing deaths of city youths and the growing ranks of successful middle-class blacks.</p>
        <p>"It's time to step aside, to move on," said Mr. Blackwood, 69. "I've gone as far as I can go."</p>

        <p>FOR 11 years and "for better or worse," as he will tell you, this has been Mayor Ronald A. Blackwood's city. Only now he says the time has come to leave the distribution of I Love Mount Vernon pins to someone else -- along with the drug and crime problems of the city's south side, the million-dollar estates on the north side, the gunshot and stabbing deaths of city youths and the growing ranks of successful middle-class blacks.</p>
        <p>"It's time to step aside, to move on," said Mr. Blackwood, 69. "I've gone as far as I can go."</p>
        <p>The Jamaica-born Mr. Blackwood, who became the first elected black mayor in the state in 1985, has been in politics for 28 years. For two of those years, beginning in 1967, he was a member of the Westchester County Board of Supervisors, and for the next 15 years, he served on the City Council here. He was then elected to serve out the term of his predecessor, Mayor Thomas E. Sharpe, who died in office.</p>
        <p>"It has been my city for a long time," Mayor Blackwood said, "but now it's time for it to be someone else's."</p>
        <p>Four candidates will be on the ballot on Election Day, Nov. 7, seeking the top post in this city of 67,000, where blacks have increasingly moved into public office. Four of the five members of the City Council are black, as are four of the nine members of the School Board.</p>
        <p>Two of the mayoral candidates -- the Democratic nominee, Ernest D. Davis, a County Legislator, and Clyde A. Isley, a former Police Commissioner here who is running on a nonaffiliated line -- are also black. The two others -- the Republican candidate, Emilio John Bosco Jr., a businessman, and the former Democratic City Councilwoman Carmella R. Iaboni, who was endorsed in this election by the Independent Party -- are white.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blackwood observed that "a substantial middle-class black population -- lawyers, doctors, professionals and students going on to Harvard, Yale and Princeton -- have also been able to rise to the top here."</p>
        <p>There are 90 nationalities represented in this city of 4.2-square miles, with whites accounting for about 45 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>The Mayor's supporters, sad to see him leave politics, say that above all they have been touched by Mr. Blackwood's personal leadership style, particularly with the city's youths. They say he has served as an important role model for black children.</p>
        <p>"He will do anything, go anywhere to set a child on the right track," said Dr. Hosea Zollicoffer, principal of Nelson Mandela Community High School, an alternative-education school. "And he is the only Mayor I know who could walk on Third Street, and people would stop and greet him."</p>
        <p>Third Street, Dr. Zollifcoffer explained, "is the strip where much of the drug and crime action is."</p>
        <p>Judge Barbara Gunther Zambelli of City Court credited the Mayor with instituting the city's community service program for youthful offenders who are not incarcerated, the first program of its kind in Westchester.</p>
        <p>The Mayor cited as his major accomplishments efforts to fight crime and drugs, programs to provide affordable housing and formation of the Increase the Peace Committee "to promote mutual respect among the diverse communities of Mount Vernon."</p>
        <p>The Mayor's critics -- particularly the opposition party candidates -- contend that Mr. Blackwood has offered constituents more style than substance and that he has not worked hard enough to reduce residents' onerous tax burden.</p>
        <p>The new Mayor will inherit a wood-paneled office with a crystal chandelier, a limousine and a full-time bodyguard, an $80,000 yearly salary, a $46 million city budget, an $85 million school budget -- and what Mr. Blackwood describes as "all the problems that go along with an aging city."</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, the 57-year-old, six-term County Legislator running with the blessing of Mr. Blackwood's Democratic Party, recently bobbed his waist-length gray hair in anticipation of winning. He said the braid that trailed down his back had become "more of a conversation piece that it was worth." He added, "Some people thought it wasn't mayoral."</p>
        <p>Under former Mayor Sharpe, Mr. Davis, who is an architect, served as the city's Building Commissioner and its Assessor and was chairman of the Planning Commission and the Real Estate Board. He said that of the four candidates, he has the most hands-on government experience at the county and city level.</p>
        <p>Noting that Mount Vernon had "produced pound for pound more talent than most cities," he said he sees Westchester's southernmost municipality now as "lacking a sense of its value." The city has been home to Art Carney, Dick Clark, Sidney Poitier, Denzel Washington and the Delaney Sisters, "to name just a few," he said.</p>
        <p>"Too often people just see the crime on the streets, the problems in the schools and the high taxes, and they lose hope," Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>The Democratic candidate said he would carry on Mr. Blackwood's tradition of setting an example for younger black males to follow and maintaining "a good rhythm" on the street.</p>
        <p>"We've got to go where the problems are, and let the people know we care," he said.</p>
        <p>But the Independent candidate, Mrs. Iaboni, said that style was "perfect in a city with a ceremonial Mayor who just cuts ribbons and kisses babies."</p>
        <p>"Being a Mayor in this city is more than that," she said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Iaboni, 66, became the first woman elected to a political office here when she won a seat on the City Council in 1981. She was City Council President in 1984, and when Mayor Sharpe died, she served as Acting Mayor for three months.</p>
        <p>She deferred to Mr. Blackwood's candidacy in a special election in January 1985 to fill the remaining three years of Mr. Sharpe's unexpired term.</p>
        <p>But in 1987, Mrs. Iaboni waged a primary challenge for the Democratic nomination, only to have her petitions successfully challenged by Democratic leaders. She ran instead as a nonaffiliated candidate, finishing third after Mr. Blackwood and George Albano, the Republican-Conservataive candidate.</p>
        <p>Now as then, Mrs. Iaboni is criticizing the Mayor and the current Democratic administration for failing to counter the city's negative image, which has been associated with its drug problem and crime rate.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview, she criticized Mr. Blackwood for failing to market the city or attract new businesses. Instead, she said the city has become "just a place to dump the county's problems, like its homeless."</p>
        <p>"Everyone feels beaten," she said, criticizing the current administration for garbage on the streets, poor law enforcement and apathy among constituents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosco, the Republican-Conservative-Freedom Party candidate, said he would focus on the city's economic problems first. He has no government experience, and voted for the first time in an election two years ago, saying that before then he had been occupied with other matters. But he said that as a "workaholic businessman," he could turn the city around.</p>
        <p>"We've got to look at Mount Vernon as a business and at the taxpayers as stockholders," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosco, who is 52, owns a company that specializes in restoring burned-out buildings, an entertainment management concern and an investment company. He said his first order of business as mayor would be to restore Memorial Field. His plan is to convert the crumbling stadium to a year-round indoor sports arena. The city plans to lease it to the county, but Mr. Bosco said that would amount to throwing away an important source of revenue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosco said he would do away with the mayoral limousine and chauffeur-bodyguard position. "I have my own Lincoln Town Car," he said. "And if the Mayor needs a bodyguard, what does that say about our citizens' safety?</p>
        <p>"It's a sad state of affairs that our businesses are leaving and you can't even buy a newspaper after midnight because the merchants pull the streets in and leave the world for the criminals."</p>
        <p>Registered as a Democrat, Mr. Bosco garnered the Republican endorsement after successfully challenging Mr. Isley, that party's original candidate, in White Plains Superior Court. Mr. Bosco said some people voting for Mr. Isley during the nominating process were not residents of Mount Vernon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Isley, a private security consultant, emphasizes his background as a former Police Commissioner here and the reduction in the number of serious crimes in the city from 5,057 in 1990 to 1,908 three years later. As Commissioner, he established a community policing program, developed the Gang Related Intervention Program and received two awards from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for his work on an investigation of illegal activities in his department.</p>
        <p>That sting operation resulted in convictions last year and subsequent jail terms for the commanding officer of the department's detective division and two officers in the major-case unit.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the Federal sting, Mr. Blackwood dismissed Mr. Isley, who said he had been under orders not to divulge information about the probe to anyone, including the Mayor.</p>
        <p>The Mayor, who has not commented on the dismissal, said last week that he had dismissed Mr. Isley because of "job performance, not politics."</p>
        <p>Putting that aside, Mr. Isley said that if elected he would create a bipartisan council to give all residents an opportunity to take part in city government. He said he would also conduct town-hall-type meetings with the Mayor, the City Council, the Comptroller and the community. And he said he would "eliminate nepotism and cronyism in hiring and appointment decisions" and seek only those who were qualified and competent.</p>
