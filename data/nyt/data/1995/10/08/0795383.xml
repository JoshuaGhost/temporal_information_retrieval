        <p>Now that Shakespeare in the Park has ended its season, the Joseph Papp Public Theater is presenting its performances outdoors in an entirely different setting.</p>
        <p>Today, stages will be set up along Lafayette Street between East Fourth Street and Astor Place for "A Street Celebration of the Arts in Our Community," sponsored by the Public Theater.</p>
        <p>We have all these great poets, musicians and actors, so we thought we'd spill out into the neighborhood to let people know what we're really about," said Donna Walker-Collins, director of community affairs for the theater, which  is at 425 Lafayette Street.</p>
        <p>The street festival will include performances from the first production of the Public Theater's fall season, "Bring In 'Da Noise, Bring In 'Da Funk," which Ms. Walker-Collins described as "an exploration of the history of the beat through tap and rap," as well as community-based performing arts groups like the Theater for the New City, the World Music Institute and the Nuyorican Poets Cafe.</p>
        <p>Forty vendors will sell everything from T-shirts to books to food from local  restaurants.</p>
        <p>Lafayette Street between East Fourth Street and Astor Place; today, noon to 6 P.M.; rain date: tomorrow; free; (212) 539-8643.</p>
