        <p>Until a year and a half ago, Willie Culpper and his wife, Patricia Palmer, lived in a music school on 69th Street and Roosevelt Avenue, where Mr. Culpper was the building superintendent. He was not paid, but they lived rent-free. Then the school building was sold, and they found themselves on the street.</p>
        <p>Today, they live outside, by the Long Island Rail Road tracks near Queens Boulevard in Woodside. When he can, Mr. Culpper works in landscaping and construction; otherwise, they walk the streets of Queens, collecting cans.</p>
        <p>It's honest money," Mr. Culpper said. "And I'm not taking anything from anybody." Each week, they send $65 or $70 to their five children, who live with  a grandmother in Virginia. They save whatever is left so they can move into an apartment. "All we need is $135 more," Ms. Palmer said. "I think we'll have it in a month."</p>
        <p>Adrift in a borough virtually synonymous with home ownership, the homeless of Queens are an often forgotten, even though they can be found in every neighborhood from Astoria to Arverne. Until recently, homeless outreach efforts  have been concentrated in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>"Although the other boroughs have a significant number of homeless people, they tend to congregate in Manhattan because it's close to transportation and other services," said Susan Wiviott, deputy chief of staff at the city's Department of Homeless Services. "There are lots of outreach efforts revolving around transportation hubs and midtown."</p>
        <p>But attention is now turning to the other boroughs. The Queens Out Reach Project, a $387,000 effort to coax the borough's homeless into shelters run by the Salvation Army, began in March, as did similar programs in Brooklyn and the  Bronx. All three are sponsored by the Department of Homeless Services.</p>
        <p>Queens presents special challenges both for the homeless and for those trying to assist them.</p>
        <p>The airports make Queens a first stop for struggling immigrants, some of whom arrive penniless and are left to wander the streets. The borough's residential neighborhoods make the homeless more conspicuous, leading some to take refuge in hidden places.</p>
        <p>"A lot of people get lost in Queens," said Michael S. Fenner, the director of the Queens Out Reach Project. "You'd be surprised at what we find."</p>
        <p>One surprise came about four months ago, when Hector Alamo spotted a man carrying two buckets of water push his way through the panels of a fence near the Grand Central Parkway in Forest Hills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alamo and his colleagues, Omar Safi and William Catron, work the 4 P.M. to midnight shift, for the Queens Out Reach Project. They cruise the streets in  a white van, searching parks and empty lots and calling out warily into abandoned buildings and highway underpasses.</p>
        <p>They offer bag lunches, which are accepted graciously; conversation, which is accepted cautiously, and transportation to a shelter, which, more often than not, is declined.</p>
        <p>The man with the water buckets was an odd sight in a neighborhood of private  homes with front lawns and backyards. Carrying a flashlight, the team pushed through the fence and discovered an abandoned construction site, where three men live on the first floor.</p>
        <p>The men had tapped into the the building's electrical wiring and installed a  variety of small appliances, including hot plates, a toaster and a television.</p>
        <p>After four months, Mr. Catron persuaded Mr. Avon to go for a medical assessment at Bellevue Hospital Center. Such convincing is not easy, especially  among homeless people who are living with even meager amenities.</p>
        <p>"Those are the hardest to get referred to shelters, because they feel that they have already got all the comforts of home," Mr. Safi said.</p>
        <p>Since the Queens Out Reach Project started, its workers have made contact with 1,700 people, but only about 150 were taken to shelters, Mr. Fenner, the director, said.</p>
        <p>Some are too suspicious to be persuaded. As the white van cruised down Queens Boulevard, Mr. Safi spotted Mr. Culpper walking down the sidewalk with a grocery cart filled with aluminum cans. "Hey, boss, can I talk with you?" Mr. Safi called out the window. "Hey, boss. Hey, boss."</p>
        <p>Mr. Culpper kept walking. Undeterred, Mr. Safi jumped from the van and caught up with Mr. Culpper. "Salvation Army," Mr. Safi said. "How are you doing?" Ms. Palmer walked up and joined the conversation. The couple accepted two bag lunches, but said they were not interested in going to a shelter.</p>
        <p>At Sherry Park on Queens Boulevard, the B Team spoke with Mickey Dattona, who sat at a concrete checker table, drinking a bottle of Midnight Dragon beer and smoking a cigarette provided by Mr. Safi. A thin man wearing a Yankees cap, Mr.  Dattona said he had lived all of his 47 years in Queens.</p>
        <p>"There's three reasons for being homeless on the street, from what I read in  the papers," he said. "Alcohol, drugs and mental illness. I would have to say I  fit all three categories."</p>
