        <p>THE telephone call came after breakfast on a Sunday morning, the time for reading the newspaper and easing into the day, not the time one expects horrific news. Tragedy usually calls at 2 or 3 A.M. It jars you from sleep, each ring sending a shock wave through the adrenal glands. But on a sunny Sunday morning, it could be anyone.</p>
        <p>"I thought it was my sister," Hazel Kaufman of New Hyde Park said. "But it was my daughter Elissa. I thought, 'Oh, good, I'm glad she called.' I wanted to speak to my granddaughter Ericka."</p>
        <p>But in that infinitesimal second between normalcy and the knowledge that one's life is about to change forever, Mrs. Kaufman realized that her daughter was sobbing. "I said, 'What's wrong?' she recalled. "I thought she had some dreaded disease. She said: 'It's Ericka. She's dead.' "</p>
        <p>Ericka Brindl Bishop, the only child of Elissa Bishop-Becker and the only grandchild of Hazel and Milton Kaufman, died six weeks ago at the age of 20. A drunken driver going 90 miles an hour the wrong way down an Interstate crashed into the car that Ericka was riding in. She was but a few days from starting her junior year at Yale University.</p>
        <p>A graduate of Roslyn High School, Class of '93, Ericka had excelled in almost everything she tried, including college. She had been accepted to Harvard, Yale and Princeton.</p>
        <p>"She was a scholar and an artist," said Daniel Jamieson, her 11th-grade English teacher. "She had so much to give. She enriched all of us who knew her."</p>
        <p>"I have never met anybody like Ericka," her best friend from Roslyn, Liz McCann, said. "She could have been the first female President."</p>
        <p>To see any young life end when it holds such promise is certainly painful. To see that life end because of the selfishness of another -- someone who cared more about feeling high then feelings for society -- makes it even sadder. But the tragedy in the death of Ericka goes beyond that. This was a young woman who found good in everyone, although not everyone was good to her.</p>
        <p>"I was 2 years old when my father was shot dead, drunk in a New York City bar," Ericka wrote as the beginning of her college essay. "I didn't even know I had a father. And I wasn't at all interested. My mother and I had left my father when I was 1 1/2 years old. We had moved in with my grandmother and grandfather, so I kind of assumed my grandfather was my father."</p>
        <p>Not the typical beginnings of a North Shore scholar. But then there was little of the ordinary in the brief life of Ericka Brindl Bishop, whose middle name symbolized her biracial heritage.</p>
        <p>Ericka was the union of two diverse cultures. Her father, Rick Bishop, was black, and raised on the streets of Manhattan. Her mother was white and Jewish, a product of suburbia. "I grew up in Great Neck," said Ms. Bishop-Becker, who this summer moved to Williamsburg, Va., with her second husband, the Rev. Randolph A. Becker, a Unitarian minister.</p>
        <p>Ericka's mother was part of a middle-class Jewish family. But then she met Rick Bishop in an acting class in New York City. "It was the 70's," Ms. Bishop-Becker recalled. "He represented another culture to me, another world. I pursued him. He was the excitement of the city. I was a girl from Great Neck, and he was brilliant."</p>
        <p>Their marriage did not last long. Neither family had attended the wedding. The merging of the two cultures "was a bit of an adjustment," Mrs. Kaufman acknowledged.</p>
        <p>But out of the union came Ericka, with bountiful hair and a bountiful smile. "Ericka probably saved my life," Ms. Bishop-Becker said. Her husband had become abusive, she said, and concerned that he might take his rage out on their daughter she took the child and moved in with her parents. "I got an order of protection," she said, "and he stopped coming around."</p>
        <p>A few years later she learned that he had been killed in a bar. "I never even saw a picture of him until I was 14," Ericka wrote in her essay. "I stared at it and felt nothing.</p>
        <p>Ericka's world became the suburban world of her grandparents. For three years she and her mother lived with the Kaufmans. Ericka's grandfather became her substitute father. She called him "Papa." "She really thought my father was her father," Ms. Bishop-Becker said. "We actually had an argument over it."</p>
        <p>Even after Ericka and her mother moved to Roslyn, Mr. Kaufman saw his grandchild every day. "My husband devoted his life to her," Mrs. Kaufman said. "He was in semiretirement. So she never took the school bus. He would pick her up every day after school. He went on school trips with her class. He took her and her friends shopping. She was everything to him, and he was everything to her."</p>
        <p>Overwrought by Ericka's death, and in poor health, Mr. Kaufman declined to talk about his granddaughter. But in the Kaufman house she is everywhere. Her pictures line the bookshelves. Tall, slim with long wavy black hair, she could have been a model. But her grandmother discouraged that. She was eager that Ericka, a National Merit Scholarship finalist, make use of her brains, not her beauty.</p>
        <p>Upstairs, "Ericka's room" is kept the same as when she stayed there as a little child. From Yale, she wrote her grandfather, "It's so nice that you keep a piece of me there." Gifts from her are in every nook and cranny. Hanging in the closet is a "Grandpa" sweater from Yale. On Mrs. Kaufman's dresser is a porcelain heart and the words, "World's Best Grandma."</p>
        <p>"I have never seen such depth of love as in that little girl," Mrs. Kaufman said. "She was tolerant, decent, kind and good. She was our world. And our hearts are broken. This shouldn't happen to decent people.  We should be able to fulfill the life we're promised when we're born."</p>
        <p>Ericka's grandmother has begun a writing campaign to United States senators against drunken driving. Ericka's mother is just trying to get through the pain. When Ericka was 4 the two moved to an apartment in Roslyn. "Primarily because of the school system," Ms. Bishop-Becker said. "I wanted the best for her."</p>
        <p>While the mother worked in her brother Richard's coin store, the daughter made friends in school. "Ericka and I had a lot in common," said Miss McCann who is Irish and was brought up Roman Catholic. The difference in their race and their religion never mattered.</p>
        <p>"She wasn't black, she wasn't white, she was Ericka," Miss McCann said. "And I would go to the Rosh ha-Shanah dinner at her grandparents." When Ericka and her mother joined the Unitarian Church, she would go there with them, too.</p>
        <p>"Ericka taught me so much," her friend said. "She wanted to know everything. We ate sushi together. She introduced me to it. She opened me to life. There is still so much I want to know. I still need her."</p>
        <p>The young woman swallowed a sob. It isn't easy for a 20-year-old to deal with the death of a best friend. "We were always experimenting," she recalled. "I remember in middle school she dyed her hair blue." It was then, Miss McCann recalled, that she saw discrimination against Ericka, but not from white students. It was the black students who shunned her.</p>
        <p>"The black kids said, 'You're trying to be a white girl,' " Miss McCann recalled. "They would yell, 'Sellout!' at her." The prejudice continued through high school.</p>
        <p>"She was interested in the black community and getting to know it," her mother said. "But she was pretty much rejected. They said she was trying to act white."</p>
        <p>So Ericka lived in a white world. But there was sadness that she couldn't have more contact with her black heritage. In her college essay she wrote an imaginary will from her father. "To my daughter Ericka," she said, assuming his identity, "I leave a big part of myself so she never forgets me . . . my skill of photography. . . . I leave her the knowledge that I was an alcoholic so that she may learn control in her drinking habits. . . . And finally something that I regret that I cannot leave my daughter -- my culture, my blackness."</p>
        <p>The talents of Ericka Bishop seemed endless. She was an excellent writer, photographer and artist.  She spent a summer at Oxford when she was 15. In high school she was a peer counselor, as she was at Yale, where she was to have led the freshman-orientation program this year. She loved people and helping them, her family said. To continue that help, she was majoring in American studies and Italian.</p>
        <p>"She expressed a desire to be a teacher," said Mr. Jamieson, who saw her last June. "I thought that would be wonderful, especially because of her background and what she had to offer to the young. She had bridged two worlds with her Jewish and black heritages.</p>
        <p>"She had such a sparkle to her. What she could have brought to teaching. Academia is a serious victim of this terrible crime. The people she would have touched. It crushes me that she had to go in the way she did."</p>
        <p>Ericka was visiting her mother, stepfather and stepsisters in Virginia when the crash occurred. Reverend Becker and Ms. Bishop-Becker were married in 1992. They had only moved to Williamsburg on Aug. 1, after Reverend Becker had been offered a job there.</p>
        <p>Ericka was finishing the best summer of her life, her mother said. "It was just perfect. She was a counselor at Yale. She was coming into her own. She had her first great romance."</p>
        <p>The night of the accident Ericka had gone out with several friends from Yale. They were returning home at 2:45 A.M. when the pickup truck hit them at 90 miles an hour. Miraculously, her friend Kathleen Gilbreath survived. Ericka and their two male friends did not. The driver of the pickup was charged with three counts of involuntary manslaughter, driving under the influence and reckless driving. His preliminary hearing will be held this month.</p>
        <p>Tragedy called the Beckers at 5 A.M. It was the hospital, saying that Miss Gilbreath had been taken there. Nothing was said about Ericka. Ms. Bishop-Becker was afraid to ask. The family rushed to the hospital. "They brought us into this small room," Ms. Bishop-Becker said, "and then they told us Ericka was dead."</p>
        <p>The days following were almost unbearable for the family and friends of Ericka Brindl Bishop. "You just expect her to come knocking at the door," said Miss McCann, who stayed in Virginia for a few weeks with Ericka's family.</p>
        <p>There is more frailness now in her feisty grandmother, and her grandfather spends much time in his room. "I had just been thinking, 'She's safe now,' " Mrs. Kaufman said. "She's past her teen-age years. She's in college. She should go until 2050. She would have fit into the next century so well."</p>
        <p>On the Kaufman table is a copy of "When Bad Things Happen to Good People." "I'm trying to read it," Mrs. Kaufman said. "It's not helping much."</p>
        <p>Since Ericka died the family has recieved more than 150 cards and letters. "From people we didn't even know," Ms. Bishop-Becker said, "saying how she had changed their lives. It's overwhelming how she reached people."</p>
        <p>There will be memorials. Yale is planning one. So is Roslyn High. "The alumni from the Class of '93 want to plant a tree and put a plaque on it," an an assistant principal, Joan Greenfield, said. "And a committee has been formed to collect money for a scholarship in her name. Also her grandmother has asked to speak here." The talk will be sponsored by Students Against Drunk Driving.</p>
        <p>As Ericka's grandmother becomes more vocal in her grief, in Williamsburg her mother is simply trying to go on with life, without the life she bore. There are the stepchildren to consider. Suki is 14, and Lee just started her freshman year at Yale. She and Ericka had planned to be together, especially at freshman orientation, Ms. Bishop-Becker said. Ericka would be in charge of it, Lee would gladly follow her lead. Instead, "it was very hard," the mother said. "On the same day we moved Lee in we had to go to Ericka's apartment and take her things out."</p>
        <p>Two weeks before Ericka died, she wrote another essay. Her mother reads the final words over and over.  "We will put this on her gravestone," she said. Called "Handcuffed to a Rainbow," it is about the wonderful summer that Ericka had and the special friendships that she made. It ends:</p>
        <p>"In my world, friends have been seasons and I have lived treely as a tree can. Shedding, shedding, always shedding friendly aimless leaves. I want, more than everything, to be granted wings and move with the sun, and to be able to hold you close to me. So sing around me, and dance and cry. Yell about frustration and throw things at me. Think about life and touch me and know me. And maybe if I stand really still, and wish really hard for the summer to stay, it won't. But maybe you will."  ABOUT LONG ISLAND</p>
