        <p>Municipal bonds gained a bit more favor in the third quarter, with none of the 751 municipal funds tracked by Morningstar losing money. Concerns about a flat tax proposal battered municipal funds earlier this year; some of those fears have abated, but returns from municipal funds continue to lag behind those of taxable bond funds.</p>
        <p>The taxable funds cooled off a bit from the torrid pace of earlier in the year, but the funds with the longest maturities -- especially the ultra-volatile Benham Target funds -- continue to attract great interest. Those bond funds could be in for further gains if Congress and President Clinton come together with a meaningful deficit reduction package.</p>

        <p>Municipal bonds gained a bit more favor in the third quarter, with none of the 751 municipal funds tracked by Morningstar losing money. Concerns about a flat tax proposal battered municipal funds earlier this year; some of those fears have abated, but returns from municipal funds continue to lag behind those of taxable bond funds.</p>
        <p>The taxable funds cooled off a bit from the torrid pace of earlier in the year, but the funds with the longest maturities -- especially the ultra-volatile Benham Target funds -- continue to attract great interest. Those bond funds could be in for further gains if Congress and President Clinton come together with a meaningful deficit reduction package.</p>
        <p>Funds specializing in convertible securities dot the winners list for the most recent quarter, and those funds are attracting growing amounts of new cash, according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif. Municipal funds, meanwhile, attracted more money than flowed out in the week ended Thursday -- the first time that has happened in a month.</p>
        <p>Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Company, said more cash might be headed toward bond funds. "Demand for credit will slacken, and that will bring about lower rates regardless of what the Fed does," he said. EDWARD WYATT</p>
