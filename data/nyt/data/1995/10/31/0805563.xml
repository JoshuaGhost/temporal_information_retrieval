        <p>IN THE CUT By Susanna Moore 180 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $21.</p>
        <p>If Susanna Moore's latest novel, "In the Cut," were a movie, it would be a stylish, if often farfetched, film-noir thriller starring someone like Sharon Stone or Linda Fiorentino. It would most definitely receive an NC-17 rating.</p>
        <p>Though the novel's themes of rebellion and erotic violence are hardly new to the author, the book is a major departure from Ms. Moore's earlier work. Whereas her previous novels were all Bildungsromans of sorts, tracing the emotional peregrinations of young women trying to reconcile the conflicting demands of family and self, "In the Cut" is a fast-paced murder mystery that moves hurriedly toward its grisly conclusion. Where Ms. Moore's earlier heroines, from Lily in "My Old Sweetheart" (1982) to Clio in "Sleeping Beauties" (1993), struggled to come to terms with the burdens of familial history, her latest heroine -- the unnamed narrator of "In the Cut" -- dwells willfully in an eternal present, trying hard not to care too much about anything or anyone. She  describes herself as a woman "who did not wish to belong to one man," a woman who "did not want to be fixed, to be held down."</p>
        <p>What else do we know about this narrator? Though there are vague allusions to a negligent father and a peripatetic childhood, we aren't told much about her past. We learn that she teaches creative writing to inner-city children, that she is working on a book about slang, that she lives near Washington Square in Manhattan and that her world is about as far from Henry James's Washington Square as you can possibly get.</p>
        <p>One evening, this narrator meets her student Cornelius at a Greenwich Village bar for a drink. She goes downstairs to use the ladies' room and sees, in a basement room, something she cannot forget: a red-haired woman performing oral sex on a man who has a strange tattoo on his wrist.</p>
        <p>As things happen in this sort of novel, the narrator soon makes the acquaintance of a cop named Malloy, who also has a strange tattoo on his wrist.  The cop tells her that he is investigating a murder: the murder of a red-haired  woman whose body has been horribly mutilated.</p>
        <p>Instead of deciding, like any sensible person, that Detective Malloy might not be the best choice for a lover, Ms. Moore's narrator promptly jumps into bed with him. She fantasizes about him when she is alone, and has sex with him as often as she can. She likes listening to him talk, in cop slang, about sex, and  she likes listening to him talk about the unsolved murder of the "disarticulated" woman. She also likes flirting with Detective Malloy's partner, Detective Rodriguez, who has been put on restricted duty for threatening to kill his wife.</p>
        <p>It's not long before ominous things start happening. Ms. Moore's narrator is  mugged one night in SoHo by a man wearing a black stocking mask, and only barely manages to escape. A plastic mannequin's hand is left near her mailbox as some sort of omen or warning. Then, her best friend, Pauline, is brutally murdered, and disarticulated.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, all this makes the narrator nervous. She suspects that her student Cornelius, who has written a term paper on the serial killer John Wayne  Gacy, has been following her around town. She suspects that her old friend John  has been monitoring her comings and goings. And she suspects that Detective Malloy has been lying to her, about his marital status and more. Suddenly, it seems, there is no place to hide, no place "to hedge your bet," no place "free from harm."</p>
        <p>"I do not believe in coincidence when it is manifested in behavior," says the narrator. She does not think any of the things that happened to her were "the result of chance."</p>
        <p>As she has done in earlier books like "The Whiteness of Bones," Ms. Moore draws blunt connections between sex and freedom, shame and punishment, but in this case, she never gives the reader any real insight into her heroine's psyche or her compulsion to sleep with dangerous men. In fact, Ms. Moore seems so intent on creating a character different from her earlier, backward-looking heroines that she has conjured up a disembodied creature subject only to perverse desires and whims. As a result, we have a hard time caring about the narrator, much less believing her incongruous adventures.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, Ms. Moore insists on sensationalizing those adventures with highly graphic descriptions of violence and sex, as if she were trying to translate the work of Joe Eszterhas and Paul Verhoeven to the page. No doubt such descriptions are meant to underscore her characters' uncontrollable passions, but they feel instead like the willful acts of a writer trying too hard to shock her readers.</p>
        <p>What saves "In the Cut" from becoming a run-of-the-mill hothouse thriller --  and what ultimately keeps the reader reading -- is Ms. Moore's strong, tactile prose. While her earlier novels depicted New York in cliched, almost parodic terms as a viper's nest of rich social climbers, "In the Cut" attests to Ms. Moore's acute reportorial skills. Her heroine's interest in language gives her the perfect excuse to regale the reader with lots of slang: police slang, black  slang, teen-age slang, street slang and the simple slang of misused words, and her eye proves just as keen as her ear. She does a nimble job of conjuring up the grungy hip world of downtown Manhattan, and sketching in the gritty lives of people who spend their free time in bars and parks and the street.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Moore had only used the rich gifts for characterization she has lavished on her minor characters on her heroine -- and spent less time trying to startle the reader with gratuitously violent descriptions -- she might have written a novel more commensurate with her rich talents.</p>
