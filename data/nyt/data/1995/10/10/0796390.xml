        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Save the Subways" (editorial, Oct. 5): You are correct in questioning both motives and substance behind the proposed subway fare increase. Serious re-examination of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's plans for capital improvements -- with or without the fare increase -- also needs to be made: witness the two stations at the start and end of my daily commute.</p>
        <p>Renovation of the Bergen Street IND G and F stop in Brooklyn was completed two years ago. One color of tile was replaced by another; lighting was upgraded. On the downside, the new tile has sprouted cracks and bulges, requiring repairs.</p>
        <p>Drainage on the stairwells was badly conceived: water now accumulates in deep puddles where it never did before, and passengers are best advised to wear hip boots during severe rainstorms. Exits to the street were first blocked, then disappeared, replaced by storage closets now used for unknown purposes.</p>
        <p>At the other end, the IND 14th Street A and L station in Manhattan is being redone. "Modernization" seems to mean reducing entrances, removing stairways between the mezzanine and platform, constructing concrete-block tunnels where open space once existed and, as at Bergen Street, concealing storage cubbyholes. Result: many passengers now walk an extra two or three blocks to enter or exit the subway.</p>
        <p>The M.T.A.'s capital plan was conceived during the booming Reagan years, when we thought there was no end to plenty; plenty has disappeared, but the agency is clinging to its legacy. STEPHEN E. PHILLIPS Brooklyn, Oct. 5, 1995</p>
