        <p>New York City's new Schools Chancellor, Rudolph Crew, received Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's endorsement even though he does not meet all of Mr. Giuliani's formerly non-negotiable demands. The Board of Education gave its blessing to Dr. Crew even though his background check had not been completed. Both sides may have feared that unless he could be hired quickly, the city would never find anyone to take the job.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew has not even taken office yet, but he has already been talking energetically about hitting the ground running, setting a new vision and emptying the much-vilified central bureaucracy. To the city, these vows sound very much like those annual predictions that this time the Jets will make it to the Super Bowl. We want very much to believe it can happen, but we have been burned before.</p>

        <p>New York City's new Schools Chancellor, Rudolph Crew, received Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's endorsement even though he does not meet all of Mr. Giuliani's formerly non-negotiable demands. The Board of Education gave its blessing to Dr. Crew even though his background check had not been completed. Both sides may have feared that unless he could be hired quickly, the city would never find anyone to take the job.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew has not even taken office yet, but he has already been talking energetically about hitting the ground running, setting a new vision and emptying the much-vilified central bureaucracy. To the city, these vows sound very much like those annual predictions that this time the Jets will make it to the Super Bowl. We want very much to believe it can happen, but we have been burned before.</p>
        <p>Still, in his early statements the new Chancellor has been targeting all the right areas. Dr. Crew criticized the overreliance on bilingual education, which he rightly believes should be only a short-term aid for immigrant students. He expressed concern about the number of children in special education. He promised to make the budget easy to understand, and vowed to examine every job in the central bureaucracy unrelated to teaching.</p>
        <p>Once he has spent a little time in New York, he may modify some of his other initial reactions, such as his apparent opposition to the condom distribution program. Condom distribution policy was resolved after a long period of painful debate and difficult compromises. The last thing the city's public schools need is to reopen the issue now.</p>
        <p>Dr. Crew says that school safety should be left to the Board of Education, with the city police restricted to screening job applicants. Mayor Giuliani has pressed for total police control. There is plenty of room for compromise, but the new Chancellor should pay careful attention to the Mayor on this matter. The school system has a dreadful record when it comes to running security programs.</p>
        <p>The new Chancellor will also learn that identifying a problem and offering a solution are not enough in this city's school system. Bilingual education, for instance, is controlled mainly by the 32 district boards over which the chancellor has little control. Special education cannot be changed without the approval of the State Legislature and courts. Many administrative jobs exist because the present unwieldy system requires hundreds of people to coordinate tasks that are divided among two, three or even four different levels of government.</p>
        <p>Nothing will really improve in the school system unless the system itself is reformed. Individual schools must be given responsibility for day-to-day operations, lines of authority streamlined, accountability clarified.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the recent chancellor-search crisis, Albany's attention is finally directed toward this critical governance issue. The danger now is that Dr. Crew's selection will remove the impetus. The Legislature needs to press ahead with reform.</p>
