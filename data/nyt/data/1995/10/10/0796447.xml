        <p>Groggy, depressed and exasperated, the Yankees returned to Yankee Stadium yesterday morning with visions of Edgar Martinez, Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey Jr. ruining their first official day off, the sound of Kingdome fireworks and maniacal fans still piercing their eardrums and sheer disbelief clouding their thought processes.</p>

        <p>Groggy, depressed and exasperated, the Yankees returned to Yankee Stadium yesterday morning with visions of Edgar Martinez, Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey Jr. ruining their first official day off, the sound of Kingdome fireworks and maniacal fans still piercing their eardrums and sheer disbelief clouding their thought processes.</p>
        <p>Did Jim Leyritz ever hit a game-winning homer six nights ago for a healthy 2-0 cushion? Were those two games at the Stadium ever played? Or was it all a cruel dream?</p>
        <p>It was no dream, but it was cruel. Any decisive setback in October is disappointing, but this ending was so jolting and so jarring that the Yankees were bitter and bewildered. All they needed was one victory in three games in Seattle to advance to the American League Championship Series for the first time in 14 years. All they got was a one-way ticket home. Possibly forever for some.</p>
        <p>"That's what hurts," said Wade Boggs, through tear-stained eyes. "You know you go around hugging guys and you don't know if you're ever going to see them again. You walk out the door and you might never see them again."</p>
        <p>The tears were because David Cone could not make it through the eighth inning with a 4-2 lead and Jack McDowell could not secure any outs in the 11th in Sunday's 6-5 loss to Seattle. Buck Showalter's wife, Angela, cried outside the Stadium yesterday and for the first time after a season had ended the manager cleaned out his office. The coaches, sitting in the front of the airplane on the journey from Seattle, were eerily silent for most of the five-hour flight.</p>
        <p>Showalter's contract expires at the end of the month and maybe the reason he buried his face in his hands after the loss was because he thinks his managerial stint in New York is nearing its end. George Steinbrenner knows Tony La Russa, Davey Johnson and Sparky Anderson will be available, so the Yankee owner could make Showalter sweat, even if he offers him a contract extension. Or Showalter could simply leave.</p>
        <p>"He deserved to take them as far as he could," said Steinbrenner, when asked about Showalter's future. "Let's not start talking right now. Let's stay with what happened tonight and how proud we are of this team."</p>
        <p>"We all know what can happen," Showalter has said about his perilous status.</p>
        <p>Because the Yankees mishandled a 2-0 lead in the series and botched three leads in Game 5, Showalter, Don Mattingly, 19 other players, General Manager Gene Michael and the coaches trudged into an uncertain future instead of traveling to Cleveland. The future is a mystery because the Yankees have only Paul O'Neill, Ruben Sierra, Tony Fernandez and rehabilitating pitchers Jimmy Key and Melido Perez signed for next season.</p>
        <p>Mattingly, who was brilliant in his first appearance in the post-season, has said he would return if the Yankees want him, but he is saving his decisions for the winter.</p>
        <p>"It's too soon to discuss it," he said. "The finality of everything is so sudden. Tonight, nobody expected to go back home. We all expected to go to Cleveland. We were playing with confidence. In a sense, it's a shock."</p>
        <p>This remarkable five-game tussle, a tug-of-war in which the emotions, the offense and the momentum shifted by the inning and dramatically swayed to whichever team batted last, will be remembered fondly as a classic series. It featured impressive hitting by Griffey, Martinez and Mattingly, splendid pitching by Johnson and Cone and wild finishes to Games 2, 4 and 5. But it only had one winner after Martinez laced one of McDowell's fat split-finger fastballs for a two-run double to erase a 5-4 deficit and kill the Yankees at 11:23 P.M., Bronx time.</p>
        <p>"I kind of feel like I let a lot of people down," said McDowell.</p>
        <p>Cone had similar feelings. He still had a 4-3 lead after Griffey's homer in the eighth, but he issued his first two walks of the game and permitted a single to load the bases with two out. The pinch-hitter Doug Strange was the batter and Cone got one strike before throwing three straight balls. Then Cone rallied with a strike. The count was 3-2. What do you throw?</p>
        <p>Cone thought a forkball was the answer, even though Strange, a .271 hitter this season in 155 at-bats, might not have been able to handle a fastball. The forkball bounced. Ball four. Game tied.</p>
        <p>"You got a split second to make that decision in front of 57,000 roaring fans," Cone said. "It takes some guts to go with that pitch. If I make the pitch, we got a lead going into the ninth. I just didn't make the pitch."</p>
        <p>Neither did McDowell three innings later, after Johnson, on one days' rest, relieved Norm Charlton in the ninth and pitched miraculously until the Yankees scored on Randy Velarde's run-scoring single in the 11th. McDowell needed three outs in his first career relief appearance to send the Yankees to Cleveland for the week. But John Wetteland never budged in the bullpen while Joey Cora's bunt single, Griffey's hard single and Martinez's rocket sent the Yankees home for the winter.</p>
        <p>"There's only one team standing at the end," said McDowell. "When you put the uniform on in spring training, that's what you want to be. The rest of it is a waste."</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner ambled around the clubhouse after the defeat, hugging Steve Howe, squeezing Mattingly's neck after a chat and patting Cone on the back. He spoke of being proud. He talked of frustration setting in later. Obviously, when the frustration festers, changes will come. Still, the owner declined to discuss the future, merely saying the Yankees would hold organizational meetings and make decisions, "in a while."</p>
        <p>"We got a lot of consideration in what we got to do," he said.</p>
        <p>There is much to do. Showalter, Mattingly, Cone, McDowell, Wetteland, Boggs, Velarde, Howe, Mike Stanley and Pat Kelly are among those who may have worn their Yankee uniforms for the final time. It was a memorable fifth game in a memorable series and it might have been their last for New York.</p>
        <p>"That's part of the disappointment, because you don't know what the face of this team is going to look like next year," Cone said. "The right thing to do is to get away, to get a little bit removed from this and put things in perspective before you decide about the future."  PLAYOFFS 95</p>
