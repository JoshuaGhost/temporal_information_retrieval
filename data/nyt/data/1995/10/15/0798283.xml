        <p>IN politics, it is called a "dog-and-pony show." When strip-mine legislation  is being discussed, angry mountaineers show up bearing pails of ugly sediment that washed off the hillsides while some cheery strip-mine lobbyist shows up with a jar of pristine water from a well at the very same site.</p>
        <p>The mountaineers dump the refuse on the floor. The lobbyist swigs the reclaimed water. Show biz.</p>
        <p>Now we have a baseball dog-and-pony show. The Seattle Mariners have dragged  out every trick in their book -- Johnson pitches! Buhner swings! Griffey smiles! -- going on an incredible tear, basically forcing the State Legislature to vote  for a new ball park in a special session.</p>
        <p>Even though they lost to the Indians, 7-0, last night, the Mariners are tied  at two games each and have guaranteed themselves at least one more stand in the  ugly dome that has given them so much energy, but which management cannot wait to abandon.</p>
        <p>The Indians' depth of talent overwhelmed the Mariners in Cleveland, the revived city that has treated the Mariners with a dollop of arrogance. Not only  were the Indians dancing in the dugout with uncollegial glee upon the removal of Randy Johnson on Friday, but Cleveland fans have twitted Mariners' fans about their incessant noise and ingenue enthusiasm. What are 18 lean years in Seattle  compared to 40 deprived years in Cleveland? Indians' fans know how to suffer.</p>
        <p>(Arrogance is not confined to Cleveland. At the other end of the state, Marge Schott refused to take inactive star Jose Rijo to the playoff series in Los Angeles because she wanted to save a seat on the plane. Penny wise, pound foolish. Schott also made them pet her dog for good luck. Her Reds were clobbered out in four straight, 6-0, last night. Unfortunately, Marge Schott is  beyond embarrassment.)</p>
        <p>Just like Seattle, Cleveland once was in danger of losing its team. But new management and enlightened finances produced Jacobs Field right in the heart of  downtown. Somehow even the fabled mists and damps of Lake Erie have been tamed by the rock-and-roll of a real ball park -- and real players.</p>
        <p>Now it's Seattle's turn. Steinbrenner, eyeing the swamplands of New Jersey, and Wilpon and Doubleday, eyeing the north 40 acres at the old Corona Dumps, would love to have their teams go on an emotional dog-and-pony show like the Mariners.</p>
        <p>This team was gone in August. Conservative voters in Seattle were prepared to vote against a new retractable-roof ball park that owners say is necessary. Like every other sports franchise, the Mariners feel they must provide luxury boxes for luxury season ticket-holders to sip luxury white wine and chomp on luxury shrimp with luxury orthodontic teeth. The Mariners must make more money to pay those nasty ball players.</p>
        <p>All was gloom and doom in Seattle -- and this wasn't even the rainy season. The locals trudged around muttering, "They're just a .500 team." The Mariners fell 13 1/2 games behind the Angels, which is precisely the deficit suffered by  the New York Giants in August of 1951, before they caught the Brooklyn Dodgers.  Talk about magic numbers.</p>
        <p>Now there are new magic numbers in Seattle. In Olympia yesterday, the state Senate approved $320 million funding bill to build a real ball park after the House had voted for the bill on Friday. The local county would pay $182 million, state funds would pay a portion, a lottery would kick in some money and wonder of all wonders, the Mariners would contribute $45 million themselves.</p>
        <p>The local funds would be raised from a 5 percent admissions tax at the new stadium, plus a half-cent tax on every dollar spent in Seattle restaurants and a 2 percent car rental tax. Naturally, everybody who comes to Seattle to hike up Mount Rainier or visit the handsome new art museum would be proud to cough up a  little extra money to pay those nasty ball players.</p>
        <p>The latest plan ignored the plight of the Seattle Seahawks, the local football team, which would be the sole inhabitant of the dome. The Seahawks' leverage is terrible -- two victories, three losses, going nowhere. They need to put on a dog-and-pony show.</p>
