        <p>WHEN the curtain rises on "Tosca" this weekend at the Performing Arts Center  at Purchase College, the soprano Stefka Evstatieva will be singing the role she  loves most in opera. Hearing her tell why the character of Tosca is so special reveals as much about Ms. Evstatieva as about Puccini's tragic heroine.</p>
        <p>"She is an artist, a woman, and I'd like very much to be on the stage a woman with pluses and minuses," said the singer, a native of Bulgaria.  Her eyes flashed, her hands flew to her cheeks and her body seemed to dance. "I want to be very strong on the stage as a woman who loves," she said, rolling the R's for emphasis. "And after that, to be very different with Scarpia -- to change the character. Grrr!"</p>

        <p>WHEN the curtain rises on "Tosca" this weekend at the Performing Arts Center  at Purchase College, the soprano Stefka Evstatieva will be singing the role she  loves most in opera. Hearing her tell why the character of Tosca is so special reveals as much about Ms. Evstatieva as about Puccini's tragic heroine.</p>
        <p>"She is an artist, a woman, and I'd like very much to be on the stage a woman with pluses and minuses," said the singer, a native of Bulgaria.  Her eyes flashed, her hands flew to her cheeks and her body seemed to dance. "I want to be very strong on the stage as a woman who loves," she said, rolling the R's for emphasis. "And after that, to be very different with Scarpia -- to change the character. Grrr!"</p>
        <p>She narrowed her eyes and struck out with an imaginary knife, preparing, she said, "to kill Scarpia like a demon!" Then she added demurely, "But I will wait  to see how Franco wants it."</p>
        <p>Franco is Franco Gratale, artistic director of the Westchester Hudson Opera Company. "Tosca" will be the company's first fully staged production, and Mr. Gratale, who has had several false starts in bringing opera to the county, is ecstatic. The company has a new board of directors, offices in White Plains and  a pack of eager volunteers.</p>
        <p>Enough money has been raised in the last year to foot the $85,000 bill for "Tosca," which was chosen, in part, Mr. Gratale said, because this year is the 95th anniversary of the opera. The company's plans include presenting Verdi's "Trovatore" in March and "La Boheme" on the 100th anniversary of that Puccini warhorse in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gratale described Ms. Evstatieva's voice as "very big, very warm and very beautiful." An internationally known singer, she will be featured with Luciano Pavarotti in the Metropolitan Opera's production of Giordano's "Andrea Chenier"  this season. She will also sing at the Met in Verdi's "Masked Ball."</p>
        <p>In "Tosca," the role of Scarpia will be sung by Theodore Lambrinos, a Metropolitan Opera National Auditions winner, while the tenor Richard di Renzi,  winner of the 1992 International Enrico Caruso Competition, will portray Tosca's lover Cavaradossi. Charles Rosekrans, the company's music director, will conduct.</p>
        <p>In a roundabout way, the company owes the presence of Ms. Evstatieva in the cast to her dog, Angus. While singing in Bulgaria a year ago, the artist, who has performed worldwide since her Italian debut in 1982, broke her knee. She broke it when a dog seeking Angus's attention ran into her and she fell.</p>
        <p>It was a bad break, and she canceled almost all her performances for a year.  But she doesn't blame Angus for the ordeal. In an interview recently at her home on a quiet cul-de-sac here, Angus, who howls musically when his mistress vocalizes, chewed a bone at her feet. He is a large black 3-year-old of mixed breed whom the family adopted from a Long Island animal shelter. "The choice was wonderful -- now he's our son," the singer said, beaming.</p>
        <p>She recently stopped using crutches and says she feels fine. "Tosca" will mark her return to the stage and help rebuild her confidence, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Evstatieva likes to talk about rebirth. She was born in Ruse, Bulgaria, and "born again" as a singer on stage there, she said. After a year at home nursing her knee and studying English seriously for the first time, she has begun to regard Westchester "almost like my new native country," she said. "I'm  born here like an American now," she continued with a smile.</p>
        <p>With her red hair, exuberant personality and slightly larger-than-life presence, Ms. Evstatieva might fit anyone's idea of an opera singer. She and her husband, Mladen, an engineer, have lived in New Rochelle for four years, although before her accident, she said, she hardly spent any time here. Their daughter, Valeria, graduated from New Rochelle High School and is now in college at the Rhode Island School of Design.</p>
        <p>Offering her visitor a slice of raisin pound cake -- homemade from "a very easy" Bulgarian recipe, she said -- the singer described the joys and terrors of pouring out her heart in front of large audiences. "Sometimes the public gives you inspiration, and sometimes you feel people are like your enemy," she said. "It's very important to have a good connection with people. "Some people are like snakes -- they hiss. In Europe, they like to be judges. They think singers  have to sound just like the tape."</p>
        <p>Once a French audience booed a tenor who she thought had sung well. "I was so scared, I thought, I'll be destroyed if they boo me too," she said. "I wasn't perfect, but they didn't boo me."</p>
        <p>Ovations, on the other hand, are an artist's lifeblood. "When I had my daughter, people said this is the most magic moment," Ms. Evstatieva said. "That's true, but I asked myself, 'Why I don't feel like that?' But on the stage, when you see all the people standing up, and you see them from the balcony, or you see the flowers, that's a moment that I think, 'Oh, I can die. That's great.' "</p>
        <p>Once a group of children asked for her autograph while she was still on stage. She had no pen, so "at the last minute I kissed their program where my name was," she said. She did that until "I had no more lipstick," and the autograph session was over.</p>
        <p>Ms. Evstatieva sang on behalf of the Westchester Hudson Opera Company at a gala fund-raiser last spring. In July, Mr. Gratale presented a free concert program, which was attended by a full-capacity audience of 600; 400 more were on a waiting list. That showed, Mr. Gratale said, that the time was right for an opera company in the county.</p>
        <p>"I really feel we can make a wonderful culture up here," he said. "We have it already, and opera has to be part of it."</p>
        <p>"Tosca" will be performed Saturday at 8 P.M. and Sunday at 4. After Saturday's performance, a 95th anniversary dinner for "Tosca" will be held in the upper lobby at the Performing Arts Center, at which several luminaries will  be guests, among them the singer Licia Albanese, Simonetta Puccini, the great-granddaughter of the composer, and members of Arturo Toscanini's family.</p>
        <p>Tickets for the opera range from $30 to $40 and can be reserved by calling 946-4555. Tickets for the black-tie dinner are $200 a person.</p>
