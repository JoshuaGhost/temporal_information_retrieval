        <p>For more than a decade, Patisserie Lanciani has drawn a trusty group of 15 or so locals -- artists, photographers, writers, academics and lawyers -- who meet  nearly every morning over coffee (a dollar a cup with unlimited refills) in the  glass-fronted cafe at 271 West Fourth Street and discuss everything from promotions to deconstruction. "I call it a Penny University," said Eric Darton,  a writer. "For the price of a cup of coffee -- a metaphorical penny -- you could get all sorts of knowledge."</p>
        <p>Chances are, not for long. Joseph Lanciani, who opened a takeout bakery with  four counter stools in 1977 and expanded it five years later into a 30-seat cafe that attracted the likes of David Mamet, Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard, is being sued by his landlord for back rent, real estate taxes and a $55,000 water bill.  He is scheduled to appear in Civil Court tomorrow. Regardless of the outcome, he will likely have to move by February, when his lease is up. (His landlord, Geminino Sanz, said he will not renew the lease.)</p>

        <p>For more than a decade, Patisserie Lanciani has drawn a trusty group of 15 or so locals -- artists, photographers, writers, academics and lawyers -- who meet  nearly every morning over coffee (a dollar a cup with unlimited refills) in the  glass-fronted cafe at 271 West Fourth Street and discuss everything from promotions to deconstruction. "I call it a Penny University," said Eric Darton,  a writer. "For the price of a cup of coffee -- a metaphorical penny -- you could get all sorts of knowledge."</p>
        <p>Chances are, not for long. Joseph Lanciani, who opened a takeout bakery with  four counter stools in 1977 and expanded it five years later into a 30-seat cafe that attracted the likes of David Mamet, Jessica Lange and Sam Shepard, is being sued by his landlord for back rent, real estate taxes and a $55,000 water bill.  He is scheduled to appear in Civil Court tomorrow. Regardless of the outcome, he will likely have to move by February, when his lease is up. (His landlord, Geminino Sanz, said he will not renew the lease.)</p>
        <p>The cafe was hurt in recent years by the explosive growth of coffee houses and the trendiness of downtown neighborhoods like SoHo, TriBeCa, the East Village and Chelsea, said Mr. Lanciani. Locals started a petition to save the cafe, collecting 100 signatures before he convinced them their campaign was futile. The group plans to show the petition to Mr. Sanz, hoping it will persuade him to install another cafe. The landlord says he is not sure of his plans for the space.</p>
        <p>Designed by the architect Kevin Walz, Lanciani fuses American Diner with Italian modern, creating an ambience that is both cozy and minimalist. The closely positioned Formica tables, said Peter Rondinone, who found his first book agent there, "create a kind of intimacy." The breakfast club is searching for a new salon. "We have to find some place that will tolerate us," Mr. Rondinone said. "The conversation leaps across tables."</p>
