        <p>Two consumer product marketers are changing agencies.</p>
        <p>The Midas International Corporation named the Chicago office of the J. Walter Thompson Company to handle its national advertising account, with billings estimated at $23 million. The Chicago office of Wells Rich Greene BDDP had handled the account for the last 25 years until resigning in July when Midas began a review.</p>
        <p>The review, which lasted four months, was narrowed to three finalists. In addition to Thompson Chicago, a unit of the WPP Group, they were DDB Needham Chicago, part of the Omnicom Group, and Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis. Midas, owned by the Whitman Corporation, said it would continue working with 14 regional agencies on the local dealer portion of the account; Wells Rich, a unit of BDDP Worldwide, had handled both the national and local portions until they were separated in 1993.</p>
        <p>And Fieldcrest Cannon Inc. in Kannapolis, N.C., selected McKinney &amp; Silver in Raleigh, N.C., to handle advertising for its Fieldcrest and Cannon brands of bed and bath products, which had been handled by Chillingworth/Radding Inc. in New York since 1989. The billings were estimated at $6 million. McKinney &amp; Silver was awarded the account without a review.</p>
