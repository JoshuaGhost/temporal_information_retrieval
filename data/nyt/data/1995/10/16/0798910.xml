        <p>Two Texans, Joe Ely and James McMurtry, shared the bill at Tramps on Wednesday night. Both are storytelling songwriters, singing about restlessness and dead-end lives. But Mr. Ely's music comes from the roadhouse, Mr. McMurtry's from the coffeehouse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ely has never had good career timing. When country music was soft and slick in the 1970's, he was leading a band steeped in Texas honky-tonk; when country rediscovered honky-tonk, he was toying with computers and rocking like the Rolling Stones. Yet amid the shifting styles were intelligent songs with a deep sense of place, and Mr. Ely's voice -- a weathered tenor with a nervous edge -- always made them vivid.</p>

        <p>Two Texans, Joe Ely and James McMurtry, shared the bill at Tramps on Wednesday night. Both are storytelling songwriters, singing about restlessness and dead-end lives. But Mr. Ely's music comes from the roadhouse, Mr. McMurtry's from the coffeehouse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ely has never had good career timing. When country music was soft and slick in the 1970's, he was leading a band steeped in Texas honky-tonk; when country rediscovered honky-tonk, he was toying with computers and rocking like the Rolling Stones. Yet amid the shifting styles were intelligent songs with a deep sense of place, and Mr. Ely's voice -- a weathered tenor with a nervous edge -- always made them vivid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ely's new album, "Letter to Laredo" (MCA), could be timed for the era of Nafta. The music hovers at the Texas-Mexico border while thinking of Spain, with a mariachi lilt in the rhythm section and Teye, from Sevilla, picking flamenco guitar. The lyrics are about border crossings, divided loyalties and distant lovers.</p>
        <p>Mr. McMurtry's emotional span is narrower: from resignation to despair to bitter nostalgia. That suits his bedraggled moan of a voice. But Mr. McMurtry has learned from songwriters like Bob Dylan and Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits how to thrive within limitations. His lyrics depict landscapes and states of mind with stark precision. And as he led his trio with his intricately finger-picked guitar, the folk-rock vamps rolled along like a midnight drive on  a deserted prairie road.</p>
