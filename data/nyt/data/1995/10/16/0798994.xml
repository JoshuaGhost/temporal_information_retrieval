        <p>The last time DANIELE BARIONI, an Italian tenor who was a highly regarded singer at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1950's, and JOE LOMBARDO , an insurance broker, saw each other, it was at Mr. Lombardo's wedding in June 1967.</p>
        <p>The two were friends, and Mr. Barioni sang "Ave Maria" and "Because" at the ceremony.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, he repeated his performance at another wedding, that of Mr. Lombardo's daughter DANIELLA LOMBARDO to JOHN BENEDETTO at St. Jean Baptiste Church on Lexington Avenue.</p>
        <p>It was the first meeting between the two men in 28 years. Mr. Barioni gave up a successful career in opera in this country when his wife, mother and sister all died in 1963. He returned to his hometown in Italy and came back here only once -- for that wedding.</p>
        <p>"I named my daughter for him," Mr. Lombardo said the other day, "and I called him the moment she announced her wedding date. We simultaneously agreed that he should be here to sing." And so he did, at the church, at the reception in the Hudson Theater on West 44th Street and afterward in the street, where he did 'O Sole Mio' for passers-by.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barioni, who attended the festivities with his mentor of long ago, Licia Albanese, the soprano, said, "I told Joe, 'I only sang 'Ave Maria' for you and again at her wedding. I will never sing it again except at your other daughter's wedding.' It makes me too emotional." NADINE BROZAN</p>
