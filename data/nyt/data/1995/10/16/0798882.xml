        <p>The Westinghouse Electric Corporation said it had reached a settlement with the Government of the Philippines that ends litigation over an idled nuclear-power plant and lifts that nation's ban on Westinghouse products.</p>
        <p>While terms were not disclosed, Westinghouse said late Friday that it would take a $45 million charge for the settlement in its third quarter.</p>
        <p>The Philippine Government agreed to drop a 1988 lawsuit that accused Westinghouse, which is based here, and Burns &amp; Roe Enterprises of bribing Ferdinand E. Marcos in the 1970's to win the contract to build the $2.2 billion  plant. It also agreed to rescind its two-year-old ban on Westinghouse products.</p>
        <p>The "amicable settlement" is less than the $200 million payment Manila proposed last month, a Westinghouse official said.</p>
        <p>Westinghouse finished building the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant in 1985, but the reactor never operated because of the Government's safety concerns and the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>While the 620-megawatt nuclear plant has not produced any electricity, Westinghouse insists it is safe. Consultants hired by the Philippine Government  say it is not. The Government plans to convert the plant to run on a traditional energy source.</p>
        <p>The Philippine Government filed an appeal after Westinghouse and Burns &amp; Roe  were exonerated in 1993 when a Federal District Court jury in New Jersey found no evidence of bribery in their verdict on the lawsuit. Manila later banned Westinghouse equipment when settlement talks broke down.</p>
