        <p>Mary Chapin Carpenter has a gift for details. In her lyrics she hears the way an old staircase groans, sees a cup of coffee growing cold, recalls how a young  bride wore her mother's lace. And when she brought her band to the Paramount on  Tuesday night, the music was full of subtleties, as when the country-rock of "I  Take My Chances" faded down to a ticking cymbal and veiled guitar chords. Her straightforward voice rarely calls attention to itself; she warms melodies, enunciates words and lets ballads grow tender but not sentimental. Her attention to small things serves a larger purpose: to illuminate everyday lives by showing them clearly.</p>
        <p>The characters in Ms. Carpenter's songs aren't heroic. They're adults who have settled down but don't feel settled; they endure breakups, abandonment and  uncertain new starts. In "The Last Word," a resolute march, the narrator decides, "I'd rather walk away"; in the bluesy "Shut Up and Kiss Me," a woman drops her own reserve. Ms. Carpenter's characters are scarred but determined, and they don't expect much. But they are, in the end, willing to try again, and  to have a good time when they do.</p>

        <p>Mary Chapin Carpenter has a gift for details. In her lyrics she hears the way an old staircase groans, sees a cup of coffee growing cold, recalls how a young  bride wore her mother's lace. And when she brought her band to the Paramount on  Tuesday night, the music was full of subtleties, as when the country-rock of "I  Take My Chances" faded down to a ticking cymbal and veiled guitar chords. Her straightforward voice rarely calls attention to itself; she warms melodies, enunciates words and lets ballads grow tender but not sentimental. Her attention to small things serves a larger purpose: to illuminate everyday lives by showing them clearly.</p>
        <p>The characters in Ms. Carpenter's songs aren't heroic. They're adults who have settled down but don't feel settled; they endure breakups, abandonment and  uncertain new starts. In "The Last Word," a resolute march, the narrator decides, "I'd rather walk away"; in the bluesy "Shut Up and Kiss Me," a woman drops her own reserve. Ms. Carpenter's characters are scarred but determined, and they don't expect much. But they are, in the end, willing to try again, and  to have a good time when they do.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter records for Columbia's Nashville division, has won country Grammy Awards and is heard most often on country-music stations. But she doesn't pretend to be a country gal. She grew up in New Jersey, Japan and Washington, and most of her songs are closer to folk-rock and to 1970's confessional ballads than to three-chord country tunes. In her more ambitious songs, she looks beyond the domestic sphere: "John Doe No. 24" imagines the life of a deaf and blind man, institutionalized for 49 years; "I Am a Town" sketches a landscape of a place that's "a blur from the driver's side."</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter performed while surrounded by framed pictures (including two Hoppers), black-and-white photographs of couples and various keepsakes, each lighted for the appropriate song. But that was the least subtle aspect of a concert that cracked a few jokes and touched a lot of heartstrings.</p>
        <p>The Mavericks, a band from Miami that opened the show, are classicists who set out to preserve 1950's and 60's Americana. Their own songs sat comfortably alongside "Blue Moon" and "Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down." They followed the genre rules for rockabilly, honky-tonk country, folk-rock and Tex-Mex pop, with  lyrics that were archetypal and earnest: "I should have been true."</p>
        <p>Raul Malo sang with poised, earnest sincerity, particularly when his voice climbed toward Roy Orbison peaks of vulnerability. Yet in its flawlessness, the  music was also hermetic and studied until the Mavericks played "From Hell to Paradise." That song, about Mr. Malo's grandmother leaving Cuba after 30 years under the Castro Government, took on a passion that was more than archival.</p>
