        <p>RALPH LAUREN, the purveyor of tweedy clothing and Old World atmosphere, has been an insatiable collector of arcane, often English furniture and decorations that have served as backdrops and props in his shops and showrooms (but not his own living rooms). Even Mr. Lauren runs out of storage space. Yesterday, he sold 443 lots of European and American furniture -- some antiques, others vaguely old -- for $2.5 million (including buyers' premiums) at Sotheby's in New York.</p>
        <p>The sale's top bid of $290,000 came near the end of the afternoon session for a Gobelins tapestry showing two oxen pulling a cart. The bid far exceeded the auction house's estimate of $60,000 to $80,000.</p>

        <p>RALPH LAUREN, the purveyor of tweedy clothing and Old World atmosphere, has been an insatiable collector of arcane, often English furniture and decorations that have served as backdrops and props in his shops and showrooms (but not his own living rooms). Even Mr. Lauren runs out of storage space. Yesterday, he sold 443 lots of European and American furniture -- some antiques, others vaguely old -- for $2.5 million (including buyers' premiums) at Sotheby's in New York.</p>
        <p>The sale's top bid of $290,000 came near the end of the afternoon session for a Gobelins tapestry showing two oxen pulling a cart. The bid far exceeded the auction house's estimate of $60,000 to $80,000.</p>
        <p>At the morning session, Mariette Himes Gomez, a New York interior designer who later bid $4,500 for an Italian Renaissance mantel, said: "A very small crowd. There are not a lot of people here because this is about style and not serious stuff." Just serious prices.</p>
        <p>The Ralph Lauren Collection sale was the second in three designer-related auctions at Sotheby's. The first was the Sister Parish sale, which brought $1.36 million on Sept. 29. The third will be the Robert H. Metzger sale on Oct. 27. All offer objects with patina -- the owner's.</p>
        <p>The morning session ended with a bid of $450 for a 1929 wool riding jacket. "This would be a great Halloween costume," said Diana D. Brooks, the president and chief executive of Sotheby's Holdings, who had stepped up to the rostrum as auctioneer around Lot 110.</p>
        <p>When she glanced at Lot 148, a horn and alligator armchair and matching stool, Mrs. Brooks said, "I don't know how to describe this." Her comment drew laughter and a bid of $15,000.</p>
        <p>A 1923 pen-and-ink drawing by Henry Mayo Bateman of the "Perfect Pet," a toy man, sold for $2,800, three times the high estimate.</p>
        <p>Dogs, the essential element of style in English country house decor, put on a good show: a sweet-looking setter, a striking hound and threedogs snarling at a fox. So did an American Empire mahogany bedstead, with tartan bed hangings. Estimated at $3,000 to $4,000, it sold for $6,500. That may be because, contrary to what the catalogue said, the linens were included.</p>
