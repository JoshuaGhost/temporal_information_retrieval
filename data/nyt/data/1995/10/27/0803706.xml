        <p>The Estee Lauder Companies, the prestige cosmetics maker that is preparing to sell shares to the public, said yesterday that it had established a strategic alliance with Bobbi Brown Professional Cosmetics Inc., a line of makeup-artist cosmetics.</p>
        <p>Makeup-artist cosmetics, which feature a wide range of colors packaged in inexpensive containers, are the hottest segment of the high-end color cosmetics  market.</p>
        <p>While Bobbi Brown will retain control of its North American operations and product development worldwide, Lauder plans to build the brand internationally,  using its vast and powerful global distribution network.</p>
        <p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed, though they are likely to be incorporated in the prospectus related to Lauder's initial public offering -- expected later this year. Industry analysts said Bobbi Brown had been seeking a  buyer to finance its growth for some time.</p>
        <p>Lauder, which owns the Clinique, Prescriptives and Aramis lines as well as its flagship brand, has a similar arrangement with Bobbi Brown's biggest rival,  M.A.C.</p>
