        <p>A police sergeant who arrested New Jersey Nets forward DERRICK COLEMAN in June is suing his superiors and Coleman, saying they slandered him. The officer, Sgt. JOHN PIETRZAK, a Detroit police officer for 23 years, contends in his lawsuit that Police Chief ISAIAH McKINNON and Executive Deputy Chief BENNY NAPOLEON ignored evidence and held a news conference with Coleman in an attempt to keep him from filing a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, contends that Coleman committed assault and battery against Pietrzak by resisting arrest. Coleman was arrested outside a night club June 24. Police reports show he had cursed police officers and refused to move his truck, which was blocking traffic. McKinnon said at a news conference which was blocking traffic. McKinnon said at a news conference with Coleman that Coleman had surrendered peacefully. An initial police report had indicated that Coleman had "struggled" with officers. Coleman's disorderly conduct case is scheduled for trial next week. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE: BASKETBALL</p>
