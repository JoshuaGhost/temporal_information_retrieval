        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding Medicare "reform," no one seems to be addressing the drastic difference between a 65-year-old and an 85-year-old. At 65 years my father was still working as a physician and my parents were traveling and leading an active social life. Twenty years later my father is deceased and my mother resides in a nursing home, wheelchair-ridden and with severe dementia.</p>

        <p>Regarding Medicare "reform," no one seems to be addressing the drastic difference between a 65-year-old and an 85-year-old. At 65 years my father was still working as a physician and my parents were traveling and leading an active social life. Twenty years later my father is deceased and my mother resides in a nursing home, wheelchair-ridden and with severe dementia.</p>
        <p>My parents were elderly when the AT&amp;T divestiture took place, and they were unable to cope with the complexities of choosing a new phone company! Until the end, they stayed with AT&amp;T and their rented, antiquated black rotary telephone.</p>
        <p>Does anyone in his right mind expect the "old" elderly to rejoice in being able to choose a health care plan? One would think Republicans had no parents.  JUDY SMITH  Stony Brook, L.I., Oct. 24, 1995</p>
