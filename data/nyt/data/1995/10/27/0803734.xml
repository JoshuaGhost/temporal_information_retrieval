        <p>YEARS before he went Hollywood, directing Harrison Ford as the ultimate C.I.A. agent in "Patriot Games," Phillip Noyce made one of the smartest and most Australian movies of the past few decades. "Newsfront" (1978) begins with documentary film of Chico Marx, in Sydney in 1948, leading a makeshift chorus of Australian military men. "How about a little song?" Chico asks. "It's something  about a bum walking along the road and he meets some dame named Matilda."

Australians know Matilda is not a woman; it's a knapsack.</p>
        <p>Combining documentary film with the fictional drama of rival newsreel companies in the 1940's and 50's, "Newsfront" displays a savvy sense of how Australia's image -- simple and hearty on the surface, infinitely complicated beneath -- plays to the world and at home.

        <p>YEARS before he went Hollywood, directing Harrison Ford as the ultimate C.I.A. agent in "Patriot Games," Phillip Noyce made one of the smartest and most Australian movies of the past few decades. "Newsfront" (1978) begins with documentary film of Chico Marx, in Sydney in 1948, leading a makeshift chorus of Australian military men. "How about a little song?" Chico asks. "It's something  about a bum walking along the road and he meets some dame named Matilda." The soldiers laugh before they launch into "Waltzing Matilda," a decidedly unromantic song about a hobo who kills himself rather than go to jail as a sheep thief. Australians know Matilda is not a woman; it's a knapsack.</p>
        <p>Combining documentary film with the fictional drama of rival newsreel companies in the 1940's and 50's, "Newsfront" displays a savvy sense of how Australia's image -- simple and hearty on the surface, infinitely complicated beneath -- plays to the world and at home. On the skids, the chairman of one news company calls for more stories about the outback, kangaroos and koalas. He  is a cosmopolitan businessman, hoping to give ordinary Australians what he imagines they'll eat right up.</p>
        <p>Newsfront" is as timely as ever. Watch American television today and you'll find Paul Hogan, famous as Crocodile Dundee (the Australian as stubborn, good-natured lout), in a commercial for a car called the Subaru Outback. But go  to the Museum of Modern Art and you can look behind the stereotypes, in a huge,  revealing series called "Strictly Oz: A History of Australian Film." The well-named series -- alluding to a nickname for Australia, as well as the Oz-like wonder of its films -- begins today and runs through Jan. 18, with 100 movies that range from a fragment of the 1906 "Story of the Kelly Gang," one of  the first features ever made, to recent hits like the hilarious "Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert" and that talking-pig phenomenon "Babe."</p>
        <p>This weekend offers a neat sampling of the series' major threads: masterpieces, discoveries and cultural touchstones. It opens this afternoon with a modern classic, Gillian Armstrong's still-irresistible film "My Brilliant Career" (1979). It continues this evening with "Fran," an uneven 1985 film that  has never been released in the United States, about a well-meaning but irresponsible single mother, and "Jedda," a 1955 film about an aboriginal girl raised in a white household, which offers an astonishing window on Australian culture of the period.</p>
        <p>Along the way, these films suggest strong crosscurrents between American and  Australian society, a bond that goes beyond a common language. Many films that deal with aborigines bring to mind the history of American Indians and, more directly, race relations between black and white Americans. The vast open landscape and the sheep and cattle ranches of Australia have their parallel in American westerns. So does the violent outlaw streak. And more recent films suggest a shared sense of urban strife.</p>
        <p>These similarities don't deny what is unique about Australian culture and film, but they may help explain why so may Australian directors make such smooth transitions to Hollywood. In addition to Mr. Noyce, there are a half-dozen directors, represented in this series by dazzling and distinctively Australian works, whose recent films seem purebred American. Among them is Bruce Beresford, whose career takes him from the lovely, sad, small-scale story of an  aborigine family in "The Fringe Dwellers" to "Driving Miss Daisy." Fred Schepisi moves from the outsize drama of an aborigine on a murderous rampage against whites at the turn of the century in "The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith" (one of the most powerful of all Australian movies) to the subtle racial conflicts in his utterly New York "Six Degrees of Separation." Peter Weir goes from emotionally haunted schoolgirls in his Australian "Picnic at Hanging Rock" to emotionally haunted schoolboys in his American "Dead Poets Society." And looking back, it's not such a leap from the strong-willed Sybylla Melvyn of "My Brilliant Career" to another 19th-century proto-feminist, Jo March, in Ms. Armstrong's recent Hollywood version of "Little Women."</p>
        <p>Women as Directors</p>
        <p>This series is especially attentive to women directors, and it brings together many of Ms. Armstrong's lesser-known works, with a gathering of tough-minded heroines who hide their emotional wounds. "One Hundred a Day," an eight-minute black-and-white film shown with "My Brilliant Career," is a tense and brutally effective little story that juxtaposes scenes of a single woman going to an abortionist with scenes of her and her friends cutting leather in a  factory. In the lyrical 52-minute film "The Singer and the Dancer," a half-crazed older woman warns a younger one not to make her mistakes in marriage. And the series includes Ms. Armstrong's most underrated work, "High Tide," in which Judy Davis plays a mother who has left her young daughter behind, only to have her past boomerang.</p>
        <p>Though it appeared two years later, "High Tide" casts a long shadow over "Fran," directed by Glenda Hambly. The film is notable for its terrific performance by Noni Hazlehurst as a flighty mother who always considers a fling  with a new man more important than staying with her children. Herself the product of foster homes and an abusive childhood, Fran has an unlimited hatred of social workers. As intelligent and trailblazing as the film is, it seems flat next to two later, better, more familiar films: "High Tide" and the English director Ken Loach's "Ladybird, Ladybird."</p>
        <p>In fact, mining this series for unknown works of genius is not the best approach. After the Australian Film Commission was formed in the early 1970's to shore up the foundering industry, the world soon received the burst of first-rate films now known as the Australian New Wave. It's safe to say that the masterpieces, like "Hanging Rock" and "Jimmie Blacksmith," got here. The lesser-known works in the series are quirky and worthwhile, though often flawed.</p>
        <p>Stories of Racial Conflict</p>
        <p>They can also be fascinating, like "Jedda," which has an important place in  the history of Australian film. Its director, Charles Chauvel, made films from the 1920's into the 50's. "Jedda" has an epic look, with magnificently photographed natural locations. It also has a gripping story and discomforting attitudes that make it a time capsule of race relations. The first film to cast  aborigine actors in lead roles, it carries a proud statement on screen: "To cast this picture the producers went to the primitive aborigine race of Australia." The narrator says of Jedda, the girl taken in by a white rancher and his wife, "Like Topsy, she just growed."</p>
        <p>Jedda's cultural conflict is unresolvable. Her foster mother thinks she's being kind by raising Jedda to be like white people; her foster father thinks education is a waste for aborigines, and believes he's being realistic. The film becomes campy when Jedda tries to practice the piano and has the music interrupted by tribal rhythms in her head. But the film is a powerful example of a major theme in Australian films: racial conflict and confusion that ends in violence. Drawn to a character referred to as "half-caste Joe," Jedda is kidnapped by a man from a darker-skinned tribe and the story comes to a deadly end.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Beresford's 1986 "Fringe Dwellers" suggests, racial conflicts remain,  informed by a different sense of possibilities. The teen-age heroine wants a better life. Her mother, in an exquisite scene, mourns the passing of their old  aboriginal language. And when a teen-age aborigine girl sneers at some flirtatious aborigine boys, one of her girlfriends says: "I don't know what you  expect. Mel Gibson? Bryan Brown?"</p>
        <p>Well, yes, maybe she does. The Australian New Wave has been around long enough to shape a generation. George Miller's "Mad Max" (1979) will be shown in  this series in its original form, with Mr. Gibson's voice. When the film was released here, he was just an unknown actor with an Australian accent so thick that his voice was dubbed. He spoke for himself two years later in "Mad Max 2 (The Road Warrior)," a masterwork masquerading as an action movie. The ominously apocalyptic open roads and sinister urban oases of the "Mad Max" films are an updated version of a characteristic Australian theme: the landscape as brooding  and Gothic.</p>
        <p>However different their styles -- dark humor, fantasy and realism are all represented -- these films convey a toughness and independence that define the Australian cinema as well as any generalization can. Ken Hannam's "Sunday Too Far Away" (1975) was one of the first Australian films to gain international notice, though its style is staid and claustrophobic, unlike the vibrant intensity of most New Wave films. The story of sheepshearers in the 1950's, it becomes a study of the national character when the shearers go on strike against a wage cut. As the end titles explain: "The strike lasted nine months. The shearers won. It wasn't the money so much. It was the bloody insult." As an antidote to the glibness of " 'Crocodile' Dundee," you can't do better.</p>
