        <p>Talks at Historical Society</p>
        <p>Don't be fooled by the seemingly quiet mood at the New-York Historical Society: interesting behind-the-scenes negotiations are in progress.</p>
        <p>Merger talks have begun again between the society and the Museum of the City of New York. The last time the idea surfaced was in 1992, but those talks led nowhere. Neither institution would discuss what's going on, but those close to City Hall say Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is taking a personal interest in trying to make the merger happen.</p>
        <p>Colleen Roche, the Mayor's press secretary, said: "Discussions to see whether a merger would be beneficial are very preliminary. At the request of the Mayor and John Dyson, the Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, Schuyler Chapin has been made available to participate in discussions." Mr. Chapin is the city's Commissioner of Cultural Affairs.</p>
        <p>A report to the board of the Museum of the City of New York said that the Mayor had "asked the museum to take a leadership role in seeking a permanent solution to the society's chronic problems."</p>
        <p>While the two institutions have similar missions -- to celebrate the city's rich cultural history -- each is in a period of flux. The Museum of the City of New York is involved in a capital campaign to start a $36 million renovation, expansion and reorganization of its 1932 Neo-Georgian building at Fifth Avenue and 103d Street. The city, which owns the building, is paying for half the project.</p>
        <p>The Historical Society had its own facelift and reopened its doors in May after having been closed for two years. Despite its spiffier premises, it is struggling to pull itself out of serious financial problems. The city and New York State have provided $12.6 million and the State Attorney General's office, which oversees nonprofit institutions, allowed the society to sell a selection of Old Master paintings and Americana to raise money.</p>
        <p>Most of the art and objects were sold at Sotheby's in New York in January in a sale that made $17.6 million. Fifteen marine paintings that were part of the original consignment sanctioned by the Attorney General's office were sold at Sotheby's on Sunday, and the Historical Society is $611,300 richer for it. The paintings were by the 19th-century New York artist James Bard.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's sold 26 Bards in January and decided it was dangerous to try to sell them all then. "Under normal circumstances, we usually see two or three Bards a season, and we were worried about flooding the market," said Nancy Druckman, head of Sotheby's department of American Folk Art. "So we saved this core group until now."</p>
        <p>Among the top sellers were "Steamboat Thomas P. Way" (1859), estimated to sell for $25,000 to $35,000; it sold to an unidentified collector for $112,500. Under the society's original agreement with the Attorney General's office, other New York State institutions can exercise a right of first refusal for any work at auction, and have a week after the sale to act. If something sells for its high estimate, the society gives the pre-empting institution a graduated discount. A Sotheby's spokesman said no institutions had pre-empted any of Sunday's Bard sales. For Korean Art</p>
        <p>Two Korean foundations, the Korea Foundation and the Samsung Foundation, have given the Metropolitan Museum of Art a $5 million grant to develop a Korean arts program and a new gallery devoted to the arts of Korea. "This will encourage the development of our collections in this area, from the ceramics we now display to a well-rounded collection that represents the spectrum of artistic achievements of this rich culture," Philippe de Montebello, the Metropolitan's director, said.</p>
        <p>The new gallery is expected to open at the end of 1997. The Korean Foundation will pay for the gallery's construction, while the Samsung Foundation will support the program, including displaying the art and educational programs.  Christie's Campaign</p>
        <p>Christie's latest marketing effort has gone beyond fancy shopping bags or scarfs or chocolates.</p>
        <p>Fifty-five thousand subscribers to Christie's International Magazine received a special all-color brochure about the auction house's 19th- and 20th-century picture departments. But the art wasn't what Christie's seemed to be selling. The message was all about the "youth and experience" of its staff.</p>
        <p>The lavishly produced, 13-page brochure was shot by Derry Moore, the English photographer known for his glamorous interior photographs in Architectural Digest. Each Christie's expert is posed on a separate page with a painting offered for sale this fall. Each expert either wears an outfit color-coordinated with the painting or poses in a manner similar to a figure in the work, sort of an artsy version of the way real estate agents and new car salesmen sell themselves these days.</p>
        <p>"We were deliberately breaking new ground here," said John Lumley, the international head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century paintings department, who masterminded the brochure. Mr. Lumley (the only expert not pictured) said he believed it was important to "sell the people concerned," adding, "They are stars in their world."</p>
        <p>About half the experts have held their jobs less than a year, but Mr. Lumley said that had nothing to do with the concept. "These experts form an important part of our international network," he said. "We were not ignoring the works of art; it's the whole package that's important." A Contemporary Arrival</p>
        <p>The long-awaited Jeffrey Deitch gallery, which has been hovering in the art world's imagination for nine months, has finally touched down. Mr. Deitch, a leading contemporary art dealer and adviser, has teamed up with Jeanne Greenberg, who has worked with him for about two years as director of his art advisory service. They have formed a joint enterprise called Deitch Greenberg Projects.</p>
        <p>Its new home is the former Joe Fawbush Gallery, which closed this month after Mr. Fawbush's death in June. It is a modest but unusually beautiful space at 76 Grand Street in SoHo, which Mr. Deitch and Ms. Greenberg are planning to use as a project space for emerging and established artists. "We're planning to invite artists to do special installations," Ms. Greenberg said.</p>
        <p>The gallery will open temporarily in November. Then the space will close for renovations in December and reopen in January.</p>
