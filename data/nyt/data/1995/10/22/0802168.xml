        <p>When Wayne R. Bryant of Camden was majority leader of the Democratic-controlled Assembly in 1991, he led the drive to overhaul New Jersey's welfare system, with an emphasis on promoting family responsibility.</p>
        <p>The change that received the most attention prohibited women on welfare from collecting additional benefits -- usually $64 a month -- for children they conceived while on welfare. Those mothers, however, could go to work and earn up to 50 percent of their welfare grant without penalty, and women who married someone other than the child's natural father could continue to receive welfare for their children, although their own benefits were discontinued.</p>
        <p>Now a State Senator, his party in the minority, Mr. Bryant, 47, has become a vocal critic of the welfare measures being debated in Washington -- even though the Republican-controlled House wants to institute a national "family cap" that resembles the one he pioneered in New Jersey. Last week, he was invited to discuss New Jersey's law and the problems he sees with the federal proposals.</p>
        <p>Q. What was your goal in revamping New Jersey's welfare system?</p>
        <p>A. We had two major purposes: to bring families together, because forming a nuclear family is the best way to make people self-sufficient, and to get people in poverty to live life by the same standards as the rest of working America. We all have to take responsibility for our actions, whether that is in having additional children or trying to better our lives and our children's lives.</p>
        <p>Q. You feel that one way to make welfare mothers take responsibility for their actions is to deny them additional benefits for children conceived after the family is on welfare. Why, then, do you oppose the Federal bill?</p>
        <p>A. The Federal proposal has the same problems as many other state laws: it deals with welfare piecemeal. In New Jersey, we have dealt with the individual, the family and the community. Congress wants to put a cap on benefits for children born to a welfare family, but they don't want to provide a chance for the family to work to earn extra money.</p>
        <p>In America, if you decide to enlarge your family, you'll work another job or work overtime to pay for it. It's a welfare recipient's right to choose to have more children, and the public should not pay extra money for that. But they should be allowed to work extra to earn money for that child.</p>
        <p>Q. The Federal bill would continue to reduce the welfare grant for women who marry, whether the man is the natural father of their children or not. Why do you feel this is wrong?  A. What this says to the welfare mother and to the community is that marriage is bad. A couple would be economically worse off if they form a traditional family. This flies in the face of Republican rhetoric.</p>
        <p>Q. How does the Federal bill compare with New Jersey's law in terms of providing money and incentives for welfare recipients to enroll in school or job training, and what does this difference mean to people on welfare?</p>
        <p>A. The Federal bill reduces money for education and job training, which are a cornerstone of the New Jersey law. They seem to feel that people on welfare should somehow just get off, and that despite their lack of skills and education, they will be able to get jobs. It won't happen.</p>
        <p>If they get job training and education, they will become taxpaying citizens. In Camden County alone, there are 1,100 welfare mothers in county college, with one-third of them on the dean's list, because of our reforms.</p>
        <p>Our welfare recipients sign a contract where their benefits are dependent upon their fulfilling their part of the agreement to get an education or job training or whatever fits that individual's needs.</p>
        <p>Q. What will happen to the changes made in New Jersey if the Federal law has different provisions?</p>
        <p>A. It's not clear, but we could lose a lot of our reforms.</p>
        <p>Q. If the system needs to be fixed, isn't some kind of change better than the status quo?</p>
        <p>A. Welfare is bankrupt in this country. But if you just get people off welfare and keep them in poverty, they will appear in the system in other, more expensive, ways -- as the homeless, as sick people in hospitals, or as prisoners in the jails.</p>
        <p>I oppose the Federal law because it is not the way America works. New Jersey's law is humane, but it is also based on the marketplace. We have to show people it is in their economic interest to provide education and job training for welfare recipients, and we have to set realistic goals for welfare recipients. I told President Clinton his five-year cutoff for benefits is wrong because sometimes you can't make the transition to full work in that time. Each case is individual.</p>
        <p>We can make the transition from poverty to working society a casual walk across the street, as opposed to making it a mountain people have to climb.  GOVERNMENT</p>
