        <p>I happen to be an octogenarian who is blessed with children who, along with  their spouses, are always there for me. My grandson and his wonderful bride virtually dote on me. But if you took my cat away, I would be bereft. He gives me a kind of affection and companionship that is totally unique, something that  Mr. Lipsyte clearly has never known. I pity him.</p>
