        <p>HALLOWEEN DOINGS</p>
        <p>Three of the sites maintained by Historic Hudson Valley have organized Halloween extravaganzas for all ages next weekend, based on the doings and characters in Washington Irving's "Legend of Sleepy Hollow."</p>
        <p>On Friday and Saturday from 6 to 9 P.M., Philipsburg Manor and its grounds in North Tarrytown will be lighted with candles and bonfires, ideal for viewing  the Headless Horseman astride a black stallion in the meadow. A variety of ghouls and witches will beckon from the paths, and inside the barn, illuminated  only with candle lanterns, visitors may sit among bales of hay and pumpkins while listening to costumed storytellers and 19th-century music.</p>
        <p>Young children may prefer to visit from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. both days when the  accent is not on haunting but on pumpkin carving, mask making, open-hearth cooking, observing the grist mill in operation and spending time with the farm animals.</p>
        <p>Two film versions of "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" will be screened during the day, and across the street the Old Dutch Church and its ancient graveyard, through which Ichabod Crane was chased by the Headless Horseman and where Washington Irving is buried, will be open to visitors.</p>
        <p>Sunnyside, Irving's home in Tarrytown, will be open from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. next Saturday and Sunday with storytelling, shadow puppets, woodland walks and video presentations of the author's stories. Also offered will be open-hearth cooking demonstrations in the kitchen, a fiddler in the parlor and picnic tables outdoors for lunching on food brought from home or bought on the premises.</p>
        <p>On Saturday evening Sunnyside will be given over to adults. From 7 to 8 P.M.  Ben Cheever will read a chilling work by his father, John Cheever, and Ray Bowles, who is president of the Tarrytown Music Hall Theater, will describe "sightings" of the Headless Horseman over the years.</p>
        <p>Candlelight tours of the house and grounds will be available from 6 to 7 P.M. and again following the reading and wine reception. Cost of the evening will be  $15 by advance reservation only. Call 631-8200, extension 618.</p>
        <p>Finally, Van Cortlandt Manor in Croton-on-Hudson will be host to a Harvest Ball in a tent on Saturday from 6 to 9 P.M. Costumed "guests" of the Van Tassel  family will perform country dances to music of the period, children will bob for apples, stories and fortunes will be told and the house will be open for candlelighted tours.</p>
        <p>Admission to each of the three sites (choice of day or evening at Philipsburg Manor) will be $8 for adults, $6 for people 65 and older, $4 for children 6 through 17, free under 6. For directions, reservations or more information, call 631-8200, extension 618.</p>
        <p>INDIAN PAINTINGS</p>
        <p>Some unexpectedly winsome paintings by an American Indian are to be seen at  Sunrise Southwest Gallery in Katonah today only, from 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.</p>
        <p>Delicate watercolors that take the Indian theme many steps beyond the literal art produced by most native painters are infused with humor and grace. Ed Defender, a full-blooded Standing Rock Sioux from Albuquerque, N.M., is the artist, and he will be on hand for the exhibition.</p>
        <p>Prices range from $2,000 to $4,000 for the paintings, and in the hundreds for prints. The gallery is at 27 Katonah Avenue and the phone number is 232-2652.</p>
        <p>TREES FOR THE ASKING</p>
        <p>Anyone who would like a free black cherry, sweet gum, oak or crab apple tree, a viburnum or a number of other small or seedling-size shrubs and trees may dig them up next Saturday and Sunday from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. at the Marshlands Conservancy in Rye.</p>
        <p>Keepers of the grounds are permitting the dig to help maintain a meadow habitat, which is threatened with being overrun by trees and shrubs that could turn it into a forest. Bring your own pick, shovel, burlap and work gloves as none will be provided. The conservancy is on the Post Road (Route 1) just south  of the Rye Golf Club. Call 835-4466 for more information.</p>
        <p>HALLOWEEN MUSICAL</p>
        <p>"The Witch Who Was Afraid of Witches," Alice Low's Halloween book for children, was first published by Pantheon Books in 1978. Now in its seventh edition in the United States, Japan, England and Canada, it will be performed as a musical from Friday through Tuesday at the Emelin Theater in Mamaroneck. Ms. Low adapted the script and lyrics from her own book, and Jacob Stern, composer of numerous film and television scores, plus symphonic and piano music that won  him awards in Europe and the United States, composed the music.</p>
        <p>The heroine is Wendy, the youngest and weakest witch in the family, who overcomes her fear of her powerful and mean-spirited sisters by outwitching them.</p>
        <p>Performances are at 7 P.M. on Friday, Monday and Tuesday, 11 A.M. and 2 P.M.  on Saturday and 2 P.M. on Sunday. Tickets are $7 to $10. The theater is on Library Lane, just off the Post Road. Call 698-0098 for tickets or more information.</p>
        <p>AWARD-WINNING POET</p>
        <p>This year's Fellowship Award-winner in poetry from the National Endowment for the Arts will read from his works at the Creative Arts Cafe in Mount Kisco on Wednesday at 7:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Known only as D. Nurske, he is familiar to poets and poetry buffs as the author of several highly respected books of poems and as a translator, editor and winner of many awards from 1986 through 1990, including the National Poetry  Series, the Wesleyan Younger Poets Award and the Whiting Writers Award.</p>
        <p>His works are included in many anthologies from 1986 through 1991, and his most recent solo volume of poetry is "Voices Over Water," published in 1993 by Greywolf Press in St. Paul. Among his PBS-TV readings was a segment of "Poetry Breaks," filmed at WGBH-TV, Boston, last year.</p>
        <p>The Creative Arts Cafe is part of the Northern Westchester Center for the Arts at 272 North Bedford Road (Route 117). Admission will be by suggested donation of $3. For more information, call 241-6922.</p>
        <p>MORE FOR HALLOWEEN</p>
        <p>A tour of the burial ground at St. Paul's Church National Historic Site in Mount Vernon, in continuous use since 1665, will begin at 2 P.M. today. The burial ground is undergoing a program of research and restoration, which is providing information about the city's early inhabitants.</p>
        <p>The tour is one of the Halloween events taking place from 1 to 4 P.M. on the  church grounds, at 897 South Columbus Avenue. Fred Greenspan and his Punch and Judy Show will perform at 1 and 2 P.M., and Nicola and Rufus James will tell stories at 1:30 and 2:30 P.M. At 3 a costume parade will begin on the green with prizes awarded in several categories.</p>
        <p>St. Paul's is the only property in Westchester County that is registered with the National Park Service. Built from 1763 to 1805 in Georgian style, the cemetery holds gravestones from the 18th and 19th centuries, and its adjacent museum contains exhibits relating to local history.</p>
        <p>Admission is free. For more information, call 667-4116.</p>
