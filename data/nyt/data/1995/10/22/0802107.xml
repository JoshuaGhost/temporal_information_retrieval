        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I must take issue with the Oct. 8 article "Fur Trade Wanes, but Its Cradle Finds New Life." In fact the fur industry is not waning; industry sales over the past five years have held steady.</p>
        <p>The article failed to differentiate between the retail and manufacturing sectors. Though the number of manufacturers has declined over the years, the retail industry has remained strong -- particularly in the New York City area, where more furs are sold than any place in the country. Just recently Nordstrom opened a fur salon in its new New York store. Maximilian at Bloomingdale's increased the space allotted its fur salon, and J. Mendel at Elizabeth Arden just opened a salon on Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>While the New York fur manufacturing market has declined, overseas fur manufacturing sectors have flourished, from Montreal to Hong Kong and now China. Imports can hurt domestic manufacturers, but consumer interest is quite healthy. CAROL A. WYNNE  Washington, D.C. The writer is executive director of the Fur Information Council of America.</p>
