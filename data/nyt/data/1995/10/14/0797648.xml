        <p>The American President Companies said today that John M. Lillie had resigned  as its chairman and chief executive, citing "differences with the board of directors regarding management issues."</p>
        <p>The company's president, Timothy J. Rhein, will become chief executive in place of Mr. Lillie, who held the post for five years. George Hayashi, president of the company's American President Lines shipping line, becomes chairman.</p>
        <p>The board and John came to the conclusion that the company needed new direction at this time," said a statement attributed to an American President director, F. Warren Hellman. Mr. Hellman did not detail the extent of the differences.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhein, who became president and chief operating officer in July 1995, has many years of operating and industry experience, while Mr. Hayashi is "particularly knowledgeable" about the company's Asia operations, the statement  said.</p>
        <p>American President also announced a jump in third-quarter profits to $30.9 million, or 97 cents a share, from $22.5 million, or 70 cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. Revenue rose to $711 million from $672 million.</p>
        <p>The latest quarter included a pretax gain of $3.6 million from the sale of a  vessel and vessel construction contracts, as well as $3.5 million in liquidated damages resulting from the delayed delivery of two of its new C11-class container ships.</p>
        <p>American President's share price gained $2, to $25.50, on the New York Stock  Exchange.</p>
