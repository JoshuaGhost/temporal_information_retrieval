        <p>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company provided more evidence to bolster its civil racketeering case against the Bankers Trust Company in court documents unsealed yesterday, asserting that its losses were part of a pattern of fraudulent activity by the bank.</p>

        <p>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company provided more evidence to bolster its civil racketeering case against the Bankers Trust Company in court documents unsealed yesterday, asserting that its losses were part of a pattern of fraudulent activity by the bank.</p>
        <p>The documents were unsealed by the Federal judge in Cincinnati who three weeks earlier had banned Business Week magazine from publishing an article based on the material.</p>
        <p>Procter sued Bankers Trust last year, asserting that the bank had not adequately disclosed the risks of trades that ultimately cost it $200 million. The trades involved volatile bets on interest rates known as leveraged derivatives, because their value is derived from bond prices.</p>
        <p>The unsealed documents include disclosures of losses from derivatives sold by Bankers Trust at several companies that had not been publicly identified, including a $78.5 million loss that Procter &amp; Gamble asserted had been incurred by Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceutical concern.</p>
        <p>They also include myriad excerpts of taped conversations by Bankers Trust employees referring in a cavalier manner to unknowing risks taken by their clients and the money the traders were making from them.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Federal judge in the case, John Feikens, reaffirmed his order against Business Week, but that action is moot because the documents were unsealed.</p>
        <p>Judge Feikens also released Bankers Trust's response, in which it cited internal Procter &amp; Gamble documents that it contends show that the company understood the risk of the transactions it was taking. The response also said the deals were part of a longstanding portfolio of speculative investments the company maintained to deploy its spare cash. Moreover, the bank contended that some of the lurid comments by traders were taken out of context.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the court accepted the company's motion to expand the case to include charges under the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization act. That law, widely known as RICO, is meant mainly to fight organized crime but also applies to patterns of criminal activity by other organizations.</p>
        <p>"P.&amp; G. was but one of a series of companies lied to, exploited and cheated by" Bankers Trust, Procter &amp; Gamble said in its court papers. The bank, it said, "engaged in longstanding, massive and intentional patterns of fraud."</p>
        <p>To make its case, Procter identified eight other companies that had lost money as a result of leveraged derivatives sold by Bankers Trust. The losses at five of those had already been made public. In addition to Sandoz, the Procter &amp; Gamble documents said, Sequa, a New York manufacturing concern, lost $7.5 million, and Jefferson Smurfit, an Irish packaging company, lost in excess of $2.4 million. Officials at Sandoz, Jefferson Smurfit and Sequa could not be reached for comment last night. A Bankers Trust spokesman declined to comment on these cases, citing client confidentiality.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble's own loss involved two transactions, one in October 1993 and another in February 1994. Each transaction involved an attempt by Procter &amp; Gamble to borrow money at a rate below what it would normally pay by adding an element of further risk. Specifically, Procter would gain its advantageous rate if overall interest rates stayed stable or fell, but it would lose if rates increased. Bankers Trust told the company, however, that it could limit its losses by closing out the transaction at any time.</p>
        <p>The dispute centers on how well Bankers Trust disclosed the nature of the risky elements of the transaction.</p>
        <p>Procter's documents quote tapes of a series of telephone conversations between Kevin Hudson, the Bankers Trust salesman responsible for Procter &amp; Gamble, speaking to Alison Bernhard, another trader at Bankers Trust, who was also his fiancee.</p>
        <p>After completing the first contract with P.&amp; G., Mr. Hudson told Ms. Bernhard that the deal was leveraged -- that is, the gains or losses would be magnified -- by 17 times. Ms. Bernhard asked whether the company understood the trade.</p>
        <p>"They understand what they did, but they don't understand the leverage," Mr. Hudson responded.</p>
        <p>Later, after rates began to rise, Mr. Hudson told Ms. Bernhard that P.&amp; G had lost $17 million on one trade.</p>
        <p>"Are they dying?" she asked.</p>
        <p>"They don't know," he replied, noting that the company had never asked about their loss.</p>
        <p>"God help you if they do," his fiancee told him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hudson replied that he hoped to get another trade with Procter completed first. "Then they can ask," he said.</p>
        <p>At another point, Mr. Hudson boasts of modifying the terms of one of the deals in a way that "was worth a million to them, two million to me." The court documents say that in 1993, Mr. Hudson was paid a bonus of $1.325 million on top of his salary of $125,000.</p>
        <p>Douglas Kidd, a Bankers Trust spokesman, described the statements of Mr. Hudson and others quoted in the court documents as "irresponsible and regrettable." But he argued these comments were made within the bank, and that the comments between Mr. Hudson and Procter were legitimate.</p>
        <p>Late last year, Bankers Trust removed Mr. Hudson from his normal duties, pending an investigation, and assigned him a consulting role in London. Ms. Bernhard, to whom he is now married, is a trader in the bank's London office.</p>
        <p>Also in the documents unsealed yesterday, Bankers Trust argued that Procter &amp; Gamble was a sophisticated player in the capital markets, with a $3.8 billion portfolio of derivatives and a further $1.5 billion of investments in "arbitrage positions." It said that the company had entered into earlier transactions with Bankers Trust with 20-fold leverage on which it made money.</p>
        <p>To make its case that P.&amp; G. understood the risk of the transaction in October 1993, Bankers Trust offered a transcript of a conversation in which Mr. Hudson explained the nature of the transaction to Dane Parker, a treasury analyst at Procter &amp; Gamble, as a "bet" that rates would not rise for two months.</p>
        <p>"I like that bet," Mr. Parker said.</p>
        <p>In the court papers, Bankers Trust also points to statements by Procter employees that on Feb. 4, 1994, the day the Federal Reserve began to raise interest rates, Bankers Trust notified the company that it had lost $8 million. Three weeks later, Bankers Trust told Procter in writing that the loss had increased to $37 million. Procter chose nonetheless to keep the position rather than reduce its risk.</p>
        <p>The court document also includes notes by Edwin L. Artzt, then the chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, for a presentation to the company's directors, that the company's treasurer and chief financial officer did not exercise adequate controls and did not react to the first signs of the problem promptly.</p>
        <p>If P.&amp; G. succeeds in its case, it would be entitled to triple damages under the RICO statute.</p>
        <p>A Bankers Trust spokesman said, however, that Procter &amp; Gamble had not yet sustained any damage. That company owes the bank about $170 million for the derivatives trades, which it has not yet paid. The initial suit meant to have that debt erased.</p>
