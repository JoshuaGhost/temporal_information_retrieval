        <p>The dollar rose against leading currencies yesterday as traders sought to protect themselves ahead of a meeting of industrial powers that could lead to a  move to bolster the dollar.</p>
        <p>The dollar's rise was helped by comments from a Portuguese central banker.</p>
        <p>The governor of the Bank of Portugal, Antonio de Sousa, said yesterday that  there was a strong chance that concerted intervention on behalf of the dollar could follow this weekend's meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven nations in Washington.</p>
        <p>"People were woken up by that statement and remembered that the usual trading strategy ahead of the G-7 meeting is squaring positions or buying" dollars, said Callum Henderson, a senior analyst at MMS International.</p>
        <p>In April, officials of the Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- announced their support of the dollar and said they would take appropriate actions to defend it. The dollar then had tumbled to its lowest levels since World War II against the Japanese yen and the German mark.</p>
        <p>Since then, the Group of Seven nations, and in particular Germany, the United States and Japan, have worked to bolster the dollar by buying the currency.</p>
        <p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar rose to 101.41 Japanese yen from 100.35 yen on Monday. The dollar rose to 1.4385 marks from 1.4277 marks and to 1.1584 Swiss francs from 1.1504 Swiss francs. The British pound fell to $1.5838 from $1.5901.</p>
        <p>Trading was thin yesterday, with markets in Germany closed for a national holiday commemorating the nation's unification. With German dealers absent to defend the mark, the German currency lost ground against other European currencies and that also weakened the mark against the dollar.</p>
        <p>In other currency trading, the Canadian dollar surged to a 20-month high of 75.34 United States cents after polls indicated that voters in Quebec would reject secession from Canada in an Oct. 30 referendum. Earlier polls had shown voters divided over secession.</p>
        <p>In New York trading, the Canadian dollar settled at 75.26 United States cents, up from 74.73 on Monday. The Canadian dollar has risen 2.2 percent in the last two weeks.</p>
