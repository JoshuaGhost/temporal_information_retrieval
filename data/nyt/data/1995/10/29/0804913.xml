        <p>LAST SPRING, THE BEST-KNOWN fact about the film "Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision" was that it was not "Hoop Dreams," the acclaimed documentary about inner-city basketball players that was widely expected to win the Oscar for best documentary -- until it turned out not even to be nominated. The Oscar went to "Maya Lin" instead.</p>
        <p>Now, "Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision" has a chance of becoming known for itself. A feature-length look at the architect-artist whose most celebrated work is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, the film was little seen last year, despite its Oscar eligibility. But last week it began a nationwide commercial release, starting in Washington, and on Friday it will open in New York and Los Angeles. Its producers, Freida Lee Mock and Terry Sanders, and Ocean Releasing, the distribution company they own, are trusting that Ms. Lin's increasingly high profile, plus the lingering halo of the Oscar, will lift this film out of the limbo in which the overwhelming number of full-length documentaries end up.</p>

The Oscar went to "Maya Lin" instead.</p>
        <p>Now, "Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision" has a chance of becoming known for itself. A feature-length look at the architect-artist whose most celebrated work is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, the film was little seen last year, despite its Oscar eligibility. But last week it began a nationwide commercial release, starting in Washington, and on Friday it will open in New York and Los Angeles. Its producers, Freida Lee Mock and Terry Sanders, and Ocean Releasing, the distribution company they own, are trusting that Ms. Lin's increasingly high profile, plus the lingering halo of the Oscar, will lift this film out of the limbo in which the overwhelming number of full-length documentaries end up.</p>
        <p>Maya Lin would not seem, despite her fame, to be an ideal subject for a documentary. Now 35, she achieved national prominence as a Yale undergraduate in 1981 when her proposed design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial beat out more than 1,400 other entries in a design competition. She is soft-spoken and understated in manner, and like all gifted artists she prefers to have her work speak for itself. Her designs are highly abstract, making the story still harder to tell. What dramatic tension can there be in the story of a quiet woman who makes simple geometric forms in stone?</p>
        <p>There turns out to be plenty, beginning with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial itself. Ms. Lin's design, a V-shaped wall of black granite sliced into the ground, on which has been carved the name of every one of the more than 56,000 Americans who died in Vietnam, ignited deep, even violent opposition when it was first announced, and a movement arose to reject it in favor of a more traditional, less abstract design.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lin, supported by the courageous veterans who sponsored the memorial and never imagined that their quest to find a design would take them to a stark black wall by a young Asian-American woman, held her ground. The memorial was built almost, if not quite, as designed, and it has become one of the iconic pieces of American design of the last generation. It is as moving and awesome and popular a piece of memorial architecture as exists anywhere in the world, and a profound statement about the potential of carefully wrought abstract form to strike a deep, resonant chord through all levels of society.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lin herself is at once serene and powerful, and seems, at first, to be gentle and low-key. Yet film and subject are perfectly matched in that both possess an inner intensity that reveals itself slowly, but decisively.</p>
        <p>"Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision" opens with Ms. Lin sitting at her drafting board; 20 minutes later, archival film from the hearings about the memorial and new film of people visiting it today have pulled viewers deep into the vortex of the Vietnam War, and we are again wrenched emotionally by its pain. Then the movie gently brings us back to the quietude of a contemplative work of Ms. Lin's, the Peace Chapel at Juniata College in Huntingdon, Pa., only to dive back into the pool of historical emotion with the story of Ms. Lin's most important work after the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a 1989 memorial built in Montgomery, Ala., to honor the sacrifices made in the civil rights movement.</p>
        <p>This portion of the film no more tries to tell the whole story of the civil rights struggle than the portion on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial tries to tell the whole story of the war. Yet both of these sections are particularly evocative, for in letting Ms. Lin speak of the thinking behind the making of these two extraordinary monuments, and in showing the responses people have had to them, the film reveals whole layers of history. Ms. Mock, who also wrote and directed the film, has the rare ability among documentary film makers to maintain a sense of respectful distance and emotional engagement at the same time, and her style aligns perfectly with Ms. Lin's way of doing things.</p>
        <p>The film is blessedly free of talking heads, aside from Ms. Lin's own and that of Vincent Scully, the Yale architectural historian who was Ms. Lin's mentor and who manages to view her work with an endearing combination of surprise and admiration. Ms. Lin is uncharacteristically articulate for an artist who speaks most comfortably through abstract form; she actually understands what she is doing and is able to explain it in words that make sense to a lay audience. How many other artists could say, as she does, that "I create places in which to think, without trying to dictate what to think"?</p>
        <p>IN FACT, WHAT COMES through most clearly is her ability to communicate her belief in public art that speaks to the public rather than to a closed circle of artists. She talks about her work in terms of private sadnesses and public rituals, and speaks of the cathartic act of healing that can come from searching for the name of a loved one on the wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and walking up to it, or of hands joining in a circle around the fountainlike granite table of the Civil Rights Memorial.</p>
        <p>In each case, Ms. Lin has given concrete form to a set of social values, and manages to do so in a way that is striking in its grace, its purity and its focus. She comes across in this film as being utterly without cynicism, yet free also of the cloying earnestness of so many believers: she is self-assured without being arrogant, and committed to creating art that is deeply, profoundly connected to the realities of politics and culture.</p>
        <p>All her good intentions would mean little, of course, if she were not as gifted at the making of form as she is at thinking about the meaning of public art. Yet all her work, from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial to her latest project, the undulating landscape of "The Wave Field" at the University of Michigan, dedicated just a few weeks ago (long after this film was finished), demonstrates the sureness of her hand. The proportions of the stones, the finish of the granite, the placement of the lettering, the balancing of different formal elements -- it is things like these, as much as the underlying concepts, that make Maya Lin's work as good as it is, and bring it beyond social commentary, beyond the genre of public monuments, into the realm of true and lasting art.</p>
