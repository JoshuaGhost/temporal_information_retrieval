        <p>When the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and the Infirm announced last year that they were selling the Madonna Residence, their Park Slope nursing home, it  did not take long for potential purchasers to start circling.

        <p>When the Carmelite Sisters for the Aged and the Infirm announced last year that they were selling the Madonna Residence, their Park Slope nursing home, it  did not take long for potential purchasers to start circling. This is prime Brooklyn real estate, after all, on a strip of Prospect Park West -- sometimes called the Gold Coast -- with views of the park and Grand Army Plaza.</p>
        <p>But actually selling the nine-story white building -- originally a hotel for  the Knights of Columbus -- has been a slow process. The last residents didn't move out until a few months ago. And the list of would-be buyers has been growing.</p>
        <p>James V. Hallisey, the lawyer handling the sale for the Carmelites, said he  is entertaining five or six offers for the building from co-op and condominium developers, hospitals and health-care centers. The asking price for the site, he said, is "in the ballpark" of $3.1 million to $4 million.</p>
        <p>Neighbors of the residence have been interested bystanders with little say in the process. But last week they had a chance to speak out -- and they did.</p>
        <p>Among the organizations interested in buying the residence is the New Vistas  Academy, a private school at 2301 Glenwood Road in Flatbush. Its principal, Helene Hamilton, asked Community Board 6 for a letter ofsupport, and the board arranged a public meeting on the issue for Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>More than 75 neighbors showed up including Representative Charles E. Schumer, City Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher and Assemblyman James F. Brennan. The residents strongly expressed their concern that the school would be a noisy neighbor. They also peppered Ms. Hamilton with a variety of questions about the  school.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hamilton told them that the 21-year-old school has 100 students, pre-kindergarten through high school, and average S.A.T. scores between 800 and  900 points.</p>
        <p>In 1992, New Vistas Academy Inc. declared a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. A school spokesman, Harry Moore, said of the bankruptcy: "Everything has been rectified."</p>
