        <p>The Jets are playing their last season in Winnipeg, but no one is certain where the National Hockey League franchise will land after being sold for $68 million.</p>
        <p>Although Minneapolis is a likely choice, the team's buyers want taxpayer help to seal the deal. City and state officials, however, aren't jumping at the chance to pitch in.</p>
        <p>Barry Shenkarow, principal owner of the Jets, said today the team will be bought by the investors Richard Burke of Minneapolis and Steven Gluckstern of New York. The sale is to be closed July 15.</p>
        <p>Burke has been negotiating with city and state officials for help in bringing the team to Minnesota, which has been without an N.H.L. team since the North Stars left in 1993.</p>
        <p>"I got involved with this because my interest was in bringing it here, period," said Burke, a business executive who said he told the N.H.L. that Minneapolis was his first choice.</p>
        <p>He said inquiries from other cities would be referred to the N.H.L. office unless it becomes obvious enough help is not forthcoming in Minnesota. "We aren't talking to anybody else," he said.</p>
        <p>Shenkarow said at a news conference in Winnipeg that he would have delayed the announcement until near the closing date, but the buyers need time to negotiate for public aid.</p>
        <p>The new owners want help persuading Glen Taylor's Minnesota Timberwolves and  Ogden Entertainment Services Inc., the manager of the city-owned Target Center,  to share revenue with a hockey team.</p>
