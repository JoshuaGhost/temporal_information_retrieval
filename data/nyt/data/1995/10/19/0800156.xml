        <p>SOMETIMES design inspiration practically hits you over the head. When Michael Bierut (pronounced Buh-ROOT) was designing a graphic identity for the new Minnesota Children's Museum in St. Paul, which opened this month, he fiddled with the catch phrase "hands-on interactive museum" until it became his visual theme.</p>
        <p>The designer, 38, is a partner at Pentagram, the international design firm. He photographed the hands of what he calls "a mini-rainbow coalition" of 12 local school children, then used the hands, three stories tall and in gestures of exploration and play, to decorate the exterior of the building.</p>
        <p>The building was designed by James/Snow Architects and the Alliance, two Minneapolis firms.</p>
        <p>The expressive hands are also used throughout the museum in whimsical direction signs.</p>
        <p>"In the last decade, designers have tried desperately to make everything very tasteful, with signs as small and subtle as possible," Mr. Bierut said. "Now, we realize there is authentic vitality in boisterous scale."</p>
        <p>Anne L. Bitter, the museum's president, said, "The design signals on the outside what we're about inside." Often it pays to be charmingly disarming.</p>
