        <p>A 22-year-old American medic has been charged with disobeying a lawful order  by refusing to wear the United Nations blue beret and patch.</p>
        <p>The soldier's commanding general will now decide whether Specialist Michael New of Conroe, Tex., will face a court-martial, an Army spokeswoman, Hilda Patton, said today in Heidelberg, Germany.</p>
        <p>Specialist New was to have been sent to Macedonia this month for peacekeeping duties but was transferred to a headquarters brigade in Schweinfurt, Germany, after refusing orders to wear the United Nations insignia. About 540 American soldiers are part of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Macedonia.</p>
        <p>The medic contends he swore allegiance to the United States and not the United Nations when he joined the service. His is the first case of a United States soldier refusing to wear United Nations blue.</p>
        <p>The charges were filed against Specialist New on Tuesday and sent to Maj. Gen. Montgomery C. Meigs, commander of the Third Infantry Division, who is to decide whether to try the medic.</p>
        <p>Army officials in Europe refused comment on what punishment Specialist New could receive if found guilty.</p>
