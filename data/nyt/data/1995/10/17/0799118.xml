        <p>A shootout involving four young men and two security guards on Sunday evening left a 21-year-old man dead and four others wounded at a private apartment complex in Brooklyn, the police said.</p>
        <p>The gunfire erupted just before 7:30 P.M. in a laundry room at 3415 Neptune Avenue, one of six high-rise buildings that make up the Bay Park apartment complex on Coney Island, said Officer Debra Kearns, a police spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>The man killed in the shootout, Carvin Souffrint of Queens, was hit first by a bullet in the jaw inside the laundry room in an attack that the police said might have been revenge for an earlier incident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Souffrint then fled across a courtyard to the main entrance of an adjacent building, where two apartment security guards shot him, Officer Kearns  said. He died later at Coney Island Hospital.</p>
        <p>Bill Stuttig, spokesman for the Grenadier Realty Corporation, which owns the  apartment complex and the security company, Security Plus Service Inc., said Mr. Souffrint "turned around and pointed a gun at the security guards."</p>
        <p>Jack Florival, 21, of 3325 Neptune Avenue, was charged with attempted murder  in connection with the shootout, Officer Kearns said.</p>
        <p>Those injured were Howard Downing, 22, of 3415 Neptune Avenue; Kiwin Peeples, 23, of 205 Franklin Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn; Mr. Florival, and a 39-year-old male bystander whose name was not released, Officer Kearns said.</p>
