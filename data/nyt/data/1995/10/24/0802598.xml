        <p>The stock market slumped yesterday, as both the dollar and bond prices dropped, making stocks relatively less attractive to investors.</p>
        <p>Before trading opened in the United States, overseas stock markets tumbled, so analysts were well prepared for the decline in domestic equities. The DAX index of German stocks fell 2.91 percent, the CAC-40 index of French stocks fell 1.12 percent and the FT-SE index of British stocks slipped six-tenths of 1 percent.</p>
        <p>The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond declined 18/32 , and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.39 percent from 6.36 percent on Friday. Higher bond yields are a negative for stocks, since they increase both corporate and consumer borrowing costs.</p>
        <p>"The stock market opened lackluster and remained lackluster through the session," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president of Fahnestock &amp; Company. "There is concern over the outcome of the battle of the budget, and last week's  buyers became this week's sellers."</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 39.38 points, or eight-tenths of 1 percent, to 4,755.48 -- near its low for the day.</p>
        <p>Among the broader averages, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.40 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to 585.06 and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.61 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent, to 1,036.92.</p>
        <p>There were almost twice as many declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange as advancing ones, with 1,537 lower and 772 higher. Big Board volume was 330.8 million shares, down from 396.7 million shares on Friday.</p>
        <p>Retail stocks were off during the session amid concern about consumer buying  during the coming holiday season. Kmart slipped 3/4, to 9 1/8, after Moody's cut the rating on its long-term debt. Sears, Roebuck and Company fell 7/8, to 35 1/8.</p>
        <p>Paper issues were down, under pressure from a slowing economy. The Union Camp Corporation declined 7/8, to 51 1/4; the International Paper Company dropped 1,  to 36 1/2, and the Weyerhaeuser Company fell 3/4, to 46.</p>
        <p>Some airline companies were weak, as traders cited concern over fare discounts. AMR, the holding company for American Airlines, closed at 64 3/8, down 1/2; Delta Air Lines closed at 65, down 3/4, and Southwest Airlines closed  at 20 3/4, down 3/8.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the technology sector had a pocket of stocks that finished on the upside. International Business Machines gained 3 5/8, to 99, and the Digital Equipment Corporation, which is scheduled to report its earnings today,  advanced 3/4, to 52 1/2. Advanced Micro Devices, which agreed to acquire Nexgen  late last Friday, increased 1 3/8, to 27 1/2, while Nexgen rose 1/2, to 21 3/4.</p>
        <p>Both the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation advanced as Wall Street indicated its belief that fees would not be imposed on the debt and mortgage-backed securities issued by the two companies. Federal National Mortgage closed at 103 7/8, up 7/8, and Federal  Home Loan Mortgage closed at 69 1/2, up 7/8.</p>
        <p>Summit Technology climbed 1 7/8, to 42 1/2, after the company's excimer laser treatment to correct nearsightedness was approved by the Food and Drug Administration. A rival, Visx Inc., whose laser is expected to win approval by next March, was up 1 1/2, to 22 1/2.</p>
