        <p>Before sheer animal-print caftans made their way onto the runways of Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Gucci and Costume National this season, Egg, a shop at 36 Kinnerton Street in London, was making the soft, comfortable caftan a quiet movement in England.</p>
        <p>Hidden in a former dairy in a mews, Egg seemed to have inspired Donna Karan's fall collection. The dress that Egg has sold by the hundreds, including to aristocrats who have worn it in white to weddings, is a simple Indian shape, fitted at the top and generous below. Egg's version, designed by a co-owner, Asha Sarabhai, is pieced together with tiny openwork stitches in rectangular patches and has tiny slashed pockets and buttons at the neck. A cotton one sells for about $240. Egg was opened by Mr. Sarabhai with his partner, Maureen Doherty, as a place for comfortable clothes. And this dress demands absolutely nothing from its wearer.</p>
