        <p>When an ancient and respectable family is reduced to selling its furniture, crockery, paintings and even hunting trophies to pay off its debts, thoughts about the transitory nature of wealth may be evoked. But as Sotheby's began auctioning off the entire contents of a castle owned by the venerable House of Baden here this week, tears of sympathy were perhaps premature.</p>
        <p>Germany may have abolished its principalities in 1918, but the head of this dynasty still carries the august title of His Royal Highness Max Margrave of Baden. More to the point, the family still owns three other castles in western Germany packed with treasures that are not on the block. And after just two days of the 15-day auction, described by Sothe by's as the largest of its kind ever held, the family was already $21.2 million better off.</p>
        <p>Some 6,000 lots comprising more than 25,000 objects from the Grand Ducal Collections of the House of Baden are involved in the auction, and the most valuable item sold so far was an ormolu-mounted tea table made for the Swedish royal family in 1780, which went for $1,040,520. Almost as expensive was an 18th-century porcelain Ludwigsburg Marketplace, known as the "Venetian Carnival," which sold for $960,480.</p>
        <p>Still, the House of Baden, which traces its roots to the 12th century, has heavy debts to pay. Late last year, after a recession compounded by mismanagement of its agricultural, forestry and industrial holdings had left the family $184 million in the red, the 62-year-old Margrave reluctantly decided to  liquidate some assets. The Neues Schloss, the castle that overlooks this delightful spa, seemed the obvious place to start.</p>
        <p>Since 1918, when the House of Baden was stripped of 15 other castles, the Neues Schloss has been used as a warehouse to store the contents of those expropriated castles. And when teams of Sotheby's experts began sifting through  the Neues Schloss early this year, they found it contained important collections of 17th- and 18th-century German furniture, Flemish tapestries, Meissen procelain and myriad art objects.</p>
        <p>The Margrave had hoped to keep the collection intact, and he offered it to the regional Government of Baden-Wurttemberg for what he described as "a special price" of $55.6 million. The Margrave's offer set off a fierce battle inside the region's coalition Government. The conservative Christian Democrats favored buying the collection, but the left-leaning Social Democrats felt exactly the opposite. "Not a penny for the Margrave," became their war cry.</p>
        <p>Finally, in true coalition style, a deal was worked out, with the regional Government agreeing to pay $31.6 million for the pick of the collection, including its most valuable item, a set of five early 16th-century painted altar panels by the German artist Bernhard Strigel, for which the Arts Ministry paid $8.3 million. The Margrave's library was also part of the Government purchase.</p>
        <p>Christoph Graf Douglas, the head of Sotheby's in Germany, who acted as an adviser to the Margrave, said he was glad that the most important objects would  now stay in the region of Baden-Wurttemberg. But from a financial point of view, he added with a laugh, it was "perhaps lucky" that the Government did not buy everything. "In February, we had done a very rough inventory," he said, "but the more we studied the collection, the more it seemed to be worth."</p>
        <p>This evening, after the first two days of the auction, his instinct was proved right: sales had already exceeded the pre-sale estimate of $20 million for the entire auction. To stir interest in the auction, which ends on Oct. 21,  the most valuable items were offered early on, but takings appeared to be averaging about one-third higher than expected.</p>
        <p>The controversy surrounding the sale has in turn helped draw the crowds. During five open days before the auction, more than 23,000 visitors looked over  the collection, which filled four marquees as well as the 105 rooms of the four-floor castle. Some 17,000 copies of the seven-volume catalogue have already been sold. And about 800 people filled a large marquee when the auctioneer, Simon de Pury, invited bids for the first item on Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>Preparing the collection for display, though, was not easy. Glassware and porcelain sets, some still in their original boxes, had to be washed. Delicate tapestries were rolled up in newspapers dating back to the 1850's. And the attic was full of chairs, picture frames and hundreds of stag's heads and antlers, many attached to plaques recording who shot the animals, where and when.</p>
        <p>While museums, dealers and collectors, many of them bidding by telephone, clearly know what items they want, Sotheby's is also counting on selling many fairly worthless paintings, sticks of furniture and even porcelain bedpans simply because of their association with a German royal family. Mr. Douglas said he expected some items to go for 20 percent more than their objective value, thanks to "the royal markup."</p>
        <p>More of a problem is the castle itself. "It's on the market," said Prince Bernhard, the Margrave's 25-year-old son, "but we have no idea of the price. It  will depend on who wants it, what restoration has to be done. Perhaps in the medium term the Government will buy it. Not yet, of course. It's a problem we'll worry about after the auction."</p>
