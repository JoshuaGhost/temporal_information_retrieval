        <p>"Hooking Teen-Age Smokers" (editorial, Oct. 24) could have been better balanced. You report studies of tobacco advertising by cancer researchers, but you do not ask why they were not published in advertising or marketing journals, rather than in medical publications.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Hooking Teen-Age Smokers" (editorial, Oct. 24) could have been better balanced. You report studies of tobacco advertising by cancer researchers, but you do not ask why they were not published in advertising or marketing journals, rather than in medical publications.</p>
        <p>Would you have paid attention to an article on health tips appearing in the  Journal of Marketing? I doubt it.</p>
        <p>You report the same day that marijuana use is increasing among New York State teen-agers. Yet this is a product that is not advertised at all. Would it not have been appropriate to mention this fact in your editorial?</p>
        <p>You failed to report the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada that  declared its tobacco-advertising ban to be unconstitutional. Yet this decision bears on the Food and Drug Administration proposal to severely restrict tobacco  advertising, a move you support.</p>
        <p>The 1991 studies of Joe Camel advertisements that appeared in the Journal of  the American Medical Association have been debunked by at least three reputable  advertising scholars. Yet you keep quoting them as having proved that Joe Camel  is the most popular cartoon figure among young children, when it is not.</p>
