        <p>The baseball season, which could not have started more badly, redeemed itself at the end. The playoffs -- a bit too drawn-out for our tastes -- nevertheless produced magnetic moments. Not the least of these was the series between the New York Yankees and the Seattle Mariners, an unforgettable duel that gave Yankee fans a welcome respite from the tiresome grievances of George Steinbrenner and gave Seattle fans hope that their troubled franchise would stay put.</p>
        <p>At last came the World Series. Behind some extraordinary pitching, including  Tom Glavine's masterpiece in the final game, the Atlanta Braves neutralized Cleveland's powerful hitters to capture a prize they had come so close to winning before. There was justice and symmetry in this. The playoff schedule was so arranged that a mediocre club could have lucked its way into the Series. The  two best teams in baseball actually survived, and the better team won the championship.</p>

        <p>The baseball season, which could not have started more badly, redeemed itself at the end. The playoffs -- a bit too drawn-out for our tastes -- nevertheless produced magnetic moments.

        <p>At last came the World Series. Behind some extraordinary pitching, including  Tom Glavine's masterpiece in the final game, the Atlanta Braves neutralized Cleveland's powerful hitters to capture a prize they had come so close to winning before. There was justice and symmetry in this. The playoff schedule was so arranged that a mediocre club could have lucked its way into the Series. The  two best teams in baseball actually survived, and the better team won the championship.</p>
        <p>The biggest winner, however, may have been baseball itself. The season started late because of a demoralizing labor dispute that began in 1994 and did  not end until April. The fans, furious with both players and owners, stayed home. Yet over the last month there have been enough dramatic nights and enough  packed stadiums to suggest that the game of baseball might well survive the business of baseball -- if only the players and owners will get their heads together. There is still no collective bargaining contract, no real bargaining and no commissioner of baseball. There could well be another strike.</p>
        <p>It is hard to summon great sympathy for either side in a dispute over riches  that most Americans can only dream about. That includes the players, especially  those who charge children $7 for an autograph. In the end, though, the responsibility for stabilizing the sport lies mainly with the owners. The players are justified in fighting for the freedom to sell their skills in an open market. The salary inflation that imperils teams in weaker markets -- teams like the Pittsburgh Pirates, an old and honorable franchise -- was propelled by the owners themselves. If some redistribution of wealth is required to keep these franchises competitive, the owners should finance it.</p>
        <p>For now, let us savor a fine Series and join with the disappointed Cleveland  fans in baseball's most hopeful refrain: Wait till next year. Let us also join with fans everywhere in hoping that there will be a next year.</p>
