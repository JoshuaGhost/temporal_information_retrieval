        <p>The landscape of East New York is still dominated by damage, with decaying buildings pockmarking blocks where murder remains much too frequent. But behind the scars is a vibrant neighborhood, one where children are led by the hand through the streets to school, buildings are rebuilt and gardens are grown where there once was debris.</p>
        <p>The mix of devastation and determination makes East New York ripe for urban experimentation. Enter, then, one of the more unusual sets of lab partners: police officers and professors, residents and corporate executives, housing experts and welfare recipients, all banding together to create the latest model for community policing.</p>
        <p>Starting this week, 20 blocks of East New York will become the laboratory for this effort, benefiting from an intensive deployment of police and other resources. The program will use private money, national and local community development corporations, criminal justice experts from Harvard University and the officers of the 75th Precinct.</p>
        <p>Two sites have been chosen so far for the three-year national pilot program: this area of Brooklyn -- the center of what has long been one of the most murderous neighborhoods in the city -- and Seattle's Chinatown.Projects in three other cities, including Boston and San Diego, are expected to be announced soon.</p>
        <p>"I don't believe East New York is the Wild West anymore," said Rosa Serna, 42, a mother of two who lives there. "And the working people have always been here waiting for change."</p>
        <p>Under what will be known as the Community Security Initiative, to be announced by Police Commissioner William J. Bratton at a news conference today, the 75th Precinct, reorganizing its community policing unit, will assign four officers to the target blocks of East New York. Those officers will be directly supervised by a sergeant, who will have the authority to request any or all of the department's tactical drug and street crime units.</p>
        <p>The precinct's liaison to the neighborhood's residents will be the East New York Urban Youth Corps, a community development corporation that has helped rehabilitate scores of buildings in East New York in the last several years. Using their contacts with tenant organizers and residents, the development corporation will introduce the officers to a network of people willing to provide information on drug dealing and desperate for a relationship with beat officers that goes beyond staring at them as they drive by in a car.</p>
        <p>There will be monthly meetings; committees of residents from each of the 20 blocks will be set up, and professional surveys and polls will be conducted. And all of the data collected will be studied, with refinements proposed, by professors from the criminal justice and management program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.  "This is a long-term commitment, not just about two cops on a corner for a couple of weeks," said Inspector Edward Mezzadri, commanding officer of the 75th Precinct. "This is community policing turned up to the highest possible volume."  The history of community policing in the city has not been sterling. Former Mayor David N. Dinkins initiated his version of the concept -- broadly understood to be a way of fostering working relationships between the police and the residents of individual precincts to prevent crime -- only to have his own officials conclude that the effort had been plagued by flawed strategy, a lack of interest among officers, high turnover rates among community policing officers, and outright dishonesty. Officers were found to have lied about how often they actually walked their beats.</p>
        <p>In East New York, there has been a gap in trust between the residents and the 75th Precinct. For officers, an assignment to work in the 75th Precinct, which two years ago recorded 129 murders over 12 months, was viewed as punishment. There was also corruption among some officers, and plain fear about having to serve in such a troubled area.</p>
        <p>But the 75th Precinct has enjoyed a rebirth of sorts over the last several years. Under the aggressive tactics endorsed by Mr. Bratton, violent crime has fallen by 30 percent across the board in the precinct, with murders down by more than 60 percent over the last two years.</p>
        <p>And while no one in the neighborhood is willing to concede that the police have completely accounted for the drop in crime, there is a sense that the moment is right to reclaim East New York's streets permanently. More than 7,000 units of affordable housing are to be built in the coming years, and more modest rehabilitation efforts are going on along whole blocks of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Program organizers, who have been working with the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, are ambitious enough to be considering having people who plead guilty to buying drugs or soliciting prostitutes work on the block on which they were arrested, during which they would be forced to wear clothing identifying them as having committed a crime in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>To Paul Grogan, the president of the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which has coordinated the investment of millions of dollars in revitalizing East New York and put together the community policing program, the program makes practical financial sense.  Millie Wilkerson, though, doesn't look so deep for rationales. Mrs. Wilkerson, who has lived in East New York for 20 years, knows she wants to feel safe again.  "Who knows why people are doing it or how long it will stick for?"' she said. "But how can it not be worth trying?"</p>
