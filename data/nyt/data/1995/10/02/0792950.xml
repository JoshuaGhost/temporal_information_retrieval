        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Sept. 25 news article on the windstorm that leveled 126,000 acres of trees in New York State's Adirondack Park compared conditions in the park to those in Long Island's pine barrens, where wildfires raged this summer. Using the fire-dependent pine barrens to make a point about fire potential in the Adirondacks is like explaining baseball rules by watching a football game.</p>
        <p>The Adirondacks has not been dubbed the "Asbestos Woods" for nothing. Not since the turn of the century, when clear-cut tracts were occasionally touched off by the burning ash of coal-fired locomotives, has wildfire posed a serious problem.</p>
        <p>The park is blessed with an abundance of water -- in ponds, lakes, bogs, swamps, rivers and streams. Annual precipitation levels in the Adirondacks, particularly in the blowdown region, are the highest in the state. All of this water has a significant damping effect on fire potential. The 400,000-acre blowdown of 1950 resulted in only a handful of small blazes that burned a grand total of some 100 acres.</p>
        <p>Does this mean that we should not be concerned about fire? Absolutely not. Especially if the next three years are as dry as this year has been. But fear of wildfire must not be used as an excuse to compromise the State Constitution by allowing the unnecessary, unlawful removal of timber on public forest preserve lands.</p>
        <p>In these "forever wild" areas nature must be allowed to run its course. State officials must do everything possible to quell unfounded fears about the danger of wildfire in the Adirondacks by keeping the public informed. ERIC J. SIY Adirondack Project Director Environmental Advocates Albany, Sept. 26, 1995</p>
