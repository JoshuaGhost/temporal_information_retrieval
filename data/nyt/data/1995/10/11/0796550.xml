        <p>The dollar ended little changed yesterday, giving up gains in Europe after stocks fell for a second consecutive day in the United States and fresh concerns arose over Mexico's economic health.</p>
        <p>The currency made modest progress in Europe overnight against the German mark as the mark's rally against the French franc stalled. But a lack of follow-through buying in New York caused the dollar to retest the day's lows.</p>
        <p>Traders expect tight dollar ranges to continue. "The dollar remains in a choppy range and we expect more of the same this week," said Philip Vasan, managing director for foreign-exchange derivatives at CS First Boston.</p>
        <p>Weakness in the stock market also put pressure on the dollar, as the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted in early trading after falling 42.99 points on Monday.</p>
        <p>In New York trading late yesterday, the dollar rose to 100.88 Japanese yen from 100.43 yen on Monday. It rose to 1.4184 marks from 1.4124 and to 1.1485 Swiss francs from 1.1425 Swiss francs.</p>
        <p>The Mexican peso unnerved dollar holders yesterday as the peso fell as much as 4.2 percent. The collapse of the peso last winter had dragged down the dollar because of the close economic ties between the United States and Mexico.</p>
        <p>But Mexican financial weakness is not as threatening to the dollar as it was  last winter, according to some traders, including Mr. Vasan of CS First Boston,  who said, "Overseas holdings of Mexican assets are not as large as they used to be."</p>
        <p>The peso settled at 6.7450 to the dollar yesterday, weaker than the rate of 6.6500 to the dollar late Monday.</p>
        <p>The reversal of the mark's sharp climb against the French franc helped support the dollar versus the mark overnight, traders said. The mark rose sharply against the franc on Monday before an increase in French short-term interest rates halted the franc's slide.</p>
        <p>"We saw some selling of marks in Europe, and that gave a lift to the dollar," said Paul Farrell, managing director for foreign exchange at Chase Manhattan Bank.</p>
        <p>The dollar traded as high as 1.4231 marks before retreating.</p>
        <p>Currency traders remain wary that central banks will buy dollars in support of a call for a stronger dollar made over the weekend by the Group of Seven industrial nations.</p>
