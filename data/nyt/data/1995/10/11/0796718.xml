        <p>SHORTLY after practice yesterday morning, Ed O'Bannon, the Nets rookie forward, headed to the cafeteria for lunch. He was in the middle of a conversation when someone playfully interrupted: it was Scotty Thurman. The two exchanged greetings, and Thurman hurried ahead.</p>
        <p>Six months ago, they were bitter rivals in the national collegiate championship game in Seattle. O'Bannon played for U.C.L.A. and Thurman for Arkansas, the defending champion.</p>
        <p>O'Bannon had been in orbit that night as he had been all season. He could not, would not be stopped. He scored 30 points and grabbed 17 rebounds as U.C.L.A. won its first national championship in 20 years.</p>
        <p>"We used to kid each other about the game, about the season," O'Bannon recalled. "That was then, this is now. Life goes on."</p>
        <p>Six months later, they meet again, in Kutztown. Thurman is trying to make the Nets as a free agent. O'Bannon, the Nets' first-round draft pick, is being counted on heavily to make the team better -- sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>Butch Beard, the Nets' head coach, said O'Bannon could provide the sort of positive presence any successful team needs. Especially when the team is the Nets, with no recent winning tradition and no focus to speak of.</p>
        <p>The team currently bears the signature of Derrick Coleman, the talented power forward. Coleman, with his mercurial moods, is simultaneously the team's greatest hope and its greatest obstacle.</p>
        <p>O'Bannon is the first player the Nets have drafted in some time with enough talent, character and commitment to winning to counter Coleman's individualized approach.</p>
        <p>"He's a very special player and a special young man," Beard said of O'Bannon. "Once he finds out what the league is about, he's going to be something else."</p>
        <p>The Nets desperately want their prized rookie to do well.</p>
        <p>What stood out about O'Bannon during the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament was the confidence he projected and his sense of being centered. He was the Bruins' leader more with his presence and well-chosen words. He preached the gospel of teamwork and togetherness, of family and faith.</p>
        <p>Six months later, O'Bannon's faith, character and stamina are about to be severely tested: he's a New Jersey Net. He has gone from the nation's best college basketball team to one of the National Basketball Association's worst.</p>
        <p>Slowly, he's beginning to understand the dynamics of the team that drafted him.</p>
        <p>"Last year we played with a team presence," O'Bannon recalled. "We had faith -- faith in the Lord, faith in each other, faith in the program and in the coach. It was a nice feeling and it got inside of you. Now I'm on my own, in a different part of the country on a team where they really didn't have that experience. Takes time."</p>
        <p>He must walk a tightrope and walk on eggshells. He said that he has not spoken with Coleman or Kenny Anderson about setting a new tone for the team. That's for another day.</p>
        <p>"I'm the youngest," he said. "I haven't come here to save lives. I just want to win."</p>
        <p>First he must eradicate the troublesome perception that he is damaged goods. In October 1990, O'Bannon tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee. He missed his freshman season and 10 games of his sophomore season.</p>
        <p>His dazzling performance last April in the Final Four completed an all-consuming rehabilitation effort that erased -- in O'Bannon's mind -- any doubts.</p>
        <p>But doubts persist. He missed most of yesterday morning's workout with soreness in the left knee and spent the evening session on a stationary bike. Asked about the knee after practice, the usually upbeat O'Bannon curtly explained that his knee has been sore before and that soreness is the norm for anyone who has had arthroscopic knee surgery.</p>
        <p>"The people out West who saw me every day, who saw the little games where I struggled and got better, know that I'm back." O'Bannon said. "But now I'm on the East Coast, and I feel that I've got to prove myself all over again. In a way, I'm excited about it. Some guys go to the pro level and lose their fire. This is just another challenge for me. I've got to fight."</p>
        <p>U.C.L.A. lost two games last season in a 33-game schedule. The Nets lost 52 games in an 82-game schedule. If the Nets miraculously reach the playoffs and advance, O'Bannon could play more than 100 games.</p>
        <p>"That's what I'm here for," he said. "I'm not here to impose myself on anybody. I just want to run hard, throw good passes, rebound. I just want to fit in."</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the Nets will need more than that.</p>
