        <p>All three of the works in "Avant-Garde Visions," the New York Film Festival's annual program of experimental films, screened this evening at 6 at Alice Tully  Hall, are pictorial studies that contemplate their subjects from a careful esthetic distance.</p>
        <p>"River Colors," the longest, is a leisurely panoramic tour of houseboats along a river in Thailand photographed in such a way that you're not sure of what you're seeing. The most striking aspect of the film, which was shot by Vom  Fluss, a German director, is the illusion that it is all one continuous camera movement. In fact, the film is a series of long, slow takes dissolved together so seamlessly that you hardly notice when one shot ends and another begins, or even when the camera reverses direction.</p>

        <p>All three of the works in "Avant-Garde Visions," the New York Film Festival's annual program of experimental films, screened this evening at 6 at Alice Tully  Hall, are pictorial studies that contemplate their subjects from a careful esthetic distance.</p>
        <p>"River Colors," the longest, is a leisurely panoramic tour of houseboats along a river in Thailand photographed in such a way that you're not sure of what you're seeing. The most striking aspect of the film, which was shot by Vom  Fluss, a German director, is the illusion that it is all one continuous camera movement. In fact, the film is a series of long, slow takes dissolved together so seamlessly that you hardly notice when one shot ends and another begins, or even when the camera reverses direction.</p>
        <p>Floating by these crumbling, peeling river dwellings packed with people of all ages, their possessions and a fair number of dogs, the camera records an impressionistic blur of sights and sounds. As radios and televisions blare, babies cry and a thundershower arrives and subsides, the people, their boats and the river become ingredients of a shifting, rippling cinematic landscape. Life goes on, simultaneously chaotic and serene.</p>
        <p>Where "River Colors" is lulling and often caressingly beautiful, "Zone," by Takashi Ito, a Japanese film maker, is an exercise in mounting tension and surreal imagery. A miniature white electric train on a figure-eight track speeds up until it is a madly whirling streak of light. Among a group of pictures on a  wall, one after another turns into a film. The sand in an hourglass pours at an  alarming rate. A white-faced, mummylike figure stirs ominously. These and other mysterious happenings accelerate into a display of cinematic fireworks that is as visually spectacular as the technology behind it is unfathomable.</p>
        <p>The third entry, Matthias Muller's film "Alpsee," studies the tensions between a woman and her little boy, who live in an immaculate modern house. The  most arresting image is the mother's pouring her son an endless glass of milk that spills out over the kitchen table and floods their home.</p>
        <p>These three elegant films certainly qualify as avant-garde, but in a rather timid way. Work that is rawer, rangier and more adventurous is being shown in the Fourth New York Video Festival, which continues through Saturday at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.</p>
