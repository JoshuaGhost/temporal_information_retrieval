        <p>As Congress today considers some of the most severe anti-immigration measures since the 1920's, it is facing resistance from a surprising alliance of high-technology manufacturers, religious leaders, conservative think tanks, civil liberties organizations and tiny, grass-roots immigrant groups.</p>
        <p>From Microsoft, which is fighting limitations on visas for foreign computer scientists, to the Roman Catholic Church, which is battling for the rights of political refugees, the coalition is giving some heft to the loosely organized opposition by immigrants, who belatedly realized that the mood of the country had turned against them.</p>
        <p>"There's a wide array of groups that think the legal immigration system is not broken and doesn't need radical changes," said Ira Rubinstein, a senior lawyer for Microsoft.</p>
        <p>It is a loose alliance, and each group has its own concerns with the Omnibus Immigration Bill, which is to be taken up by the House Judiciary Committee today, as well as with similar proposals in the Senate. In New York City, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has sided with the proposal's opponents and against many Republican leaders nationally.</p>
        <p>The diversity of the opposition reflects the broad sweep of the various Congressional proposals, which began as an attack on illegal immigration and were broadened to restrict legal immigration as well.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers, insistent that they need foreigners with special skills to remain competitive, oppose attempts to limit visas used by United States companies to hire foreign engineers, computer programmers and scientists. Ethnic groups in cities across the country denounce a proposal that would cut the annual level of legal immigration by 30 percent and restrict their rights to bring their foreign relatives here. Church organizations and immigration lawyers oppose pending cuts in the number of refugees and the rights of people seeking political asylum.</p>
        <p>And a proposed national computer system to enable employers to check the legal status of prospective workers has drawn opposition both from civil liberties groups, who fear it would lead to discrimination, and from anti-regulation libertarians and business groups, who see it as an expensive and invasive growth of government.</p>
        <p>"Most of these groups have never worked together before," said Rick Swartz, a lawyer who started the National Immigration Forum and is instrumental in the current coalition. "Some of them may have found this difficult to imagine a year ago."</p>
        <p>These groups do not speak with a single voice, nor do they have a single agenda. But the cumulative effect of their activities is expanding what was a one-sided debate about how immigrants are draining the American economy to include at least some emphasis on the role of immigrants in helping the country stay competitive in the global economy and in restoring forgotten inner-city neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>While it is unclear whether they are having any impact beyond that, the opponents of the new restrictions seem to have pushed the Judiciary Committee to consider splitting the omnibus bill into two, one focusing on illegal immigration and the other on legal.</p>
        <p>Representatives have been lobbied from all sides. Both the Massachusetts Immigration and Refugee Advocacy Coalition and Reebok International, the shoe company, have lobbied Representative Barney Frank, a Democrat of Massachusetts who serves on the Judiciary Committee. The National Association of Manufacturers, Intel and the Cato Institute, a conservative study group in Washington, have lobbied Representative Lamar Smith, a Republican of Texas whose legislation contains the strong restrictions.</p>
        <p>The most interesting union is between traditionally liberal immigration groups and pro-growth, free-trade conservative organizations, which defend immigration as a matter of principle and espouse the virtues of most immigrants. They have always agreed on the benefits of immigration, but rarely allied themselves publicly.</p>
        <p>Steve Moore, an economist with the Cato Institute, called the restrictive proposals "anti-business, anti-family, anti-freedom."</p>
        <p>And Luis A. Miranda Jr., the president of the Hispanic Federation of New York, said, "Unless we begin to educate the general public that immigrants don't make the cities and country worse, people see lack of employment, lack of opportunity and think we should close the door."</p>
        <p>In June, President Clinton endorsed a recommendation of the Federal Commission on Immigration Reform to cut legal immigration by one-third. Dick Day, the chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, said the alliance fighting the proposals was "Washington groups and on the other side are the American people" who have asked for "some breathing space" from immigration. The subcommittee is led by Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican of Wyoming who is a chief proponent of the restrictive measures.</p>
        <p>Representative Smith has said that opponents have overstated his bill's effect on both family members and skilled workers and that he was responding to a national consensus that legal immigration should be reformed.</p>
        <p>John L. Martin, the research director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports the restrictive measures, said the opponents were "the very liberal element that is in favor of diversity in the country, business interests that benefit from a free flow of labor and people who simply don't like big government." He said the lobbying had led some members of Congress "to water down some of the proposals."</p>
        <p>Opposition to the proposals has just recently been organized, two years after the anti-immigration movement began gathering steam behind California's Proposition 187, which bars illegal immigrants from public education and other benefits. California voters approved it overwhelmingly in November 1994.</p>
        <p>"I think we are at the beginning of a pretty ferocious debate about the role of immigrants: Do we still want to be a nation of immigrants or do we want to throw up the walls and say 'No More'?" asked Frank Sharry, the executive director of the National Immigration Forum.</p>
        <p>Pope John Paul II, during his United States visit last week, warned of the threats to the country's tradition of welcoming immigrants, a theme already sounded by the National Council of Catholic Bishops.</p>
        <p>The anti-immigrant sentiment has created a sense of siege among immigrants, unifying ethnic groups that often exist in parallel worlds and stirring political activity in organizations initially established to serve the more basic housing and economic needs of immigrants.</p>
        <p>"If you're a new immigrant, you're trying to hold down three or four jobs and get your kids in school," said Marjie McHugh, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. "There has not been time for political organizing. But because of what's been going on nationally in terms of the debate, it's speeding up that process."</p>
        <p>The strength of the activism by immigrants and business leaders was demonstrated last month when, on one day, about 300 immigrants went to Washington to lobby members of Congress against restricting the immigration of family members. The next day, representatives of 65 companies organized by the National Association of Manufacturers and the American Immigration Lawyers Association showed up to make similar arguments against imposing restrictions on visas for skilled and professional workers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubinstein, of Microsoft, disputed the contention that foreign workers were taking corporate jobs from Americans. He said that 25 percent of the job openings his company had last year -- about 1,000 positions -- remained vacant because qualified people could not be found, either here or abroad.</p>
        <p>Last month, the National Immigration Forum held a series of news conferences in major cities to release a study titled "Together In Our Differences," profiling immigrant enterprises working to rebuild poor city neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>The strong presence of business has added a new dimension to the issue, said Austin T. Fragomen, a New York lawyer who represents such companies as I.B.M., Procter &amp; Gamble and Walt Disney. All three are concerned about how the proposals would restrict their freedom to hire foreign workers for jobs in the United States.</p>
        <p>"When Congressmen think of immigration, they typically think of the Polish-American Alliance coming to beat up on them," Mr. Fragomen said. "They never had any idea business was interested in immigration."</p>
