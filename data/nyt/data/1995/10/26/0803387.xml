        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says he was motivated by principle and a long memory, rather than politics, in ejecting Yasir Arafat from a celebratory concert on Monday night, and his passion on the subject is clearly deeply held.  But just as previous mayors have found, Mr. Giuliani's ventures into foreign policy dovetail quite nicely with his political needs in a city that is really a collection of ethnic principalities.</p>
        <p>The United States State Department may not have appreciated the treatment accorded to the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization at Lincoln Center, but many of the more politically conservative Jewish voters in the city  did. Dozens of mostly Orthodox Jewish leaders and elected officials turned out for a mini-rally on the City Hall steps yesterday to praise the Mayor's action,  and the Mayor's office said it received more than 1,000 phone calls of support.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani says he was motivated by principle and a long memory, rather than politics, in ejecting Yasir Arafat from a celebratory concert on Monday night, and his passion on the subject is clearly deeply held.  But just as previous mayors have found, Mr. Giuliani's ventures into foreign policy dovetail quite nicely with his political needs in a city that is really a collection of ethnic principalities.</p>
        <p>The United States State Department may not have appreciated the treatment accorded to the chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization at Lincoln Center, but many of the more politically conservative Jewish voters in the city  did. Dozens of mostly Orthodox Jewish leaders and elected officials turned out for a mini-rally on the City Hall steps yesterday to praise the Mayor's action,  and the Mayor's office said it received more than 1,000 phone calls of support.</p>
        <p>We will not forget the courage you have displayed these last few days," Dov Hikind, a Democratic state assemblyman from Brooklyn, said.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Giuliani's repeated denunciations last week of Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, seemed aimed at least in part at the significant bloc of conservative Hispanic voters that he needs to keep in his camp. Mr. Castro's presence in the city for the 50th anniversary of the United Nations had not been much of an issue until Mr. Giuliani began condemning him as a torturer, and to make certain the matter received publicity, the Mayor's aides urged reporters to ask him about Mr. Castro at his daily news conferences.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said that Mr. Arafat's past as a terrorist outweighed his present as a peacemaker. But no such bitterness was on display last September when Gerry Adams -- once imprisoned by the British as a terrorist but now embarked on the road to peace in Northern Ireland -- paid an official visit to City Hall. In a clear nod to the thousands of sympathetic Irish voters in New York, the Mayor presented Mr. Adams, the head of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, with the crystal apple accorded to foreign dignitaries. No mention was made of the fact that Mr. Adams had served the year before as a pallbearer for an I.R.A. member who died when the bomb he was carrying exploded  prematurely, killing 10 people.</p>
        <p>Many of those who took issue with the ejection of Mr. Arafat, including former Mayor Edward I. Koch, also argued that it was not politically smart because a majority of Jews, not to mention of all voters, support the Middle East peace process. In an unusual news conference yesterday, Mr. Koch and former Mayor David N. Dinkins -- hardly political allies -- teamed up to blast the Arafat incident in the strongest terms.</p>
        <p>But both men, and particularly Mr. Koch, regularly succumbed to the political need to have an outspoken foreign policy. In fact, there is nothing new about a  New York City mayor muddying diplomatic waters, even if few have done so as dramatically and as brashly as Mr. Giuliani did on Monday night. Just as Fiorello H. La Guardia denounced Hitler, and as Mr. Koch embarrassed President Jimmy Carter by criticizing his policy on Israel, Mr. Giuliani found it useful to appeal to a passionate interest of one of his constituencies.</p>
        <p>"It's a long and noble tradition of New York City mayors to exercise independent foreign policy judgments," said Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center and a top aide to Mayors Koch, Dinkins and John V. Lindsay. "It goes with the turf. The city has the world's most diverse population, and the people of New York expect the Mayor to represent their interests."</p>
        <p>Voters outside the city might have different expectations, of course, and the Mayor may not have done himself any favors if he ever intends to run for higher  office. Polls have shown that an overwhelming majority of the American people and of American Jews support the peace process. Those percentages are probably even larger than they are in New York, which has the country's largest bloc of Orthodox Jews.</p>
        <p>There was a particular fire in Mr. Giuliani's eyes yesterday as he rejected the notion that he might be at least in part motivated by political considerations, an idea he attributed to cynicism.</p>
        <p>"I think maybe it's difficult for people to come to the conclusion nowadays that maybe somebody in public office would do something out of principle rather than whether you get so many votes here or so many votes there," he said, adding later: "At the time we decided not to invite Castro and Arafat, nobody was thinking about it. We thought it was the right thing to do. I continue to think it's the right thing to do."</p>
        <p>But his defense of his actions took place at a purely emotional level, one that could not help but appeal to anyone who had ever been outraged by a terrorist action in the Middle East. He read a letter of support he received yesterday from the daughters of Leon Klinghoffer, who was killed by Palestinian  terrorists aboard the cruise ship Achille Lauro 10 years ago. And asked about criticism he received on Tuesday from the State Department, he said he preferred the views of the Klinghoffer daughters and accused the department of not realizing that Mr. Arafat was a terrorist and a murderer.</p>
        <p>"People remember that this week is the anniversary of Klinghoffer's death," said Jules Polonetsky, an assemblyman from Coney Island and an Orthodox Jew. "The overwhelming reaction to this is going to be positive, even among those who support the peace plan, because they see a man who stands up for what he believes in." He added that he did not think the Mayor had acted in a calculating way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koch agreed that the Mayor exhibited a form of courage but said he showed very little common sense. Mr. Giuliani diminished the stature of New York City and enhanced the stature of Mr. Arafat, Mr. Koch said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani retorted that Mr. Koch was being intellectually dishonest, because Mr. Koch himself denounced the P.L.O. leader as a murderer while in office. Recalling the moment when Mr. Koch referred to the United Nations as a cesspool, the Mayor said: "I think if we're going to take lessons on diplomacy and the way in which to express yourself, the last person in the world you should take it from is Ed Koch."</p>
        <p>The Mayor was unable to shed any light yesterday on one of the abiding mysteries of the incident, which is how Mr. Arafat received his tickets to the New York Philharmonic concert at Lincoln Center. Mr. Giuliani repeatedly said that Mr. Arafat was not invited to the concert, but yesterday the Palestinian Mission to the United Nations produced a letter sent by the United Nations Protocol Office inviting the P.L.O. delegation to the concert.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said that only the United Nations Host Committee -- the private  group he established to sponsor the concert and other events -- was authorized to provide tickets and that the city informed the United Nations that the P.L.O. and seven nations not recognized by the United States would be excluded.</p>
        <p>But the city's letter to the United Nations was sent last Friday, only four days before the concert. The United Nations' invitation to the Palestinians was  dated Sept. 27, more than three weeks earlier, and included detailed instructions on how the tickets could be picked up at the U.N. The letters leave the clear impression that the Palestinians received their tickets long before the city decided Mr. Arafat could not come.</p>
