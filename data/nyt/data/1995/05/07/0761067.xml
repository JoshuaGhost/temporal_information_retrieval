        <p>I WOULD wait to see the mural -- huge, multicolored and fastened to the Alexander's department store at the mall in Paramus. When it appeared, it meant that the ride, finally, was over.</p>
        <p>This was a regular destination of my childhood, a place where I learned to make decisions. Since we couldn't afford two dresses, my mom would explain, I could choose only one.

        <p>I WOULD wait to see the mural -- huge, multicolored and fastened to the Alexander's department store at the mall in Paramus. When it appeared, it meant that the ride, finally, was over.</p>
        <p>This was a regular destination of my childhood, a place where I learned to make decisions. Since we couldn't afford two dresses, my mom would explain, I could choose only one. And it seemed, happily, that whichever I chose was always right, the most beautiful dress in the store, to hear her tell it.</p>
        <p>At that Alexander's, I also made a wondrous discovery. When Mom and I settled down with our purchases for a celebratory dish of ice cream at 3 P.M., other people were just eating lunch. Lunch, in the middle of the day! Not at noon, when I had to eat it. The world was suddenly filled with possibility.</p>
        <p>As an adult, I found that one of those possibilities was to skip the car ride and shop by phone. Catalogues! They come to me by the bushel, it seems, and the pleasure of shopping under the covers almost makes up for the fact that every spare corner of my New York apartment is stacked with boxes, waiting to go back to the post office.</p>
        <p>Decorating drawbacks aside, I find catalogue shopping preferable to navigating the jammed department stores in Manhattan, not to mention the jammed Manhattan streets.</p>
        <p>"I have nothing to wear," I moan on a regular basis, while my box-beleaguered husband begs, "Go out and buy something!"</p>
        <p>Well, maybe it wouldn't kill me to try. Somehow, out of town, I never seem to mind shopping. And now I've been asked to investigate the Mall at Short Hills, which I've heard is an upscale experience, like the Houston Galleria or the Mall at Bal Harbour, both of which I've liked and where I've -- drumroll -- actually bought things.</p>
        <p>I pick a Monday, on the assumption that everyone else will be working and I'll have the place to myself, or almost, and I'm right. I arrive about 10:30 and the speakers are playing classical music. A few elderly people walk by. A mom with a stroller. And me. Actually, this might work. I like the feeling of open space -- light, airy, calm. Everything looks clean.</p>
        <p>There are 130 stores here, and my game plan is to try only the ones that interest me. What interests me most actually hasn't opened -- Neiman Marcus (I'm a devotee of their catalogue) and Nordstrom's, both of which are due in August, along with Crate and Barrel, Tiffany and Dean &amp; DeLuca. These last three I can find in Manhattan, of course, but to shop at the other two is still not a privilege extended to New Yorkers. Which might be the strongest argument for coming here. Something you can't find in New York? The nerve! And not only that, but soon this mall will combine Fifth Avenue, SoHo, and Dallas -- without the air fare. Talk about progress.</p>
        <p>Another benefit of shopping in New Jersey is the absence of sales tax on clothing (and a lesser sales tax than in New York on everything else), but even with that potential saving, I'm laughing just as loudly at the price tags at this Polo Ralph Lauren as I do in New York. Someone here, though, goes to the trouble of saying hello and seems at least marginally glad to see me. In the New York store, I'm invisible.</p>
        <p>Which I'm more used to than I realized. After an alarmingly cheerful reception at Banana Republic (what if I just don't want to look like Isak Dinesen?), I retreat to Bloomingdale's, hoping for anonymity. I find myself in the Night Glamour department, which is fortunate because I could definitely use some. And not in black. Like everyone else in New York I own too much black, and I'm here to change it. I see something ivory, which I take to the very large fitting room equipped with a three-paneled mirror, upholstered chair and freshly vacuumed carpet.</p>
        <p>Lord, this looks awful. What did I eat this weekend? This is why I don't like shopping. You have to confront the two least appetizing aspects of life -- your stomach and your wallet. Who needs it? A woman I know who is a shopper extraordinaire says she is hooked on shopping's fantasy appeal. "You find something and think, I could look like Carole Lombard," she says. Well, sure, I know what she means. The only problem is just at the moment your husband is opening the front door to leave for the long-anticipated black-tie event, you take one last look in the mirror and shriek, "But I'm not Carole Lombard! Why did I buy this? I can't go!" And after some tense negotiations -- not to mention ultimatums -- you ditch the Lombard look, put on the same black dress with the shiny seams you've had since college and drag yourself out. So much for fantasy.</p>
        <p>And so much for this ivory dress, which is truly depressing me. I'll feel better if I eat lunch.</p>
        <p>I'm sort of surprised that the mall's culinary delights don't match the level of its retail. Joe's Bar &amp; Grill seems a step up, though, and smells good, in spite of kids kicking one another under the tables while their mothers stare into space, exhausted. I, however, make the supreme sacrifice of staying out of Friendly's, and choose Sbarro for a (plain) slice of pizza and a Diet Coke.</p>
        <p>As I chew my pizza 100 times to make it last longer, I think of leaving, declaring defeat. Ivory has beaten me. I'm not thin enough. I call my sister at work. She is a supreme shopper who couldn't get the day off to come with me.</p>
        <p>"You've been there an hour and you haven't bought anything?" She is incredulous.</p>
        <p>I tell her about the dress. "My advice is, 'You're never too fat for shoes,' " she says. "In the afternoon when you feel thinner, go back to clothes."</p>
        <p>This makes sense. With renewed purpose, I head to Bally. There are two older women already there. "I'm looking for casual shoes for Bermuda," one tells the other. The saleswoman, who is pregnant, is on the floor fitting another customer. "Welcome to Bally, ladies," she calls out. I browse. Whether inspired by my sister or the fact that this woman's belly is actually bigger than mine, I buy a pair of navy loafers. Not cheap, but Bally is good value. They last. I sign the receipt. No tax. Excellent.</p>
        <p>Once she lifts herself off the floor, the saleswoman is chatty, though she won't give her name. There are lots of shoppers who come here from New York, she says, because there's no tax. As for it not being too crowded today, she says, "Some customers are intimidated by our price points, so they don't come here at all."</p>
        <p>I leave her with a psychological lift now, just from holding a bag. "I buy," it says. Confident, I stride into Bruno Magli. And try not to gulp. Talk about price points. It makes Bally look like a bargain basement.</p>
        <p>There's Jaeger. Not my style, really (think British librarian), but maybe there's a sweater on sale. "Feel free to browse," says the gray-haired saleswoman, "and if I can be of any assistance don't hesitate." Wow, what a welcome. She could probably get a better job somewhere else as a butler. These clothes, however, are not for me. They remind me of my old boyfriend's mother.</p>
        <p>Next is Laura Ashley. There are three of them here, one for home, one for Mother and Child and one for women's clothes. I try on some floral print shifts and look like Fergie on a fat day. A sleeker navy model makes me look like a governess. Enough with these British fantasies. It's one thing to aspire to Carole Lombard, quite another to Dame Mae Whitty.</p>
        <p>Ah, Barney's. Now, this place is a real love-hate relationship for me. I love getting gifts from here but hate going. Mostly because that way I see the price tags. And the attitude. Well, out here, not half as much attitude as in the city, but oh, those price tags. The earrings I like? $760. Well, if I really need them I could always cash in an IRA.</p>
        <p>I try on a hair ornament. "Do you need help?" trumpets a saleswoman in black, who has spotted my notebook. "Are you from a competing vendor?" she asks sharply. I explain my mission and she softens, leading me to the apothecary department and showing me different brands of lotions and potions to beautify the skin and hair.</p>
        <p>"This is Neal's Yard, which is made in a convent."</p>
        <p>No kidding?</p>
        <p>"To me that's interesting, not superficial, like everything else in the fashion world," she goes on. I picture an enclave of women of God setting aside their rosary beads to press the oil from rosemary leaves, so that harried women in the New York metropolitan area can refresh their sagging spirits. Talk about selfless. Then she shows me the literature. The convent she's talking about where Neal's Yard is located is actually Covent Garden. Oh.</p>
        <p>"And Molton Brown from England," she goes on, pointing to its massage oil. "We're the only store in the New York City area to carry these brands."</p>
        <p>Except for Portico Bed and Bath, a branch of the SoHo store, just down the mall a ways. Well, exclusive enough.</p>
        <p>I go on my way. I don't even have the courage to walk into Fratelli Rosetti, a shoe store that looks like an art gallery. These are shoes to worship. The last place they belong is touching the ground.</p>
        <p>A saleswoman at the woman's clothing store Episode agrees that the prices at the mall generally tend to be high. 'And this isn't a hangout kind of mall where you see kids," she says. "There's no food court. Until recently, there wasn't even a sitdown place for customers. It's more exclusive than many of the other malls."</p>
        <p>Indeed, a walk through the Mall at Short Hills makes you believe that happy days are here again. 'Help Wanted' signs appear in many shop windows. Traffic has picked up with the lunch hour and the mood is light. Especially at Victoria's Secret, where some local high school girls are buying sexy underwear. Seems like a fun community.</p>
        <p>Mac Cosmetics, which is on Christopher Street in New York, gets my vote for the most chic-looking store in the mall, beautifully designed. And here's a Lillie Rubin! I haven't seen one in years. When I was a child I always wanted to shop there when I grew up. A quick look at the merchandise confirms that I'm still not old enough.</p>
        <p>At Lady Footlocker I find a brand of New Balance running shoe that I can't get in the city anymore. I'm thrilled. I splurge for sweat socks to go with them.</p>
        <p>"You're spending the day at the Short Hills Mall and you're buying sneakers?" My sister is incredulous again. "Buy something fun." Oh, O.K.</p>
        <p>I head to the beautiful Saks Fifth Avenue, which just opened here in November. It is sparkling looking, stocked to the brim with merchandise. And completely empty.</p>
        <p>I take full advantage of this situation by heading to the Chanel counter. Here I find Angie to help me, very chatty and thrilled at the company. She tells me that the mall's Abraham &amp; Straus will soon be turning into a "very upscale" Macy's. And while she acknowledges that business today is "dead," she says that on weekends it's much more crowded. I get some Chanel No. 5 Eau de Parfum spray, and she adds all sorts of giveaways -- hand lotion, makeup bag. Everyone out here is so nice. They actually do stuff that makes you want to come back. Though, finally, I encounter tax. Six percent. Still lower than New York, she points out.</p>
        <p>I go up to the second floor via the escalator. A woman behind me waves to a woman going down on the opposite side. "Love you in that purple," she calls out.</p>
        <p>Off the men's department there's a New World Coffee, where I collapse with my packages and virtuously sip San Pellegrino water while eavesdropping on two women discussing their friend's gambling problem.</p>
        <p>Time to go. This was actually a day well spent, I think, heading out to the parking lot. And in August, when the other stores open, I might even come back. I've heard that the mural is still fastened to the Alexanders in Paramus, which is now out of business. Maybe they could move it here. BOOKSHELF The Literature Of the American Mall</p>
        <p>As they've become symbols of suburbia, the new town squares, America's malls have inspired a literature of their own. Here are a few examples:</p>
        <p>In reality, even the largest of malls are almost the opposite of downtown areas because they are self-contained and because they impose a uniformity of tastes and interests. They cater exclusively to middle-class tastes and contain no unsavory bars or pornography shops, no threatening-looking characters, no litter, no rain, and no excessive heat or cold. . . . Despite their blandness, the shopping malls and the drive-in culture of which they are a part have clearly eclipsed the traditional central business districts.</p>
        <p>-- Kenneth T. Jackson,  "Crabgrass Frontier," 1985</p>
        <p>When I returned to Greensburg and began wandering through the new world of Greengate Mall, it seemed clear to me that television, suburbia, the Highway, the Baby Boom and the Bomb had all prepared the way for the mall -- had even conspired somehow to create it. It was an intuition more physical than intellectual at first; just the way the mall sat on the landscape, the way it looked and felt inside -- the way it glowed. I felt that somehow, for good or ill or quite possibly both, this was it, the embodiment of it all. The aura of something that's been perfected was so strong -- the mall seemed to be the fruition of all the prophecies, promises, dire warnings and false starts that I could remember.  -- William Severini Kowinski,  "The Malling of America," 1985</p>
        <p>Now the three of us go through a department store at the mall, then split up and agree to meet at the fountain. I head for the mock outdoor cafe and get in line to order a chocolate-filled croissant, but a young guy with ratty hair and a silver shirt open to the waist comes in singing a torch song and pushes in front of me. He jokes with one of the girls behind the counter. They're in French-maid uniforms. I figure he's a local celebrity, maybe a drummer in some important band. The girl he's talking to likes him, which I think is amazing. I'm wondering about that when Cleo comes up.</p>
        <p>"I hate to shop," she says. She orders a spinach croissant, then leads the way to a wire-topped table out in the mall. -- Frederick Barthelme,  "Cleo," 1987</p>
        <p>Tomorrow morning Nola returns to school in Maine; today will be spent at the mall. Mrs. Dietrich has planned it for days -- there are numerous things Nola needs, mainly clothes, a pair of good shoes; Mrs. Dietrich must buy a birthday present for one of her aunts; mother and daughter need the time together. At the mall, in such crowds of shoppers, moments of intimacy are possible as they rarely are at home.  -- Joyce Carol Oates,  "Shopping," 1991</p>
