        <p>Suppose somebody writes a book called "Abduction: Human Encounters With Aliens," consisting mainly of the case histories of 13 people who say they have been abducted by diminutive, large-eyed, gray-colored space creatures and forced to have sex with them. And the book becomes a national best seller and the author a star on the talk-show circuit.</p>
        <p>Then suppose the author is a tenured professor at Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <p>If you're Harvard, what do you do?</p>
        <p>That's the conundrum that for the past year has bedeviled Daniel Tosteson, dean of the Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <p>The best-seller by Professor John E. Mack, a 65-year-old psychiatrist at the Harvard Medical School's Cambridge Hospital, may be easy to dismiss as out of touch with reality. But the question of the rights and responsibilities of a university to protect its reputation when that may conflict with academic freedom could hardly be presented more starkly.</p>
        <p>Proceeding cautiously last year, Dean Tosteson appointed a committee of Dr. Mack's peers to evaluate his research methods. Now, after more than 30 closed-door hearings over the past 12 months, the committee is about to deliver a report said to be sharply critical of Dr. Mack.</p>
        <p>After that, the matter will have to be resolved between Dean Tosteson, Dr. Mack's lawyer and perhaps some diminutive, large-eyed, gray beings who claim tenure. WILLIAM H. HONAN</p>
