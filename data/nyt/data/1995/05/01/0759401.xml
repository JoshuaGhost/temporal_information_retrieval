        <p>The field was wet. The ball was slippery. The conditions, over all, were sloppy.</p>
        <p>Still, Bobby Bonilla had no excuse.</p>
        <p>"I screwed up," Bonilla said after the Mets lost, 3-0, to the St. Louis Cardinals at Shea Stadium yesterday. "That's all there is to it."</p>
        <p>Bonilla's mistake was a throwing error in the sixth inning, on a ground ball hit by Brian Jordan. With one out and no score, Bobby Jones had induced Jordan into the perfect double-play ball, an infield grounder with Scott Cooper on first. But Bonilla's throw was wide right, drawing Edgardo Alfonzo off the second-base bag, and putting him out of position to make the play. It also left Alfonzo with too little time to catch Jordan -- one of the National League's fastest runners -- at first base.</p>
        <p>One out later, Danny Sheaffer hit a three-run homer to left, scoring the only runs in the game. The Mets, who have had at least 10 hits in each of their first 4 contests, managed just 3 off Tom Urbani, the Cardinals' left-handed starter, and 4 for the game. Their record is 2-3.</p>
        <p>"If we didn't make that one error," Mets Manager Dallas Green said, "we'd still be playing."</p>
        <p>The game was played, for the most part, in a light rain, and on a field so slippery that Carl Everett, the Met right fielder, slid a good 10 feet across the grass after fielding one hit. Bonilla's costly throw was one of three poor throws he made -- two were scored errors -- and catcher Kelly Stinnett also overthrew a ball.</p>
        <p>Stinnett's throw came on a play that resulted in a controversial call by Frank Ballina, the plate umpire, and, as a result, the Cardinals played the rest of the game under protest. Ballina -- the same replacement umpire who threw Bonilla and Green out of the game in Colorado last Wednesday -- called Jose Oquendo, the batter, out for having run out of the basepath as he approached first. Ballina then moved the Cardinals' other two runners, John Mabry and Sheaffer, back to second and first.</p>
        <p>Mabry had originally scored on the play and Sheaffer had reached third.</p>
        <p>Joe Torre, the Cardinals' manager, said after the game that the call had been correct by the book -- Oquendo was in the way of first baseman Rico Brogna -- but he argued the point because Stinnett's throw had been so errant that Oquendo's location in the basepath would not have mattered. And Torre blew up when he was told, by Ballina, that the umpire was denying his request to play the game under protest. Ballina eventually reversed that call.</p>
        <p>"They're not major league umpires," said Torre, who was less upset after the final score made the play meaningless.</p>
        <p>The call was a break for Jones, though, who came into yesterday's game not having given up a run to the Cardinals in his career. That stretch reached 24 2/3 innings before Sheaffer's home run, and Jones has yet to give up an earned run to St. Louis.</p>
        <p>"There are going to be errors made," said Jones, who followed his unimpressive first start against the Rockies with a solid, seven-inning performance that included eight hits, no walks and two strikeouts. "When something like that happens, you have to pick guys up, and in this situation, I didn't."</p>
        <p>Jones did manage to pick up Bonilla in the second inning, when another throwing error by the third baseman put runners at first and second with no outs. Of course, he was helped by Ballina's call, and by Stinnett, who picked Mabry off at second base with a throw to shortstop Jose Vizcaino.</p>
        <p>Unlike the previous four games, though, the Mets' major problem wasn't the pitching, it was the hitting. Urbani seemed to stymie the club, which had a .308 team batting average coming into the game. How good was Urbani? He even managed to strike out Brett Butler, a master at working the count, on three pitches, with the third being a called strike.</p>
        <p>"He pitched well," said Bonilla, who was surprisingly affable for a man who had just finished a two-error, 0-for-4 game. "We just had a tough day."</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>EDGARDO ALFONZO started at second in place of JEFF KENT, who has a sore rib cage. It was Alfonzo's first major league start. . . . The attendance was announced as 51,715 -- apparently the Mets managed to sell a lot of tickets for their second day of "Baseball for a Buck" -- but with the nasty weather, the actual crowd did not even approach one-third that number.
