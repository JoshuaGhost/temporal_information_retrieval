        <p>Once upon a better time, elder people were not as isolated as they are today from family significant others. In her April 16 Soapbox essay, "A Survival Kit," Terry Kushner doesn't question the fact that her son lives 3,000 miles away and a brother lives on Long Island. She compensates by involvement in a senior center, which is commendable, but something is very unnatural about a society where so often sons and daughters move far away from their parents and roots.</p>

        <p>Once upon a better time, elder people were not as isolated as they are today from family significant others. In her April 16 Soapbox essay, "A Survival Kit," Terry Kushner doesn't question the fact that her son lives 3,000 miles away and a brother lives on Long Island. She compensates by involvement in a senior center, which is commendable, but something is very unnatural about a society where so often sons and daughters move far away from their parents and roots.</p>
        <p>Everyone loses in this situation, but the parents, grandparents and other elder kin feel it most keenly. What a waste of life it is to be separated most of the time from those you love most. At least, that's how this mother of adult sons who now live in California experiences it. Work, civic and religious interests and friends just don't fill the need. BETTE DEWING Manhattan</p>
