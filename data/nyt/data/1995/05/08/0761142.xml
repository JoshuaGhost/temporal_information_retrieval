        <p>Four advertisers made changes in their accounts last week.</p>
        <p>The AT&amp;T Corporation has named the San Francisco office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, a unit of True North Communications, as the first agency to handle advertising for its consumer interactive services division in Parsippany, N.J. The billings were estimated at $15 million. Executives speaking on the condition of anonymity said Foote, Cone was awarded the account without a review; a Foote, Cone sibling, FCB/Leber Katz Partners, already works for AT&amp;T.

Foote, Cone executives in San Francisco declined to comment.</p>
        <p>The Gemstar Development Corporation, which markets electronics products like the VCR Plus videocassette recorder programming system, has named Korey Kay &amp; Partners in New York to handle its account, previously in-house. The billings were estimated at $15 million.</p>
        <p>Linda Lloyd da Silva, vice president for marketing and media at Gemstar in Pasadena, Calif., said Korey Kay was awarded the account after a five-month review that was narrowed to that agency and the Los Angeles office of Lord, Dentsu &amp; Partners, a joint venture of Dentsu and Young &amp; Rubicam.</p>
        <p>The Royal Mistic beverages unit of Joseph Victori Wines in Brooklyn has named Krimstein/Clapps in New York to handle its account, which had been at Avrett, Free &amp; Ginsberg in New York for the last two years. The billings were estimated at $8 million to $10 million.</p>
        <p>Bob Sarlin, Mistic's in-house creative director in New Rochelle, N.Y., said Krimstein/Clapps was awarded the account after a three-month review that was narrowed to Krimstein/Clapps, Avrett and six other finalists, all in New York: Ahern Needleman Fleizach, the Alfstad Blank Group, Ciociola &amp; Company, Klein &amp; Solin, Pedone &amp; Partners and Slater Hanft Martin.</p>
        <p>And Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners in New York, which handles the Snapple beverages account for the Quaker Oats Company in the United States, has been awarded the creative assignment for the brand in the English-speaking provinces of Canada. The billings were not disclosed.  THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA</p>
