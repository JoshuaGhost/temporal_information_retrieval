        <p>FISCAL CHANGE COMES FASTER THAN HOPED</p>
        <p>For several years, fiscal analysts and public officials have warned that New York City might no longer be able to afford the government and services it had built over half a century. They urged gradual and planned shrinkage. But now, change is coming far faster than many people wanted or expected because three levels of government are rushing toward the same goal: a smaller, less ambitious bureaucracy. While the ultimate shape of Federal, state and local legislation and budgets is still unclear, some economists are already speaking of New York City's future in phrases once reserved to describe Eastern Europe's bumpy transition from Communism to capitalism.</p>
        <p>"In the long run, the lesson of the next few years may be that New York is simply not wealthy or economically vital enough to afford the extensive public sector that it has created over the post great Depression period," the investment banking firm J. P. Morgan said in a recent report to investors in the municipal market. "But dismantling it will take time: the new financial plans share a brand of shock therapy that may not be acceptable to the public." A1. NEW YORK CITY  CORRUPTION CASES MAY BE EASIER</p>
        <p>As the cases against 16 officers who were indicted last week in the 48th Precinct in the Bronx begin to move through the courts, some legal experts and police officials said they believe that prosecutors may have a better chance of making the charges stick than in other recent police corruption scandals. In the last two months, prosecutors have been stung by a series of courtroom defeats in cases against officers in the city's two largest corruption investigations, in the 30th Precinct in Harlem and the 73d in Brooklyn. B3. POLICE COMMISSIONER PLEDGES VIGILANCE</p>
        <p>Pledging a renewed effort to attack corruption, the Police Commissioner said he had created a new post to speed the dismissal of corrupt officers who escape the wrath of the legal system. "I have just created the position of special prosecutor in my own department to get these people off the job within 30 days," Commissioner William J. Bratton said. "Just get them in, get them tried and get rid of them." The creation of the new post is part of an overall "integrity strategy" that the Commissioner said he intends to present to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani later this week. B3. MAN SEEKS TO HONOR VICTIMS OF A SINKING</p>
        <p>As the nation commemorates the 50th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe, a former New York police officer is trying to make sure the sinking of the S.S. Leopoldville becomes more than a footnote in the history books. The troopship was sunk by a German torpedo in the English Channel on Christmas Eve 1944, with the loss of 802 American infantrymen, one of the worst naval disasters in the history of the United States.

        <p>A group of Jewish police officers from New York traveled to Berlin to honor a non-Jewish German policeman who defended a synagogue during the depredations of Kristallnacht in 1938. International Report, A4. REGION  PUBLIC MONEY FOR CAMPAIGNS</p>
        <p>With big-money campaign contributions more important than ever, the Connecticut Legislature is considering a move that could make its governor's race the first in the nation to be financed almost entirely with public money. Secretary of the State Miles S. Rapoport, a Democrat and the state's chief elections official, has proposed slashing the maximum contribution in the governor's race to $250 from $5,000, making it the lowest in the country, and using tax money to finance as much as 94 percent of a candidate's campaign. B5. BATTLE RESUMES OVER ELLIS ISLAND BRIDGE</p>
        <p>New Jersey generally loves it. New York hates it. And both sides are again marshaling their forces for a renewed struggle over construction of a proposed bridge from New Jersey to Ellis Island. This year's contest is especially rancorous because each side is trying to club the other into submission with portions of a new report by the National Park Service on the bridge's environmental impact.
