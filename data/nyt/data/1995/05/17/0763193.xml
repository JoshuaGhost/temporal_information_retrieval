        <p>Anfernee Hardaway threw the ball down with 2 minutes 59 seconds remaining, a dunk that floored Bill Wennington and rocked Orlando Arena. Shaquille O'Neal bottled up the middle in the fourth quarter, reversing shots and jumping over everyone for rebounds. And Horace Grant continued to singe his former team, one critical jump shot at a time.</p>
        <p>The Orlando Magic, the most talented team ever to go nowhere in the playoffs a year ago, showed its post-season mettle as never before tonight. Shaq and friends recovered from a dismal first half to turn back Michael Jordan and the playoff-hardened Chicago Bulls by a score of 103-95 in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>
        <p>The Magic took a 3-2 lead in the four-of-seven-game series with a third-period barrage and some flair in the final minutes.</p>
        <p>"The door is not closed yet," said Jordan, who scored 39 points on 15-of-28 shooting. "I've been here before. I haven't been there for a while, but I won't focus on the negative. We're still alive."</p>
        <p>Still, with Game 6 scheduled for Thursday in Chicago, that playoff coronation of Jordan and the Bulls is in serious jeopardy. The suddenness of His Royal Airness's return in March may soon be replaced by the suddenness of the Bulls' departure from the playoffs. They would need to emerge with victories Thursday in Game 6 and Sunday in Game 7 to reach the conference finals for the first time in three seasons.</p>
        <p>Jordan brought the Bulls within 6 points with less than five minutes remaining on a pair of jumpers from the right baseline, but the Magic burned the Bulls on defense by rotating the ball around the wing until it found someone cutting to the goal for a dunk.</p>
        <p>The clincher was Hardaway's basket that built the lead to 10 with under three minutes left.</p>
        <p>O'Neal made only 7 of 20 from the field and 9 of 19 from the line for 23 points, but he grabbed 20 rebounds, blocked 5 shots and awoke from a first-half slumber to help key a third-period run.</p>
        <p>"I wasn't really frustrated," he said. "I haven't been off in about 80 games, and I was saying to myself, 'Why now?' But I didn't give up. In the second half, I just went in, took a couple of deep breaths and just came out and took my time.</p>
        <p>"My moves started falling, free throws started falling. So we just have to go for the kill on Thursday."</p>
        <p>Grant, meanwhile, bucking for most valuable player honors in the series, made 10 of 13 from the field and finished with 24 points, a career playoff high for him. He is now 42 for 60 for the series, tearing up his former team from the field every chance the ball floats into his hands. The Bulls' penchant for leaving him alone while they double-team every other weapon on the roster has been one of the bigger miscalculations of the series.</p>
        <p>"I think he has been their m.v.p.," Jordan said. "He's knocked down shots that have made our defense work harder. We have tried to rotate away from him as much as possible, allowing the outside shot. He has knocked it down."</p>
        <p>Dennis Scott finished with 22 points and Hardaway added 19 points and 11 assists.</p>
        <p>The Magic built a 81-70 lead moments into the fourth quarter after trailing by 7 at halftime. Grant (10 points) and Scott combined for 19 points as Orlando hit 15 of 20 shots in the third period, including 9 of its first 10.</p>
        <p>Only two other Bulls besides Jordan -- B. J. Armstrong (18 points) and Scottie Pippen (10 points, 11 rebounds) -- scored in double figures.</p>
        <p>Before the third period, Orlando appeared certain for a collapse on its home floor.</p>
        <p>Bringing two of its primary liabilities to bear -- atrocious free-throw shooting and playoff inexperience -- Orlando reaffirmed its reputation as one of the most unpredictable teams in the post-season, falling apart in the first half on both ends of the floor.</p>
        <p>O'Neal was the biggest conspirator, hitting only 2 of his first 12 shots and missing his first 6 free throws. Worse for the Magic, Hardaway left the game limping with 1:29 remaining in the second quarter after he reinjured his bruised left foot. He returned in the third quarter, as did his team in a very large way.</p>
        <p>Steve Kerr, the Bulls' reserve guard who has put the series in perspective all along, said, "They've obviously handled the inexperience factor well."  1995 N.B.A. PLAYOFFS</p>
