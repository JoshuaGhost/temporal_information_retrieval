        <p>In the 1930's the Socialists and Communists of Europe had a unity slogan -- "no enemies on the left."</p>
        <p>It was not comradeship that made the non-Communist left decide that the Communists could not be enemies. It was fear -- fear of the rising Hitler and of the support he was getting from the non-Nazi conservatives of Germany.</p>

        <p>In the 1930's the Socialists and Communists of Europe had a unity slogan -- "no enemies on the left."</p>
        <p>It was not comradeship that made the non-Communist left decide that the Communists could not be enemies. It was fear -- fear of the rising Hitler and of the support he was getting from the non-Nazi conservatives of Germany.</p>
        <p>That decision could be defended as emergency anti-Fascism. But over the years it became built into the non-Communist left and muted criticism of Communist dictatorships -- from Stalin's to Castro's. The failure to recognize that long term the Communists were enemies of freedom became the intellectual and political graveyard of the non-Communist left.</p>
        <p>This reminder comes from Jeffrey Herf of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. I pass it on for the urgent attention of American conservatives. God save them and the country from the attitude that is creeping over mainstream American conservatism -- no enemies on the right.</p>
        <p>One important result of Oklahoma, whoever is found guilty, is that it forced America to see and smell the bands of armed bigots that infest the country, preaching hatred of American society and warfare against the laws that bind it together.</p>
        <p>But listen to what so many conservative Republican politicians and like-minded journalists have been saying after the bombing -- and for what they do not say.</p>
        <p>They were shocked. But, snap, they found something that seemed to shock them as much. The target of choice became not the hatred behind the bombing, but President Clinton for his denunciations of those who spread hatred and for suggesting -- too briefly -- that some of it came over the airwaves. Ooh, horror, they shouted, he is destroying the First Amendment -- as if it outlawed criticism of those who live to destroy it.</p>
        <p>Now we hear something more dangerous -- attempts to rationalize the nastiness in American life brought to logical result by the bombing and represented by the militias and their supporters.</p>
        <p>We are treated to lectures and columns about how we city folk must understand the fears in Rural America, how angry they are out there at law enforcement officials who get in their hair, how important are the memories of Waco.</p>
        <p>Representative Newt Gingrich is one of the important Republicans who tells us all that. Certainly there's some truth in it. But because of what he and other Republicans do not say, the lecture becomes not insight but a classic case of the disease of moral equivalence -- equal weight to good and evil, truth and myth, or reality and nightmare, without drawing the line between them.</p>
        <p>They do not say that the fear is deliberately fed and spread by the bigotry brigades, that although hearings on Waco are justified, equating law enforcement with spreading gunpoint hatred is shameful, and that American citizens must learn the difference between the two.</p>
        <p>Are the votes conservatives may get from evading the truth about the far right so completely overriding to them that they are doing what the moderate left did in Europe when it allied itself with Communists, what American liberals did when they abandoned the anti-Communist cause, what the German conservatives did when they decided that the world had to understand the Nazis?</p>
        <p>Let's investigate Waco, conservatives should be saying now. But only if they add: at the same time we should investigate, fast, whether the U.S. has the right to allow these private armies to exist, when the Supreme Court has ruled that all military operations should be under government control -- and what legal steps we can take to put them out of operation.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, conservatives will be opting out of a critical moral struggle, and out of historic reality. Daddy, what did you do when the militias were growing?</p>
        <p>Republican politicians should be out there doing their job, which becomes more important the more that Americans lean toward conservatism. They should be drawing clear differences between conservatism that Americans should vote for and right-wing hate peddling that they should be fighting as enemy to conservatism and the country. Else they betray themselves, and all Americans who believed in the essential decency of mainstream conservatism, and still do.</p>
