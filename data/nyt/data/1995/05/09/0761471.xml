        <p>Youth of America, heed this word:</p>
        <p>Downsizing.</p>
        <p>It is the word of the future. Remember it: Downsizing.</p>
        <p>Say it three times: "Downsizing. Downsizing. Downsizing."</p>
        <p>Now it will stay with you.</p>
        <p>Holding it firmly in mind -- say it once again for good measure -- "Downsizing" -- that's the way to hold it firmly in mind -- now holding it firmly in mind, study its verbal and adjectival offshoots.</p>
        <p>These are downsized and -- are you ready for this? -- downsized.</p>
        <p>Yes, both the verb and adjective are the same: downsized.</p>
        <p>Illustrations:</p>
        <p>Verb form: Consolidated has downsized again.</p>
        <p>Adjective form: See the downsized 49-year-old man.</p>
        <p>"Heavens!" you cry. "Has that 49-year-old man been shrunk like a fine woolen sweater washed in boiling water?"</p>
        <p>No, he has not been shrunk. He has been laid off from work. We no longer say "laid off." We now say "downsized."</p>
        <p>You naturally ask:</p>
        <p>"Does it follow then that Consolidated, having downsized again, has also been laid off and, therefore, no longer produces its magnificent consolidations?"</p>
        <p>Not at all. Here is something that is fun to say: Lean and mean.</p>
        <p>Say it a few times to feel the delightful yet muscular humor of it.</p>
        <p>"Lean and mean. Lean and mean. Lean and so on."</p>
        <p>Good. Now the downsizing that occurred when Consolidated downsized not only produced that 49-year-old downsized man you saw, but it also rendered the company lean and mean.</p>
        <p>As we have seen, "lean and mean" is delightful to say, and saying pleasant things puts people in pleasant moods. When Wall Street people are in a pleasant mood they invest in things that have made them feel pleasant.</p>
        <p>In our hypothetical case, the source of Wall Street's happy mood is Consolidated, whose downsizing has given investors the pleasant opportunity to say "lean and mean."</p>
        <p>Result?</p>
        <p>Up goes Consolidated's stock.</p>
        <p>In short, Consolidated upsizes by downsizing.</p>
        <p>Youth of America, you stand today on the threshold of (insert any one of 12,000 commencement speeches to be made this month).</p>
        <p>Naturally then, you are worried about your future. Does it make sense, you ask, to go to work for a great company like Consolidated?</p>
        <p>It does not. Think:</p>
        <p>If an employer's continued upsizing requires continued downsizing, why would a logical person wish to work for him?</p>
        <p>The reason is obvious: Because that person wants to become the first illustration in a primer on economics which begins:</p>
        <p>"Look, children, look. Look and see the downsized 49-year-old man."</p>
        <p>Where, then, shall the youth of America look for work that will help them realize the traditional American yearning for food, clothing, shelter and a better life for their offspring than their own downsized existence?</p>
        <p>Many of you will say, "Dealing drugs. That's where it's at."</p>
        <p>Wrong. The pressures are murderous. Colombia downsizes even more completely than Consolidated.</p>
        <p>Heed these words, youth:</p>
        <p>Old people.</p>
        <p>America is producing old people at a prodigious rate, and things they cannot do are beyond belief. Youth's future lies in doing modern things that defeat the old.</p>
        <p>Idea 1: A business that not only installs VCR's for old people, but also programs them weekly to record favorite shows. At present nobody over age 22 can perform either task.</p>
        <p>Idea 2: An opening service for the millions defeated every day in the struggle to open modern packaging and containers. Like home-delivery pizza service, a phone call would bring highly skilled openers speeding to help incompetent old-timers.</p>
        <p>Thousands of similar opportunities for youth to profit from the incompetence of the aged will become apparent. Bill Gates, richest man in the universe, started this way: small.</p>
        <p>Should you be successful, who knows? You may end up downsizing and know the joy of leanness, meanness and spondulicks galore.</p>
