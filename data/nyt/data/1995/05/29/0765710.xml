        <p>Dave Mlicki did everything he could for seven innings.</p>
        <p>The 26-year-old right-hander matched San Francisco starter Mark Portugal zero for zero over the first five innings yesterday, allowed a home run to Barry Bonds on a good pitch in the sixth and had the Mets trailing by just a run after seven.</p>
        <p>The problem was, the Mets did not do anything for Mlicki. And then their No. 4 starter ran out of gas.</p>
        <p>Second baseman Steve Scarsone, who had struck out on sliders in his two previous at-bats, hit a two-run home run in the eighth on a hanging slider by Mlicki. Matt Williams, the hottest player in the National League, added another two-run blast against reliever Josias Manzanillo two batters later. And the Mets lost for the seventh time in their last eight games, this time by 5-1 before 24,456 fans at Shea Stadium.</p>
        <p>"He pitched lights out for a while," Mets Manager Dallas Green said of Mlicki. "Then he ran into trouble with guys he shouldn't run into. It was just a case of a guy pitching real good and we couldn't buy a run. We didn't turn the offensive faucet on today until too late. Too little, too late, I guess you could say.</p>
        <p>"And then our home-run problems cropped up again. We seem to have a penchant for those as the game goes into the seventh, eighth and ninth innings."</p>
        <p>And that is not a very good way to win ball games, as the Mets (11-19) have often found out this year. The Mets are also finding out that you have to score some runs to win them, too.</p>
        <p>"It's the same old thing," said Green. "If you're working on top of a lead, you've got a chance to make a mistake or two. When your offense isn't contributing anything and you have to continue to throw zeros up there, that gets a little tiresome."</p>
        <p>Green did not have many options on offense.</p>
        <p>Rico Brogna missed his third straight game with recurring back and hip soreness, and Green is concerned that he may miss more time.</p>
        <p>With both Todd Hundley (bruised left instep) and Kelly Stinnett (sprained right knee) unavailable and the Class AAA catcher Alberto Castillo making his major league debut, Green could not use Tim Bogar because he is the Mets' emergency catcher.</p>
        <p>Chris Jones, the only other position player available because the team is carrying 12 pitchers, homered off Portugal as a pinch-hitter in the eighth for the Mets' run.</p>
        <p>Brogna was in the on-deck circle when Bonds made a nice running catch in the left-field corner on Castillo's drive with runners on first and third to end the game. In all, the Mets stranded seven runners, three on third base.</p>
        <p>"You've got to get the runs when they're available to you," said Green. "You can't wait for somebody to hit a home run. It's just not going to happen on a consistent basis."</p>
        <p>Brett Butler, whose eighth-inning triple snapped a 3-for-34 slide, said: "It's just us putting it together. Now the pitching's doing the job. It's just getting everybody else clicking on all cylinders. It will happen, but we've got to do it quickly."</p>
        <p>Still, the Mets had a chance until the eighth. Green was not so upset with the shot by Williams, who looks as if he might make a run at the triple crown this year.</p>
        <p>"He's going to hit home runs no matter who you throw out there," the manager said. "Not unless you reincarnate Carl Hubbell or something. Scarsone is the guy. That home run hurt as much as anything. He's not supposed to hit home runs." INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DALLAS GREEN said he is growing concerned about RICO BROGNA's hip because "the doctors are starting to get that way." But Brogna said he feels better and explained: "Back in '91, I hurt my back playing in Mexico. It's just a lower-back pain that periodically acts up. When it gives me trouble, some of the pain and the inflammation goes to the hip. It's not degenerative, it's just something I have to put up with. It's just speculation on my part, but I think the Astroturf last week had something to do with it." . . . To make room for catcher ALBERTO CASTILLO, who was recalled from Class AAA Norfolk yesterday, the Mets optioned outfielder RICKY OTERO to the Tides. Otero was hitting .146. . . . TODD HUNDLEY hopes to be able to play by Tuesday. KELLY STINNETT said he could have played yesterday, but the Mets might put him on the disabled list. . . . JEFF KENT went 2 for 3 with a triple and his average is up to .245. EDGARDO ALFONZO has slumped to .222, however.</p>
