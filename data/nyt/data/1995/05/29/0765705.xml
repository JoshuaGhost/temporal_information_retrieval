        <p>A respectful ceremony is being held here today at the National Memorial that was the battleship Arizona.</p>
        <p>Memorial Day is set aside to remember those killed in all our wars. But on the golden anniversary of V-J Day, coming up on Sept. 2, we should go beyond remembrance.</p>
        <p>V-J + 50 years is a time to re-experience, to understand and to profit from the greatest event of this century: the victory of the free world over the forces of Germany's Naziism, Italy's Fascism and Japan's militaristic imperialism.</p>
        <p>V-E Day, a nearly comparable commemoration, was botched by an Administration eager to bolster the current Russian regime and snub the British. The historic moment was frittered away in a vain reach for transient summit success.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the moment is being lost again by a failure of vision.</p>
        <p>The three-day event in Hawaii is being planned by the Defense Department. Ceremonies will be held at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific; 20,000 veterans and armed service members will parade; salutes will be offered to uniformed representatives of countries involved in or touched by the war.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece will be the speech of the President of the U.S. aboard the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson, with the Arizona in the background. Bill Clinton will stand in the spotlight during three days of military pageantry, with no other world leader present.</p>
        <p>The event has been downgraded to the level of defense ministers. Military bureaucrats of 47 nations have been invited (including Russia, which helped little in defeating Imperial Japan; and Vietnam, opening the backdoor to diplomatic relations.)</p>
        <p>The decision not to invite the President of the Philippines (Bataan, Corregidor) is dismaying; the absence of Britain's prime minister and the leaders of Commonwealth and other nations that helped win the war is an affront to history; the failure to invite the prime minister of Japan wastes an opportunity for reconciliation.</p>
        <p>With no world leaders invited, no political or great moral lesson will be drawn from the victory. Little use will be made of the occasion to celebrate and advance the cause of freedom in Asia.</p>
        <p>Much of the thinking that led to this planned military extravaganza has been: How can we get past this day without offending the Japanese? At first, our embassy in Tokyo tried to rename it "Victory in the Pacific Day." With that roundly derided, the White House now calls the day everything: V-J, Victory in the Pacific, End of World War II Commemoration, whatever.</p>
        <p>Let's start afresh. A celebration needs a theme. Those chosen by the Pentagon -- "Remembering the War" and "Peace at Last" -- are banal and backward-looking. World War II was not fought to fight a war; it was fought to achieve a great moral purpose. The theme of V-J Day should be: the victory of democracy over tyranny, begun 50 years ago, is not yet finished.</p>
        <p>It's fine to recall Admiral Spruance's naval genius at the Battle of Midway and to rerun TV's "Victory at Sea," but unlike D-Day, V-J Day transcends any battle. Commemoration of the event that defines this century is too important to be left to the brass.</p>
        <p>Americans should take unabashed pride now in the democracy in the Philippines, our former colony; at the new freedom in Taiwan; closest to home, at the statehood of Hawaii, enriching our culture.</p>
        <p>And the U.S. should seize this opportunity to tell the world how proud we are at the opportunity our educator-occupiers gave Japan, and how the Japanese made the most of the V-J gift of democracy. Sure, they took advantage of our defense umbrella to leapfrog our economy; sure, they closed their markets and invited a trade war.</p>
        <p>But thanks to their good sense and our exemplary occupation, Japan is a great democracy and no threat to its neighbors. V-J + 50 is the day to suspend the sniping and join in wonderment at how -- a half-century later -- victor and vanquished are both winners. And to point to the day when a billion more Asians will be free.</p>
        <p>Remember the dead; honor the veterans; but celebrate victory by reminding the new generation why the war was fought and how it snatched freedom from the jaws of tyrants.</p>
        <p>Three months remain to invite the leaders of the world to a civilian V-J commemoration worthy of that victory.  ESSAY</p>
