        <p>AS a floral designer and master judge of flower shows, Barbara Novich tries to surpass herself when she competes in shows that she does not judge. A 28-year member of the Ardsley Garden Club here and a frequent blue-ribbon winner, she still gets a kind of stage fright as she readies her designs for display, aiming for flowers at the peak of bloom, greens that are lush and free of curl and an original grouping of accessories.</p>
        <p>At the club's recent 32d Standard Flower Show, for example, she used a sculptured wire teapot to unusual effect by filling it with roses, ranunculus, fuchsia and spirea. The flowers and greenery -- consisting of hosta leaves and pachysandra -- cascaded over a chair made of twigs onto a leafy green tablecloth matching pale green napkins. A wire teacup and sunbonnet completed the display, which suggested a scenario of stolen hours on a sultry summer day.</p>

        <p>AS a floral designer and master judge of flower shows, Barbara Novich tries to surpass herself when she competes in shows that she does not judge. A 28-year member of the Ardsley Garden Club here and a frequent blue-ribbon winner, she still gets a kind of stage fright as she readies her designs for display, aiming for flowers at the peak of bloom, greens that are lush and free of curl and an original grouping of accessories.</p>
        <p>At the club's recent 32d Standard Flower Show, for example, she used a sculptured wire teapot to unusual effect by filling it with roses, ranunculus, fuchsia and spirea. The flowers and greenery -- consisting of hosta leaves and pachysandra -- cascaded over a chair made of twigs onto a leafy green tablecloth matching pale green napkins. A wire teacup and sunbonnet completed the display, which suggested a scenario of stolen hours on a sultry summer day.</p>
        <p>"Lovely," a woman said as Ms. Novich put the finishing touches on the arrangement, which would be judged with three others in a category called "Secret Gardens." But the designer was not altogether satisfied. She had wanted to use "huge apricot roses," she said, but the flower shop could only find medium-size pink roses.</p>
        <p>"I have to have everything exactly so," said Ms. Novich, who almost single-handedly serves as Ardsley's official beautification committee, planting tulips and annuals along the village's main streets.</p>
        <p>Time plays tricks with floral art, wilting blooms that were in perfect form just hours before, Ms. Novich said. The competitor's challenge, she added, is to use materials that will "be good for the judges" in the morning, "but also good for the public the rest of the day."</p>
        <p>The Ardsley Garden Club show conformed to standards set by the National Council of State Garden Clubs. The club itself is a member of the Ninth District of the Federated Garden Clubs of New York State, which extends from Putnam County to City Island in the Bronx. Garden club shows have strict rules, and master judges like Ms. Novich rise from the ranks of serious students who attend what she called "flower show schools."</p>
        <p>The intensive courses, which are offered periodically, can take as long as seven years to complete, Ms. Novich said.</p>
        <p>Because both judges and exhibitors spend so much avocational time participating in the shows and at monthly meetings, the field has been dwindling as women return to the work force, Ms. Novich said. The Ardsley Club, which now has 19 active members, would like to expand, she explained.</p>
        <p>As a master judge, Ms. Novich said she has learned to temper criticism with praise and make each show a learning experience for all involved.</p>
        <p>Entries are rated for qualities like color and textural harmony, creativity and expression and overall design. Displays are not judged against each other but rather accumulate points up to a total of 100. An entry receiving 90 points or more receives a blue ribbon.</p>
        <p>Ms. Novich did not receive a blue ribbon for her "Secret Gardens" design. She placed third out of the four entries, because, she said, the judges found the wire objects hard to see.</p>
        <p>She was philosophical about what is perhaps the only art form that can be recycled as potpourri. "The achievement is it -- it's transient," she said. ROBERTA HERSHENSON</p>
