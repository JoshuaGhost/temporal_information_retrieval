        <p>ROBERT CHAMBERLAIN, seemingly well-ensconced in a 10-room "English cottage" set off from a woodsy stretch of road between North Tarrytown and Briarcliff Manor, concedes that at least six months pass before he starts feeling settled in a new home.

        <p>ROBERT CHAMBERLAIN, seemingly well-ensconced in a 10-room "English cottage" set off from a woodsy stretch of road between North Tarrytown and Briarcliff Manor, concedes that at least six months pass before he starts feeling settled in a new home. By all appearances, the 42-year-old Tarrytown native appears comfortably established in the rambling 3,200-square-foot, one-story house he moved into last September.</p>
        <p>His residency here, though, is temporary at best. The luxury home -- with each room attractively furnished and decorated -- is on three acres in the Pocantico Hills school district. It is for sale, and Mr. Chamberlain is merely house-sitting until the property sells.</p>
        <p>The arrangement is one Mr. Chamberlain is thoroughly acquainted with. In the last five years he has lived in seven different residences and, in exchange for reduced rent or no rent at all, has served as a combination house sitter and caretaker for homes on the market. A requirement of his occupancy, however, is that the house must always be clean and presentable, because real estate brokers are allowed to show the property to potential buyers whenever possible throughout the week.</p>
        <p>Recently, several factors have led owners and realtors to employ house sitters.</p>
        <p>"Fluctuating interest rates, high property taxes and a glut of higher-priced homes have softened the housing market to some extent, with the most effective properties being luxury homes, which are on average for sale or listed longer to begin with, and homes in less desirable or unfavorable locations," said Jody Toth, a saleswoman at John P. Streb &amp; Son in Tarrytown.</p>
        <p>And some houses, because of quirky structural designs or poorly planned layouts, are simply hard to sell. Or, more likely, owners need to recoup what they paid for a property and will keep a house on the market until a suitable price is met. Whatever the reason, homeowners are sometimes forced to move, usually because of job relocation. In corporate relocations, owners are often bailed out by holding companies that purchase their homes, and in turn list the property with a real estate broker.</p>
        <p>Because a vacant house or an unattended property can be a risk, the services of a house sitter are sometimes necessary, several real estate brokers agreed. Two businesses in Connecticut, incidentally, hire house sitters for their clients, who are typically realtors and financial holding companies. Show Homes of America, a Dallas-based company, has a branch office in Westport, and two partners, Mary Boehlert and Joanne Paone-Gill, have been operating Home Market Associates Inc. in Fairfield for five years.</p>
        <p>Home Market Associates has 30 to 40 so-called residential managers placed at any given time, and because it is a small company, Ms. Paone-Gill said, "it provides a more personalized service in marketing the properties for the home owners."</p>
        <p>Heather Hiltz, the placement manager and overseer of Show Homes of America's Westport office, said that a distinction exists between house sitters and home managers -- the people she contracts to furnish and decorate vacant properties. "Home sitters are either paid for their service or it's a trade-off -- the house is occupied, maintained and watched while the house sitter resides there for free," she said.</p>
        <p>Both Home Marketing's residential managers and Show Homes's home mangers pay rents that are 60 percent to 75 percent less than the average rent for a comparable property. For instance, one manager occupied a contemporary mini-castle on a hill, which is listed at more than $1 million, for $1,000 a month plus utilities and the cost of lawn maintenance. Houses selling for $500,000 normally rent for between $600 and $750 a month plus utilities.</p>
        <p>When Show Homes accepts a new listing, Susan Handee, an interior decorator, helps arrange the home manager's furnishings to create a model home atmosphere, which many realtors feel helps sell the property more quickly. Also, a Show Homes brochure says that with a home manager houses go for an average 10 to 15 percent higher selling price.</p>
        <p>"The model home has to be kept in a pristine state," Ms. Hiltz said. "Looking at the pictures in the home-decorating magazines, if you don't see it in those photographs, then we don't want to see it in our show homes."</p>
        <p>Dirty dishes left in the sink aren't tolerated, and the houses are subjected monthly to unannounced inspections, Ms. Hiltz said. "Home managing for us is like a part-time job," she said.</p>
        <p>Most of Ms. Hiltz's home managers are saving money for a future house, and others are building houses and do not want to be locked into a lease. A few home managers are bankrupts or people unable to pass a credit check.</p>
        <p>"I sold my house in Pound Ridge to raise capital for a business, and I was paying $40,000 a year in rent," said Dorothy Treyball, who started with Show Homes but works primarily with Home Marketing Associates.</p>
        <p>"I was used to expensive homes, and it was going to be hard for me to move into an apartment," Ms. Treyball said. "I had too many nice things, and I didn't want to have to sell them. I saw a Show Homes ad in Greenwich Time, and it sounded almost too good to be true."</p>
        <p>Obviously, there is an adverse side to house sitting: one year Ms. Treyball moved five times. "It's so much hard work packing and unpacking everything, even though I've gotten good at it," she said. "I really prefer at least six months in one location."</p>
        <p>Most house sitters hope to be placed in a property that won't sell too quickly. "There is a bit of an art to picking out a house that you want to manage," said Remie Smith, who bounced from house to house with his wife and two preschool children while he renovated a house for his family.</p>
        <p>Robert Svoboda, currently managing a property for Show Homes in Mamaroneck, said he probably wasn't going anywhere too soon because the split-level he is in "backs up to a boat yard." Also, across the street and in front of the house is the back wall of a garden apartment complex -- "not an attractive view," said Mr. Svoboda, who moved into the house last November.</p>
        <p>Another trick, Mr. Smith said, is to rent storage space. "You don't want to move all of your possessions into a house," he said. "So, we never really moved into each house, and we never got comfortable. It was like camping out."</p>
        <p>Midge Billingsley of Frances Billingsley Realty in Katonah said her firm does not hire house sitters. "If a house is priced correctly, we usually have an accepted offer within 30 days," she said. "So, the house will only be vacant for a total of three months, from offer to closing. Plus, any of the homes that are empty the realtors check every day."</p>
        <p>Still, many realtors and absentee owners would rather hire a house sitter than face the anxiety associated with unattended property. Elio De Cecchis, whose Tarrytown concern De Cecchis Realty listed the English cottage that Robert Chamberlain is living in, said that the agreement Mr. Chamberlain has with the property's owner, a New York City real estate holding company, "can actually save owners and insurance companies a great deal of money."</p>
        <p>Mr. Chamberlain kept the pipes from freezing when the electric ignition in the house's boiler malfunctioned in March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chamberlain is responsible for the heating costs, which will amount to more than $3,000 this year, and minor maintenance charges also come out of his pocket.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chamberlain, a landscape architect at the Glen Gate Company in Wilton and president of the Tarrytown Historical Society, once moved three times in seven weeks, hopping between Greenwich and Somers.</p>
        <p>"The transience used to bother me," he said. "But I've grown accustomed to it. I just call this my nomadic stage."</p>
