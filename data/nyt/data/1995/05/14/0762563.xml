        <p>LET'S get the Government off our backs.</p>
        <p>That has been the clarion call from the new, conservative Congress elected last November. And corporate America has heard the message. Since the Republican sweep, companies have been lining up on the starting blocks, waiting for Washington to fire the pistol and set off an era of less stringent regulations.</p>
        <p>But in all the excitement, are some companies jumping the gun and ignoring regulations that are still on the books?</p>
        <p>That certainly seems to be what's happening at Respironics Inc., a high-flying medical device manufacturer with a long history of run-ins with its primary regulator, the Food and Drug Administration. Last December, the F.D.A. found that the company was selling medical equipment without the proper Government approvals. But, even afterward, Respironics kept right on selling millions of dollars worth of that equipment, blithely disregarding the agency's concerns.</p>
        <p>That might seem like a foolish -- and potentially dangerous -- display of bravado, even in these deregulatory times. But Respironics has an ace up its sleeve: Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House and a prime critic of the F.D.A. Gerald McGinnis, the chairman of Respironics, is a charter member of Gopac, the political action committee founded by Mr. Gingrich. For his multi-thousand dollar contributions, Mr. McGinnis has been able to personally present his views about the F.D.A. in private meetings with Mr. Gingrich.</p>
        <p>There is no evidence that Mr. Gingrich, a harsh critic of the F.D.A., intervened with the agency on behalf of Respironics. But it doesn't take an expert on the sociology of Washington bureaucrats to realize that an agency might hesitate to go after the friends of a politically powerful opponent.</p>
        <p>Still, while it has taken no action, the F.D.A. has not backed off. Government officials said that the agency is continuing to investigate Respironics, and was recently made aware of the company's continued sales of the devices it criticized.</p>
        <p>The F.D.A. and Respironics have had their share of tussles in the past. After the agency audited one of the company's plants in 1993, for instance, Respironics had to discontinue a manual resuscitation product and revamp one of its manufacturing facilities. The product was later reintroduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGinnis has made no secret of his belief that the agency's safety concerns are overdone. "You shouldn't say 'no risk,' that just isn't realistic," he said to a reporter last year. "You've got to take an acceptable level of risk."</p>
        <p>Respironics' recent problems with the F.D.A. began last Dec. 19. On that day, the agency sent a warning letter to Mr. McGinnis. The letter said that one of the companies products, called BiPAP, was being improperly sold.</p>
        <p>The product had been approved by the F.D.A. for use in treating sleep apnea, a disorder characterized by the temporary cessation of breathing. But Respironics had made a number of significant modifications to the BiPAP system, all of which required additional F.D.A. approvals. Not only had Respironics not gotten approval, it had not even asked for approval.</p>
        <p>Worse, the company was selling BiPAP as a ventilating system that could help patients breathe. The F.D.A. letter said that Respironics had never provided the agency with any testing data or other proof that the machine offered benefits for any conditions other than sleep apnea. Essentially, the F.D.A. was saying, Respironics was selling BiPAP for unapproved uses.</p>
        <p>"You should take prompt action to correct these violations," the F.D.A. letter said. The agency asked for a letter from Respironics which would describe the corrective action it planned to take. "Your response should also include a statement regarding the status of devices in commercial distribution," the F.D.A. letter said.</p>
        <p>When the F.D.A. letter was publicly disclosed, Respironics assured the marketplace that the issues raised by the agency would have no impact on its business. But probably few investors guessed the reason why: Respironics planned to keep selling the equipment that so concerned the F.D.A. In the past quarter alone, Respironics had revenues of $6.8 million from its ventilation business, much of which involved sales of BiPAP.</p>
        <p>This business-as-usual approach hasn't hurt Respironics' stock price any. On the day the F.D.A. sent its warning letter, the company's share price stood at $11.625. The share price rose steadily afterwards, trading in a range between $13 and $16. The shares closed Friday at $13.50 in trading on Nasdaq.</p>
        <p>As ordered by the F.D.A. in its December letter, the company has made all of the appropriate filings, but has not yet heard back from the agency.</p>
        <p>Company officials see nothing wrong with continuing their sales while they wait. They disagree with the agency's conclusion that they need to file for a new clearance. Instead, they say, the original clearance allows for all of the marketing they have done, regardless of what the F.D.A. thinks. And if the F.D.A. disagrees, company officials said, then it hasn't said so.</p>
        <p>"The F.D.A. has not specifically told us to stop shipping," said Daniel Bevevino, the controller and chief financial officer of Respironics. "If they want us to stop, they can ask us to do that. We believe that we have acted responsibly and ethically."</p>
        <p>Maybe so. But, at least according to the F.D.A., the company has acted illegally as well. "By law, you cannot ship a product unless you have clearance from the F.D.A.," said Sharon Snider, a spokeswoman for the agency. "And the warning letter says that Respironics requires a clearance which they do not have. We are looking into the matter right now."</p>
        <p>So what's the message in this new era of law and order? Well, if you don't agree with a law -- and have political muscle backing you up -- just ignore it.  INVESTING IT: STREET SMARTS</p>
