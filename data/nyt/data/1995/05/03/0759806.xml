        <p>Ralph Fiennes doesn't make a star's conventional entrance in "Hamlet," but it's an entrance to remember.</p>
        <p>As the lights come up in his first scene, he's on the stage as just another member of the court surrounding Claudius and Gertrude. Hamlet stands to one side with his back to the theater audience and the royal entourage. Wearing a dark greatcoat, he's slouched and a bit atilt, like Rodin's statue of Balzac attending to a muse.</p>
        <p>When at last Claudius addresses Hamlet and he abruptly turns, the effect is that of a motion-picture close-up, something not easily achieved in the theater. The audience, having already seen Hamlet's silhouette, now seeks out his handsomely hawklike face and tries to read it. The audience is hooked.</p>
        <p>This quite startling moment is also emblematic of everything that follows in Jonathan Kent's slick, entertaining English production, which opened last night at the Belasco.  Here is a "Hamlet" paced to hold its own on Broadway, without knuckling under to Broadway's baser tendencies to soothe and stroke.</p>
        <p>Produced under the auspices of London's prestigious Almeida Theater Company, the Kent-Fiennes "Hamlet" is not one for literary sleuths and Shakespeare scholars. It respects the play, but it doesn't provide any new material for arcane debates on what it all means.</p>
        <p>Instead it's an intelligent, beautifully read and set production that serves the new star as much as he serves it. Mr. Fiennes, who slipped into our collective consciousness through "Schindler's List" and "Quiz Show," is in command at the Belasco from beginning to end. He's a charismatic stage actor. He has a fine strong voice (and complete control of it) that never becomes monotonously distinctive. He doesn't intone the lines with the velvety resonance of a Richard Burton. There's no suspicion here that, at the end, we'll be treated to an encore of highlights from Dylan Thomas.</p>
        <p>His Hamlet is utterly contemporary in execution and concept, even to the downtown manner in which he wears his Edwardian clothes. Seemingly unshaven, his hair lank, this Hamlet has an unkempt, layered look. The layers become fewer and fewer as he proceeds from sardonic, passive inaction to resolve and feigned madness. By the time he's brutally advising Ophelia to get herself to a nunnery, he's barefoot and virtually shirtless, his passion naked.</p>
        <p>It's a measure of the sureness of Mr. Fiennes's performance that he remains the calm center of a production that otherwise moves at sometimes dizzying speed. Only once is that pacing reflected in his own performance, when he comes on stage speaking the "To be or not to be" soliloquy so rapidly that it sounds like a madman's laundry list of options.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fiennes is the star, but his is not the only excellent performance. Francesca Annis, who years ago played Lady Macbeth in Roman Polanski's film adaptation of "Macbeth," is lovely and exceptionally moving as the ill-fated Gertrude. She's also the first Gertrude I've ever seen who seems less predator than victim.</p>
        <p>In this she's helped in no small way by Terence Rigby as the Ghost.  It's another revelation. His portrayal of the implacable shade of Hamlet's father suggests that Gertrude's first marriage must have been less than the idyll Hamlet remembers. The old king was -- and still is -- a tyrant.  Ms. Annis's Gertrude is clearly a woman liberated in her sexuality and her emotions by her union with Claudius. So much for all that Oedipal nonsense.</p>
        <p>Tara FitzGerald is the production's enchanting Ophelia, first seen as she crosses an otherwise darkened stage bathed in a shaft of golden light, her coloring and her figure recalling a Vermeer portrait. The doom of this Ophelia is the loss of a genuine innocent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rigby's Ghost is matched by his rich portrayals of the Gravedigger and especially the Player King.  The latter is a garrulous, cigar-smoking trouper who, given the chance, would talk your ear off but who pays attention to his producer.</p>
        <p>The other principal members of the cast are effective in more conventional ways. James Laurenson's Claudius is ruthless in his statecraft, but vulnerable when it comes to his conscience. As played by Peter Eyre, Polonius is not quite the joke most actors make him out to be, but he's still almost as much of a bore to the audience as he is to Hamlet. Damian Lewis's Laertes is a vastly more interesting character than he was on opening night in London. His affection for Ophelia is real, and his swordfight with Hamlet at the end has an intensity seen more often in a swashbuckler than in a "Hamlet."</p>
        <p>Mr. Kent, who staged Diana Rigg's Tony Award-winning performance in "Medea" last year, isn't a director to let the audience snooze. He keeps attention focused throughout, sometimes with bold cinematic devices, as in the Ghost scenes. Dressed in shining armor, the Ghost appears on high radiating beams of light, rather like an angry human embodiment of the space ship in "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," just before it lands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rigby's Ghost hovers throughout, not only visually in the early scenes, but also as the unseen presence responsible for all that happens afterward.</p>
        <p>The production is scored with Jonathan Dove's music and a variety of sounds, including those of the loudly crashing waves that isolate Elsinore.  As it becomes increasingly apparent that the private problems of the royals are a matter of public concern, the theater becomes alive with the sibilant whispers of the members of the court.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Davison's set design creates a labyrinthine Elsinore, a series of dark and chilly interlocking chambers, dimly lighted and seemingly at the bottom of a great well. The effect is eerie, removed from ordinary time. The effect is also far more intimate in the smaller Belasco Theater than it was in the cavernous Hackney Empire, the old music hall house in the North London borough of Hackney, where the production started out in February.</p>
        <p>The performance runs nearly three hours, including one intermission, but you aren't likely to notice time's passage. You might suspect that because of the speed, this "Hamlet" is skimming the surface. Not true. Mr. Kent's greatest sin has been to present the text with such clarity and wit that you feel guilty for enjoying it so much.  THEATER REVIEW</p>
