        <p>Scrambling to get his Presidential campaign back on political track, Gov. Pete Wilson pleaded with voters today to be "fair" in judging whether he committed a serious wrong when he employed a Mexican maid who was an illegal alien and then failed to pay her Social Security taxes.</p>
        <p>The Governor, a Republican who in recent years has been an outspoken advocate of strict immigration controls, argued that he had "never intentionally" broken any laws or regulations when he and his wife at the time, Betty Hosie, employed the maid 17 years ago while he was Mayor of San Diego.</p>

        <p>Scrambling to get his Presidential campaign back on political track, Gov. Pete Wilson pleaded with voters today to be "fair" in judging whether he committed a serious wrong when he employed a Mexican maid who was an illegal alien and then failed to pay her Social Security taxes.</p>
        <p>The Governor, a Republican who in recent years has been an outspoken advocate of strict immigration controls, argued that he had "never intentionally" broken any laws or regulations when he and his wife at the time, Betty Hosie, employed the maid 17 years ago while he was Mayor of San Diego.</p>
        <p>"I'm eager to put this issue to rest," Mr. Wilson said, adding that only last month, during a pre-campaign review of his past hiring practices, did he learn that the maid's legal status was questionable and that her Social Security taxes had not been paid.</p>
        <p>What impact would the incident have on his Presidential aspirations?</p>
        <p>"I don't think this will have any serious impact on my campaign for President, or my ability to bring change as Governor," Mr. Wilson answered, speaking at a news conference in the Capitol here, his first public appearance since the incident was made public on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>He added pointedly that he would continue to advocate strict immigration controls.</p>
        <p>"Those opponents of immigration reform who think they can use this against me to silence the debate on illegal immigration are mistaken," he said. "The voters are far more concerned with how the Federal Government is failing to control our borders today, than with who was hired 17 years ago to help with the housework."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson is expected to formally announce his candidacy by the end of the month. He gave no indication today that he was having any second thoughts about that announcement.</p>
        <p>Most political analysts say the incident has severely embarrassed the Governor and rocked his budding campaign. But few see it as a fatal blow.</p>
        <p>"I have enough faith in the voters that, if they are fair-minded and take time to view the facts, they'll put this in the context in which it belongs," the Governor said in analyzing the impact of the maid incident.</p>
        <p>Then he offered his version of the facts and context.</p>
        <p>He contended that at the time the maid was hired, in 1978, he did not know that the woman, Josefina Klag, was in the United States illegally. In fact, he added, he still is not sure of what her status was in the 1970's because she has refused to answer his questions.</p>
        <p>Further, he argued, at the time she was hired, there was no legal requirement that an employer check on an employee's immigration status.</p>
        <p>"I certainly never would have employed this woman if Betty and I had known she was in the country illegally -- if in fact she was," the Governor said. "And second, 17 years ago there was no legal requirement to ask about her legal residency, and we had absolutely no reason to do so."</p>
        <p>As for the failure to withhold and forward the woman's Social Security taxes, the Governor said he always assumed that his wife, who ran his household, had done that. He added that it was a "complete surprise" to learn that the taxes had not been paid.</p>
        <p>"I never intentionally failed to withhold Social Security taxes," he said. "That was a serious oversight on our part."</p>
        <p>The Governor's aides say the review of Mr. Wilson's past hiring practices was begun after Ms. Hosie called his office to say that none of Ms. Klag's Social Security taxes had ever been paid. According to the aides, Ms. Hosie feared that the omission might adversely affect Mr. Wilson's political future.</p>
