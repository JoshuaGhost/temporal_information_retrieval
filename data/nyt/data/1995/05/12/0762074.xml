        <p>Joyce Kozloff has forsaken Pattern and Decoration, the 1970's movement with which she has always been associated, for an intriguing derivative that might be called Pattern and Information. Her newest works, seen here in her 13th-solo show in New York, are maps: densely layered, lushly colored and so packed with detail and suggestion and visual treats that the eye hardly knows where to start.</p>

        <p>Joyce Kozloff</p>
        <p>Midtown-Payson Gallery  745 Fifth Avenue (near 57th Street)  Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>Joyce Kozloff has forsaken Pattern and Decoration, the 1970's movement with which she has always been associated, for an intriguing derivative that might be called Pattern and Information. Her newest works, seen here in her 13th-solo show in New York, are maps: densely layered, lushly colored and so packed with detail and suggestion and visual treats that the eye hardly knows where to start.</p>
        <p>Especially rich are a series of large watercolor-collages that evoke the long, inadvertently multicultural arm of European colonialism. "The British Were Here" constrasts the variously ornate and organized city plans of Cairo, Bombay, Madurai, India; and Dunedin, New Zealand. "Imperial Cities" juxtaposes the wonderful geometries of Rome, Istanbul, Vienna and Amsterdam. In keeping with map-making's golden age, which coincided, not by chance, with the Age of Discovery, Ms. Kozloff lavishes great care on borders, cartouches and inserts, often including fragments of reproductions of old maps and woodcuts, but also improvising on her own. The borders of "The British Were Here" alternate drawings of tiles with headshots of actors in Indian dress.</p>
        <p>Three larger maps in glazed tile -- fragmentary plans of Ravenna, Italy; Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Changchun, China -- are also in the show. These are part of "Around the World on the 44th Parallel," a commission for the library of Mankato State Univeristy in Mankato, Minn. The tile pieces lack the piled-on detail of the watercolors, but their colors are clearer and stronger, and their scale better.</p>
        <p>In all, it's a very satisfying exhibition, although not necessarily recommended for those trying to keep their wanderlust in check. ROBERTA SMITH</p>
