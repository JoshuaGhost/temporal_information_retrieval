        <p>Giving Young Players A Stronger Foundation  European Mozart Academy Alice Tully Hall</p>
        <p>The European Mozart Academy is a three-year-old, tuition-free, post-graduate school based in Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. It seeks to go beyond technique and concert readiness and give to a wide international spectrum of young musicians the kinds of cultural bases that normal conservatory training might have denied them. An assortment of its scholars, ages 22 to 30, have been touring the world with chamber-music performances. They came to New York on Sunday night.</p>
        <p>The program showed imagination and variety; the players ranged from proficient to very interesting indeed. Mozart's E-major Trio was notable for its relaxed musicality and also for its graceful pianist, Ellen Braslavsky. "Die Junge Magd," by Hindemith, with its quiet intimations of ancient modal melody, featured the ardent if still unfinished voice of Magdalena Kozena, a 21-year-old Czech mezzo-soprano. A fine young player in two post-intermission pieces was Barbara Fink, a German violinist.</p>
        <p>The evening also offered a new Clarinet Quartet (with three strings) by Krzysztof Penderecki. Its four movements manage to be both elegant and gloomy. Yann Ghiro's clarinet offered wide upward intervals by way of introduction; the finale is an extended meditation set against a cello pedal point. Ravel's Trio, a colorful foil to Mr. Penderecki's solemnity, served to end the concert.  BERNARD HOLLAND  IN PERFORMANCE</p>
