        <p>A judge ruled yesterday that ETAN MERRICK, the third and fifth wife of the Broadway producer DAVID MERRICK, is entitled to a divorce on the ground that she was abandoned by her husband -- even though they weren't living together.</p>
        <p>A State Supreme Court justice, DAVID B. SAXE, found that Mr. Merrick abandoned his wife in November 1988 when he barred her from his apartment on East 57th Street. Mr. Merrick, 83, had moved out of their town house in fall 1985 because he had difficulty climbing the stairs; Mrs. Merrick stayed in the house.</p>
        <p>In 1988, while living apart, the couple planned to adopt two infants. After Mr. Merrick tried to back out of the agreement, an appeals court ordered him to support the children.</p>
