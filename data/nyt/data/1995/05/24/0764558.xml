        <p>Over three decades scores of small public academies, including 46 high schools in the last two years, have opened in New York City.

        <p>Over three decades scores of small public academies, including 46 high schools in the last two years, have opened in New York City. In this series, all the new high schools are profiled, as well as notable older ones that served as models. Here is a sampler of schools using an array of instructional techniques, some experimental, some traditional.  Kingsborough Academy for the Sciences High School  2001 Oriental Boulevard, Building T7, Kingsborough Community College, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn.  OPENED: 1993.  CURRENT ENROLLMENT: 360.  PEAK: 720.  GRADES: 9-10; eventually, 9-12.</p>
        <p>When Anthony Sclafani enters his classroom each day, the wastebaskets are empty, the floors are scrubbed, the blackboards are dusted and a fresh piece of chalk lies waiting for him.</p>
        <p>"It sounds like a small thing, but it really helps the morale," said Mr. Sclafani, one of Kingsborough Academy's two biology teachers.</p>
        <p>Although the school's two buildings on the campus of Kingsborough Community College would be the envy of most high schools, it's not only the physical environment that boosts morale. The students and teachers have access to the campus facilities, from the gym to the marine biology center. College professors work with students who are interested in science, and they come to classes to lecture.</p>
        <p>Last year and this year, Kingsborough has been one of the most popular of the new small schools. It received almost 4,000 applications for 180 spots. EMILY M. BERNSTEIN</p>
