        <p>An Army buddy of Timothy J. McVeigh has told Federal authorities that he and Mr. McVeigh inspected the Federal Building in Oklahoma City as a bombing target several days before the blast, law-enforcement officials said today.</p>
        <p>The man, Michael Fortier, a close friend of Mr. McVeigh from their days at Fort Riley, Kan., also told the authorities that Mr. McVeigh confided to him about plans for the bombing months earlier in Kingman, Ariz., where they both lived at the time, the officials said.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>An Army buddy of Timothy J. McVeigh has told Federal authorities that he and Mr. McVeigh inspected the Federal Building in Oklahoma City as a bombing target several days before the blast, law-enforcement officials said today.</p>
        <p>The man, Michael Fortier, a close friend of Mr. McVeigh from their days at Fort Riley, Kan., also told the authorities that Mr. McVeigh confided to him about plans for the bombing months earlier in Kingman, Ariz., where they both lived at the time, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier made the statements to Federal prosecutors as part of negotiations toward a possible deal in which he may cooperate with the Government, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier told them the two men drove from Arizona to the Federal Building in Oklahoma City about a week before the bombing in a visit that officials said appeared to be a trip to case the nine-story building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier has denied that he had any direct role in the bombing. Nevertheless, the authorities have been intensely interested in him since the blast. They had questioned him and searched his trailer in Kingman and an adjoining storage shed, but had said they had no basis to suspect him of involvement.</p>
        <p>The offer of cooperation could be an important breakthrough in an investigation that has appeared stalled in recent weeks, with hundreds of Federal agents searching nationwide for possible conspirators. Mr. McVeigh and another Army friend, Terry L. Nichols, are the only people charged in the April 19 blast, which killed 166 people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier is not the only figure in the case who has had contact with the Government outside the courtroom. Federal prosecutors and lawyers for Mr. McVeigh have had brief, highly preliminary contacts, other Government officials said.</p>
        <p>At one point the conversation between the two sides turned briefly to a discussion of a possible meeting between lawyers for Mr. McVeigh and Attorney General Janet Reno, the officials said. But such a meeting never took place, and there is no indication that one is contemplated.</p>
        <p>While the Justice Department is willing to meet with representatives of any defendant as a matter of policy, it is highly doubtful that Mr. McVeigh could provide information that would lead the Government to sanction any kind of cooperation agreement in his case, since Ms. Reno has said she would seek the death penalty against the bombers, statements that were echoed by President Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier could not be reached for comment tonight. Mr. McVeigh's lawyer, Stephen Jones, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier's discussions with the Government began after he was subpoenaed earlier this month to testify before a Federal grand jury in Oklahoma City. Rather than testify under oath, Mr. Fortier apparently approached the Government about a settlement and made his statements about Mr. McVeigh in an initial offer of the kind of evidence he could provide.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether prosecutors believe Mr. Fortier is culpable in the case or could be charged as an accessory to the bombing. It is possible that he would seek full immunity from prosecution in return for his information, but prosecutors may be unlikely to accept such a deal from anyone with knowledge of the blast.</p>
        <p>The officials said that Federal prosecutors were unlikely to agree to any deal without closely examining Mr. Fortier's account because they were wary of entering into any arrangement now that might prove unwarranted if investigators find additional evidence implicating him in the attack.</p>
        <p>It was unclear whether Mr. Fortier provided the Government with any information about the possible involvement of Mr. Nichols or other possible confederates in what the authorities have said they believe is a wider circle of conspirators.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier's statements, if investigators verify them, represent the most important break in the ranks of silence of Mr. McVeigh's few known associates and would make him the first person to directly implicate Mr. McVeigh in the bombing. Mr. Nichols, who turned himself in to authorities two days after the bombing, told investigators Mr. McVeigh had said to him days before the blast that "something big" was about to happen. But Mr. Nichols denied further knowledge of the plot and quickly ceased his cooperation. Investigators, who did not believe him from the start, assembled what they say is a chain of evidence linking him to Mr. McVeigh and to the kind of fertilizer used in the bomb.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier's statements about a trip to Oklahoma City could fit in with reports from witnesses who said they had seen two suspicious-looking men at the Federal Building in the days before the bombing.</p>
        <p>Some investigators have speculated that one of the men could have been Mr. McVeigh, accompanied by a man the authorities call John Doe No. 2, who was seen with Mr. McVeigh in Junction City, Kan., on April 16 when he rented the Ryder truck used in the bombing. The elusive suspect has been the subject of a nationwide manhunt.</p>
        <p>There have also been reports that two men may have visited Federal buildings in other cities in the months before the bombing, but there was no indication whether Mr. Fortier had provided any information about such visits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier, according to others who served in their unit at Fort Riley, was one of Mr. McVeigh's closest friends in the Army. They lived in the same barracks for nearly three years, beginning in 1988.</p>
        <p>For most of the last two years, Mr. Fortier appears to have been Mr. McVeigh's main anchor in the high desert town of Kingman, in northwestern Arizona.</p>
        <p>Mr. McVeigh was known to have stayed frequently during his travels at Mr. Fortier's trailer home in a nondescript new subdivision at the far edge of Kingman.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Fortier's trailer that Mr. McVeigh used as an address when he rented a box at the Mail Room, a private mail drop in Kingman, in May 1993. Mr. Fortier also helped Mr. McVeigh get a job at the True Value hardware store in Kingman for a few months in early 1994.</p>
        <p>The more than 100 F.B.I. agents and other Federal investigators who poured into Kingman as part of the bombing investigation concentrated much of the attention on Mr. Fortier and his friends, as well as classmates during his high school years in the town.</p>
        <p>A slim, almost frail-looking young man, he does not appear in the teams and activities portrayed in his 1987 high school yearbook. He is, however, known to share Mr. McVeigh's fascination with weaponry, keeping more than a half-dozen guns in his home, as is both legal and common in Kingman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fortier is married and has a child.</p>
