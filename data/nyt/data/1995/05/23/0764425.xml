        <p>With the investigation into a drunken spree by New York police officers in Washington making little progress, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said yesterday that he was forming an internal committee to look into police conduct to avert similar incidents at future public events.</p>
        <p>The committee, headed by the First Deputy Commissioner, John F. Timoney, will consider new police regulations regarding the carrying of firearms off duty and using police supervisors and Internal Affairs Bureau personnel to monitor behavior at public ceremonies.</p>

        <p>With the investigation into a drunken spree by New York police officers in Washington making little progress, Police Commissioner William J. Bratton said yesterday that he was forming an internal committee to look into police conduct to avert similar incidents at future public events.</p>
        <p>The committee, headed by the First Deputy Commissioner, John F. Timoney, will consider new police regulations regarding the carrying of firearms off duty and using police supervisors and Internal Affairs Bureau personnel to monitor behavior at public ceremonies.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Mr. Bratton offered little hope that Internal Affairs investigators would soon identify many of the officers who pranced in the nude, harassed women, fired shots out of windows and pulled fire alarms and extinguishers in several hotels on the nights of May 13 and 14. Some of the incidents occurred just hours before a national police gathering on May 15 to commemorate the deaths of fallen officers.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters at City Hall last night, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said it is now clear that the officers who know the identities of the worst offenders are not going to step forward with the information.</p>
        <p>The Mayor said it now appears that there were more officers in Washington for the ceremony than were originally thought -- perhaps as many as 800 or 900. About 50 are believed to have been involved in the incidents of drunkenness and rowdiness, he said, adding that there is no evidence that any guns were fired.</p>
        <p>"The Police Commissioner is very, very anxious to use this incident as a way in which he can convince other police officers that they shouldn't behave this way," Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton said several of the hotels had withheld guest registries providing the names and room numbers of many of the officers in Washington for the memorial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bratton said not a single officer had come forward to report on fellow officers or confess, and added: "I would not expect them to come forward. The reality is that is not the way it works."</p>
