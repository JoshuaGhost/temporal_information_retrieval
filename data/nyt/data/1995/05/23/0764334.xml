        <p>The New York Open Tournament, April 12 to 16, was won by Pavel Blatny, a Czech grandmaster who scored a heavy 8-1 in the nine-round Swiss system event. Blatny was awarded a $10,000 first prize.</p>
        <p>The grandmasters Lembit Oll of Estonia, Zbyneil Hracek of the Czech Republic, Joel Benjamin of Manhattan and Peter Svidler of Russia tied for second place with 7-2, and each got a prize of $2,337.50.</p>
        <p>Blatny, despite his very high tally, had no easy time winning the tournament, held for the first time outside New York City, at the Radisson Hotel at Newark Airport. He escaped from several tight corners and was not demoralized by a crushing defeat in Round 3 by the American grandmaster Nick DeFirmian. In Round 8, he received a gift from Benjamin, who rushed into an unsound piece sacrifice instead of patiently building up an attack. Blatny coolly repulsed Benjamin's effort and won with a sudden infiltration.</p>
        <p>In the Rubinstein Variation of the Nimzo-Indian Defense, 5 a3 uses a tempo to obtain the bishop-pair after 5 . . . Bc3 6 bc. It is true that Black can, as Blatny did, exchange bishops with 11 . . . Bd3 12 Qd3, but in the pawn formation that is clearly observable after 12 . . . Qa6 13 Qd2, White has a good chance to produce an attack with an eventual e4.</p>
        <p>After 19 e5 Nd7 20 f4, Blatny was virtually forced to try 20 . . . f6 because he needed to shrink the white pawn phalanx before it threatened, by the direct 21 Ng3 and 22 f5, to become overwhelming.</p>
        <p>Benjamin impatiently tried to smash through with the knight sacrifice, 21 Nh6?! Afterward, he said that a methodical buildup with 21 Ra1, followed by 22 Ra2 and 23 Raf2, would have been the correct way to press his initiative.</p>
        <p>After 21 . . . gh 22 f5 Qe7 23 e6, Benjamin later thought that Black could probably have preserved his knight with 23 . . . Nb8, but that Blatny's Kh8 24 Bh6 Rg8 was unobjectionable. After 25 ed Qd7, Black was at least equal with a beautifully posted knight and the target of the ragged white queenside pawns.</p>
        <p>After 28 Re1 Re8, Benjamin said, it might have been better to exchange a pair of rooks with 29 Re8 Qe8 and activate his king with 30 Kf2. The game might then have ended in a draw. Instead, Benjamin took his rook out of play with 29 Rf1? and thus left Blatny in control of the important open e file. Moreover, he had no way to punish the Czech's stealing a pawn with 29 . . . Na3.</p>
        <p>The transfer of the black knight with 30 . . . Nc4, 31 . . . Nd6 and 32 . . . Ne4 not only defended Blatny's king position but also prepared for attacks against the white king.</p>
        <p>On 33 . . . Rg8, Benjamin should perhaps have defended against the threat of 34 . . . Qf5 by 34 h3 because Blatny could not have gone ahead with 34 . . . Qf5 without allowing 35 Be5! Qg5 36 Qg5 Rg5 37 Rf6! Nf6 (or 37 . . . Kg8 38 Rc6) 38 Bf6 Rg7 39 h4 Kg8 40 Bg7 Kg7 41 Kf2, which brings about a drawn ending.</p>
        <p>Instead, Benjamin erred with 34 Kh1, which allowed 34 . . . Qb5! with a gain of tempo. Now, 35 Kg1 Qd3! 36 Bc7 Qc3 37 Bf4 Qd4 wins a pawn for White. Worse yet, Benjamin blundered with 35 Re1 and lost outright to Blatny's 35 . . . Rg4! Since 36 Qg4 drops the queen to 36 . . . Nf2, while 37 Qh6 is finished by 37 . . . Nf2 mate, Benjamin gave up.</p>
