      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Shares of Holvis Holzstoff A.G., a Swiss paper company that is a takeover target, fell 74 Swiss francs, or 14 percent, yesterday, yet continued to trade at more than the price of 435 Swiss francs, or $362.50, that the International Paper Company has offered. The share plunge, to 443 francs, came a day after Intertech Group Inc., a closely held South Carolina paper and plastics company, dropped a competing bid of 500 francs a share bid for Holvis.</p>
        <p>Analysts and traders said some Holvis investors were holding out for an offer higher than International Paper's bid of 387 million francs, about $323 million. Holvis's board is urging shareholders not to accept the offer by International Paper, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., saying it does not reflect the value of the company. Holvis said there are no other potential bidders at this time. (Bloomberg Business News)</p>
