        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The obituary of Harry Bergold on May 19 and "Epitaph for an Ambassador" by Philip Taubman (Editorial Notebook, May 21) were deserved tributes to a diplomat whose reporting on Nicaragua, in the disgraceful epoch of Elliott Abrams as Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, shone like the proverbial good deed in a naughty world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bergold was sent to Managua to replace Anthony Quainton, whose own sin was his refusal to back the Reagan Administration line that the Sandinistas were hard-core Communist anti-Semites. Mr. Bergold, with his service in Eastern Europe, was supposed to know a Communist when he saw one and report accordingly.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Bergold did know Communists when he saw them and could find none in the Sandinista Government, which, when he arrived, was conducting free, internationally observed, multiparty elections.</p>
        <p>Against that background, it was surprising to read in the May 22 obituary of former Defense Secretary Les Aspin that he had dismayed liberal Democrats as House Armed Services Committee chairman by his "support of the contras, who were trying to overthrow the communist government of Nicaragua."</p>
        <p>Some of your writers repeat mindlessly the old Reagan Administration propaganda used to justify the brutal 10-year war against the Sandinista government, which surrendered office peacefully after a second democratic election.</p>
        <p>Whatever the Sandinistas were -- and are -- (and opinions differ), they were most emphatically not Communists. DAVID MACMICHAEL  Washington, May 22, 1995 The writer is Washington director of the Association of National Security Alumni.</p>
