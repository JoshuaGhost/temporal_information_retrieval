        <p>The memory of eliminating the Boston Bruins in four straight games after losing the first two at home in the Stanley Cup playoffs last spring still lingers for the Devils. The two teams will meet again in a four-of-seven-game series, beginning Sunday afternoon at Boston Garden. But the Devils are aware that Boston is now a better team.</p>
        <p>Cam Neely, Boston's dynamic right wing, is healthy, and the rookie goaltender Blaine Lacher is performing the same way Martin Brodeur did for the Devils last season.</p>
        <p>Unlike last spring's second-round encounter, the Bruins will have the the home-ice advantage. Game 2 will be played Monday night in Boston and the series will shift to the Byrne Meadowlands Arena for Games 3 and 4 Wednesday and Friday.</p>
        <p>Since this is the last spring for the Bruins at historic Boston Garden, most experts believe that the Bruins will be highly motivated to have a long playoff run. The Bruins won both games in Boston during the regular season, the last one by 7-2 on March 2.</p>
        <p>Although Chris Terreri won all three decisions at Boston Garden last spring, Devils Coach Jacques Lemaire has been saying that Brodeur will start Game 1.</p>
        <p>"Marty was in the net for 40 games and he's played pretty good all year," Lemaire said of Brodeur, who finished the season with a record of 19-11-6.</p>
        <p>He was pulled from Wednesday night's game against the Sabres in Buffalo, the regular-season finale, after allowing two goals on the first five shots he faced in a 5-4 loss.</p>
        <p>The Devils will have to pay close attention to Neely, who scored 27 goals. Neely is dangerous on the power play, scoring a league-high 16 goals. Lemaire assigned Claude Lemieux to shadow Neely this season, but when he addressed the question yesterday he called Lemieux's shadowing of Neely "a possibility."</p>
        <p>Lemieux has had success in getting under Neely's skin with his agitating tactics. Asked how the Devils would contain Neely, Lemaire said, "I know what my job is."</p>
        <p>Neely's line, which has Adam Oates at center and Mats Naslund on left wing, is the biggest problem the Devils will face because Bob Carpenter, the best defensive center, is doubtful for the first game of the series. Carpenter has been nursing a charley horse in his right leg for about 10 days.</p>
        <p>"I would say his chances are 20 to 30 percent," Lemaire said about Carpenter, who underwent treatment yesterday by Ted Schuch, the team trainer, while the rest of the team was given the day off. "The thing that I liked about him was that today he said he felt better than yesterday."</p>
        <p>Lemaire said if Carpenter is unable to play, Neal Broten and Jimmy Dowd will shoulder most of the defensive duties among the four centers.</p>
        <p>Another big problem Lemaire has is his team's ineptitude with the man advantage. The Devils had 13 manpower advantages in the four meetings with the Bruins in the regular season and came away without a single goal.</p>
        <p>"We will work on it, and work on it and work on it for the next couple days," Lemaire said yesterday about practicing the power play. "We'll have to find a way to make it work."  HOCKEY</p>
