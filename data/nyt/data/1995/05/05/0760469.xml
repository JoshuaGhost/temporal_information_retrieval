        <p>Rupert Murdoch won a big victory today in his two-year wrestling match with regulators as the Federal Communications Commission decided that his company was in violation of foreign ownership laws but gave it a clear road map for getting an exception to the rules.</p>
        <p>In a 5-to-0 vote, the commission concluded that Mr. Murdoch's Australian-based company, the News Corporation, was in technical violation of the law limiting foreign ownership of American broadast stations. The News Corporation owns 99 percent of the equity in eight television stations that were acquired 10 years ago and became the nucleus of the Fox television network.</p>
        <p>But the commission gave the News Corporation the chance to argue that a waiver would be in the public interest, and three of the five commissioners made it clear today that they believed the Fox network had already benefited the public by bringing new competition to NBC, ABC and CBS.</p>
        <p>The agency emphatically rejected accusations that Mr. Murdoch had deceived regulators when Fox asked for approval to buy the stations in 1985, even though the agency said the News Corporation had not disclosed the full extent of its ownership until last May. Misrepresentation and what regulators call "lack of candor" are treated as mortal sins by the F.C.C., and a decision against Fox could have cost the company its broadcasting licenses.</p>
        <p>In effect, the commissioners blamed their predecessors of 10 years ago for either not asking enough questions or not being clear about the rules. "We cannot fault anybody for failing to comply with policies that were not clear," said Commissioner Susan Ness, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>James H. Quello, also a Democrat, is the only commissioner who voted on Fox's original application in 1985. He passionately defended Mr. Murdoch in this case.</p>
        <p>"I for one was never in any doubt about what Fox intended, for one very simple reason: I asked," Mr. Quello said. "I believe then, and I believe now, that creation of a fourth network was a compelling public interest goal."</p>
        <p>Yet in many ways, today's decision reflected the same political calculation that the commission made 10 years ago: its desire to promote greater competition in the television market outweighed its interest in strictly enforcing a law to restrict foreign ownership of communication properties.</p>
        <p>The agency also made no mention of any possible need for Mr. Murdoch to restructure his company, in sharp contrast to a recommendation two weeks ago by the commission's mass media bureau. In that recommendation, people within the agency say, the staff recommended that the News Corporation be given a blunt choice between obtaining a waiver or slashing its ownership stake in the stations to less than 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch had bitterly fought any financial restructuring, arguing that the News Corporation would have been saddled with a tax bill of $200 million and slowed in adding programming for the Fox network.</p>
        <p>Agency officials also said the staff recommendation had included a proposal for a $500,000 fine against the News Corporation. No fine was included in today's decision.</p>
        <p>"This is a complete victory for Mr. Murdoch," said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, executive director of the Media Access Project, a nonprofit organization that has frequently been critical of Mr. Murdoch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch, who attended the commission meeting, issued an ebullient statement immediately afterward. "We are gratified by the full and fair review," he said. "The meritless, wild and malicious charges of some of our competitors seem to have been rejected along with their requests for punitive sanctions."</p>
        <p>The most dogged opponent of Mr. Murdoch was the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which refused to comment on the decision and said it would hold a news conference on Monday.</p>
        <p>The battle over Fox began more than two years ago, when the N.A.A.C.P. was trying to block Mr. Murdoch from acquiring a television station in Philadelphia. Arguing that foreign companies make it more difficult for members of minorities to bid for television stations, the group eventually forced the News Corporation to disclose that it controlled virtually all the equity of television stations that Mr. Murdoch bought for $1.5 billion in 1986.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murdoch thought he had resolved the foreign ownership issue in 1985 by becoming an American citizen and giving himself 76 percent of the voting stock in a company affiliated with the News Corporation.</p>
        <p>Since buying those stations, Fox has built a television network that broadcasts 19 hours of prime-time programming a week and has 158 affiliates nationwide.</p>
        <p>News Corporation investors began anticipating a favorable outcome on Wednesday, when the company's American depository receipts rose $1.75, to $21.25, on the New York Stock Exchange. Today, the A.D.R.'s slipped 12.5 cents, to $21.125.</p>
        <p>Commission officials who were sympathetic to Mr. Murdoch said the agency's chairman, Reed E. Hundt, a Democrat, had strongly supported a requirement that Fox either restructure or plead its case. But today he voted with the majority without protest.</p>
