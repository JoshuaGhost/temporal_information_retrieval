        <p>An Iranian official said today that Teheran would not keep spent fuel from Russian-made atomic reactors that could serve as raw material for nuclear bombs, raising the possibility that Teheran and Moscow are trying to make the deal more palatable to the United States.</p>
        <p>The official, Mohammed Sadegh Ayatollahi, who is Iran's envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, said in New York today that Iran would return the spent fuel rods to Russia, a move apparently designed to reassure Western countries worried that Iran planned to separate the plutonium for possible use in a nuclear bomb.</p>
        <p>"We don't have any use for it," Mr. Ayatollahi said of the spent nuclear fuel.</p>
        <p>Although American officials welcomed the suggestion by Mr. Ayatollahi, the Clinton Administration continued to insist that Russia drop its $1 billion contract to build up to four nuclear reactors in Iran.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ayatollahi is here for a monthlong global conference to extend the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the 25-year-old pact intended to halt the spread of atomic weapons.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher welcomed Mr. Ayatollahi's statement, which was made in an interview with the Associated Press, but added, "We think the entire nuclear reactor program should be brought to an end."</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher said at a news conference today that persuading Russia to drop the nuclear deal with Iran would be a major theme of the meeting next week in Moscow between President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>"We will be making the argument in the broadest terms, and will not ultimately be satisfied by anything other than the end of the nuclear cooperation program," Mr. Christopher said.</p>
        <p>He said that President Clinton would make his point by acquainting his Russian counterpart with "very sensitive information concerning Iran's true intentions."</p>
        <p>American officials say they have evidence that Iran has a crash program to develop atomic weapons. But Russian experts assert that Iran wants nuclear reactors for a civilian energy program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ayatollahi said today that Iran would do what the United States has demanded of North Korea as a condition for building nuclear reactors there -- that the spent fuel rods be turned over to another country for reprocessing.</p>
        <p>In addition, he denied assertions by American officials that Iran has signed a side agreement with Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry that would allow Teheran to purchase gas centrifuges -- sophisticated equipment used to enrich uranium.</p>
        <p>American officials say Iran could want such equipment for only one reason: to obtain weapons-grade material for nuclear bombs. But the Russians say that such centrifuges could be used to enrich uranium for use in civilian reactors. Even so, Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said this week that Russian officials have told the United States that they are reconsidering plans to sell gas centrifuges to Iran.</p>
        <p>In interviews tonight, senior Administration officials said that if Russia carries out its nuclear deal with Iran, they would much prefer that firm safeguards be in place to minimize the chances that Iran could develop nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>"We've gotten a number of statements out of Russia that the deal would make it as safe as possible, that it would take extraordinary means to monitor Iran's behavior," said a senior State Department official. "But we, the United States, will maintain a purist position. We're worried about not just the reactors Iran will get from the Russian deal, but the transfer of nuclear expertise that its physicists could use to develop weapons."</p>
        <p>Recognizing that Mr. Clinton might not be able to persuade Mr. Yeltsin to cancel the nuclear deal, Administration officials have strained in the last few days to play down the chances of a breakthrough.</p>
        <p>"At the summit, we don't expect the Russians to announce they'll drop it," a senior official said. "We hope over time our views on Iran's intentions sink in. We hope over time they see that the deal is too dangerous and that they're never going to be paid by the Iranians anyway."</p>
        <p>American officials say they are convinced that Viktor N. Mikhailov, the head of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry, is not telling Mr. Yeltsin the full story about Iran's intentions.</p>
        <p>"They are a very desperate and self-serving organization that is trying very hard to survive," an American diplomat said. "There is reason to believe that they are not fully advising Yeltsin on everything they know."</p>
        <p>State Department officials say the United States set up a special research group on proliferation matters with Russia so that Washington could circumvent the Atomic Energy Ministry and provide information on Iran's nuclear intentions directly to Mr. Yeltsin and other senior Russian officials.</p>
