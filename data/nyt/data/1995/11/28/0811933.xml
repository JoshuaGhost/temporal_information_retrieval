        <p>Two teen-age girls returned home from school yesterday afternoon to find their mother lying dead on the kitchen floor of their Brooklyn apartment, with a knife in her neck, the police said.</p>
        <p>When they got home at about 3:20 P.M., the sisters, both students at Sheepshead Bay High School, were locked out of the apartment on Kings Highway in the Midwood section. They climbed up the fire escape to let themselves in, the police said.</p>
        <p>Last night, the police identified the mother as Mary Barsumyan, 32, an immigrant from Armenia. But they said they did not know of any motive for the attack.</p>
        <p>After finding their mother inside, Ms. Barsumyan's daughters summoned a neighbor, Schlime Ganushchak. "They said, 'Someone killed our mother, come and look,' " Ms. Ganushchak said. "I went into the apartment. She was on the floor of the kitchen between the table and the sink. There was a knife sticking in her neck."</p>
        <p>Ms. Ganushchak said that the gas on the stove had been left on, and the police said the apartment appeared to have been ransacked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ganushchak said the victim was a home attendant, who had lived with the girls, 15 and 16, and with her mother. They had lived in a fourth-floor apartment of the six-story brick walkup for about four years after arriving from Armenia, Ms. Ganushchak said.</p>
        <p>But she said she could not understand why the woman, who was stabbed several  times in the body and the neck, had been killed. "She came to my apartment to drink coffee," Ms. Ganushchak said. "She never did anything to anybody."</p>
