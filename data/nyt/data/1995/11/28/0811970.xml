        <p>John J. Kaweske, a former money manager for Invesco Funds Group, agreed today to pay $115,000 to settle allegations with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he failed to properly disclose personal securities trades and other transactions.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. maintained in a complaint filed in February that Mr. Kaweske, among other things, deceived Invesco management and fund shareholders when he did not report 47 personal securities transactions made for himself and 10 transactions in the name of his wife, Pamela Kaweske, and when he concealed from Invesco managers and holders that he was a founder, director and holder of the ID Biomedical Corporation, a Canadian company.</p>

        <p>John J. Kaweske, a former money manager for Invesco Funds Group, agreed today to pay $115,000 to settle allegations with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he failed to properly disclose personal securities trades and other transactions.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. maintained in a complaint filed in February that Mr. Kaweske, among other things, deceived Invesco management and fund shareholders when he did not report 47 personal securities transactions made for himself and 10 transactions in the name of his wife, Pamela Kaweske, and when he concealed from Invesco managers and holders that he was a founder, director and holder of the ID Biomedical Corporation, a Canadian company.</p>
        <p>In the settlement, "there was no finding of wrongdoing," said Andrew J. Levander, Mr. Kaweske's attorney. After an "exhaustive investigation" of the Kaweskes, the S.E.C. "doesn't contend that Mr. Kaweske improperly received or misappropriated a single cent," Mr. Levander said. "Rather the essence of the S.E.C.'s case was that Mr. Kaweske didn't adequately or timely disclose otherwise perfectly lawful transactions."</p>
