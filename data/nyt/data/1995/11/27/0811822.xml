        <p>When a Federal judge ruled this month that New York State could not arbitrarily cut off payments to 50 severely retarded and autistic adults who live out of state, the decision was a salve to people like Lorraine and Myron Slaff, whose son is one of them.</p>
        <p>For as far back as they can remember, their twin sons, who are both autistic, had a compulsion to destroy things. But while Stewart usually wrecked his belongings, Matthew hurt himself, banging his head into walls and, eventually, into sharp corners.</p>
        <p>When Matthew was 16, he cracked open his skull and spent five months in Lenox Hill Hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Slaff decided that they could no longer care for him at home in the Pelham Parkway section of the Bronx. And after several New York group homes refused to take him, the Slaffs settled on a residential school in Rhode Island where Matthew, who is now 23, still lives. But his stay there was put in jeopardy as the state and New York City began to withdraw support for out-of-state treatment.</p>
        <p>According to his parents, Matthew is happy in Rhode Island, pursuing his interests in dinosaurs and trolley cars and going on field trips. And most important, he has stopped banging his head, largely because of a device that allows therapists to deter the behavior by delivering an electric shock to the arm or leg.</p>
        <p>When the payments for the residential program stopped in June after the state insisted that Matthew be transferred to a residence on Long Island, Mrs. Slaff was terrified. She said she did not like what she had seen during visits to the  residence.</p>
        <p>"I didn't know what to do," she said. "Do I take him home and let him die at  home, and maybe I'll get killed trying to stop him, or do I let him go to this place where I'm positive he's not going to make it?"</p>
        <p>Now Mrs. Slaff is relieved that because of the ruling, by Judge David G. Trager, New York State must resume its payments to the Rhode Island school. She  said she is confident that the state would come up with a better placement than  the one on Long Island the family was offered.</p>
        <p>When Matthew was under 21, the considerable cost of attending the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Providence, and living in the center's group homes nearby, was picked up by the Federal Government. But the bill for his care as an adult, $161,000 last year, has been paid by New York City and New York State through its Transitional Care Funding program.</p>
        <p>Since 1982, through the program, the city and state had split the cost of housing city residents who had "aged out" of placements outside New York State that were designed for children.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the Transitional Care Funding program was written into law, increasing the state share to 60 percent until Jan. 1, 1999, when the state would start paying the full cost. The law also set up a procedure for the gradual transfer of the patients to institutions in New York.</p>
        <p>But in October 1994, the city announced its plan to withdraw from the program. And in June, Justice Helen E. Freedman of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the city's withdrawal was legal and that the state was not  obligated to pick up the city's share until 1999. After that ruling, the state stopped paying its share altogether.</p>
        <p>Of the 108 disabled adults from New York City living out of state, about half were brought back to institutions and group homes in New York State. But 32 people have not yet been assigned new placements, and 26 others, like Matthew Slaff, have not accepted those offered, said Deborah Sturm Rausch, a spokeswoman for the State Office of Mental Retardation. The schools have been forced to absorbed the costs for these disabled adults.</p>
        <p>In his ruling on Nov. 16, Judge Trager, of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, accused the state of "playing a perverse game of musical chairs where  not one but many persons are left standing when the music stops."</p>
        <p>He ordered the state to resume making the payments until an "appropriate, available, long-term" placement is proposed and parents have an opportunity to challenge the placement through an independent review.</p>
        <p>Judge Trager pointed out that only two weeks after a letter from Gov. George  E. Pataki was sent to parents on June 27, assuring them that they would "benefit from the due process hearing procedures," the state's Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities notified parents that it had eliminated such hearings.</p>
        <p>The Slaffs, at least, were given an administrative hearing in which they challenged the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities's desire to move Matthew to Long Island. But it was an internal hearing, not the kind of independent review Judge Trager called for.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Slaff said that when she visited the Long Island center she saw people banging their heads against windows without intervention from the staff and a young man who pulled his pants down in the living room before heading into the bathroom.</p>
        <p>"I asked the staff why he was doing that," she recalled, "and they said, 'Well, the toilet isn't in the room.' What kind of answer is that?"</p>
        <p>In the hearing, the Slaffs argued unsuccessfully that the setting was inappropriate.</p>
        <p>So they joined in the suit that led to Judge Trager's ruling.</p>
        <p>In a tidy brick home in the northeast Bronx, the Slaffs' other son, Stewart,  rocked silently on the couch -- typical autistic behavior -- while Mrs. Slaff pulled out pictures of Matthew before -- and after -- use of the shock device. Before, his forehead and nose are covered with scabs; after, his face is clear,  and he is smiling.</p>
        <p>"He's not drugged up or in a straitjacket," said Mr. Slaff, 62, an assistant  district supervisor for the New York State Labor Department. "He laughs. He watches movies and reads books. He can live like a human being."</p>
