        <p>A Conductor Pushing To Make a Whole of the Parts 'Un Ballo in Maschera' Metropolitan Opera</p>
        <p>In Saturday evening's "Ballo," the Met offered its third Amelia of the season, Deborah Voigt. As with many of today's other larger-voiced sopranos, the singer's size is off-putting. But Ms. Voigt sings better than most of the others, producing a more secure, attractive and emotionally varied sound over a  wider range. She overcame the audience's demonstrative respiratory distress in "Ma dall'arido" and a conductor who had to be forcibly slowed down in "Morro, ma prima in grazia."</p>
        <p>Mark Elder, the conductor, often pressed and in general tried too hard to make things happen instead of finding the music's inner logic and trusting its momentum. Still, there was intermittent life in his work, and if he felt that somebody had to try to hammer a performance out of this improbable collection of parts, it would be hard to argue.</p>
        <p>The distressed condition of Francisco Araiza's voice -- almost everything above the lower mid-range sounded unbearably strenuous -- crippled his performance, and "Ballo" is all but unworkable without a sympathetic Gustav. Paolo Gavanelli as Anckarstrom had some good moments, generally at full cry, but he seemed always to be presenting only an edge surface of a good baritone; where is the rest of the voice?</p>
        <p>Heidi Grant Murphy, who has joined the cast as Oscar since the premiere, seemed to have wandered in from "Hansel and Gretel," but Dolora Zajick remains a serviceable Ulrica. Christopher Schaldenbrand as Christiano once again made a  strong vocal impression.</p>
