        <p>DESIGNERS may be used to creating elegant drawing rooms, lavish bathrooms and baronial bedrooms, but those who have participated in the annual Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club show houses have also applied their talents to a one-inch scale.  Their 16 miniature rooms, called "Small Wonders," will be on display tomorrow at Christie's, at 502 Park Avenue (near 59th Street), until Dec. 4, when they will  be auctioned to benefit Kips Bay. The rooms are expected to raise $1,000 to $10,000 each. A party at 6 P.M. will precede the auction; tickets are $60, at (718) 893-8600.</p>
        <p>This year's rooms include a Ferrari repair shop by Anthony Antine, a ski lodge by Richard Ridge and Barbara Ostrom's classical gallery (above), complete  with two grandes dames -- and a lap dog, of course.</p>
