        <p>President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti hints he may go back on his pledge  to the United States and try to extend his term past its scheduled end next February. He has also alarmingly reverted to the demagogic political style that  scarred his Presidency before the 1991 military coup that forced him into exile. That earlier performance, which included incitements to mob violence, planted reasonable doubts about his commitment to the rule of law and fanned suggestions he was not fit to run the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aristide's latest outburst, earlier this month, has already cost at least 10 lives and threatens to destroy Haiti's best chance ever at democracy. The United States, which sponsored Mr. Aristide's return with some 20,000 American troops, must now send an urgent message making clear that unless such provocative behavior is repudiated at once, Washington will be forced to cut off future assistance.</p>

        <p>President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti hints he may go back on his pledge  to the United States and try to extend his term past its scheduled end next February. He has also alarmingly reverted to the demagogic political style that  scarred his Presidency before the 1991 military coup that forced him into exile. That earlier performance, which included incitements to mob violence, planted reasonable doubts about his commitment to the rule of law and fanned suggestions he was not fit to run the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aristide's latest outburst, earlier this month, has already cost at least 10 lives and threatens to destroy Haiti's best chance ever at democracy. The United States, which sponsored Mr. Aristide's return with some 20,000 American troops, must now send an urgent message making clear that unless such provocative behavior is repudiated at once, Washington will be forced to cut off future assistance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aristide spoke earlier this month at the funeral of a murdered relative  and political ally, exhorting his supporters, "do not sit idly by, do not wait," and demanding that they "go to the neighborhoods where there are big houses and  heavy weapons" and help the police disarm the occupants.</p>
        <p>Pro-Aristide crowds began burning houses and hunting down those they judged to be too critical of Mr. Aristide, like independent journalists and even neutral relief workers and United Nations peacekeepers. In addition, police officers carried out arbitrary arrests and Mr. Aristide unconstitutionally fired and replaced judges he considered insufficiently vigilant. With this episode of  deliberately provoked terror, Mr. Aristide has shaken the fragile tranquillity painstakingly developed since Washington helped bring him back to Haiti 14 months ago.</p>
        <p>America's ally in Haiti is democracy, not any individual politician. If Mr. Aristide means to prove his critics right and destroy Haiti's chance for democracy, he should not have American help.</p>
