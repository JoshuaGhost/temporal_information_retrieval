        <p>MAYORS of cities are some of the unhappiest people today, perennially worried about new problems stacked on old problems, less state aid, less Federal aid. Most of them could substitute for the actors in a television antacid ad.</p>
        <p>And then there's Michael P. Peters, the Mayor of Hartford, Connecticut's capital city, who over the last two years has tried something really radical in  governing a municipality: Humor.</p>
        <p>In his first two-year term, Mr. Peters, a short, stocky man of 47 with graying hair and graying mustache, has firmly established himself as the Henny Youngman of the mayoral business, the city hall king of the one-liners. Some examples.</p>
        <p>* "Yeah, but nobody's speeding now," after listening to one more complaint of potholes in the streets.</p>
        <p>* "I don't either, that's why I'm giving it to you," after the recipient of a key to the city said he didn't know what to do with it.</p>
        <p>* "They're very discreet, we all wear fake noses and glasses when we go inside," after a visitor on a tour of the city mentioned that an X-rated movie house did not have any big signs to identify it.</p>
        <p>* "You give me a dump truck and I'll give you a gang," to a suburban group about regional cooperation.</p>
        <p>* "If I dislike anything, it's those 7:30 in the morning meetings where all you get is a bagel," after someone asked if there were any drawbacks to the job  of Mayor.</p>
        <p>Even when one of his little observations on the world around him falls flat,  Mr. Peters recovers quickly. One day he tried to loosen up a visiting group of Federal officers with a joke. No response. "I forgot," he said, "you guys never  laugh."</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters likes to laugh and to make other people laugh. It is as simple as  that. And in the business of politics, that is a very special gift, particularly in Hartford where there has been little to laugh about the past several years.</p>
        <p>Hartford, once considered the richest medium-sized city in the country, had fallen on hard times, finally escalating to the very dubious recognition by the  Census Bureau as one of the 10 poorest cities in the country.</p>
        <p>It was also a city in disarray. City managers came and went in rapid order, some toting out bags of money in severance packages. Meanwhile, both the crime statistics and welfare costs remained very high and the SAT scores in the schools remained very low, as did the occupancy rate in a downtown known for its many empty stores and some totally empty buildings.</p>
        <p>The politics of the city were about as empty as the stores, a clash of Hispanics, the city's biggest ethnic group; blacks, who were now in second place, and whites, at third, all pushing their own special agendas.</p>
        <p>Michael Peters stepped into the scene two years ago, a virtual unknown who had lived in Hartford for all of his 45 years and been a city firefighter for more than half those years. If he had any claims to fame it was as the resident  wit of Engine Company 15 and as the originator, in 1990, of the Hooker Day parade -- named, let it be quickly added, for Thomas Hooker, a Puritan divine and the founder of Hartford in the 17th century.</p>
        <p>Hooker Day centers on an annual fun parade, mostly of people in outrageous costumes, that Mr. Peters thought might help brighten up an increasingly bleak urban environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peters first decided to challenge then-Mayor Carrie Saxon Perry, a woman  perhaps best known for never being seen without a hat, in a Democratic primary.  He lost. But then, spurred on by a group of friends, he challenged her again in  the general election as an independent. He won.</p>
        <p>It was a major upset in a city where the Democratic party outnumbers a combination of Republicans and independents three to one. Mr. Peters had found an audience for his message that the city's problems were not insurmountable, that cooperation is better than political warfare, and that, maybe most importantly, it doesn't hurt to have a sense of humor, even in politics.</p>
        <p>The sense of humor was evident as soon as he was sworn in as Mayor.</p>
        <p>At the inaugural parade in Hartford for Gov. John G. Rowland, on Jan. 4, 1994, Mayor Peters was marching with other newly elected city and state officials, The parade suddenly stopped. He was delegated to find out the reason. He returned with the reason -- a jamming up of marchers -- and a quip: "I told them to hurry up, I've got cops on overtime, this is breaking my budget."</p>
        <p>Shortly after the election, he was in Washington with other newly elected mayors from around the country, each having a picture taken with President Clinton and Vice President Gore. Hartford's Mayor told the President and the Vice President that he would hang the picture of the three of them in his office, then asked: "Where are you going to hang yours?"</p>
        <p>He has had ample time to further test his humor in the nearly two years since while holding together a tenuous coalition of two Democrats and three Republicans on a City Council that has been known for years for its partisan ferociousness.</p>
        <p>Mayor Peters, however, has not played Falstaff for the Hartford audience. Rather, his humor takes the form of quick, usually gentle, one-liners that carry a message.</p>
        <p>On the subject of the Mayor's official car, for instance. For years, it was a Lincoln Town Car, driven usually by a police officer. A few weeks ago, Mr. Peters, driving a less-expensive Buick, arrived at a ribbon-cutting for a new mini-mall in the city's predominantly black North End and someone asked him where the police officer was. He said he doesn't travel with one. "I know how to drive. I've driven all my life."</p>
        <p>The philosophy behind downgrading the car and eliminating a driver was, however, a bit deeper than a quip or two. Hartford has a long record of racial troubles. "Can you imagine the Mayor showing up in a big car and a cop carrying  a gun getting out with him? What kind of a message does that send!" It was not a question.</p>
        <p>"Besides," continued Mr. Peters, "why should I have a driver who makes more than I do?"</p>
        <p>That is true. The Mayor of Hartford receives a salary of $30,000 a year, less that a police officer. The Mayor's job is supposed to be a mostly ceremonial one. He or she presides over the City Council but does not get a vote. Many previous mayors have moaned about a lack of power but Mr. Peters never looked on it that way. The mayor can get things done by leading, he said, by establishing  a coalition, by having programs. And also by spending time on the job. Mr. Peters estimates that he spends 75 hours a week being the Mayor.</p>
        <p>Over the past two years, Mr. Peters has attracted small businesses to the city, and even one big business: Heublein Inc., the giant distilled spirits concern that had taken its headquarters to suburban Farmington some years ago. "When I heard Heublein might move out of Farmington, I was at the front door like a Fuller brush salesman," the Hartford Mayor said.</p>
        <p>He has received national attention for a plan to tear down Charter Oak Terrace, a dismal and violence-prone World War II-era barracks-style housing project and replace it with better homes and an industrial park intended to create jobs for the residents.</p>
        <p>He has urged cooperation with the city's suburbs instead of going through a litany of charging them with forgetting the city and thereby contributing to its woes, and has also advocated more work programs instead of more social programs in a city that had a reputation as a welfare haven. He also supported the hiring of a private company to run city schools despite huge opposition from unionized teachers.</p>
        <p>On Nov. 7, running this time as a Democrat, Mr. Peters was returned to office by perhaps the greatest margin in the city's history, 9,664 to 1,619.</p>
        <p>His Republican opponent had dropped out and his only challenge was from Elizabeth Horton Sheff, a member of the council whom he had beaten in a Democratic party primary and who then ran against him in the general election as the Pro Hartford Party candidate.</p>
        <p>In his second term, the biggest question might be what does Michael Peters do next? Has he any aspirations for higher, and certainly higher paying, office?</p>
        <p>He does not indicate any, at least now.</p>
        <p>"I never thought of myself as a Congressperson, that can't be much fun, or as Governor. You can't ever rule out anything but this is the job of the century for me. This is an honor. I love to do it." He thought for a moment and then put it into the true Michael Peters perspective. "I've got a pretty good gig going here."</p>
