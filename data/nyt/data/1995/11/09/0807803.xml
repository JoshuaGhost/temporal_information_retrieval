        <p>NOT ENTITLED A Memoir By Frank Kermode 263 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $23.</p>
        <p>Aside from his considerable reputation as a critic and teacher, Frank Kermode, the author of a wry memoir entitled "Not Entitled," is probably best known as a former co-editor (with Melvin Lasky) of Encounter magazine. He is also familiar as the editor of the Modern Masters series, which, as he writes, he himself first suggested as "a series of short, very cheap books offering authoritative but intelligible introductions" to such figures as Freud, Einstein, Herbert Marcuse, Che Guevara, Frantz Fanon, Noam Chomsky and the like.</p>
        <p>Of this latter achievement, typical of what he has contributed to contemporary letters, he is justly proud. But for his role with Encounter he berates himself harshly. As he explains at length in "Not Entitled," he resigned his editorship in 1966 after discovering that money for the magazine came from the Central Intelligence Agency.</p>
        <p>He morosely concludes of his involvement: "As on other occasions before and since, I allowed myself to be involved in an enterprise of which I was too ignorant, persuading myself, against all the available (though admittedly doubtful) evidence, that it was honest enough, and discounting the fact that here, whether honest or not, was a world in which I was unqualified to play a part. The worst of it was that while I did not know that I was invited to play the part largely because I was thought to be safely inadequate to it, I could wake in the night and suspect that it was so."</p>
        <p>Such severe self-denigration informs a good deal of this memoir, which is roughly divided into three parts: one on the author's childhood, one on his years in the Royal Navy during World War II and the rest on his career as a critic and teacher. As a child he was a disappointment to his father, he writes, "being fat, plain, shortsighted, clumsy, idle, dirty . . . and very unlikely to  add to the family store of sporting cups and medals."</p>
        <p>As a naval officer he was given to bursts of insubordination that cost him considerably. And summing up his career prospects at the start of his civilian life, he concludes that his incapacity "at least to be able to surmise how very  complicated things are done," or "even simple ones" prevented him from becoming  a playwright or a novelist. "It was also emerging that my poetry wasn't up to much, so there was nothing left for me except to become a critic, preferably with a paying job in a university."</p>
        <p>Even the book's title reflects this habit of self-abasement, taken as it is from the author's description of what sailors do when they discover that the fines they have been docked during a pay period exceed the amount they are owed: "When that happened, an officer, or more likely his writer (the navy word for a clerk . . .), would cry, 'Not Entitled!' " Apparently Mr. Kermode believes that the demerits of his life exceed whatever rewards he has earned.</p>
        <p>Oddly enough, Mr. Kermode's hardness on himself doesn't make his book depressing to read. In fact, the section on his childhood is an inspiring story  of a bright young man transcending the expectations of a lower-middle-class family from the Isle of Man. The section on his navy years is a blackly humorous account of wartime shipboard life, filled with characters who made the author realize that Conrad never exaggerated.</p>
        <p>And the most arresting part of the career section is a homage to D. J. Gordon, the eccentric chairman of the English department at Reading University.  Of Gordon's scholarship the author writes, "His choice of Jonson's masques and the aristocratic Baroque theater more generally as his principal interests was very likely motivated not only by his taste for recondite and difficult scholarship but by the unusually intimate connection between these topics and arbitrary and supreme political authority, something he would have liked to have had himself."</p>
        <p>Still, a sense of the author's alienation echoes throughout this memoir: alienation from home, alienation from departed wives (about whom he chooses not to write), even alienation from literature, which he evinces when he takes modest credit for his contributions to what he describes as "ways of studying literature which actually permit or enjoin the study of something else."</p>
        <p>Intermittently, he tries to explain his outlook. He sees one possible cause in the status of his homeland as a dependency of the United Kingdom, not an actual part: "It is not surprising that some of us Manx who have made our lives  in England have had to settle for a permanent condition of mild alienation." He  senses another source in "a habit of deference" he picked up from his parents, "a tendency to irrational and premature compliance with the expectations of anybody who assumed the right to demand it."</p>
        <p>Yet the best explanation for his outlook may lie in another meaning of his book's title. When sailors were docked all of their pay, the "relevant entry in  the ledger that lay open before the writer was 'N.E.,' meaning, of course, 'Not  Entitled,' but decoded by the troops as a North-Easter." To them a northeaster was any overwhelming experience. "Sometimes simply to be in the navy was to be in a . . . northeaster that never stopped blowing," Mr. Kermode writes. "Sometimes it seemed that to be alive at all was to have been born in the teeth  of such a gale."</p>
        <p>In Mr. Kermode's lexicon, a northeaster comes to mean all death and destruction. He witnessed plenty of northeasters during the war, some of them so senseless that he was left with the feeling that "the dead died for nothing; I learned nothing." What may account for his mixed outlook on himself in "Not Entitled" is that for the generation that experienced the northeaster of World War II, anything afterward was hard to take seriously, even the pronounced deficiencies of one's guilty self, guilty for having had the luck to survive.</p>
