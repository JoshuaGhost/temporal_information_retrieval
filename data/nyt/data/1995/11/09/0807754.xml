        <p>Spread the word: The Stanley Cup champions are struggling. They are slow, look tired and are playing with little intensity. The Devils were so listless tonight, in fact, that they suffered a 2-1 loss to the Calgary Flames, a team with only one victory in their previous 14 games.</p>
        <p>"You can't win with the kind of effort we put on," a remarkably calm Coach Jacques Lemaire said after the game. "The guys are tired and I don't know why. They just can't skate."</p>

        <p>Spread the word: The Stanley Cup champions are struggling. They are slow, look tired and are playing with little intensity. The Devils were so listless tonight, in fact, that they suffered a 2-1 loss to the Calgary Flames, a team with only one victory in their previous 14 games.</p>
        <p>"You can't win with the kind of effort we put on," a remarkably calm Coach Jacques Lemaire said after the game. "The guys are tired and I don't know why. They just can't skate."</p>
        <p>The loss to the Flames means the Devils have just one victory in their last  seven games. Their record has gone from 6-1-0 to 7-6-1, and it appears that a shake-up might be on the way.</p>
        <p>"I'm trying to find a way to shake them up," Lemaire said in response to a question. "I'm really surprised at the attitude of some of the guys. A lot of the guys have been on the edge since the start of the season. Some of them seem  to be satisfied at the way we're playing."</p>
        <p>Mike Peluso, one of the hardest-working players on the team, had the one reason for the team's woes in recent games. "We're not determined enough on the  forecheck," he said. "We've got to get the puck in and get our legs going. We have six or seven guys who don't finish their checks."</p>
        <p>Except for one line -- the one Petr Sykora centered for Steve Thomas on the left and Bill Guerin on the right -- the rest of the Devils forwards lacked not  only intensity but also coordination in the attacking zone, especially during the first two periods.</p>
        <p>The Devils had only 10 shots against goaltender Trevor Kidd in that span, just three in the opening session. Apparently in fear of allowing odd-man rushes, something they did with frequency on the four games on the road before tonight's game, the Devils played with a great deal of caution, until they fell  behind in the third period.</p>
        <p>Yet, after one period, the Devils had the game's only goal. It was Neal Broten's fourth of the season and it came 7 minutes 1 second into the game, on New Jersey's second shot against Kidd, who finished with 24 saves.</p>
        <p>Broten's goal was the result of some good work and a shot from a sharp angle  on the left by John MacLean. The puck bounced off Kidd's glove and allowed Broten to score from close range in front. Broten was so close, that the Flames  claimed he was in the crease and demanded a review, but the video replay showed  the goal was legal.</p>
        <p>Cory Sullivan tied it for the Flames 9:35 into the middle session, after Ken  Daneyko fell as he tried to clear an awkwardly bouncing puck after a shot by Theoren Fleury, the diminutive captain of the Flames.</p>
        <p>Michael Nylander's tie-breaking goal came on a shot from the left circle that beat Martin Brodeur, to the far side after Nylander took the puck away from Thomas near Calgary's blue line and took off alone.</p>
        <p>Brodeur had 22 saves, only one or two spectacular. He has not been the winning goaltender since Oct. 19.</p>
