        <p>Staring down at her scrambled eggs and ham this morning at Roundie's Restaurant here, Joan Buckley said she would probably vote Republican in the Kentucky governor's election on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>As a retired middle-school teacher, Mrs. Buckley said, she does not much care for the changes in the state's public education policies that were passed in 1990 -- and as she understood it, neither does the Republican candidate, Larry Forgy.</p>
        <p>Poking a fork at his own ham and eggs, her husband, Delmar, shook his head.  "I haven't made up my mind yet," he said. "I just might kill her vote by voting  Democrat. It's happened before. But I just don't know right now."</p>
        <p>With their sentiments apparent if passionless, the Buckleys are typical of the divided and disengaged electorate this year in Kentucky, which the Census Bureau ranks as the nation's sixth-poorest state.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Forgy nor his Democratic opponent, Lieut. Gov. Paul Patton, has generated much excitement among voters despite sharp differences in the candidates' positions and the increased nastiness of their campaigns. Most experts predict an unusually light turnout, even though the polls show that the  race is virtually even.</p>
        <p>The current Governor, Brereton Jones, a Democrat, is barred by law from seeking a second term.</p>
        <p>"It has been a lackluster campaign," said Penny Miller, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. "There has been no silver-bullet issue to get the attention of the public."</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Patton conceded today, after an appearance at a center for the elderly here, that the race lacked a burning issue, and added, "I don't know if  that helps me or hurts me."</p>
        <p>Much of the lack of interest is a result of Kentucky's new campaign finance laws, which limit each candidate to $1.8 million in spending and reduce individual contributions to $500 from $4,000. The spending limits have cut down  on television advertising, leaving many voters unfamiliar with the candidates until recently. Mr. Forgy's television advertisements began running only last month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forgy, a wealthy lawyer who has run for governor before, has campaigned as a conservative Republican, opposing abortion and favoring lower taxes, less government regulation and a return to the methods of education that prevailed before the passage of the Kentucky Education Reform Act in 1990. That law placed greater emphasis on writing and group work in public schools. Mr. Forgy is running strong with farmers, religious conservatives and opponents of abortion rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patton, a former coal mine operator, favors modest tax cuts, greater economic development and only modest changes in the education system. He has union support and has won editorial endorsements from the state's two largest newspapers, The Louisville Courier-Journal and The Lexington Herald-Leader.</p>
        <p>In the closing days of the race, the candidates have used national issues to  criticize each other. With tobacco as the state's leading cash crop, Mr. Forgy has tied Mr. Patton to the Clinton Administration's talk about regulating nicotine as a drug. Mr. Patton has warned elderly voters that Mr. Forgy's would-be colleagues in Washington, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, favor reduced Medicare benefits to help balance the Federal budget.</p>
        <p>But the only real sparks in the campaign have come from personal attacks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forgy has said his opponent is part of "the most entrenched, corrupt political machine in the United States," and has called the Lieutenant Governor  "a tax-and-spend-liberal." With great relish, Mr. Forgy has reminded voters of the Democratic politicians who are now serving prison terms for their role in recent state and Federal scandals, although he fails to mention the state's Republicans who have been imprisoned for similar offenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Patton has accused his opponent of telling voters "what they want to hear, then worry about it later." He has also suggested that by not making public all his income tax results, Mr. Forgy is "hiding some kind of business deal."</p>
        <p>Both candidates agree that the main battleground of the campaign may be here  in western Kentucky, where Democrats are no longer the automatic favorites they  once were.</p>
        <p>The Buckleys said the shift toward conservative candidates followed demographic changes in the area. Older residents, like Mr. Buckley, who followed his parents' lead and voted for "whoever the Democratic person was," are moving  away or dying, he said.</p>
        <p>"And the younger ones vote for people, not parties," Mrs. Buckley said. "The  new generation is more receptive to change."</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Patton has recognized the need to stay abreast of the political trends. Tonight, at the end of his final debate with Mr. Forgy, the Lieutenant Governor peered into the camera and earnestly asked voters to support "our conservative agenda for the citizens of Kentucky."</p>
