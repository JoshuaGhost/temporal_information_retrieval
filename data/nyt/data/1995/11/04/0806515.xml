        <p>Christopher Renzulli is a 29-year-old lawyer who was sworn in as a member of  the New York bar in April. Under state law, he will not be eligible to run for judge until 2005. Yet Mr. Renzulli, a resident of Westchester County, will appear on Tuesday's ballot as a Conservative candidate for Bronx Supreme Court justice -- a job he does not want.</p>
        <p>"It's like a bad joke," said Mr. Renzulli, an associate at Fischer Fiden &amp; Norris in Manhattan who is a 1994 graduate of St. John's University Law School.  "The Conservative Party didn't even bother to call me. I've called them, but they don't return my calls."</p>

        <p>Christopher Renzulli is a 29-year-old lawyer who was sworn in as a member of  the New York bar in April. Under state law, he will not be eligible to run for judge until 2005. Yet Mr. Renzulli, a resident of Westchester County, will appear on Tuesday's ballot as a Conservative candidate for Bronx Supreme Court justice -- a job he does not want.</p>
        <p>"It's like a bad joke," said Mr. Renzulli, an associate at Fischer Fiden &amp; Norris in Manhattan who is a 1994 graduate of St. John's University Law School.  "The Conservative Party didn't even bother to call me. I've called them, but they don't return my calls."</p>
        <p>Mr. Renzulli is one of a handful of unwitting candidates who were nominated  for judge without their knowledge or consent by underdog political parties bidding for some presence in this year's races.</p>
        <p>The Democratic Party has such an unyielding grip over judicial elections in New York City that some other political parties have had trouble recruiting serious candidates. In some contests, the Republicans do not even field opponents, or endorse the Democrats' candidates. In the Bronx this year, the Conservatives nominated several party members they barely know, regardless of their eligibility for the bench.</p>
        <p>And sometimes, they are not even party members: Mr. Renzulli became a Republican in February. "I can only presume that they picked my name off some list of Conservative attorneys who once lived in the Bronx," Mr. Renzulli said.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Conservative Party of the Bronx, William Newmark, said that "someone on the floor" of a judicial convention in September nominated Mr.  Renzulli. "I would assume he is aware of our nomination," he said.</p>
        <p>When told that Mr. Renzulli would not be eligible to become a justice until 2005, Mr. Newmark said: "My number is in the book. He never called me."</p>
        <p>Mr. Newmark acknowledged that all the parties had drafted unknowing candidates to put a lesser-known party's name on the ballot or simply as a gesture of protest against an out-of-favor incumbent.</p>
        <p>When several Conservative candidates who had been nominated without their knowledge did not remove their names, Mr. Newmark said he assumed they had accepted the nomination.</p>
        <p>"In a perfect world, things would be different," he said. "But this is reality. This is how things are done."</p>
        <p>This year, there are 10 Supreme Court seats up for grabs in Manhattan, the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, and an additional 15 countywide and municipal district seats in the five boroughs. Although the number of candidates and party affiliations in each contested race is dizzying, the overwhelming favorite in each race has the Democratic backing. Many political leaders say a judicial candidate without a Democratic endorsement rarely comes close to winning.</p>
        <p>In one of the more closely watched races, a former City Housing Authority chairwoman, Laura D. Blackburne, is running for a civil court seat in southeast  Queens. Ms. Blackburne has the Democratic endorsement and won an "approved" rating by the city bar association, despite having resigned in 1992 after she used government money to buy a $3,100 pink leather couch for her office and other ritzy furniture.</p>
        <p>"She got a bum rap on that," said Michael H. Reich, executive secretary of the Queens County Democratic organization. "I think she is going to shine as a judge."</p>
        <p>Mr. Reich acknowledged that victory was almost assured for Ms. Blackburne, who is running against a Republican lawyer named Joseph Dubowski, a 50-year-old  trial lawyer with 26 years' experience, mostly in civil litigation.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Dubowski, who is seeking a seat on the bench for the second time,  several first-time candidates have been drafted by the lesser-known parties. Some had no idea they were nominated.</p>
        <p>"When I found out I was a candidate, my mother had just died and I almost had an anxiety attack," said Howard E. Liker, a 39-year-old law clerk for a State Supreme Court justice in the Bronx. "No one told me. By the time I found out, it was too late to take my name off the ballot."</p>
        <p>For decades, critics have complained that judicial elections in New York City are mere formalities. An uninformed electorate votes strictly along party lines, critics argue, rubber-stamping the Democratic slate of candidates, who are chosen by party leaders and judicial delegates.</p>
        <p>Because of that, many candidates do not even bother to campaign actively. Instead, most judicial campaigns are tranquil affairs with a minimum of mudslinging, fund raising and baby kissing. Judicial candidates are forbidden from revealing their stances on the issues; they can only trumpet their own credentials.  Even the people who interview and screen the candidates are first  surprised, then baffled, by the Byzantine election process.</p>
        <p>"When I first started, I was very shocked by the process," said Chia Kang, an administrative assistant with the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. "I wasn't born in the United States. To me, elections and democracy are the greatest thing that ever could have happened. I sat there and thought:</p>
        <p>" 'This is wrong. It shouldn't happen this way.' "</p>
