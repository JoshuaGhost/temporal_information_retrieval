        <p>A pleasant autumn breeze blew across the open field where the Sachsenhausen concentration camp once stood.</p>
        <p>Warm air wafted through the cast-iron gate that bears the cynical inscription "Work Makes You Free," past the spot where the gallows had been, between the barracks that had housed Jewish prisoners and were burned in a 1992 arson attack, over the ruins of the crematory and toward the granite complex where thousands of prisoners were killed by gassing or shots in the back of the neck.</p>
        <p>The buildings and ruins here are powerful reminders of the Nazi horror. But  the exhibits at Sachsenhausen, most of them dating to the days of Communist rule in East Germany, are incomplete and, in some cases, misleading.</p>
        <p>There are not enough guides to show visitors where Nazi guards committed their crimes. No work has been done to rebuild the burned barracks, and in the small library, no researchers are trying to answer the many questions that remain about the awful crimes committed here.</p>
        <p>At several spots, visitors are warned away from buildings by signs that read: "Caution! Danger of Collapse. No Trespassing."</p>
        <p>Estimates of the number of people killed at Sachsenhausen range from 20,000 to 100,000. Nor is it clear how many perished in the April 1945 "death march," when prisoners were herded northward as Allied armies approached. A new photo exhibition here puts the number at 2,500, but a sign outside says 6,000.</p>
        <p>Although Sachsenhausen is just 25 miles north of Berlin, Government officials cannot find enough money to rescue it from the state into which the East German  Government allowed it to fall.</p>
        <p>The Governments of Germany and the state of Brandenburg recently announced that the 1996 budget for the foundation that runs Sachsenhausen and nearby Ravensbruck, which was a concentration camp for women, will be cut 12 percent from its 1995 level.</p>
        <p>The foundation will receive $6.1 million, slightly more than half of what administrators say they need to maintain the camp, research its history and correct inaccurate displays from the Communist era.</p>
        <p>As a result of the budget cut, 11 of the foundation's 71 employees are being  dismissed. Under a policy imposed by federal and state officials, those who retire or quit may not be replaced.</p>
        <p>The town of Oranienburg has refused to open a bus line connecting the local subway station to the camp. Visitors who arrive here from Berlin by subway must walk for 20 minutes or hire a taxi.</p>
        <p>"Sachsenhausen is not a museum like the one in Washington or a monument in a  park somewhere," said Jurgen Dittberner, director of the Foundation for Brandenburg Memorials, which administers Sachsenhausen and Ravensbruck.</p>
        <p>"This is an authentic site, a place where the evil was actually perpetrated.  It is a place that horrifies even people who have read many books about the Holocaust. When the federal Government moves to Berlin in a few years, it will become more important than ever.</p>
        <p>"But we don't have the resources to do what needs to be done here."</p>
        <p>"Our exhibits focus on Communist prisoners almost to the exclusion of all others," he said. "There is no exhibit at all about the gruesome medical experiments that were carried out here. Our tour guides aren't all bad, but they're holdovers from the old days and are not qualified historically, linguistically or politically. And we have no historians to go through the flood of new material that is becoming available."</p>
        <p>He added that, "A lot of people in Germany, perhaps even the majority, think  that after 50 years it's time to stop emphasizing the crimes of German history and move on. We're in a situation where only a wave of protest can change the situation."</p>
        <p>More than 3,000 former prisoners returned to Sachsenhausen in April to mark the 50th anniversary of their liberation by the Red Army, and hundreds brought letters and memorabilia as donations to the archive here. Part of this new collection is sitting in boxes because no one is available to assess and catalogue it, and the rest is being only slowly reviewed.</p>
        <p>Masses of new documents, both from the Nazi period and from the postwar years, when Soviet occupiers operated a political prison here, have recently become available in Moscow. That lode is also going unmined for lack of money.</p>
        <p>Rebuilding the Jewish barracks that burned in 1992 will take up the entire construction budget for 1996, so there will be no money left to rescue other edifices.</p>
        <p>The Brandenburg official responsible for Sachsenhausen's budget, Minister of  Culture Steffen Reiche, said he is working to persuade federal and state Governments to spend more money. He said he also hopes to persuade the Berlin government to begin contributing.</p>
        <p>"It is a purely financial question," Mr. Reiche said. "Here as in America, we are forced to reduce our budgets. We are ready to give more, because we recognize our responsibility. But it is not fair to ask for major increases when we are in such a difficult financial position."</p>
        <p>East German leaders used the Buchenwald concentration camp, 190 miles south of here, as their central symbol of Nazi crimes. Senior Communists were imprisoned in Buchenwald, and the East German authorities created a myth that they had freed the camp themselves by leading an uprising against Nazi commandants. In fact they took it over as guards fled in the face of Allied troop advances.</p>
        <p>At Sachsenhausen and nearby Ravensbruck, the East Germans preserved very little. The East German Army even built a base at Ravensbruck, constructing a gas station, garages and other installations on the ground where Nazis abused and killed female prisoners.</p>
        <p>"It's a scandal that no money is available to hire researchers or historians  or even people who can just answer letters from survivors," said Peter Fischer,  who directs the Berlin office of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.</p>
        <p>"The document collection is in a terrible state, and most of the exhibits are still from East German days. As for educating young people about what happened there, which is the most important job of these institutions, that just can't be done with the money the Government is providing."</p>
        <p>"We aren't talking about a huge amount," Mr. Fischer added. "The real problem isn't money. It's a bureaucratic mentality that is irresponsible and heartless."</p>
