        <p>Much of the increased school spending in the last 25 years has gone not to regular classrooms but for educating disabled children, counseling and other social welfare functions, an economists' group said today.</p>
        <p>Researchers said the study by the Economic Policy Institute helped show that  schools handled many tasks beyond academics. Their arguments dispute claims by conservatives that regular school spending has jumped dramatically while learning has plummeted. And the study drew immediate criticism.</p>
        <p>Certainly, special education accounts for a piece of the growth," said Chester Finn, a former Reagan Administration education official who works for the conservative Hudson Institute. "But even when you discount that, the growth  in spending is very substantial, and schools have not improved."</p>
        <p>An Economic Policy Institute researcher, Richard Rothstein, disputed that, saying, "The widespread belief that there have been vast new amounts of money poured into regular education with no results is just wrong."</p>
        <p>In addition to fueling fights over school spending, the findings worried advocates for disabled children, who have already said that they are concerned about what they call slipping support for a 1975 Federal anti-discrimination law.</p>
        <p>"Our kids are not using more than their share of resources, when you look at  individual districts," said Jamie Ruppman, a mother in Fairfax, Va. "And what's the alternative? Denying them education?"</p>
        <p>Parents and superintendents in a handful of districts have begun disputing the amount they must spend on mentally and physically disabled students under the 1975 law.</p>
        <p>Schools in Westchester County, N.Y., for example, have questioned whether they must send children to a special school for the blind and disabled at a cost of $175,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finn noted that more children each year were being classified as learning disabled. "Once a child is classified, they have essentially a prior claim on the school budget before anything else is paid for," he said. "How fair is that?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Rothstein spent three years examining spending in nine school districts from 1967 to 1991. In that time, actual average school expenditures climbed to $5,000 per student from $687.</p>
        <p>When accounting for inflation through the Consumer Price Index, that translated to a 100 percent increase in real spending. But arguing that the index does not reflect the labor intensiveness of schools, Mr. Rothstein substituted a price index focusing on the service industry. Under that measure,  which Mr. Finn criticized, expenditures rose by 60 percent since 1967.</p>
        <p>Of the new spending, the Economic Policy Institute study found that 38 percent went to educate disabled children, while 19 percent went to educate other special groups, including vocational students or pregnant teen-agers in alternative programs.</p>
        <p>The study looked at spending in Anne Arundel County, Md.; Bettendorf, Iowa; Boulder, Colo.; Claiborne County, Tenn.; East Baton Rouge, La.; Fall River, Mass.; Los Angeles; Middletown, N.Y., and Spring Branch, Tex.</p>
        <p>The Economic Policy Institute, founded in 1986 by the economists Lester C. Thurow and Robert B. Reich, who is now Labor Secretary, received money for the study from the Metropolitan Life Foundation, an affiliate of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York.</p>
