        <p>Even in a partial shutdown of the Federal Government, there are winners and losers. This year, the winners include big corporations that are planning to issue billions of dollars worth of stocks and bonds, while the big loser is the  Treasury.</p>
        <p>Millions of dollars in securities registration fees at the Securities and Exchange Commission automatically dropped by nearly half today as the budget authority expired for part of the fees. With companies poised to save money on the lower fees, the S.E.C. was flooded with registrations for at least $65 billion worth of securities, 20 times the volume on an average day.</p>
        <p>By evening, the securities commission calculated that it had lost at least $9.4 million in fees, with a few last-minute filings still to be processed on Wednesday morning. One of the companies taking greatest advantage of the lower fees was the Chrysler Financial Corporation. It saved $1.1 million in the registration of an $8 billion bond issue that will be used for loans to car dealers.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the company, John R. Ferry, said Chrysler Financial paid millions in fees every year. "This was a way to save some money in those fees,"  he said.</p>
        <p>Companies have up to two years in which to issue bonds after they register them.</p>
        <p>The registration fees dropped last year for nearly a week when Congress was slow to approve the S.E.C.'s budget. But companies and their bond lawyers moved  more slowly then, so that the S.E.C. only lost $334,635 on the first day of lower fees last year, and about $20 million before the fees were raised again.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. has the permanent legal authority to collect a fee equal to one-50th of the value of registered securities. But in recent years, budget bills have raised the fee to one-29th of the value. When the budget legislation  lapsed early this morning, the fee automatically fell back to the lower level in permanent law.</p>
