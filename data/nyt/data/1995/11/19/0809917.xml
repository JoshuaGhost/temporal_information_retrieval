        <p>Roger Rosenblatt's article "See Dick Run, Again" (Oct. 1) fails on a number of counts, not the least of which is the acceptance of Dick Snyder's one-sided views as gospel. In his haste to praise Snyder, Rosenblatt never contacted me, even though my accessibility to the press is well known.</p>
        <p>Snyder has become a master at rewriting history. For example, neither I nor any of our management teams recalls his proposal that we acquire Lippincott. The Pergamon Press "story" is pure fabrication. Our initial internal discussion of an offer of $600 million was increased, and Snyder did indeed have authorization to offer $750 million, a figure that was not low-balled by me or by anyone else. When I negotiated with the infamous Robert Maxwell to try and conclude the deal, he raised his demand to $850 million, but we were not about to play his game.</p>

        <p>Snyder has become a master at rewriting history. For example, neither I nor any of our management teams recalls his proposal that we acquire Lippincott.

        <p>With respect to Paramount having "a need to sell," nothing could be further  from the truth. The primary objective of the board of directors and management during the period from Charles Bluhdorn's death to the sale to Viacom was to enhance shareholder value. We did that spectacularly in that 10-year period, when the stock soared from $5.75 to more than $80 per share.</p>
        <p>Snyder's largely self-proclaimed brilliance as a publisher neglected to note  a number of blemishes on his record. Among them: In 1989, Paramount unexpectedly had to write off some $140 million in the publishing group as a result of bad calls by Snyder. This was a major alert requiring immediate changes in the publishing group's management and systems. Soon after, we recruited Jonathan Newcomb (Snyder's successor) from McGraw-Hill to implement the changes we deemed necessary. When Newcomb assumed the title of chairman of Simon &amp; Schuster, the group didn't miss a beat.</p>
        <p>Finally, contrary to Rosenblatt's comments, I did not hate Snyder. If anything, I indulged him too much. Frank Biondi was accurate in his assessment that Snyder was not a "team player." His performance did not match his ego.</p>
