        <p>International 3-14</p>
        <p>CONFLICTING VISIONS IN ISRAEL</p>
        <p>Divisions in Israel over the essence of the Jewish state are shown in the rapid growth of a religious movement, and it is clear that the Prime Minister's  assassination grew out of these divisions.  1</p>
        <p>In Israel, a suspect was said to be a security informer.  13</p>
        <p>RULING AGAINST WOMEN PRIESTS</p>
        <p>A Vatican statement added the word "infallible" to the ban on women as priests, seemingly strengthening it, but it also opened the way for new debate.  1</p>
        <p>INFLAMMATORY WORDS IN HAITI</p>
        <p>An emotional outburst at a funeral by Haiti's President has caused panic among the country's elite and undermined relations with other countries.  1</p>
        <p>BOSNIA DEMAND FOR PARITY</p>
        <p>Peace talks were tense as the Bosnian Government asked the United States to provide support to insure military parity with the Bosnian Serbs, an issue considered a major stumbling block.  10</p>
        <p>PLANNING FOR BOSNIA PEACE</p>
        <p>Within weeks after a Bosnia peace agreement, peacekeepers will start arriving, and more than any military operation since the Persian Gulf war, logistics will determine its initial success.  10</p>
        <p>A Western look for Poland's former Communist candidate.  4</p>
        <p>As Asian leaders gather in Osaka, protecting a city's image.  14</p>

        <p>In Kashmir, a political and hostage standoff continues.  6</p>
        <p>National 18-40</p>
        <p>BUDGET DEADLOCK CONTINUES</p>
        <p>Despite signs that Congress and President Clinton were making progress on reopening Government offices, neither side reported getting any closer to an official agreement.  1</p>
        <p>CLINTON'S BUDGET PROPOSAL</p>
        <p>As President Clinton prepares to veto the budget-balancing bill, Administration officials are completing proposals to achieve a similar goal while protecting programs for poor and elderly people.  1</p>
        <p>THOSE SCRAPPY REPRESENTATIVES</p>
        <p>These are mean, scrappy days in the House -- in part because of the raw animosities that have flourished over the course of a bitter year, and in part because of cold-blooded political strategy.  20</p>
        <p>DOLE WINS STRAW POLL</p>
        <p>Senator Bob Dole won the Florida Republican straw poll, but a close finish could be a sign of a hard-fought primary season ahead.  30</p>
        <p>TIMETABLE FOR ELECTRIC CARS</p>
        <p>California might back away from rules requiring that 2 percent of the cars sold in the state be powered by electricity two years from now.  25</p>
        <p>TROUBLED FOSTER CARE SYSTEM</p>
        <p>Officials who preside over the nation's foster care programs said that an already overburdened system would be flooded by refugees under the proposed restructuring of welfare.  1</p>
        <p>FIGHTING NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP</p>
        <p>In the eastern Mohave Desert, a group of environmental guerrillas wants to stop a low-level nuclear waste dump.  18</p>
        <p>OVERALL CRIME RATE DROPS</p>
        <p>The nation's overall crime rate dropped 2 percent in 1994, the third consecutive year it has fallen, with a 4 percent decrease in the rate of violent crimes, a report says.  18</p>
        <p>SPACE SHUTTLES UNDOCK</p>
        <p>The crew members of the shuttle Atlantis and the Russian space station Mir returned to routine tasks after the spacecraft uncoupled.  19</p>
        <p>EXAMINING POLICE CORRUPTION</p>
        <p>At a conference, prosecutors, judges and police officers looked at police corruption in Philadelphia, New York and New Orleans.  33</p>
        <p>Metro 41-50</p>
        <p>MAYORAL AGENDA LAID BARE</p>
        <p>By agreeing to unusually long labor contracts this month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani did more than simply secure labor peace through the next century. He has now emphatically revealed how he will overhaul government, and how he will not.  1</p>
        <p>THE ORTHODOX DIVIDED</p>
        <p>Vilified from the outside as provocateurs of Yitzhak Rabin's assassination and roiled from within by self-examination, the Orthodox Jewish community has been profoundly shaken by the slaying and divided over how to respond.  41</p>
        <p>BOLSTERED BY TOBACCO</p>
        <p>Representatives Edolphus Towns and Charles B. Rangel, black politicians who represent largely black districts in New York City, might appear to be unlikely  candidates to accept the tobacco industry's largesse. But they are among the House of Representatives' top 20 recipients of tobacco money.  41</p>
        <p>PROFITING FROM HUMAN CARGO</p>
        <p>In the 29 months since the Golden Venture ran aground off New York City with  its cargo of illegal Asian immigrants, the operation's accused mastermind, who was arrested in Thailand on Friday, has apparently continued to enjoy the vast profits of the human smuggling trade, investigators said.  41</p>
