        <p>COOLIO: 'GANGSTA'S PARADISE' Tommy Boy</p>
        <p>Violence was ubiquitous on Coolio's first album, "Fantastic Voyage," though he found a way to party anyway. On its successor, "Gangsta's Paradise," he's more disturbed by what he sees in the ghetto, a place he loves and hates.</p>
        <p>Coolio still builds his raps on recognizable 1970's oldies, and he delivers  intricate, syncopated rhymes as if they were conversation. But he has a new-found sense of responsibility. The album's title track has already sold 1.5  million copies as a single; using the somber minor chords of Stevie Wonder's "Pastime Paradise," it's the tale of a gangster with no way out, as the chorus intones, "The ones we hurt are you and me." In other raps, Coolio greets his newborn child, praises black women, parties and enjoys some romance. Repeatedly, he vows to defend himself but wishes he didn't have to: "I've been trying to live in peace, but these fools won't cease and desist."</p>
