        <p>Scott Edelman's article "Colleges Can Take Action Against Agents" (The Times, Oct. 15) raises some important issues concerning unscrupulous agents who solicit and tender gifts to student-athletes and the effect of such conduct on their eligibility.

        <p>Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement between the N.F.L. Players Association and the N.F.L., the N.F.L.P.A. has the power to certify all agents who represent players in individual contract negotiations with N.F.L. clubs. The N.F.L.P.A. would certainly have the power to deny certification to any agent who was found to have imperiled the eligibility of any student-athlete in the manner described in Edlelman's article.</p>
