While others applied the principles of modernism to the craft of precious stones -- streamlining the shapes, creating "abstract" settings -- Schlumberger resolutely pursued his own course, a serendipitous parade of flora, fauna and everyday objects.

        <p>The jellyfish's domelike, phosphorescent surface is perfectly rendered in moonstones interspersed with tiny diamonds; its curling gold tentacles, paved with amethysts, dangle below.

While others applied the principles of modernism to the craft of precious stones -- streamlining the shapes, creating "abstract" settings -- Schlumberger resolutely pursued his own course, a serendipitous parade of flora, fauna and everyday objects. Surprisingly, it is the sleek art-deco necklace from Cartier that now looks dated and conventional and Schlumberger's brooch of a giant ruby pierced by gold arrows that has proved to be not only timeless but subversive.</p>
        <p>He was an unlikely revolutionary. Born in 1907, in Alsace, to a well-to-do family of textile manufacturers, he defied his mother's warning that by becoming a jewelry designer, he would forfeit the right to dance with his clients. When he worked, he wore a smock made for him by Balenciaga, the great couturier and a friend. From 1956 until his retirement, in the late 70's, he was ensconced at Tiffany &amp; Co., in New York.</p>
        <p>He deplored the flatness of most jewelry, designing in three dimensions. He  abhorred the idea that the value of a piece was the monetary worth of its stones, protesting that he "might as well pin a check to someone's lapel." Whereas most precious jewelry conjures up ballrooms and opera houses, a rarefied world whose inhabitants are acquainted with the great outdoors by reputation only, Schlumberger's work pays homage to the wonders of nature: hand-chased gold tulips, diamond bees, ruby-eyed catfish. Waging a campaign against jewelry-as-status-symbol -- the family heirloom, the love trophy -- he created jewelry that can afford to make fun of its own importance, suggesting that the ultimate luxury may be a sense of humor. Among the sketches on display is one for a pair of earrings: the right, a devil; the left, an angel. Each whispers his encouragement in the ear of the woman who wears them, as she hesitates, torn between virtue and sin.</p>
