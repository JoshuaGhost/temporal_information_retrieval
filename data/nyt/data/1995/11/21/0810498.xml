        <p>The National Highway System bill that Congress passed last weekend was called a compromise between the Senate and House. It was less compromise than cave-in by the Senate, which acquiesced on highway billboard blight, safety and the distribution of precious dollars.</p>
        <p>There was no contest over the bill's original purpose, to designate 161,000 miles of roads as the nation's prime routes, freeing more than $6 billion in Federal construction funds. The two bodies also never disagreed about letting states set their own speed limits and decide whether to require motorcyclists to wear helmets.</p>

        <p>The National Highway System bill that Congress passed last weekend was called a compromise between the Senate and House. It was less compromise than cave-in by the Senate, which acquiesced on highway billboard blight, safety and the distribution of precious dollars.</p>
        <p>There was no contest over the bill's original purpose, to designate 161,000 miles of roads as the nation's prime routes, freeing more than $6 billion in Federal construction funds. The two bodies also never disagreed about letting states set their own speed limits and decide whether to require motorcyclists to wear helmets.</p>
        <p>But then the House, which had already yielded much to highway advertising, trucking and construction interests, prevailed on every significant issue.</p>
        <p>Senate negotiators went along with a House proposal to disfigure "scenic" highways by letting states build new billboards on commercial or industrial segments. They won one small, meaningless concession, language asserting that the Transportation Department retains power to prevent deliberate evasions of the scenic byway statute.</p>
        <p>The House -- which held no hearings on the matter -- embraced a program to exclude thousands of trucks weighing up to 13 tons, and their drivers, from Federal safety testing, inspection and record-keeping requirements. The Snack Food Association, a lobbyist for companies that use midsize trucks to deliver food products, settled for a "pilot program" rather than a blanket exemption. But the program has no termination date and, unlike most experimental projects,  seems headed for permanent status. The Senate, which had no such provision, surrendered.</p>
        <p>The Senate had voted 64 to 36 to give states leeway to allocate a little highway money to Amtrak, the passenger railroad. Many state governors, including Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, pleaded for this power to balance their highway-dominated transportation systems. Nothing doing, said Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee. The Senate obliged him.</p>
        <p>Senator John Chafee of Rhode Island, chairman of the Transportation Committee, bestowed high praise on his chief negotiator, John Warner of Virginia, but explained that the House simply wouldn't budge. Mr. Warner said he had stood up to Mr. Shuster, and "neither of us blinked."</p>
        <p>That is correct. The Senate capitulated -- without batting an eye.</p>
