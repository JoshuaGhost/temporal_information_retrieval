        <p>A man distraught over being dismissed from his job at a bank fatally shot four people and wounded two others in homes he broke into on Sunday night, the police said.</p>
        <p>Two of the dead and two of the wounded were bank employees. When the man, Jerry Hessler, burst in on his former girlfriend -- the fourth stop on the shooting rampage -- her husband shot him, the police said. But Mr. Hessler was wearing a bulletproof vest and the authorities said he was not seriously injured. Officers later caught him as he was trying to flee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hessler, 38, was upset about his dismissal in October 1994 from Bank One, where he had been accused of sexual harassment, Sgt. Jim Longebone of the Columbus Police Department said. A Bank One spokesman, John Russell, declined to discuss what had led up to Mr. Hessler's departure, but he said that "there must have been" trouble between Mr. Hessler and the victims.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Longebone said Mr. Hessler had first broken into a Columbus home and killed Brian Stevens, 36, a bank employee; his wife, Tracy Stevens, 25, also a bank employee, and their 4-month-old daughter, Amanda. Another bank employee who was visiting, Ruth Canter, 33, was wounded, and a 7-year-old boy hid and escaped injury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russell said that bank officials had recent indications, which he declined to disclose, that someone was "showing aggravation" toward Mrs. Stevens. They offered to provide her with security between home and work, but she declined, saying she would take the matter to the police today, Mr. Russell  said.</p>
        <p>After leaving the Stevens home, Mr. Hessler went to a home about a half-mile  away and shot Mark P. Campolito, 27, another bank employee, in the left arm, Sergeant Longebone said. Mr. Campolito was hospitalized in fair condition.</p>
        <p>At a home in the suburb of Worthington, Mr. Hessler killed P. Thane Griffin,  64, who had recently retired as a charity executive.</p>
        <p>After the killings, Mr. Hessler drove 70 miles northeast to the home of his former girlfriend, Judy Stanton, 38, in Ashland, said Lieut. Steve Rush of the Ashland police.</p>
        <p>When he was refused entry, Mr. Hessler fired three shots through the door and kicked it open, Lieutenant Rush said. Mrs. Stanton's husband, Douglas, 38, shot  Mr. Hessler in the chest, but Mr. Hessler was wearing a bulletproof vest and received only minor injuries, Lieutenant Rush said. No one else in the house was hurt.</p>
