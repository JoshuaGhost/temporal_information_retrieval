        <p>Magic 101, Warriors 95</p>
        <p>Anfernee Hardaway scored 29 points and Dennis Scott added 27 as the Orlando  Magic remained unbeaten at home last night with a 101-95 victory over Golden State.</p>
        <p>Nick Anderson had 20 points and the Magic, which played without Horace Grant, got its first meaningful contribution from the rookie forward David Vaughn to improve its record at Orlando Arena to 7-0.</p>
        <p>Chris Mullin led the Warriors with 23 points and Jon Barry scored 14 of his 19 points in the fourth quarter to keep Golden State in the game. Rony Seikaly had 19 points and 11 rebounds, but Tim Hardaway was held to 6 on 3-for-15 shooting.</p>
        <p>Joe Wolf made two key baskets in the last three minutes and Vaughn, the Magic's first-round draft pick, delivered season highs of 8 points and 5 rebounds in 14 minutes.</p>
        <p>Grant missed the game with a bruised left knee. Golden State was weakened when Latrell Sprewell, who scored 2 points, left the game late in the first quarter because of swelling in his left elbow.</p>
        <p>Rockets 98, Celtics 93</p>
        <p>Hakeem Olajuwon scored 24 points, and Houston capitalized on poor foul shooting by host Boston as the Rockets won their fifth straight.</p>
        <p>Boston made just 2 of 11 free throws in the fourth quarter and 9 of 22 for the game as its winning streak ended at two games. Houston was 28 for 33 for the game and 7 for 11 in the final period.</p>
        <p>The Rockets took the lead for good, 75-74, on Clyde Drexler's driving layup with 22 seconds left in the third quarter and led by as many as 7 points in the  fourth.</p>
        <p>Drexler scored 18 points, and Robert Horry had 16 points and 15 rebounds for  the Rockets. Boston was led by Greg Minor with 21 points and Dino Radja with 13  points.</p>
        <p>Dana Barros had two 3-pointers to extend his streak to 66 games with a 3-pointer, 13 games short of Michael Adams's National Basketball Association record.</p>
        <p>Trail Blazers 113, Clippers 94</p>
        <p>Rod Strickland scored 27 points and Cliff Robinson added 25 as host Portland beat Los Angeles. Strickland and Robinson broke open a close game by scoring 11  points each during the third quarter, when the Blazers took advantage of a five-minute scoring drought by the Clippers to go ahead by 20 points. Strickland made 11 of 15 shots and added 7 rebounds and 6 assists.</p>
