        <p>A DEVELOPER is refurbishing six former factories on the west side of Los Angeles in hopes of leasing the buildings to film studios or other entertainment companies.</p>
        <p>The project, known as Olympic Studios, illustrates the continuing migration of entertainment companies from Hollywood into West Los Angeles. That migration  has made a group of warehouses and former factories among the most sought-after  types of commercial real estate in the area.</p>
        <p>The 250,000-square-foot Olympic Studios is believed to be the largest single project to date involving the refurbishment of aging industrial buildings for entertainment tenants. Individual buildings range in size from 15,000 to 160,000 square feet on an 11-acre site. Dating from the early 1940's, the buildings originally housed manufacturers of aircraft parts.</p>
        <p>The project seeks to emulate the look and atmosphere of a studio back lot, including a studio gate for the Olympic Studios, said the leasing agent, David R. Wilson, a partner in the West Los Angeles office of Lee &amp; Associates. The developer, the Argonaut Group of San Francisco, plans to spend $5 million to $6  million on renovation.</p>
        <p>Olympic Studios has not yet leased any space, although leasing agents say they will soon close several deals for most of the space.</p>
        <p>The scruffy older buildings have a certain cachet in the entertainment industry, which often shuns conventional office space in favor of buildings with high interior spaces, skylights, bare brick walls and concrete floors.</p>
        <p>"Creative firms like unique buildings, and the more character the buildings have, the better," said Neal Resnick, a vice president in the West Los Angeles office of CB Commercial, a real estate firm.</p>
        <p>The conversion of low-rent factories into comparatively high-rent "creative space" is a phenomenon of the last five years, Mr. Wilson, the leasing agent, said.</p>
        <p>The popularity of rough-edged industrial buildings has made former warehouses and factories into some of the hottest real estate in the otherwise slack market of West Los Angeles. In smaller buildings that are 5,000 to 15,000 square feet in size, "tenants are almost crawling over each other to get in," Mr. Wilson said.</p>
        <p>In nearby Culver City, it is difficult to find a vacant building of more than 15,000 square feet, said Ron Rader, a broker for the Klabin Company of Los Angeles. "Almost every building is occupied by a movie company, either for set building or for production," he said.</p>
        <p>Among the most recent tenants to move into older buildings are IRS Records and IRS Media, which together leased 26,000 square feet in a renovated warehouse in Culver City; Pacific Ocean Post, a film post-production company, which leased 17,000 square feet in Santa Monica, and MCA Music Publishing, which took 21,000  square feet at 2440 Sepulveda, a former milk-processing plant in West Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>"Santa Monica could be the next Hollywood soon, to judge by the amount of production companies that are headquartered here," said Mitchell E. Stokes, vice president of the John Alle Company, a brokerage firm.</p>
        <p>The industrial buildings, which typically leased for 80 cents to $1 a square  foot a year, now lease for as much as $1.50 a square foot a year.</p>
        <p>The popularity of older buildings on the west side of Los Angeles is part of  the larger movement of entertainment companies from Hollywood to the coastal area in and around Los Angeles. Several major film studios have come to the west side, including Sony Pictures Entertainment in Culver City and MGM in Santa Monica.</p>
        <p>Owners of film production companies, in addition, often live in coastal communities like the Pacific Palisades, Malibu and Santa Monica, and prefer to work near home. The Hollywood area is perceived by some film executives as a declining area with rising crime rates.</p>
        <p>The cost of renting space for film production is a further inducement, as the price of renting old industrial buildings is half that of leasing sound stages in established Hollywood studios, in some cases. Costs aside, however, sound stages and production space in the major studios are fully booked, and as a result, many production companies have no option but to look elsewhere, according to Mr. Rader, the real estate broker,</p>
        <p>The trend is probably short-lived, because of the limited number of older buildings in the West Los Angeles area that can be made over for entertainment tenants, Mr. Wilson, the leasing agent, said. At that point, he said, tenants in search of "creative space," will be forced to look farther away, to Marina del Rey, a coastal community south of Santa Monica.</p>
