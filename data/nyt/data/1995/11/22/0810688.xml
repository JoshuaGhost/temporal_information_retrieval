        <p>New York City's subway trains and stations have grown markedly dirtier in recent months -- just as the Transit Authority eliminated hundreds of cleaning positions in a round of budget-cutting, according to a report released yesterday.</p>
        <p>During July, August and September, litter, graffiti and general grime were all worse than in the three previous months, according to a report card issued by the Transit Authority. It is based on the observations of a group of transit  workers.</p>
        <p>In June and July, the authority eliminated 208 subway car cleaning jobs, about 15 percent of the total car cleaning slots. It also cut 42 jobs cleaning stations.</p>
        <p>They were among more than 1,500 jobs eliminated at the Transit Authority this year. Its parent, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, says the transit agency will have to cut 1,500 more jobs next year.</p>
        <p>On a scale of heavy, moderate or light, the surveyors found that during the summer months, 19 percent of subway cars had heavy litter, up from 9 percent during the spring, and that 16 percent had heavy dirt on the floors, up from 9 percent.</p>
        <p>Fifteen percent of stations had heavy litter, up from 5 percent; 16 percent had heavy graffiti, up from 5 percent, and 32 percent had heavy grime on the seats and floors, up from 15 percent.</p>
        <p>On buses, the report said, cleanliness changed little.</p>
        <p>The Transit Authority made some cuts in maintenance this year, and the survey found some signs of poorer maintenance. Sixteen percent of subway elevators and  escalators were not working, up from 10 percent; 7 percent of subway cars had at least one cracked window, up from 3 percent; and 16 percent of buses had dented, scratched or loose exterior panels, up from 9 percent.</p>
