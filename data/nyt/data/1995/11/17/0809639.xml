        <p>A male police lieutenant who is planning to have a sex-change operation next  year has been cited by the Police Department for insubordination, conduct unbecoming an employee and more than 40 other departmental offenses, the A.P. reported. Lieutenant Janet Aiello, a 24-year veteran who recently changed his name from John and began dressing as a woman, was notified of the departmental charges, alleging that she ignored orders to come back to work, about a month after returning from seven months of sick and vacation leave, Police Chief Carmen LaBruno said. Linda Kenney, the lieutenant's lawyer, said, "We intend to  fight the charges and open the disciplinary hearings."</p>
