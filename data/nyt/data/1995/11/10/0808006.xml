        <p>Federal officials have ordered Baltimore to sever its contract with the Nation of Islam Security Agency and award it to another company, Mayor Kurt Schmoke said today.</p>
        <p>It was not welcome news for the Mayor, who said violent crime had fallen in the last two years at the public housing units, where the securityagency has been patrolling.</p>
        <p>He said the decision, by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, was motivated by concerns about the security agency's ties to Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam. Mr. Farrakhan, who called the Million Man March on Washington in October, is widely accused of anti-Semitism.</p>
        <p>"This is tremendously disappointing to me," Mayor Schmoke said. "We do not do this voluntarily."</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Federal housing agency, Alex Sachs, said the order stemmed from a review showing that the city had arbitrarily rated Nation of Islam Security above Wells Fargo, even though the latter had offered a bid about $1 million lower. He said the decision had not been influenced by political pressure or an investigation into the use of the agency in several cities.</p>
        <p>As part of a larger inquiry, the department said in April that it was investigating the security companies owned by Nation of Islam followers to find  out if they had supplied false tax information when they competed for contracts to patrol public housing projects in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>As of April, Nation of Islam members held security contracts for public housing projects and federally subsidized apartments in six cities: Baltimore; Buffalo; Chicago; Dayton, Ohio; New York, and Washington. The guards are unarmed.</p>
        <p>Under the Federal agency's order, which Mayor Schmoke said he wouldnot challenge, Wells Fargo will get a one-year contract. The city will cancel Nation of Islam's one-year contract, worth $4.6 million, to guard 16 public high-rise complexes in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>The security agency officials did not return calls for comment.</p>
