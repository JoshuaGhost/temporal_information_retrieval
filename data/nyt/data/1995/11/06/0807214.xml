        <p>Chrissie Hynde doesn't want complete respect. Just a little respect is enough. When she performed an acoustic set with her band the Pretenders on Saturday night at Symphony Space, she went the way of many aging rock stars and  rearranged her songs to incorporate less noise and more strings. But to counter  the classical sheen that the Duke String Quartet brought to the concert, she had the ensemble scruffily groomed and dressed down in T-shirts and jeans. Furthermore, as the quartet scraped away virtuously on the right side of the stage, a skinny man who was introduced as Wif sat on a stool on the far left, occasionally rattling a tambourine, fulfilling a function anyone with a sense of rhythm could perform.</p>
        <p>It is this contrast between the primitive and the sophisticated that has marked the Pretenders' career. The band originally rose from England's punk scene 17 years ago (with Ms. Hynde transplanted from Ohio), but soon proved that it had far more depth and ambition than its peers. As Ms. Hynde became a mother  of two and one of rock's pillars of strength and survival, two of her bandmates  died of drug overdoses.</p>

        <p>Chrissie Hynde doesn't want complete respect. Just a little respect is enough. When she performed an acoustic set with her band the Pretenders on Saturday night at Symphony Space, she went the way of many aging rock stars and  rearranged her songs to incorporate less noise and more strings. But to counter  the classical sheen that the Duke String Quartet brought to the concert, she had the ensemble scruffily groomed and dressed down in T-shirts and jeans. Furthermore, as the quartet scraped away virtuously on the right side of the stage, a skinny man who was introduced as Wif sat on a stool on the far left, occasionally rattling a tambourine, fulfilling a function anyone with a sense of rhythm could perform.</p>
        <p>It is this contrast between the primitive and the sophisticated that has marked the Pretenders' career. The band originally rose from England's punk scene 17 years ago (with Ms. Hynde transplanted from Ohio), but soon proved that it had far more depth and ambition than its peers. As Ms. Hynde became a mother  of two and one of rock's pillars of strength and survival, two of her bandmates  died of drug overdoses.</p>
        <p>At Symphony Space, the Pretenders' balance of rawness and poise worked unplugged with strings (and tambourine). Ms. Hynde's songs benefited from the clarity.</p>
        <p>Most of the music the Pretenders performed also appears in the same arrangements on their new live album, "The Isle of View" (Warner Brothers). On Saturday, Ms. Hynde added a few songs written by others that were well suited to her voice and experience, including Neil Young's "Needle and the Damage Done," Merilee Rush's "Angel of the Morning" (which Ms. Hynde also performed on the sitcom "Friends" last week) and Radiohead's two-year-old hit "Creep," an anthem  of insecurity that Ms. Hynde explored as the perfect answer song to the self-confident "Brass in Pocket."</p>
        <p>Ms. Hynde also went out of her way to make sure her audience - didn't feel alienated by the Duke String Quartet, deriding her own self-importance between songs and even going so far as to explain to the rock audience the difference between a viola and a violin.</p>
