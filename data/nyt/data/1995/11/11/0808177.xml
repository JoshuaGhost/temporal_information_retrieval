        <p>When historians look back at the national fantasy of a Colin Powell run for the Presidency, will they find tragedy or farce? My vote is for farce, because now that the dream has ended, it already seems like one of those all-American fables -- a classic Preston Sturges comedy like "Hail the Conquering Hero" perhaps, or one of General Powell's own favorite Broadway musicals, "The Music Man" -- in which Anytown, U.S.A., gives its heart, soul and wallets to a magnetic, dashing interloper in uniform who comes out of nowhere and promises to make the citizenry feel better about itself.</p>
        <p>The press coverage will surely, with hindsight, make for hilarious reading. As the public, politicians and journalists alike jumped on the bandwagon, the will to believe in General Powell as a savior ballooned so rapidly that his candidacy soon became a miracle elixir -- an instant balm for every ailment in American civic life.</p>

        <p>When historians look back at the national fantasy of a Colin Powell run for the Presidency, will they find tragedy or farce? My vote is for farce, because now that the dream has ended, it already seems like one of those all-American fables -- a classic Preston Sturges comedy like "Hail the Conquering Hero" perhaps, or one of General Powell's own favorite Broadway musicals, "The Music Man" -- in which Anytown, U.S.A., gives its heart, soul and wallets to a magnetic, dashing interloper in uniform who comes out of nowhere and promises to make the citizenry feel better about itself.</p>
        <p>The press coverage will surely, with hindsight, make for hilarious reading. As the public, politicians and journalists alike jumped on the bandwagon, the will to believe in General Powell as a savior ballooned so rapidly that his candidacy soon became a miracle elixir -- an instant balm for every ailment in American civic life.</p>
        <p>On any given day, and depending on the point of view of the beholder, General Powell was going to either speed or derail the Republican revolution. He was going to articulate the perfect compromise positions to quiet acrimonious national debates over abortion and affirmative action. He was going to mend the  rift in the G.O.P. -- or vanquish its extremist wing. He was going to restore civility to political life, reform the campaign process, increase voter registration and entertain a press corps bored by Clinton and Dole.</p>
        <p>And then there was the racial divide. Once General Powell's book tour intersected with the Simpson verdict and the Million Man March, he became the man to straighten everything out. As The Wall Street Journal put it -- on page one only the day before General Powell's withdrawal -- his mere "moral authority," combined with the color of his skin, might "ease the nation's racial tensions" and serve as an uplifting role model to alienated blacks in the metastasizing inner cities. Problem solved!</p>
        <p>No wonder everyone was depressed when General Powell took himself out of the  race he never entered. For that one brief, shining moment that was known as Powellmania, all the country's worries, with the possible exception of CBS's prime-time schedule, were over.</p>
        <p>Now that Powellmania is kaput, however, it's important that we not extend the farce by misreading its moral.</p>
        <p>The moral is not that the general misled us. Unlike Harold Hill in "The Music Man" -- a slick-talking con man who pretends to be a great band instructor to sell a town musical instruments -- General Powell was always honest. He never pretended to be running for President, and, contrary to the constant chorus that labeled him an ideological question mark, his political positions were quite unambiguous, however lacking in fine print. He was just what he said he was -- a moderate Republican -- and as such no harder to parse than Arlen Specter or William Weld.</p>
        <p>But after a point it didn't matter how General Powell characterized his views, or how reluctant a candidate he seemed, because we were so eager to embrace him as the antidote to all our woes that we stopped listening. Even his  own understandable bridling at the ludicrous expectation that he might be an American racial panacea, a "Great Black Hope," went unheeded. Far from being gulled by a con man, we conned ourselves.</p>
        <p>That we did so is the real moral of Powellmania. If, as they say in "The Music Man," there is trouble in River City -- and few doubt the gravity of America's troubles right now -- we still entertain that escapist hope for a quick, cost-free fix, whether in the form of a glib political formula like the Contract With America or a hero who will ride to the rescue.</p>
        <p>But General Powell, no matter how fine a man he is, would never have been able to deliver what we wanted: an absolution from responsibility for all the intractable problems we threw in his lap. No mortal leader could -- which is why it also now seems beside the point to demonize the political system for failing  to produce a messiah, whether named Powell or Bradley or Kemp, who will magically heal the nation.</p>
        <p>There is no such mortal. The fable of General Powell's non-candidacy will have a happy ending only if it forces us to recognize that the restoration of harmony in America is a tough, long-term job that will not get done unless we make the music ourselves.</p>
