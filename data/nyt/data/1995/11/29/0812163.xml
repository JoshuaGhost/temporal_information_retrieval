        <p>Fearing the loss of job security for his members, the head of the largest union local for city hospital workers yesterday intensified his campaign to block ratification of New York City's five-year agreement covering 140,000 municipal workers.</p>
        <p>After holding a demonstration in front of City Hall to protest the agreement, the official, James Butler, president of an 11,000-member local of municipal hospital workers, sought at a board meeting of the city's main municipal employees' union to postpone a ratification vote. Such a delay might give him time to win better terms for his local.</p>
        <p>But not only did the union's board refuse to postpone a ratification vote, the delegates of the city's main municipal union -- District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees -- also voted last  night to recommend the proposed contract to union members.</p>
        <p>Stanley Hill, executive director of that union and head of the umbrella group of municipal employees bargaining with City Hall, reached an agreement that would provide a 13 percent increase in wages and benefits over five years, but no wage increase during the first two years of the contract. The agreement also  promises no layoffs for the first three years for most municipal employees -- but not for workers in city-owned hospitals.</p>
        <p>"This is an absolute disgrace," Mr. Butler said. "How can my members agree to a contract that does not protect them from layoffs?"</p>
        <p>In the negotiations, Mr. Hill acceded to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's demand that municipal hospital workers not be given job security because that could endanger the Mayor's plans to sell 3 of the 11 city-owned hospitals to private owners.</p>
        <p>Only about a fifth of the delegates voted not to recommend the contract to the rank and file, officials at the meeting said. Opponents of the contract failed in their efforts to force a roll-call vote.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill was visibly gratified by the delegates' vote. "It was a tough meeting," he said in an interview. "The majority of delegates not only looked at the two zeros in the first two years, but they looked at the whole package, especially the job security."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill expressed confidence that members would ratify the contract. "What's important is the job security is fairly decent, there's a raise that's backloaded, and our benefits were retained," he said.</p>
        <p>He added that he would press City Hall to provide better job security assurances to Mr. Butler's union.</p>
        <p>The 140,000 employees covered by the agreement are scheduled to vote on the contract next month.</p>
        <p>In a related development, the 90,000 members of the United Federation of Teachers began voting on their own proposed contract yesterday, with a group of  dissidents seeking to persuade the rank and file to reject the agreement with the city.</p>
