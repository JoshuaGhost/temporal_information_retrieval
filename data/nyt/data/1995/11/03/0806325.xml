        <p>SOMEDAY, Anne Martin and Lynn Matarrese hope to find the perfect house: two bdrms, 1 bth, asbstos shngls.</p>
        <p>If the house should happen to boast an unpaved driveway, an unflowered lawn -- well, that might be asking too much. But they can dream. "Gosh," Ms. Martin said. "That would be great."</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin and Ms. Matarrese want that 1947 Levitt Cape Cod for the Levittown Historical Society's very own. The house would be a landmark, of course, and a museum. Visitors from all over the world could then see the four and a half rooms that turned Nassau County into a mecca for the budding nuclear  family in these United States. Ms. Matarrese, the society's curator, considers the mission urgent.</p>
        <p>"It's so important," she said, "that one pristine example of Levitt &amp; Sons design be preserved for future generations."</p>
        <p>BUT nailing down a mint tract house keeps getting harder. So much has changed since William J. Levitt, the master suburb builder, turned potato fields 20 miles from Manhattan into the country's first instant commuter community. The Levittown of social studies books, shown in aerial shots of row after row of little spud houses on blank, stamp-sized lots, is quaint ancient history.</p>
        <p>The Cape Cods of yesteryear have grown up and become Cape Cod colonials, Cape Cod Tudors, Cape Cod bungalows. Even Cape Cod mansions, with L-shaped wings and  second-story porches. There are bay windows where Levitt built skinny little windows, stone facades and vinyl siding where Levitt had asbestos or cedar shingles, shutters on windows that didn't have shutters and no shutters on windows that did.</p>
        <p>And the Levitt ranches! Many are hardly recognizable as ranches. They have two floors, three floors, two-car garages. At least one has Greek columns and statues in front. It's as if each of Levittown's 17,000 original houses was born a tabula rasa, and developed into its owner's version of the American dream.</p>
        <p>Ms. Martin, the historical society's president, lives in a Levitt ranch that  had been remodeled by the time she moved into it 30 years ago. Ms. Matarrese lives in what she calls an imitation Levitt -- "a knock-off."</p>
        <p>"There was an original ranch around here," said Ms. Matarrese, driving the maze of streets off the Hempstead Turnpike. "But you never know," she added, "when a house that was in pretty original shape has been sold and turned into a  two-story monstrosity."</p>
        <p>This worries the historical society, not only because it wants to find a headquarters. It has also been trying to find a near-pristine Cape Cod for the Town of Hempstead Landmarks Commission to designate a landmark. The homeowner would get a historical plaque and a small tax break; the house would be a showcase during a 50th-anniversary celebration for Levittown in 1997.</p>
        <p>But the historical society hasn't found an interested homeowner. For the house to become a landmark, the owner has to promise not to alter the exterior.  That's a major drawback when the major selling point of a Levittown house is still its adaptability. Ms. Martin said she had been trying to contact owners of original houses for three years.</p>
        <p>"We've written letters to 50 homeowners," she said. "Nothing."</p>
        <p>Still, she and Ms. Matarrese are fuming over a move the Landmarks Preservation Commission made two weeks ago. It granted historic status to a Levitt Cape Cod -- with aluminum siding!</p>
        <p>"It's so frustrating," Ms. Matarrese said. "Why couldn't the commission help  us raise money to buy a house in more original condition?" Just last week, she said, producers from the PBS series "This Old House" asked the society's advice in finding original houses; the one with aluminum siding "wasn't one of the houses on our list," she said.</p>
        <p>The historical society estimates that there are 200 Cape Cods in more original condition than the house made a landmark by the commission. "We're still trying to contact those homeowners," Ms. Matarrese said.</p>
        <p>But James York, vice chairman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said  the historical society was given ample time to come up with a house it considered an appropriate landmark. "During that whole time, we never received another application," he said.</p>
        <p>THE owners of the landmark house, Kathleen and Charles Weber, have lived here since the beginning, 1947. "When we moved in, it was House No. 70," Mrs. Weber said. "Now it's 52 Oak Tree Lane."</p>
        <p>She doesn't understand what the historical society is upset about. "The house is almost the same," she said. "But things break. My windows broke. My door was  warped from the day they put it in."</p>
        <p>And her shingles started to turn black. "It was a red house and they started  to turn black, so we replaced them with aluminum siding," she said. "I haven't replaced anything else."</p>
        <p>Ms. Matarrese said the siding was the big no-no. The society board members are learning how to apply for grants that could help it buy a house, which will  cost at least $125,000.</p>
        <p>"Look at this one," she said, inching along the Cape Cods on Division Avenue. "Original shingles, original shutters, original door."</p>
        <p>She scribbled down the address, in case the owners were selling and the house was still in fairly original shape when the society is ready to buy.</p>
