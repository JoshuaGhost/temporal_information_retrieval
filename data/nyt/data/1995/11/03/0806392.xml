        <p>When it comes to the living, it sometimes seems that the Metropolitan Museum  of Art thinks the only good artist is a London painter. With its 50-work survey  of Howard Hodgkin following fast on retrospectives of Lucian Freud and R. B. Kitaj, the museum's record now stands at 3 for 4. (The exception is the recent survey of Willem de Kooning's paintings.) But never mind.</p>
        <p>Compared with Mr. Freud and Mr. Kitaj, whose figurative paintings are weighted with portentousness of the painterly or the literary kind, Mr. Hodgkin, who is now 63, is altogether another species of artist. Light of touch and rich  of color, the best of his paintings frequently manage to suggest sunny gardens,  comfy interiors and paintings-within-paintings all at once -- and yet remain predominantly abstract. His exhibition, organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, has an air of freshness and visual ebullience that hasn't been seen  in this part of the Metropolitan for several innings.</p>

        <p>When it comes to the living, it sometimes seems that the Metropolitan Museum  of Art thinks the only good artist is a London painter. With its 50-work survey  of Howard Hodgkin following fast on retrospectives of Lucian Freud and R. B. Kitaj, the museum's record now stands at 3 for 4. (The exception is the recent survey of Willem de Kooning's paintings.) But never mind.</p>
        <p>Compared with Mr. Freud and Mr. Kitaj, whose figurative paintings are weighted with portentousness of the painterly or the literary kind, Mr. Hodgkin, who is now 63, is altogether another species of artist. Light of touch and rich  of color, the best of his paintings frequently manage to suggest sunny gardens,  comfy interiors and paintings-within-paintings all at once -- and yet remain predominantly abstract. His exhibition, organized by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, has an air of freshness and visual ebullience that hasn't been seen  in this part of the Metropolitan for several innings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodgkin is in many ways a master of a corrupted formalism that is especially pertinent right now. His highly personal, even autobiographical abstraction offers a pleasing contrast, in a minor key, to the exultant Mondrian retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art. And it corroborates the activities of myriad contemporary artists, starting with Jessica Stockholder, whose exhibition at the Dia Center for the Arts is a high point of the downtown season, and painters like Fiona Rae, Carroll Dunham, Jonathan Lasker and Amy Sillman.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate that the show covers only the last 20 years of Mr. Hodgkin's career, failing to give a fuller accounting of how he became himself,  although his development is tantalizingly outlined in the exhibition catalogue,  which includes a catalogue raisonne by Marla Price, director of the Fort Worth museum. Sadly, the show omits even the assured, if less developed, paintings that made Mr. Hodgkin's first New York exhibition, at the Kornblee Gallery in 1973, such a pleasant surprise.</p>
        <p>The earliest paintings here, like "Grantchester Road" and "Cafeteria in the Grand Palais," both from 1975, have a posterish stiffness that recalls British Pop Art; they give some notion of his growth as an artist, but they lack the expansiveness of the best paintings at Kornblee. And the show ends relatively weakly, showing the artist attempting larger, frequently sloppier paintings that usually betray his intimist's sensibility.</p>
        <p>Still, anyone who loves painting -- and loves to think about how paintings work on the level of both mechanics and suggestiveness, and where they spring from in the artist's life and in other art -- will want to see this exhibition.</p>
        <p>Since the late 1960's, Mr. Hodgkin has painted on small, framed wood panels,  playing the flatness and hardness of this surface against his soft fluttering brushwork and then pushing back pictorial space with emphatic painted frames that reinforce the real ones. In the resulting play between painting as object,  abstraction and picture, these frames function in different ways. Around the bright, playful shapes of "The Hopes at Home," the frame simply adds a band of darker, possibly unexamined emotion, for example. Most important, the frames compress and intensify what they contain, enabling many of these often small works to hold their own from afar.</p>
        <p>The eye is grabbed by "Dinner in Palazzo Albrizzi," for example, at a distance of three galleries. Framed in radiating strokes of black under red, its central actor is a glowing pink comma shape flanked by swaths of a dark acid green that, like the red, is one of Mr. Hodgkin's signature colors. The comma rises from a podium of blue and white dots like a latter-day Venus and could represent either a diner or dinner itself. (If shrimp is on the menu.) On an adjacent wall, the even smaller "House Near Venice," whose wide painted frame bears down on contrasting stacks of colored bands, achieves a similar far-off impact, becoming so deep from a distance that the words "tunnel vision" take on  new meaning.</p>
        <p>The great thing about Mr. Hodgkin's personalized formalism is that it keeps so much in play and on the surface, making the act of painting seem transparent, accessible and even easy. It isn't, of course. The sensuous colors, dappled patterns and emotional undercurrents of these paintings reflect a global sophistication and an astute ability to distill different experiences into images that are at once exotic and familiar. They draw from the Nabis, especially Vuillard, and from the Fauves. (The banded colors of several paintings, including "In a French Restaurant" and "On the Riviera," even include suggestions of French flags in the manner of Marquet and Dufy circa 1906.) Their allusions to lush foliage, swelling hills and decorative fabrics evoke the more  tautly composed Indian miniatures that Mr. Hodgkin has collected for nearly 30 years.</p>
        <p>The starchiness of the wood panels and the directness of Mr. Hodgkin's touch, and the radiant openness of his art, can bring to mind American folk art. The manner in which his distinctive brush marks, as he calls them, hang insouciantly in the air yet also knit together, suggests some attention to Willem DeKooning's work. There are also affinities with other English painters. One thinks of the somewhat cartoonish figural abbreviations of David Hockney's early work in front of paintings like "First Portrait of McInerney," with its intimations of a comfortably seated man in a brown jacket and red shirt and tie. And Francis Bacon's conception of the figure as a writhing blur also seems to have played a  role, minus the emotional torment, as reflected in the vague sensation of coiled bodies at the center of "In Bed in Venice."</p>
        <p>But it is not only other art that is distilled into Mr. Hodgkin's work. A good deal of life clearly goes into them, too: his travels, his love affairs, his connections to people and places, his experiences of natural beauty. Sometimes these references are rather too cloyingly prominent, as when sappy or  precious titles are attached to perfectly innocuous abstractions, like "A Small  Thing but My Own," or when a title attempts to make emotional sense out of visual chaos, as with the slashing off-kilter strokes of "It Can't Be True." And the titles do sometimes seem rather interchangeable. But even so, most of them provide useful keys to the artist's affections, which the paintings, with their  ineffable longings and unquenchable love of beauty, unlock without ever fully explaining.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hodgkin is an ecumenical artist who has honed a disparate faith into an indelible style reconciling the decorative and the narrative, the expressionistic and serene and, obviously, the abstract and the representational. Most of all he has faith in the eye's ability to fill in the blanks, to recognize the currents of life in substantially altered, independent  form, filtered through the extraordinary discipline of looking, feeling and looking again that is painting.</p>
        <p>"Howard Hodgkin: Paintings 1975-1995" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82d Street, through Jan. 28. It travels to the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth (March 31 through July 14) and the Kunstverein of the Rhineland and Westphalia, in Dusseldorf, Germany (Aug. 17 through Oct. 13).</p>
