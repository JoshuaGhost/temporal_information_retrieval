        <p>One runner was hoping to qualify for the 1996 Summer Olympics. Another had been training for a year to run his first marathon. Then, 12 hours before five Israeli athletes were to board a plane for this coming Sunday's New York City Marathon, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated.</p>
        <p>All five Israelis said they considered dropping out of the race. On second thought, they decided, what better way to carry the message of peace than running through the five boroughs of New York?</p>
        <p>Rabin's philosophy was to continue with life, no matter what," one of the marathoners, Roberto Fischer, told reporters yesterday.</p>
        <p>This past Sunday morning the five runners boarded an El Al flight from Tel Aviv and made the somber trip to New York. No movie was shown; no music was played. The runners landed, stowed their luggage with Jewish families in West Orange and Caldwell, N.J., and went directly to a memorial service.</p>
        <p>Even now, Meir Chasnik said, he cannot get the shock of Rabin's death out of  his mind. It stays with him like a shadow when he is running.</p>
        <p>"We feel remote from what's happening there," he said. "Detached."</p>
        <p>It was difficult to leave Israel in mourning, Chasnik said, but necessary.</p>
        <p>"Running is the best expression of self-peace and global peace," said Chasnik, a 37-year-old English teacher who will run his 15th marathon on Sunday, his third in New York. "It's freedom to do what you enjoy. When I run, I feel like a bird."</p>
        <p>Look at what happened in Yugoslavia, he said. As the country splintered, the  running stopped. The New York City Marathon would be an antidote to war, he said, with 28,000 runners from around the world coming together, alike in their  shorts and running shoes and their common desire to finish the 26.2-mile race.</p>
        <p>"The New York City Marathon represents the substance of peace," Chasnik said. "There is no difference in race and color. No one is thinking: 'This guy is a Jew; this guy is an Arab. I won't run against him.' The competition is the picture of peace."</p>
        <p>As reporters asked, the five Israelis yesterday realized they were from several different political parties. They didn't talk politics, they said, only  running.</p>
        <p>The trip had been organized by Jack Cohen, who publishes a magazine in Israel called Running World. Cohen spoke to the five runners -- Menachem Brailowski, 43, who has been waiting a year for this his first marathon, Chasnik, the brothers Bernardo and Roberto Fischer, and Daniel Desta -- and they decided they would make a decision as a group. Cohen persuaded them to run.</p>
        <p>The five Israelis, who range in age from 26 to 45, hope to finish Sunday's race in under four hours. The youngest, Desta, a native of Ethiopia who immigrated to Israel in 1984, is attempting to make the Israeli Olympic team for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. The other four call themselves joggers.</p>
        <p>Desta needs a time of 2 hours 15 minutes to make Israel's Olympic qualifying  standard. He will need to chop eight minutes off the 2 hours 23 minutes he ran three years ago in his only previous marathon.</p>
        <p>"It will be hard to run without thoughts of the assassination," he said. "But we have to show that we are strong and we can live with all these problems."</p>
