        <p>A REGULAR at Barney's in Locust Valley was overheard saying: "I always request the room with the fireplace. It's so cozy, with the fire and the mantel  covered with candles."</p>
        <p>Her companion agreed, but added: "Yet there is something special about eating in the bar room.  Those long belts of Barney's, mounted on the wall, make me feel as thin as Olive Oyl, even on one of my fat days."</p>

        <p>A REGULAR at Barney's in Locust Valley was overheard saying: "I always request the room with the fireplace. It's so cozy, with the fire and the mantel  covered with candles."</p>
        <p>Her companion agreed, but added: "Yet there is something special about eating in the bar room.  Those long belts of Barney's, mounted on the wall, make me feel as thin as Olive Oyl, even on one of my fat days."</p>
        <p>Indeed the legendary Barney, the hefty turn-of-the-century fire chief who once lived in this house and whose portrait and memorabilia dot the walls, would make even Bluto appear as slim as a reed.  His weight, depending on who is telling the story, ranged from 448 to more than 700 pounds.</p>
        <p>Barney's has been a restaurant for more than 10 years under a succession of owners. Late last summer two experienced restaurateurs, Mitchell and Deborah Hauser, took over. The dining room received a face lift, making it fresher and lighter. Ms. Hauser works the front of the house, while Mr. Hauser cooks the new dishes that have been added to Barney's favorites.</p>
        <p>One favorite, all-crab-and-little-filler crab cakes, escorted by a clump of salad and a snappy lemon-caper mayonnaise, is the appetizer front-runner. It is  closely followed by two newcomers. A strudel of goat cheese, shiitake mushroom and shrimp that resembles a large beggar's purse and is paired with sliced beets and a mild curry vinaigrette, is a winner. So, too, are the twin Portobello mushrooms set over arugula and chopped tomatoes with a tasty airy Parmesan crisp on top.</p>
        <p>Barney's was once known as the spot for super oysters, which could be ordered grilled, fried or on the half shell. The current menu offers tempura oysters in  a sauce of black olives and roasted tomatoes. The dish strikes out. The tempura  coating is thick and heavy, and the pungent sauce overwhelming.</p>
        <p>Missing the mark, too, was the ragout of escargots, eggplant and garlic with  a puff-pastry base and topper. It was brought down by chewy snails. Two safe, though unexciting, openers are the field-green salad and the Caesar. The Caesar  had little cheese, not a hint of anchovy and was, for the most part, a hit with  diners who do not usually like Caesar salad.</p>
        <p>Although Barney's look is sophisticated rustic, its food is undiluted sophistication. The beautifully cooked roast salmon in a gingered carrot sauce set over a cranberry-pignoli couscous is a case in point. Another high-flying fish was an evening special of mahi-mahi in a wild-mushroom crust served on escarole and a crisp potato pancake. An additional seafood star was the sextet of jumbo shrimp drizzled with avocado and red-pepper coulis.</p>
        <p>Meat lovers gave high marks to the juicy tenderloin of beef au poivre and the grilled veal chop in a broth that teemed with a variety of wild mushrooms. But a sirloin steak special was tough, and the rack of lamb was awash in a flood of rosemary demiglace. Slices of seared muscovy duck breast, cooked precisely to order, surrounded napa cabbage and a mound of sweet-potato puree. The otherwise  pleasing dish was diminished by a too-sweet plum sauce.</p>
        <p>Every evening there is a pasta special. The ravioli filled with goat cheese and yellow sun-dried tomatoes that we sampled were overly thick and chewy.</p>
        <p>But all the desserts were compelling. The creme brulee is classic, the pumpkin cheesecake creamy and delicious, the warm apple-blackberry crisp homey,  the lemon Napoleon tangy, and the chocolate-mousse roulade rich and satisfying.</p>
        <p>There are nearly 70 wine selections, most of them from California, at widely  ranging prices of $16 to $150. Among the more interesting, infrequently seen West Coast possibilities are a 1994 Markham sauvignon blanc ($20) and a 1991 Robert Stemmler pinot noir ($32). The less-than-exciting white is medium bodied, with good acidity, and the light red offers fruity notes and soft texture.</p>
