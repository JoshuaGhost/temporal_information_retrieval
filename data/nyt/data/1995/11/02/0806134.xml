        <p>Long before he was selling his schemes to the Knicks, long before he failed to sell them to Chris Webber, Don Nelson was a rambunctious college kid with a midnight brainstorm on how to get from his alma mater, the University of Iowa, to Chicago by sunrise.</p>
        <p>He began persuading a group of friends to hop moving boxcars until they ended up in Chicago, where they could catch a game at Wrigley Field or Comiskey Park and then find their way back via the train tracks. They would have to hop trains moving at high speeds, hold on to the ladders until it slowed enough where they  could hop into the vacant boxcars.</p>

        <p>Long before he was selling his schemes to the Knicks, long before he failed to sell them to Chris Webber, Don Nelson was a rambunctious college kid with a midnight brainstorm on how to get from his alma mater, the University of Iowa, to Chicago by sunrise.</p>
        <p>He began persuading a group of friends to hop moving boxcars until they ended up in Chicago, where they could catch a game at Wrigley Field or Comiskey Park and then find their way back via the train tracks. They would have to hop trains moving at high speeds, hold on to the ladders until it slowed enough where they  could hop into the vacant boxcars.</p>
        <p>It was college, but it was also dangerous and insane. Of course, Nelson's friends went along.</p>
        <p>"Always selling something, isn't he?" said Don Chaney, his former teammate and the Knicks' new assistant coach. "Nellie is always cooking up a deal or two. It's no different with this team. He's selling and he's hoping they're buying."</p>
        <p>The schemes have changed, but Don Nelson's premise has remained the same: Follow me, we're going places.</p>
        <p>"It's just my style," said Nelson. "It works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. I don't really know how to address it or describe it. But I know if people give me a chance, I usually reward them."</p>
        <p>As the Knicks head into the regular season with their opener tomorrow against the Detroit Pistons, Nelson is being counted on to achieve what not even Pat Riley could the past four years, win a championship. Can the man who has always  known how to further his own cause do the same for the Knicks?</p>
        <p>Before shoe company executives made life easier for the modern-day player, Nelson sold his own barnstorming tour in the off season with the Celtics, traveling to outposts in Maine and the Midwest with groups of players who would  fill high school gymnasiums. He sold defense and patience to the Milwaukee Bucks. He sold the game to Burma and Hong Kong and Eastern Europe through coaching clinics. He sold nearly everybody at Golden State on transition.</p>
        <p>He is a basketball entrepreneur who will not die, only resurface; a former player who 20 years ago never thought he would even coach one year, much less 18.</p>
        <p>Nelson was sitting in a hotel lobby in the mid-1970's, his playing career about to end, when his best friend from college asked him if he would consider coaching as a second career. Suddenly, a precocious player for the Boston Celtics walked through the lobby, a player for whom Nelson had little regard.</p>
        <p>Jim Tucker, the best man at both of Nelson's weddings and a professor of journalism at Fresno State University, remembered Nelson's response.</p>
        <p>"He said to me, 'Are you kidding? Can you imagine trying to coach that guy?'  He saw the new athlete emerging even then. You couldn't tell that person anything. Don was such a traditional guy himself, blue-collar, everything, he didn't understand. As it turns out, we hadn't even begun to see the beginning of it."</p>
        <p>Not everyone has bought into the dynamics of Nelson's personality, though. And it's not only players.</p>
        <p>"He didn't trust me," said Tommy Heinsohn, his former coach in Boston. "When  he was at the end of his career, I tried to be good with him. He thought I was trying to get rid of him. He wasn't ready to leave the game.</p>
        <p>"Look, Don Nelson is a hard worker. But he's very, very self-absorbed. He's an enterprising guy, but everything you see, well there is more to it than that. He's not above doing almost anything to further his cause."</p>
        <p>Nelson has earned a reputation as a coach who takes young players to task --  "He treated me like a dog," said Sarunas Marciulionis of his first years in the  league under Nelson, "but I learned from the man."</p>
        <p>Yet he has also been quick to give veterans the respect they deserve.</p>
        <p>In his first meeting with Patrick Ewing, he told the Knicks' All-Star center  that he wanted to build a relationship on trust, and that if anything ever did not sit well with Ewing for him to approach Nelson first. Nelson was mindful of  Ewing's routine under Riley and wants desperately for the transition to go smoothly.</p>
        <p>He has walked a fine line between leaving his own imprint while being careful not to completely erase Riley's.</p>
        <p>Intense as the workouts are, the jokes and the smiles flow freely during Nelson's workouts. Anthony Mason was imitating Nelson after one shootaround during the preseason, walking ever so slowly across the court and wearing Nelson's trademark dazed look across his face. Knick players erupted in laughter, but something was missing.</p>
        <p>Ewing told Mason to put a ball under his tanktop in order to pay homage to Nelson's protruding stomach. Everyone busted up.</p>
        <p>"I'm not going to say nothing bad about Pat because he got us where we are, but Nellie, he's cool," said Charles Oakley.</p>
        <p>For his part, Nelson has strayed far and clear from beating the Knicks over the head with "goal-setting" and "championship thoughts." He does not question the psychological character of his team, believing instead that because they have been to the mountain once they already know what the road looks like.</p>
        <p>"I don't think it's needed," Nelson said. "I think they feel they are contenders. And I feel they're contenders. I really haven't talked about it much. One of the players said that he thought what happened last year was that they had assumed they would just be back in the finals. And they forgot to play  all the games. So, to me, when it comes to talking championships, I don't know if it's time to answer those questions yet. I don't know why you should have to  answer them. I mean, who knows?"</p>
        <p>In the meantime, he continues to peddle his product.</p>
        <p>"You're coming across a team that has won in the past with a different coach," said Chaney. "Now you have a different guy coming in with a different concept. And you can't just show that, you've got to actually sell it to these guys because they won doing it a certain way. In order for them to adapt to a new concept, you have to do a serious selling job.</p>
        <p>"I think they're buying into it as they go along."</p>
        <p>There is no palm reader to inform Nelson whether this was his one shot at securing a title as a coach after 18 years or merely the wrong job at the wrong  time. The notion that it feels right now is all that matters, really all that has ever mattered.</p>
        <p>"It took us all night to get there, switching cars and stuff," he said of his college railway adventure. "We got there early in the morning, went to see a couple baseball games and headed back for the tracks. But we discovered trains don't go to Iowa City. They go someplace else first. We didn't know what trains  were going west and north. We end up hitchhiking home.</p>
        <p>"To me, there are situations in life. Some are unpleasant. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't go through them."</p>
