        <p>PITY the poor grown-ups in the new Fox series ''The O.C.'' Sure, they live in a ritzy beach community and have loads of money, fancy cars, massive homes and the latest clothes. And, yes, they're invited to the most fashionable parties, where they can sip the nicest Champagnes while looking gorgeous. But does that mean they're happy? Apparently not, judging by the hints of infidelity, corruption and parenting problems shaping the premiere episode of the series.</p>
        <p>It's never nice to see anyone suffer, of course, but it is somewhat heartening to see a show about adolescent angst that manages to spend some time exploring and tormenting its grown-up characters.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, ''The O.C.'' sounds like yet another teenage drama in the ''Dawson's Creek'' or ''Beverly Hills 90210'' mode. The story centers on Ryan Atwood (Benjamin McKenzie), a troubled high school boy whose parents have abandoned him. Ryan is taken in by Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), a pro bono public defender who lives with his family in the ultra-rich Orange County, Calif., suburbs.</p>
        <p>The premise seems destined to play out in a familiar way. Every week, poor but tough Ryan will probably cope with the taunts of snobby teenagers and with adults portrayed as either rigid rule makers who ''just don't understand'' or as kind yet boring souls who have no lives of their own. The people behind ''The O.C.,'' however, say the show will not only dig deeper into the lives of its troubled teenagers but will also give the privileged parents time for their own issues.</p>
        <p>''The parents were essentially there to service the plot in '90210,''' said Josh Schwartz, creator and an executive producer of ''The O.C.'' ''Their stories seemed to be generated only because of what kids' stories demanded of them. In our show, though, we want parents' stories to drive themselves. We wanted this to be more like the film 'The Ice Storm,' which had central teen characters whose stories couldn't be told without the adults' stories. We promised Peter that every episode wouldn't be him saying, 'I'm going off to work now, kids!' and returning at the end to say, 'I'm home now. How was school?'''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallagher added: ''When I met with the producers before deciding to do the show, they gave me their assurance that I wouldn't just be surfing and driving expensive cars. I could see the kids' stories would be heavy and important, but I never got the sense that the adults would be discounted and solely devices of the kids' world.''</p>
        <p>Certainly the emphasis of the show will be on its younger characters, who may drive better cars than most teenagers but still cope with the usual troubles, from peer pressure to romantic rejection. However, the producers and cast say that the episodes make the lives of the adults seem as complex as those of their children.</p>
        <p>''We all get more complicated as the show goes along,'' said Kelly Rowan, who plays Kirsten, the wife of Mr. Gallagher's character. ''There are a lot more issues that will come up. For instance, I have a very successful father and we'll explore my troubled relationship with him. The issue of mixed marriages comes up because we start to talk about the fact that Sandy is Jewish and I'm not. The subject of class differences will come up because both Sandy and Ryan come from a poor background.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenzie's Ryan, the outsider, acts as a catalyst for communication and controversy among his guardians as well as his peers. ''The parents aren't there to scold or say: 'No, Timmy! You should be doing this!' And then they all learn a lesson at the end,'' Mr. McKenzie said. ''The best example is a scene in which Kirsten and her neighbor -- Tate Donovan -- are talking about what time their kids are going to be home. The neighbor says, 'At least they're not doing anything that we didn't do,' and they kind of smile and the scene cuts to the big party we're at. This shows they care and worry about their kids but understand what they're doing because the parents have been there.''</p>
        <p>It's all part of the show's plan to create an air of authenticity that is often lacking in dramas about teenagers. ''If we play our cards right, this won't be an alienating experience to watch,'' said Mr. Gallagher. ''I think it'll be kind of reassuring to see your own experiences, whether you're a teenager or an adult, recognized in some way.''</p>
        <p>The realism is inevitable, since the show is loosely based on the life of one of its executive producers, Joseph McGinty Nichol (who goes by the professional name McG). Before becoming a music video and feature film director, he spent his teenage years in Newport Beach, Calif. Figuring that his experiences in that wealthy community might make for a good drama, he and his production company worked with Mr. Schwartz to create a story that would capture the grit behind the glitz.</p>
        <p>As the 16-year-old blue-collar bad boy, Ryan serves as the viewers' eyes and ears, but it's actually Mr. Gallagher's character who sets the story in motion.</p>
        <p>''With Peter's involvement, I assumed the parent characters wouldn't be appendages to the kids,'' Ms. Rowan said. ''And it turned out I was right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gallagher had never done a prime-time drama series before, but he felt from the moment he read the script that this show could be something more than a nighttime soap opera.</p>
        <p>''The most exciting thing as an actor is to tell a story that has a place in the world you live in, and this felt like it had that potential,'' he said. ''It wasn't just about teen angst. It was about this ever-widening gap between rich and poor.''</p>
        <p>It's not exactly news that cool kids pick on the outcasts and that being a rich adult doesn't necessarily mean being a happy adult. Teenage dramas and prime-time soaps have tread this ground for years. What does make ''The O.C.'' different, its cast and producer say, is that not only do the show's parents and children get the same amount of attention in the story lines, but they also happen to get along with one another.</p>
        <p>''At the very least, if as a parent or kid you watch this show and feel like you're not the only one dealing with these issues, that'll go a long way toward helping us find our audience,'' said Mr. Gallagher. ''If a parent isn't a total cardboard cutout, then the kids won't assume parents are all idiots. And it's important for kids to see a realistic adult life because they always think they're geniuses. This show understands that that's where the drama, the surprises and the excitement really happen.''</p>
