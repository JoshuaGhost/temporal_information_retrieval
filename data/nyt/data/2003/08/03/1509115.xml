        <p>''HE'S not coming back,'' hisses the F.B.I. agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves, possibly the only actor who could get away with playing a character whose name sounds like a pro baller's online pseudonym) at the end of ''Point Break'' (1991). Then he watches his quarry (Patrick Swayze) surf away on a monster wave that must have been rolled by Neptune himself. Utah's line may just typify how real surfers feel after seeing wave-rider movies.

        <p>Nowhere is this quality more evident than in the beautifully made documentary ''Step Into Liquid'' (opening Friday), which is such a gorgeous recording of the spume-slathered sport that cinemas screening the picture would do well to sell boards at the concession stands.</p>

        <p>''HE'S not coming back,'' hisses the F.B.I. agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves, possibly the only actor who could get away with playing a character whose name sounds like a pro baller's online pseudonym) at the end of ''Point Break'' (1991). Then he watches his quarry (Patrick Swayze) surf away on a monster wave that must have been rolled by Neptune himself. Utah's line may just typify how real surfers feel after seeing wave-rider movies. Surfing seems almost impossible to ruin on the big screen -- it's so photogenic that it's hard to believe that color film wasn't invented just to capture it.</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this quality more evident than in the beautifully made documentary ''Step Into Liquid'' (opening Friday), which is such a gorgeous recording of the spume-slathered sport that cinemas screening the picture would do well to sell boards at the concession stands.</p>
        <p>''Point Break'' (1991), directed by Kathryn Bigelow, is one of the many films that try to bring the thrill-addict speed of surfing to a fictional plot. ''Blue Crush,'' one of last summer's theatrical releases and one of this summer's cable-TV mainstays, tried to do the same. It sent a group of righteous babes to tame both the waves and the men in their lives: ''Where the Boards Are.'' But for a sense of what surfing does -- the rush of noise that seeps into your ear almost a beat after the wave has shoved you off the board -- fiction films aren't the way to go. The finest and most evocative sports movies tend to be documentaries, and that rule applies to surfing, too.</p>
        <p>Surfing documentaries shouldn't be classed with other movies about water sports, however; they're films about devotion. Though the documentary ''The Endless Summer'' wasn't released until 1966, its director, Bruce Brown, had begun shooting his tribute to wave obsession in 1962. He completed his round-the-world stalking in 1964, and two years later the picture began sneaking into theaters and drive-ins, despite a lack of interest from distributors, who thought the movie's fan base would not extend even as far as the beach bums manqués who sat nodding their heads to Dick Dale or the Beach Boys on their car radios. (Legend has it that Mr. Brown himself rented the Manhattan theater for the New York run of ''The Endless Summer,'' and its subsequent box office success still left exhibitors muttering ''fluke'' under their breaths.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown had already made a career of filming surf's-up narratives, with earlier projects like the quaint ''Slippery When Wet'' (1958) and ''Surf Crazy'' (1959), pictures that traverse the beaches of California and Hawaii in search of the ultimate tube. What Mr. Brown did with ''The Endless Summer'' was to cast off the tanning-booth stereotype that was associated with the sport after the 1960's beach movies: they had featured posing male starlets who didn't seem to know the difference between surfboard wax and floor wax. Waxen is actually the best word for the casts of movies like ''Ride the Wild Surf'' (1964), which stars Fabian and Tab Hunter. (The movie that probably started it all, the 1959 ''Gidget,'' used real-life surf heroes from Malibu as the models for some of its board-hanging crew.)</p>
        <p>''The Endless Summer'' was redolent of a dharma-bum cool that fit neatly with the awakening youth interest in Eastern philosophy and the search for a force bigger than oneself. Mr. Brown follows the dedicated boarders Robert August and Mike Hynson, whose unaffected go-with-it spirit and go-after-it attitudes are the stuff movie adventurers have to act to evoke. Mr. Brown's own fresh-air naïveté gives the film a sweetness as distinctly summery as soft-serve ice cream.</p>
        <p>THE film tracks its breaker chasers, as Mr. Brown's cameras gaze reverently at his two wholly irreverent heroes. This is one of the rare documentaries that allows for the gasps and sighs of the audience. The fluid vistas slamming into the cameras as the surfers slice through them were guarantors of inspiration, and Mr. Brown's mastery of his craft had grown -- his previous films were more affectionate than adept. His jazzy narration is also appreciably better in ''The Endless Summer.'' (Surf-documentary collectors can now own his entire series of surfing films, available in a video six-pack. His other adrenal-gland parties include the motocross film ''On Any Sunday.'')</p>
        <p>Documentaries on surfing often have a compelling, unadorned quality. But when dramatic film directors use every reality-bending trick at their disposal to make audiences believe that actors are actually threading the pipeline, the movies just look cynical.</p>
        <p>Dana Brown, the director of ''Step Into Liquid,'' came by his love of moviemaking and water naturally: he worked as a writer on ''The Endless Summer'' and on its sequel, the blissful ''Endless Summer 2.'' (The director happened to be his father.) The cinematography of ''Step Into Liquid'' captures the pearly luminosity of water -- molten, bubbling mercury that surfers dance over, a living medium transforming itself from one state to another as the sun moves across the sky.</p>
        <p>Dana Brown's movie is a much more active and stripped-down film than his father's surfing documentaries. He assumes, correctly, that the world no longer has to be educated about surfing. The Browns are a filmmaking dynasty who deserve far more attention than they've earned so far. They not only made the world ready for tube-sailing highlights in theaters -- they also left the crowd ravenous for the real thing.</p>
