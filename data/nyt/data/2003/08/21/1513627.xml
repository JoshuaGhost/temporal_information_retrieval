        <p>WHEN the United States entered World War I in 1917, its railroad system had just undergone three decades of torrid expansion after the adoption of a standard track width. While the expansion was unquestionably a boon, it also created the potential for new logistical problems.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden there was a demand to rush all of this war matériel and troops to the East Coast and there was a complete meltdown of the system,'' said Bill Withuhn, transportation curator at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. ''All of the ports on the East Coast were totally clogged up because they could not get the railroad cars unloaded. There is a famous story of one troop train that sat on a siding in Ohio for four days because the system was overloaded. The effect of this was colossal, and the parallel is immediate and is an exact duplicate in some ways to the blackout.''</p>
        <p>Like the World War I railroad meltdown, last week's blackout was vast precisely because of the interconnectedness that the network was meant to exploit and foster.</p>
        <p>The 1917 crisis, which prompted the federal government essentially to take over the railroad system, found another digital echo last week in the unleashing of the malicious Internet worm known as MSBlast. While most computer viruses and worms have required users to click on an infected file, the MSBlast program was perhaps the first to come to widespread attention that could infect computers without users' doing anything at all. In a way impossible on more primitive networks and computers, MSBlast exploited the most modern systems to create chaos.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the blackout and the worm underscore a far-reaching challenge in managing modern technological societies: the difficulty of reaping the benefits of networks -- railroad networks, airline networks, telephone networks, power networks and computer networks, among others -- while minimizing their vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>''All of these events demonstrate that network effects, which are generally good in most situations, can go the other way,'' said Bruce Schneier, chief technical officer at Counterpane Internet Security in Cupertino, Calif., and author of ''Beyond Fear: Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World'' (Copernicus Books, 2003). ''Networks are meant to connect disparate systems, but as they become larger, now you can have power outages that affect half the country, Internet outages, and broader sorts of problems.''</p>
        <p>As Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute, a unit of George Washington University, puts it: ''The plus of a network is that everything is connected. The minus of a network is that everything is connected.''</p>
        <p>The airline industry has discovered just that. Before passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, the government generally controlled route assignments and the carriers' resulting schedules. With deregulation, many airlines consolidated operations geographically and adopted hub-and-spoke route systems in which travelers often pass through a carrier's hub airport to board a connecting flight.</p>
        <p>Deregulation and the increasing prevalence of hub-and-spoke systems are often credited for their efficiency, and even for extending the airline network itself. The costs of that network expansion, however, are evident to almost anyone who flies: the risk of huge delays. ''The whole advantage of a network is that you can now go to anywhere in the world with one or two connections,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''The problem is that any time you have a glitch anywhere in the network it effects the entire system. If there is a thunderstorm in Chicago, all the flights in New York are held up.''</p>
        <p>''You now don't have any small delays,'' he added. ''You either have no delays or you have massive delays.'' Part of the reason, he said, is that until recently airlines tried to schedule their flights for profitability without due regard for the physical limitations of airports. ''The Airline Deregulation Act didn't talk about constraints,'' he said. ''It talked about freedoms.''</p>
        <p>By the summer of 2000, Mr. Jenkins said, the extent of the delays had become intolerable, and the difficulties prompted airlines to consult more often with the agencies that run airports. ''It's only in the last couple of years that the government that runs the infrastructure and the airlines are actually working together,'' he said. ''You can make a very good network as long as you stay within the constraints, but before, everyone ignored the constraints, and that's where the problems came.''</p>
        <p>Some power experts suspect that the blackout may have been caused at least in part by power network operators who similarly focused more on profits than on their networks' constraints.</p>
        <p>Power lines are generally rated to carry current only of a certain strength. When a line in a certain area fails, the local utility usually has two options: to cut off customers or route the power through other lines.</p>
        <p>The problem with rerouting it is that if all the nearby lines and systems are operating near maximum capacity, the added load from the line that failed may push them into overload as well. Such a cascading effect appears to have contributed to the blackout.</p>
        <p>''The system is designed for the most part for something called single contingency,'' said Rick Bush, editor in chief of Transmission &amp; Distribution World, a trade magazine for the power delivery industry. ''If one line goes down or one substation goes down or one event occurs, the current that was flowing through that line can move to other lines without a major outage. It's like a computer server. You can lose one server and you won't notice, and that's like the grid, but when you have two or three events that occur they can knock you out.''</p>
        <p>One way to prevent that sort of problem is to leave enough unused capacity on transmission lines -- known as headroom -- so they can absorb more current in an emergency.</p>
        <p>It appears that many electrical systems had little headroom remaining when the blackout occurred. One reason could be that it was a hot day. Another could be that network operators realize that unused headroom does not generate any profits.</p>
        <p>''I'm speculating,'' said Alex McEachern, president of Power Standards Lab, a power testing laboratory in Emeryville, Calif., ''but these relays on the transmission grid are adjustable, and it's very easy for an engineer or system operator to make it tolerate a little more power flow than was originally intended -- and if you do that, you can buy or sell more electricity.'' That, however, leaves little margin for emergencies.</p>
        <p>In one sense, the blackout, the MSBlast worm and the SoBig virus circulating on the Internet this week were similar, causing disruption by generating excess traffic in systems that cannot handle it.</p>
        <p>''There is certainly a parallel between the power network and the worm because they were affecting two different networks in the same way,'' said Ric Telford, director for architecture and technology in I.B.M.'s autonomic computing division. ''The worm created an unexpected flow of traffic.''</p>
        <p>There is an essential difference, however, between power networks and communication networks. In an overload, a power network risks extensive physical damage because of the sheer amount of electricity swirling around. Even when overloaded, a communications network does not risk physical damage. ''The electric power system has the distinctive characteristic that it contains and moves around all of the energy necessary to destroy itself,'' Mr. McEachern said. ''The implication is that you must design the system to protect itself.''</p>
        <p>That is why power generators shut themselves down completely when they detect significant anomalies in the surrounding grid. If a generator continues to try to operate in the context of surrounding fluctuations, the generator itself could be damaged.</p>
        <p>By contrast, when an Internet router is overloaded, it simply starts dropping excess data packets completely. Those packets disappear, but the router itself usually continues to function, and at least some traffic gets through. Phone systems permit similar work-arounds.</p>
        <p>''The two big differentiators are that we don't sustain physical damage and that we can be much more selective about how we manage our loads,'' said Bill Leighton, vice president for research at AT&amp;T Labs. ''The worst we get is that a switch gets overloaded and has to be reset and is out for 20 minutes. But you don't have this risk of physical damage or damage to the turbines that power networks have to worry about.''</p>
        <p>The stereotypical physical danger to a communications network is an errant backhoe. Yet even construction crews are less of a danger than they used to be because modern communication networks can often reroute traffic in an emergency.</p>
        <p>In the sense of risking physical damage because of an overload, power networks may most closely resemble early railroad networks. When standardized track widths finally allowed the creation of a true network in the 1880's and 90's, they were accompanied by a big increase in deadly accidents, according to Mark Reutter, editor of Railroad History, a scholarly historical journal.</p>
        <p>''The network and the demands of the network got skewed out of place,'' Mr. Reutter said. ''There was a new network and at the same time there was a tremendous increase in traffic, almost of dot-com proportions. They just didn't have the answers and were just groping forward, a bit like we are now.''</p>
