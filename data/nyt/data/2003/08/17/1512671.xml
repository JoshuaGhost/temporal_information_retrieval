        <p>SOME say the 1980's are back.</p>
        <p>There are style-crazed magazines that are tireless in promoting an 80's revival as fashion's next wave. The September Vogue, out this week and weighing in at 4 pounds 3 ounces, is not one of them. Instead, Anna Wintour said last week, fashion is saying so long to its bohemian detour through Morocco and points East. Fashion, she said with palpable relief, has come back to town and hit the salon for a wax and polish, ready to be a sophisticate again.</p>

        <p>SOME say the 1980's are back.</p>
        <p>There are style-crazed magazines that are tireless in promoting an 80's revival as fashion's next wave. The September Vogue, out this week and weighing in at 4 pounds 3 ounces, is not one of them. Instead, Anna Wintour said last week, fashion is saying so long to its bohemian detour through Morocco and points East. Fashion, she said with palpable relief, has come back to town and hit the salon for a wax and polish, ready to be a sophisticate again.</p>
        <p>But then, Ms. Wintour has always been about faultless grooming. As the longtime editor in chief of Vogue (15 years this month), she may have a sizable weak spot for a long, lean silhouette executed in chicest black. But her best-loved thing is not a silk taffeta Saint Laurent or a pair of Manolo Blahniks. It is her desk.</p>
        <p>It was made for her in 1986 by Alan Buchsbaum, who was at the time one of New York's most influential interior architects, a pioneer of high-style, high-tech loft spaces. That same year, Janet Malcolm, writing in The New Yorker, described one of his projects (the loft of another noted editor, Rosalind Krauss of October) as ''one of the most beautiful living spaces in New York.'' Ms. Wintour was living in a Buchsbaum-designed house in Greenwich Village and had been newly appointed editor of British Vogue. She needed a desk and appealed to her favorite designer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchsbaum, who had just designed a line of furniture for Écart International, a French company, sold her his desk prototype, a long, lean affair with playful legs reminiscent of the fins of a 1950's Cadillac. The piece, which was designed to be used as a dining table or desk, is made of sandblasted ebonized mahogany with an inset panel of black patinated steel. (The line was discontinued in 1992 when Écart was sold by its owner, Andrée Putman.) Ms. Wintour took the desk to England, then brought it back the next year when she was made editor of House &amp; Garden. Less than a year later, she took it to Vogue, where it and she have remained.</p>
        <p>''It's very clean, but it's a bit quirky,'' she said. ''It has a sense of humor.'' It is also fairly slender (''I don't want people to feel far away when they're talking to me,'' she said) and does not have any drawers (''I like everything out in the open''). And she likes that it is more table than desk.</p>
        <p>''It's not so corporate,'' she said. It is, however, very elegant, its simple lines recalling the designs of the Modernist master Jean Prouvé. And much like its owner herself, it has admirably withstood fashion's changing tastes.</p>
        <p>However, one thing above others endears the desk to her. ''It reminds me of Alan,'' she said. ''He was the first good friend I had who died of AIDS.''</p>
        <p>After his death, in April 1987, AIDS awareness became a cause for Ms. Wintour, and she helped start fund-raising events like Seventh on Sale. She admitted, though, that recently, with the advent of medications that offered hope if not an outright cure, she, like many people, has become too complacent about H.I.V. Now, she said, with new statistics about higher infection rates in the United States and drug-resistant strains of the virus, ''all of us want to raise awareness again.'' Another Seventh on Sale fund-raiser is planned for next spring.</p>
        <p>In short, this might not be the time to mention that the 1980's are back. For some, they never really went away.</p>
