        <p>The mailroom at 50 Murray Street (below), a former I.R.S. office in Manhattan converted into rental apartments, sheds new light (literally) on the task of depositing the mail. Government-issue metal mailboxes have been replaced with glass ones (lightly frosted for privacy), lighted by concealed bulbs. And the mail carrier creates performance art. ''He changes the installation every day,'' said Jay Valgora of V Studio, who designed the mailroom. (V Studio is a subsidiary of WalkerGroup, and Mr. Valgora is design principal for both). Passers-by also get in on the show -- the back of one set of boxes faces the street. Junk mail is tossed into an altar in the mailroom's center. V Studio is at 95 Morton Street, New York; (212) 462-8000.</p>
