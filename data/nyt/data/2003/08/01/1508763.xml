        <p>A stained-glass window belonging to the Zion Episcopal Church in Rome, N.Y., and dating from 1857, was stolen last weekend, along with the van it was in.</p>

        <p>The only real clue is the dirt bike left where the van used to be. Maybe that means some kid took it for a joy ride.</p>
        <p>Then again, this van is not well suited to bird-dogging girls and cruising the drag strip. It looks functional at best, extra long with four racks and a ladder on top, built for hauling.</p>
        <p>Thomas J. Ma -- Jimmy to his friends -- planned to use the van for just that purpose. Last Saturday night, he loaded a round stained-glass window nearly a century old depicting the star of Bethlehem and considered irreplaceable by the Zion Episcopal Church in Rome, N.Y.</p>
        <p>He parked it in front of his carport on 10th Street in Secaucus, N.J. By 8 a.m. Sunday, he said, the van was gone.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Ma spends his days searching desolate parts of Union, Jersey City and Newark for the van. Donald Samick, president of J. &amp; R. Lamb Studios, of Clifton, N.J., which created the stained-glass piece nearly a century ago, restored it last month and hired Mr. Ma to return it to Rome, is offering a reward. The leaders of the congregation are putting their faith in Mr. Samick's efforts to retrieve the glass. And the police are stumped.</p>
        <p>Thefts of stained-glass windows occur periodically in the New York region, with thieves sometimes selling them to antiques dealers. Last year, a grave robber took reproductions of Tiffany windows from a mausoleum in Flushing, and in 2001 a gang stole 17 windows from historic homes in Newark. But this time the big mystery is the thief's intent.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if they knew it was in there or if it was just a stolen vehicle,'' said Detective Thomas O'Keeffe of the Secaucus Police Department, adding that Mr. Ma has not been questioned and is not a suspect. ''There were no leads.''</p>
        <p>This particular window's story dates back to 1857.</p>
        <p>That was the year that Henry B. Whipple, the missionary who had overseen construction of the church building in Rome, left his post, later to become the bishop of Minnesota. It was the same year that Joseph and Richard Lamb, immigrants from England, founded their stained-glass business. In 1873, the church slowly began replacing its opaque windows with stained-glass pieces illustrating the life of Christ. In 1916 it hired Frederick Stymetz Lamb, son of Joseph Lamb and inheritor of his father's shop, to design a piece on the birth of Christ.</p>
        <p>What he came up with was a 7-foot diameter circle in total, with a 12-inch circle at the center, 12 14--by-34-inch petals and 12 7--by-14-inch triangles radiating out in muted shades of blue, amber and green. It showed a brilliant star shining down on a smeared world, like daytime in a dream.</p>
        <p>In the church, built in the traditional style in the shape of a cross facing east, this window was installed in the wall to the right of the altar, the south transept, and it was complemented by a similar window depicting the crucifixion on the north transept.</p>
        <p>''There are these two facing windows that are the beginning and the end,'' said Jerome Brown, the church's treasurer and the chairman of the stained-glass committee. ''It's important to us because of the symbolism, and practically everybody in the church has grown up with it.''</p>
        <p>After all, it has been in the wall for nearly a century, as Frederick and his brother Charles passed the stained-glass business on to Charles's son Karl, and as Mr. Samick bought the business from the family after Karl's death in 1969. The window was there until April 2003, right around the time that the Library of Congress recognized the historical value of the thousands of designs created by J. &amp; R. Lamb Studios by beginning a three-year project to acquire the company's archives.</p>
        <p>On April 8, the church hired J. &amp; R. Lamb to restore the star window. The company restored the crucifixion scene two years earlier.</p>
        <p>When the job on the Bethlehem piece was done, Mr. Samick hired Mr. Ma to return the window to Rome, near Syracuse, and install it in the church. Mr. Samick has hired Mr. Ma for about two dozen installations, some of them involving artwork as highly regarded as the star piece, in the past year. The window was loaded into the van in 25 individually wrapped pieces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ma said that his next-door neighbor saw the van sitting out in front of the carport at midnight on Saturday. He noticed it was missing at 8 a.m. Sunday, when he left his house to make the trip to Rome. ''The whole thing was totally shocking,'' Mr. Ma said.</p>
        <p>The church has insurance that covers the lost window, but primary responsibility for the artwork should fall to J. &amp; R. Lamb and its insurers, according to Mr. Brown, the church treasurer. Mr. Samick said that he is willing to pay $1,000 to have the stained glass back.</p>
        <p>''I'm assuming he didn't know this piece of stained glass was in there,'' Mr. Samick said, referring to the thief. Still, he has been calling pawnshops, antiques stores, stained glass studios and salvage lots, asking them to watch for the missing artwork.</p>
        <p>The police report says that tools belonging to Mr. Ma were in the van, too. Those are said to be worth $12,000. The report lists the value of the stained glass as $50,000, though Mr. Samick later said it was more like $60,000.</p>
        <p>''The pieces of this are irrelevant to anybody,'' Mr. Samick said. ''I'm afraid the person who stole it is going to think, 'This is something I can sell on the street.' ''</p>
        <p>Detective O'Keeffe said that finding a fence might prove difficult. ''People are going to be looking for something like that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the police report, the van itself is described as a white 2000 Chevrolet, Rhode Island license plate 132204. No one bothered to estimate its value.</p>
