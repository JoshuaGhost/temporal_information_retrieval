        <p>Three of Canada's big five banks reported higher quarterly earnings today, with improved investment banking business and lower loan-loss provisions offsetting the strong Canadian dollar on revenues from American operations. The Royal Bank of Canada improved net income 7 percent, to 776 million Canadian dollars ($554 million). The Bank of Nova Scotia's earnings rose 11 percent, to 626 million Canadian dollars ($447 million), and the Bank of Montreal reported a 46 percent increase in earnings to 504 million Canadian dollars ($360 million). The period, which ended July 31, was their fiscal third quarter. Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal raised their quarterly dividends. Bank of Nova Scotia increased its payout earlier this year.</p>
