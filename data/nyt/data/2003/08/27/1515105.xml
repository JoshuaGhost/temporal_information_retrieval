        <p>Germany's economy is still slumping, but hopes for a brighter future are taking hold. The Ifo Institute reported in its monthly survey of businesses that sentiment rose in August for the fourth consecutive month. The jump, to 90.8 from 89.3, in July was greater than analysts had expected. Business people remain gloomy about current economic conditions, with retail sales still weak. Manufacturers and wholesalers, however, are more confident.</p>
