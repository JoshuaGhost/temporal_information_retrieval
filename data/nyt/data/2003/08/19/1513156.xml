      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Air Transportation Stabilization Board, set up by Congress to give financial aid to the airline industry after the Sept. 11 attacks, said yesterday that its executive director was resigning.</p>
        <p>The director, Daniel G. Montgomery, will step down on Friday to work for Kroll Zolfo Cooper L.L.C., the financial consulting subsidiary of Kroll Inc., the board said.</p>
        <p>The Treasury Department offered Mr. Montgomery a job as an administrator for the board in February 2002, and he was named as executive director on April 30, 2002. Immediately before that, Mr. Montgomery had worked for the Bank of America in Charlotte, N.C., and in New York, where he reviewed loan requests from companies. He applied the same skills to his stint on the board.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the board, Betsy Holahan, said Mr. Montgomery was not available for comment yesterday afternoon.</p>
        <p>The board said that until a new executive director has been selected, Brian C. Roseboro, the Treasury Department's assistant secretary for financial markets, would serve as acting director.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montgomery led a staff of five workers in reviewing applications from airlines for financial aid and giving recommendations to the voting members on whether to give it.</p>
        <p>Congress established the board to do two things: Distribute $5 billion in cash to bolster the airlines immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks and review requests for up to $10 billion of loan guarantees to airlines.</p>
        <p>The first task was fairly straightforward. The second drew its share of criticism. Some people in the industry attacked the government for interfering with free-market forces and giving a lifeline airlines that would have otherwise gone out of business.</p>
        <p>In December 2001, the board approved a $380 million loan guarantee for America West Airlines. In exchange, the airline agreed to meet certain financial conditions and gave the government the option to buy up to a third of the company's stock.</p>
        <p>The board also approved a $900 million loan guarantee to US Airways.</p>
        <p>But it rejected one in December for United Airlines, which applied for a $1.8 billion guarantee. The board said the airline had to fix its business model before requesting government help.</p>
        <p>Without the loan guarantee, United had limited access to the capital markets and was forced to file for bankruptcy protection. It is still struggling to emerge from bankruptcy court.</p>
