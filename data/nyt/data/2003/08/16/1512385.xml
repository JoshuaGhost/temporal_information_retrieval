        <p>City Councilman Allan W. Jennings Jr., a Democrat who has long battled with the Queens Democratic organization, has been knocked off the ballot, officials from the New York City Board of Elections said Thursday.</p>
        <p>It was a rare instance of an incumbent city council member losing a ballot spot, preventing him from seeking re-election.</p>
        <p>John Ravitz, the chairman of the Board of Elections, said that Mr. Jennings had been removed because of a ruling the previous evening by a State Supreme Court judge in Queens that found irregularities in Mr. Jennings's nominating petitions.</p>
        <p>Justice Janice A. Taylor noted that Mr. Jennings had failed to collect the 900 valid signatures of registered Democrats in his district in the Jamaica, Rochdale Village and Richmond Hill sections of Queens. During a court hearing, Mr. Jennings testified that he could not remember several details of how his nominating petitions had been collected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings had faced Yvonne Reddick, the district manager of Community Board 12 in Jamaica, in the Sept. 9 Democratic primary. If the removal stands, Ms. Reddick would win the seat automatically, as she has no other primary or general election opponents.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Jennings said he intended to fight his removal from the ballot in court and his lawyers were preparing an appeal. He said his removal was the work of the Democratic Party in Queens, which he said disliked him because of his independence.</p>
        <p>''They don't like me because I don't take orders from them,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''I have been fighting with them for years, long before I was elected to the Council.He added: ''They are upset with me because I voted against the property tax,'' referring to the 18.5 percent increase that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the City Council adopted last fall.</p>
        <p>''This is what they do to people they don't like. And even if they challenge you and you win, you still have to spend thousands of dollars in legal fees. They try to drive you out any way they can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings also accused Justice Taylor of being biased toward the Democratic party organization.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, the Queens Democratic organization withdrew its support for Mr. Jennings, saying that his behavior had become eccentric and that he had failed to become an effective legislator. Party officials have pointed to a series of embarrassing incidents, including the purchase of ads in two newspapers in which Mr. Jennings declared his love for a new girlfriend while disparaging his former wife.</p>
        <p>In the ads, which Mr. Jennings placed in Chinese language newspapers earlier this year, he said his Taiwanese former wife and her family had not been particularly welcoming to ''someone of African descent.'' That prompted a response from Mr. Jennings's former wife accusing him of being physically abusive. He has denied those charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jennings was elected in 2001, defeating a candidate backed by Democratic leaders in Queens. He had run for office several times before that, unsuccessfully, and always against a candidate endorsed by the Democratic party leaders.</p>
        <p>Thomas Manton, the Queens Democratic Party chairman, said yesterday that Mr. Jennings had been involved in politics long enough to know how to remain on the ballot and that it was his own fault that he had not adequately collected his petition signatures.</p>
        <p>''He's a crybaby,'' Mr. Manton said. ''It's a competitive situation and just as he was able to get on the ballot and win two years ago, things have gone differently for him this time. We've all won some and lost some. There is no need for him to say anyone is out to get him. Maybe it's just immaturity.''</p>
