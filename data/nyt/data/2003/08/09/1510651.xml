        <p>Even fairy tales have their difficult passages, and Ian Smart is in the middle of another one. Jets Coach Herman Edwards says Smart must learn to hold on to the football better.

        <p>Even fairy tales have their difficult passages, and Ian Smart is in the middle of another one. Jets Coach Herman Edwards says Smart must learn to hold on to the football better. Smart shrugs and agrees, but these are the pedestrian challenges of football, not the life-altering challenges of his youth.</p>
        <p>Smart was 5 years old when his mother was shot and wounded by his father during an argument. Ten years later, his father was killed at a party. Three years after that, a burning candle ignited a blaze that leveled the family's home in North Babylon on Long Island. No one was injured, but Smart's family lost everything and, for a time, lived out of its car.</p>
        <p>Smart persevered and attended C. W. Post, a Division II college on Long Island, on a track scholarship; he was an ECAC champion at 200 meters. Smart, who did not start playing football until he was 13, set collegiate records for career touchdowns (95) and scoring (570 points). He is fourth in career rushing yards with 6,647. But he was ignored in the draft; at 5 feet 8 inches and 185 pounds, he was written off as a small player from a small college.</p>
        <p>Smart was not disappointed, and he was delighted when the Jets invited him to minicamp for a tryout. Edwards took an interest in him, intrigued by his speed and all those yards. On the first day of camp, Smart said he was one step from living his dream of playing in the N.F.L. It was like the Wayne Chrebet story, but with more pathos.</p>
        <p>Reality, though, has set in. Chrebet, a 5-10 receiver out of Hofstra, made the Jets with a nearly flawless training camp in 1995. Smart is trying to make a team that is strong at running back. His best chance may be as a kick returner. He is locked in a battle with Albert Johnson; early last season with the Dolphins, Johnson was second in the American Football Conference in kickoff returns, behind the Jets' Chad Morton, until sustaining a season-ending knee injury in the fourth week.</p>
        <p>Johnson and LaMont Jordan will have the first opportunities to return kickoffs on Sunday, when the Jets play the Cincinnati Bengals at Giants Stadium. Then Smart will have his chance.</p>
        <p>''It's definitely a grind now,'' Smart said. ''I have to do what I have to do just to make this team. Now it's mental, just to see how well you can hold up.''</p>
        <p>Last week, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Smart returned two kickoffs for 48 yards, including one for 31 yards. Johnson returned two for 52 yards, also returning one for 31 yards. As a running back, Smart had just 6 carries for 14 yards.</p>
        <p>In practice, Smart has fumbled a few times. He fumbled in the morning practice Thursday and bobbled a punt in the afternoon. Smart said he fumbled occasionally early in his Post career, but then improved.</p>
        <p>''He has to hold onto the ball and that is his whole deal,'' Edwards said. ''If he can hold onto the ball, he has a chance to help us. He can't let guys rip the ball from him. He is conscious of that and sometimes he runs like that. When they rip it out a couple of times, you start to run different. He has to gain confidence in his skills to run the football.''</p>
        <p>The warning has resonated with Smart.</p>
        <p>''That's definitely a message,'' he said. ''Fumbling is all about staying focused. I've got to remain calm.''</p>
        <p>On special teams, Smart may need to unleash more energy. Mike Westhoff, the special teams coach, said he wondered if Smart, for all his speed, had the burst that Morton or Santana Moss have. Johnson seems to be recovering his speed after missing much of the last two seasons with injuries to both knees. But Johnson does not have Smart's field vision, Westhoff said.</p>
        <p>Morton, now with the Washington Redskins, had both last season, and it showed. He was among the leaders in the N.F.L. with a 26-yard average on kickoff returns, including two for touchdowns. Curtis Martin said early in training camp that he liked Smart because he was not afraid to run up into the hole. The Jets are waiting to find out if Smart, after a lifetime of rocky roads, can travel this one quickly enough.</p>
        <p>''Can he make the right read, get into the hole and, wham, accelerate through it before it closes like the really good ones do?'' Westhoff said. ''We don't know that. That's what we are going to have to determine.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>WAYNE CHREBET has a sore shin and is questionable for Sunday's game. Receiver JONATHAN CARTER had fluid drained from his knee and is also questionable. Long snapper BOBBY BRANDT (sore back) and receiver CECIL MOORE (knee strain) are out. . . . JAMIE HENDERSON, who missed last season with a shoulder injury, will play cornerback only after the Jets stop experimenting with him at safety.</p>
