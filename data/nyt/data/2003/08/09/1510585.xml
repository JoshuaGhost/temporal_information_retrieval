      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Twenty-one months after American-backed forces drove the Taliban from Kabul, Afghanistan remains a long way from recovery and stability. The Bush administration, distracted by Iraq and dismissive of nation-building, initially failed to provide Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, with the help he desperately needed to rebuild his country's economy and institutions, undermining one of America's first and most important accomplishments in the war on terrorism. Fortunately, the White House is now considering a more generous approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karzai's power barely extends beyond Kabul, the only part of Afghanistan patrolled by international peacekeepers. Elsewhere, warlords maintain their own security forces, collect their own taxes and otherwise undermine the government's authority. The rebuilding of vital roads, including the main road between Kabul and Kandahar, has still not been completed. Thousands of students are still studying outdoors in tents.</p>
      </block>
      <block class="online_lead_paragraph">
        <p>On Sept. 11, America paid a terrible price for not doing more to stabilize Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal in the late 1980's. It cannot afford to repeat that mistake.</p>

        <p>Twenty-one months after American-backed forces drove the Taliban from Kabul, Afghanistan remains a long way from recovery and stability. The Bush administration, distracted by Iraq and dismissive of nation-building, initially failed to provide Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, with the help he desperately needed to rebuild his country's economy and institutions, undermining one of America's first and most important accomplishments in the war on terrorism. Fortunately, the White House is now considering a more generous approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karzai's power barely extends beyond Kabul, the only part of Afghanistan patrolled by international peacekeepers. Elsewhere, warlords maintain their own security forces, collect their own taxes and otherwise undermine the government's authority. The rebuilding of vital roads, including the main road between Kabul and Kandahar, has still not been completed. Thousands of students are still studying outdoors in tents.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon spends $10 billion a year on the 9,000 American troops fighting Taliban remnants, mainly in the east and south of the country. The administration has spent less than $1 billion on reconstruction so far, although Congress has authorized much more.</p>
        <p>Ambassador William Taylor Jr., the State Department's coordinator for Afghan reconstruction, has been developing plans to provide greater support for government ministries. The White House is soon expected to announce a much needed acceleration of reconstruction aid that some reports say could double current spending levels. More money from Washington should prompt additional contributions from Europe and Japan as well. Europe can also make an important contribution to security by agreeing to extend international peacekeeping forces beyond Kabul when NATO takes over command of the mission next week. That will take several thousand additional troops and a new mandate from the Security Council.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 11, America paid a terrible price for not doing more to stabilize Afghanistan after the Soviet withdrawal in the late 1980's. It cannot afford to repeat that mistake.</p>
