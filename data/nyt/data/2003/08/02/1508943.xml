        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki vetoed a bill yesterday that would have blocked New York City transit officials from closing 62 subway MetroCard booths over the next year while an advisory panel studied safety threats to the city's subways and buses.</p>
        <p>The bill, which the State Legislature passed in June, called for an immediate moratorium on closing subway fare booths ''except for the purposes of repair and renovation or in case of emergency'' while the advisory panel reviewed the city's antiterrorism and security measures over the next three years.</p>
        <p>City transit officials want to close the booths to save money.</p>
        <p>The bill specified that the governor and legislative leaders would appoint the seven-member advisory panel, which was to include people from law enforcement and emergency response management, as well as commuters. The panel would make recommendations and then report publicly on its findings.</p>
        <p>In his veto message yesterday, Mr. Pataki did not specifically address the proposed moratorium on subway booth closings, and a spokeswoman later stressed that his concern was over security.</p>
        <p>The governor wrote that there was no demonstrated need for a safety panel that would, in effect, duplicate the efforts of the New York Police Department, which is responsible for safety in the transit system.</p>
        <p>''Indeed, unlike the N.Y.P.D., which has expertise, knowledge and experience in such matters,'' he wrote, ''nothing in the bill requires members of the panel to have any experience with respect to counterterrorism, crime reduction or crime prevention.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki also expressed concern that reporting publicly on the city's security measures could undermine them.</p>
        <p>''Any portions of the report of the panel setting forth such information must be kept confidential so as to avoid providing a road map of potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by terrorists and other criminals,'' he wrote.</p>
        <p>The governor's veto appeared to clear the way for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to shut down 45 part-time subway fare booths as soon as this summer.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year, M.T.A. officials proposed the closings as part of a larger cost-cutting that would eventually close 62 fare booths this year. They have said that the majority of those booths are staffed five hours a day, or less, and are in stations with other booths.</p>
        <p>John McCarthy, a spokesman for the authority, declined to comment on the planned timetable for the booth closings but expressed support for the governor's decision. ''When it comes to subway security, the M.T.A. has full confidence in the expertise of the N.Y.P.D.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>State Senator Guy J. Velella, a Bronx Republican who sponsored the bill, said he believed that keeping the subway booths open was a way to ensure public safety. He said that he hoped to meet with the governor to pursue a compromise.</p>
        <p>''If you're up here in the Bronx, where I am,'' he said, ''and you're taking the subway late at night, you'd want to stand down there by the subway booth. It's not 100 percent secure, but it's a lot better than having no subway booths.''</p>
