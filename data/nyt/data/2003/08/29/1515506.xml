        <p>The secret workings of Tony Blair's government have been on public display this month as a judicial inquiry has gathered testimony on the death, apparently by suicide, of a British weapons scientist, David Kelly. Yesterday, it was Mr. Blair's turn to testify. His defense of almost all aspects of his government's use of intelligence material during the months leading up to the Iraq war was spirited but unconvincing. Despite all the protestations of innocence by Mr. Blair and his aides, it is clear that his government embellished the truth in its stark warnings of an imminent Iraqi threat.</p>
        <p>Just as President Bush's State of the Union address went beyond hard intelligence in its assertions about the supposed Iraqi effort to purchase uranium from Niger, the intelligence dossier the Blair government released last September brazenly overreached in its claims that Iraq could field biological and chemical weapons within 45 minutes of Saddam Hussein's giving the order.</p>

        <p>The secret workings of Tony Blair's government have been on public display this month as a judicial inquiry has gathered testimony on the death, apparently by suicide, of a British weapons scientist, David Kelly. Yesterday, it was Mr. Blair's turn to testify. His defense of almost all aspects of his government's use of intelligence material during the months leading up to the Iraq war was spirited but unconvincing. Despite all the protestations of innocence by Mr. Blair and his aides, it is clear that his government embellished the truth in its stark warnings of an imminent Iraqi threat.</p>
        <p>Just as President Bush's State of the Union address went beyond hard intelligence in its assertions about the supposed Iraqi effort to purchase uranium from Niger, the intelligence dossier the Blair government released last September brazenly overreached in its claims that Iraq could field biological and chemical weapons within 45 minutes of Saddam Hussein's giving the order.</p>
        <p>In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Blair said the BBC had been wrong in reporting that his government had deliberately ''sexed up'' the dossier with dubious information, and he defended his top aides' vigorous efforts to refute the BBC charge. Those efforts led to the government's identification of Dr. Kelly as the BBC's probable source. Days later, Dr. Kelly was dead in what appeared to be a suicide.</p>
        <p>Yet in arguing that his office had intervened only in the packaging of the dossier and had left a senior intelligence adviser, John Scarlett, in charge of all substantive intelligence findings, Mr. Blair claimed an implausibly superfluous role for a leader preparing to take his nation to war. An e-mail note from Mr. Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, reported that the dossier had gone through a ''substantial rewrite'' to address points Mr. Blair had personally raised. Mr. Powell earlier told the inquiry that in mid-September last year he had warned Mr. Blair that it would be inaccurate to claim that Iraq posed an imminent threat. Yet one week later, in presenting the dossier to Parliament, Mr. Blair implied just that by saying Mr. Hussein's unconventional weapons programs were ''up and running.''</p>
        <p>The widespread belief in Britain that the government was deliberately misleading about the Iraqi threat explains Mr. Blair's recent downward plunge in the polls. Most Britons now say they no longer trust him to tell the truth. Regaining their trust will not be easy.</p>
