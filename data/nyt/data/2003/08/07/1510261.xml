        <p>Yahoo in Santa Clara, Calif., said yesterday that it had hired Soho Square, a new agency in New York being formed by the WPP Group to handle its account. Billings were estimated at $35 million to $45 million.</p>
        <p>For the last nine years, Black Rocket Euro RSCG in San Francisco, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas, has been Yahoo's agency.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a review that involved Black Rocket and at least one other WPP agency, Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising. Trade publications reported that another WPP agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, had also taken part, but Ogilvy, which works for a Yahoo rival, Terra Lycos, denied that.</p>
        <p>Soho Square, which will call on other WPP agencies for assistance on the account, will handle the Yahoo creative assignments formerly at Black Rocket, the creator of the popular ''Do You Yahoo?'' commercials that are half-sung, half-yodeled.</p>
        <p>Yahoo also named Soho Square to handle media planning and buying, which had been handled by Initiative Media in Los Angeles, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Talerman has been named to head Soho Square as managing partner. She had most recently been chief executive at her own company, Talerman &amp; Partners in New York. Before that, her posts included senior partner and account director at OgilvyOne, a division of Ogilvy.</p>
