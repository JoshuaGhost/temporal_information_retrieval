        <p>New York State is suing New York City, but only because the city did not get to court first. The governor and the Legislature are at war. The city is fighting for an aid package it did not even want at first. Even by Albany standards, the battle over a state aid package to help New York City balance its budget is one for the books.</p>
        <p>A series of political decisions, cascading down through the years in much the way the power failure cascaded through the electric grid last week, led to the current standoff.</p>
        <p>''This is the way New York State seems to do things,'' said Barbara Bartoletti, the legislative director for the New York State League of Women Voters. ''We are usually in a fine kettle of fish for one reason or another having to do with our dysfunctional government.''</p>
        <p>At stake is a plan to save the city half a billion dollars a year. If the deal is scuttled without a workable alternative, it will blow a hole in the city's precariously balanced budget, requiring more cuts or taxes. The battle has its roots in the repeal of the commuter tax, which was done in 1999 with the blessing of State Assembly Democrats from New York City who wanted to help sway a State Senate race that year. It has since cost the city more than a billion dollars.</p>
        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg decided not to call for the commuter tax's reinstatement until after Gov. George E. Pataki, his fellow Republican, won re-election last year. At that point, the governor and the State Senate refused even to consider it.</p>
        <p>The route to a state budget eliminated the chance for a compromise. Governor Pataki walked away from negotiations in the spring and left everything up to the Legislature, which passed a budget and a city aid package over his vetoes. Now Mr. Pataki has gone to court to try to undo the city aid package that was reached without him.</p>
        <p>To cap it off, all sides now agree that there is apparently an error in the way the city aid bill was drafted. Mark Page, the city's budget director, said in an affidavit released yesterday that the bill ''was enacted at the end of an intensely negotiated state budget process, as part of a large budget bill, and that it was drafted in considerable haste.'' That is, of course, business as usual in Albany.</p>
        <p>From a fiscal management point of view, the disputed deal does not have much to recommend it. It would save $500 million this year -- roughly the same amount the city would have gotten from the commuter tax -- by allowing the city to refinance its debt left over from the 1970's fiscal crisis. The state would then give the city the money, $170 million, to pay off the refinanced bonds.</p>
        <p>What that amounts to is making the generation that is just now being born pay off debt that is already about 25 years old. That disco era debt, which is just five years from being paid off, would be stretched out until the 2030's, with state taxpayers paying it back plus more than $2 billion in interest.</p>
        <p>Even when the plan was announced, one city official described it as a kind of ''Rube Goldberg contraption.'' The city was to form a corporation to borrow $2.5 billion to pay back the old debt. A state corporation called the Local Government Assistance Corporation, which gets its money from the state sales tax, would disburse $170 million a year for the next 30 years so the city could pay back the new bonds.</p>
        <p>But just as the city prepared to sell the first bonds, the board of the state corporation, which is made up of two Pataki appointees and State Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, voted this month not to send the money to the city. Then they filed a lawsuit to block the deal, and won a court order to stop the city's bond sale.</p>
        <p>''Pataki's criticisms of the deal are absolutely correct,'' said Jonathan Bowles, the research director of the Center for an Urban Future, a nonprofit public policy organization. ''But I fault the governor and the Legislature for not coming up with a better plan to help New York City.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday the city filed legal papers in State Supreme Court in Albany seeking permission to proceed with the refinancing deal. The city argued that any error in the aid package bill was unintentional and that the structure of the deal was legal.</p>
        <p>The city wants to lock in the state payment of $170 million a year because it knows that future lawmakers could try to renege on the deal made this year, and it wants to reassure investors that the bonds they buy will be paid back. The state law passed by the Legislature this spring establishing the deal says in one place that the state money is not subject to an annual appropriation in the state budget. But the State Constitution, both sides agree, requires that the budget authorize such expenditures each year.</p>
        <p>Michael A. Cardozo, the city's corporation counsel, argued yesterday that the line in question was an unintentional error. He said that the court should either interpret the law to require an annual appropriation, in line with the State Constitution, or strike the erroneous line and let the overall law stand.</p>
        <p>''We say, when you put all of this together, it can't possibly be that the Legislature tried to help New York City to the tune of this $500 million a year, intended to pass a statute and at the same time make it unconstitutional,'' he said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>The city argues that it would face ''irreparable harm'' if the sale is delayed, because interest rates are rising and each percentage point in the interest rate will cost the city corporation $25 million in interest on the deal.</p>
        <p>But Kevin Quinn, a spokesman for the governor's budget office, said, ''We continue to strongly believe that taxpayers and their children and grandchildren will face irreparable harm if this plan is allowed to move forward because they will be saddled with billions of dollars in unnecessary and avoidable costs.''</p>
        <p>It is a strange turn of events for the city to be fighting for this deal. For months this year it was Mayor Bloomberg who used the line about not saddling future generations with today's burdens. He wanted to tax commuters to get the people who use city services to pay for them. He has refused to do the exact kind of borrowing to pay for city services that he is now fighting for.</p>
        <p>But, many city officials say, the deal is necessary to compensate for a state error made four years ago -- the repeal of the city's commuter tax. It was a move rooted in the kind of pragmatic politics that Albany has become known for.</p>
        <p>The state's Democrats were trying to win a State Senate seat in 1999, an open seat in Rockland County. After the commuter tax became an issue in the race, Democrats decided to support its repeal. So, with the blessing of Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, and other city Democrats from the city, the tax was repealed. The Democrat lost the election anyway.</p>
        <p>New York City was left with a hole in its budget that appeared insignificant at first. Then, when the national recession hit and the city was attacked on Sept. 11, 2001, the hole mattered.</p>
        <p>A judge could rule on the legal case brought by the governor by Friday.</p>
