        <p>Depending on whom you ask, the blackout of 2003 is evidence of two opposite conclusions about the Indian Point nuclear reactors that sit about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan on the Hudson River.</p>

        <p>Depending on whom you ask, the blackout of 2003 is evidence of two opposite conclusions about the Indian Point nuclear reactors that sit about 35 miles north of Midtown Manhattan on the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>To Entergy, the company that owns them, the blackout is a sure sign that the New York metropolitan region cannot survive without the 2,000 megawatts of power the twin nuclear reactors pump out onto the electrical grid.</p>
        <p>''New York City and Westchester need power generated closer to home and need the plants like Indian Point that currently are providing electricity,'' Jim Steets, a spokesman for the plant, said on Monday.</p>
        <p>''None of us are taking any delight in having this outage, but I think it really is going to be much harder for those who have dismissed the value of these plants and demanded that Indian Point shut down.''</p>
        <p>But those who have advocated closing the plant said that it was disingenuous for Entergy to make that argument because a lack of electricity was not the direct cause of the blackout.</p>
        <p>''This blackout was caused by antiquated transmission systems, not supply,'' said Alex Matthiessen, executive director of the environmental group Riverkeeper, which is leading the charge to shut the plant down. ''It absolutely was not an energy supply issue.''</p>
        <p>The two reactors at Indian Point shut down as a result of the blackout that began on Thursday.</p>
        <p>One reactor, Indian Point 3, remains shut down as workers at the plant wait for the temperature in the reactor's cooling system to come down to 350 degrees so that repairs to wires inside the reactor can be made.</p>
        <p>The other reactor, Indian Point 2, was restarted on Sunday morning and gradually brought up to full power over the course of the day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthiessen said that far from demonstrating Indian Point's necessity to the region, the blackout showed that New York could manage without the energy the plant produces.</p>
        <p>''Indian Point 2 was off-line for most of the weekend, and it was a very warm weekend,'' Mr. Matthiessen said.</p>
        <p>''And Indian Point 3 is still off-line. If anything, this shows that we do not need these dangerous plants.''</p>
        <p>Ken Klapp, a spokesman for the New York Independent Systems Operator, a nonprofit organization established and regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said that neither side had it quite right.</p>
        <p>''The day of the incident, we had plenty of reserves available,'' Mr. Klapp said.</p>
        <p>''But we are running a fine line between our installed capacity and what we actually need. I think generally it just reinforces the need to reinforce existing transmission networks.''</p>
