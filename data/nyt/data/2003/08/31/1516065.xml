        <p>It's the bottom of the ninth for professional sports in New Jersey, and chances are growing slimmer by the day that Governor McGreevey can pull out a big victory for the home team.</p>
        <p>With the Devils and the Nets threatening to move across the Hudson River -- either to Long Island or Brooklyn -- the governor is trapped between two tough plays.</p>
        <p>If he exercises one option, he saves the taxpayers millions of dollars -- which he insists he will do -- but then waves goodbye as the two teams cross the George Washington Bridge. In that event, he is forever known as the governor who let professional sports leave New Jersey -- a very convenient line for opponents in political campaigns.</p>
        <p>(The Jets and Giants have never considered themselves New Jersey teams. As Richard Codey, the Democratic Senate co-president sees the issue of the Devils and the Nets, ''The people of the state are proud of the fact that they play here and wear New Jersey on their uniforms as opposed to our two football teams.'')</p>
        <p>Or Mr. McGreevey comes up with a creative deal and finds the money to keep the teams on this side of the river, perhaps adding some sky boxes and a train station to the Meadowlands or paving the way for a new arena in Newark. As a reward for this, he gets criticized for spending state money to subsidize dentally challenged millionaires on ice skates chasing pucks.</p>
        <p>The outlook isn't brilliant for the McGreevey team.</p>
        <p>''We are not going to provide subsidies for these teams,'' the governor insisted in an interview last week.</p>
        <p>So it would appear the governor is sticking to the first plan, but leaving his options open. In other words, he says he not about to open the state checkbook for the teams, though he will consider sprucing up the arena in the Meadowlands.</p>
        <p>Since taking office 18 months ago, Mr. McGreevey has pushed the idea of building a new arena as part of Newark redevelopment plan. Although he could not persuade the Legislature to put up money, he arranged for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the city of Newark to offer $210 million toward a new arena.</p>
        <p>The Sports and Exposition Authority, which owns Continental Arena, has also floated the idea of spending about $100 million on renovations, providing that the teams and the authority share any new revenue.</p>
        <p>The McGreevey camp contends that making improvements to the arena would not be subsidizing the teams since the state owns it. In addition, the state would share in the anticipated increase in revenue.</p>
        <p>The problem is the owners of the Nets and the Devils are complaining they are losing millions of dollars, and they are asking the state to sweeten the deal to keep them in New Jersey. In the meantime, they are also listening to proposals to move the teams to Brooklyn or Long Island.</p>
        <p>If things were not complicated enough, now there is a counter-bid to keep the teams in New Jersey. That comes from two of the governor's closest allies, Charles Kushner, a developer and major Democratic fund-raiser, and Senator Jon Corzine, he of deep pockets and mounting influence. Besides raising the specter of potential favoritism, the move adds the spectacle of a sitting United States senator negotiating a business deal with the state he represents.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Corzine recently made a public statement saying the state should not subsidize sports teams at the same time that he and Mr. Kushner were asking for conessions worth about $125 million.</p>
        <p>''There are a number of perspectives he is looking at it from,'' said Darius Goore, Mr. Corzine's spokesman. ''Obviously, as a senator, but also as a person from New Jersey who does not want to see the teams leave.''</p>
        <p>So far, the governor's people are betting that the teams will stay. James P. Fox, his chief of staff, says there is a long way to go before either New York deal can come to fruition.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Mr. Fox said in an interview , the teams would face several years of dismal revenue playing in New Jersey while waiting for a stadium to be built in New York.</p>
        <p>''Don't assume they are going anywhere,'' he said last week. ''This is a negotiation.''</p>
        <p>There is also some question of how much of a political hit the governor would take if the teams decided to pack up.</p>
        <p>''Almost 100 percent of callers don't care when I bring it up,'' said Jim Gearhart, the host of a popular morning radio show on NJ 101.5. ''Things involving those teams do not stir people up much.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Gearhart said the only response he gets is this: ''They don't want to pay for it. The feeling is, this is a business and if you can't make a go of it, it is not our fault.''</p>
        <p>Some people believe the governor could use that sentiment to his advantage. Pete McDonough, a former spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman, said Mr. McGreevey needs to make it clear that he is opposed to diverting taxpayer money into the pockets of wealthy team owners.</p>
        <p>''McGreevey has positioned himself well to say there will be no subsidies,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''Then if the teams leave, it is not because he let them go. It will be the teams left because they were greedy.''</p>
        <p>Senator Paul Sarlo, a Bergen County Democrat running for re-election in the heart of Devils country, said the voters will be smart enough to figure out what is going on.</p>
        <p>''Everybody realizes this is coming down to a wealthy team owner who is going to pick up his ball and go elsewhere,'' Mr. Sarlo said.</p>
