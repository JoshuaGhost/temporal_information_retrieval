        <p>It was getting on toward midnight, and the energy in the piano bar at Siro's, a restaurant in the shadow of the Saratoga Race Course had jumped about an octave. Older couples did a nimble foxtrot amid a crush of men in madras plaid who were busy offering drinks.</p>
        <p>Outside in the ''yard,'' a few people lingered under crisp white tents where earlier, throngs, fresh from the races, listened to live rock and downed raw oysters and clams. In the cool, softly lighted dining room, high rollers were done tucking into $48 veal chops, and a table of young women dressed in strappy dresses compared very sparkly, very large diamond rings.</p>
        <p>It was just another night at Siro's, but it was special nonetheless. Perhaps that's because there are so few of them.</p>
        <p>A Saratoga institution and stamping ground for equestrian-minded magnates, grandes dames, dandies and the occasional miscreant, Siro's is open during the racing season only, a six-week sprint that turns this city into a delirious blur of betting and revelry. In an often repeated line once uttered by a waiter, Siro's is where ''Goodfellas'' meets ''Gone With the Wind.''</p>
        <p>''It's definitely the place to be seen after the track, if you're anyone who's anyone,'' said a spokeswoman for the Saratoga County Chamber of Commerce, Annamaria Dalton, setting aside her vow of impartiality for a moment to convey the restaurant's import.</p>
        <p>This year there seems to be more jostling for tables than usual. Despite torrents of rain in the early weeks, the racetrack, now in its 135th season, is expecting this summer to be the biggest in history, with more than a million visitors. The interest is no doubt fed by the bestseller ''Seabiscuit'' by Laura Hillenbrand about the famous 1930's thoroughbred, and the movie he inspired.</p>
        <p>Siro's is behind the track on Lincoln Avenue in an unassuming white clapboard house, bathed in the soft blue light of an old neon sign. The restaurant has been party central during the racing season ever since the 1930's. That is when Jimmy Siro, a maître d'hôtel at the Waldorf-Astoria, bought a little Italian restaurant, changed the name and welcomed his well-heeled Manhattan customers up for some postrace carousing.</p>
        <p>Much has changed, of course. But broad-brimmed straw hats trimmed with long feathers still maneuver through the dining room, where the old New York families once had regular tables. Some still drop by. ''This was their little room,'' said the chef and co-owner, Tom J. Dillon, referring to the Rockefellers, Astors and Whitneys. ''Mary Lou Whitney ate here last week.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dillon, dressed in a peach linen shirt that perfectly matched the restaurant's interior, is one of five partners who have together owned Siro's since the mid-1980's. The rest of the year, Mr. Dillon oversees three dozen restaurants at racetracks and golf courses around the country. In truth, Siro's doesn't completely close for 46 weeks. It is shuttered in January, February and March. It handles about 15 private parties in the fall and five weddings in the spring and early summer.</p>
        <p>Historically, Siro's pulled waiters from Washington, New York City and Boston, where the restaurants were ''completely barren in August,'' Mr. Dillon said. Now, the waiters come east primarily from Las Vegas for the season at Siro's, returning in the fall. Several other staff members, including some chefs, work in St. Croix in the winter.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Dillon's toque blanche, the Siro's kitchen has received wide acclaim. The Los Angeles Times called Siro's the most famous trackside restaurant in America.</p>
        <p>'Every vegetable served at Siro's is in the ground in the morning,'' said Mr. Dillon, who once owned restaurants from the Hamptons to Maui. ''We raise our own lamb in Vermont. We dry-age our own beef.''</p>
        <p>Dinner is not cheap, averaging $100 a person (a temperate person, that is). The least expensive bottle of red on the wine list is $30. More than half the wines are priced at more than $90 a bottle.</p>
        <p>But fans of the restaurant, who cover the spectrum from horse trainers, owners and ''trackies'' to movie stars, politicians and socialites, apparently feel it is worth it. ''Siro's is the headquarters of Saratoga,'' said Bruce Blythe III, a lawyer from Louisville, Ky., who lost $100 at the track one day recently and kept his reservation anyway. ''After the last race everybody comes here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blythe, who once owned a racehorse who ''wasn't any good,'' had arrived in town for a long weekend with nine buddies. One was Dr. J. Cotton Shallcross, a gastroenterologist originally from Louisville.</p>
        <p>''For the observant horseplayer, it's a religious pilgrimage,'' Dr. Shallcross said of the trip to Saratoga. The group was reluctant to eat at Siro's because it is so expensive, he said. But one friend insisted, and so they settled for a 10 o'clock seating.</p>
        <p>Snagging a prime reservation -- the second seating during Travers Stakes week, say -- is akin to winning a trifecta. The phone starts ringing the day after the restaurant closes for the season with reservation requests for the following year, Mr. Dillon said. (This year, the restaurant will serve its last dinner tomorrow, Labor Day, the final day of races.)</p>
        <p>But Siro's does not start accepting reservations until Kentucky Derby Day, the first Saturday in May. ''We're 60 percent sold out before the season opens,'' Mr. Dillon said.</p>
        <p>''It's a world-famous restaurant for six weeks,'' said Tommy Porsche, a 49-year-old sports handicapper from Schenectady, holding a plastic cup of red wine ($6.50) in the ''yard,'' which resembled an Ivy League frat party of two or three decades ago. ''It's the best of the best. I'll eat here four or five times this summer.''</p>
        <p>For the owners, keeping the restaurant open for the racing season has proved profitable, creating a certain mystique and ensuring a stampede of would-be diners. A third seating is added during especially busy times like the weeks of the Travers and the annual Yearling Sales. ''We can turn away 100 dinners a night,'' Mr. Dillon said.</p>
        <p>During the season, the 130-seat restaurant serves about 9,000 dinners, not to mention all those raw oysters, he said. It did not hurt business when, in the mid-1990's, the New York Racing Association decided to extend the traditional monthlong season in August to six weeks.</p>
        <p>''It's an economic anomaly that works for us,'' said Thomas A. Anderson, a partner. ''As good a location as it is now, it's that bad in December.''</p>
