        <p>There were no lifeguards, no swimmers and no water. For the past 13 summers, all signs of life had been drained from the outdoor pool at the 59th Street Recreation Center, a 97-year-old Tudor Gothic building between 10th and 11th Avenues, which started out as a bathhouse.</p>
        <p>But this month, after years of community protests, the city agreed to renovate the center, which it owns, at a cost of nearly $30 million. Swimmers were ecstatic.</p>

        <p>There were no lifeguards, no swimmers and no water. For the past 13 summers, all signs of life had been drained from the outdoor pool at the 59th Street Recreation Center, a 97-year-old Tudor Gothic building between 10th and 11th Avenues, which started out as a bathhouse.</p>
        <p>But this month, after years of community protests, the city agreed to renovate the center, which it owns, at a cost of nearly $30 million. Swimmers were ecstatic.</p>
        <p>''It's the only place where kids can get wet on the West Side,'' said Pam Frederick, a member of Community Board 4. ''If you go to the Amsterdam Houses, you'll find a lot of people who learned how to swim there,'' she added, referring to a nearby housing project.</p>
        <p>The outdoor pool was rendered useless in 1990 because of nearby roadwork. The pool is now overgrown with weeds. As part of budget-cutting efforts, the city tried to close the center, which also has a gym, an exercise room, a climbing wall and an indoor pool used for lifeguard training. But community groups fought back.</p>
        <p>The center may have been saved for its nearly 3,000 members, but the former bathhouse slipped deeper into disrepair. ''Ask someone to give you a tour of the women's bathroom,'' Ms. Frederick said. ''It's disgusting. It's really ratty. And the outdoor pool just sits there like a carcass.''</p>
        <p>Nearly $5 million in public and private dollars has been raised so far, and will be used to shore up the structure, install heating and air-conditioning and build a new exercise wing. The largest chunk, $2.65 million, came from Tishman Speyer Properties, the real estate developer, in exchange for air-right bonuses for a residential tower at 101 West End Avenue, near 63rd Street.</p>
        <p>Fixing the pool and other improvements will cost an additional $20 million to $25 million. City officials are optimistic. ''Once you get that partnership, the rest is easier,'' said William T. Castro, the Manhattan commissioner for the city's Parks Department. ''People are committed now.''</p>
        <p>Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, who helped secure $1.4 million from the City Council, noted that the city and federal governments had pledged their continuing support to the center. To make up any difference, Ms. Brewer said she would seek private donations.</p>
        <p>Although it could be many years before the outdoor pool reopens, swimmers are already thinking about their first dip.</p>
        <p>''The pool was amazing,'' said Mary Rosado, a nearby resident who learned how to swim there and later founded the Friends of the 59th Street Recreation Center. ''I really miss that. The center looked like a little Coney Island.''</p>
