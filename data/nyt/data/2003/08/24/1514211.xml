Lew of Ossining, N.Y., retired as a mathematician at I.B.M.'s Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lorber, also 36, operates Aplomb Consulting in Burlington, Vt., and San Francisco, which advises AIDS and gay organizations on research and marketing. He is also a stand-up comedian in Burlington. He graduated from the University of California and received an M.B.A. from Stanford. His mother, Judith P. Lorber, lives in Long Beach, Calif., and is a substitute teacher in its public elementary schools. His father, Dr. Morris L. Lorber of Torrance, Calif., is a retired neurologist who practiced in Gardena, Calif.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lew and Mr. Lorber met at a San Francisco synagogue in 1999, when Mr. Lorber entered to find a packed house and took the only available seat, next to Dr. Lew. They chatted during breaks in the service.</p>
        <p>''When we talked, it was like he was reading off my checklist,'' Mr. Lorber recalled. ''I thought, 'Wow! He meets all the criteria.' ''</p>
