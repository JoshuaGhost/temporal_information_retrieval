      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Thousands of people in western Canada were forced to evacuate their homes because of fast-spreading forest fires, considered the worst in the last half-century. In one area of southern British Columbia, near Kamloops, about 180 miles northeast of Vancouver, 10,000 people from mostly rural communities were evacuated, while forecasts for more hot, dry weather stoked fears that the fires could spread. Nearly 2,000 residents from the mountainous region of southwestern Alberta have also been evacuated. Hundreds of firefighters from around the country have been called in to fight the 380 fires, some of them burning for more than a week.</p>
