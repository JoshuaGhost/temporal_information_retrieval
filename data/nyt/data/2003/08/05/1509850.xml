        <p>Funny Cide fever has finally extended to the horse himself -- he was running one today after a third-place finish Sunday in the $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park. Funny Cide, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, was back here today and had a temperature of 102 degrees. He also had a closed eye after having sand kicked in it, and was said to be exhausted.</p>
        <p>Will the highly anticipated rematch between the New York-bred gelding Funny Cide and the regally-bred Empire Maker come off in the Travers Stakes on Aug. 23? ''I honestly don't know,'' said Funny Cide's trainer, Barclay Tagg. ''The Travers is 20 days away.''</p>

        <p>It is uncertain whether the highly anticipated rematch between Funny Cide and Empire Maker will come off in the Travers Stakes this month.</p>

        <p>Funny Cide fever has finally extended to the horse himself -- he was running one today after a third-place finish Sunday in the $1 million Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park. Funny Cide, the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, was back here today and had a temperature of 102 degrees. He also had a closed eye after having sand kicked in it, and was said to be exhausted.</p>
        <p>Will the highly anticipated rematch between the New York-bred gelding Funny Cide and the regally-bred Empire Maker come off in the Travers Stakes on Aug. 23? ''I honestly don't know,'' said Funny Cide's trainer, Barclay Tagg. ''The Travers is 20 days away.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Funny Cide broke from the gate at Monmouth, fought with his jockey, Jose Santos, around the first turn, then more or less quit after three-quarters of a mile. Twenty minutes earlier in the Jim Dandy here, Empire Maker lagged behind the field, made a slingshot move around the far turn and stalled. Jockey Jerry Bailey gunned him again, but Empire Maker, the Belmont Stakes winner, was unable to overtake the front-running Strong Hope at the wire and finished second.</p>
        <p>Neither Funny Cide nor Empire Maker turned in the dramatic first and second act that horse racing enthusiasts had hoped for. In the summer of Seabiscuit, most were desperate to see some transcendent sort of match race in the Travers that would conjure the great old horse's duel with War Admiral.</p>
        <p>But racing cannot be scripted, especially when 3-year-olds are involved. They are like adolescents, with croaking voices and growing pains that keep them up at night. The precocious ones sometime show themselves too early -- Empire Maker blew away a Florida Derby field and looked like a worldbeater. Two months later in the Kentucky Derby, he gawked and goofed his way around the oval at Churchill Downs and lost to Funny Cide.</p>
        <p>Funny Cide, on the other hand, looked to have more determination than talent, finishing third in the Louisiana Derby to Peace Rules, the colt who won the Haskell on Sunday. Funny Cide was also unable to hold off Empire Maker in the Wood Memorial in April. But all of a sudden on the first Saturday in May, Funny Cide showed up in the paddock muscled, alert and confident, much like a college football player does as a sophomore after a year in the weight room and enough late-night sessions to master the playbook.</p>
        <p>There is a reason the summer stakes races for 3-year-olds are called the second season and why the Travers is considered the Midsummer Derby. It is a time for the late starters as well as the late bloomers. By the time Strong Hope ran his first race in March, Empire Maker had already competed in three races.</p>
        <p>Since then, Strong Hope, the colt trained by Todd Pletcher, has won five of six races in scintillating fashion, while Empire Maker has won two of four.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, the story here is that here's a horse that's won five in a row that keeps getting better, not the fact that Empire Maker lost,'' said Pletcher, who intends to run Strong Hope in the Travers.</p>
        <p>Sky Mesa made just his second start as a 3-year-old and finished second to Peace Rules in the Haskell. Last year, the colt was 3 for 3, romped in the Grade I Hopeful and was sidelined in the days before the Breeders' Cup Juvenile after he was made the morning-line favorite. He, too, is expected at the Midsummer Derby, as is the Belmont runner-up, Ten Most Wanted.</p>
        <p>The field, however, will be without Peace Rules. The trainer Bobby Frankel has decided to run him in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar on Aug. 24, rather than send him against his stablemate Empire Maker.</p>
        <p>Empire Maker is the early favorite to win the Travers. He looked good losing, and Frankel said he learned something important about him: Empire Maker remains a distracted adolescent.</p>
        <p>''I think he wants to be in a fight all the way; I think in all his races he runs better when he's right there,'' Frankel said. ''He can keep up with fast fractions. I think we learned he doesn't like to be hit that much.''</p>
        <p>As for Funny Cide, Santos said that he did not like the surface, in this case a fast one, at Monmouth, the same explanation he offered after finishing third on a sloppy track at Belmont Park. Around the racetrack, that means the horse has been beaten decisively, and neither the trainer nor jockey knows why.</p>
        <p>Maybe Funny Cide did take ill before the race. As Tagg explained, a horse's temperature varies from 99 degrees in the morning to 101 in the late afternoon, and 102 does not seem to be overly alarming. Maybe having sand kicked in his face took out his fight.</p>
        <p>It's more likely, however, that the Triple Crown campaign soured Funny Cide. He deserved to be tired after three races in five weeks. In fighting with Santos in the early part of the race, Funny Cide did not look like a happy horse.</p>
        <p>It would not be a surprise if the ever-cautious Tagg advised the ebullient owners of Sackatoga Stable to skip the Midsummer Derby. It might flatten the sales of Funny Cide beer, wine and doughnuts, but it would allow the gelding to rest and grow up, and it just might ensure a long racing career.</p>
        <p>This is not Hollywood, just horse racing, and more often than not the stars of the spring's Triple Crown have to make room for the boys of summer.</p>
