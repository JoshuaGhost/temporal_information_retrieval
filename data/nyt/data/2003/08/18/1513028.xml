        <p>Israeli and Palestinian commanders failed to reach an agreement over Israel's planned transfer of control over two West Bank towns to the Palestinians, even though both sides had shown some new flexibility in an effort to thwart a feared outbreak of violence.</p>
        <p>Negotiators canceled talks for today and said they would meet again tomorrow, and an Israeli security official said the talks were being conducted with ''good spirits.''</p>
        <p>But Palestinian officials sounded more concerned, saying that the Israelis had disappointed them by refusing to yield checkpoints controlling access through an Israeli barrier to one of the cities, Qalqilya. They said the Israeli generals had requested time to discuss the matter with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and other top political officials.</p>
        <p>The other affected town, Jericho, did not appear to pose a problem for the negotiators.</p>
