        <p>Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose consulting firm examined the thoroughbred racing industry, urged its officials today to form a national office to monitor security and standards for the parimutuel wagering system.</p>
        <p>Security in the system became an issue last year after three men manipulated computerized bets on the Breeders' Cup pick six on Oct. 26 for a $3 million payoff. They pleaded guilty and did not receive the money.</p>
        <p>Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, and his consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, were hired by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association to examine the system and today, in conjunction with the racing association's Wagering Technology Working Group, released their report at the Jockey Club Round Table, an industry gathering.</p>
        <p>The report also warned that the threat from computer hackers would remain ever present.</p>
        <p>''My confidence is based on the report,'' Giuliani said. ''No systematic pattern of fraud was found.'' The fraud that was uncovered, he said, was ''isolated conduct, but not unusual.''</p>
        <p>''It's no different from what they face in the banking business or securities industry,'' Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>The report said that a National Office of Wagering Security should be in place by the first half of 2004, under a chief security officer with ''cybersecurity expertise.''</p>
        <p>''The process of security development, however, is just that: a process,'' the report said. ''The industry must continue to develop strategies and programs that will enable it to identify and rebuff other attempts at wagering fraud.''</p>
        <p>The report also recommended establishing ''minimum, uniform security standards in the parimutuel system.'' Its final recommendation is for ''an upgrade of the current wagering system infrastructure.''</p>
        <p>''Recommendations one and two really go together,'' said Tim Smith, the commissioner of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. ''They are nothing that other industries in electrical commerce aren't already doing. They won't be as onerous initially as some of the tote companies and operators fear. Neither is terribly difficult or terribly costly.''</p>
        <p>A technology update would affect groups like the New York Racing Association, Churchill Downs and Magna Entertainment, the nation's three largest racetrack owners.</p>
        <p>''While it might be more costly, and take a few months more to implement, it's also imminently doable,'' Smith said. ''We're not talking about a complete rewiring of the industry. And eventually, the system upgrades may pay for themselves.''</p>
        <p>This year's round table was held with the racing industry under increased scrutiny, especially in New York, where Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and the state's comptroller, Alan Hevesi, have questioned the N.Y.R.A.'s business practices in two recent reports.</p>
        <p>In addition, federal prosecutors are investigating New York's racing association to determine if top managers engaged in a conspiracy to commit tax fraud. The inquiry stems from the convictions of 16 betting clerks for cheating on their taxes and centers on whether the racing association could have prevented their actions.</p>
        <p>Some horse owners and trainers say New York's strategy of investing in the industry and tracks has worked. As annual purses increased by nearly $36 million from 1994 to 2002, the tracks regained some of their prestige, they say.</p>
        <p>John Ward, the trainer of Monarchos, the 2001 Kentucky Derby winner, and a former member of the Kentucky Racing Commission, said New York should not turn its tracks over to private hands.</p>
        <p>''We've raced all over the country, and this is the epitome of high quality, good purses, as well as tradition,'' he said. ''I would shudder to think how a for-profit corporation would run it. It would be of a lower standard.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Sand Springs, the favorite, held off the late-charging Indy Five Hundred by three-quarters of a length to win the Grade II Lake Placid Stakes for 3-year-old fillies on the turf on Sunday. Ridden by MARK GUIDRY and trained by ANTHONY REINSTEDLER, Sand Springs led from gate to wire.</p>
