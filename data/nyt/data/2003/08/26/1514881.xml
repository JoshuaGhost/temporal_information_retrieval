        <p>They passed the afternoon in the Greenlawn home of a family friend, crying and telling stories about Betty Alfaro, 21, and her two girls, Katy, 5 months, and Jennifer, who was nearly 2 years old, who died early Sunday morning in the fire as the girls' father and an off-duty police officer tried in vain to save them.</p>

        <p>As investigators continued searching for a cause in the fire that killed a mother and her two daughters, relatives of the victims gathered today to grieve and wait for a phone call informing them the three bodies were ready to be buried.</p>
        <p>They passed the afternoon in the Greenlawn home of a family friend, crying and telling stories about Betty Alfaro, 21, and her two girls, Katy, 5 months, and Jennifer, who was nearly 2 years old, who died early Sunday morning in the fire as the girls' father and an off-duty police officer tried in vain to save them.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time we've gone through something like this,'' said Jose Alfaro, 29, Ms. Alfaro's uncle.</p>
        <p>The police cars and stricken family members and friends who had flocked to the 100-year-old house were gone this afternoon. In the late afternoon, the house was being boarded up.</p>
        <p>Detective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick of the Suffolk County police said today that nothing about the fire seemed suspicious. The fire apparently began on the first floor of the home, he said, and the home did not seem to have smoke detectors.</p>
        <p>Two other families lived in the house, but Bruce Richard, Huntington's director of public safety, said there appeared to be no violations of town laws governing occupancy because all of the occupants were related. He said there were no records of complaints against the home.</p>
        <p>Around 5:25 a.m. Sunday, Ms. Alfaro's husband, Melvin Perichi, 19, who had fallen asleep on the couch, was awakened by the smell of smoke, the police said. He was unable to reach his wife and daughters in a bedroom at the front of the house, the police said.</p>
        <p>Another family living in the basement escaped without injury, and Mr. Perichi was taken to Huntington Hospital and treated for smoke inhalation. He was released at 2:30 p.m. today, a hospital operator said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perichi's mother, who owns the home, and her husband and two teenage daughters were in Chicago when the fire struck, relatives said.</p>
        <p>Today, relatives retraced Ms. Alfaro's life, beginning with her childhood in El Salvador. Her mother fled the country in the mid-1980's to escape the 12-year civil war, and a decade later, Ms. Alfaro, her brother and sister flew to New York to reunite with their mother, said Ms. Alfaro's sister, Delsy Alfaro.</p>
        <p>The family lived in Huntington, where Ms. Alfaro attended high school, learned to speak English and began dating Mr. Perichi. Shortly after graduating from high school, she learned she was pregnant.</p>
        <p>It was unexpected news, but Ms. Alfaro embraced it, relatives said.</p>
        <p>''The kids were the center of her existence,'' said Mr. Alfaro, her uncle.</p>
        <p>Mother and daughters spent their days together, strolling to the park or around the neighborhood, relatives said.</p>
        <p>At night, Ms. Alfaro and her husband shared a double bed while their daughters lay near, one in a crib and the other in a small bed.</p>
        <p>''Their mother wanted to spend time with them, and she wanted to be with them,'' Mr. Alfaro said.</p>
        <p>As they talked about the victims, memories came back in spurts. Relatives recalled how Ms. Alfaro excelled in American history classes in school, and the way Jennifer pointed at nearly everything, from flowers to pictures to her mother and exclaimed, ''Oh look, it's pretty!''</p>
        <p>Town officials said this was the deadliest fire since May 1999, when a Salvadoran man set fire to a converted commercial building filled with 33 Salvadoran immigrants, killing four people, including a mother and daughter.</p>
        <p>The 1999 blaze focused attention on homes crammed with immigrants and seasonal workers and prompted Huntington to hire two Spanish-speaking code enforcement officers, Mr. Richard said. Huntington has since created a code violations bureau to examine housing violations and has hired an assistant town attorney to prosecute code violations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richard said this fire did not seem to raise those same concerns about overcrowding or housing-code violations.</p>
        <p>''Anytime there is a tragedy like this, we always look at how we do things to see if there's something we can do to prevent something like this in the future,'' Mr. Richard said. ''But you're going to have tragedies.''</p>
