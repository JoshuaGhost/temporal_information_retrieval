        <p>Alvin Gentry's roster of young, talented players just kept losing, and that cost him his job as coach of the Los Angeles Clippers yesterday.</p>
        <p>Gentry was fired with 24 games left in another disappointing season. Dennis Johnson, one of his assistants, replaced him.</p>
        <p>The Clippers took a five-game losing streak and a 19-39 record into last night's game against New Orleans. They were last in the Pacific Division and had blown 20 games when holding a fourth-quarter lead.</p>
        <p>''These decisions are never easy, and this one is especially tough, because Alvin and I had a very good working relationship,'' the team vice president, Elgin Baylor, said. ''But I reached the conclusion Sunday night that the players simply were not responding, and I believe a change is necessary at this time.''</p>
        <p>Johnson, 48, won three N.B.A. titles with Seattle and Boston during his 14-year playing career. He was in his fourth season as a Clippers assistant.</p>
        <p>Gentry, hired before the 2000-1 season, had a 89-133 record. Before that, he was 73-72 as coach of the Detroit Pistons. He also coached the Miami Heat, in between 10 seasons as an assistant with three N.B.A. teams.</p>
        <p>Gentry, 48, was the Clippers' fourth coach in six seasons. The team last made the playoffs in the 1996-97 season, under Bill Fitch.</p>
        <p>The Clippers opened this season with a 5-10 record and slumped to 17-32 by the All-Star Game break. They were frequently booed at home, where they are 12-19.</p>
        <p>Adding to the Clippers' woes have been numerous injuries, and questions about whether their owner, Donald Sterling, will keep the team together next season. Elton Brand, Lamar Odom, Michael Olowokandi, Corey Maggette and Andre Miller are all free agents after the season.</p>
        <p>Brand, the team's leading scorer, has a stress fracture in his left leg and is day to day. He missed three consecutive games going into last night's game.</p>
        <p>CELTICS 111, GRIZZLIES 110: Paul Pierce, who missed Boston's last two games with lower back pain, scored 31 points and rabbed 13 rebounds last night as the Celtics won in Memphis.</p>
        <p>Pierce connected on 12 of 19 from the field as the Celtics won for the third time in four games. The loss snapped a three-game home winning streak for the Grizzlies.</p>
        <p>Memphis was within 3 points, 108-105, when Jason Williams missed a layup and Pau Gasol missed the follow-up jam with 26 seconds left. Tony Battie made one free throw and J.R. Bremer two for Boston before a 3-pointer by Memphis's Shane Battier with under a second remaining accounted for the final score.</p>
        <p>Gasol's 23 points and 17 rebounds paced seven Grizzlies scored finished in double figures.</p>
        <p>MAGIC 104, BULLS 89: Tracy McGrady shot just 6 of 19 but scored 26 points - 8 in the final 4 minutes 45 seconds - tied his career high with 13 assists and had 9 rebounds as the Magic won in Chicago and recorded its sixth victory in seven games.</p>
        <p>Pat Garrity scored 21 points, Gordon Giricek 18, Darrell Armstrong 14 and Drew Gooden 13 for the Magic. Jalen Rose led the Bulls with 24 points and Donyell Marshall had 15.</p>
        <p>KINGS 107, 76ERS 99: Chris Weber had 29 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists as host Sacramento snapped Philadelphia's ' season-best nine-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>Allen Iverson had 35 points, 5 rebounds, 5 steals and 4 assists as the Sixers lost for the first time since the All-Star break.</p>
        <p>Iverson scored six straight points during a late 8-0 run, including a 3-pointer with 3:34 left that pulled Philadelphia within 94-92. The Sixers took the lead briefly at 95-94 but couldn't hold it.</p>
        <p>Peja Stojakovic made two key baskets and Doug Christie scored off a steal of the sixers' inbounds pass following a timeout.</p>
        <p>HEAT'S JONES OUT: Miami guard Eddie Jones, who leads the Heat with an average of 18.5 points a game, re-injured his right ankle in practice yesterday and is out for at least two weeks.</p>
        <p>Jones sprained his ankle when he came down on teammate Rasual Butler's foot. Jones will wear a cast for two weeks and then be re-evaluated, the team said. Butler will probably replace him in the starting lineup tonight against Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>REBRACA'S CAREER MAY BE OVER: Detroit Pistons center Zeljko Rebraca may quit basketball because of an irregular heartbeat that has sidelined him for more than two months.</p>
        <p>Rebraca has been going through limited practices since leaving a Dec. 21 game against the Nets because of an accelerated pulse. The 31-year-old Rebraca said he was considering heart surgery to eliminate the problem after consulting with doctors in the United States.</p>
