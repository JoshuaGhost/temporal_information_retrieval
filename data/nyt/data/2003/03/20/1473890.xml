        <p>It was a fraud that went on for more than 15 years, complete with ''family meetings'' to create records to fool the auditors, who seem never to have caught on that something was amiss, even as a company that was barely breaking even was reporting more than $1 billion in nonexistent profits.</p>
        <p>That, in any case, is what the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission say went on at HealthSouth, the health care company run by Richard M. Scrushy, who is said to have directed the fraud. HealthSouth's former chief financial officer has agreed to enter a guilty plea and to cooperate with investigators.</p>
        <p>In some ways, this case is unusual. While most accounting fraud cases filed by the S.E.C. come months or even years after inaccurate accounting is disclosed, the public had virtually no idea of the scope or magnitude of the case before charges were filed yesterday.</p>
        <p>While it had been known that federal officials were investigating HealthSouth, that inquiry was thought to deal with the company's disclosure of the effect of new Medicare regulations. But the government says that those regulations had a far smaller effect on HealthSouth than executives contended and that the company exaggerated the effect to lower Wall Street expectations without admitting fraud.</p>
        <p>This case is also unusual in that it represents the first charges filed under the Sarbanes-Oxley law's requirement that top corporate executives certify financial statements. Indeed, the S.E.C. said enactment of the law helped cause the fake Medicare statement.</p>
        <p>But in other ways, the HealthSouth case echoed many earlier accounting fraud cases, dating back to that of Equity Funding in 1973. In that case, the company faked sales of mutual funds and insurance policies, with nighttime gatherings to create fraudulent records to fool the auditors.</p>
        <p>In this case, the S.E.C. and the Justice Department contend that Mr. Scrushy and other officials knew that auditors would usually not check accounting entries below a certain amount, and tried to keep false entries below those levels. In the computer age, they did not need to sit around with different-colored pens creating records, as took place at Equity Funding, but they did have to create a computer record that auditors would not find suspicious.</p>
        <p>In one case, the S.E.C. said, auditors asked about an addition to assets at a HealthSouth installation. The company altered an invoice, which reflected the purchase of a real asset, to show that its price was higher than it really was. When the auditors asked for a ledger listing all the fixed assets at a particular place, the company created a fake ledger.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. said the fraud began shortly after the company went public in 1986. From 1999 through 2001, it said, HealthSouth reported profit before taxes and minority interest of $1.22 billion while the correct amount was $12 million. The commission added that more false profits were reported in the first six months of 2002, increasing the total fraud to $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Scrushy said he was ''shocked and surprised'' by the accusations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scrushy took in $143 million over the years from selling stock, apparently making a gain of $77 million after subtracting what he paid for shares. Just last September, he exercised options for $4 million worth of stock, in what was seen as a vote of confidence in the company.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Scrushy last bought stock, the company was under fire from investors and others for not disclosing earlier that a change in Medicare rules would cost it $175 million a year in profits. In fact, the S.E.C. said in its complaint, the company's accounting personnel estimated that the real cost would be $20 million to $30 million. It said the company issued the exaggerated figure because Mr. Scrushy wanted to reduce Wall Street expectations and the need to inflate profits to meet them.</p>
        <p>HealthSouth's financial statements were audited for many years by Ernst &amp; Young, which issued a statement yesterday saying that it was cooperating with the S.E.C. and noting that the commission said auditors had been misled.</p>
        <p>For Ernst, the case is in some ways reminiscent of the fraud at CUC International, which the government claims occurred from 1983 until it was discovered in 1998, after CUC merged into the Cendant Corporation. Cendant has sued Ernst &amp; Young, which was CUC's auditor, contending that it knew of the fraud and covered it up.</p>
        <p>Ernst has denied that and has not faced S.E.C. or Justice Department suits, although it did pay $335 million to settle a shareholders' suit. CUC's former chief financial officer has pleaded guilty to fraud charges, and its two top officers are to go on trial on similar charges early in 2004.</p>
        <p>There is nothing in the charges filed yesterday to indicate that Ernst auditors knew of the problem at HealthSouth. The S.E.C. noted that many of the false entries dealt with changing estimates for how much of patients' bills would be paid by health insurers, and it says that was a difficult number to verify.</p>
        <p>For HealthSouth, dealing with yesterday's legal proceedings may not be the most pressing matter. The company has a $354 million bond issue maturing on April 1, less than two weeks from now. That is $35 million less than all the cash on hand the company said it had at the end of September, the last time it issued a balance sheet. But the government says that in the past, HealthSouth overstated its cash by more than $300 million.</p>
        <p>A HealthSouth spokesman declined to discuss the company's liquidity yesterday. But with these charges pending, it could be very hard for it to raise money now, even on existing lines of credit.</p>
        <p>Prices of HealthSouth bonds plunged yesterday, with some trading for little more than half their face value. But Wall Street had not understood that an S.E.C. ban on trading HealthSouth securities applied to bonds as well as the stock, and all trades after 9:30 a.m. were ordered canceled.</p>
        <p>The stock, which closed at $3.91 on Tuesday, had traded as high as $30.81 in 1998. The suspension on trading will expire at midnight today.</p>
