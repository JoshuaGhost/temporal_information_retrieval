      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the Islamic-based political party that rules Turkey, assumed the post of prime minister today and assembled a new government against a backdrop of national anxiety over a possible war in Iraq.</p>
        <p>With the appointment of Mr. Erdogan, Turkey now has as the head of its government a politician who has advocated the deployment of American troops in the country for an invasion of northern Iraq. American officials are pressing hard for such permission, which the Turkish Parliament denied in a narrow vote two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Erdogan did not mention any timetable for a new, second vote, and Turkish officials said one was unlikely before Tuesday or Wednesday. Even then, they said, a second vote was not guaranteed.</p>
        <p>The departing foreign minister, Yasar Yakis, told reporters in Ankara, the capital, that Mr. Erdogan ''would be gauging the support for a second motion before deciding whether to refer it to the Parliament.''</p>
        <p>American officials have promised Turkey $6 billion if it cooperates, and their campaign to persuade Turkey has not relented. On Thursday, the American ambassador here handed Mr. Erdogan a letter from President Bush, which was followed by a telephone call from Vice President Dick Cheney. Officials familiar with those appeals said that the president and vice president were urging that the United States at least be given permission to use Turkish airspace, which it has not yet received.</p>
        <p>But these officials said that Mr. Erdogan had made no assurances that such permission was coming, or even that a final decision about it would be made in the next few days.</p>
        <p>Perhaps reflecting that uncertainty, the Pentagon has begun moving ships from the Mediterranean near Turkey to the Red Sea, where those ships could launch missiles toward Iraq that would not cross Turkey.</p>
        <p>The appointment of Mr. Erdogan as prime minister capped a turbulent career over the last five years. Mr. Erdogan, 49, was a prominent member of an overtly Islamic party when he was convicted and jailed in the late 1990's for inciting religious hatred. He was also banned for years from political office in Turkey.</p>
        <p>But he refashioned himself as a more pragmatic leader who publicly relegated his religion to the sidelines. In November, he led the Justice and Development Party, which he founded, to a sweeping victory in parliamentary elections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erdogan was appointed after the Turkish president approved a list of 23 cabinet members he submitted today. They include Abdullah Gul, a close ally who had served as prime minister for the last few months, as the new foreign minister.</p>
