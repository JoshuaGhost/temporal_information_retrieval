        <p>For Mark Siegel, the first sign of trouble was the giant inflatable rat. Sitting at the 43rd Street entrance to the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, it was said rodent -- and not the sound of tap, tap, tapping feet -- that greeted Mr. Siegel and the 17 students he had brought from Sheridan, Ore., to see last night's performance of the dance-happy musical ''42nd Street.''</p>
        <p>''We had had a wonderful day,'' said Mr. Siegel, who was leading a class trip to New York and Chicago. ''And then we came here, and this is what we found.''</p>

        <p>For Mark Siegel, the first sign of trouble was the giant inflatable rat. Sitting at the 43rd Street entrance to the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, it was said rodent -- and not the sound of tap, tap, tapping feet -- that greeted Mr. Siegel and the 17 students he had brought from Sheridan, Ore., to see last night's performance of the dance-happy musical ''42nd Street.''</p>
        <p>''We had had a wonderful day,'' said Mr. Siegel, who was leading a class trip to New York and Chicago. ''And then we came here, and this is what we found.''</p>
        <p>The rat, set up by representatives of the musicians' union, signaled the onset of a nasty labor battle between the union and Broadway producers, a dispute that led to the cancellation of 18 Broadway musicals last night, including ''42nd Street.''</p>
        <p>''I love this show, and I wanted to end the trip on a real up note,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''I wanted to give them a unique Broadway experience.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, that's exactly what Mr. Siegel did. Not since the Broadway strike of 1975, which lasted three weeks, has the theater industry been gripped by such a serious labor dispute. All across Broadway, producers were fielding worried calls from investors who watched newscasts showing picket lines and chanting protesters, not happy audience members, standing in front of theaters.</p>
        <p>Ticket sellers, meanwhile, were watching their switchboards light up as theater groups frantically tried to determine if the shows would go on.</p>
        <p>''The second week in March is when we begin to see a serious increase in bookings,'' said Ronald S. Lee, the president of Group Sales Box Office, which sells large blocks of tickets to consumers. ''Come Monday, we're going to be swamped by calls.''</p>
        <p>For many ticket buyers, however, the problem was much more immediate. Neil Mandell, 55, a textile executive, had traveled to the city from Yardley, Pa., with his wife, Sharan, to take in a couple of Broadway shows, a dinner and a night on the town.</p>
        <p>They got the bad news during dessert.</p>
        <p>''Dinner was fine till the waitress told us our show was canceled,'' said Mr. Mandell, who estimated the whole trip would set him back $1,000. His wife was crestfallen.</p>
        <p>They had heard something about a possible strike but decided they would go ahead and come to the city, even if it meant seeing a show with a prerecorded ''virtual orchestra'' rather than live musicians.</p>
        <p>''We've been to dinner theater with canned music,'' Mr. Mandell said. ''So we're used to it.''</p>
        <p>His wife agreed. ''We weren't thrilled,'' she said, about the idea of a virtual orchestra, ''but now we're devastated.''</p>
        <p>Jed Bernstein, the president of the League of American Theaters and Producers, said the decision to cancel the entire weekend of shows while negotiations continued had been made to prevent situations like the Mandells'.</p>
        <p>''We have an obligation to our customers to inform them of the situation and to be clear with them far enough in advance so they can change their plans,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many theatergoers seemed to be doing exactly that. In a city, and an industry, where one show's loss can be another's gain, not all were doing badly. Several Off Broadway shows, especially those playing close to the theater district, reported increases in sales. Famed Broadway restaurant Joe Allen also reported being busier than usual. Six Broadway plays and ''Def Poetry Jam'' were also open, as was the musical ''Cabaret,'' which because of the building in which it plays -- Studio 54 -- has a different contract with the musicians' union.</p>
        <p>Not only did the strike interrupt shows that were already open, but it also halted work on several major musicals in rehearsal or early preview performances, in which shows often undergo radical changes.</p>
        <p>One of those is ''Urban Cowboy,'' a new musical based on the 1980 movie, which is in preview and scheduled to open on March 27, but could be delayed if a strike drags on too long. Several actors from that show gathered outside in support of the musicians before last night's canceled preview.</p>
        <p>Nearby, Gordon Titcomb, 50, who plays banjo and steel guitar for the show, was more outspoken: ''Virtual theater doesn't cost $100 a night. It costs $26 a month and it's called cable TV.''</p>
        <p>Many of the disappointed theatergoers said they sympathized with the musicians' plight. But not everyone did. Paul and Debbie Martino, who live in Parsippany, N.J., said they had come to see ''Thoroughly Modern Millie'' at the Marquis Theater but were shocked and offended by the cancellation.</p>
        <p>''To tell you the truth, I am a little angry at the musicians,'' Mr. Martino said. ''They didn't think about the people.''</p>
        <p>Most of those in Mr. Siegel's class said they were upset to be going home to Oregon without seeing ''42nd Street.''</p>
        <p>''I'm bummed,'' said Sam Kretchmar, 16, who is in his school's coming production of ''Kiss Me, Kate.'' ''I was going to take notes on the dancing.''</p>
