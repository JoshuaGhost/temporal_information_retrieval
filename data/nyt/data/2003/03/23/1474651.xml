        <p>GASPAR NOÉ'S ''Irréversible,'' which opened in the United States this month after variously sickening and enthralling audiences in France, has provoked a predictable, yet interesting, range of responses. The movie relates, with a backward chronology similar to ''Memento,'' the brutal rape of a woman and the equally violent revenge her current and former lovers inflict on a man they mistakenly believe to be her attacker.</p>
        <p>Critics are now arguing about whether Mr. Noé, who depicts the rape in an unflinching nine-minute take, is a shameless provocateur or a brave artistic rebel -- whether the extreme violence he shows has an ethical or intellectual value, or is a gratuitous exercise in shock.</p>
        <p>This debate is but the latest ripple from the bloody splash made more than 35 years ago by ''Bonnie and Clyde.'' The gunshots that killed those two robbers in Arthur Penn's gangster saga have echoed down the decades, through serious art and cynical exploitation, from ''The Wild Bunch'' to ''Dirty Harry'' to ''Reservoir Dogs.'' The arguments tend to treat violence as a particular type of action without considering motive or context.</p>
        <p>But motive and context matter enormously: the assault in a Paris underpass in ''Irréversible,'' like the violence that permeates Roman Polanski's wartime Warsaw in ''The Pianist,'' can be described as random. It seems to come out of nowhere, and to select its victims indiscriminately. But if the arbitrariness of the rape is what makes it seem gratuitous, the irrational perversity belongs to the filmmaker. In ''The Pianist,'' though, the killings and beatings that erupt without warning are part of a program of political terror, part of how a totalitarian regime maintains power. It is not Mr. Polanski who is so cruel and perverse to his characters, but history.</p>
        <p>Screen violence provides the kind of visceral impact that filmmakers, for reasons that can be honorable, meretricious or simply inscrutable, seek to provide. Ambitious directors have always tried to transport viewers beyond mere seeing and hearing into feeling. The orchestration of simulated violence is a favored formal experiment, in which the capacities of both audience and filmmaker are tested: how much can they show? How much can we take?</p>
        <p>And in the name of what? One argument is always that, since violence is pervasive, movies that depict it are to be commended for their honesty. Their detractors, it follows, are to be chided for squeamishness and hypocrisy. This is certainly Mr. Noé's line of defense: He has taken it upon himself to strip the scales from our eyes and rub our faces in the vile degradation from which we would otherwise turn away.</p>
        <p>Without giving ''Irréversible'' more credit than it deserves, we can acknowledge, in theory, that an acquaintance, through sounds and images, with some of the world's physical horrors might be a salutary thing. But some sticky moral problems persist. What if, in spite of the director's intentions, the audience takes a voyeuristic pleasure in what it is looking at? Presumably, we would not react the same way outside of the movie theater. But then, too, the scale and impact of screen violence is far different from its real-world counterpart. Renata Adler, during her 14 months as chief film critic for The New York Times, noted that screen violence inverts our usual ways of measuring horror.</p>
        <p>''In real life,'' she wrote, ''or in ethics seminars, one person dying slowly is less monstrous than a hundred blowing sky high. Not so, I believe, on film, for none of the deaths was real, and only one was made cruel and personal.''</p>
        <p>Any number of war movies and action pictures will bear this out. The scenes viewers tell themselves they cannot bear to watch tend to be those, as in ''Irréversible,'' in which the brutality is intimate, particular and sustained. Now that the blown-up masses are often computer-generated, large-scale on-screen death has lost even more of its impact.</p>
        <p>All this poses a challenge for filmmakers interested in confronting what is, after all, one of the enormous facts of modern history: the expansion and refinement of the technologies of wholesale slaughter. How can you -- or, to put it in ethical terms, how should you -- use the power of cinema to convey the experience of political violence, of genocide or mechanized warfare? As it happens, two movies nominated for best picture in tonight's Academy Awards try to face this challenge. Both come from directors who have long been drawn to the vicissitudes of violence -- its motivating forces, its effects, its fascinating rhythms.</p>
        <p>Martin Scorsese's first film, ''Who's That Knocking at My Door'' (1968), begins with a series of street fights, which seem to break out like tap-dance routines in a musical. His latest, ''Gangs of New York,'' set in the same Lower Manhattan streets a century earlier, raises street mayhem to the level of opera. Most of the picture takes place in a pre-Civil War city governed by tribal codes, in which combat is an ancient ritual. Mr. Scorsese's subject is the way this archaic mode of violence is swept away: The gangs are transformed into lynch mobs, and then overpowered by lines of uniformed soldiers marching through the streets. What you feel, in the chaotic, relentless climax, is the onslaught of modernity, as bloodshed evolves from an artisanal to an industrial activity and Mr. Scorsese, for the first time, attempts a war movie.</p>
        <p>''The Pianist,'' by Mr. Polanski, is in some sense a war movie, but one whose restraint stands in contrast to the extravagance of ''Gangs.'' Mr. Polanski's subject, the Holocaust, still seems to defy all representation. Its horror is so total as to exist beyond the reach of imagination, only to be diminished by attempts to bring it to life. So Mr. Polanski chooses instead to suggest the scope of Nazi cruelty by zeroing in on its particular effects.</p>
        <p>The violence in the film is not just particular, but random. Workers in the Warsaw ghetto are selected for execution for no clear reason; an old man in a wheelchair is thrown from his apartment window.</p>
        <p>The survival of the protagonist comes to seem equally random, and the pianist himself, played by Adrien Brody in the year's single best screen performance, is not just a being whose physical existence is in peril, but an individual consciousness terrified of being snuffed out. The audience's dread at witnessing something horrible combines with a more elemental fear, of its own nonexistence. And this interior state of feeling, more than any spectacle of cruelty, brings an unimaginable experience home.</p>
