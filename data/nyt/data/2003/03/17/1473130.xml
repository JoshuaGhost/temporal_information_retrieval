        <p>At the White House, the sound of a possible war has turned out to be the sound of silence.</p>

        <p>At the White House, the sound of a possible war has turned out to be the sound of silence.</p>
        <p>President Bush may have spent last week making phone calls, and yesterday jetting across the Atlantic and back for an emergency summit with the leaders of Britain and Spain, but otherwise his household has settled into an eerie calm. Mr. Bush and his wife, the world's most powerful couple, have spent the last two weeks virtually housebound, with travel plans postponed and most dinners at home, either alone or with small groups of friends from Texas.</p>
        <p>Laura Bush has nothing on her public or personal schedule for the coming week, when a war might well start. Her press secretary, Noelia Rodriguez, says that Mrs. Bush, in fact, has nothing on her schedule until much later in the spring -- a signal, perhaps, of when the White House expects a war in Iraq to be over. Until then, Ms. Rodriguez said, ''we're moving forward on planning, so when the opportunity comes we'll be ready to move.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the Bushes are well-known homebodies who have deliberately not made a social splash in Washington. But their life inside the bubble of the White House has seemed more isolated as both have stopped almost all travel outside the Beltway. Mrs. Bush did slip away yesterday to see her twin daughters and an old friend in Austin, Tex., while the president was at the summit in the Azores, but she is expected back in Washington by Monday afternoon.</p>
        <p>To liven things, a half-dozen friends from Texas came to stay with Mrs. Bush for two days at the White House two weeks ago. The women went with her to the National Gallery; George Washington's estate, Mount Vernon; and lunch in Alexandria, Va. Mrs. Bush also went out recently with her husband to the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington, a gala at Ford's Theater and a rare evening at the home of Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser.</p>
        <p>But so far no plans are on the schedule, not even for a trip to the Bush ranch in Texas. The weekend before last, when the Bushes stayed in town for the Gridiron dinner and skipped their usual Saturday and Sunday at the Camp David presidential retreat, the first lady showed signs of cabin fever.</p>
        <p>''I saw her at the Gridiron and asked her if she had gotten the chance to get out and walk,'' an administration official recalled. ''And she said, 'Well, a little bit on the South Lawn.' She sounded liked a caged bird.''</p>
        <p>Other things at the White House are in a waiting pattern, too, most noticeably the 2004 re-election campaign. Late last month, Teel Bivins, a Texas state senator and old friend of the president, went quail hunting in Texas with Mr. Rove, and asked the question on every Republican's mind.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'When's the re-elect going to start?' '' Mr. Bivins said. ''And he said, 'We've got a war to win first.' ''</p>
        <p>Brad Freeman, a major fund-raiser for the president, agreed with that assessment.</p>
        <p>''Everything's on hold,'' he said, adding that there had not yet been a meeting about raising the hundreds of millions of dollars that the White House says it needs for the 2004 campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's main domestic policies -- an overhaul of Medicare and billions of dollars in tax cuts -- are also effectively postponed, waiting for the president to get back on Air Force One to peddle them, after Iraq.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Bush household does what it can. The first lady is taking care of the arrangements for the White House 2003 Christmas card. She also spoke recently at a fund-raiser to fight breast cancer and had coffee with the first lady of Rwanda, and she still sees her personal trainer at the White House two or three days a week.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Bush is adamantly not giving interviews about the president's state of mind, or hers.</p>
        <p>''She'd rather focus her attention internally on what's going on here at the White House right now,'' Ms. Rodriguez said.</p>
        <p>But the current reading material of the couple offers some clues. Mrs. Bush is reading ''Austerlitz'' by W. G. Sebald, a novel that won a National Book Critics Circle award. It is about an architectural historian who learns that his parents sent him as a child to Britain from Central Europe to escape the Nazis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush is reading two books: ''The Confessor'' by Daniel Silva, a best-selling spy thriller about a Mossad agent and a new pope, and ''The Conquerors'' by Michael Beschloss, about the reconstruction of a war-ravaged aggressor nation, Germany, after World War II.</p>
