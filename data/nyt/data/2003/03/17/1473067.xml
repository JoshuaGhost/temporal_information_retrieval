        <p>The French composer Tristan Murail is best known for chamber and orchestral works in which the conventions of structure are less important than the exploration of sound, color and perceived time.

        <p>Mr. Murail has also undertaken these explorations in a half-dozen piano works, composed between 1967 and this year.

        <p>The French composer Tristan Murail is best known for chamber and orchestral works in which the conventions of structure are less important than the exploration of sound, color and perceived time. Often these focuses are interrelated: as Mr. Murail and his interpreters examine the nuances of a particular tone or timbre, time can seem to expand or contract, depending on how interesting the musical object at hand is.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murail has also undertaken these explorations in a half-dozen piano works, composed between 1967 and this year. In an installment of the Composer Portraits series at Miller Theater on Tuesday evening -- and as part of the Sounds French series also in New York this month -- the pianist Marilyn Nonken played them all.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nonken is a reliable and persuasive new-music pianist. But even in hands as capable as hers, Mr. Murail's ideas about how to put the piano's palette to use in his compositional quest were surprisingly constricted.</p>
        <p>The earliest piece here is ''Comme un Oeil Suspendu et Poli Par le Songe . . . ,'' an audition piece from 1967 that won Mr. Murail a place in Messiaen's composition class. It uses delicate figuration high in the piano's range to create a fluid, dreamlike atmosphere, and in some ways it was the most vital of the six works.</p>
        <p>Its successor, ''Estuaire'' (1972), unfolds more forcefully and uses more than a hint of Ravelian figuration to evoke the water imagery suggested in its title. But thereafter Mr. Murail appears to have lost the thread. ''Territoires de l'Oubli'' (1977) magnified the gestures of the two earlier works, alternately splashing about at length near the top of the keyboard and unleashing thundering chords in the style of Frederic Rzewski lower down. Here, though, the scope of the work is much larger than that of the two earlier pieces, and without a guiding sense of structure it quickly came to sound diffuse and also endless.</p>
        <p>The recent works on the second half of the program were more of the same; in fact, ''Les Travaux et les Jours'' (2003), which was written for Ms. Nonken, was much, much more of the same. Its pages of tinkly treble figures and repetitive chordal dialogues unfolded relentlessly, and the more a listener sought something to hang onto -- the suppleness of Ms. Nonken's phrasing, or the occasional, fleeting bit of unusual harmonic flotsam -- the more oppressive the music became. It wasn't that it was difficult, or complex or even abrasive. It was just brutally dull.</p>
