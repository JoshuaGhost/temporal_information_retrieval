        <p>She has made 17 albums, including one that sold a million copies. Her songs have been recorded by Vanilla Fudge, Bette Midler and Cher, among others. Yet when Janis Ian went to East Orange High School, she was kicked out of the chorus. ''They said my voice wasn't good enough,'' she said. ''It's a good thing I didn't listen.'' Ms. Ian, a Grammy-winning singer and composer, returns to the Garden State to perform at Appel Farm Arts and Music Center in Elmer on Friday at 8 p.m. and at Madison High School in Madison on Saturday at 8 p.m. For information about the Appel Farm performance, call (800)394-1211; for Madison High School, call (908)771-0187.</p>

        <p>Tired of Getting Lost?</p>
        <p>How can you find Morristown? On the map it is N.40.8 degrees, latitude,W.74.5 longitude -- information that tells you where to go, but not how. That's the theme of ''Navigation: Finding Your Way,'' at the Morris Museum in Morristown through June 22. The exhibition, from the Exploratorium in San Francisco, has 17 interactive stations showing how people use their senses, tools and maps to navigate. There is a gizmo that allows visitors to map their faces, a maze and a sextant showing how to navigate by the stars.</p>
        <p>But the stars in the exhibit are James Dean, Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein. The sextant measures the angular distance between two people by optically placing the image of someone's head onto the body of another. In other words, visitors can see themselves with Albert Einstein's head or Marilyn Monroe's body.</p>
        <p>Information: (973)971-3700.</p>
        <p>Photos for a Cause</p>
        <p>The actress Ellen Burstyn takes photographs on her travels and from her backyard by the Hudson in Rockland County, at dawn, sunset and nighttime ''when the moon spills on to the river,'' she said. Her work is on display, through March 30, at the Belskie Museum of Art and Science in Closter. The photos are and is being sold to benefit Share, the Society for Hospital and Resource Exchange, which was founded by Dr. Martha MacGuffie, Ms. Burstyn's neighbor. In 1998, Dr. MacGuffie's work with the group, which assists medically underserved communities in Kenya, was honored by the International Lions Club; she received the Lions' Humanitarian Award, which has also been given to Danny Kaye, Jimmy Carter and Mother Teresa.</p>
        <p>Call (201)768-0286 for information on the show, which is closed to the public today for a members' reception.</p>
        <p>A Massacre Remembered</p>
        <p>At 5 a.m. on March 21, 1778 , Major John Graves Simcoe and 300 British troops attacked the home of Judge William Hancock in Hancock's Bridge and bayoneted the judge, killing him and nine Continentals who were asleep in the house. The attack, which came to be known as the Hancock House Massacre, will be remembered on Saturday at the state historic site in Salem County administered with the help of a private group, the Friends of the Hancock House. There will be a recreation of battles and 18th-century camp life, said Doris Tice, a trustee for the Friends of the Hancock House, who is married to a descendant of the slain judge. Re-enacting the massacre would not be appropriate, she said. (856)935-4373.</p>
        <p>Small Textiles, Big Moment</p>
        <p>When Joanie San Chirico, a fiber artist from Tom's River, joined the Ocean County Artists' Guild five years ago, she wanted to exhibit a quilt she had made. ''They made me frame it because they didn't consider it fine art,'' she recalled.</p>
        <p>But the Guild in Island Heights has since had a change of heart, allowing Ms. San Chirico and another member, Jane Lindenmayer, a textile artist from Mantoloking, to organize an exhibit called ''Miniature Textiles Invitational.'' On view through April 1, the show includes 37 works no bigger than a foot square made by artists from the Netherlands, England, Canada, Belgium, Australia and New Jersey. ''It's somewhat of a departure, and we want more of it,'' said Gene Kronberg, president of the Guild.'' Taking note of fiber art's enhanced status, Ms. San Chirico said, ''Galleries and museums are starting to recognize it as legitimate art and not just women's work.'' (732)270-3111.</p>
