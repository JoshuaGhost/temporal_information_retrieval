        <p>In a sermon excerpted here and dated Jan. 14, 1776, the Rev. John Rodgers, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of New York, issued a call to arms:</p>
        <p>Let me desire you to look round and consider the alarming state our country is in and what need you will have of an interest in your favor of God, to go through the trying scenes that may be before you. We are involved in the calamities of a civil war and what will be the issue and [illegible] this unhappy struggle, God only knows. Our countrymen have already been called to bleed in her cause and sacrifice their lives in her service, and how much more blood must be shed before the contest is at an end is to us unknown.</p>

        <p>In a sermon excerpted here and dated Jan. 14, 1776, the Rev. John Rodgers, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of New York, issued a call to arms:</p>
        <p>Let me desire you to look round and consider the alarming state our country is in and what need you will have of an interest in your favor of God, to go through the trying scenes that may be before you. We are involved in the calamities of a civil war and what will be the issue and [illegible] this unhappy struggle, God only knows. Our countrymen have already been called to bleed in her cause and sacrifice their lives in her service, and how much more blood must be shed before the contest is at an end is to us unknown.</p>
        <p>Our ancestors, animated with an heroic spirit, encountered adversity and danger to have this land, our happy asylum, their posterity.</p>
        <p>Our rights are now invaded and your country's cause now looks up to her free-born sons for guardianship and protection. Many have already dressed themselves in military array and taken the field, choosing rather to risk their lives in the cause of liberty, than to resign their privilege and live in slavery. Still there is call for more to engage in the cause and there risk themselves for action against any enemy.</p>
        <p>Let a spirit of patriotism fire your breath and engage you, to put on the honor for your country and the cities of our God. Let a spirit of incurring cowardice be banished from your boosome, and let the love of your country, your privilege, your temporal, all animate you to distinguish yourselves for the good of this land.</p>
        <p>When you are invited voluntarily to enlist in service, as you will be on the ensuing day, show that you have the spirit of Englishmen and are ready to take the field and jeopard your lives for your inestimable privileges. And while you are learning the military act, and preparing for the field, prepare for the day of death. The present season may be the only one you ever will have therefore.</p>
