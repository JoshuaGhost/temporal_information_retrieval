        <p>MAYBE you have it differently, but the supporting players in my life -- they all think they have the lead roles.

        <p>MAYBE you have it differently, but the supporting players in my life -- they all think they have the lead roles. And sometimes, at the end of a long day (or call it a performance -- our show has run forever), someone will say something like, ''That moment, where you paused a second longer than usual . . . ''</p>
        <p>''Oh, yes?'' you say, hungry to be appreciated.</p>
        <p>''Pretty cool,'' says your child, before he consents to go to bed (where, of course, we are all stars -- that's what dreaming is for).</p>
        <p>What I'm trying to suggest is that most of us see ourselves as the center of the world, if not quite yet the hub of popular attention. In ''The Hours,'' for instance, I am very fond of everything Miranda Richardson does as Vanessa Bell, the talented sister of Virginia Woolf -- putting a brave, fond face on living beside someone who is simply more vivid, more central, more needy. Ms. Richardson is a great actress -- look at her performance in the new David Cronenberg picture, ''Spider'' -- and it's not inconceivable that she could have played Virginia and been desperately moving. But she would not quite have been a star, as Nicole Kidman is in the role.</p>
        <p>Anyway, I read that there are 33 minutes of Julianne Moore in ''The Hours'' and only about 30 of Ms. Kidman. Yet Ms. Moore is nominated as a supporting actress while Ms. Kidman, a nose behind, is the lead. It does remind me of a family. Sometimes a life in support -- or, for actors like Ms. Richardson, a career in Britain -- can breed a lovely, profound modesty. It's a thing not often seen in actors but so supportive in life.</p>
        <p>When is an actress in support? When she's supporting the play, the picture, the show, the theater, the community of acting? Well, that's just the kind of brassy team rhetoric we may hear when the awards are handed out on March 23. But you may also detect that night the shameless, childish self-dramatization that marks the opening of Bette Davis's 1960 memoir, ''The Lonely Life'': ''I have always been driven by some distant music -- a battle hymn no doubt -- for I have been at war from the beginning. I rode into the field with sword gleaming and standard flying. I was going to conquer the world.''</p>
        <p>Was she thinking of the Oscar battle she waged after she made ''Of Human Bondage,'' in 1934? The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was young then, but it was having increasing troubles with the labor problems that hit Hollywood in the early 1930's. The academy was regarded -- with justice -- as a company union, as window dressing, as the natural enemy of everyone who did the detail work on pictures. The Screen Actors Guild had been formed in 1933 as an alternative, and it had instructed its members to resign from the academy. Thus there were fewer than 100 actors left to make the nominations for 1934. They proposed three candidates (the custom then): Claudette Colbert in ''It Happened One Night,'' Grace Moore in ''One Night of Love'' and Norma Shearer in ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street.''</p>
        <p>Whereupon that world Davis was planning to conquer discovered itself outraged. For where was the actress who, by many standards, had given a brilliant and unexpected performance (still worth seeing) as Mildred, the vicious, vulgar waitress who humiliates Leslie Howard's medical student in ''Of Human Bondage''? Not that everyone liked the performance. Davis's bosses at Warner Brothers hated the project when RKO sought Davis for the role. They said it was poison. She replied that it required real acting. ''Go hang yourself, then'' is more or less what Jack Warner said.</p>
        <p>She went with RKO, on loan-out. In years to come, Davis and Warner Brothers would end in the London courts, fighting the fight of business versus art. For the moment, however, Warner Brothers did nothing to back ''Of Human Bondage'' for the Oscars. In those days, all it would have taken was instructing Warner employees to vote for it.</p>
        <p>Coupled with the actors' revolt, ''Bondage'' became a very big issue. As a gesture to Davis, the academy decreed that voters could write in names other than those nominated. She was the press favorite. But the Warner blockade held, and although Davis attended the ceremony that year, Claudette Colbert won. (Colbert had so little hope of winning that she was actually on her way out of town when her name was announced.)</p>
        <p>SUCH things couldn't go on: the academy agreed to regularize the process of nomination and voting. It agreed to five nominees. And in a blatant effort to lure actors back to the academy, it proposed introducing the category of ''supporting'' actor and actress. That system began in 1936, and we have it still today, changed only a little: now, actors must choose whether they want a given performance to be considered as a lead or as support, and it cannot be nominated in both categories. (Barry Fitzgerald was nominated in both for the 1944 film ''Going My Way.'' He won for supporting, and the rules were changed.) Gradually, the academy and the unions learned to live together -- and Bette Davis got seven best-actress nominations from 1935 to 1945 (and she won for ''Dangerous'' and ''Jezebel'').</p>
        <p>We may doubt that many actors went to school resolved to be supporting players, though it's more common for people looking like Charles Laughton or Thelma Ritter to see themselves as potential ''character'' players rather than romantic leads. We take it for granted nowadays that a performer (and the company behind him or her) decides on a category with thoughts of winning. And history has its outstanding examples: Patricia Neal in ''Hud'' and Louise Fletcher in ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' looked to most everyone like supporting actors -- but they took the big prize.</p>
        <p>It's far harder, of course, to find a lead-role player winning as a supporting player. (Tatum O'Neal won as supporting actress for ''Paper Moon,'' but any kid knows she's the lead in that picture.) In part, I think that's because the Hollywood community, like the rest of us, is sentimental about supporting players. We know they're not as well paid, and often not as pretty. Yet all of us, growing up with the movies, have our favorites: Walter Brennan, Mercedes McCambridge, Joe Pesci, Dianne Wiest -- you name them.</p>
        <p>But now let history step aside. Whether or not you like ''The Hours'' (and I detect very split opinions), it is valuable as a story that asserts the absence of central, dominating characters in life. What ''The Hours'' is really saying is that any of the actresses might have taken any of the parts -- that ego is less important than the pattern of repetition and being on the same team. It's true that Virginia Woolf starts the chain that provides the structure of the film, by writing the novel that will inspire or warn readers she can never meet. To that extent, ''The Hours,'' as a book or as a movie, is a profound tribute to the efficacy of art and the infinite community of souls.</p>
        <p>I know, that is not quite Hollywood language -- not when we are so accustomed to the blaring ambitions and the ability to dominate a frame that helped Miss Davis be Bette. But there are great films about groups of people -- small or large -- in which we can see how every individual reckons himself or herself the center of the universe. Still, the point of view of the work insists on seeing kinship, relativity, interaction and interdependence -- even a crowd so large that private faces are no longer detectable.</p>
        <p>Foreign films? Yes. Like the four characters who make up the story of Kenji Mizoguchi's ''Ugetsu Monogatari.'' In Jean Renoir's account of a shooting party at a French chateau, ''The Rules of the Game,'' there are close to a dozen characters all on the same level. Marcel Dalio's marquis may be a notch above the others: he is the host, we learn more about his interests, he is more pivotal in the plot. And he has some of the best lines. But a year or two later, Dalio was a refugee in Hollywood doing little bits -- the croupier at Rick's Cafe in ''Casablanca,'' Frenchy in ''To Have and Have Not.''</p>
        <p>There have been American directors who preferred to have a crowded scene, who liked supporting actors or saw character in actresses: Ernst Lubitsch, Otto Preminger, John Ford, Howard Hawks. More recently, I'd point to Robert Altman (whose ''Nashville'' has more than 20 characters of the same weight) and Paul Thomas Anderson -- directors for whom that odd word ''ensemble'' is sometimes invoked. Most great acting companies, from the Moscow Art Theater to the Group Theater to the Royal Dramatic in Stockholm to the Royal Shakespeare Company in London, have aspired to that term and have encouraged the notion that in a single repertory season, say, an actor might play a couple of lead parts and a couple far smaller.</p>
        <p>But that rigging can seem artificial. Today's unknown, an understudy, can be a star next week if someone really breaks a leg. But don't expect him to stay an ensemble fellow. There's room for both: actors who specialize in the resplendent portrait, actors who blend into the group scene. And this above all, I hope: that today's successful actors cherish their good fortune, and know how far casting's chance and our whimsical taste may be all that distinguish a movie star from someone who quite simply and quietly never let 97 films down -- and whose name is on the tip of your tongue.</p>
