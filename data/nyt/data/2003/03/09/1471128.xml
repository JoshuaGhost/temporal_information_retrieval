        <p>First it was Helene Eksterowicz, the elementary school psychologist from Haddonfield who won, and then was jilted by ''The Bachelor.'' Then came ''Joe Millionaire's'' pick, Zora Andrich, the substitute teacher from Lambertville, who at least got $500,000 for her troubles.</p>
        <p>Just last week it was ''The Family,'' yet another reality television show. And you guessed it -- their roots are in New Jersey, Manalapan, to be precise.</p>

        <p>First it was Helene Eksterowicz, the elementary school psychologist from Haddonfield who won, and then was jilted by ''The Bachelor.'' Then came ''Joe Millionaire's'' pick, Zora Andrich, the substitute teacher from Lambertville, who at least got $500,000 for her troubles.</p>
        <p>Just last week it was ''The Family,'' yet another reality television show. And you guessed it -- their roots are in New Jersey, Manalapan, to be precise.</p>
        <p>Time for a primal scream: WHY NEW JERSEY?</p>
        <p>''I think it's just a matter of convenience,'' said William Lutz, a professor of English at Rutgers-Camden, who is most well-known for his book ''Doublespeak.'' ''After all, what is the hallmark of reality programming: cheapness.''</p>
        <p>Embellishing his explanation, Mr. Lutz went on: ''It's lots better than paying those turkeys on 'Friends' a million bucks an episode and even better than finding someone in Boise. New Jersey is convenient to New York, and that's what's attractive for these shows.''</p>
        <p>The real guessing game, Mr. Lutz said, is what happens when the networks decide that even this kind of programming is too expensive.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it will be back to test patterns,'' he said. ''That will be even cheaper than paying the bridge tolls to New Jersey.''</p>
