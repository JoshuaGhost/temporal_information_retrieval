        <p>Editorial urges Pres Vladimir Putin to halt Russia's arms sales to Iraq, which violate UN sanctions; notes that Russia has weapons that pose lethal threat to US and British soldiers</p>

        <p>Whatever one may think of Russia's political opposition to the war in Iraq, no one denies Moscow's right to it. Supplying arms to Iraq is something else. Not only is this a clear violation of U.N. sanctions, but Russia has weapons that pose a lethal threat to U.S. and British soldiers. Those are exactly the kinds of weapons that the Bush administration has accused Russia -- and now Syria -- of supplying Iraq. Whether President Vladimir Putin chooses to acknowledge the sales or not, he would be well advised to make sure they are stopped right now.</p>
        <p>U.S. officials say they have been pressuring Russia for many months now to end sales of three types of equipment: night vision goggles, antitank missiles and equipment that can jam global positioning systems, used to guide ''smart'' weapons. The ability to fight at night is one of the coalition's strengths; the Russian missiles can knock out the mighty Abrams tank, and smart weapons can be sent astray with the jamming device. These things may have already been used to deadly purpose.</p>

        <p>Whatever one may think of Russia's political opposition to the war in Iraq, no one denies Moscow's right to it. Supplying arms to Iraq is something else. Not only is this a clear violation of U.N. sanctions, but Russia has weapons that pose a lethal threat to U.S. and British soldiers. Those are exactly the kinds of weapons that the Bush administration has accused Russia -- and now Syria -- of supplying Iraq. Whether President Vladimir Putin chooses to acknowledge the sales or not, he would be well advised to make sure they are stopped right now.</p>
        <p>U.S. officials say they have been pressuring Russia for many months now to end sales of three types of equipment: night vision goggles, antitank missiles and equipment that can jam global positioning systems, used to guide ''smart'' weapons. The ability to fight at night is one of the coalition's strengths; the Russian missiles can knock out the mighty Abrams tank, and smart weapons can be sent astray with the jamming device. These things may have already been used to deadly purpose.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld also said Syria was shipping such equipment into Iraq, although the Pentagon says it does not know if that, too, is Russian in origin.</p>
        <p>The Russian government and the firms that manufacture this equipment have denied providing any of it to Iraq. But the White House has been quite specific in its allegations, and even the Russian press has suggested that the charges are not without substance. Perhaps the Kremlin is technically correct, and the arms are being smuggled out by old-guard military officers or impoverished military enterprises, or they are reaching Iraq through intermediaries and third countries. These are sadly familiar routes for arms sales by former Soviet states and satellites.</p>
        <p>It is also possible that Mr. Putin has legitimate grievances against Washington. He made sincere efforts to forge a partnership with President Bush, including extensive support in the war on terrorism, but ended up swallowing some tough political pills with little to show for it. So Mr. Putin may have decided to draw the line on Iraq. Russia has substantial interests in Iraq, including a huge unpaid debt for past arms sales and lost contracts in Iraqi oil fields. If Moscow had been promised some way to recoup, Mr. Putin may not have thrown in his lot so ardently with France and Germany.</p>
        <p>None of that, however, justifies providing Iraqis with means of killing Americans. This goes beyond political calculation, and beyond pique. Mr. Putin must understand that if Russian arms are reaching Iraq by any route, and are putting American men and women in harm's way, it is simply not enough to declare that he is not responsible, or to pretend it is not happening. Many Americans may share the Russian objections to this war, but no Americans will tolerate or forgive having an American tank blown up by a Russian missile.</p>
