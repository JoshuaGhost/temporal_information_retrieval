        <p>The police closed a Times Square arcade last night where 10 people were injured, one critically, in a melee earlier this month.</p>
        <p>The Broadway City Arcade on 42nd Street was closed at 8 p.m., with police citing nine violent incidents that had occurred there recently. The arcade, which includes a nightclub, had six violations involving underage patrons, the police said.</p>
        <p>Officers from the Midtown South Precinct and the Civil Enforcement Unit had been investigating the arcade, recording numerous felony arrests there since January 2002 for assaults, drugs and weapons violations, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police closed the arcade after a nuisance abatement order was issued yesterday based on violations for underage drinking and violence.</p>
        <p>On March 9, eight people were shot and two were stabbed at the arcade, which is between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</p>
        <p>In that incident, shots were fired about 2:45 a.m. in a second-floor nightclub at the arcade, sending people stampeding toward the exits.</p>
        <p>The police recovered four knives and two box cutters at the arcade. The victims ranged in age from 17 to 25.</p>
