        <p>Officials of a construction company that did work for the city pleaded guilty yesterday to falsely claiming that the company had paid its workers the prevailing wages city contractors are required to pay, the city Department of Investigation said. The department said that from 1999 to 2001, while replacing underground storage tanks for the city Housing Authority, the company, State Environmental Services of Brooklyn, claimed that it had paid its laborers at least $38 an hour and its plumbers at least $42 an hour, including benefits. In fact, the city said, the company was paying the employees $11 to $15 an hour with no benefits. The company agreed to pay $275,000 in restitution, most of which will go to the workers, the city said.</p>
