        <p>A schoolteacher once considered for a police oversight board has been arrested and accused of trying to sell cocaine to an undercover police officer, a police spokeswoman said yesterday. The suspect, Orlando Hernandez, 33, teaches mathematics at Fair Haven Middle School. He was arrested on Friday and released the same day on $150,000 bond. He has been suspended from his job with pay, pending the outcome of his trial, a school spokeswoman said. Mr. Hernandez was discussed as a possible nominee in 2001 for the Police Department's Civilian Review Board, a spokesman for Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said.</p>
