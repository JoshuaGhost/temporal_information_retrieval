        <p>Re ''Tax-Cut Plan May Endanger New Housing'' (news article, March 19):</p>
        <p>As the developer of the first project in New York City to use low-income housing tax credits, our organization has relied heavily on this financing tool to build more than 500 units of affordable housing in Lower Manhattan. The effect of the president's proposed tax plan appears to cut against his stated philosophy: to replace government dollars with private investment, when possible.</p>
        <p>Our most recent project in the Lower East Side, 52 units of affordable housing for low-income families and senior citizens, attracted more than 10,000 applications, and would probably not have been built without the financing generated by low-income housing tax credits.</p>
        <p>The loss of this vital source of investment will dramatically affect the city's efforts to address the crisis in affordable housing.</p>
