        <p>Philip A. Giordano's decision to testify in his own defense appeared to backfire today when he admitted that federal agents had told him they were investigating whether he accepted bribes while he was mayor of Waterbury.</p>
        <p>Until today, Mr. Giordano's federal trial focused solely on 18 charges that he had sexually abused two young girls. His lawyer, Andrew B. Bowman, had taken pains to prevent the government from mentioning its long corruption investigation of the former mayor.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giordano, who testified on Thursday that he had received oral sex from a prostitute while her daughter and niece were within sight in a separate room, opened himself to those questions today when the prosecutor asked him whether he had been told at his arrest in 2001 that there was evidence linking him to sex crimes involving children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano, 39, who has denied ever touching the girls, said federal agents had told him they were interested only in municipal corruption, not sexual abuse.</p>
        <p>That statement, to his lawyer's dismay, allowed the prosecutor, Peter S. Jongbloed, to open a new line of inquiry, into corruption. Under questioning, Mr. Giordano admitted he took cash payments from a local contractor seeking city business.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowman, the defense lawyer, tried several times to halt the bribery-related questions, but Judge Alan H. Nevas repeatedly overruled him, and even turned to Mr. Giordano at one point to explain why he allowed such questions to continue.</p>
        <p>''The more you talk, the more you volunteer, the longer this examination is going to go on,'' Judge Nevas said. ''You just keep opening up new areas.''</p>
        <p>From there, Mr. Giordano acknowledged that he had taken cash from a local contractor, whom he identified only as Joe, who sought a city sewer contract. The contractor also gave him expensive suits and shoes, Mr. Giordano said, and agreed to pay off a $25,000 debt left over from his 2000 campaign for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giordano said he had not reported the money or clothing to the Internal Revenue Service because he had considered them gifts, and regardless, he added, he had not treated the contractor any differently because of them.</p>
        <p>Closing arguments in the trial are expected on Monday in Federal District Court here. Testimony concluded today with jurors hearing from a Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent and an I.R.S. official who interviewed Mr. Giordano when he was arrested in July 2001.</p>
        <p>The I.R.S. agent, Joseph M. McTague, testified that at a meeting moments after F.B.I. agents arrested Mr. Giordano, he heard the former mayor tacitly admit having sex with the two girls, who were 8 and 10 years old at the time.</p>
        <p>''When confronted with the statement that we had information about sexual relations with minors, he said, 'Does that have to come out?' '' Mr. McTague told jurors. ''He said, 'Can't that just go away?' ''</p>
        <p>''He felt that it would be very difficult to explain those charges to his wife,'' Mr. McTague went on, adding that Mr. Giordano even asked federal agents for help in explaining the charges to her.</p>
        <p>This week, the two girls testified that they performed oral sex on the mayor on several occasions in his private law offices. But today, Mr. Giordano, appearing shades paler and more fatigued than he ever did during his time as mayor or as a Senate candidate, again told jurors that he had never touched the girls.</p>
        <p>''I did not do anything criminal,'' Mr. Giordano said, after admitting under cross-examination that while he was mayor, he carried on at least 10 sexual relationships with women other than his wife, Dawn, who listened stoically from the visitors' gallery. ''The only jurisdiction for what I have done is my wife and my God.''</p>
