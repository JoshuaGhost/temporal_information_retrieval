        <p>Directed by Hideo Nakata  In Japanese, with English subtitles  Not rated, 104 minutes</p>
        <p>With the Japanese writer and director Hideo Nakata, Hollywood seems to have found the biggest mother lode of remake material since the French filmmaker Francis Veber (who wrote ''La Cage aux Folles'' and ''My Father the Hero'') was mined out a few years ago. Mr. Nakata's ''Ring,'' a creepy supernatural thriller about a videotape that kills, was profitably remade by DreamWorks last year; now, his 1999 ''Chaos'' is being released in the United States just as that film, too, is being remade, this time by Jonathan Glazer (''Sexy Beast'') with Robert De Niro and Benicio Del Toro in the leads. (Mr. Nakata's newest feature, last year's ''Dark Water,'' is apparently still up for grabs.)</p>

        <p>This noirish romance has none of little of the pervasive eeriness that made Hideo Nakata's "Ring" one of Asia's biggest hits.</p>

        <p>Directed by Hideo Nakata  In Japanese, with English subtitles  Not rated, 104 minutes</p>
        <p>With the Japanese writer and director Hideo Nakata, Hollywood seems to have found the biggest mother lode of remake material since the French filmmaker Francis Veber (who wrote ''La Cage aux Folles'' and ''My Father the Hero'') was mined out a few years ago. Mr. Nakata's ''Ring,'' a creepy supernatural thriller about a videotape that kills, was profitably remade by DreamWorks last year; now, his 1999 ''Chaos'' is being released in the United States just as that film, too, is being remade, this time by Jonathan Glazer (''Sexy Beast'') with Robert De Niro and Benicio Del Toro in the leads. (Mr. Nakata's newest feature, last year's ''Dark Water,'' is apparently still up for grabs.)</p>
        <p>''Chaos,'' which opens today in Manhattan, has little of the pervasive eeriness that made ''Ring'' one of Asia's biggest hits, and no supernatural elements. Instead, it's a clear pastiche of the sort of ''I'm bad, you're bad, we deserve each other'' noirish romance that James M. Cain forever defined with ''The Postman Always Rings Twice.''</p>
        <p>The setting is modern-day Tokyo, photographed in an airy, sunlit manner that makes that dense, twisting city look more like Los Angeles than itself. A scowling executive (Ken Mitsuishi) is lunching with his elegant wife (Miki Nakatani) at a fashionable French restaurant. When the time comes to pay, the wife steps outside while the husband handles the credit card transaction. But when he goes out to meet her, she has vanished into the bright, bland Tokyo afternoon.</p>
        <p>The telephone call comes quickly: the voice of a young man (Masato Hagiwara) informs the executive that his wife is a prisoner and will be killed unless a certain sum is delivered to a certain place. This being relatively early in the running time of ''Chaos,'' we can be sure that nothing is what it seems to be, and soon enough Mr. Nakata is unleashing a series of baroque double- and triple-crosses that make ''The Postman Always Rings Twice'' look like ''Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day.''</p>
        <p>As always, Mr. Nakata's plotting is clever and effective, but the film lacks the emotional core that made the suspense of ''Ring'' and ''Dark Water'' meaningful. Like M. Night Shyamalan (''The Sixth Sense''), Mr. Nakata usually cloaks his artificial plot developments within a vividly real context of failed communication between adults and children, a topic lacking in the unaccountably child-free ''Chaos.'' The film's mechanical workings are still impressive, but between the unsympathetic characters and the coldly precise direction, there is little here for an audience to clutch to its heart.</p>
