        <p>The Nets considered one loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers an inexcusable aberration. After two losses, however, it has turned into a sickening pattern.</p>
        <p>The Nets sprinted to an 11-2 lead against Cleveland, the worst team in the league, but the Cavaliers, led by the All-Star center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, outplayed the Nets in the final three quarters for a 93-88 victory at Gund Arena.</p>
        <p>The Nets tied the score at 85-85 with 4 minutes 1 second to play, but they did not make another field goal. The Cavaliers, who trailed by as many as 13 points in the first quarter, won only their 13th game of the season.</p>
        <p>Which team is going to the playoffs and which one is going to the lottery? The Nets seem to switch personalities game by game.</p>
        <p>''I'm a little worried about that,'' Nets Coach Byron Scott said. ''When you get to the postseason, you can't be up and down like this. If you don't have any consistency in the postseason, you'll be out in the first round.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday night at home, the Nets avenged a February loss to the lowly Grizzlies, but the Nets failed to exact revenge for their 93-90 loss to the Cavaliers on Feb. 25. Cleveland had lost 10 of 11 before tonight.</p>
        <p>''This is a tough one to swallow,'' Nets guard Lucious Harris said.</p>
        <p>With the Pistons and the 76ers winning today, the Nets dropped two and a half games behind Detroit for the Eastern Conference lead; they are only a half-game ahead of Philadelphia for the Atlantic Division lead. The Nets (42-28) have won only 8 of the 21 games they have played since the All-Star Game break. They have 12 games remaining in the regular season.</p>
        <p>Not even the players know which team will show up. ''That's the way we are right now, at this point in the season, we're like a roller coaster,'' Harris said. ''We're up high and sometimes we're at our lowest.''</p>
        <p>Tonight the Nets compounded their errors by playing porous defense. They allowed the Cavaliers, who were averaging 41.8 percent from the field, to shoot 57.1 percent. Ilgauskas, a 7-foot-3 center, scored a game-high 29 points, shooting 13 of 21 from the floor.</p>
        <p>The Nets' sidelined center, Dikembe Mutombo, could only watch as his counterpart dominated and his team crumbled again.</p>
        <p>''It was a winnable game,'' Mutombo said. ''I can't believe it. The Cleveland Cavaliers, one of the sorriest teams in the N.B.A.''</p>
        <p>Inconsistency and fourth-quarter letdowns have plagued the Nets throughout the season. They shot 4 of 16 in the fourth quarter after entering it leading, 72-71. Jason Kidd was 0 for 8 in the second half, but still led the Nets with 21 points. The defeat spoiled his 30th birthday.</p>
        <p>''It's a little confusing,'' he said of the team's inconsistency. ''We're making it harder on ourselves.''</p>
        <p>It looked so easy at the beginning of the game. The Nets pounced on steals off their press and ran the fast break. Their first six baskets were dunks and they carried that momentum to a 13-point lead with 1:13 to play in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Leading by 51-43 with 4:14 to play in the second, the Nets committed four straight turnovers and the Cavs went on an 8-0 run to tie the score. Kidd's two free throws with 8.7 seconds left gave the Nets a 53-51 halftime lead.</p>
        <p>After a close third quarter, the Cavs seemed to make every clutch play. Smush Parker, the Cavaliers' first-year guard out of Fordham, was on the end of one highlight. With Cleveland ahead by 77-76, Parker got the ball off a Rodney Rogers miss and raced upcourt. With two Nets defenders in front of him, Parker switched the ball from his right to his left behind his back, then scooped it in to give the Cavs a 79-76 lead with 8:36 to play.</p>
        <p>The Nets still had a chance in the final four minutes. Kerry Kittles's layup tied the score at 85-85 with 4:01 to play, but the Nets missed their next two shots. Ricky Davis then hit a 16-foot jumper with 1:46 to play to give the Cavs an 87-85 lead. Kenyon Martin was called for a charge on the next possession and Ilgauskas dropped in a layup with 1:08 to play.</p>
        <p>After a timeout, Kidd missed a 3-pointer, then made two free throws to cut the Cavs' lead to 89-87 with 46.1 seconds to play. After Davis missed a jumper at the shot-clock buzzer, the Nets got the rebound with 20 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Kidd dribbled furiously upcourt, but just before he came into the paint, the ball bounced off his knee, off his foot and out of bounds. ''It just went off of everything,'' Kidd said. ''I was exploring to see if we could get a layup or a wide-open 3 and, unfortunately, the ball continued to go south.''</p>
        <p>So did the Nets' chances. Parker hit two free throws with 13.1 seconds left for a 91-87 lead. After Kidd made the first of two free throws, he intentionally missed the second. He got the rebound and tried a desperation 3-pointer with 3.7 seconds left, but it fell short. Jumaine Jones added two free throws after that.</p>
        <p>''We were hoping we could just gut it out,'' Kittles said. ''We're close down the stretch and we don't seem to get good shots, and the other guys are scoring. It's a problem.''</p>
