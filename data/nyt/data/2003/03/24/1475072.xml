        <p>Chicago wins best picture and five other Oscars while losing a few upsets to The Pianist, including Roman Polanski winning award for best director; winners include Nicole Kidman for best actress (The Hours), Adrien Brody for best actor (Pianist), Chris Cooper for best supporting actor (Adaptation) and Catherine Zeta-Jones for best supporting actress (Chicago); war in Iraq dims glamour of ceremonies only slightly, but it is reflected in several acceptance speeches, notably Michael Moore's for his Oscar for best documentary (Bowling for Columbine); Moore attacks Pres Bush as ficticious president leading war on ficticious grounds; comments are booed by many people in audience; photos (L)</p>

        <p>After days of fretting about how they might be toned down or whether it was even appropriate to hold them, the 75th Annual Academy Awards were pretty much business as usual in Hollywood tonight, with ''Chicago'' winning best picture and five other Oscars while losing a few upsets to ''The Pianist.''</p>
        <p>In the evening's biggest surprises, Adrien Brody, the only best actor nominee who had never won an Oscar, won for ''The Pianist,'' Roman Polanski's drama about an unlikely Holocaust survivor.

        <p>After days of fretting about how they might be toned down or whether it was even appropriate to hold them, the 75th Annual Academy Awards were pretty much business as usual in Hollywood tonight, with ''Chicago'' winning best picture and five other Oscars while losing a few upsets to ''The Pianist.''</p>
        <p>In the evening's biggest surprises, Adrien Brody, the only best actor nominee who had never won an Oscar, won for ''The Pianist,'' Roman Polanski's drama about an unlikely Holocaust survivor. Mr. Brody, a relatively little-known actor, beat out Nicolas Cage, Michael Caine, Daniel Day-Lewis and Jack Nicholson.</p>
        <p>Even more surprising, Mr. Polanski, who cannot travel to the United States because of an outstanding arrest warrant on a charge of statutory rape, was named best director over favorites Rob Marshall (''Chicago'') and Martin Scorsese (''Gangs of New York'').</p>
        <p>For best actress, the award went to Nicole Kidman, who had been widely expected to win for her performance, fake nose and all, in ''The Hours'' as the writer Virginia Woolf.</p>
        <p>''Chicago,'' based on the 1975 musical about celebrity-mad floozies using a corrupt justice system to transmute murder into fame, won for Catherine Zeta-Jones supporting performance as well as for film editing, costume design, art direction and sound.</p>
        <p>''The Pianist'' also won, in another surprise, for Ronald Harwood's adapted screenplay.</p>
        <p>Deciding that a toned-down event was preferable to a postponed one, even in the early days of an increasingly bloody conflict in Iraq, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences proceeded with the ceremonies in the Kodak Theater on Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
        <p>As a result, the most famous celebrities and powerful moguls in Hollywood found themselves struggling to strike the proper tone and keep their Technicolor smiles in place for the film industry's biggest annual rite of self-congratulation. Actually, it didn't seem like all that much of a struggle.</p>
        <p>Although the screaming throngs were missing from the street outside the theater -- a result of the academy's decision to forgo the red carpet runway -- once the stars were inside it was the usual glamour, with lavish gowns, borrowed jewels and men in tuxedos.</p>
        <p>Most winners kept politics out of their acceptance speeches, although a few made oblique references to peace. ''In light of all the troubles in this world, I wish us peace,'' said Chris Cooper, who won for best supporting actor for playing a near toothless Florida orchid thief in ''Adaptation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brody drew a standing ovation by making an explicit appeal for peace and for the safe return of American soldiers.</p>
        <p>''Whether you believe in Allah or God, may he watch over you, and pray for a peaceful and swift resolution to this war,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kidman, while accepting her award, asked: ''Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important.''</p>
        <p>Presenting the nominees for best original song, Barbra Streisand said, ''I am glad that I live in a country that guarantees every citizen, including artists, the right to say and to sing what you believe.''</p>
        <p>Several celebrities, like Colin Farrell and Susan Sarandon, limited their political statements to wearing one of the competing peace pins, either a circular peace symbol or a tiny sculpture of a dove.</p>
        <p>But Michael Moore, who won for best documentary for ''Bowling for Columbine,'' asked the four other nominees in his category to come up on stage with him. ''They are here in solidarity with me because we like nonfiction, and we live in fictitious times,'' Mr. Moore said.</p>
        <p>Scattered applause was drowned by a chorus of boos that echoed through the auditorium as Mr. Moore derided President Bush -- ''we are against this war'' -- and the catcalls continued until he disappeared.</p>
        <p>''It was so sweet backstage,'' Steve Martin, the host of the ceremonies, said a few minutes later. ''You should have seen it. The Teamsters are helping Michael Moore into the trunk of his limo.''</p>
        <p>The front-runner going into the evening's awards was ''Chicago,'' with 13 nominations. The evenings biggest loser was Martin Scorsese's ''Gangs of New York,'' which had 10 nominations and was the subject of a major Oscar campaign by Miramax, but ended up with no awards. And ''The Hours,'' widely considered one of the evening's front-runners, came in with 9 nominations, but won only 1, for Ms. Kidman's lead performance.</p>
        <p>In another surprise, the Oscar for best original song went to ''Lose Yourself'' by Eminem, who chose not to show up for the ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Miramax Films, which made ''Chicago'' and ''Gangs,'' and began the evening with a total of 40 nominations, also had two wins for its ''Frida'' to celebrate -- for its makeup and for Elliot Goldenthal's original score.</p>
        <p>Joining ''Chicago,'' ''Gangs'' and ''The Hours'' as nominees for best picture were ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers,'' which had once been a Miramax project and still includes the studio's chairmen, Bob and Harvey Weinstein, among its executive producers, and ''The Pianist,'' the only nominee with no Miramax connection.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polanski's drama was released by Focus Features, the newly formed specialty film division of Universal Pictures.</p>
        <p>The Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki won for best animated feature film for ''Spirited Away,'' which was distributed in the United States by Disney. ''The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'' won for its visual effects and sound editing.</p>
        <p>Salma Hayek (''Frida''), Diane Lane (''Unfaithful''), Julianne Moore (''Far From Heaven'') and Renée Zellweger (''Chicago'') were up for best actress with Ms. Kidman.</p>
        <p>One of the year's toughest contests pitted Miramax against Miramax in the race for best director. Harvey Weinstein, who vowed to do all he could to win an Oscar for Mr. Scorsese, ran a fierce campaign in favor of that director, although his chief competition was Mr. Marshall for ''Chicago.'' Along with Mr. Polanski and Mr. Scorsese, the other directing nominees were Pedro Almodóvar (''Talk to Her'') and Stephen Daldry (''The Hours'').</p>
        <p>Security for this year's ceremony was much stronger than usual. Barriers went up around the theater complex, and metal detectors and bag searches for everyone entering the complex slowed the arrivals.</p>
        <p>Fans were allowed onto the sidewalk across from the theater, but only after passing through metal detectors.</p>
        <p>All major streets around the theater had been closed by police, and uniformed officers kept a high profile. Police officers in riot gear were posted at either end of the block and other officers on motorcycles roared up and down the side streets.</p>
        <p>The academy had decided earlier in the week to soften the glitz at this year's awards, worried that it would be distasteful to watch jewel-draped celebrities twirling for photographers in the early days of the war.</p>
        <p>Most particularly, the academy eliminated the red-carpet arrivals area on the street outside the auditorium: a 100-yard runway down the center of Hollywood Boulevard, overlooked by hundreds of screaming fans on bleachers, a kind of celebrity fantasyland where couture met hauteur in a dance of clicking cameras and skimpy gowns.</p>
        <p>Instead, this year celebrities alighted at the curb and went straight into the theater's entrance corridor.</p>
        <p>Despite the cramped space and the mandate to avoid frivolity, most of the arriving celebrities found time to smile, wave and pose.</p>
        <p>Joan Rivers, doing her regular pre-Oscar show on the E! cable channel, was forced to move across the street to the Oscar Salon in the Roosevelt Hotel. Celebrities hungry for more camera time could pay their obeisance to Ms. Rivers.</p>
        <p>Dark colors and subdued outfits seemed to be the order of the weekend, as celebrities worried about striking an inappropriate pose of glamour and opulence. Still, the pre-Oscar shows like Ms. Rivers' found time to focus on the stars' handbags and pedicures and gift baskets.</p>
        <p>''Somebody stop me,'' Ms. Rivers screamed following a nasty blast aimed at one of the arriving celebrities. But nobody did.</p>
