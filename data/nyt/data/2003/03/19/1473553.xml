        <p>As war against Iraq looms, Qwest Communications International is adding to a six-month-old campaign of commercials that feature some employees who are also military reservists. The reservists appear and speak along with other employees in two of four commercials that began running Monday night. The new commercials, which carry the theme ''The spirit of service, there for you,'' was created by the Chicago office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, part of the FCB Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>Qwest, the regional telecommunications company serving 14 Western and Midwestern states, is not concerned about being perceived as opportunistic, said Joan J. Walker, executive vice president for corporate marketing and communications at Qwest in Denver. Rather, she said, the spots reflect ''a recognition that when you think about the spirit of service, there's no service that's greater than service to the country.''</p>

        <p>As war against Iraq looms, Qwest Communications International is adding to a six-month-old campaign of commercials that feature some employees who are also military reservists. The reservists appear and speak along with other employees in two of four commercials that began running Monday night. The new commercials, which carry the theme ''The spirit of service, there for you,'' was created by the Chicago office of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, part of the FCB Group division of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>Qwest, the regional telecommunications company serving 14 Western and Midwestern states, is not concerned about being perceived as opportunistic, said Joan J. Walker, executive vice president for corporate marketing and communications at Qwest in Denver. Rather, she said, the spots reflect ''a recognition that when you think about the spirit of service, there's no service that's greater than service to the country.''</p>
        <p>About 100 of Qwest's 50,000 employees are on military leaves of absence, Ms. Walker said.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T is running a similarly topical campaign. On Monday, 18 commercials carrying the theme ''Talk is good'' were introduced, encouraging consumers to exchange points of view on topics like gun control and affirmative action. One shows the word ''War?'' on screen. The AT&amp;T campaign is by the New York office of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising, part of the Young &amp; Rubicam division of the WPP Group.</p>
