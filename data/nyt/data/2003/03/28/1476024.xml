        <p>IT is matinee day at the Broadway musical ''Movin' Out.'' The band swings into the score by Billy Joel. The stage fills with lithe, propulsive dancers. One of them emerges from the group, suddenly drawing the eye and the heart with his radiant warmth, certainty and easy all-out performing. It is Ron De Jesus, for many years a deservedly acclaimed member of the Hubbard Street Dance Chicago company and now on the Broadway stage in the Twyla Tharp musical.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Jesus is also a typical stealth performer, a dancer who may be capable of knocking out octuple pirouettes with the best of them but who is much more important for an innate personal charisma that elevates a character or choreography to something beyond itself. In a time when dance is becoming a more competitive and technique-driven profession than ever before, performing like that is to be sought out and cherished. And it can be savored in a variety of dancers this weekend and over the next month, as dance builds to a full-throttle spring season.</p>

        <p>IT is matinee day at the Broadway musical ''Movin' Out.'' The band swings into the score by Billy Joel. The stage fills with lithe, propulsive dancers. One of them emerges from the group, suddenly drawing the eye and the heart with his radiant warmth, certainty and easy all-out performing. It is Ron De Jesus, for many years a deservedly acclaimed member of the Hubbard Street Dance Chicago company and now on the Broadway stage in the Twyla Tharp musical.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Jesus is also a typical stealth performer, a dancer who may be capable of knocking out octuple pirouettes with the best of them but who is much more important for an innate personal charisma that elevates a character or choreography to something beyond itself. In a time when dance is becoming a more competitive and technique-driven profession than ever before, performing like that is to be sought out and cherished. And it can be savored in a variety of dancers this weekend and over the next month, as dance builds to a full-throttle spring season.</p>
        <p>Some of the dancers are famous, others are not. Some, like Mikhail Baryshnikov, are taking on unexpected kinds of roles and some, like Mark Morris, are just their own familiar selves. Others, like Mr. De Jesus and the downtown dancers Paul Matteson and Lisa Gonzales, will inhabit the stage as if they had lived there all their lives. And some stand out, like young Kurt Douglas of the Limón Dance Company, for a quiet brilliance polished by an abiding love for their art.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baryshnikov has had a long career as a virtuoso star dancer but there was always a glint of the actor in him and he gets to impersonate an aging though jaunty anti-star in Eliot Feld's ''Mr. XYZ'' tonight and at several other performances by Mr. Feld's Ballet Tech at the Joyce Theater. Mr. Morris will be seen in ''Serenade,'' a new solo, and will join three other male dancers in his teasing ''Foursome'' in programs by the Mark Morris Dance Group at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matteson and Ms. Gonzales, a real-life as well as a performing duo, will dance ''And I Knew It Meant You Were Leaving,'' whose origins they laughingly describe as a de facto courting ritual, on Sunday at the Williamsburg Art neXus in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>And Mr. De Jesus, also a second-cast lead as the bewildered Tony, is one of the neighborhood pals who find their lives changed by the Vietnam War in ''Movin' Out'' at the Richard Rodgers Theater.</p>
        <p>The prime ingredient of stealth performing is simplicity. Along Mr. De Jesus's way from teenage performances of Latin social dancing to professional ballet, modern dance and Broadway, he encountered a veteran flamenco teacher named Edo who encouraged the young dancer to slow down, stop mimicking and just breathe. ''The doors just swung open and then I had a different concept of movement and how the simplest thing, like walking across the stage, was the most difficult thing to do with grace and command,'' Mr. De Jesus recalled. That revelation would come in handy at Hubbard Street, when it performed its Tharp repertory.</p>
        <p>Lou Conte, the company founder, insisted on clean, precise group dancing. Ms. Tharp insisted on engaging mind to muscle, as Mr. De Jesus puts it, with each dancer standing out individually in the group. ''Oh, mama,'' Mr. De Jesus said with a cheerful groan, recalling the difficult merge of styles. His belief in simplicity -- and in the idea that his characters are fundamentally knowable -- is the heart of his performing.</p>
        <p>A Matter of Trust</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris, who likes to feel ''oh, of course,'' when he watches someone else performing, is the über-naturalist of the group. He appears to be simply himself on the stage, a larger, older and more mussed creature than the stereotypical dancer. But whatever he is doing in performance seems to be, as he says of others, ''the only possible thing that could happen.''</p>
        <p>That is what he likes to see onstage, Mr. Morris said, citing the Wooster Group and others. ''Welcome to our show and trust us,'' he said. ''And you don't have to like it. It's like, 'Oh, great, I'm in the hands of someone who knows it and can do it' and it isn't just an indication of superiority. It's important to me that my new solo is dedicated to Lou Harrison, who was a good friend of mine and a wonderful artist who made you trust him to take you where he wanted.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Matteson, a Bessie Award-winning dancer, is the sneakiest of this weekend's stealth performers. Norman Rockwell might have painted him, with his tousled blond hair and sleepy amiability, as he slips like a chameleon through an extraordinary range of styles. But peer closer and there is a slight wariness to those wide-open eyes. And long after the curtain falls, it is often Mr. Matteson who lingers in the memory.</p>
        <p>Handling Uncertainty</p>
        <p>One reason may be that beneath that look of ease lies a churning existential uncertainty as well as the motivating process of calming and channeling it. ''I kind of turn all my neurotic energy into the work, almost like obsessing,'' Mr. Matteson said. ''I'm learning it's an enjoyable way of focusing on and interpreting the dance I'm doing. It then allows me not to have that all the time. I can actually have some life.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzales broke into the consciousness of uptown audiences last year in a stunning portrayal of an unraveling woman in Mr. Matteson's ''Take Me for Granted,'' which will be performed again at Dance Theater Workshop in May. Febrile and bittersweet, she provides a distinct contrast to Mr. Matteson's stage persona. But like Mr. De Jesus, she has learned the value of a simplicity, principally from the choreographer Deborah Hay.</p>
        <p>''It was more interesting to be put on the spot with nothing to do than it was to hide behind having something to do,'' Ms. Gonzales recalled. ''She would also tell me, 'Lisa, get out of character.' So I think of that a lot, especially when I don't know what to do or I'm afraid. I'll remember, 'Oh, it's O.K. to have nothing to do.' ''</p>
        <p>That point of view about performing may be peculiar to Ms. Gonzales's time as a dancer. Gone are the days of juicily over-the-top stardom, captured today only in comical all-male classical companies like Les Ballets Grandiva, which performs in mid-April at the John Jay Theater in Manhattan. There are a few fiery young technicians around, among them Charlie Neshyba-Hodges of Twyla Tharp Dance, which performs in the New York City area at the Tilles Center of Long Island University and at the Purchase College Performing Arts Center in mid-April.</p>
        <p>The difference today, however, is an infectious pleasure that warms the pyrotechnics and draws the audience in to a shared experience. Pride in the work tends to go hand in hand with an equally democratizing humility. Adam Hendrickson, who will perform with the New York City Ballet in a spring season that begins in late April at the New York State Theater, can turn on the fireworks but he also pours himself into the kind of acting roles that are less sought after today in ballet, performing with an interpretive depth and sympathy that is surprising in a young performer.</p>
        <p>Feeling Connections</p>
        <p>That humility may well be an effect of the stealth performer's belief that nothing in life is quite so important as the act of dancing. ''I love the feeling that I get from it,'' Mr. Douglas, the Limón dancer, said. ''It's almost like being transported to another world.''</p>
        <p>At 23, with a mere year and a half of professional dancing behind him and lead roles in store during the Limón season in late April at the Joyce, Mr. Douglas is a performer whose pure, flamelike physicality gives him the look of being one with what he is dancing. ''I totally am enveloped by my surroundings, my space, the environment I usually create for myself when I'm dancing,'' he said. ''I feel taken over by some higher force. Thank God for that feeling, because it really brought me out of a lot of turmoil. Dance saved my life. I was blessed. It's just a shame that not everyone can experience what I've had.''</p>
        <p>Of Guyanese descent, Mr. Douglas grew up in an impoverished and dangerous Brooklyn neighborhood where he was encouraged to train in dance by teachers at Intermediate School 271 in Ocean Hill-Brownsville. At the Boston Conservatory, dance teachers like Jennifer Scanlon and Yuriko taught him invaluable lessons about performing, among them how to ''not even be able to see who I'm dancing with but to know that they're there.''</p>
        <p>That sense of wholehearted connectedness to others on or off the stage, to the work being performed and to oneself is also important to Mr. Matteson and Ms. Gonzales. ''I find that it is like a need,'' Mr. Matteson said of dancing. ''It keeps me going. And it has to do with that state of giving it all, of entering into the work. I like the kind of person that you have to be in order to be vulnerable, to be honest. That's it. I find it worthwhile, even if you don't do it all the time but try all the time to be honest.''</p>
        <p>Finding Inspiration</p>
        <p>Ms. Gonzales talked of ''the ritual of preparing and then revealing yourself in this environment that has been put aside for that,'' as she described the stage.</p>
        <p>''There is some amazing sense of connection that I feel and learn and miss when I'm not getting to do it,'' she said. ''I can definitely identify with Paul, with opening up your whole self, putting yourself on the line. That's when it feels best.'' At such times, Ms. Gonzales said, there are no mistakes. As Mr. Douglas put it, a dancer who makes mistakes is performing at 150 percent of capacity.</p>
        <p>''That's what creates meaning,'' Ms. Gonzales said. ''I feel it shatters the idea of what movement means and puts it together in a different way. You understand something you didn't understand before. Then of course you forget it the next time!</p>
        <p>''We all desperately seek to feel connected and to feel real. Watching a performance that moves me profoundly, I feel I want to live. Those moments don't happen all the time. We make it through life.''</p>
        <p>One cold night on his way home, exhausted after a performance, Mr. De Jesus was recognized by a woman on a city bus. She talked to him of ''Movin' Out'' and its effect on her and her brother, whom she said the show had brought together. ''She was squeezing my hand,'' he recalled. ''My stop was coming up. She was bawling. I was overwhelmed. There I was just doing my do-de-do. And I thought, 'Oh, I can't take this for granted.' ''</p>
