        <p>IT all starts, Sunny Bates said, with a vacation or an innocent weekend visit to someplace new, and an idle daydream that goes something like this: ''I could live here. I could.''</p>
        <p>Next, you're riffling through penny-savers -- piled all too accessibly in the local shops and general stores -- and cruising the windows of real-estate offices. From there it's a short leap into a broker's S.U.V. for a tour of properties that you will imagine yourself living in, mentally redesign and furnish . . . and never, ever buy.</p>
        <p>You are a real-estate tease. And if you're anything like the charmingly unrepentant Ms. Bates, who runs a headhunting company in Manhattan when she isn't exclaiming over the homes of strangers, you have nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
        <p>''I have a very rich fantasy life about living in other places,'' she explained. ''I think it's because I've lived in the same apartment for so long, there's this real pent-up wanderlust.</p>
        <p>''There's never been a time when I've gone skiing and haven't looked at real estate,'' said Ms. Bates, who is divorced. ''Spring break, we went to Costa Rica, and I went to every single property there. Every time I go out to L.A., I decide what part of town I would like to live in. San Francisco, same thing. Even little places, like upstate near Rhinebeck. When I go to the museum in Mystic, I always look around Stonington.''</p>
        <p>''And any weekend trip,'' she added. ''I'll look at houses all day. You imagine what it's like to live that life. You think about commuting, and a different kind of career. There's always some welding business for sale someplace, or a sawmill. How would I feel owning a welding business? I could see that, maybe.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Sachs understands. ''It's mostly for fun,'' he said. ''I never buy the second home. That wouldn't make any sense -- I have too much need. There are so many of them, I couldn't stop.'' Mr. Sachs, a television writer in Los Angeles, where he owns ''a nice home,'' added: ''My fantasies are a bit daunted since I became a homeowner. I see that there is a lot involved. Sometimes it's just easier to go to a hotel.'' Nevertheless, he knows what he is. ''Lately,'' he said, ''I've been thinking about ranches.''</p>
        <p>As Ellen Bitton, the chief executive of the Park Avenue Mortgage Group in New York, put it, ''Look, all America has a national pastime with real estate, whether we're buying, selling -- or thinking.''</p>
        <p>While real-estate agencies have no centralized tracking system in place -- the sort of nationwide network that would allow for an easy exchange of information and perhaps composite sketches regarding property-joy-riders like Ms. Bates and Mr. Sachs -- experienced brokers are generally alert to window-shoppers.</p>
        <p>''We weed them out,'' said Evan R. Blish, the owner of Pinon Investments of Taos, N.M. ''You don't want to just provide the entertainment for somebody.'' Yet Mr. Blish, whose clients are in the market -- or, alternatively, not really in the market -- for second homes, retirement homes or properties they can rent out, said that sometimes that's exactly what he does.</p>
        <p>''You squire them around, and then they leave,'' he said, sounding like an abandoned suitor. ''And you don't hear from them. And then you hear, 'Yeah, we're going to Sun Valley,' 'We're going to Jackson,' 'Thanks for your time' and 'See you later.' ''</p>
        <p>''I'm one of those people,'' said Susan Breitenbach, a broker at Allan M. Schneider Associates in the Hamptons. She knows the type -- a couple of her clients (''they're like friends'') have been looking for 8 or 10 years -- and she recognizes it in her own mirror. ''We were in Nevis,'' she said. ''We looked. We got home. What were we thinking? It's too hard to get to. I feel sorry for those brokers. I'm still getting stuff in the mail from the one down in Naples. And Nevis, too; they call me.''</p>
        <p>The stories can be harrowing. ''There's somebody -- a big name, a dazzling name -- who's been looking for a property here for 30 years,'' said Diane Saatchi, the president of Dayton-Halstead Real Estate in the Hamptons. ''Builders come in, architects come in, plans are drawn up. The buyer is so earnest, bringing friends in, and has no idea how funny this all is. They bump into brokers they've used before and they're not even embarrassed.''</p>
        <p>So why is there never a sale?</p>
        <p>''There's always a good reason,'' Ms. Saatchi said. ''It's going to cost too much. Or someone told them it's not the best location.''</p>
        <p>Another notorious episode, she said, involved a man who would routinely visit the Hamptons to look at houses in the $2 million to $6 million range. ''Each weekend he would come out with a different date,'' she said. ''A couple of weeks would go by, he would show up with another woman. Some of them were lovely. He was friendly with a couple of brokers. He would drop celebrity names, refer to houses knowledgeably, have some coffee. Serious talks about the properties. I was out with him six times before I gave up. I realized we were part of the date. We were the foreplay.''</p>
        <p>No, he never bought.</p>
        <p>THOSE are just extreme examples of something far more common. ''You know what we call people who are waiting for the market to soften?'' Ms. Saatchi asked. ''Tenants. People are happy to rent for 10 years and say they're looking.'' They generally turn into real shoppers, she said, for specific reasons, like inheritance, marriage, divorce or retirement.</p>
        <p>Ms. Saatchi also brought up ''a not-unrelated problem: people who like to think about selling.'' These tend to list a property at a little more than it should be, and if someone comes close with a bid, they raise the price. When it comes to vacation homes, she said, ''it's about prestige and fantasy and glamour -- there's no urgency.''</p>
        <p>But in a way there is. For people like Sunny Bates it's as urgent as the need to do something pleasurable, even educational, on a weekend. (Ms. Bates, incidentally, is also looking for a new apartment in New York -- she has seen 80 in the last year -- and has fixed her eye on housing as varied as boats in marinas and ''a very cool Orthodox synagogue up in Harlem.'' For the record, she has actually bought real estate in the past.) ''It's a way to learn about the people who live there, the characteristics of the town,'' she said. ''If you get a good real estate agent they'll tell you about interesting squabbles. You get the texture of a place.''</p>
        <p>Still, right now, she said, ''I think I would rather just rent because I don't want to be tied to one place. It's more the pursuit -- of happiness, of a dream, or imagining a different life. It's a really cheap way to try a different identity.''</p>
        <p>It's also, apparently, genetic. ''I just got a phone call from my older daughter, who was effusively, wildly talking about a piece of real-estate information that had come into our home today,'' Ms. Bates said. ''She'd just gotten off the phone after spending an hour talking to the agent and wanted to schedule a time for us to go out and look at this property.''</p>
        <p>''My daughter,'' she said, laughing, ''is 15.''</p>
