        <p>Following are excerpts from a Feb. 26 letter to Director Robert S. Mueller III of the F.B.I. from Special Agent Coleen Rowley of the bureau's field office in Minneapolis. A full text is online: nytimes.com/national.</p>
        <p>At this critical point in our country's history I have decided to try once again, on an issue of even more consequence for the internal security posture of our country. That posture has been weakened by the diversion of attention from Al Qaeda to our government's plan to invade Iraq, a step that will, in all likelihood, bring an exponential increase in the terrorist threat to the U.S., both at home and abroad.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from a Feb. 26 letter to Director Robert S. Mueller III of the F.B.I. from Special Agent Coleen Rowley of the bureau's field office in Minneapolis. A full text is online: nytimes.com/national.</p>
        <p>At this critical point in our country's history I have decided to try once again, on an issue of even more consequence for the internal security posture of our country. That posture has been weakened by the diversion of attention from Al Qaeda to our government's plan to invade Iraq, a step that will, in all likelihood, bring an exponential increase in the terrorist threat to the U.S., both at home and abroad.</p>
        <p>In your recent testimony to the Senate, you noted that ''the Al Qaeda network will remain for the foreseeable future the most immediate and serious threat facing this country,'' adding that ''the prevention of another terrorist attack remains the F.B.I.'s top priority.'' You then noted that a ''U.S.-Iraq war could prompt Baghdad to more directly engage Al Qaeda and perhaps provide it with weapons of mass destruction.'' But you did not connect these very important dots. . . .</p>
        <p>What is the F.B.I.'s evidence with respect to a connection between Al Qaeda and Iraq? Polls show that Americans are completely confused about who was responsible for the suicidal attacks on 9/11, with many blaming Iraq. And it is clear that this impression has been fostered by many in the administration. As far as the F.B.I. is concerned, is the evidence of such a link ''bulletproof,'' as Defense Secretary Rumsfeld claims, or ''scant,'' as General Brent Scowcroft, chairman of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, has said? The answer to this is of key importance in determining whether war against Iraq makes any sense from the F.B.I.'s internal security point of view. If the F.B.I. does have independent data verifying such a connection, it would seem such information should be shared, at least internally within the F.B.I. . . .</p>
        <p>It is not clear that you have been adequately apprised of the potential damage to our liaison relationships with European intelligence agencies that is likely to flow from the growing tension over Iraq between senior U.S. officials and their counterparts in key West European countries.</p>
        <p>There are far more Al Qaeda operatives in Europe than in the U.S., and European intelligence services, including the French, are on the front lines in investigating and pursuing them. Indeed, the Europeans have successfully uncovered and dismantled a number of active cells in their countries.</p>
        <p>In the past, F.B.I. liaison agents stationed in Europe benefitted from the expertise and cooperation of European law enforcement and intelligence officers. Information was shared freely, and was of substantial help to us in our investigations in the U.S. You will recall that prior to 9/11, it was the French who passed us word of Moussaoui's link to terrorism. . . .</p>
        <p>It seems clear to me now that the decision to attack Iraq was taken some time ago and you, even as F.B.I. director, may be little more than a helpless bystander.</p>
        <p>Such an attack, though, may have grave consequences for your ability to discharge your responsibility to protect Americans, and it is altogether likely that you will find yourself a helpless bystander to a rash of 9/11's. The bottom line is this: We should be deluding neither ourselves nor the American people that there is any way the F.B.I., despite the various improvements you are implementing, will be able to stem the flood of terrorism that will likely head our way in the wake of an attack on Iraq. What troubles me most is that I have no assurance that you have made that clear to the president.</p>
