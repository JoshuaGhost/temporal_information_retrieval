        <p>"The Bleepin' Rules of the Road" (Feb. 16) brought back fond memories of my 38 years in the Transportation Department press office. Some of my favorite traffic advisories suggested by the public were a one-way sign with arrows pointing in opposite directions, pedestrian "Walk" signs that blinked "Run Like Hell," and a "no parking" sign for church and synagogue entrances, in Old English lettering, that commanded "Thou Shalt Not Park."</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"The Bleepin' Rules of the Road" (Feb. 16) brought back fond memories of my 38 years in the Transportation Department press office. Some of my favorite traffic advisories suggested by the public were a one-way sign with arrows pointing in opposite directions, pedestrian "Walk" signs that blinked "Run Like Hell," and a "no parking" sign for church and synagogue entrances, in Old English lettering, that commanded "Thou Shalt Not Park."</p>
        <p>I also recall that the city's first official foreign-language traffic sign was hung at a busy corner in Little Italy in 1951. It read: "Passaggio per Pedoni," or ''Pedestrian Crossing.'' But like true New Yorkers, pedestrians responded by crossing in the middle of the block.</p>
        <p>My favorite was hung in my office in 1976. When my friends in the traffic sign shop heard I had quit smoking, they sent me a standard-sized traffic sign that read "No Smoking, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m."</p>
