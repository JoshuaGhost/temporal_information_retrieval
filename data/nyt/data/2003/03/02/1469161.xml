        <p>WHEN her three businesses started booming, and her two teenage children became more fussy about their food, Isabel Milano began to dread the dinner hour.</p>
        <p>Ms. Milano, whose work and civic duties began to make her life complicated, especially over the holidays, recalled an article she had once read about personal chefs. So she told her husband, Bernard, a corporate pilot who keeps irregular hours, that hiring a chef topped her Christmas wish list. Mr. Milano scoured the Internet and found Supper Solutions, based in Pleasantville and the brainchild of Debbie Campos.</p>
        <p>''Mealtime seemed to be so disjointed; now there's a calming effect around dinner,'' said Ms. Milano. ''Some people go to the gym to relieve stress; I have someone come in and cook.''</p>
        <p>Most personal chefs take food and cookware to a client's home, prepare a couple of weeks' worth of meals, some of which are frozen, and leave the place spic and span. Others cook and package meals at a commercial kitchen, since health codes prohibit chefs from selling the food that they prepare in their own home, said Heather McGill, the Westchester County Health Department spokeswoman. Chefs must also have certification in safe food handling.</p>
        <p>Increased sophistication about food, spurred in part by star television cooks and celebrity restaurateurs, helped create this new niche in the food service industry, said Candy Wallace, executive director of the American Personal Chef Association, founded in San Diego in 1995.</p>
        <p>''We also get a lot of clients with dietary restrictions and people watching their weight,'' she said. ''People can custom-tailor their food. You can't really do that in a restaurant, but if you hire a personal chef, you can sit there and watch while your meal is cooked if you want.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wallace's organization counts 3,000 members, she said, 1,000 more than in 2001.</p>
        <p>The industry is also an outgrowth of the country's convenience culture. ''Over the years, we started with a baby sitter in the house and we have a house cleaner,'' said Nancy Rossnagel of Pleasantville, who has brought Ms. Campos into her home to cook for her family of four twice a month for the last three years.</p>
        <p>''Having a chef was the next logical step,'' she said. ''My husband and I had a rivalry over who could get home later, because whoever came home first had to cook dinner. Now, we pick the menus, we get great variety, and all we have to do is wash the dishes,''</p>
        <p>Being a personal chef offers unrivaled flexibility, said Cory Goodman, who lives in New Rochelle and defected from the restaurant world three years ago.</p>
        <p>''I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit and this gives me such a better quality of life,'' said Mr. Goodman, aka Chef Thyme. ''I don't have to work 80 hours a week chained to a hot oven for someone else anymore.''At 8 a.m., Mr. Goodman haunts his favorite shops on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, then heads to his kitchen space at the Elks Club in Mount Vernon, which he rents for $300 a month. The $150,000 worth of new Vulcan equipment there is of comparable quality to the kind he used at La Reserve in Manhattan, the Century Club in Purchase and Abigail Kirsch at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. He works until about 2 p.m. and then delivers his bounty.</p>
        <p>''People want fine dining in the comfort of their homes,'' he said recently as he mixed the ingredients for a batch of crab cakes in a large metal bowl. Along with the crab cakes, Mr. Goodman fixed pot roast with caramelized vegetables and veal scaloppine with prosciutto de Parma and tomato concasse. . Three meals for two people -- six entree servings each plus side dishes consisting of a starch and a vegetable -- cost $195, plus the ingredients. It's about five hours of work, including planning with the client, shopping, cooking, cleaning and delivering.</p>
        <p>For dinner parties and romantic repasts, he makes house calls, arriving with his utensils stuffed into a rubber toolbox; he also conducts cooking classes.</p>
        <p>This is Ms. Campos's second career, which she undertook three years ago when her children were 3 and 10 and had just gone through a divorce. She showed a knack for the culinary arts and friends suggested she try catering, but the hours -- nights and weekends -- put her off. She puts in one shift a day, from about 9:30 a.m. to 2 p. m., usually in a client's home. She took courses at the New School and at the United States Profesional Chef Association, based in New Mexico. She charges $350 for 10 meals for two, which includes five different dishes plus sides. Food is included, but she levies a $50 surcharge for each child. She also sometimes cooks for small gatherings in the evenings.</p>
        <p>''When you look at the cost factor versus the time we gain as a family, it's well worth it,'' said Ms. Milano, adding that each of her family's meals cost about $45. ''It would definitely be more expensive to eat in restaurants and do takeout every night.''</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Campos and Mr. Goodman declined to say how much they were earning as personal chefs.</p>
        <p>One pitfall in a profession with such obvious upside potential is frequent client turnover. Some clients call irregularly, said Ms. Campos, who currently has about a dozen clients and cooks three to four days a week. Mr. Goodman said, ''Dinner party clients are especially loyal, but for the most part, I have all new weekly meal clients than I did six months ago.'' Sept. 11 and the resulting downturn has also cramped demand.</p>
        <p>''It seems like we were at the cusp of a trend and then 9/11 happened,'' said Julia Maillor, a second-career personal chef who started her service, Your Kitchen Aid, three years ago. She lives in Millbrook and serves clients in Dutchess, Putnam and northern Westchester Counties.</p>
        <p>Felicia Kramer, a chocolatier who lives in Cortlandt Manor, had been hiring Mr. Goodman steadily for more than a year. But the terror attacks, combined with the financial crunch of starting a new business, meant that she had to stop his services.</p>
        <p>''I miss it terribly,'' she said. ''But I did have him for a large dinner party and then -- surprise -- whenever anyone gave a party they were running around trying to outdo each other, asking, 'What chef did you get?'''</p>
        <p>Relationships have always developed and deepened over food. ''That's why they're called 'personal' chefs,'' Ms. Wallace said. ''Short of sex, what could be more intimate than food?''</p>
        <p>As with love, there are inevitable complications: ''When we first served Debbie's meals to friends and they complimented us, we thought 'Should we divulge the secret?''' said Ms. Rossnagel. ''Once my mother-in-law approved, it really became O.K. Besides, Debbie is now like part of the family.''</p>
