        <p>LOOKS can be deceiving. What you see is not necessarily what you get at Seed, a hot new American restaurant at 25 North Middle Neck Road in Great Neck (516-773-3690).</p>
        <p>Seed is a slick, sophisticated spot that looks more expensive than it is, with graceful curved booths, tables and surfaces, an indented wavy ceiling, tiny drop lights and a wall of multicolored fabric baffling. Its upfront bar is often busy and on weekends generates an almost deafening roar.</p>
        <p>Once inside, patrons come upon the chef's table, an appealing antipasto-like panorama of diverse colors, shapes and textures. It looks like a culinary nirvana, but like the décor it's somewhat misleading. Both the table's room-temperature tidbits (three for $5, five for $11 and seven for $14) and the dishes on the menu can be quite good but almost as often they are lackluster.</p>
        <p>Seed specializes in sophisticated, fresh American cooking using mostly organic ingredients with no butter or cream and little oil. To compensate for the rich flavors of the relatively high-calorie, high-cholesterol ingredients it doesn't use, the kitchen uses reductions and some creative Asian spins in its menu, which is mostly slanted to fish-, chicken- and vegetables with only 2 of 12 entrees containing red meat. Sometimes that works, sometimes it doesn't.</p>
        <p>Diners are greeted with a basket of rolls that boast varying textures, tastes and densities, along with a wonderful, velvety white-bean dip. Everyone is encouraged to stroll up to the chef's table, pick out what appeals to them and order it from their server. I chose three one night as an appetizer and seven on another as an entree. Only two (ratatouille and mushrooms cooked in olive oil and balsamic vinegar) stood out in what was a mostly bland assemblage (Israeli couscous, nutty couscous, grilled eggplant, Asian slaw, baked cauliflower, eggplant, crostini, asparagus goat cheese rolls and pasta salad of orecchiette with feta, arugula and tomato).</p>
        <p>Dishes from the menu fared better. A tomato-potato-fennel soup ($4) had a rustic graininess and a soothing tomato-dominated flavor, but a bowl of vegetable soup ($4) cried out for salt. Starter successes were a pear and stilton pizzetta ($9), steamed shrimp dumplings ($7) and a baked herb-crusted goat-cheese medallion ($6).</p>
        <p>The unlikely, though intriguing fruit and cheese combination atop a thin, delicate pizza crust worked surprisingly well. The five shrimp dumplings contained whole shrimp and were given a welcome wallop from their hot yellow mustard dip, while the melting medallion of herb-infused goat cheese came on greens with cubed red and golden beets.</p>
        <p>A mound of green salad ($5) was somewhat enlivened with dried cherries and sunflower and pumpkin seeds but was otherwise quite ordinary. Pass on the vegetable rice paper rolls ($7), which had admirable texture but undetectable taste.</p>
        <p>Order the Moroccan barbecued salmon ($17) as a main course and you will be rewarded with a flaky, juicy slab of fish with a splash of slightly sweet, well-seasoned sauce accompanied by a mountain of mixed couscous pilaf and sautéed Savoy cabbage.</p>
        <p>Other main course contenders were grilled herb-rubbed flank steak ($17), grilled mahi mahi ($18) and spinach-stuffed roasted chicken breast ($17). Although flank steak is sometimes a tough cut of meat, it was thin-sliced, medium rare, soft going here with a wild rice and cherry pilaf kept moist by a port reduction. The mahi mahi, with its crusty surface, arrived swimming in a bowl of tomato saffron broth inhabited by baby vegetables. Juicy spinach was tucked into the moist chicken breasts, which were joined with pale green basil mashed potatoes and root vegetables.</p>
        <p>Avoid the boring rigatoni with jumbo shrimp ($18) , which was prepared separately and then assembled. Ditto for the oven-roasted lasagna ($14), a mass of mushy vegetables with little pasta and no distinctive flavors, and the orange ginger shrimp ($19). The latter offered five respectable orange- and ginger-touched shrimp around a pallid centerpiece of dry, unseasoned rice, zucchini, sweet potatoes and mushrooms.</p>
        <p>We had two very different experiences at Seed. An attentive waitress kept an eye on our table, anticipated our needs, described each dish and knew who ordered every one. But an over-friendly fellow spent much of his time talking to bar patrons, often disappeared completely and was a ''who ordered the soup of the day?'' type.</p>
        <p>There were few mixed messages at dessert time. Almost all of them were excellent. Try the warm doughnut-shaped chocolate lava cake ($6) with its runny molten middle, the fresh pear tart ($6) with its flaky, thin crust and fanned-out fruit slices, the slab of substantial, dense American cheesecake ($6) united with berries and whipped cream, or the Belgian waffle ($8) festooned with berries, melon, granola and vanilla ice cream. The apple crumb ($6) and peach and blackberry crisp with their crunchy topping and ripe fruity interiors were commendable. Both were billed as ''hot.'' The crisp was, the apple crumb was not.</p>
