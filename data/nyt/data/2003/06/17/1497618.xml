        <p>The American Express Company agreed to buy a British asset manager, Threadneedle, from Zurich Financial Services for $570 million, the companies said. The deal was a continuation of asset sales by Zurich Financial and will expand American Express's asset management business in Europe. Zurich Financial, which lost $3.4 billion in 2002, has been selling units that have been losing money and that do not fit with its core insurance operations. Threadneedle has about $70 billion in assets under management.</p>
