        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki said this week that he personally opposed the underground bus-parking area that planners have proposed building beneath the memorial to victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.</p>
        <p>The statement, which the governor made on Thursday night in a private meeting with representatives of victims' relatives, has given new hope to those who oppose the idea of bus parking in the former basement area of the trade center. Many family members consider those and other areas near the site of the former twin towers to be sacred ground.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki told the family members that he has directed rebuilding officials to look for alternative sites for the garage, according to people who attended the meeting. A spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki also confirmed the statements.</p>
        <p>One group of victims' relatives that attended the meeting, the Coalition of 9/11 Families, said in a statement that the family members were ''elated'' by the governor's position. Mr. Pataki also told those at the meeting that he considered the ''footprints'' of the twin towers to extend from ground level all the way down to bedrock, some 70 feet below.</p>
        <p>Many family groups want the areas beneath the tower footprints to remain void of any construction, an accommodation that would further cramp a possible underground parking area at the site.</p>
        <p>The governor's remarks are likely to continue to inflame disagreements between the relatives of 9/11 victims and residents of Lower Manhattan. The residents say they believe the parking area is needed for buses that are likely to bring millions of tourists each year to ground zero after the memorial is completed.</p>
        <p>Mollie Fullington, a spokeswoman for the governor, said yesterday that Mr. Pataki had not completely ruled out the bus terminal. But other officials in the rebuilding effort said it was unlikely that the bus garage would be built at the trade center since Mr. Pataki told the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns the trade center site, and the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the development of the memorial, to look for alternative locations.</p>
        <p>Matthew Higgins, the chief operating officer of the development corporation, said that the agency had already begun looking for alternative sites. The Port Authority considers the issue to be the responsibility of the development corporation, which is overseeing construction of the memorial.</p>
        <p>Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, whose jurisdiction includes the trade center site, said yesterday that downtown residents did not oppose placing the bus parking area somewhere else. ''But it needs to be within an extremely close proximity,'' Ms. Wils said.</p>
        <p>Downtown residents have long complained about commuter buses that spend the day parked in Lower Manhattan, sometimes idling for hours. ''It's a very bad environmental and safety issue,'' Ms. Wils said, one that would be made worse by buses carrying visitors to the memorial.</p>
        <p>Rebuilding officials have estimated that 5 million people will visit the memorial each year, or 8,000 to 50,000 people daily, with 15 percent to 25 percent arriving by bus. That will require parking for more than 100 buses, rebuilding officials have said.</p>
        <p>The Coalition of 9/11 Families suggested yesterday that officials consider a bus garage on West 15th Street, currently owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, as a parking area. But Ms. Wils said she believed a site so far from the trade center would not reduce street congestion around the memorial, because buses would have to travel back and forth.</p>
