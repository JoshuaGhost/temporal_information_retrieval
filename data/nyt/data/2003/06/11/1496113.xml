        <p>'The Dreams of Webzines Fizzle Out; Online Magazines Scramble for Readers and Ads'</p>
        <p>In this article about the declining fortunes of online magazines, Mr. Blair quoted Michael Hirschorn, then editor in chief of Inside.com, a Web site, since closed, for news media and entertainment industry professionals.

That article never appeared. When approached by Mr. Blair in early March for another article, Mr. Hirschorn said, he declined to be interviewed, because by that point his company, like many other new-media firms, was struggling.</p>
