        <p>A woman from Long Branch, N.J., was arrested yesterday after she called in a bomb threat from an academic building at Princeton University, two days after calling in a similar threat on another New Jersey campus, the police said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Geraldine M. Dametz, 46, called the police in Long Branch, on the Jersey Shore, about 11 a.m. yesterday, saying she was at Princeton with a bomb, said Chief Charles Davall of the Princeton Borough police. She told the police that she ''wouldn't go peacefully,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Chief Duvall added that Ms. Dametz had had ''a personal disenchantment'' with a man who now works at Princeton University and used to work at Monmouth University in Long Branch, where she also once worked. Monmouth was the target of the first threat.</p>
        <p>Officers in Long Branch called the campus police, who tracked Ms. Dametz to the Wallace Social Sciences Building, Chief Davall said.</p>
        <p>Police officers, Mercer County sheriff's deputies and a state police bomb squad rushed to the campus. Ms. Dametz was found in a conference room and arrested. No bomb was found.</p>
