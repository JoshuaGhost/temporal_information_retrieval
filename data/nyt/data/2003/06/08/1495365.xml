        <p>AMANDA BRIGHT@HOME</p>
        <p>By Danielle Crittenden.</p>
        <p>Warner, $23.95.</p>
        <p>In her first novel, Danielle Crittenden, the author of ''What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us,'' positions her protagonist in the tradition of flustered 30-something heroines -- the twist being that this neurotic cappuccino drinker is a Washington stay-at-home mother of two. Though Crittenden has an insider's easy way with the agonies of Beltway parties and private school interviews (her husband is David Frum, a former speechwriter for the current president), she lacks affection for her characters and the sharp insight of a true satirist. Poor unfunny Amanda is too disconnected from her overactive children and her workaholic, Scotch-swilling mate to register as anything but sad and self-pitying. Marriage and motherhood are to Crittenden a grueling, unpleasant lot, but safer than career or spinsterhood. One of Amanda's best friends is an ambitious, millionaire-chasing pundit who ''used her beauty the way an increasingly desperate gambler plays his dwindling stack of chips.'' Her mother is a shrill feminist activist who ''had long ago shorn away every aspect of her appearance that might be misconstrued as feminine.'' Eventually Crittenden throws in life-changing plot twists meant to illuminate the rightness of Amanda's priorities. Instead, they illustrate the shallowness of a story that relies more on gimmickry than persuasion.</p>
