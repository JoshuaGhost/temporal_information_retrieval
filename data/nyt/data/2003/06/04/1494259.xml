        <p>The State Senate's co-president, John O. Bennett III, whose status as New Jersey's highest-ranking Republican elected official has been imperiled by questions about his law firm's billing practices, survived a primary challenge today, handily defeating a conservative opponent.</p>

        <p>The State Senate's co-president, John O. Bennett III, whose status as New Jersey's highest-ranking Republican elected official has been imperiled by questions about his law firm's billing practices, survived a primary challenge today, handily defeating a conservative opponent.</p>
        <p>Since early this year, when a newspaper in his home county, Monmouth, began printing exposés accusing Mr. Bennett's law firm of overcharging a local town government, many Republicans have begun pressuring Mr. Bennett to relinquish the shared Senate leadership job, and perhaps resign from office completely.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bennett conducted an aggressive grass-roots campaign -- running cable television ads and radio spots, and walking door to door to ask constituents for support -- and appeared jubilant today as returns showed him winning a comfortable victory over Richard J. Pezzullo.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bennett did not say whether he would step down as the Republican president of the evenly divided State Senate, he sounded a defiant note about his prospects in the fall. ''I'm ready for this campaign,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''I just hope whoever the Democratic candidate is will be ready, because they're going to have to be supporting the governor's policies.''</p>
        <p>Among Democrats, Mayor Glenn D. Cunningham of Jersey City emerged as the biggest winner in today's primaries, capturing the nomination for State Senate in the 31st District over Harvey Smith, who had the backing of Representative Robert Menendez, Gov. James E. McGreevey and the State General Assembly speaker, Albio Sires.</p>
        <p>By using his base in Jersey City to face down the biggest powers in the state, Mr. Cunningham, a former U.S. marshal, has established himself as a substantial force in Democratic politics.</p>
        <p>If he wins in November, the tradition of senatorial courtesy, which allows a state senator veto power over any appointment in his district, would give Mr. Cunningham substantial clout with which to challenge Mr. Menendez's control of Hudson County.</p>
        <p>''Not only did I win, but my whole slate won,'' Mr. Cunningham said, referring to the legislative candidates he had been supporting. ''What it means is that the time of machine tactics is dead, and that the negative campaign tactics that people use is a turnoff to the people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cunningham also said that he hoped his victory sent a message. ''Bob Menendez is a good congressman, but he wants to be other things. He shouldn't be trying to run cities, and now, others are seeing that they can be free from the machine.''</p>
        <p>Political incumbents generally fared well across the state, but Joseph V. Doria, the former speaker of the General Assembly, appeared to be in a close race in his bid for the Democratic nomination in his Hudson County Assembly district. He had been expected to win handily over his three opponents, Louis Manzo, Anthony Chiappone and Elba Perez-Cinciarelli.</p>
        <p>In Newark, Mayor Sharpe James, who is also a state senator, appeared to win handily over Luis Quintana in the Democratic Senate primary. In Morris County, Senator Robert J. Martin defeated Jay Webber, a conservative who had lambasted him as being ''too liberal for too long.''</p>
        <p>Tonight's results set the stage for a bitter and expensive battle for control of the Legislature this fall. The parties have already spent nearly $22 million on the primaries, according to state election records.</p>
        <p>Democrats hold a 42-to-37 edge in the General Assembly, and the State Senate is divided 20 to 20.</p>
