        <p>WITH Congress having gone after corporate America with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, is it time for it to turn its attention to the mutual fund industry?</p>
        <p>The head of the House subcommittee with responsibility for mutual funds introduced legislation last week that could give investors more information about the fees they are paying, and perhaps in the process spur more price competition among funds.</p>
        <p>But the legislation, proposed by Representative Richard H. Baker, Republican of Louisiana, sidestepped a suggestion from the Securities and Exchange Commission that would have led to significant changes in the way funds operate -- and that would have brought strong opposition from the fund industry and from Wall Street.</p>
        <p>It is still unclear if the legislation will be enacted. In an interview, Mr. Baker said he hopes that his capital markets subcommittee will report out a bill in July, and that the House will act this year.</p>
        <p>In the current atmosphere, he said, ''any reasonable reform will pass.''</p>
        <p>But Senator Richard C. Shelby, an Alabama Republican and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has shown little interest in the issue, and his spokesman said there are ''no plans to introduce similar legislation in the near future on the Senate side.''</p>
        <p>Still, the fact that a Republican House is considering legislation is an indication that some legislators believe that investors are still angry about the money they have lost since the stock market peaked in 2000.</p>
        <p>One idea being pushed by Mr. Baker would require fund companies to inform investors, on their account statements, of their share of the fees paid by the funds they own. An investor could see that his holdings in a fund produced fees for the management company of, say, $300 last year, even as he lost $1,000.</p>
        <p>''Many people do not understand the consequence of the fee schedule on their net return,'' Mr. Baker said. ''Without being critical of the managed fund industry, there are some funds whose fee schedule is excessive. And it may be the case that individuals who are using the fund are not aware of that.''</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. is not enthusiastic about that idea. In a 120-page report produced at Mr. Baker's request, the S.E.C. questioned whether compiling that information would be worth the expense. It noted that many investors buy funds through brokerage firms that maintain master accounts in many funds, and that it would fall to the brokerage firm to do all those calculations.</p>
        <p>As an alternative, the S.E.C. suggested that funds could be required to disclose fees paid on a $10,000 account. Such disclosures would be easily comparable, and easily computed because funds already calculate expense ratios, which are fees as a percentage of net assets. Such numbers would also be easier for investors to ignore, something that would be fine with the fund industry.</p>
        <p>It does not cost 10 times as much to run a $1 billion fund as it does to run a $100 million one, so it makes sense that fund fees, as a percentage of assets, would decline as funds grew larger. But there is some evidence that this has not happened. Fund fees at large stock funds have risen a bit in recent years.</p>
        <p>IN discussing that phenomenon, the S.E.C. said the obvious numbers might not be accurate. Some investors who used to pay ''loads,'' upfront sales charges not counted in fund fees, may now be buying funds without an upfront sales charge but with a so-called 12b-1 marketing fee paid by all shareholders. The overall cost might not be higher, even though reported fees are up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker also wants investors to have better information on a variety of other things related to fund expenses, including the structure by which fund managers are compensated. He wants more disclosure of marketing fees paid by the fund management company -- presumably out of its profits from the management fees -- and of practices like using directed brokerage commissions to encourage sales of the fund.</p>
        <p>Some of the largest costs borne by fund shareholders are completely hidden. Brokerage commissions are included in the cost of shares and not broken out as separate fees in shareholder reports. Transaction costs, such as the impact the fund's order might have had on the price of the stock being traded, are completely invisible. Mr. Baker would like to require funds to disclose the transaction costs, including commissions, for each fund.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C., in its study, says there is no easy way to get such a number. It suggests that because funds that trade more often generally incur greater transaction costs, more should be done to highlight the turnover ratio that shows how actively a fund trades.</p>
        <p>Some of those commission expenses, however, are not necessary for the buying and selling of stocks. In addition to commissions that may be used to encourage brokers to sell funds, there are large payments of ''soft dollar'' commissions. In those cases, funds pay commissions higher than they would have to pay just for trading, and in return receive research or services. That is legal under a 1975 law. The S.E.C. suggested tightening the law, perhaps to bar the use of such money to buy market information services from companies like Bloomberg or Reuters.</p>
        <p>Such a change in the law would arouse a lot of opposition. Fund companies would fear having to pay for some services out of their other fees, meaning that profits would be lower or visible charges, like management fees, would have to rise. The companies that provide the services would fear that they might sell fewer of them. Brokers that specialize in soft-dollar business would fear a decline in business.</p>
        <p>MR. BAKER did not pick up on that idea, which is similar to a proposal that is pending in Britain. Instead, he called for better disclosure of soft-dollar arrangements to a fund's board of directors, and for an S.E.C. study of the issue.</p>
        <p>As for the boards, Mr. Baker proposed giving the S.E.C. greater authority regarding the standard for whether a director is considered independent of fund management. He also proposed raising the required proportion of independent directors to 67 percent from 40 percent.</p>
        <p>Current law states that a director can be deemed independent if he or she has not worked for the fund management company for two years. That has led to companies providing director positions to former employees as a kind of retirement benefit. The S.E.C. suggested barring that, but the Baker bill did not address the issue.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker said he was open to changes in his bill, which he said contained provisions that ''the S.E.C. staff and my staff agreed are minimal opening steps.''</p>
        <p>If the bill passes as written, investors will have more information about how their funds operate, and clearer knowledge of both how high a fund's expenses are and where the money is going. Funds would have to incur some additional costs to provide that information. But the bill stops short of requiring any major changes in the ways funds operate.</p>
