        <p>Israel's archaeological experts declared today that an ancient limestone burial box, which bears an inscription suggesting it held the remains of Jesus' brother James, is a modern forgery.</p>
        <p>When the existence of the burial box, or ossuary, was announced in October, it stirred great excitement as potentially the earliest historical artifact linked to Jesus.</p>
        <p>But Israel's Antiquities Authority said it had found overwhelming evidence that the inscription on the box was a fake produced in modern times. ''The bottom line is that every single scholar who examined this came to the conclusion that the inscription was not authentic,'' said Dr. Gideon Avni, director of excavations and surveys for the Antiquities Authority. ''It was done recently by a very skillful artist.''</p>
        <p>The authority also said a small stone tablet, purported to be from the ninth century B.C. and containing Hebrew-language instructions on maintaining the First Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, was also a fake. The tablet had linguistic mistakes and Hebrew words of modern origin that could not have been used at the time, the authority said.</p>
        <p>An Israeli collector, Oded Golan, had possession of both items, and had tried to sell the tablet for $2 million, said Shuka Dorfman, head of the Antiquities Authority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golan rejected the findings. ''I am certain that the committee is wrong regarding its conclusions,'' he was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>The police have been investigating the case with the help of the Antiquities Authority, but no arrests have been made.</p>
        <p>The 20-inch-long ossuary, common in Jewish burial ceremonies in the first centuries B.C. and A.D., has an inscription in Aramaic reading, ''James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus.''</p>
        <p>The New Testament on several occasions says Jesus had a brother named James, who became a leader of a Christian group in Jerusalem after the crucifixion of Jesus.</p>
        <p>James was executed by stoning in A.D. 63, according to the first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus.</p>
        <p>The scholars concluded that the ossuary was an original dating back 2,000 years, but that the inscription on it was much more recent, though they could not pinpoint the date.</p>
        <p>The inscription had been partly filled in with dirt, carbon and small flecks of gold in an attempt to make it look ancient, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Also, the latter part of the inscription, which refers to Jesus, is in a separate style of writing, the Antiquities Authority said.</p>
        <p>Scholars have been debating the authenticity since the ossuary became public last October, and some leading experts said they believed that it was genuine.</p>
        <p>Mr. Golan said he had bought the ossuary from an antiquities dealer in Jerusalem's Old City in the mid-1970's, but did not know the name of the seller or the place where it had been excavated.</p>
