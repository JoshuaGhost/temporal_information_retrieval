        <p>Ichiro Suzuki finished his round of batting practice, picked up his glove and trotted out to right field yesterday afternoon. Suzuki and the Seattle Mariners carried baseball's best record into last night's game, but they had never played the Mets, and Suzuki wanted to gauge the outfield conditions at Shea Stadium. As a coach positioned behind second base hit fly balls, Suzuki raced in or back, and even caught one behind his back.</p>
        <p>But Suzuki had no defense for the ball that Cliff Floyd hit in the seventh inning. Floyd's solo home run became the difference in a 3-2 Mets victory, ending the Mariners' nine-game winning streak and providing the Mets a brief respite from their mounting losses and injuries.</p>

        <p>Ichiro Suzuki finished his round of batting practice, picked up his glove and trotted out to right field yesterday afternoon. Suzuki and the Seattle Mariners carried baseball's best record into last night's game, but they had never played the Mets, and Suzuki wanted to gauge the outfield conditions at Shea Stadium. As a coach positioned behind second base hit fly balls, Suzuki raced in or back, and even caught one behind his back.</p>
        <p>But Suzuki had no defense for the ball that Cliff Floyd hit in the seventh inning. Floyd's solo home run became the difference in a 3-2 Mets victory, ending the Mariners' nine-game winning streak and providing the Mets a brief respite from their mounting losses and injuries.</p>
        <p>Earlier yesterday, Tom Glavine said he still had not decided about whether to make his next start. Pain in his left elbow forced Glavine to leave the second game of a doubleheader Thursday. Andrew Rokito, the Mets' team physician, told Glavine last night that he could wait until tomorrow before deciding, but ''he said if I'm not drastically better in 48 hours, he probably would advise me to skip a start.''</p>
        <p>Glavine, 37, was found to have a bone spur in the elbow as part of his routine physical before signing a three-year, $35 million contract last December. Rokito told Glavine that another magnetic resonance imaging exam was unnecessary because Rokito did not think the spur could have grown much in six months.</p>
        <p>Glavine has avoided the disabled list throughout his 17-year career. Thirteen Mets players have already spent time there this season, although Mike Stanton and Jay Bell were activated yesterday.</p>
        <p>Glavine's next start is scheduled for Wednesday, but General Manager Steve Phillips said the Mets could delay that until Saturday because of a day off on Monday. Glavine conceded that going on the disabled list made sense, but he was resisting even missing one start and was ''holding out a small percentage of hope, that there's a miracle recovery or cure.''</p>
        <p>''That part is the hardest thing for me to come to grips with, but that's what I'm going to have to do,'' he said. ''I'll be better off being smart and letting the doctors make the decision. If they feel I'm better off pitching 10 days from now rather than five days from now, that would probably be the smart thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Glavine (5-6) said his elbow did not feel worse, but he did not report any improvement from Thursday, when he allowed five runs, four hits and five walks in a little more than an inning against Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>''I think I've had the reputation for being durable and being a guy that goes out there and pitches and does his job,'' Glavine said. ''There's a part of me that doesn't want to let that go. I don't know that one start would do that, but I want to hold on to that as long as I can.''</p>
        <p>Glavine has seen first baseman Mo Vaughn, starter Pedro Astacio and reliever Scott Strickland each try playing through injuries, only to make them worse and jeopardize their seasons and, in Vaughn's case, his career.</p>
        <p>The game itself provided a distraction from the injuries. A home run by Jason Phillips in the fifth inning broke a 1-1 tie, and Floyd led off the seventh with a drive to right. Suzuki leapt at the wall, but the ball sailed over his outstretched glove. Suzuki softly snapped his glove in disappointment when he landed.</p>
        <p>Suzuki said through a translator that he thought he might catch it.</p>
        <p>''I've seen him do it before,'' said Mets Manager Art Howe, who faced the Mariners many times as the manager of the Oakland Athletics. ''Too many times, let's put it that way.''</p>
        <p>Floyd dropped his bat on contact and began jogging as if he knew it was a home run.</p>
        <p>''I thought he had a shot,'' Floyd said of Suzuki. ''I figured I was getting into my trot and hopefully that would make him miss it. With those guys out there in the outfield, you have to crush it.''</p>
        <p>Suzuki slapped the game's first pitch to right for a single, then danced off first base as Mets starter Jae Weong Seo walked the next batter. Suzuki was also issued an intentional walk in the second inning. But Seo dodged both jams, pitched seven innings and was charged with two runs. One run was unearned, after shortstop Joe McEwing let Suzuki's grounder go off his glove in the fourth inning. Another scored after Seo left the game.</p>
        <p>Seo (3-2), an afterthought in spring training who pitched himself into the rotation, now has the lowest earned run average (2.91) of any Mets starter.</p>
