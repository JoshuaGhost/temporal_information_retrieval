        <p>Correction:  June 26, 2003, Thursday  The Votes in Congress chart on Sunday gave incorrect positions in some copies for Senators Jon S. Corzine and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer of New York on a failed Democratic amendment to a bill creating a Medicare prescription drug benefit. They voted yea, not nay. The amendment would have strengthened the federal government's role in delivering the benefit.</p>
