        <p>HATCHING MAGIC</p>
        <p>By Ann Downer.</p>
        <p>Atheneum, $16.95. (Ages 8 to 12)</p>
        <p>''Laughter,'' 11-year-old Theodora Oglethorpe is told, ''is a powerful charm against demons.'' While the charm itself seems to elude the earnest cast of characters in Ann Downer's ''Hatching Magic,'' chuckles do abound in this light, old-world-meets-new-world fantasy.</p>
        <p>The tale opens with Wycca, a 13th-century wyvern (the most desirable dragon ''for the purposes of wizardry''), who slips through a magical hole in her castle's melon patch and arrives in Theodora's 21st-century Cambridge, Mass., pregnant and craving chocolate. Wycca's medieval wizard master, Gideon, goes in search of his runaway pet with a two-headed snake up his sleeve and a purse full of ''biddable fire.'' Sucked headlong through seven centuries, he, too, emerges in the ''strange future'' of ''Boss-town.''</p>
        <p>There, he encounters new forms of magic: ''tamed lightning'' called electricity, ''trained . . . to carry voices along wires and paint moving tapestries on glass''; ''mechanical carts'' that speed murderously through night streets with ''glowing eyes''; and ''devices devoted to the alchemy of turning the raw into the cooked without significant human effort.''</p>
        <p>In his race to find Wycca before the evil Kobold gets to her, Gideon is assisted by the charmingly tweedy Iain Merlin O'Shea, professor emeritus at Harvard. This endearing Merlin is nostalgic for the days when ritual ''fetching'' was a valued art, and laments the decline of the Guild of Adepts in the Wizardly Arts (G.A.W.A.), with its less than adept elected officials and its best wizards ''going freelance.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, motherless Theodora, a wyvern enthusiast spending summer vacation with her nanny (while her zoologist dad is away), gets mixed up in some otherworldly action; spells, curses and a unique tarot card lead to ample madcap magic -- and to tidy resolutions. Ultimately, the novel thrives on humor and cinematically vivid prose. Having honed her skills on the Spellkey trilogy, Downer here employs familiar genre staples, but manages to put a freshly bewitching spin on the Boston we thought we knew.</p>
