        <p>D'Amelio Terras  525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea  Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>There is a curious literalism about certain forms of conceptual art. If Hamish Fulton, for example, says he hiked a certain mileage in the name of art, we have to believe that he really hoofed the whole distance. Cornelia Parker, a London-based artist with a considerable international exhibition record, belongs in that category. This show features an installation of rough balls of mud hanging from the ceiling by strings. This creates a pleasing, low-lying molecular field, but the point is not fully taken if we don't know that the mud was excavated by engineers from beneath the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>

        <p>There is a curious literalism about certain forms of conceptual art. If Hamish Fulton, for example, says he hiked a certain mileage in the name of art, we have to believe that he really hoofed the whole distance. Cornelia Parker, a London-based artist with a considerable international exhibition record, belongs in that category. This show features an installation of rough balls of mud hanging from the ceiling by strings. This creates a pleasing, low-lying molecular field, but the point is not fully taken if we don't know that the mud was excavated by engineers from beneath the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>
        <p>A series of photographs presents miscellaneous antique metal objects, unearthed by scanner-wielding scavengers and bought by Ms. Parker through eBay. Later she buried objects found in the United States at various sites in England and, conversely, buried English objects in American places. You take on faith that the artist actually went to the effort of doing what the captions say she did.</p>
        <p>But what if she didn't? And what if the drips on glass panes, supposedly made of mud taken from Freud's garden, were made of ordinary dirt from Ms. Parker's own garden? What if the framed coil of fine gold wire were just that and not made from the filling of a pulled tooth? Visually, it wouldn't make any difference at all. So the activities of actual displacement and transformation that are so central for the artist remain, at best, only mildly interesting abstract notions for the viewer.</p>
