        <p>Allied forces dropped leaflets last night on the southern city where six British soldiers and four Iraqis died in a gun battle this week, telling residents that the military would return to the city, Majar al Kabir.</p>
        <p>Officials said troops housed at a base nearby might resume patrols in the city by this weekend.</p>
        <p>''We will not return to punish you,'' the leaflets said, according to a translation released by the British, who control the country's southern region. ''That was a tactic of Saddam's regime.''</p>
        <p>They expressed a determination ''to show that the coalition cannot be deflected from its task to help you build a new, free Iraq.''</p>
        <p>The leaflets expressed regret for the deaths, but added, ''It was not an incident of our making.''</p>
        <p>This part of Iraq has been sporadically tense for the British, but the fact that they had to drop leaflets from helicopters indicated how hazardous things have been since heavy gunfire erupted on the city's main street on Tuesday. British paratroopers retreated, and then an angry crowd entered the local police compound and fatally shot six lightly armed members of the Royal Military Police.</p>
        <p>In Majar today, some residents said the British should watch their step if they returned, but others said they would welcome an alternative to the paramilitary group, known as the Fawj Tawara, that controls the town and has members who were trained in Iran.</p>
        <p>''Of course we want them to come back and rebuild our village, the water, electricity and schools,'' Adb Alzhra Jebar, a retired accountant, said of the British.</p>
        <p>The Fawj Tawara is an unpaid militia whose members have been registered by the British forces and who are allowed to carry weapons while on patrol.</p>
        <p>According to a British account given on Thursday, the paratroopers set out on patrol on Tuesday with 18 members of the Fawj Tawara, a British military spokesman said. One team, on foot, was stopped by the commander of the militia, who told them that the crowd was hostile and that the troops should travel in vehicles and not by foot.</p>
        <p>The foot patrol returned and a second team, in vehicles, went up the main street, where it was pelted by rocks, said the spokesman, Capt. Dennis Abbott. The paratroopers fired plastic bullets, hoping to disperse the crowd.</p>
        <p>''They used minimal force,'' the captain said.</p>
        <p>Some city residents support that view, but others describe a scene in which one of the paratroopers pointed a gun at a child after being hit by a tomato, and hit a man who tried to shield the child.</p>
        <p>Captain Abbott said part of the crowd had begun small-arms fire and from another side had come machine-gun fire. Only then, he said, did the British begin shooting.</p>
        <p>He said the militiamen had disappeared as the shooting broke out. The paratroopers radioed for help and attracted a Chinook helicopter, which took fire as well. Eight soldiers in the helicopter were wounded, two seriously. The paratroopers escaped through the fields.</p>
        <p>Some residents of Majar said the crowd believed that the British promised on Monday not to enter the city. City officials and the British said they had agreed only to suspend weapons searches.</p>
        <p>The militia's commander, Abed Salaam, denied that his group had engaged in the patrol. He said on Thursday that members had fled from the police compound, leaving the British military police to face an armed crowd.</p>
        <p>City officials have defended the militiamen against charges that they deserted, saying the crowd was too large to control.</p>
