        <p>Sean Kelly Gallery  528 West 29th Street, Chelsea  Through Thursday</p>
        <p>The romantic title of this show, a reference to the island birthplace of Aphrodite, helps poeticize the artist's lyrical arrangements of rich, gooey layers of lacquer on translucent plexiglass. These abstract paintings are runny mixes of harmonic and discordant pigments -- in pools, splotches, rivulets and streaky terrains. They have a highly edible look, like melting ice creams of many flavors.</p>
        <p>A king-size one, in fact, is actually titled ''Courbet's Dessert'' and is loaded with creamy chocolate hues accented by touches of orange and pistachio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dorner, a former student of the omni-style German painter Gerhard Richter and a well-known exhibitor on the international scene, is said to admire the hues and poetic aspirations of more contemporary artists as well, like Robert Ryman. ''Helmut'' (a self-portrait?), in which large, tranquil floes in several shades of white bask among tiny islands of black and other colors, could also be a tribute to Mr. Ryman's passion for white.</p>
        <p>As if to emphasize his infatuation with impasto, Mr. Dorner sometimes chooses to accompany a larger plexiglass work with a very small, thickly painted canvas that has the surface of a shag rug. One such pairing is ''Castaway'': a typical freeform arrangement in creamy latte colors on white is offset by a miniwork of the same colors, but far more rigidly schematized. Delicate freeform drawings of scribbly, intricately tangled colored lines make a more ethereal contribution. As for the paintings, they are nothing if not appetizing.</p>
