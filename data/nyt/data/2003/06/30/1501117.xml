        <p>Article in Freshman Year series on two new members of Congress: Rep Candice S Miller, Republican who is riding high as party's legislative agenda rolls on, and Rep Raul M Grijalva, liberal Democrat who has been on losing side of a number of votes and is infuriated at way House leaders have limited Democrats' ability to offer amendments to legislation and debate their own ideas on House floor; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Candice S. Miller was riding high last week, flush with the glow of being a freshman Republican in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, she dipped into Washington's famous pork barrel, when the House approved a military construction bill that included $9.6 million for a new health care center at a base in her Macomb County, Mich., district. Next, in the wee hours of the morning on Friday, her party squeaked out a one-vote victory on the Medicare prescription drug benefit bill.</p>

        <p>Candice S. Miller was riding high last week, flush with the glow of being a freshman Republican in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, she dipped into Washington's famous pork barrel, when the House approved a military construction bill that included $9.6 million for a new health care center at a base in her Macomb County, Mich., district. Next, in the wee hours of the morning on Friday, her party squeaked out a one-vote victory on the Medicare prescription drug benefit bill.</p>
        <p>Then Representative Miller jetted off to Rome, to spend the early part of her July 4 recess talking with European leaders about hydrogen fuel and bioengineered foods as part of her first ''Codel'' -- a taxpayer-financed trip abroad by a Congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>''I feel very optimistic,'' she said shortly before she left.</p>
        <p>Optimistic is not exactly the word one would use to describe Ra√∫l M. Grijalva these days. Resigned is more like it. Representative Grijalva, a freshman Democrat from Tucson, voted against the prescription drug bill, just as he voted against the repeal of the estate tax and every other piece of legislation Republicans have pushed through this year. For the July 4 recess, he is going home to Tucson, where he expects to tell constituents, ''We're putting up a fight.''</p>
        <p>For Mrs. Miller, a self-described ''George W. Bush Republican'' from a middle-class neighborhood outside Detroit, and Mr. Grijalva, an unabashed liberal from one of the poorest corners of Tucson, the last week was not much different than any other since they joined Congress in January. These lawmakers, whose first year is being chronicled by The New York Times, represent a microcosm of life in the House, where the political reality these days is stark and simple: Republicans win and Democrats lose.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Senate, where bipartisan compromise is necessary because 60 votes are often required for the most contentious legislation to pass, the House is run under the tight leadership of Republicans, who in most cases need only a simple majority to win. The House leaders frequently use procedural gimmicks to ensure victory, limiting Democrats' ability to offer amendments to legislation and debate their own ideas on the floor of the House.</p>
        <p>The tactics infuriate Mr. Grijalva, who is chafing under the restrictions. A former county official from Tucson, he has made a political career out of fighting for the underdog. In December, shortly after his election, he told supporters at a rally that he expected to be on the losing end most of the time. What he did not expect, he says now, was to feel as though he is living inside some kind of a Republican-run prison.</p>
        <p>''We're not getting our fair chance,'' he said recently, echoing the sentiments of his party's leaders. ''I think as Republicans ratchet down their control of the House, it is becoming more difficult.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Miller, for her part, thinks Democrats -- who controlled the House for 40 years before Republicans took over in 1994 -- are simply getting a taste of their own medicine. She has often said she came to Congress to enact ''the people's agenda,'' and the way she sees it, her leaders are simply doing what they must.</p>
        <p>''When you're in the majority,'' she said, ''be bold, and don't be afraid to govern.''</p>
        <p>One result, though, is that there is a strong partisan divide in the House, particularly among freshmen, who are still feeling their way and unwilling to strain the bonds of party loyalty. Mrs. Miller and Mr. Grijalva say they have little contact with members from the opposite party, other than to exchange workplace pleasantries.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of cordiality -- how are you, how's the family,'' Mr. Grijalva said. ''But getting into in-depth discussion about issues, different points of view? No.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Grijalva tries to remain cheery and takes comfort in what small victories there are. Recently, he has been pressing Congress to amend an education bill by increasing Head Start financing for children of migrant workers -- an issue that is dear to Mr. Grijalva, whose late father, a Mexican immigrant, once worked as a ranch hand.</p>
        <p>His first step was to take the amendment before a subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, on which he serves. The vote was 9 to 9, a victory in Mr. Grijalva's view, considering that he expected the amendment to be rejected outright. Still, he lost when it came before the full committee, as he knew he would.</p>
        <p>''It's frustrating,'' he said, even before the panel's 25-20 vote, which, like so much else in the House, broke along party lines. ''But I also believe in this weird adage, that sometimes you have to lose to win.''</p>
        <p>By that, Mr. Grijalva meant that the committee vote was only the first step. Already, he is preparing for the next one. In his office, there is a large picture of a dark-skinned boy, not more than 3 years old and clad only in a diaper, standing in a blueberry field alongside a man who is presumably his father. An aide had the photograph, taken recently in North Carolina, blown up by the House graphics office. Mr. Grijalva intends to take the picture with him when the Head Start bill comes up for debate on the House floor.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Miller, for her part, has been pleasantly surprised by life in the House. Before being elected to Congress, she spent eight years as Michigan's secretary of state, a job in which she supervised thousands of employees and frequently made executive decisions.</p>
        <p>''People always said, 'Congress moves at glacial speed, you're going to be frustrated,' '' Mrs. Miller said. Then, ticking off a string of Republican victories, on everything from President Bush's tax cuts to legislation that would exempt certain small businesses from state laws regarding health insurance, she added, ''That has not been my experience at all.''</p>
        <p>Articles in this series will periodically observe two Congressional newcomers as they take on their new roles.</p>
