        <p>In 490 B.C., Athenians staged a mighty victory over the Persians here, to save their civilization. Once again, Athenians may be winning a major skirmish along this coast. But there is no certainty they will win their bigger battle, which is against time itself.</p>
        <p>In Greece, time is a formidable opponent, both forward and backward. In many places where contractors excavate for the Summer Games -- now less than 14 months away -- they uncover more treasures from the past.</p>
        <p>''Every time we dig, a piece of history is laughing in our faces, saying: 'I'm here! What are you going to do with me?''' said Gianna Angelopoulos-Daskalaki, the president of the Athens organizing committee for the 2004 Olympics.</p>
        <p>While digging the new subway line, builders kept discovering remains of ancient civilizations. Just in case the workers might have been inclined to pulverize the ancient pots, drains and roadways, a government archaeologist was looking over their shoulders. Now some of the artifacts are displayed in the museumlike mezzanine of the handsome Syntagma Square station.</p>
        <p>That same diligence has been followed out here on the marshlands at the Schinias Center, where the rowing and kayaking events will be held in August of next year. Yes, at the very least, there will be rowing and kayaking. One can already stand on the banks of the handsome manufactured lake and see the lane markers, in place for test races in two months.</p>
        <p>Whether the new roads will be carved and paved from the current rubble in time for the 2004 Summer Games is another question. The future flexes its muscles, while the past imposes its own demands.</p>
        <p>The Athenians struggle mightily to catch up after three lost years from 1997 to 2000 because of repeated delays. They have pledged to build all these Olympic edifices to satisfy the demands made upon any Olympic host.</p>
        <p>Let's face it: the Olympics are a worldwide shell game, based on finding a new eager city-host every two years in order to entertain billions of television viewers and also sell the sponsors' products. Sporadic American infatuation with the Olympics creates a market for these periodic communal follies. Even some New York boosters are daydreaming about throwing a brief, expensive party in 2012.</p>
        <p>The hopeful Athenians now labor in brutal heat and humidity. Soon enough, they will pay the bills for their dreams and their ambitions. Later, they will fret what to do with buildings they no longer need. But right now they dig, and they uncover evidence of their glorious past.</p>
        <p>Somewhere right around here, Miltiades, the Athenian general, staged a brilliant flanking maneuver that defeated the larger forces of Darius of Persia.</p>
        <p>According to legend, one Athenian soldier, in full battle gear, ran the 26 miles 385 yards from the battlefield to central Athens to deliver the news of salvation before he died of exhaustion.</p>
        <p>The name of the battle gave birth to the Olympic event, the marathon, which next year will begin at a local soccer field and follow the coastal route of that gallant, doomed messenger. The remains of the 192 Athenians who died in the Battle of Marathon were uncovered in a mass burial ground only in 1970, a few miles down the coast.</p>
        <p>Other remains at Marathon are more prosaic. A municipal airport, condemned in order to build the rowing and kayaking site, unearthed pollution. And as workers dug the lake (filled by natural spring water from the hills above it), they discovered ancient dwellings, going back millennia before Miltiades and Darius. The Archaeological Society of Athens has rescued these heirlooms.</p>
        <p>There is a positive side to all this digging: the wetlands have been reclaimed. Birds and fish are returning to the area. The thick pine grove along the sea is being nourished by the fresh water.</p>
        <p>Other antiquities have been unearthed. At the athletes' village, a portion of an aqueduct, built by Hadrian of Rome, was discovered. At the Markopoulo equestrian center, a rare statue of the goddess Aphrodite was found.</p>
        <p>And one of the great troves was deep below the center of downtown Athens, at Syntagma Square, home of the Greek parliament, where subway workers kept uncovering relics. ''Every time something was found, it was an obligation to stop,'' said Vassilis Krelios, the operations manager at the station. ''But, usually, the workers would go to another area.''</p>
        <p>The archaeologists rescued many artifacts for the city's museums, many of which are now closed as Athens becomes a dusty and uncomfortable construction site.</p>
        <p>But the Metro line from Dafni to Sepolia (say those beautiful names over and over: ''Dafni and Sepolia'') has been completed -- a glorious, clean, quiet, tasteful and modern mixture of art and technology.</p>
        <p>One escalator level below ground, glass cases display human remains going back to the fourth century B.C., as well as clay water and sewer pipes from bathhouses and vases, beads and bronze jewelry from the 11th century B.C. And there are three-dimensional displays of 20 levels of roadway going back seven centuries.</p>
        <p>''They found them here,'' said Dimitris Fotinos of Athens, a student of electrical engineering, who was gazing at the displays last week. ''It's better to leave them here.''</p>
        <p>In the nearby Acropolis station, there is a copy of the famous marble frieze ''taken'' from the Parthenon early in the 19th century by Lord Elgin and still ensconced in the British Museum. A large mural depicts the actress and public official Melina Mercouri, who devoted her final years to lobbying for the return of the Elgin Marbles.</p>
        <p>There is a great deal of history in Athens. One can only hope, for these earnest people, that the next verdict of history will be kind.</p>
