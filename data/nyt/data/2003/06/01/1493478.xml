        <p>Fidelity Investments plans to start the first exchange-traded fund that tracks the Nasdaq composite stock index.</p>
        <p>The venture is the first exchange-traded fund of any type for Fidelity, said James Griffin, a spokesman for the company.</p>
        <p>Unlike traditional mutual funds, exchange-traded funds are traded and priced continuously, in much the same way as shares of ordinary stock. Mutual funds are traded and priced at the end of the day.</p>
        <p>In filings on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fidelity said it also intended to open a traditional mutual fund that will track the Nasdaq composite, which contains about 3,600 stocks. Operation of the two funds depends upon S.E.C. approval. Mr. Griffin said Fidelity, the nation's biggest mutual fund company, hoped to start them in the second half of the year.</p>
        <p>An exchange-traded fund based on the narrower Nasdaq 100 index, which comprises 100 of the largest nonfinancial companies traded on the Nasdaq market, has operated since March 1999. Known as the QQQ, after its ticker symbol, it became wildly popular during the Internet boom as a means of trading technology stocks. It is run by the Nasdaq. As of Thursday, there were 692.5 million shares of the QQQ outstanding, with a total market capitalization of about $20.3 billion, according to Bloomberg Financial Services.</p>
        <p>Mr. Griffin said Fidelity was ''not speculating on how widely'' its new funds would be used. The exchange-traded fund will hold shares of 1,200 to 1,300 Nasdaq stocks, while the mutual fund will hold about 1,500 stocks. In both cases, shares will be selected to mathematically model the broader index. Jacques P. Perold, who runs Fidelity's six existing index funds, will manage the new funds, Mr. Griffin said.</p>
