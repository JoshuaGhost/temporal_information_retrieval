        <p>Ms. Elkon, 35, is keeping her name. She was until February the chief of staff and the director of communications for the 9/11 United Services Group, an organization in New York that coordinates long-term assistance by 13 charities for victims of the September 11 attacks and their families. She was a special assistant and deputy director of scheduling to President Clinton from 1995 to 1997 and then was the director of planning until 1999 for the National Security Council.

Her mother is a consultant for the retail clothing and manufacturing industry in New York and is the president of the board of Business and Industry for the Arts in Education, an organization in New York that sponsors literacy programs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolin, 41, is an executive vice president and the general counsel at the Hartford Financial Services Group, the insurance and financial services business in Hartford.
