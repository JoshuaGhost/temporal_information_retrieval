      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>IN FEBRUARY, the editors of The Times Magazine, reviving an old tradition, invited high-school students across America to submit their original writing or photography for publication. The challenge behind the contest was to follow two formats seen in each week's edition of the magazine: a personal essay in the model of the Lives column or an image with accompanying text of the kind seen in the What They Were Thinking feature.</p>
        <p>We received more than 4,000 submissions - some 3,000 essays and 1,000 photographs - from students all across the country. Some of the entries came from individual students; many others came through schools or through writing or photography classes. (One high school submitted more than 40 entries.) When the mailbags had all been delivered and the envelopes opened, we sifted through the huge piles. After a long process and much debate, the editors selected one winner and two runners-up in each category.</p>

        <p>IN FEBRUARY, the editors of The Times Magazine, reviving an old tradition, invited high-school students across America to submit their original writing or photography for publication. The challenge behind the contest was to follow two formats seen in each week's edition of the magazine: a personal essay in the model of the Lives column or an image with accompanying text of the kind seen in the What They Were Thinking feature.</p>
        <p>We received more than 4,000 submissions - some 3,000 essays and 1,000 photographs - from students all across the country. Some of the entries came from individual students; many others came through schools or through writing or photography classes. (One high school submitted more than 40 entries.) When the mailbags had all been delivered and the envelopes opened, we sifted through the huge piles. After a long process and much debate, the editors selected one winner and two runners-up in each category.</p>
        <p>The submissions reflected an array of perspectives and experiences, from novices and polished talents alike. Among the submissions that most captivated us, some were distinguished by literary craft or technical merit; others, by an interesting story or searing image. But overall, we responded to the essays and photographs as any reader of the magazine would: we looked for works that moved us, that stayed with us, that made us feel we had caught a glimpse of the minds that created them. The finalists, like the contestants themselves, were predominantly female; three were in 12th grade and three were in 11th. The two first-prize winners were Ashley Marie Rhodes-Courter, whose powerful essay describes the moment that her torturous path through foster care ended and her life with her new family began, and Allison Roberts, whose moody photograph of a fifth-grade girl so vividly captures the toughness and vulnerability of early adolescence. Each winner receives $1,000, and the photographer also receives an Olympus camera; their work, as well as that of the four runners-up, appears in the following pages. We congratulate them and thank all those who allowed their work to be considered.</p>
