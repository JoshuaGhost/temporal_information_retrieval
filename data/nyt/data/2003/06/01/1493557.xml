        <p>RUSS EBERSOL keeps In Too Deep, his 25-foot Sea Ray powerboat, at the Wright Island Marina in New Rochelle during the winter months. The Mount Vernon resident is lucky to have one of the 140 slips, because he says there are waiting lists at many of the Westchester County marinas.</p>
        <p>''I get calls every day, and I turn down people every day,'' said LeRoy Marriott, operations manager at the Wright Island Marina. ''Marinas are closing in City Island because they're building condos there. There are no slips.''</p>

        <p>RUSS EBERSOL keeps In Too Deep, his 25-foot Sea Ray powerboat, at the Wright Island Marina in New Rochelle during the winter months. The Mount Vernon resident is lucky to have one of the 140 slips, because he says there are waiting lists at many of the Westchester County marinas.</p>
        <p>''I get calls every day, and I turn down people every day,'' said LeRoy Marriott, operations manager at the Wright Island Marina. ''Marinas are closing in City Island because they're building condos there. There are no slips.''</p>
        <p>From 1993 to 2003, the estimated number of recreational boats grew to 17,353,400 from 16,212,000, according to the National Marine Manufacturers Association, and New York ranks seventh nationally in boating registration.</p>
        <p>''In the past couple of years, especially since 9/11, more families have bought boats to spend quality time together,'' said Lenny Caro, owner of Boat World USA at the Wright Island Marina. ''We've probably jumped up a good 75 to 80 percent in the past two years.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Caro uses the annual Boat Show, held at the Jacob Javits Center in Manhattan, as a barometer of the popularity of boating. In January 2001, Boat World sold 120 Sea Rays, a popular cruising powerboat, which Mr. Caro calls ''the Cadillac of boats.'' In January 2002, nearly 207 were sold, with prices ranging from $25,000 to $75,000 and higher.</p>
        <p>''There is no profile of a typical boat owner,'' Mr. Marriott said. ''I can show you Scotch connoisseurs to maintenance workers and they have their boats right next to each other. A few guys here are millionaires, and their boats are next to landscapers'. A $10,000 boat can be sitting next to a $500,000 boat and everybody is equal on the boat dock.''</p>
        <p>The boating season begins at the end of April and continues through mid-October. Storage expenses can cost more than $100 a foot in the summer high season to $45 a foot for winter storage, when boats are often shrink-wrapped and dry-docked. The costs associated with owning a boat can add up, which is how Mr. Ebersol came up with the name In Too Deep.</p>
        <p>Boat names are deeply personal, according to Johanna Giacobbe, owner of Imperial Yacht Club on Davenport Avenue in New Rochelle. Owners name them after their children, Disney characters, their business or how they made their money. Dr. Don McNicol of Rye, a specialist in pulmonary and critical care, named his fishing boat Code Blue, a hospital term for cardiac arrest. Jerry Salpeter of Ossining named his 37-foot Silverton ''KNO3,'' the chemical formula for potassium nitrate or saltpeter, a rumored anaphrodisiac.</p>
        <p>The Great Lakes, a brand-new 26-foot Sea Ray, is Daniel Lake's third boat since 1973.</p>
        <p>''Instead of buying a summer home, this is my summer home,'' said Mr. Lake, 41, who lives in New Rochelle. ''It's like a mortgage with a lot of equity. It's also got good resale.''</p>
        <p>''No Patience,'' a 40-foot Sea Ray, has a caduceus under its name, which provides a hint as to the profession of the owner. Nearly five years ago, Dr. William Bisordi retired from his practice as a gastroenterologist.</p>
        <p>''I've had probably eight or so boats since I started boating,'' Dr. Bisordi, 55, said. ''We've had all different names, but when I retired from active practice, my wife thought this was a good idea. It's also reflective of my having no patience.''</p>
        <p>He and his wife, Deborah, used to enjoy boating as a family, taking their children to Florida and Nantucket.</p>
        <p>''If you have a family, when the kids are in their early teens, it's wonderful,'' he said. ''It's a real good family thing. They're trapped with you on the boat.''</p>
        <p>Jim Quaranto bought his 25-foot Maxum Suncruiser in 1999. Four years old at the time of purchase and in mint condition, it is Mr. Quaranto's first boat.</p>
        <p>''When you name a boat, you try to come up with something clever, and I was trying to find something that had to do with music because I'm a musician and a teacher,'' Mr. Quaranto, 45, said. ''I had seen a boat named All That Jazz, so I was wracking my brain and picked Jazz It Up, to mean 'let's get going or let's get out of here.'''</p>
        <p>Kevin dePicciotto bought Pipe Dream, his 34-foot Silverton Express Cruiser from a plumber three years ago, and never changed the name. There is a superstition among boat owners that it is bad luck to change the name of a boat, and he didn't want to suffer any consequences.</p>
        <p>''The name of the boat was supposed to be Pickin' Up,'' because I'm a garage man,'' said Mr. dePicciotto, who works for IESI Corporation, a private waste-removal and recycling company in Manhattan. ''But I took a liking to Pipe Dream and left it alone.''</p>
        <p>Born in Florida and raised around boats, Mr. dePicciotto, 30, of Yonkers, has always had a passion for boats, saving up enough money to buy his first one at age 19. Pipe Dream is his third boat.</p>
        <p>On most Friday nights Mr. dePicciotto takes Pipe Dream to the Sandbar in Jersey City, a nightclub and restaurant.</p>
        <p>''A group of our friends bring the boat, dock it at the place and we go in, hang out and dance,'' he said. ''On Sunday, we'll go out and just anchor, bring jet skis, and barbecue on the boat.''</p>
        <p>The start of the boating season was delayed this year because of unseasonably cold weather, which prevented the application of bottom paint to the boats before launching. Now boat owners are even more anxious to get out on the water.</p>
        <p>''Westchester is a fabulous place to go boating, because Long Island Sound is a spectacular body of water, with an interesting coastline and lots of little harbors, both on the North Shore and the Long Island side,'' said Doug McKeige, who kept his 35-foot powerboat, White Wing, dry-docked at Wright Island. ''And it's a relatively safe, protected body of water because it's not exposed to ocean waves.''</p>
        <p>He smiled. ''Don't get the word out, because we're very happy out there all by ourselves,'' he said.</p>
