        <p>ANIMAL SENSE. By Diane Ackerman. Illustrated by Peter SÃ­s. Knopf. $14.95. (Ages 6 and up) A charming collection of poems about the senses in which, for example, touch is a verse about how an alligator finds the perfect spot ''not too cold and not too hot,'' vision is about how a bee sees, and the impala's way of signaling danger introduces smell. The accompanying illustrations are delicate and whimsical.</p>
        <p>THE QUESTION SONG. Written and illustrated by Kaethe Zemach. Megan Tingley/Little, Brown. $16.95. (Ages 4 to 8) If only life's problems were as easily resolved as in this optimistic story in which crises like broken trains, skinned knees and lost bunnies are solved by children and parents singing a question song about what to do. Sweetly told and a technique worth trying. Why not?</p>
        <p>IN MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE. Award-Winning Authors Tell Stories About Their Grandmothers. Compiled and illustrated by Bonnie Christensen. HarperCollins. $18.99. (Ages 8 to 12) A dozen women writers -- some, like Jean Craighead George and Beverly Cleary, now elderly and eminent; some, like Alma Flor Ada, Minfong Ho and Beverley Naidoo, raised in other countries; others, including Joan Abelove, Pat Cummings and Gail Carson Levine, American baby boomers -- all reflect on their grandmothers with surprising toughness and genuine affection.</p>
        <p>THE CANINE CONNECTION: Stories About Dogs and People. By Betsy Hearne. Margaret K. McElderry. $15.95. (Ages 10 to 14) A dozen short and accessible stories about different kinds of human relationships with dogs. Nice for summer reading.</p>
        <p>THE SECOND SUMMER OF THE SISTERHOOD. By Ann Brashares. Delacorte. $15.95. (Ages 12 and up) Those pants, the lucky pair four friends shared so successfully one summer, are back. The sequel finds Bridget, Carmen, Tibby and Lena on the move. Light and romantic.</p>
