        <p>Nets president Rod Thorn and Coach Byron Scott have transformed New Jersey from a desperate franchise into a championship contender.</p>

        <p>Jerry West takes no credit for bringing two of his favorite people together. West, the omnipresent symbol of the N.B.A., offered encouragement and, typically, spoke honestly.</p>
        <p>When Rod Thorn, his close friend from West Virginia, called as he weighed leaving his job as senior vice president of the N.B.A. for the Nets, West told Thorn it was time.</p>
        <p>Sixteen years had passed since Thorn drafted Michael Jordan as general manager of the Chicago Bulls. Thorn had built his reputation as the personable disciplinarian of the N.B.A. for 14 years. But he needed to compete again.</p>
        <p>When Thorn became the Nets' president in the late spring of 2000, he needed to hire a coach, and he called West for a profile of Byron Scott, Thorn's top candidate. Scott, too, placed a call to West about Thorn.</p>
        <p>As the Lakers' general manager, West had traded Norm Nixon and Eddie Jordan to the San Diego Clippers for Scott, a shooting guard who was the No. 4 draft pick in 1983. The trade was highly unpopular, but West respected Scott for overcoming the harsh treatment from fans and teammates. Three championship rings later, Scott helped vindicate him.</p>
        <p>And now Scott's Nets are making their second straight trip to the N.B.A. finals, which begin Wednesday in San Antonio.</p>
        <p>West, 65, said he never thought Scott would become a coach. ''To be candid, it was something I never dreamed possible,'' West said.</p>
        <p>Despite expressing little interest in the profession as a player, Scott, 42, said he went into coaching because he was not finished winning. At 62, neither is Thorn.</p>
        <p>With disparate competitive temperaments -- Thorn is as volcanic as Scott is placid -- the two joined a franchise desperate for the winning attitude they brought from their previous jobs.</p>
        <p>''What I always admired in him,'' Thorn said of Scott, ''even in the first year when we weren't very good, was there was a calmness and an equanimity in him. He never gave up. The glass was always half full. He always expected to have success. He's one of those guys who always had it. He's got a way about him. He expects to be successful; there's something to be said about that.''</p>
        <p>The Nets' record may speak for itself, but their success has many voices and themes: Thorn's and Scott's mutual loyalty, the elder's counsel to his young coach, the trust they have in their assistants and, most notably, Jason Kidd's talent to lead his teammates. ''I'm not going to sit here and say I'm the reason that we got into the finals the last two years,'' Scott said. ''It's a collective thing with a bunch of people involved, from Jason to Rod Thorn.''</p>
        <p>In June 2000, Scott had 14 years of playing experience but just two years of experience as an assistant coach in Sacramento. ''He was like a canvas when he came here,'' Thorn said.</p>
        <p>Scott has developed some nontraditional coaching methods. He does not log the longest office hours. He has delegated authority to his assistants, especially his top assistant, Eddie Jordan, whom Thorn had also interviewed for the head coaching job.</p>
        <p>Scott did not openly involve his assistant coaches in his first season. The Nets limped to 26 victories as he alienated some players by criticizing them through the news media. Scott realized he had to loosen his grip.</p>
        <p>When Kidd arrived last season, Jordan installed the Princeton offense, which he had learned working as an assistant to Pete Carril in Sacramento. Players describe Jordan as the X's and O's coach. He is also in charge of pregame strategy, and Scott approved of his placing spirit cards in players' lockers and delivering motivational speeches.</p>
        <p>It was Jordan's speech before Game 1 of this year's playoffs that helped stir the players out of their regular-season malaise. The Nets finished with 49 victories, second in the Eastern Conference to the Detroit Pistons, but were 15-18 after the All-Star Game break. They have been almost unbeatable in the playoffs, winning 10 consecutive games and 12 of 14.</p>
        <p>''I give Byron and his guys credit for getting across the urgency that we needed to play with,'' Thorn said. ''It would not have surprised me to see us get knocked out in the first round. I thought we drew a very tough opponent in Milwaukee.''</p>
        <p>Thorn sees Jordan's pregame speech as a testament to Scott's self-confidence.</p>
        <p>''As I like to say, it's whether you get it done or not that counts,'' Thorn said. ''It's not necessarily how you get it done. Some people want to control everything. Some people who delegate responsibility are very successful, and some who do it aren't. It depends on who you're delegating to.''</p>
        <p>Thorn remembers his and Scott's first season with the Nets. ''It was trying for all of us, and I'm not the easiest guy in the world to be around when things aren't going well,'' Thorn said.</p>
        <p>Since then, Scott has gotten into trouble mostly when he has unintentionally made headlines. His off-the-cuff disparaging remarks about the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell drew admonishment from Thorn. ''He talks to me about certain things, and he jumps on me for certain things,'' Scott said of Thorn. '' 'Coach, you can't do that!' he says. He's like a father figure to me.''</p>
        <p>Scott's words have been heard in Memphis, where West is rebuilding the Grizzlies. ''He's just a good guy, fun to be around,'' West said. ''But sometimes he says things where I wish I could put a roll of tape around his mouth.''</p>
        <p>Scott is unabashed about his methods. He lists his former coaches, Pat Riley with the Lakers and Larry Brown with Indiana, as mentors, though does not follow their strict practices.</p>
        <p>''There are some coaches in this league that watch tape 15, 16 hours a day,'' said Scott, who watches tape at home only during the playoffs. ''That doesn't make them a good coach. That makes them more prepared than a lot of coaches. If I would measure it in hours, there's a bunch of coaches that put in more time than I do.''</p>
        <p>Scott said he plays golf during the season and routinely goes to the movies with his wife, Anita, on the nights before home games. He drives his two children, LonDen and DaRon, to school every morning before going to practice.</p>
        <p>''I need outlets,'' he said. ''I can't do this job 24-7. If I did, I would burn myself out. I need golf, I need my family. I really do. I need other things that are just as important to me as basketball.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps that perspective is what makes Scott so calm. The last time he panicked? ''When my son didn't come home from the prom,'' Scott said.</p>
        <p>Scott describes himself as a player's coach, though at times this season some have complained about his lack of communication about their roles. During games, he stands on the sideline, arms folded, staring intently; he does not linger in the huddle or furiously diagram plays.</p>
        <p>''His real strength is his optimism,'' guard Kerry Kittles said. ''He just keeps a positive attitude no matter how we're playing. He's just, 'Hey, I think you guys are the best team in the East and the best team in the league.'</p>
        <p>''His confidence in himself and the things he accomplished when he was playing kind of rubs off. It's sweet.''</p>
        <p>Kidd said that Scott has grown as a coach. ''To be in his third year, thrown into a team that has gone to the finals twice -- for a young coach, that's not easy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When the team slumped after the All-Star Game break, Thorn said he never considered making a change. He looked at the bigger picture, and did not feel that Scott had lost control of the team. ''At this stage in my career, I'm not a panic type of guy,'' Thorn said. ''You got to know what you got.''</p>
        <p>What the Nets have is a record playoff streak, even if change may be imminent. The Philadelphia 76ers have asked to interview Jordan about their coaching vacancy.</p>
        <p>''His assistant title is probably not for long,'' said Kidd, who lobbied for Jordan to stay after last season and who will be a free agent this summer. ''It will be hard to see because I think the two of them work extremely well together.''</p>
        <p>Scott has one year left on his contract. If an extension is a vote of confidence, Scott has not received one yet. ''He's done a good job,'' Thorn said. ''After the season, we'll have to talk, as we will talk about Jason Kidd and other issues that we have.''</p>
        <p>One other issue is the possible departure of Ed Stefanski, the Nets' scouting director, who is a candidate for management jobs with other teams. Thorn said he depends on Stefanski, who pushed to select Kenyon Martin with the No. 1 pick in 2000 and who was instrumental in trading the No. 7 pick in 2001 to Houston for three picks: Richard Jefferson, Jason Collins and Brandon Armstrong.</p>
        <p>''You never want to lose good people,'' said Thorn, who has two years left on his contract. But if Stefanski or Jordan were to leave, Thorn said: ''The team will go on. We've got some good building blocks in place.''</p>
        <p>Thorn, who won an American Basketball Association title as an assistant coach of the 1973-74 New York Nets, hopes his role in reforming the franchise will be the legacy from his second tour.</p>
        <p>And Scott's legacy? ''I think I would like them to say that he's a winner; at every level he won,'' Scott said. ''That's what I think about, because nothing else is important.''</p>
