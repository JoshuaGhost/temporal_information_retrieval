        <p>Five Israeli Arabs were charged today with funneling an estimated $10 million to the Islamic group Hamas, marking a rare instance in which leading Israeli Arabs have been accused of links to militant Palestinian movements.</p>
        <p>The five were not charged with direct involvement in terrorism. The money was allegedly passed out by charities linked to Hamas, and much of it went to Palestinian families with relatives who were in prison or who had been killed in violence. Families of suicide bombers also received money, according to prosecutors.</p>

        <p>Five Israeli Arabs were charged today with funneling an estimated $10 million to the Islamic group Hamas, marking a rare instance in which leading Israeli Arabs have been accused of links to militant Palestinian movements.</p>
        <p>The five were not charged with direct involvement in terrorism. The money was allegedly passed out by charities linked to Hamas, and much of it went to Palestinian families with relatives who were in prison or who had been killed in violence. Families of suicide bombers also received money, according to prosecutors.</p>
        <p>The arrest of the men last month has contributed to the friction between Israel's Jews and Arabs.</p>
        <p>For some Israeli Jews, it suggests that Arabs in Israel are actively aiding Palestinians in their uprising. For many Israeli Arabs, the prosecutions have fueled old resentments.</p>
        <p>The session today at the District Court in Haifa drew Israeli Arab protesters to the streets. Inside the courtroom, one of the accused, Sheik Raed Salah, told reporters that the case was ''meant to silence all of the Arab sector.''</p>
        <p>Israeli Arabs are sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, but with few exceptions they have not been involved in the conflict with Israel.</p>
        <p>The accused include Suleiman Agbariyeh, the mayor of Umm al Fahm, one of the largest Arab towns in Israel, and Sheik Salah, the fiery leader of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement, the largest Muslim group in Israel.</p>
        <p>Four of the men were charged with ''belonging to a terrorist organization,'' ''contacts with foreign agents'' and ''plotting criminal acts.'' Mr. Agbariyeh faces only the last two charges.</p>
        <p>The defendants raised millions of dollars in the United States, Europe and many Muslim countries for an Islamic charity called the Institute for Humanitarian Aid, which channeled the money to groups linked to Hamas, according to prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Hamas has carried out more suicide bombings than any other Palestinian faction, and its stated goal is the destruction of Israel. The group also has an extensive network of schools, health clinics and welfare groups that aid Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Sheik Salah and Hamas have denied any formal ties.</p>
        <p>Sheik Salah and one of his aides were also accused of having contacts with Nabil Mahzomah, described by Israel as ''an agent for the Iranian intelligence services.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mahzomah, an Israeli Arab who was convicted of terrorism in Israel, was sent to Lebanon in a prisoner exchange in the mid-1980's. He works with Iranian and Lebanese intelligence and with Israeli Arabs and Palestinians, according to the prime minister's office.</p>
