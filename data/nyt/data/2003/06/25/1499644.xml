        <p>Argentina and the International Monetary Fund agreed today to begin negotiating a multiyear agreement that will force the new government here to make politically unpopular decisions the country has been avoiding for nearly two years.</p>
        <p>''This is a new stage that is beginning,'' Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna said this afternoon at a joint news conference with the fund's managing director, Horst Köhler.

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Argentina and the International Monetary Fund agreed today to begin negotiating a multiyear agreement that will force the new government here to make politically unpopular decisions the country has been avoiding for nearly two years.</p>
        <p>''This is a new stage that is beginning,'' Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna said this afternoon at a joint news conference with the fund's managing director, Horst Köhler. For his part, Mr. Köhler said he favored a three-year accord that would allow Argentina to become ''a reliable, normal partner'' after having declared the largest sovereign debt default in history 18 months ago.</p>
        <p>During his two-day visit here, Mr. Kohler met twice with Argentina's new president, Néstor Kirchner, a Peronist who took office on May 25. Argentine officials said today that Mr. Kirchner had criticized the fund on Monday night, but this afternoon Mr. Köhler expressed his support for Mr. Kirchner.</p>
        <p>''He has obviously a vision,'' Mr. Köhler said of the country's new leader, who has repeatedly said the growth of the Argentine economy takes precedence over satisfying the fund or foreign creditors. ''I do think this vision should be implemented and that it will lead this country to strong growth and social cohesion.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Köhler added that any agreement with the I.M.F. would necessarily involve ''a need to deepen and broaden the process of structural reform.''</p>
        <p>That would presumably include some combination of spending cuts and higher taxes, revised revenue-sharing with provinces and reorganizing a financial sector left in ruins by the economic collapse.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mr. Köhler offered an apology of sorts for having misread the nature of the crisis here and the best way to solve it. Early last year, for example, fund officials warned that the Argentine government's policies would most likely lead to severe inflation and a further deterioration of the economy, neither of which occurred.</p>
        <p>''I have come here to Argentina to admit that the I.M.F. may have underestimated the recovery of this economy,'' Mr. Köhler said. He added: ''I commend the minister for his persistence during these last months.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Köhler was referring to the fact that even without I.M.F. support, the Argentine economy has begun to recover. During the first quarter of this year, the economy expanded by 5.4 percent, in contrast to a contraction of more than 10 percent last year.</p>
        <p>But when asked if his remarks constituted a mea culpa for policies that worsened the situation here, Mr. Köhler replied that ''the core problems of this country lie in Argentina itself.'' But he added: ''What I can say and do say with conviction is that it is clear that also the I.M.F. has reason to review its policy and its approach to Argentina so as to draw lessons out of experience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavagna acknowledged that there had been signs in recent weeks that the recovery was slowing. Businesses have found their ability to produce and export constrained by their inability to obtain credit, which has all but dried up because of the debt default and the ensuing economic uncertainty.</p>
        <p>To alleviate that problem, Mr. Köhler urged the new government to resolve its problems with creditors here and abroad, who are owed $102.7 billion. But, he said, the monetary fund would not be directly involved in that process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lavagna predicted the debt renegotiation process would be long and arduous, since it involved 150 types of bonds issued by eight separate jurisdictions to thousands of creditors. Nevertheless, he said, Argentina ''could have some kind of a serious proposal by the end of September,'' when the fund is scheduled to hold its annual meeting, in Dubai.</p>
