        <p>The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund plans to announce the creation of a new summer jobs program today for low-income youths.</p>
        <p>Officials with the fund, which provides money to seven charities that help New Yorkers in need, said they planned to donate $1.4 million -- about 5 percent of the fund's endowment -- to create 1,000 jobs in communities in all five boroughs.

        <p>The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund plans to announce the creation of a new summer jobs program today for low-income youths.</p>
        <p>Officials with the fund, which provides money to seven charities that help New Yorkers in need, said they planned to donate $1.4 million -- about 5 percent of the fund's endowment -- to create 1,000 jobs in communities in all five boroughs. The employees, who are expected to range from 14 to 18 years old, will work six hours a day, four days a week, at the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, with the fifth weekday devoted to classes in career development and college preparedness.</p>
        <p>''These really are poor kids for whom the money is desperately needed,'' said Jack Rosenthal, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund. ''In some cases, the money is needed to keep the family afloat.''</p>
        <p>Over the last several weeks, Mr. Rosenthal said, foundation officials began thinking about what the fund could do to mitigate the effects of a reduction in government spending on city youth this summer. In looking for an answer to that question, he said, the officials consulted the seven social service agencies that receive funds from the annual Neediest Cases campaign. The agencies are: Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; Catholic Charities, Archdiocese of New York; Catholic Charities, Brooklyn and Queens; Children's Aid Society; Community Service Society of New York; Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and UJA-Federation of New York.</p>
        <p>''It was unanimous in the first minute,'' Mr. Rosenthal recalled of the conversations. ''Summer jobs, summer jobs, summer jobs.''</p>
        <p>The seven agencies will create the jobs, a mix of work in day camps, summer schools and programs for at-risk children. The new initiative, to be called the Neediest Summer Jobs Program, will be administered by the After-School Corporation, a nonprofit group that serves about 45,000 children in the city by creating donor-program partnerships.</p>
        <p>The Neediest Cases Fund is inviting individual and corporate donors to help by either creating blocks of summer jobs or making cash contributions to provide additional jobs. Each job costs about $1,300, which provides a teenager's salary, training and supervision, fund officials said.</p>
        <p>In 2001, government funds supported 50,000 summer jobs in New York City, officials at the After-School Corporation said. Last summer, the number fell to 35,000. This summer is expected to be worse still, officials who work with poor children said, although an exact number is not yet available.</p>
        <p>''Most of these kids would be on the street,'' said Lucy N. Friedman, the president of the After-School Corporation. ''Trouble would find them or they would find trouble. But now they will be actively engaged, learning and bringing income to their families.''</p>
        <p>The program is expected to have a trickle-down effect on the camps and summer schools where the young people will be working, as additional staffing will lessen the impact of any cutbacks.</p>
        <p>''The employees in turn will be given opportunities that they might not have gotten, such as going to a park,'' Ms. Friedman said. ''For some kids, it may be the first time they plant a garden, look through a pair of binoculars, go to the zoo. The data is very strong about how much kids lose during the summertime if they do not have exposure to books and reading.''</p>
        <p>The creation of the Neediest Summer Jobs Program represents a departure from the usual manner in which the fund spends money from its $26.2 million endowment. Usually, only the endowment's annual income is spent, Mr. Rosenthal said. But three years ago, the fund adopted a policy allowing it to tap into the capital in times of economic stress. The goal was to be ''countercyclical,'' Mr. Rosenthal said, ''so that if times turned tough, we'd go into the fund to try to make a difference, both directly and by trying to set an example.''</p>
        <p>Companies interested in the program may write to Mary Bleiberg, vice president for policy and planning, the After-School Corporation, 925 Ninth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10019; send an e-mail message to mbleiberg@tascorp.org; or call (212) 547-6923. Cash contributions can also be sent to that mailing address.</p>
