        <p>CHARLES FAZZINO'S vibrant 3-D serigraphs teem with tiny, whimsically rendered people -- sitting in stadium bleachers, walking down a New York City street, skiing down a mountain, so meticulously drawn that you can taste the relish on the hot dogs, hear the car horns and feel the powdery snow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazzino, born in 1955, is not embarrassed to be a commercial -- and commercially successful -- artist. He's quick to mention the celebrities who own his work. (Rosie O'Donnell, Phil Collins and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, to name three.) His art has been shown in more than 600 galleries in 20 countries. He lives in Pelham Manor and has a studio and publishing company, Museum Editions Ltd., in New Rochelle. The son of a sculptor and a shoe designer, he studied art at the New York School of Visual Arts -- but he started selling his work when he was 15.</p>

        <p>This weekend he will be in San Diego for Super Bowl XXXVII, signing the commemorative poster he made for the game.</p>
        <p>Q. How did your involvement with the National Football League come about?</p>
        <p>A. I've been a National Football League artist for five years and have done the posters for the Super Bowl for three years. It all started with my favorite teams, the Jets and the Giants. They asked me to do commemoratives for them because that is what I had been doing for the past 10 years -- commemorate special events or places, whether it be New York City or a Lower East Side deli. After that a lot of different galleries from different states who saw the pieces asked me to do commemoratives for their teams. A gallery in Cleveland wanted me to do the Cleveland Browns. The same thing with Miami, Denver and San Francisco. Wherever I had galleries, people asked me to do special commemorative editions for their customers.</p>
        <p>Q. When did audiences start discovering your work?</p>
        <p>A. People got a taste of what I do more than 20 years ago at the Washington Square outdoor art shows that ran every year. I just got started doing my dimensional pieces, had made about 20 of them, and hung them up at this art show on the street. People passed by and commented: ''Ooh, I love these little dimensional things. How much is it?'' I told them it was $100 framed. Well, I sold all 20 pieces in the first four hours. I went from doing inexpensive prints using aquarium sealant to the fine art quality, expensive silkscreen editions with handmade papers that I do today.</p>
        <p>Q. How would you define your work?</p>
        <p>A. If I had to compare my pop art with anyone else's, I suppose you could say it's a cross between maybe Andy Warhol and Red Grooms. I'd like to think my work is essentially Charles Fazzino.</p>
        <p>Q. How about those people that say your pop art is O.K. for galleries but not for fine art museums?</p>
        <p>A. I've said to many people that when Andy Warhol and Red Grooms started, they were laughed at. Norman Rockwell aspired to be in museums and now he is, of course, years after his death. I think it's the way the art world has viewed whimsical pop art in the past. It just hasn't been taken seriously.</p>
        <p>Q. You've been doing more religious pieces lately. Where did that come from?</p>
        <p>A. It came from going to all of the Lower East Side delis, like Katz's Deli and all the others that dot 23rd Street. I started doing drawings and some early editions of my favorite delis. People loved them. Then I started painting the street synagogues and the art galleries would ask, did you ever think about doing something just on Hanukkah and other Jewish holidays?</p>
        <p>Q. How did you get involved with doing pieces for charities?</p>
        <p>A. I started out doing artwork for a local charity here in Westchester called Project Child. I was honored when they asked me if they could use my work to raise money for their charity.</p>
        <p>Q. Word has it that your daughter Heather is getting some buzz in the art world herself.</p>
        <p>A. Yes, it's great. She's 12 years old and has done sell-out art shows for Art Expo since she was 7. She sells to art galleries that don't even collect my work. She doesn't do 3-D though. She has her own style.</p>
