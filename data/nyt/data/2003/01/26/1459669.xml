        <p>THE RIGHT MAN</p>
        <p>The Surprise Presidency</p>
        <p>of George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>By David Frum.</p>
        <p>303 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $25.95.</p>
        <p>THE problem with White House speechwriters, from a president's point of view, is that they tend to take good notes. Even more worrying, they sometimes turn those notes into candid memoirs of their White House years. For this reason, speechwriters move through the West Wing under special clouds of suspicion.</p>
        <p>But the crowded shelf of memoirs suggests that many speechwriters are either unintimidated or indiscreet, and our understanding of the presidents they served is the richer for it. The first of these books was also one of the finest: in 1952, Samuel Rosenman, who wrote for Franklin D. Roosevelt and edited his presidential papers, published an engrossing account of the words, ideas and events of the 1930's and 40's that transformed this nation and its role in the world.</p>
        <p>''Is it important,'' Rosenman asks, ''to know who the people were who helped in the preparation of speeches?'' If his own account leaves any doubt, his successors have surely dispelled it. Most modern presidencies have yielded at least one vital contribution to the genre: Harry McPherson on the Johnson years; Richard Goodwin on Johnson and the Kennedys; William Safire on Nixon; Peggy Noonan on Reagan; Michael Waldman on Clinton.</p>
        <p>Enter David Frum, whose new book, ''The Right Man,'' covers the eventful first year of George W. Bush's administration. Shortly after Inauguration Day, 2001, Frum traded his renown as a conservative commentator for the relative obscurity of a room in the Old Executive Office Building, and stayed until February 2002. His memoir -- the first to emerge from this famously tight-lipped administration -- is often engaging, if not especially revealing.</p>
        <p>For Washington gossips, there is precious little dish here: no court astrologers; no powers behind the throne; no stories that truly surprise. More disappointing, for the rest of us, there are few insights that enhance our understanding of Bush or his presidency. Of all the candid comments that Frum attributes to Bush, only six appear to have been collected firsthand. What is here, in abundance, is lively, chatty commentary. ''The Right Man'' reads like a collection of op-eds that skim and occasionally penetrate the surface. Frum, the author of three other books and innumerable essays, has an instinct for the telling anecdote and clever simile: ''The Enron news,'' he writes, ''hit the Bush White House like a death in the family.''</p>
        <p>With lines like this, Frum stakes out some critical distance between himself and his former colleagues. (And as one of the few Jewish staffers in an overwhelmingly evangelical White House, he allows that some of that distance is real, and cultural.) Frum can be surprisingly frank in his assessments: of the Bush cabinet, which he deems ''solid'' but hardly stellar; of compassionate conservatism, an ''agglomeration of little ideas . . . wrapped together to look like a big idea''; and especially of the former presidential adviser Karen Hughes, who fares terribly here by comparison with her rival, Karl Rove.</p>
        <p>''Rove was a risk taker and an intellectual. Hughes loathed risk and abhorred ideas,'' Frum writes. ''Rove was a reader and a questioner -- a curious man, always eager to learn. Hughes rarely read books and distrusted people who did -- anything she did not already know she saw no point in knowing.'' Frum sees Rove vs. Hughes as more than a grudge match. It was a battle between contrasting political strategies: Rove's approach, which saw the electorate as defined by demographics and sought to conquer it one bloc at a time, and Hughes's, which, Frum says, perceived all Americans as essentially alike and easily manipulated by the same simple story line.</p>
        <p>As for Bush himself, Frum is forthright about the president's ''many faults,'' among them that he is ''often uncurious and as a result ill informed.'' Frum's Bush is a more complex protagonist than, say, Noonan's Reagan, lending credence to his portrayal. Still, as the book's title suggests, Frum judges the president's liabilities to be outweighed by ''his virtues: decency, honesty, rectitude, courage and tenacity.'' He is ''nothing short of superb as a wartime leader.''</p>
        <p>As this suggests, ''The Right Man'' is a careful, loyal book. For the most part it hews closely to the official White House talking points. Perhaps Frum is simply preserving his connections.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, some of Frum's predecessors might have advised him to wait awhile: McPherson was out of office four years before offering his assessment; Goodwin took 20. Tempers cool over time; perspective broadens and insight deepens. As it is, we are only halfway through a four-year presidential term, and Frum has allowed himself scant time to reflect. The pressure to publish or perish appears as heavy now in politics as in academia; and while Frum, a historian by training, offers observations for the ages, he is hip-deep in the fray.</p>
        <p>Throughout, ''The Right Man'' betrays the rancor of partisan combat. Of the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle -- who, four months after Sept. 11, has the nerve to challenge the president's plan for more tax cuts -- Frum snaps that Daschle's ''larger aim'' is nothing less than ''shattering the mood of national unity and returning the country to politics-as-usual -- or rather, politics-uglier-than-ever.'' Few events appear to rankle Frum more than the defection of Senator James Jeffords, who left the Republican Party in May 2001, shifting control of the Senate to the Democrats. In Frum's telling, Jeffords is ''weak and vain,'' a ''liberal'' with ''a more than ordinary fondness for the status and power of a committee chairman.'' (This, it must be noted, would be quite an accomplishment in the United States Senate.)</p>
        <p>Frum's previous books have been praised -- rightly -- for their nuanced and unconventional outlook. So it is surprising that his analysis here is often glib and ungratifying. ''The Right Man'' frequently resorts to the type of cant one encounters on talk radio: according to Frum, global agreements like the Kyoto Accords and the international convention on land mines are simply the schemings of ''ill wishers'' -- some of them our fellow citizens -- who ''oppose American power.'' Not much nuance there.</p>
        <p>As a speechwriter, too, Frum favors bold, blunt rhetoric -- Reaganesque ''truth telling'' that makes our enemies quake and our allies quiver. It was Frum who contributed the notion of an ''axis of evil,'' which became the animating idea of Bush's State of the Union address in January 2002 -- and, a month later, sparked a controversial coda to Frum's White House tenure.</p>
        <p>The trouble began with an e-mail message by Frum's wife announcing to family and friends that her husband had written the ''axis of evil'' segment of the speech. Someone leaked the message to Slate, the online magazine. Its publication happened to coincide with Frum's exit, prompting a Washington parlor game: did Frum jump, or was he shoved? Here (as elsewhere) Frum insists that he submitted his resignation a month before his wife's message saw print.</p>
        <p>The evolution of ''axis of evil'' is one of the book's highlights. What's missing, unfortunately, is much discussion of what such explosive pronouncements mean in practice. Bush's mention of North Korea -- ''added to the axis last'' -- merits only a few sentences here, mostly concerning Frum's pleasure at Pyongyang's pique. North Korea's near absence from this book makes its inclusion in the dishonor roll seem what some critics have feared: a provocative afterthought with profound consequences.</p>
        <p>Frum's omissions do not necessarily signal any lack of debate in the West Wing. But that is the point: there is not enough information in ''The Right Man'' to venture a guess. And fairly or otherwise, we expect White House memoirs to offer more revelation than retread.</p>
        <p>Few meet that standard, but it is one worth striving for. After all, as Hamilton Jordan, the adviser to Jimmy Carter, has written, ''the battles over a president's words are really struggles over the heart and soul of his presidency.'' Jordan was referring not to the anguished search for the perfect words but to the contest for control of the presidential agenda, in which a speech -- or even a phrase like ''axis of evil'' -- can tip the balance.</p>
