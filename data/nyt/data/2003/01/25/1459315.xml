        <p>'Details'  New York Theater Workshop</p>
        <p>Normally a play performed entirely in Danish with a run of just four days would not command New York newspaper space, but here the director is Bille August, an acclaimed filmmaker (he won an Oscar for his 1988 film ''Pelle the Conqueror'') making his stage directorial debut.</p>
        <p>The play, ''Details'' by Lars Noren, relies on an avalanche of words to convey the emptiness of its characters' lives. They talk a lot but rarely communicate.</p>
        <p>That leaves them sitting at tables quite a bit, so it is difficult to discern the directorial hand, especially for those listening to an English translation on headsets. Yet by the play's end the four actors (Ole Lemmeke, Benedikte Hansen, Helle Fagralid and Nicolai Dahl Hamilton) have all left vivid impressions, so Mr. August must have brought some of his filmmaking magic to bear.</p>
        <p>The play, being performed through tomorrow, looks at the vacuous side of the 1990's through two men and two women. They travel incessantly, running into one another with a frequency that strains credulity, and as their self-absorbed, sex-obsessed lives progress, they switch partners but still find fulfillment elusive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Noren touches many themes already exhausted by television movies: absentee fathers, fertility problems, women reaching midlife and feeling they have achieved nothing. It is a bleak but familiar concoction. ''Where did the joy go?'' one character asks late in the play. Responds another, ''Was there joy?''</p>
