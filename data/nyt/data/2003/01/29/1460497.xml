His legacy lives on in the countless numbers of patients who benefit from excellent health care through this network. We extend sincere condolences to his wife, Ellie, and to his entire family. Eric A. Rose, M.D., Chairman Columbia University Department of Surgery, Columbia Prestyterian Medical Center NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital</p>
