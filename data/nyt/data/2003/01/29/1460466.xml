        <p>A fugitive wanted in connection with the 1989 murder of two garbage haulers was arrested Monday evening in a Bronx doughnut shop, officials announced yesterday. The murdered haulers had been credited with helping the authorities break a Mafia stranglehold on the Long Island garbage industry. The fugitive, Frank Pearl Federico, 75, disappeared in 1993, shortly before he was scheduled to provide blood and hair samples for comparison with samples found where the garbage carters, Robert M. Kubecka and Donald Barstow, brothers-in-law, were fatally shot. Yesterday, the authorities said that it was not clear where Mr. Federico, described as a soldier in the Luchese family, had been for the last 10 years, but that they believed he had spent time hiding in Europe. Mr. Federico was arrested in the Bronx, where he had planned to meet a former associate, officials said. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment in Federal District Court in Brooklyn and was ordered held without bail.</p>
