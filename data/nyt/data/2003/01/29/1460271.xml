        <p>As a Martha Graham dancer falls prone, one foot is extended and pointed, the other flexed, digging into the floor. In this deliberate dislocation, Graham aligns the human body toward maximum expressiveness.</p>
        <p>Here is the asymmetry close to her heart, embodying the emotional jaggedness of life, both modern and eternal, and anything but neat.</p>
        <p>You could follow this familiar drop to the floor, so basic to Graham's dance technique, from work to work when the Martha Graham Dance Company presented ''Appalachian Spring,'' an Americana landmark, and other Graham classics on Thursday and Friday at the Joyce Theater.</p>
        <p>Yet in each piece, the same fall had different dramatic meaning. There was no contradiction: for Graham, a leap or a fall was a signature for energy, not a literal representation of one idea.</p>
        <p>How to keep the form that Graham made expressive (pure dance was not her way) has been the task of every Graham dancer. Some succeed better than others, and among the debuts on these programs, Virginie Mécène's wonderfully joyful Bride in ''Appalachian Spring'' and Alessandra Prosperi's strangely soulful heroine in ''Errand Into the Maze'' were outstanding.</p>
        <p>Unlike ''Frontier,'' performed earlier this season, ''Appalachian Spring'' is not about exploring the American West but about its settlement. Aaron Copland's commissioned score (1944) incorporates a Shaker hymn, and Isamu Noguchi's set has a Shaker spareness and beauty in its abstraction of a rocking chair and a frame house.</p>
        <p>Although seemingly about the past, the work was Graham's affirmation of democratic values during World War II. In her original script for Copland, she spoke of ''a legend of American living'' that should ''by theatrical clarity, add up to a sense of place.''</p>
        <p>The current production is not as integrated as the revealing staging, with its especially tender love story, that the veteran Graham dancer Yuriko did for the Joffrey Ballet two years ago. Yet if the cast here is uneven, there are attempts at dramatic continuity. Beverly Emmons's lighting, for example, gambles on novelty and succeeds. Twilight falls, and the sky grows unusually dark blue. It is the end of a day celebrating a roof raising. It is also the end of a journey of doubt, vanquished by traditional open-frontier optimism.</p>
        <p>The Bride has two main solos -- an outburst of happiness and a dance filled with qualms about the future -- as well as a love duet, a hoedown in miniature with her farmer husband. A preacher intrudes with his fire and brimstone but is countered by the mature wisdom of the Pioneering Woman.</p>
        <p>On Thursday Miki Orihara was superbly attentive to detail, although her reserve minimized the contrast between the two solos. She is a melancholy Bride, tenderly consoled by Tadej Brdnik as the Husbandman. He understands his role but lacks the powerful ballet technique incorporated into the dancing. Gary Galbraith's Revivalist is steely-eyed but jarringly incomplete in his movement. Katherine Crockett has the right breadth for the Pioneering Woman; the preacher's adoring followers (Erica Dankmeyer, Carrie Ellmore-Tallitsch, Yuko Suzuki and Blakeley White-McGuire) are a well-drilled, bouncy flock.</p>
        <p>The stage action was more integrated on Friday night with the debuts of Ms. Mécène as the Bride and Christophe Jeannot as the Revivalist, vivid and menacing through his dynamism. Mr. Galbraith, new as the Husbandman, again lacked clear shape, this time losing power and height in the balletic barrel jumps. Another debut came from the young Heidi Stoeckley, promising in her serenity as the Pioneering Woman.</p>
        <p>Unlike Ms. Orihara, who wore a lavender dress, Ms. Mécène's Bride was in peach and irrepressibly happy in the first solo. This joy rightly burst through the nervous energy she brought to the darker solo.</p>
        <p>Although there is a tendency this season to make the movement liquid, Ms. Prosperi knows that the Graham idiom is essentially percussive and angular. These are the qualities she brought on Friday to the woman battling a bull-like allegorical figure of fear in ''Errand Into the Maze.'' You could feel her pain because there was depth to her movement. Mr. Jeannot brought a similar sharpness to the man-beast.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Jeannot, the young Ari Mayzik brings utter clarity to Graham's choreography. You can spot him in the archaic chorus that amplifies the love theme so majestically in ''Dark Meadow.'' Ms. Orihara's debut on Friday as its questing heroine had lyricism but was all in one key. In the Mexican-Indian passion play of ''El Penitente,'' Mr. Brdnik brought a winning faux-naïf quality to the penitent seduced by Elizabeth Auclair's lively temptress. Martin Lofsnes had an awesome spring as the Christ Figure, once danced by Merce Cunningham.</p>
