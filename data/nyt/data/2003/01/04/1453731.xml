        <p>The weather and the field will provide some extra suspense for today's first-round playoff game between the Jets and the Indianapolis Colts.</p>
        <p>Game time is 4:30 p.m. at Giants Stadium. Significant snowfall is not expected during the game, but there may be some flurries, according to Penn State's meteorology department. The forecast also calls for cloudy skies and winds from the northwest at 10 to 20 miles an hour. The winds should diminish before the game ends.</p>
        <p>The field was entirely resodded early this week after being trampled last weekend during the games between the Jets and Green Bay and the Giants and Philadelphia. A tarp was put on the field Thursday afternoon, before the sleet, rain and snow arrived, and it could remain on as late as 3 p.m. today to protect the new turf. Then the field will have to fend for itself.</p>
        <p>''The cooler it is, the firmer the field will be,'' said Erik Stover, the assistant director of operations for Giants Stadium. ''That's what the players should be hoping for. It was in good condition before we covered it. If it rains, it will get soft. It's like your front yard.''</p>
        <p>The condition of the field has been a lingering issue this season -- an experimental grass-tray system never quite worked -- and this will be the third natural-grass surface the Jets will be playing on since September. Next season, the field is likely to be a synthetic turf that is softer and more forgiving than the previous artificial surface.</p>
