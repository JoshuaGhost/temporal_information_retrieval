        <p>Venezuela's embattled president, Hugo Chávez, said today that he favored the creation of a group of ''Friends of Venezuela'' to lead an international diplomatic effort to end the monthlong general strike that has crippled oil production and brought normal activity to a halt in his country.</p>
        <p>The Venezuelan leader was here for the inauguration Wednesday of Brazil's new president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. He made the announcement at a news conference after a breakfast meeting with Mr. da Silva, leader of the left-wing Workers Party and an advocate of a negotiated solution to the growing turbulence in Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil producer.</p>
        <p>''This is a good initiative,'' Mr. Chávez said this afternoon. ''Any country that wants to cooperate will be welcome.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chávez, a former army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup attempt in 1992, said the composition of the support group and the exact role it might play were still in the talking stages. But he said that he expected that the countries taking part would be drawn from Latin America, Europe and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, which Venezuela helped found more than 40 years ago.</p>
        <p>At a news conference this evening, Mr. da Silva's spokesman, André Singer, said Mr. da Silva had asked the governments of Spain and Portugal to join him in trying to bring about ''a peaceful resolution'' to the standoff in Venezuela. Mr. Chávez returned to Caracas this afternoon, but Mr. da Silva was scheduled to have dinner here tonight with Fidel Castro, the Cuban leader, and was expected to discuss the Venezuelan situation with him.</p>
        <p>The Venezuelan leader, whose 1998 election mandate was reconfirmed by another national vote in 2000, said that he had also met with Libyan officials and other Latin American heads of state while here. He said his fellow presidents were universally supportive, in part because they fear that the demands that Mr. Chávez be replaced might establish a precedent that could undermine their own hold on power.</p>
        <p>Jimmy Carter, the former United States president, and César Gaviria, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, have tried to mediate the political crisis in Venezuela, so far without much visible success. Mr. Chávez said the ''Friends of Venezuela'' group could serve a similar function, but also made it clear that his negotiating position had not changed.</p>
        <p>The strike, which comes eight months after Mr. Chávez was briefly deposed in a military-led rebellion, has been organized by a coalition of business, labor and retired military leaders. They have called for Mr. Chávez's removal from office through institutional means, such as new presidential elections or activating a provision in the Venezuelan Constitution for a referendum.</p>
        <p>''Moving elections up is impossible,'' Mr. Chávez said today. ''A referendum, yes, but only at the midpoint of my term,'' which would be in mid-August of this year.</p>
        <p>Venezuela has the largest reserves of oil outside the Middle East and is a leading supplier of gasoline and heating oil to the United States. But executives and many workers at the Venezuelan state oil company, Pdvsa, have supported the strike, causing normal production of about 2.5 million barrels a day to drop by as much as 90 percent and leading to supply shortages and long lines at gasoline stations.</p>
        <p>''What is going on in my country is not a strike,'' Mr. Chávez charged today. ''It is a coup attempt disguised as a strike,'' organized by ''terrorists who are blocking oil and food distribution and sabotaging refineries.''</p>
        <p>To relieve that pressure, Brazil last week sent an oil tanker with 520,000 barrels of gasoline to Venezuela. Mr. Chávez said he had asked both Mr. da Silva and Brazil's departing president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, to approve the shipment and acknowledged that if the situation continued he might have to ask for additional fuel supplies from Brazil and other allies.</p>
        <p>''Yes, that's possible,'' he said, adding that his government had already been in contact with both OPEC members and neighboring countries like Mexico, Ecuador and Trinidad and Tobago. A Russian tanker loaded with 600,000 barrels of gasoline should be arriving in Venezuela soon, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singer, the Brazilian presidential spokesman, said Mr. Chávez had also requested that the Brazilian tanker be allowed to remain in Venezuela to haul gasoline from refineries there to Caracas. No decision has yet been made, he added.</p>
        <p>Mr. da Silva has expressed his admiration for Mr. Chávez and his ''Bolivarian Revolution,'' saying that the Venezuelan leader ''thinks like I do.'' Mr. Chávez in turn welcomed the Workers Party landslide victory here in October, saying he hoped that Mr. da Silva would join him and Mr. Castro in building a Latin American ''axis of good.''</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Chávez said he hoped the Venezuelan and Brazilian state oil companies would create a joint venture that could be extended to other nations in the region and act as a sort of ''Latin American OPEC.'' He said Mr. da Silva had expressed his ''total support'' and predicted that Brazil and Venezuela would make ''great advances together in the coming years'' because of the similar views that he and Mr. da Silva share.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chávez was dismissive of news reports from Caracas that opposition leaders were now willing to begin temporarily limiting their strike action, an offer that does not extend to the oil industry, which accounts for about 80 percent of Venezuela's exports. He argued that the proposal was not a good faith gesture but a sign of weakness.</p>
        <p>''The Venezuelan opposition is divided and fragmented,'' he said. He described the leaders of the strike as ''a fifth column who would stab their own mothers in the back'' and said that ''no one can accept this kind of blackmail.''</p>
        <p>''We have to dig in and defend ourselves,'' he said.</p>
