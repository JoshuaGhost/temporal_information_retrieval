        <p>William C Rhoden Sports of The Times column contends that New York Giants's loss to San Francisco 49ers in playoffs, whether fault of long snapper Trey Junkin or place-kicker Matt Bryant, occurred because 49ers are better team and Giants could not find reliable long snapper or place-kicker; photos (M)</p>

        <p>HOW do you build a 38-14 third-quarter lead and lose?</p>
        <p>The Giants and their fans will have the winter to figure it out.</p>
        <p>You can look at the Giants' collapse yesterday two ways: through the legs of Trey Junkin, the 41-year-old long snapper the Giants picked up last week, or through the fragile psyche of Matt Bryant, the up-and-down place-kicker whose luck ran out when he needed it most.</p>
        <p>With six seconds left and the Giants needing a field goal to win, Junkin botched Bryant's attempt, which ended with the holder, Matt Allen, scrambling and heaving a last gasp pass to nobody, nowhere.</p>
        <p>This was actually the second bad snap. The Giants could have taken a 41-33 lead, but Junkin nearly rolled the snap, and Bryant missed the 42-yard attempt.</p>
        <p>Blame the snapper, blame the kicker, blame whomever you wish. But the Giants allowed the 49ers to pull off one of the most dramatic comebacks in playoff history. Now they will have to sit and watch.</p>
        <p>The larger question is how a team with aspirations of going deep into the playoffs allows itself to get this desperate. Junkin had filed retirement papers with the league last month. Then the Giants signed him, and he replaced Dan O'Leary, who tore a thumb ligament.</p>
        <p>Bryant was signed a day before the regular season began, and he has not been miserable. He hit 26 of 32 field-goal attempts and made crucial kicks against Seattle, Washington and Philadelphia. He also missed a short attempt in an inglorious 2-point loss at Houston.</p>
        <p>We can go on and on about the kicking game. Remember the Giants' game at Minnesota when the snapper of the day, Bob Jones, and the holder of the moment, Tom Rouen, mangled a snap and a hold? Remember Houston, where Jones snapped the ball over the punter's head for a safety? And remember just last weekend, when Bryant missed a 36-yard attempt against Philadelphia in the third quarter?</p>
        <p>But the reality is that the Giants aren't better than the 49ers. Giants fans should take the season and call themselves fortunate. After digging themselves out of a huge hole, saving Coach Jim Fassel's job and holding out the promise of two resurgent New York teams doing battle in San Diego in Super Bowl XXXVII, the Giants were done in by another kicking-game glitch.</p>
        <p>Bryant had saved the day last weekend against the Eagles by nailing the game-winning field goal in overtime. Yesterday, with the season on the line, Junkin's snap nearly bounced back to the holder, and that was the Giants' season.</p>
        <p>You can beat up on the kicker and the snapper all you want. You can talk about the Giants' squandering a lead and losing the game. But this loss wasn't about giving something away, it was about the 49ers -- specifically wide receiver Terrell Owens and quarterback Jeff Garcia -- snatching a victory.</p>
        <p>This was great theater -- maybe not for Giants fans, but certainly for a national audience and 66,318 fans at Candlestick Park who witnessed a minor miracle. Do not beat up on Junkin and Bryant. They were over their heads in a stadium where stars are supposed to dominate.</p>
        <p>That is what playoffs are about. That is what Garcia and Owens are about: performing at the moment of truth.</p>
        <p>You don't have to go further than Owens, who in many minds was mostly a showboat who used zany touchdown celebrations to call attention to himself. In October against Seattle, Owens pulled a pen out of his sock after a touchdown catch, autographed the ball and handed it to his financial adviser.</p>
        <p>Truth be told, for two quarters yesterday, the 49ers' No. 81, Owens, was outshone and outdueled by the Giants' No. 81, Amani Toomer.</p>
        <p>Owens scored on a 76-yard pass play on San Francisco's first play of the game but Toomer, who was raised in nearby Berkeley, owned the first half. He scored on a 12-yard pass that tied the score at 7-7, on an 8-yard pass that put the Giants up by 21-14 and on a 24-yard pass that put the Giants ahead, 28-14.</p>
        <p>But a player like Owens talks the talk, walks the walk, pulls a pen out of his sock, shakes pompoms and roasts defensive backs. While Toomer and the Giants cooled off, Owens and the 49ers roared back. Even after the Giants took a 38-14 lead on two field goals by Bryant, San Francisco was gaining.</p>
        <p>Owens caught a 32-yard pass from Garcia. Two plays later he scored, then caught the 2-point conversion. A few minutes later, Garcia scored and Owens caught yet another conversion pass. Owens caught two more passes on a drive that led to a field goal that cut the Giants' lead to 38-33.</p>
        <p>Toomer wasn't completely shut out: his 17-yard catch set up a Tiki Barber touchdown that extended the Giants' lead to 35-14. His 46-yard catch set up a field goal that gave the Giants a seemingly insurmountable lead, 38-14. But that was Toomer's final reception until there were seconds left in the game.</p>
        <p>At the moment of truth, Owens emerged. The 49ers went ahead on a 13-yard touchdown pass from Garcia to Tai Streets, and that was the game.</p>
        <p>End of story. End of season.</p>
        <p>For all the attention that will be paid to the penalties and the bizarre field-goal attempt at the end of the game, the Giants had already backed themselves into an unnecessary corner. The 49ers and Owens snatched away the game and the Giants' will.</p>
        <p>I'm not saying that nice guys finish last or that you have to jump up and down to make a point. But at this level, at this time of the season, you have to let your play do the talking.</p>
        <p>The 49ers did, the Giants did not, and there will be no Subway Super Bowl.</p>
