        <p>Rich Leonardi letter replies to Paul E Dintner's Jan 1 Op-Ed article linking child abuse scandal in Roman Catholic Church to culture of clerical deference to authority</p>

        <p>''A Catholic Crisis, Bestowed From Above,'' by Paul E. Dinter (Op-Ed, Jan. 1), says many priests remained silent after the ''out of sync'' papal encyclical Humanae Vitae, which famously opposed contraception.

        <p>Humanae Vitae was not greeted with total priestly silence. Pope Paul VI, apparently fearing schism, allowed the dissenting priests to go unrebuked. This papal reluctance taught American bishops that the Vatican would not support efforts to maintain priestly discipline and doctrinal integrity, a lesson not forgotten when the church faced new crises in subsequent decades.</p>

        <p>Mr. Dinter objects to papal authority, despite its 2,000-year pedigree. But as the aftermath of Humanae Vitae makes clear, a congregational Catholic church unmoored from orthodoxy would likely have more crises, not fewer.</p>
