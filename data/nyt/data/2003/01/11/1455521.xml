        <p>Two days after New Jersey officials ordered child welfare workers to visit 280 children who are the subject of abuse investigations, caseworkers have been unable to locate 110 of them, officials said today.</p>
        <p>Gov. James E. McGreevey ordered a review on Monday of every child abuse case in the state after learning of a series of investigative failures in the case of three brothers, one of whom had been found dead in a locked basement in Newark. On Wednesday the state declared a state of emergency at the Division of Youth and Family Services because officials had identified 280 cases in which children who had reportedly been abused had not yet been seen by caseworkers.</p>
        <p>Gwendolyn L. Harris, Mr. McGreevey's commissioner of Human Services, said today that only 170 of the children had been located, and caseworkers were trying to track down the others by using ''extraordinary measures,'' like cutting off welfare payments or asking police departments to join the search. Ms. Harris said that some families named in child abuse complaints are hard to locate because they are transient, but that others actively resist the state's intervention. In Newark today, she said, one parent sicced a pit bull on a caseworker who was searching for a child.</p>
        <p>The commissioner's comments came as she and Mr. McGreevey gave a detailed assessment of the case of 7-year-old Faheem Williams, who was found dead in the basement of a Newark home last Sunday along with two brothers who were kept chained in the same basement. The governor and the commissioner also offered their first proposals to rebuild the child welfare system that had failed to protect the boys.</p>
        <p>The governor said the caseworker's decision in December to close the case without seeing the children was indefensible, but noted that supervisors in the Division of Youth and Family Services had not offered adequate guidance, and that other agencies, including schools and law enforcement, had failed repeatedly to provide social workers with data they requested about the family.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGreevey assigned his deputy chief of operations to take temporary charge of the Newark office where the Williams case was handled, and where officials with the caseworkers' union said the system's problems were most severe. The state, the governor said, will also install a computer system to track abuse cases, create new case specialists in each office to help handle the most difficult investigations, and order senior managers to become involved in any decisions to close abuse cases.</p>
        <p>''What we've done today is stem the bleeding,'' Mr. McGreevey said.</p>
        <p>Although the governor has pledged to offer a more detailed overhaul plan, child welfare advocates said they were disappointed by the scope of the measures he offered today. Cecilia Zalkind, executive director of the Association for Children of New Jersey, said that many of the proposals Mr. McGreevey announced were already being developed or were such long-term projects that they would offer little relief to a system in crisis.</p>
        <p>''The question would be, would these recommendations prevent a case like this from happening in the future?'' she said. ''I'm not sure they would have a significant impact.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Zalkind said the agency needed an infusion of resources to pay for more caseworkers, and an overhaul of its policies, recruitment, and supervision. Others have asked Mr. McGreevey to remove D.Y.F.S. from the Department of Human Services and create a Department of Child Welfare headed by a cabinet level commissioner.</p>
        <p>But the governor said that New Jersey's previous attempts to improve its child welfare system had not failed because of any bureaucratic flaw. He said the system was in disarray because for decades, state leaders and child welfare professionals had faltered in their commitment to the problem.</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of more bureaucratic reshuffling, it's a matter of accountability and responsibility,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In analyzing the Williams case, the governor and Commissioner Harris found that caseworkers had failed to protect the three brothers by conducting incomplete investigations during a two and a half year period in which the children were only seen once by a caseworker. The assessment by Mr. McGreevey and Commissioner Harris also criticized caseworkers and supervisors for failing to recommend that the children be placed in foster care when it became clear that their mother could not care for them.</p>
        <p>The mother, Melinda Williams, told the police that last March she left her three boys with Sherry L. Murphy, a cousin, while she served a jail sentence for child endangerment. Ms. Williams said she could not find the children when she was released last summer. The boys were found in Ms. Murphy's basement.</p>
        <p>The state has already suspended the caseworker, saying that in 2001 she had not adequately reported an allegation of sexual abuse involving one of Faheem Williams's brothers. The supervisor who approved the closing of the case was also suspended, Commissioner Harris said, because the case file clearly noted that the children had not been seen by investigators in more than a year.</p>
        <p>Union leaders have complained that employees were being unfairly punished. The system, according to the officials, is so overburdened that caseworkers are forced to handle unmanageably high caseloads and are pressured to close cases.</p>
        <p>Beyond the breakdowns within the agency, the analysis pointed to responses to caseworkers' requests for information about the family.</p>
        <p>''The failure of government in this instance to safeguard the health and welfare of these children is beyond excuse,'' Mr. McGreevey said. ''It is sickening.''</p>
