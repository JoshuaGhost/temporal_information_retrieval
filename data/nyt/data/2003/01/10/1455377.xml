        <p>The Philadelphia Flyers rumbled into Nassau Coliseum tonight, but the Islanders were waiting. The Islanders won two fights in the first three minutes to sprinkle cayenne pepper on what was already expected to be a savory game.</p>
        <p>Then, for no apparent reason, the Islanders started to lose battles for the puck and tumbled to Philadelphia, 4-0. The Flyers have won five straight games, but this was the Islanders' chance to show how far they have come in the last month.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Islanders (18-17-5-1) lost in regulation for the first time since Dec. 21, when Washington beat them at Nassau Coliseum. The Flyers (22-10-8-1), the first-place team in the Atlantic Division, lead the Islanders by 11 points.</p>
        <p>The Islanders also slipped into ninth place in the Eastern Conference. Montreal rallied to beat the Rangers, 3-2, and has 43 points in 42 games; the Islanders have 42 points in 41 games.</p>
        <p>''We couldn't even talk about winning the one-on-one battles, because we weren't engaging in them for two periods,'' said Michael Peca, the Islanders' captain.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia goalie Roman Cechmanek stopped 24 shots for his first shutout of the season. The Islanders had not been shut out since Nov. 7 at Montreal, which was their sixth loss in a row.</p>
        <p>''We didn't get much traffic,'' Islanders defenseman Adrian Aucoin said. ''We basically had two guys who showed up and won two fights.''</p>
        <p>The Islanders' power play has become a problem. Not only did the Islanders fail to score a goal in five power-play chances, but they also gave up a short-handed goal, and Philadelphia's Ã‰ric Desjardins scored nine seconds after a Flyers penalty ended.</p>
        <p>''We found ourselves on the wrong side of the battles,'' Islanders Coach Peter Laviolette said.</p>
        <p>The Islanders got uncharacteristically poor performances from defensemen Aucoin and Roman Hamrlik, who each had a turnover that led to a Philadelphia goal.</p>
        <p>''Everyone knew what the situation was,'' goaltender Garth Snow said, referring to the race for a playoff spot. ''There was no excuse to have such low energy.''</p>
        <p>That was not supposed to happen after the way the game started. Only 2 minutes 13 seconds had elapsed when Islanders defenseman Eric Cairns fought Flyers left wing Donald Brashear -- and won. The Flyers' other tough guy, Todd Fedoruk, was promptly sent onto the ice, but so was the Islanders rookie Eric Godard, who is a fearsome and fearless puncher. Three seconds after the face-off, Godard fought Fedoruk and landed nearly 20 punches.</p>
        <p>The fights should have stirred the Islanders, but they hardly tested Cechmanek, who faced only one shot in the first seven minutes. The Flyers, playing deliberately, took a 1-0 lead at 7:16 after Aucoin made a rare turnover.</p>
        <p>Aucoin lost the puck at the Islanders' blue line to Flyers center Keith Primeau, who was joined by Pavel Brendl in a two-on-one rush. Primeau slipped a pass behind Aucoin to Brendl, who easily beat Snow. ''It was not a good play on my part,'' Aucoin said.</p>
        <p>Snow gave up a long goal to Jeremy Roenick at 15:53 with the Flyers skating short-handed.</p>
        <p>The fans began to boo when the Flyers took a 3-0 lead 17 seconds after the end of an Islanders power play that lasted 3:43. Hamrlik was to blame for this goal. Snow stopped a long shot, and Hamrlik tried to sweep it out of the zone. He swept it to Philadelphia center Marty Murray, who flicked in a long shot before Snow got back to the goal.</p>
        <p>Desjardins scored in the third period to help the Flyers hand the Islanders their worst loss since St. Louis hammered them on Nov. 2, 6-1.</p>
        <p>''We had a chance to move up in the standings,'' Laviolette said when asked what bothered him the most about tonight's loss.</p>
