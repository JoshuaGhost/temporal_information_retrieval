      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A word of optimism crept into the retail reports of the holiday shopping season that were released yesterday.</p>
        <p>Taken together, December's comparable-store sales, compiled from stores open at least a year, rose about 1.6 percent from last year, the most disappointing increase in at least a decade.</p>
        <p>But some companies said yesterday that the profit on the items sold was higher than it was last year. That and lower inventories -- some caused by the West Coast dock strike, which may have been a blessing in disguise -- add up to a challenging, but not desperate, retail environment for 2003.</p>
        <p>When dissected, yesterday's numbers presented a more complex picture of the holiday retailing season than had been anticipated.</p>
        <p>''The news is mixed,'' said Ken Perkins, a retail analyst with Thomson First Call, which compiles analysts' estimates. ''Over all, they were weak -- but not as bad as the doom and gloom pronounced during the Christmas season.''</p>
        <p>Chief executives at some of the leading department stores, including Lord &amp; Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue, said their profit margins were higher because they had stocked more private-label clothes. Analysts say that there are too many factories in Asia, leading to to lower prices. Many factories, desperate for business, sold their goods at discounts of up to 20 percent -- a ray of hope in a gloomy picture for merchants.</p>
        <p>And, because of weakness after the terrorist attacks in 2001, retailers had already cut their inventories.</p>
        <p>''Inventories were very clean, and the retailers were able to buy the stuff very cheaply,'' said Jennifer Black, a retail analyst at Wells Fargo Securities.</p>
        <p>As one example of yin-yang retail results, analysts yesterday cited Ann Taylor . Looking at just the December sales, one might think the store chain was in major trouble: sales were down 14.6 percent compared with Christmas 2001, which itself was hardly a boom time. But gross profit margins were up 3 percent this year, which means Ann Taylor made more money on many of the goods sold, which may translate into better-than-expected earnings.</p>
        <p>''We anticipate further gross margin improvement in January despite the highly promotional retail climate,'' J. Patrick Spainhour, Ann Taylor's chief executive, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Saks, too, reported weak comparable sales -- a drop of 2.1 percent -- but predicted that ''the year-over-year decline in fourth-quarter sales will be offset by improvement in the company's operating margin.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Black said the excess capacity at the Asian factories ''is probably going to continue for spring '03, but the competitive pricing may ease off in fall '03.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Black named Pacific Sunwear of California, Liz Claiborne and the Philips-Van Heusen Corporation as other companies with stronger-than-expected profit margins over the holidays.</p>
        <p>In statements yesterday, Gap, Pier One, Shoe Carnival, Target, Men's Wearhouse and the TJX Companies, which own T. J. Maxx and Marshall's, also reported that profit margins had been strong.</p>
        <p>Some store chains won big -- especially the teenage retailers Hot Topic, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and Pacific Sunwear -- largely because of the popularity of gift cards.</p>
        <p>The gift cards -- gift certificates in plastic -- made up 72 percent of holiday sales at Hot Topic, which had a rise of 10.6 percdent in same-store sales, and the cards accounted for 42 percent of sales at Pacific Sunwear, where comparable sales rose 16.1 percent.</p>
        <p>And Gap is winning again. After more than 20 consecutive months of declines, the company came back strong during the holidays, and was up 5 percent for December. ''Earnings for the fourth quarter are going to be huge,'' Ms. Black said. Wells Fargo is predicting growth margins to be up 8.5 percent from the fourth quarter of 2001.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest surprise in yesterday's results was the department stores, which were down 1.3 percent over all. Even though a negative number, it was better than analysts had predicted: down 2.2 percent. The better-than-expected average was caused largely by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, Mr. Perkins said.</p>
        <p>''Sears was down 4.6,'' he said, ''but we had expected close to 8.''</p>
        <p>Of the department stores that rose significantly, J.  C. Penney was up 4.7 percent and Nordstrom was up 3.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart Stores, the country's biggest retailer, came in at 2.3 percent -- the low end of its conservative projections. Talbot's, which analysts say needs to attract some new core customers, was down 9.1 percent. Wet Seal, an exception in the teenage sector, fell 19.1 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perkins at First Call said that the index for all discount chains, including Wal-Mart and Target -- for years, the bright spot -- rose only 2 percent. ''If they're not doing better than that, who is?'' he asked.</p>
