        <p>Ji Baek dresses more like a spa guest than a spa owner, even when she is working overtime. Next month, Ms. Baek, a 32-year-old manicurist who owns the Rescue Nail Spa as well as two Rescue Beauty Lounges in New York City, will come out with her own line of nail polishes. (They will become available next month at Fred Segal in Los Angeles.) Her packed schedule does not cramp her style. ''Comfort is not an issue for me,'' Ms. Baek said. ''I wear heels every day. I've been known to wear cocktail dresses at 10 in the morning.'' High heels may be the only constant element in Ms. Baek's personal style catalog. ''I love changing my look,'' Ms. Baek said. ''I'll be brushing my teeth and think: 'It's a preppy day. I'm going to wear a kilt and look like a schoolgirl.' '' This winter, Ms. Baek has been rotating creamy whites and ladylike yellows, as well as the pink ensemble shown here, which consists of a Smashing Grandpa tank top ($30 at www.rescuebeauty.com); Marc Jacobs cargo pants ($550 at Marc Jacobs, New York; 212-924-6126); and hot pink cashmere socks nestled into Prada pumps ($510 at Prada stores). A Chanel jacket ($2,080 at Chanel stores) and a hard-to-find Hermès Birkin bag add weight to the whimsy. ''Color intrigues me because that's my work,'' Ms. Baek said. ''I rarely wear all black.''</p>
