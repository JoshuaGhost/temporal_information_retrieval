        <p>'KILL BILL' -- Quentin Tarantino's first film in six years is an action revenge picture, set in China, about a bride (Uma Thurman) who is left for dead on her wedding day by a crime lord. It has whipped up a considerable amount of press, if only because Warren Beatty dropped out of the picture and was replaced by David Carradine. An unblushing embrace of the martial-arts cinema that Mr. Tarantino so loves, ''Kill Bill'' (opening in the fall) features one of the most formidable two-fisted movie icons of the 1970's, the Hong Kong film legend Sonny Chiba; another Asian throwdown specialist, Chia Hui Liu, and a group of equally idiosyncratic but more down-to-earth actors -- Vivica A. Fox, Samuel L. Jackson, Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah.</p>

        <p>'KILL BILL' -- Quentin Tarantino's first film in six years is an action revenge picture, set in China, about a bride (Uma Thurman) who is left for dead on her wedding day by a crime lord. It has whipped up a considerable amount of press, if only because Warren Beatty dropped out of the picture and was replaced by David Carradine.

Fox, Samuel L. Jackson, Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah.</p>
        <p>'THE MATRIX RELOADED' -- Finally, this spring, we'll get to see one of the two sequels to the most imitated collision of comic books, pop mythology and Hong Kong action-movie mechanics since the first series of ''Star Wars'' films. By the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, it's one of the most anticipated movies of the year, a story of terror and rebirth. Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, a virtual messiah reborn as a man of action. Also back are Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving and Carrie-Anne Moss, who has shown impressive progress as an actress.</p>
        <p>'COLD MOUNTAIN' -- The writer, director and film aesthete Anthony Minghella, whose previous films were ''The Talented Mr. Ripley,''  ''The English Patient,''  ''Mr. Wonderful'' and the undernoticed ''Truly, Madly, Deeply,'' adapts Charles Frazier's best-selling novel (set for a Christmas release). It's the story of a physically and psychically damaged Confederate soldier struggling to make his way home from the war -- apparently a very long way home, since the film was shot in Eastern Europe. Despite the unlikely location, Mr. Minghella's densely romantic and spiritual approach to storytelling, along with a cast that includes Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Rene√© Zellweger, Brendan Gleeson, Natalie Portman and Philip Seymour Hoffman, promises one of the richest screen experiences of the year.</p>
