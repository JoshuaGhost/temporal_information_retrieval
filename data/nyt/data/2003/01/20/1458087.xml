        <p>On some nights, when the game has ended at Continental Arena and his tired teammates scatter, Brian Scalabrine will make the short drive to the Nets' practice facility and take the court by himself to shoot.</p>
        <p>Scalabrine, a second-year forward from Southern California, tells this story and adds, pointing to the video room, ''I sleep in there sometimes.'' He quickly confesses, though, ''No, that's not true.''</p>
        <p>What is true is that, as the Nets head west for a challenging five-game trip, Scalabrine's role will be changing. With Rodney Rogers sidelined for the trip, and probably longer, with a strained left calf muscle, the little-used Scalabrine, a fan favorite, has become the Nets' first forward off the bench.</p>
        <p>He received his first test in the Nets' one-sided 88-77 victory over Toronto on Friday. He played a career-high 35 minutes (he was averaging 5.1 a game), resulting in a 2-for-10 shooting night and the teasing of teammates, who said he looked as if he were carrying a refrigerator by the end of the game.</p>
        <p>Despite the jokes, the team does have confidence in Scalabrine, who finished with 8 points and 4 rebounds against the Raptors. But the Nets think, as he does, that he is far more suited for a meaningful role than the garbage-time minutes he has been receiving.</p>
        <p>''I think the confidence was instilled just by me being out here,'' Scalabrine said. ''I'm always the first one in here. I try to work on my game all the time, and they see me out here doing it. So they figure if he's out here working, when he gets the chance, he'll definitely perform.''</p>
        <p>Coach Byron Scott called the 6-foot-9 Scalabrine ''one of the hardest-working guys I've ever been around.''</p>
        <p>''I mean, from Day 1 until the season's over,'' Scott said. ''He's a gym rat. He's in the weight room, he's on the floor. Whatever he feels he needs to work on or whatever he feels he can probably gain some type of advantage, that's what he's going to work on.''</p>
        <p>It is nothing new for Scalabrine. Before the 2001 N.B.A. draft, when he was traveling around the country for workouts with teams, he arrived in New Jersey from a long workout in Boston. While waiting for his appointment with the Nets' coaches, he tried to persuade the team's strength coach, Rich Dalatri, to allow him to lift weights. That notion was squashed by Dalatri, who wanted Scalabrine to rest.</p>
        <p>The Nets wound up drafting Scalabrine in the second round, 35th over all.</p>
        <p>Scalabrine's work habits appeal to Scott, who keeps long hours himself and regularly engages in shooting competitions that keep Scalabrine's stroke sharp and his wallet a bit lighter.</p>
        <p>''I come in early and I always beat him in,'' Scott said. ''But he's always the first guy that's in here. He's always telling me, 'I'll see you in the weight room tomorrow,' and I would be here at 9. He'll walk in at 9:30 and just shake his head. But again, he's here two and a half hours early, and then he does the weights, then he's on the floor, then he's doing all these drills on the floor with Rich to be in top condition and then he has practice. So I mean, he's just a workhorse. He's a guy that loves the game.''</p>
        <p>Still, all the drills in the world cannot prepare Scalabrine for the task at hand -- facing forwards like Karl Malone of the Jazz and Chris Webber of the Kings as the Nets navigate this trip, which tips off Monday night at Utah.</p>
        <p>''I'm not looking at it like this is my time to showcase my skills,'' Scalabrine said. ''I'm just looking at it like an opportunity to take advantage of. If you keep it in perspective, it's not that difficult. I've just got to go out there, run the offense, play some good defense and try to get some rebounds. It's not like I've got to carry the team.''</p>
        <p>Rogers said Scalabrine should not try to be anyone else in his new role.</p>
        <p>''He's got to do what got Scalabrine to U.S.C. and what got Scalabrine to the N.B.A., do that for the team and help us out,'' Rogers said. ''And he's been doing it. He's going to be a major factor right now. He can shoot the long ball, and he knows the offense better than anybody pretty much.''</p>
        <p>Scott agreed.</p>
        <p>''I think he's a very good player,'' Scott said. ''I think the only thing that's really holding him back is inexperience. He knows right now he's going to be the first forward off the bench, so he knows that he's going to get some playing time. He's a guy who I have a lot of confidence in.''</p>
