        <p>Words and Music  Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) didn't just keep a diary. He was an amateur composer, a singer and a keen observer of music in Restoration England; at 8 p.m. Friday at the Society for Ethical Culture, at 2 West 64th Street, he will be the inspiration for ''The Musical Life of Samuel Pepys.'' Presented by the New York Collegium, the evening will feature songs known to Pepys (including ''Beauty Retire'' by Pepys himself), as well as dramatized readings from his diary. The performance will be preceded by a screening of a recent conversation on Pepys between Andrew Parrott, music director of the Collegium, and Dr. Richard Luckett, curator of the Pepys Library at Cambridge University.</p>
        <p>Winners  The lighting designer Jennifer Tipton and the New York City Ballet have been named the first winners of the Jerome Robbins Prize for excellence in the dance arts. The awards of $100,000 each from the Jerome Robbins Foundation are to be presented tomorrow at the New York State Theater before an all-Robbins performance by the New York City Ballet with lighting by Ms. Tipton. . . . Exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art are among the winners of the annual awards of the United States section of the International Association of Art Critics. ''Gerhard Richter: 40 Years of Painting,'' organized by the Modern, with Robert Storr as curator, was named the best monographic museum show in New York City. Another Modern exhibition, ''Mies in Berlin,'' with Terence Riley and Barry Bergdoll as curators, was named best architecture or design show. The Whitney's ''Into the Light: The Projected Image, 1964-77,'' with Chrissie Iles as curator, was named best thematic museum show in New York.</p>
