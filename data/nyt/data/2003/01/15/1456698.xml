      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial finds it appropriate for Pres Bush to get involved in deciding administration's position on important case before Supreme Court, on University of Michigan's affirmative action admissions policies; hopes Bush will show commitment to moving Republican party into more positive positions on race issues</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>With the government's briefs due tomorrow, President Bush has become personally involved in deciding the administration's position on the two big affirmative action cases scheduled for argument in the Supreme Court in April.</p>
        <p>That is entirely appropriate. The two cases, which challenge the University of Michigan's use of race as a ''plus factor'' in undergraduate and law school admissions, have huge implications for the nation's efforts to widen racial equality and increase campus diversity by opening institutions of higher learning to more blacks and Hispanics. Moreover, in the aftermath of the Trent Lott embarrassment, the administration's stance will be seen as an indicator of the president's commitment to moving his party and the country beyond the segregationist past.</p>

        <p>With the government's briefs due tomorrow, President Bush has become personally involved in deciding the administration's position on the two big affirmative action cases scheduled for argument in the Supreme Court in April.</p>
        <p>That is entirely appropriate. The two cases, which challenge the University of Michigan's use of race as a ''plus factor'' in undergraduate and law school admissions, have huge implications for the nation's efforts to widen racial equality and increase campus diversity by opening institutions of higher learning to more blacks and Hispanics. Moreover, in the aftermath of the Trent Lott embarrassment, the administration's stance will be seen as an indicator of the president's commitment to moving his party and the country beyond the segregationist past.</p>
        <p>There are dismaying reports that Mr. Bush has asked the Justice Department to draft a brief opposing the university's affirmative action programs, which, like others used by admissions offices across the country, were crafted to comply with the Supreme Court's ruling in the 1978 Bakke case. The exact basis of the administration's opposition is unclear. But it would not be surprising if its brief were to argue that diversity can be achieved without explicitly taking race into account. If it does, it may cite a program in Mr. Bush's home state that requires the University of Texas to accept the top 10 percent of students from each graduating high school class.</p>
        <p>That approach is necessarily flawed since its success depends on perpetuating a system of largely segregated secondary schools. It also fails to address the need to keep up minority enrollment at the best private colleges and professional schools. A president who wants his administration to stand for racial inclusion will not go down this path.</p>
