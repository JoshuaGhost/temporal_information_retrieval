        <p>Like a ghost in a graveyard, a defensive back works best under cover of darkness. He flits and floats, undetected if possible, moving on the margins, dancing from hiding place to hiding place.</p>
        <p>On the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' defense, cornerback Ronde Barber is the resident ghoul, a sprite who never stands in the same place twice. Sometimes, he is a gust of wind, racing behind the quarterback and knocking the ball loose from an unsuspecting hand.</p>
        <p>Other times, he waits for his moment to pounce, leaping into the light for an interception and sprinting 92 yards for a touchdown, as Barber did in Tampa Bay's 27-10 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football Conference championship game Sunday.</p>
        <p>''We're good,'' Barber said of the Buccaneers' defense, its secondary and, really, himself. ''I'm not scared to admit it.''</p>
        <p>Surrounded by larger-than-life teammates (Warren Sapp and Keyshawn Johnson come to mind) and a coach whose face seems as pliable as putty, Barber is more subdued, not unlike his twin brother, Tiki, the Giants' running back who talks gently and runs with fury.</p>
        <p>But as Ronde Barber showed in Philadelphia, he is more than a warm body on the N.F.L.'s best defense. He is the electron with a mind of its own, a player who will bounce around the field during the Super Bowl and chase the Oakland Raiders' top receivers -- Jerry Rice, Tim Brown and Jerry Porter -- and, occasionally, fly through the line and stalk quarterback Rich Gannon.</p>
        <p>As the Buccaneers' defense showed against the Eagles, the more varied it is, the more dangerous it is. Man defense. Zone defense. Blitz. Straight up.</p>
        <p>''I've tried to say all along, Brett Favre, Garcia, all of the Pro Bowl quarterbacks, this defense is very hard,'' Buccaneers Coach Jon Gruden said. ''They can rush the quarterback and test you every play. That's the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>The defense's variety allowed Barber to end up in different spots on the field: the left side, the right side, beneath piles, over and around the Eagles' offensive line.</p>
        <p>Barber sacked Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb and forced a fumble on a blitz in the third quarter, after the Eagles had crept across midfield in search of a game-tying touchdown.</p>
        <p>Even when McNabb broke free of the pocket, the Buccaneers were fast enough to stay with him and his outlets. Tampa Bay looked as if it had 20 players against Eagles Coach Andy Reid's 11.</p>
        <p>''I have to give credit to their defense,'' Reid said. ''They put a lot of emphasis on stopping the run. We weren't really effective there.''</p>
        <p>McNabb said: ''They put eight guys in the box and they secured the tackles. They did a wonderful job of exchanging on some of our crossing routes. They were doing some different things.''</p>
        <p>Barber, who finished the game with three tackles and four passes defended, said his interception and 92-yard touchdown return of a McNabb pass, which closed out the Eagles in the fourth quarter, was successful because McNabb did not know what was coming.</p>
        <p>''I assume Donovan thought we were coming with the same deal,'' Barber said, referring to the blitz. ''He threw it right into the teeth of the defense. It was a play that I have to make.''</p>
        <p>McNabb, aware that Barber had blitzed before, said he thought Eagles receiver Antonio Freeman was open. But Barber was lurking in the shadows, and he cut in front of Freeman to steal the pass.</p>
        <p>''All of a sudden you see him running the other way,'' McNabb said. ''You don't believe that it's happening, but it actually is.''</p>
        <p>Raiders safety Rod Woodson made a play similar to Barber's during the regular season, when he stole a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback Brian Griese and ran 98 yards for a touchdown. It turned out to be a season-turning play for Oakland, whose record was 4-4 at the time.</p>
        <p>Barber has arguably raised his level of play from the regular season, when he had only two interceptions (as did Sapp). Against the San Francisco 49ers in the divisional playoffs, Barber picked off the Pro Bowl quarterback Jeff Garcia and returned the interception 25 yards in the Buccaneers' 31-6 demolition of the 49ers.</p>
        <p>''I think we get our due,'' Barber said. ''I'm not going to lie. We have great players on our team, and everybody knows we have great players. All we heard this week was how great the Eagles' secondary was, three guys going to the Pro Bowl, or whatever. It doesn't matter to us. We know we're the best out there and we prove it every week.''</p>
        <p>Barber may be hearing about the other team's secondary for one more week. About Rod Woodson, the future Hall of Fame safety on the Raiders. About Charles Woodson and Tory James, the tough-as-nails cornerbacks who run around and make plays with steel plates in their legs.</p>
        <p>''We've got something bigger we are looking for,'' Barber said. ''We are on a path of destiny and we don't want to mess it up. This is a must-have game because of that.''</p>
        <p>Barber will be wearing No. 20 on the Qualcomm Stadium field Sunday beneath the flashing bulbs at the kickoff and the glow of a Southern California afternoon.</p>
        <p>But you might not see him at first.</p>
