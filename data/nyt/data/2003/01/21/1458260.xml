        <p>A 25-year-old man who was arrested last week in the slaying of a college acquaintance on the Lower East Side and then released hours later is no longer a suspect, a police official and the man's lawyer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The man, Forrest Bloede, was initially arrested and charged in the killing of Burke O'Brien, who was shot once in the chest in the early hours of Jan. 12 in front of 75-79 Orchard Street. But the charges, which came after Mr. Bloede was questioned over a period of about 20 hours, were later dropped after supervisors at the Manhattan district attorney's office reviewed the case, investigators have said.

        <p>A 25-year-old man who was arrested last week in the slaying of a college acquaintance on the Lower East Side and then released hours later is no longer a suspect, a police official and the man's lawyer said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The man, Forrest Bloede, was initially arrested and charged in the killing of Burke O'Brien, who was shot once in the chest in the early hours of Jan. 12 in front of 75-79 Orchard Street. But the charges, which came after Mr. Bloede was questioned over a period of about 20 hours, were later dropped after supervisors at the Manhattan district attorney's office reviewed the case, investigators have said. Mr. Bloede was released.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloede (pronounced BLO-dee) and Mr. O'Brien, a Chicago native and a Colorado State University graduate who had recently arrived in the city to begin working for the Bank of America, were returning from a night out when Mr. O'Brien was shot shortly before 4 a.m. outside the apartment building where they were staying with friends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloede's arrest was based on the initial accounts of two witnesses who said the two men were alone, with one pointing something, possibly a gun, at the other, before a shot rang out, investigators have said. But the charges were dropped after those statements were determined to be insufficient to support the arrest and no credible motive could be found for Mr. Bloede to kill Mr. O'Brien, investigators have said. During a subsequent interview, one of the witnesses made statements that led investigators to believe that he may have seen the aftermath, rather than the shooting itself, and a third witness provided an account that supported Mr. Bloede's contention that Mr. Burke was shot by robbers, investigators said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloede's lawyer, Glenn A. Wolther, said yesterday that it was ''essential'' that his client's name be cleared, and he criticized the way the case was handled. ''Mistakes made by the D.A.'s office and the police in the early hours of the investigation wasted critical time,'' he said. ''Moreover, Forrest was subjected to hours of abusive interrogation and wrongly arrested just hours after watching his friend get shot and surviving an armed mugging himself.''</p>
        <p>A police spokesman said the department would have no comment and a spokeswoman for Robert M. Morganthau, the Manhattan district attorney, also declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Detectives on the Lower East Side recently began distributing fliers offering a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and indictment of Mr. Burke's killer. The fliers describe two assailants and ask anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS. The fliers say one of the assailants was a black or light-skinned 5-foot-11-inch Hispanic man who weighed 175 pounds and had a goatee. The other assailant is described as a dark-skinned black man from 5 feet 6 inches to 5 feet 8 inches tall, weighing 130 to 145 pounds. Mr. Bloede is white.</p>
