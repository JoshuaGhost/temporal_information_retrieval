        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The National Abortion Federation agrees with Peggy Loonan that now is the moment to be clear about what the pro-choice movement stands for (''Don't Compromise on Abortion,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 15). We represent abortion providers who risk their lives every day to provide safe reproductive health care services for women.</p>
        <p>Many of our members have witnessed the devastating consequences of illegal abortions before the Supreme Court's landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. They proudly offer abortion services to women because they know that what they do protects women's health and saves lives.</p>

        <p>We work to ensure that those who use violence to stop women from receiving abortion care are prosecuted and punished to the fullest extent of the law. When it comes to violence and a woman's right to choose, we cannot compromise.</p>
