        <p>The unemployment rate in Hong Kong crept up to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter, compared with a rate of 7.1 percent for the period from September through November. The number of jobless people dropped very slightly, but the labor force shrank more, pushing up the overall unemployment rate. Joblessness remained below last summer's peak of 7.8 percent, as the Hong Kong economy has begun to show signs of recovery, mainly from handling much of China's ever-rising volume of trade and outbound tourism. Employment fell over the last three months in restaurants and hotels, but rose in stores, construction and tourism.</p>
