        <p>A 3-year-old Rockland County boy was dragged to his death on Tuesday after the long string connecting his mittens became caught in the bus's closing door as he was getting off in front of his home, the authorities said yesterday. The bus continued to move, and the boy, Chaim U. Horovitz, was dragged more than 100 feet, officials said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>As local police and state transportation officials investigated, the boy's family -- one of many Hasidic families in the village of Monsey, N.Y. -- opened their home yesterday for seven days of mourning.</p>

        <p>A 3-year-old Rockland County boy was dragged to his death on Tuesday after the long string connecting his mittens became caught in the bus's closing door as he was getting off in front of his home, the authorities said yesterday. The bus continued to move, and the boy, Chaim U. Horovitz, was dragged more than 100 feet, officials said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>As local police and state transportation officials investigated, the boy's family -- one of many Hasidic families in the village of Monsey, N.Y. -- opened their home yesterday for seven days of mourning.</p>
        <p>Chaim was a nursery school student at Yeshiva Tzoin Yosef, a private school in Spring Valley where his father, Reuven, is a teacher, said State Assemblyman Ryan S. Karben, who paid a condolence call on the family. Reached at home, the family had no comment, but Mr. Karben said the Horovitzes, who have seven other children in what is normally a bustling household, were ''still, somber and unwilling to accept what happened.''</p>
        <p>Sgt. Brian Corbett, of the Ramapo police, said yesterday that ''the whole thing is under investigation,'' including the role of the bus driver, Boris Shnitzer, 70, of Spring Valley, and the bus monitor, Tobias Daskalovic, 28, who the police said stood outside the bus as the children got off.</p>
        <p>The bus has been impounded by the State Department of Transportation. Colleen McKenna, a spokeswoman for the department's Hudson Valley Region, said the bus was being inspected for mechanical flaws and a report would be released to the police, probably on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McKenna said that bus drivers from both private and public schools with passengers age 5 or older must be certified by the state's Division of Motor Vehicles, but not those with passengers under 5.</p>
        <p>The school released a statement saying the bus was ''in perfect running order and was in full compliance with all New York State Department of Transportation regulations for school buses, and was licensed as such.''</p>
