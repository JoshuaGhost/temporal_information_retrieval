      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Hip &amp; Humble Home, a large furniture store that opened in Chelsea last month, is jam-packed with teak, mainly from Indonesia. Much of the furniture is colonial style and hand hewn. Benches ($895 to $2,295) and dining tables ($1,795 to $2,295) are vintage; armoires ($1,795 to $4,800) are newly made but of old wood, many with shelves for televisions. Wood table lamps with damask shades, above, are made in New York ($195), colorful poufs (inset above) in patterned fabrics come from Morocco ($110), and accessories like wood and metal candlesticks come from India. Hip &amp; Humble Home, 143 West 19th Street, (212) 675-1527.</p>
