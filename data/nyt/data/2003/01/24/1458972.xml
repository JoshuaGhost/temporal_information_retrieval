        <p>A ''forest of columns'' designed to support the Pentagon when it was built 60 years ago saved thousands of people who would otherwise have died when terrorists attacked it with a hijacked airliner on Sept. 11, 2001, an expert panel said in a report released today.</p>
        <p>The study, sponsored by the American Society of Civil Engineers, said the sturdiness of the building and the closely spaced columns of reinforced concrete greatly limited the damage from the crash.</p>
        <p>A team of six prominent structural engineers took seven months reviewing damage done by the attack to find out how better to protect existing and future buildings from similar assaults. The panel reviewed the original plans for the Pentagon, studied renovations that were under way at the time of the attack and analyzed aircraft data and eyewitness accounts.</p>
        <p>''Based on analysis of this data, the team concluded that the Pentagon's resilient structural system, designed some 60 years ago, clearly mitigated the casualties and damage that resulted from the impact and fire,'' Paul F. Mlakar, the team leader, said at a Pentagon news conference.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mlakar, a technical director with the Army Corps of Engineers, credited the steel-reinforced columns, spaced about 20 feet apart, and the slab floors supported by a crisscross beam-and-girder system that helped spread excess loads from collapsed supports.</p>
        <p>By contrast, the World Trade Center, where nearly 3,000 people died on Sept. 11, had open floors with few columns, and walls made of glass and lightweight steel.</p>
        <p>The plane that struck the Pentagon penetrated the five-story building between its first and second floors, sending a wave of debris and fuel 310 feet into the structure. Although the impact destroyed almost 50 columns on the first floor and damaged others, the panel found, only a relatively small part of the building collapsed after being weakened by fire.</p>
        <p>''The entire aircraft disintegrated rapidly as it moved through the forest of columns on the first floor,'' Dr. Mlakar said. ''The debris likely resembled a rapidly moving avalanche through the first floor of the building.''</p>
        <p>The attack killed 125 military and civilian workers in the building and all 64 people aboard the American Airlines Boeing 757. Most of the deaths occurred in the immediate impact area, and thousands had a chance to escape because so little of the building collapsed and fire from the burning fuel and building contents was confined by the structure.</p>
        <p>''We had limited localized damage to part of the structural frame, we had collapse only in that limited area,'' Dr. Mlakar said.</p>
        <p>He added that the report provided important information for the construction industry on safeguarding not only against terrorist attacks but also against natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes. The key, he said, is to confine any collapse within a structure to relatively small areas.</p>
        <p>The panel said the study validated several measures that industry could use to reduce collapses, including extending floor reinforcements through structural supports instead of just attaching them; adding more redundancy, like floor framing that supports in two directions instead of one; and reinforcing concrete columns internally with spirals of steel bands that wrap around them, like those in the Pentagon, instead of straight rods, as is now common.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's chief designer was Lt. Gen. Brehon Burke Somervell, the Army's chief of construction in World War II, whose idea was to place the nation's military establishment under one roof. The architect was George Bergstrom.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon study was completed months ago, but its release was delayed by the Defense Department in a classification review. The military, concerned that a study outlining the strengths and weaknesses of its headquarters might compromise security, withdrew draft copies of the report that were being reviewed by researchers, spurring concerns that it would not be publicly released.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mlakar said the report as released today lacked no information that would be useful to the building industry. Certain details concerning the building itself will not be divulged because they could compromise security, he said.</p>
        <p>''The Pentagon remains a target and there are legitimate security issues,'' Dr. Mlakar said.</p>
        <p>The expert panel also said damage at the Pentagon was confined, and more lives saved, by renovations begun in 1999 to improve security. The plane hit the building on the side that had already been reinforced, and the improvements blunted its affects, said Michael Sullivan, acting program manager of the Pentagon Renovation Program.</p>
        <p>The modification program for the entire building is continuing, Mr. Sullivan said, but it is focusing on protecting people rather than structural reinforcement.</p>
