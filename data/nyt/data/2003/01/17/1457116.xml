      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Audi's new A8 sedan responds to a light touch -- literally. The console on certain models of this aluminum-bodied luxury car incorporates a device that recognizes the driver's fingerprints. It then responds with an individual adjustment of several controls, like radio presets or the position of the seat, steering column and mirror. It can even adjust the automatic transmission -- to stay in low gears longer for high performance driving, for example, or to shift faster for fuel economy.</p>
        <p>The fingerprint sensor, seemingly worthy of the front door of an F.B.I. office, is a postage-stamp-size pad located on the starter button. Using 24 fingerprint characteristics stored in its digital memory, it compares the fingerprint of the person pressing the button with the owner's, also stored in its digital memory. If the driver passes the test, the stored presets come into play.</p>

If the driver passes the test, the stored presets come into play.</p>
        <p>The sensor can also unlock a personal address book with up to 100 entries and even engages a personal program on the car's satellite navigation system. It is capable of remembering and recognizing up to 60 fingerprints, allowing the owner to let other drivers use the features.</p>
        <p>So far, the system is available only on some European models of the A8, but the company hopes to add it soon to models sold in the United States.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, American buyers will have to make do with the similar, though more limited, device that some automakers add to the key fob. It expands the function of the familiar key-based system that unlocks cars from a few feet away so that it also activates a few presets, like the seat position.</p>
