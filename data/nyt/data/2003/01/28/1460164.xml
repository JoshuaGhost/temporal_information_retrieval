        <p>In a preliminary finding, the Bush administration ruled that Vietnamese catfish farmers are guilty of dumping discount-priced frozen fish on the market in the United States and could be liable for import duties as high as 63 percent. In what is becoming a major trade war, American catfish farmers have persuaded Congress to bar Vietnam from using the name catfish for their exports and then filed the suit that led to yesterday's decision by the Commerce Department. For their part, the Vietnamese have condemned the suit as ''an unfair, protectionist act'' and a violation of the new trade agreement with the United States. They said their fish were priced lower because Vietnamese labor costs far less than American labor. In the last three years, Vietnamese catfish exports have soared from $13 million to $55 million, capturing 20 percent of the American market. A final decision is expected in June.</p>
