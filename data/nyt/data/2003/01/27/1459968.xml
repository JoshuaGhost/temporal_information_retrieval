      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Jaron Friedman, a senior at Boston University, has done his time in the traditional dormitory double: a 180-square-foot box with a stranger in the next bed -- his video-game-addicted sophomore roommate was ''probably one of the worst roommates anyone on this campus has ever had'' -- and a bathroom down the hall shared by 24 underclassmen.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Friedman says, ''I want my own bedroom, my own bathroom, my own space.''</p>
        <p>Boston University, which is trying to keep students on campus, is eager to give Mr. Friedman what he wants. This year he is in the $81 million high-rise apartment the university opened two years ago overlooking the Charles River. The 817 juniors and seniors in residence, men and women, all have their own bedrooms, in four-bedroom apartments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman does share a bathroom with one of his three suitemates, but he is hardly complaining. The 1,200-square-foot apartment has two bathrooms -- and a kitchen and oversized dining/living room (with spectacular views of Boston and Cambridge). All this costs Mr. Friedman $8,680 a year (on top of the $27,042 tuition), about $1,400 more than student housing where he would share a bedroom and considerably less than a similar apartment off campus. Mr. Friedman says the privacy is worth every penny.</p>
        <p>The roommate, a source of vivid memories for generations of former students, is no longer the staple of campus life it once was.</p>
        <p>Students like Mr. Friedman, who grew up with their own bedrooms in the prosperous 1990's, are increasingly demanding -- and willingly paying for -- the same privacy they had at home.</p>
        <p>Colleges have always offered single rooms, and students have long moved off campus in search of greater privacy. But for the last decade, colleges across the country, in a high-priced competition for students who may be just as concerned with residential amenities as they are with the number of volumes in the library, have been responding by creating housing in which the single bedroom is the mainstay.</p>
        <p>College administrators say they feel compelled, in part, to create more singles to keep students, mainly upperclassmen, on campus, where they will be more engaged in college life. In addition, the revenue that would go to private landlords is attractive.</p>
        <p>The new buildings are called residence halls or even living/learning centers. (Do not call them dorms; to housing officials and builders, the term is as obsolete as the dorm mother or the telephone down the hall.) Students often live in suites, where they share living rooms and, sometimes, kitchens, but can retreat to their own bedrooms, with their own computers, television sets, DVD players and telephones.</p>
        <p>''It's a statement about the affluence of America,'' said William Rawn, a Boston architect who is building residence halls, many of them with single bedrooms, at Northeastern University here in Boston, Trinity College in Hartford, Amherst, Swarthmore and Grinnell College, in Iowa. ''And part of that affluence is that we lose the ability to share.''</p>
        <p>College administrators, already concerned about the effect of technology on community life, say they worry that the new emphasis on single bedrooms will give students one more reason to hole up alone in their rooms.</p>
        <p>Some colleges are resisting the trend. Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, a new institution in Needham, Mass., opened its first student residence last summer with all double rooms.</p>
        <p>''There is concern among college officials nationwide that as colleges have moved to more and more single rooms that students are interacting with fewer and fewer people in the hall,'' said Sharon Herzberger, vice president of student life at Trinity College, which three years ago opened two new residence halls with all single bedrooms. ''This is exacerbated by the fact that students can now watch DVD's on their computer screens. It used to be that people would congregate down the hall in the lounge and watch TV and make popcorn as a study break. Now you can do all that in your own room.''</p>
        <p>It generally costs more -- at least 25 percent more per bed, according to Mr. Rawn's estimates -- to build residences with singles instead of doubles. While some colleges, like Trinity, charge students the same for singles as doubles (at Trinity the annual housing cost is $4,746), these costs inevitably mean higher housing fees, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rawn recalled the opening of his first student residence, at Bates College in Maine, in 1993. He had designed the building with mostly four-person suites, each with two shared bedrooms. One mother came up to him, he said, and demanded: ''How can you design a dorm where kids have to share a bedroom? My daughter has never shared a bedroom in her life.''</p>
        <p>''I told her, I went to a rather well-known college,'' said Mr. Rawn, who graduated from Yale in 1965, ''and I shared a bedroom all the way through.'' (He and his roommate, Ed Townsend, who slept on bunk beds in a 112-square-foot room in a suite at Yale's Saybrook College, are still best friends, Mr. Rawn says.)</p>
        <p>''It never dawned on me that this was a problem,'' Mr. Rawn said.</p>
        <p>The only time Mr. Friedman shared a bedroom at home in Orange, Conn., was during a brief period when he was 7, he said, and his 4-year-old brother, upset over their parents' divorce, wanted to bunk with him (''When I go into his room now, he throws me out,'' Mr. Friedman said.) Mr. Friedman's three suitemates, who all happen to be only children, all had their own bedrooms too.</p>
        <p>Norbert Dunkel, the director of housing at the University of Florida, has studied college housing across the country and has also noticed the prevalence of students who grew up with their own bedrooms. Ask 300 freshmen at a summer orientation how many of them have shared bedrooms at home, he said, ''and you might get 20 hands.''</p>
        <p>''Many had their own bathrooms, too,'' Mr. Dunkel said.</p>
        <p>Even twin beds are considered obsolete by many students. One of Mr. Friedman's suitemates, Ken Bukoski, grew up sleeping on a queen-sized bed. ''I have friends with king-sized beds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bukoski, who is 6 feet 3, has had to adjust to the twin-sized beds at Boston University. For all the amenities of his new high rise -- central air-conditioning, a fancy fitness facility, a penthouse student lounge -- twin-sized beds are still the only option.</p>
        <p>But Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland is building a residence for juniors and seniors with 700 single rooms -- all of them with double beds. ''They're looking for amenities, and double beds was one of them,'' said Don Kamalsky, the director of student housing.</p>
        <p>Changing attitudes toward sex also have led students to insist on their own bedrooms, Mr. Rawn says. ''There's a lot of cohabitation,'' he said. ''That privacy is very important to the students.''</p>
        <p>Rebecca Hoskins, a 21-year-old nursing student, has a single bedroom in an apartment in Mr. Rawn's new high-rise on Northeastern's campus, not far from Boston University. ''It is convenient that you don't get sex-exiled for the weekend,'' she said, referring to students who are banished from their rooms when their roommate's boyfriend or girlfriend spends the night.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Hoskins, who works as a nursing assistant and a baby sitter to pay her quarterly $2,575 rent, describes the most important perk of her single bedroom as this, ''I love the fact that I can close that door, and it's my space.''</p>
        <p>Having a roommate remains a rite of passage for the vast majority of freshmen and, now more than ever, college administrators emphasize the importance of communal living for students.</p>
        <p>''A bunch of our students are scientists; they're going to work in labs where they will have to share, and work cooperatively,'' said Myrt Westphal, the director of residential life at Swarthmore College, which emphasizes community, and where all freshmen and most sophomores still live in doubles. ''The work world is cooperative. If you live with a partner, it's a cooperative venture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rawn has designed a new residence for Swarthmore with a mix of single and double bedrooms along hallways (with Mr. Rawn deciding, after careful study, the ideal width for maximum mingling, seven to seven and a half feet). The college resisted the architect's initial suggestion of suites, Ms. Westphal said, fearing the suites would encourage small cliques.</p>
        <p>At Boston University the other night, Caryn Lean, 19, and her roommate, Kaitlyn Cuneo, 18, both freshmen and members of the lacrosse team, were relaxing in their tiny room at Sleeper Hall -- Mr. Friedman's old dorm -- after lacrosse practice. They were sharing a pizza with two other lacrosse players.</p>
        <p>One of them, Kathryn Dahm, 18, was talking about the advantage of having a roommate. ''I have a random thought,'' Ms. Dahm said, ''and instead of calling someone to talk about it, I just say to my roommate, 'Hey, have you ever thought of that?' '' And her roommate, she said, turns out to have had the exact same random thought.</p>
        <p>They all get along so well, Ms. Lean said, that next year four of them plan to get their own apartment. But next year, she said, there will be an important change. They all plan on having separate bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 30, 2003, Thursday  A front-page article on Monday about a growing demand for private bedrooms in college housing referred incorrectly to the finances of Rebecca Hoskins, a student at Northeastern. She uses money from part-time jobs to pay for tuition, not for rent on a private room. As a resident assistant, she receives free room and board.</p>
