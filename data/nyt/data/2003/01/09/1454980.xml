        <p>Oddly, ''Freedom: A History of US,'' 16 episodes charting the nation's pursuit of liberty from Bunker Hill to the World Trade Center attack, does not address the last enslaved American institution: PBS.</p>
        <p>Didactic, worthy and irritatingly timid, the ''Freedom'' documentary, which begins on Sunday night, signals that at long last the time has come to consider privatizing public television or turning it over to the state. When a network dedicated to serving the public interest is tethered by both government financing and corporate largesse, the result is, well, ''Freedom: A History of US.''</p>

        <p>Oddly, ''Freedom: A History of US,'' 16 episodes charting the nation's pursuit of liberty from Bunker Hill to the World Trade Center attack, does not address the last enslaved American institution: PBS.</p>
        <p>Didactic, worthy and irritatingly timid, the ''Freedom'' documentary, which begins on Sunday night, signals that at long last the time has come to consider privatizing public television or turning it over to the state. When a network dedicated to serving the public interest is tethered by both government financing and corporate largesse, the result is, well, ''Freedom: A History of US.''</p>
        <p>The problem is not that the series is boring. ''Freedom,'' does not dare to be boring enough. Its creators felt compelled to fluff up this simple, child-friendly look at American history with celebrity voice-overs (Tom Hanks as Lincoln, Brad Pitt as James K. Polk). And that is because public television is not allowed to be commercial, but it is expected to be popular -- a conundrum that leads directly to PBS pledge drive concerts featuring Yanni, John Tesh and the Celtic Tenors.</p>
        <p>It is less obvious why PBS cannot be as painfully dull as it wants (though it didn't hold back last week: ''Frontline'' devoted an hour to whether someone else really wrote Shakespeare's plays). Now and then it should startle us with an imaginative, unsparing and counterintuitive look at a subject that commercial television would never address.</p>
        <p>''Freedom'' does neither. Instead, it falls into that all too frequent PBS category of commendable public television shows that one does not want to watch but thinks others should.</p>
        <p>The project was brought to PBS by a family of accomplished documentary filmmakers, Philip B. Kunhardt III; his father, Philip Jr.; and son, Peter W., and their partner, Nancy Steiner, a former NBC producer. The Kunhardts, whose previous works for PBS include a 10-part series on the American presidency, based this series on the popular history textbooks by Joy Hakim. Soon after Sept. 11 General Electric signed on as the sole corporate sponsor -- the sober patriotism was ideally suited to the mood of the nation. Katie Couric, the co-anchor of NBC's ''Today'' show, who before 9/11 had agreed to be the series's host, proved an ideal choice for G.E., which owns NBC.</p>
        <p>As a theme, ''Freedom'' is unassailable and even safer than motherhood, which can, of course, seem sexist. The series takes a solemn, self-congratulatory look at the American experience -- with regular pangs of contrition for injustices against women, blacks and American Indians.</p>
        <p>Some segments may cover ground not all schoolchildren or parents are familiar with: John Muir (Sean Connery), the turn-of-the-century environmentalist, or ''Appleton's Journal'' (with Julia Roberts), a periodical that announced plans for the Statue of Liberty. But the telling is very familiar to PBS veterans -- lots of Ken Burns-style black-and-white photographs and mournful banjo music.</p>
        <p>There are some distinctive grace notes along the way. The theme song, ''I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free,'' sung by Nina Simone, is lovely. Most of the visual material, especially old news footage, is artfully chosen and, especially in segments dealing with the civil rights movement, goes beyond the classic stock images that television has emblazoned in our minds. One memorable black-and-white shot of a boy, watching from a tree above a crowd listening to Martin Luther King, evokes the moment in a fresh way. So do shots of the scuffed shoes of blacks walking to work and church during the 1955 Montgomery, Ala., bus boycott.</p>
        <p>The best moments in fact are found in the Civil War and civil rights segments, subjects that PBS has already covered well and extensively.</p>
        <p>The worst moments come in the final episode, when the filmmakers try to tie the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 into their theme. While it may be perfectly reasonable for President Bush, in a stump speech, to blame Islamic terrorism on enemies who ''hate our freedom,'' it is a bit thin to rely on this assertion alone in a 16-part look at American social history. Whatever grievances are harbored by Islamic fundamentalists, it is hard to believe that the Bill of Rights tops the list.</p>
        <p>Sept. 11 would fit in smoothly in a 16-part series about the United States as the last superpower. Here, it feels forced. The writers try to wedge the connection in further with a quick reference to how the battle against terrorism could impinge on civil rights.</p>
        <p>The show basks in a glow of good intentions. The president and Laura Bush give their blessings to the series in the first episode. ''Ours is a history of heroic deeds performed on behalf of human liberty,'' Mrs. Bush tells the camera.</p>
        <p>Then G.E. gives its blessing. The PBS distinction between ''underwriters'' and commerical sponsors is increasingly blurry. The pompous black-and-white corporate ads for G.E. that precede each segment are almost indistinguishable from the series itself. Wouldbe historical footage of the first light bulb, an electric oven, a rocket taking off, an X-ray and a sonogram flash across the scene with hypnotizing speed. ''Over the years, we've been proud to present the world some amazing things,'' a deep baritone declares, ''including the program you will see tonight.''</p>
        <p>Corporations are increasingly reluctant to finance programming that is not somehow linked to their fields: Exxon just pulled out of ''Masterpiece Theater'' after 32 years, saying it wanted to use its money for environmental and health projects. It apparently felt that those causes would better offset negative images of the oil industry than would ''The Forsyte Saga.''</p>
        <p>G.E. provided three-quarters of the series's $4 million budget. Foundations that gave less money get a more perfunctory written credit.</p>
