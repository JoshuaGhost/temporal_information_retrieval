      <block class="full_text">
        <p>For 1,300 years the Akshobhya Buddha, one of four large statues of Buddha at the Four Gate Pagoda in China's Shandong Province, sat solemnly looking eastward, face locked in a beatific expression.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the Buddha lost its head. A gang of thieves, staging the second of two robbery attempts, swaddled the head in blankets and cut its throat with a diamond saw. Next, wielding a sledgehammer, they literally knocked it off its torso.</p>
        <p>The thieves were caught soon afterward and the ringleader was sentenced to life in prison, but the trail of the 159-pound head itself went cold. The Four Gate Pagoda, built in 611 during the Sui dynasty as part of the Shentong Monastery, was closed to the public as the Chinese government dealt with this embarrassing blow to its efforts to protect a site that had long been a top priority for historic preservation.</p>
        <p>That might have been the end of yet another dispiriting tale of cultural vandalism, a plague that has struck China just as it has many other countries. But then, in February 2002, the head of the Akshobhya Buddha turned up in Taiwan, the gift of loyal disciples to the Buddhist master Sheng-yen, the 73-year-old founder of the Dharma Drum Mountain Buddhist Association, based in Taiwan, and also of the Chan Meditation Center in Elmhurst, Queens.</p>
        <p>Alarmed by the gash in the Buddha's neck, Master Sheng-yen started an investigation. ''If there is a head, there must be a torso,'' was his first thought, as he later described it.</p>
        <p>He summoned Lin Bao Yao, a scholar at the Taipei National University of Arts, who studied the piece and traced it to Shandong Province in eastern China, and to the Sui dynasty, a precursor to the illustrious Tang dynasty. Experts from Shandong Province were able to confirm that this was the Akshobhya Buddha from the Four Gate Pagoda.</p>
        <p>Apparently the discovery was something of a shock for inhabitants of the region, who were never told back in 1997 that one of their Buddhas was missing its head.</p>
        <p>The scholarly police work was a stroke of luck for the Akshobhya Buddha, whose name in Sanskrit means ''imperturbable.'' For Master Sheng-yen, whose worldwide movement of a reported one million disciples is dedicated to the protection of the spiritual environment, it was, as he said later, like ''winning the lottery.''</p>
        <p>''I was so happy,'' said Master Sheng-yen, who was born in China but since 1978 has lived mostly in New York and has opened a retreat in Pine Bush, upstate. ''If it had not been presented to us as a gift, maybe it would have been another 200 years before it went back to its place of origins.''</p>
        <p>On Dec. 17, in a ceremony that cast a faint but warm glow on the otherwise frosty relations between Taiwan and the People's Republic, the Akshobhya Buddha was solemnly returned to its torso -- this time affixed to the shoulders by a steel rod, in part to prevent future thefts. The event was front-page news on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.</p>
        <p>Experts say that antiquities theft in China surfaced as a widespread problem only in the last 20 years, as local inhabitants learned of the value of ancient objects, some excavated illegally and some taken from their own homes. He Shuzhong of the National Administration on Cultural Heritage in Beijing said in a recent article that the route for smuggled antiquities passes through most large Chinese cities, with Hong Kong considered the main staging area.</p>
        <p>''It is an issue of concern,'' Master Sheng-yen said. ''The main problem is poverty, of course, but another problem is attitude, which is why it is so important to educate people.''</p>
        <p>Master Sheng-yen, who was awarded an honorary certificate by the Four Gate Pagoda Scenery Spot Preservation Committee for his act, made a point of traveling with the head on the plane and then the bus that returned it home, turning down an offer of his own limousine.</p>
        <p>On the same trip, Master Sheng-yen visited the National Religion Bureau in Beijing, where he suggested that the Four Gate Pagoda -- which under China's Communist government has largely been a tourist site -- should again become a religious shrine, as was intended when it was built by the monks who helped bring Buddhism to China from India, via central Asia.</p>
        <p>The return of the Buddha, he said, was not just a cultural event but part of a dialogue that is the core of Buddhist faith and belief.</p>
        <p>''As a religious leader, I believe I have played a role as a bridge between the two sides, in helping the interaction in a civilian way,'' he said, speaking through a translator. Both governments were supportive of the transfer, he added.</p>
        <p>Restoring the integrity of the original statue, with its distinctly Oriental features -- representative of a short, transitional period in Chinese Buddhist art -- was more important than keeping it in Taiwan at his center for the teaching of Buddhism, he said.</p>
        <p>The head had originally been bought by a group of Taiwanese businessmen, who wanted to donate it to Dharma Drum Mountain for its future Museum of Buddhist History and Culture. No one has yet figured out where the head was in the years after it was stolen, although Master Sheng-yen said several local officials lost their jobs after the theft was discovered.</p>
        <p>He said some experts had suggested that the head went from China to Japan and from there to art markets in Europe and then to Taiwan, where it was handled by a local antiquities dealer. It is not known whether the dealer has been questioned by the authorities.</p>
        <p>The dealer said he knew nothing about the head's origins, Master Sheng-yen said. Apparently, the head of the Akshobhya Buddha was singled out because the other Buddhas in the pagoda had been damaged. ''This one was the best preserved,'' Master Sheng-yen said.</p>
        <p>So far, Master Sheng-yen said, he has not been able to find out from his disciples how much they paid for the head, but he said he had heard estimates as high as $1.5 million. Experts on Buddhist art said that sculpture from the Sui (pronounced sway) dynasty was rare, since it lasted only from 581 to 618, but that prices could vary considerably.</p>
