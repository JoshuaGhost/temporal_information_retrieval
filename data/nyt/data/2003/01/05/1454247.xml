        <p>In the week before the Jets faced the Indianapolis Colts today, Coach Herman Edwards cautioned his players about how difficult it was for a team to win its first playoff game. But only moments after the Jets made the playoffs last Sunday by defeating the Green Bay Packers, several players mentioned that, despite the team's 2-5 start, the Jets were not content merely to have made the postseason, as they were last season. This time, they were determined to go further, to fulfill the preseason predictions of greatness.</p>
        <p>Today, they made Edwards look like a worrywart, and made the rest of the league gasp, dominating the Colts in a 41-0 victory that sends the Jets to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since the 1998 season, when they went to the American Football Conference championship game. It was the Jets' widest victory margin in a playoff game, and the first shutout in Jets playoff history.</p>

        <p>In the week before the Jets faced the Indianapolis Colts today, Coach Herman Edwards cautioned his players about how difficult it was for a team to win its first playoff game. But only moments after the Jets made the playoffs last Sunday by defeating the Green Bay Packers, several players mentioned that, despite the team's 2-5 start, the Jets were not content merely to have made the postseason, as they were last season. This time, they were determined to go further, to fulfill the preseason predictions of greatness.</p>
        <p>Today, they made Edwards look like a worrywart, and made the rest of the league gasp, dominating the Colts in a 41-0 victory that sends the Jets to the second round of the playoffs for the first time since the 1998 season, when they went to the American Football Conference championship game. It was the Jets' widest victory margin in a playoff game, and the first shutout in Jets playoff history.</p>
        <p>How good did the Jets look? Curtis Martin said they were playing better than the 1996 New England Patriots, with whom Martin went to the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>''They messed up and let us in,'' guard Dave Szott said. ''We're playing our best football right now. We're not intimidated by anyone.''</p>
        <p>If Pittsburgh beats Cleveland on Sunday, the Jets will play the Raiders, the top-seeded team in the A.F.C., in Oakland next weekend. That would be the fourth time the Jets have played the Raiders in Oakland in their last 20 games. If the Browns upset the Steelers, the Jets would play in Nashville against the Tennessee Titans, the only team that is as hot as they are.</p>
        <p>But if the Jets continue to play the way they did today, it will not matter who their opponent is. They have won their last three games -- against last season's Super Bowl champion, the Patriots, and two playoff teams -- by a combined score of 113-34, and this game, against what was supposed to be a high-powered offense, was startlingly lopsided.</p>
        <p>The statistics were telling. The Jets had 26 first downs to the Colts' 10. The Jets rang up 396 total yards, while the Colts had 176. The Jets rushed for 189 yards to the Colts' 52. Chad Pennington was 19 of 25 (with completions to nine different receivers) for 222 yards, 3 touchdowns and an outstanding quarterback rating of 142. He has not thrown an interception in five games, and his play has been so superb that he is starting to be asked questions about comparisons to Joe Montana. Peyton Manning, who has lost all three playoff games in his career, was 14 of 31 for 137 yards, with 2 interceptions.</p>
        <p>The score at halftime was 24-0. The Jets blew an 18-point lead to lose to Cleveland earlier in the season, but that now seems like a long time ago.</p>
        <p>The Colts finished the regular season with the 10th-ranked offense in the league, and the fourth-ranked passing game, but the Jets' defense used disguises befitting a cat burglar to flummox Manning, who endured his first shutout as a pro.</p>
        <p>Manning frequently calls audibles at the line of scrimmage, and the Jets wanted to upset that routine by showing blitzes and then backing off, coming out in one front and then switching to another. The Jets' strategy was successful. Four of the Colts' 10 drives ended after just three plays and no first downs. They ventured into Jets' territory only three times, and those drives ended with a missed 41-yard field-goal attempt in the first quarter and two fourth-quarter interceptions. The Colts had the ball for only 19 minutes 42 seconds.</p>
        <p>Linebacker James Darling said it was the best the Jets' defense has used disguises all season. Ted Cottrell, the defensive coordinator, said it was clear that Manning grew disgusted.</p>
        <p>''We dominated on all cylinders,'' said defensive tackle Josh Evans, who was instrumental in maintaining pressure on Manning. ''We got turnovers, we got pressure. We wanted to get to the quarterback and keep hitting him. We'd go to the line and he'd be so confused. The offensive linemen would be saying, 'Who am I blocking?' ''</p>
        <p>While the Jets have been befuddling offenses, their offense has become stunningly explosive. In the last three games, it has been in the red zone 14 times and has scored 12 touchdowns. Today, the Jets scored on their first three possessions and failed to score on only one of their first-half drives.</p>
        <p>The first drive was a barometer of where this game was headed. The Jets began at their 23-yard line, and they were concerned about the pass rush, particularly from the rookie Dwight Freeney. The Jets blocked Freeney outside. Martin pulled off a great fake and the linebackers bit. That allowed Pennington to flip the ball to Richie Anderson on the left side, where he scampered untouched for a 56-yard touchdown.</p>
        <p>''The convoy was out in front better than we ever anticipated because all of the linebackers had taken the fake,'' said Paul Hackett, the offensive coordinator. ''The screen pass put them on their heels, and once it got to 17-0, it takes the pressure off.''</p>
        <p>After that touchdown, the Jets scored on a 41-yard field goal by John Hall, two 1-yard runs by LaMont Jordan, a 4-yard pass from Pennington to Santana Moss, a 39-yard field goal and a 3-yard pass to the rookie tight end Chris Baker.</p>
        <p>They scored 14 points off two Colts turnovers (one was a fumble on a kickoff return). An interception provided a merciful ending to the game.</p>
        <p>The Jets, only three weeks removed from their 20-13 clunker against the Chicago Bears, insisted they can play better than they did today. For a team that barely got into the playoffs and is desperate to improve the image of a franchise that aches for success, this turn of fortune suggests there is even more magic to be wrung from this season. For their next opponent, the caliber of the Jets' play brings only a shiver.</p>
        <p>''Every time you do something around here, you're either trying to kill a ghost or trying not to be a ghost,'' Edwards said. ''Today, we killed a ghost.''</p>
        <p>And buried the Colts.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>LAVERANUES COLES, who caught 4 passes for 36 yards, had X-rays on his left hand taken after the game, but the results will not be known until Sunday. . . . The new grass that was laid in Giants Stadium on Tuesday was mushy after a day of freezing rain. During the second quarter, Coach HERMAN EDWARDS ran onto the field to replace a divot. In the third quarter, KEVIN MAWAE looked more like a groundskeeper, tossing divots aside. . . . The crowd of 78,524 was the second largest in Jets home playoff history. The record, 78,817, was set against Jacksonville in 1999.</p>
