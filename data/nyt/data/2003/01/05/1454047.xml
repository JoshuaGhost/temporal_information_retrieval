        <p>REINVENTION is the mother of necessity when an automaker is in trouble, and the path to renewal often leads to the corporate history books.</p>
        <p>Words like ''rediscovery'' and ''heritage'' will be heard a lot at the Los Angeles auto show, which opened yesterday and runs through Jan. 12, and at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where press previews start today and the doors open to the public on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Ford Motor Company celebrates its 100th anniversary this year after suffering huge financial losses, persistent quality problems and management upheavals. At this year's auto shows, Ford will mark its milestone by trying to show that it is recreating itself for its second century.</p>
        <p>In Detroit, Ford will show a concept car -- a design study that tests new ideas and styles -- called the Model U. Ford says the U builds on the heritage of the Model T by demonstrating how cars could be reinvented, along with their manufacturing processes and how they relate to the environment. Powering the Model U is what Ford calls the world's first supercharged internal combustion engine to run on hydrogen; the U would achieve the equivalent of 45 m.p.g. in a gasoline-powered car, and would have virtually no emissions.</p>
        <p>In an echo of research by Henry Ford decades ago into soy-based body panels, the U would have parts made of renewable materials like corn and soybeans.</p>
        <p>Closer to reality are coupe and convertible concepts of a new Mustang that evokes the classic pony car of the 1960's. The concept cars are nearly identical to new models that go on sale as 2004 models.</p>
        <p>Ford also sought inspiration in the 60's for the return of a big, muscular sedan; the Ford 427 concept car would have a powerful V-10 engine. Another Ford concept, the Freestyle FX, offers a hint of what Ford's coming car-utility ''crossover'' will be like.</p>
        <p>Ford will also show a new design for the world's best-selling vehicle, the F-150 pickup. The '04 model is notable for its interiors, including a version with sumptuous appointments. [Money &amp; Business, Section 3.]</p>
        <p>General Motors is using the Detroit and Los Angeles events to showcase its plans to revive Pontiac and Chevrolet. Pontiac, seeking to burnish its faded reputation as G.M.'s performance division, is showing a reborn GTO muscle car based on the Holden Monaro from Australia. The rear-drive coupe will have a 340-horsepower V-8 when it goes on sale late this year. G.M.'s concepts include sporty sedans for both divisions. The sleek Chevrolet SS reinterprets Super Sport features of the 60's. Pontiac's G6 is a Euro-style sport sedan.</p>
        <p>A Buick concept car, the Centieme, celebrates that division's centennial. Designed as a premium crossover vehicle, it combines features of a sedan and sport utility and has a twin-turbocharged V-6 under the hood.</p>
        <p>Cadillac continues its reinvention with the 2004 SRX, a sporty utility wagon, and the XLR roadster. Cadillac is also expected to make a dramatic presentation of a high-end $100,000 car with a V-16 engine.</p>
        <p>At DaimlerChrysler, the focus is on reinvigorating Dodge, which now has a modern version of its famous Hemi V-8 engine. In Detroit, the engine finds a home in the Durango sport utility concept, which closely resembles a 2004 production model.</p>
        <p>Also, a supercharged 430-horsepower version of the Hemi powers the Dodge Magnum SRT-8 concept car unveiled last week in Los Angeles. The Magnum, which goes on sale in 2004, will be the first car built on DaimlerChrysler's new rear-drive architecture, which will be used for several large and midsize models.</p>
        <p>Nissan, which began to reinvent itself years ago when it came under the control of Renault, is continuing its revival by entering new market segments. In Detroit, it will show its first full-size pickup.</p>
        <p>Other new trucks are coming from G.M., which will show two midsize pickups based on the TrailBlazer sport utility architecture; the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon will be 2004 models. G.M. will also show a concept truck, the Chevy Cheyenne, with innovative cargo doors.</p>
        <p>Some carmakers are taking a shot at reinventing the minivan. The new Nissan Quest has high style with a French twist; the ocean-blue Dodge Kahuna concept van is designed with a hip surfer crowd in mind. Also, Toyota will show its next-generation Sienna minivan and production versions of two cars for its youth-oriented Scion subbrand.</p>
        <p>Crossovers -- blends of cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s -- will continue to proliferate. Lexus, a pioneer in car-based sport utilities, is showing its second generation; the RX 330 is heavy on new technology. Infiniti is bringing out its powerful FX45. Two companies are belatedly jumping on the S.U.V. bandwagon with jointly developed vehicles: the Porsche Cayenne and Volkswagen Touareg.</p>
        <p>BMW's xActivity vehicle is a concept version of what is likely to be a utility based on the compact 3 Series -- a smaller alternative to the X5.</p>
        <p>The market for small S.U.V.'s is growing rapidly, and new ones are coming. The Chevrolet Equinox is a more substantial replacement for the Tracker. The Mitsubishi Endeavor is a new midsize utility.</p>
        <p>Despite all the crossovers, trucks and utilities, there will be a number of actual new cars at the auto shows.</p>
        <p>Chevrolet is introducing a redesigned Malibu sedan in Detroit. Mazda goes to market with its RX-8, a four-door, rotary-engine sports car. Acura will showcase a new sport sedan, and Mercedes-Benz will unveil a wagon for its redesigned E-Class line. Nissan is showing a restyled Maxima, and Mitsubishi a high-performance version of its compact Lancer; the Lancer Evolution reaches showrooms next month.</p>
        <p>Some of the biggest news in cars this year is among models with the lowest sales. Mercedes will bring the long version of its Maybach ultraluxury brand to Detroit. Bentley and Rolls-Royce, which this week formalized their divorce after 71 years of marriage, are showing new, independently produced models.</p>
        <p>Audi and Jaguar have redesigned flagship sedans made largely of aluminum. Ferrari's big news is the $670,000 limited-edition Enzo, named for the company's founder (and already sold out), and Maserati is showing a sporty station wagon, the Kubang. Aston Martin's AM V8 Vantage is the precursor to a smaller Aston Martin due in 2005.</p>
        <p>While automakers emphasize luxury and performance, they are also showing alternative vehicles, including G.M.'s Hy-wire and Mercedes-Benz's F-Car. Both run on hydrogen-powered fuel cells.</p>
