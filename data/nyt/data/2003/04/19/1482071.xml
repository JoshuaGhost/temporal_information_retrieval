      <block class="full_text">
        <p>What is left are piles of dirt and heaps of anxiety.</p>
        <p>Three community gardens in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have finally been cleared so the lots can become construction sites for housing. Now all that can be seen are garden hoses, birdhouses and mangled tree branches.</p>
        <p>Ann Thompson, a gardener on Herzl Street who was hoping to see her peach tree bloom in one of the gardens, is now wondering where the bulldozer left the rest of her tree. And over on Legion Street, in a fourth garden, Helen Mason, in a winter coat and walking with a cane, was waiting yesterday -- along with her four ducks -- for the bulldozers to arrive.</p>
        <p>This is what remains of a protracted battle that had pitted green space against housing needs. Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had wanted to replace hundreds of gardens with housing. But in 1999 the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, sued the city to prevent the lots from being auctioned off. In September of last year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Mr. Spitzer reached a compromise that preserved 500 gardens and set aside another 150 for the construction of more than 2,000 apartments. But fights do not end so easily in New York City, especially when the prize is real estate.</p>
        <p>The city sent letters to gardeners like Ms. Mason and Ms. Thompson in February, telling them they had 10 days to vacate the lots where they had cultivated their gardens. But the two women did not clear out, they said, because they had been speaking with a developer for the land, who told them he would consider alternative sites.</p>
        <p>They had also talked to Councilman Charles Barron, who said yesterday that he had spoken to an official at the Department of Housing Preservation and Development about preserving a few Brownsville gardens and was surprised to see Ms. Thompson's garden being demolished. Yesterday, with three gardens in Brownsville already demolished and hers set to be cleared at any moment, Ms. Mason was angry. She said the developer she had spoken to at one of the companies, Diversified Inch by Inch, should keep his promise to look at other sites. ''If you hadn't said it, we wouldn't have had this hope,'' Ms. Mason said.</p>
        <p>Repeated calls to Diversified yesterday were not returned. But Carol Abrams, a spokeswoman for Housing Preservation and Development, said there had been no new discussions about the Brownsville gardens. The lots are still in the city's hands, since the developers need to test the soil for environmental reasons, Ms. Abrams said. About 17 two-family homes will be built in Brownsville, she said, and there is a list of 1,400 people who have shown interest in the properties, which she said would probably sell for about $300,000 each. The development of these houses will not be subsidized by the city, Ms. Abrams said, but the lots are being sold for one dollar, in order to attract developers.</p>
        <p>''This is a city with a housing shortage,'' Ms. Abrams said. ''People are desperate for housing.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Ms. Thompson, with tears in her eyes, recounted how she had planted tomatoes on Wednesday only to arrive the next day and find the bulldozer sitting where her peach tree and fish pond had once been. The American flag she had raised to commemorate Sept. 11 was also gone. She was able to salvage two chairs and some flowers. Now, Ms. Thompson, who runs a day care center in the house next to the garden, the Future Leaders Garden, said she was worried that the city would not finish what it had begun. ''It could be that way for months,'' she said of the pile at the back of the garden.</p>
        <p>Herzl Street wasn't always a hot spot for new housing.</p>
        <p>James McKeather, who moved into the neighborhood in the late 1980's and also had his garden on Herzl Street razed on Thursday, said it took a decade to improve the block. He and other residents patrolled the streets and called the police when young men brought cars into empty lots to strip them. Then, Mr. McKeather said, they started to convert those lots into gardens, filling them with collard greens, strawberry patches and apple trees.</p>
        <p>Now, the street is quiet and when Mr. McKeather's neighbor, Janette Maxwell, walked past the garden yesterday and heard about the new development, she said she was going to call her son, who wanted to buy a house.</p>
        <p>It could be said that this is a drama with too many good guys and not enough bad guys.</p>
        <p>Horace Watt, who arrived on Herzl Street on Thursday in a bulldozer, said later that he was at war with himself. It was his job to clear about 20 lots in Brownsville by Monday evening. When he arrived at Ms. Thompson's garden, he said he looked at the mural, the trees and the children's furniture, and he called his boss to make sure that he had the right place.</p>
        <p>''It bothered me,'' Mr. Watt said yesterday at another site on Blake Avenue that had not been used as a garden. ''I don't like to destroy stuff.''</p>
        <p>But he had a job to do, he said. It was even harder, he said, when he saw Ms. Mason's garden, called Fantasy Garden.</p>
        <p>''That lady's got ducks,'' Mr. Watt said. ''They had good stuff there.''</p>
        <p>So Ms. Mason waits for Mr. Watt to arrive. Friends are helping her move the ducks and the birdhouses to her backyard. ''You have to be realistic,'' she said. ''You can't just leave it here and expect a miracle.''</p>
