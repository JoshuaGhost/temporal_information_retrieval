        <p>WHEN Jon Green was growing up in rural Massachusetts in the 1970's, his family's phone service consisted of a party line shared with several neighbors. A simple rabbit-ears antenna captured all of seven television channels.</p>
        <p>Today, like many middle-class Americans, Mr. Green and his wife, Stacie, carry cellphones, and their home in Maynard, Mass., has a land-line phone, cable television and a high-speed connection to the Internet, each offering an array of extra services. The connections they have come to consider necessities are discreet if not invisible. The tangible reminder is the stack of bills the Greens must pay each month.</p>
        <p>When technology executives and marketers talk about the value of their products, they tend to focus on computer chips, which are 350 times more powerful today than they were 20 years ago and cost about a third as much.</p>
        <p>But it is not the cost of the machines that has most altered household budgets. Instead, all that cheap computing power embedded in scores of new gadgets and married to communications networks has resulted in a growing number of subscription services that most consumers cannot resist -- and continuing charges that they cannot escape.</p>
        <p>The party line phone service they had in 1974 probably cost Mr. Green's family about $19 a month, the equivalent of about $70 today when adjusted for inflation. Long-distance calls were thought of as expensive, infrequent luxuries. Watching television was free, and access to the Internet would not be generally available or billable for two decades.</p>
        <p>Today the Greens pay more than $225 a month for services that enable them to watch television, make phone calls and communicate over the Internet. That is more than a threefold increase, in today's dollars, for communications and home entertainment.</p>
        <p>Research at Columbia University in the late 1990's suggests that like the Greens, most other American households have spent an increasing percentage of their disposable income over the last decade to link themselves to the outside world. Other research, done at Rutgers University, suggests that the appetite for such services has not reached its limit: American families are spending only about half as much as they say they would be willing to pay for technologies that would perfectly meet their needs. That is heartening news for the companies that are trying to convince consumers of the virtues of high-speed Internet connections or digital cable or satellite television services.</p>
        <p>Not everyone, to be sure, is happy about that continuing evolution. Some consumers say they resent the addictive nature of such offerings.</p>
        <p>''They get you hooked, and then you can't let go,'' said Sari Boren, a designer of museum exhibits from Cambridge, Mass. ''A big part of what bothers me about the monthly payment thing is that no matter which of these services you subscribe to, you know they're going to keep raising the rates.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the mix of services differs from household to household.</p>
        <p>Many families consider extensive cable television access or unlimited cellphone use to be a greater priority than access to the Internet. Music lovers might tend to spend more for subscriptions to online jukeboxes or satellite radio systems. Frequent business travelers are likely to spend more than others for access to mobile wireless Internet services.</p>
        <p>''I know a lot of people who pay over $100 just for cable TV,'' said Tyrone Chee, a 42-year-old senior hardware engineer for R.R. Donnelly &amp; Sons, a Manhattan-based printing concern. ''Television isn't that important to me. We just have basic cable.''</p>
        <p>But that does not mean Mr. Chee is not paying in other ways for his family's mix of technologies. His outlay for various communications services at his home in Maplewood, N.J., is about $400 a month -- if his 15-year-old daughter stays within the allotted minutes on her cellphone plan. ''Last month, I ended up with a $600 cellphone bill because one of us talked way too much,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Chee described his daughter's cellphone bill as ''clearly excessive,'' he added that for himself and his wife, Dana, ''the cellphone is an absolute necessity.''</p>
        <p>The notion of what constitutes a necessity varies from one household to another, but some services tend to become ingrained and all but indispensable. Both the telephone and television have achieved this status, with a presence in more than 90 percent of American households. While only 54 percent of homes have Internet access and about 56 percent subscribe to a wireless phone service, the Internet and the cellphone service are considered essential by many people.</p>
        <p>An analysis of government data by academic researchers over the last 25 years shows that from the 1920's through the 80's, the average household spent about 6 percent of its disposable income on ''information and entertainment,'' a category embracing everything from newspapers and movies to telephone service, radios and television sets.</p>
        <p>In the 1990's that figure jumped to 8 percent. Today, ''it looks like it's more than 10 percent,'' said John Carey, who teaches courses in new media at Columbia University's graduate school of business. Clearly, Mr. Carey said, the increase in consumer spending on information and entertainment coincided with widespread expansion of cable and satellite TV and with the rapid growth of the public Internet.</p>
        <p>''The so-called information age and information economy are reaching down to the household level,'' said Mr. Carey, who has tracked consumer spending on communications media since 1990.</p>
        <p>And the effects go far beyond the so-called early adopters, those people who are first to embrace a new form of technology. Gary Kemp, a trademark lawyer in Boston, described himself and his wife, Jayne, a book editor, as ''techno-minimalists.'' Nonetheless, he said, ''We pay about $140 for basic cable, low-level local and long-distance service for one land line, the cheapest possible cellphone plan, and a basic modem-based Internet connection,'' he said. ''The sheer number of bills is driving me nuts.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp is resigned to the idea that he will probably have to add network services as his 3-year-old daughter grows up. ''When Susanna's old enough to spend too much time either on the phone or the Internet, I'll probably get a package service,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But by the time his daughter is old enough to commandeer the family's phone or computer, there are sure to be many more network services vying to entice the Kemps into tacking another monthly payment or two onto the family budget.</p>
        <p>As for his idea of a consumer-friendly package of services, that turns out to be something many consumers say they want, said James E. Katz, a professor of communications at Rutgers University. But, he is quick to add, ''there's a fundamental difference between what people say and what they do.''</p>
        <p>When AT&amp;T bundled a number of services into one monthly bill, he said, consumers went into sticker shock and cut back their expenditures.</p>
        <p>''If you're getting pelted monthly by a lot of little bills, it's irritating, but you don't tend to realize how much all that adds up to,'' Professor Katz said. ''Whereas when they get all those items in one bill, people get horrified at how much they're spending. They start looking for ways to make the total dollar amount go down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Katz said his research suggested that if subscription costs were billed discretely, American consumers would continue to pay more for new gadgets and ways to connect with each other.</p>
        <p>Certainly there will be no shortage of new subscription services from which to choose. Companies are already aggressively marketing satellite radio, mobile wireless Internet broadband and myriad new online services. Networks that connect hand-held devices to the Internet are beginning seem essential to business travelers. Cable and satellite operators continue to add new products like digital broadcasts, high-definition content and video on demand. Wireless phone companies, which are already promoting cellphones that can take and transmit photos, plan to introduce dozens of other new Internet-based products over the next five years.</p>
        <p>Many market analysts predict that the surging popularity of TiVo, the digital television recorder, will inspire new home video servers that capture signals from multiple Internet, cable and satellite networks and feed them to computers, televisions and other devices around the house.</p>
        <p>What all these emerging services have in common is a business model based on subscriptions that are billed monthly or yearly. What the most successful services will share is an appeal that will quickly evolve from intriguing to compelling to essential.</p>
        <p>''These things always start out as somewhat exotic luxuries,'' said Professor Katz. ''But it's surprising how quickly, by historical standards, they come to be perceived as necessities.''</p>
        <p>For example, for the first 40 years of its existence, the telephone was considered something of a luxury, or perhaps a dispensable convenience, he said. But by the 1960's, welfare agencies throughout the United States were incorporating phone costs into their calculations of welfare benefits as an essential commodity, like heat and electricity.</p>
        <p>At his home in Massachusetts, Mr. Green, a 37-year-old computer-systems specialist, discovered how irresistible communication services can be when he was laid off last year. ''I looked carefully to see if there was any way we could reduce the level of service and save money,'' he recalled. ''Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any.''</p>
        <p>Not without pain, anyway. He could have saved $65 a month by dropping the high-speed Internet service he gets over his phone line, but he said: ''I'd have to be incredibly desperate before I gave up broadband. I don't even want to think about that.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Ms. Boren, the museum-exhibit designer, finds it ''insane that I spend $46 a month for broadband when I'm online at home a total of about four hours a week.'' Yet, she said, ''I would have to be facing extreme economic hardship before I would give it up. In fact, I would first cut out cable TV, even though I use cable multiple hours more than I use broadband.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Boren, who is 38 and single, pays $128 a month for her combined cable television and cable modem services. Her personal line of resistance is the cellphone -- she has refused to get one, which she said made her ''practically a social pariah.''</p>
        <p>''But why should it?'' she said. ''It's not like I have a husband or kids that need to reach me all the time.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Boren acknowledged a limit to her resistance. ''Twenty dollars is my breaking point,'' she said. ''If I could find a plan for $20 a month, I would have a cellphone.''</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, research shows that price is an important factor in most consumer decisions about whether and when to subscribe to a new service. But research by Professor Katz suggests that the typical American household is nowhere near its limit -- that the average family would be willing to spend as much as $500 a month for the right combination of subscription services.</p>
        <p>''It isn't really all that much money given the value of the services,'' he said. ''Consider that they get all the pleasures of fabulous sound, rich pictures, entertainment, multimillion-dollar films brought into their homes, highly individualized communications networks with which they can visit with their friends in an unlimited way any time. That takes the place of a lot of trips on the Concorde a generation ago, or, in generations before that, a trip on a luxury liner.''</p>
        <p>''Network creep,'' as Professor Katz calls the proliferation of subscription services, has already had a significant impact on household budgets in the United States, he said, but because of the perceived value of the new services and because the phenomenon took place gradually over two prosperous decades, it has gone unnoticed by many consumers.</p>
        <p>Now that times are leaner, however, many households are re-evaluating monthly expenses and reassessing priorities. Some analysts are pessimistic about consumers' willingness to take on new services at a time of high unemployment and record consumer debt.</p>
        <p>Allan Tumolillo, the chief operating officer of Probe Research, a consulting firm in Cedar Knolls, N.J., that specializes in the telecommunications sector, said his biggest concern was consumer debt, which is now more than $1.7 trillion. Measured as a percentage of the nation's gross domestic product, that is the highest consumer debt level since the beginning of the Great Depression, according to government data.</p>
        <p>''This new-economy thing of subscribe to this, subscribe to that gets to be a lot of money,'' Mr. Tumolillo said. ''You end up with some people paying $500 to $1,000 a month between their cable service, their cellphones, their phone lines, their long distance, their Internet service provider, two or three information services, music videos, what have you.''</p>
        <p>Writing in an advisory for his clients in the telecommunications sector recently, Mr. Tumolillo suggested that baby boomers who are approaching retirement age during an economic downturn might change their habits.</p>
        <p>''Where will consumers put their dollars?'' he wrote. ''On services like D.S.L., cable modems, multiple cellular lines, I.S.P. accounts, online gaming, other subscriber-based services? Or will they shift spending toward more home improvement, toward health care, savings, paying off debt? This is extraordinarily difficult to predict.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Boren suggested that perhaps the biggest cost of network creep was not in dollars but in the lost opportunities, amid the unrelenting buzz of a hyper-connected culture, to reflect quietly on the day's events or life in general. ''The lack of a cellphone allows me to have unproductive moments,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In an ever more connected world, unproductive moments, not the hottest new service, could prove to be the ultimate luxury.</p>
