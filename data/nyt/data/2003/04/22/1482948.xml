        <p>Federal prosecutors here indicted an immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security and two other people today, accusing them of conspiring to smuggle 130 illegal immigrants into the country from Lebanon and Yemen over five years.</p>
        <p>''Immigration fraud cases like this potentially pose a threat to national security,'' said Jeffrey G. Collins, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, ''and that's why we are vigorously prosecuting the case, including prosecuting an employee of the entity that was supposed to protect us.''</p>

        <p>Federal prosecutors here indicted an immigration official at the Department of Homeland Security and two other people today, accusing them of conspiring to smuggle 130 illegal immigrants into the country from Lebanon and Yemen over five years.</p>
        <p>''Immigration fraud cases like this potentially pose a threat to national security,'' said Jeffrey G. Collins, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, ''and that's why we are vigorously prosecuting the case, including prosecuting an employee of the entity that was supposed to protect us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Collins said that more than half of the illegal immigrants had been found and that none of those had been determined to have discernable connections to terrorism. They entered the United States between 1998 and October 2002.</p>
        <p>There was little clarity, though, regarding those illegal immigrants who had not yet been found. Federal agents are looking for them, Mr. Collins said, adding that prosecutors would ''make a determination on a case-by-case basis whether or not they should be criminally charged or be removed from the country.''</p>
        <p>Janice Halstead, 59, of Detroit, was indicted for bribery, two counts of conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants into the United States, and several counts of attempted alien smuggling. Ms. Halstead, who worked for the Immigration and Naturalization Service and then for the Department of Homeland Security when the immigration agency became a part of it, received $3,000 to $5,000 in cash, a bedroom set, jewelry and other gifts, the indictment and Mr. Collins said.</p>
        <p>The overall value of the goods and cash was not disclosed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Halstead, reached at home after being released on bond, said she was not guilty. She has not formally entered a plea.</p>
        <p>''I think I probably made the wrong person mad,'' she said, adding that she did know one of the other defendants, Zoha Madarani, but not the other, Salah Al-Solihi.</p>
        <p>Ms. Madarani, 38, of Dearborn, Mich., and Mr. Al-Solihi, 45, of New York, were indicted for conspiracy to smuggle illegal immigrants into the United States and charges related to immigrant smuggling.</p>
        <p>Ms. Madarani and Mr. Al-Solihi could not be found, and officials did not say if they were citizens or foreigners.</p>
        <p>The indictments, which were unsealed today, stem from two similar cases involving federal grand juries in Detroit and Flint, both part of the Eastern District of Michigan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Madarani was indicted in federal court in Detroit, and Mr. Al-Solihi in Flint. Both grand juries indicted Ms. Halstead.</p>
        <p>In the case from the Flint grand jury, Mr. Al-Solihi is accused of instructing foreigners to obtain false passports with false names. Ms. Halstead is accused of validating them with an official stamp, while Mr. Al-Solihi is accused of sending them overseas, where they were used by foreigners to enter the country.</p>
        <p>In the case from the Detroit grand jury, Ms. Madarani is accused of providing Ms. Halstead with the names and photographs of people living outside of the country who were not eligible to enter legally. The indictment says the two women conspired to provide the inadmissible immigrants with false documents.</p>
        <p>Ms. Madarani owns a consulting business that helps potential immigrants, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>''The case is very disturbing because it represents a violation of public trust,'' Mr. Collins said.</p>
        <p>Edward Dyner, special agent in charge of the Justice Department's office of inspector general, said in a statement: ''Department of Justice employees are not for sale. The inspector general's office takes seriously any allegations against department employees and will thoroughly investigate them.''</p>
        <p>If convicted, Ms. Halstead faces up to 22 years in prison and $750,000 in fines from the Detroit case and up to 65 years in prison and $1.5 million in the Flint case. Ms. Madarani could receive up to 20 years in prison and a $750,000 fine; Mr. Al-Solihi faces 65 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines.</p>
