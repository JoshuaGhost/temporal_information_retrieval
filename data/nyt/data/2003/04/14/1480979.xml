        <p>Mets jerseys worn by fans in the bleachers became targets this afternoon when Armando Benitez took the mound. A game-tying home run by the Expos' Orlando Cabrera was soon sailing their way.</p>
        <p>Benitez seems to haunt Mets fans wherever he is. He continued a horrific stretch for himself and his teammates today, wasting a good effort by Al Leiter in just three pitches in the ninth inning. Mike Stanton followed Benitez in the 10th and was just as bad. He surrendered the winning home run to Jose Vidro on his first pitch for a 2-1 Montreal victory.</p>
        <p>Benitez is dissolving before the Mets' eyes, and he is taking his team down with him. The Mets lost their fifth straight game and have scored 10 runs in that stretch. They have suffered injuries on top of losses -- Mike Piazza jammed his foot and Mo Vaughn left with knee inflammation today -- and they have played sloppily and have squandered leads.</p>
        <p>''To lose the way we've been losing -- any loss is bad but to have frustrating losses, I just hope the guys don't have negative thoughts,'' said Leiter, who threw six shutout innings in temperatures that reached 142 degrees on the artificial turf.</p>
        <p>Vidro, the Expos' Puerto Rican second baseman, punched his fist in the air as chants of ''Vidro!'' and horns blared from the 16,332 fans at Hiram Bithorn Stadium when he won the game. He was greeted by teammates at the plate, thrust his helmet in the air as he approached the dugout and then answered a curtain call.</p>
        <p>The song ''Who Let the Dogs Out'' played on speakers, and it seemed as if everyone was in on the joke. That was Benitez's anthem as he saved games on the Mets' road to the 2000 World Series, before blowing Game 1.</p>
        <p>Benitez has not had many blown saves since then, but they are etched painfully in fans' memories. He drew jeers upon introductions Friday and was booed off the mound today after the ninth.</p>
        <p>''It's been real hard,'' Benitez said, ''especially when you're in a country that's almost like part of your people.''</p>
        <p>Benitez is from the Dominican Republic, but he has been the one Latin American player not embraced by fans here. Today's blown save was his third in eight days, giving him one fewer this season than he had all of last year.</p>
        <p>The wall in left-center field is 365 feet from home plate, short by major league standards, and the wind was blowing in throughout the game. The crowd roared as Cabrera pulled Benitez's 1-1 fastball to left. Benitez appeared mesmerized by the ball's path, turned and appeared surprised when shortstop Jay Bell arrived to visit with him. Bell appeared to speak strongly to Benitez, but he said he delivered a soft message, reminding Benitez that the game could still be won.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't very strong,'' Bell said. ''It was very gentle. I wanted to get my point across. I wanted to make eye contact.''</p>
        <p>Leiter had put the Mets in position to win, escaping a bases-loaded jam in the third inning, overcoming four walks, two hit batters and a balk and making Roberto Alomar's first-inning run-scoring single hold up. David Weathers threw two shutout innings, punching his fist when Piazza threw out Endy Chavez trying to steal second to end the seventh.</p>
        <p>Leiter said Benitez, as the closer, has a thankless job. ''There's no parachute past the closer,'' Leiter said.</p>
        <p>Stanton said Benitez's problems were compounded by the team's struggles.</p>
        <p>The Mets were 1 for 7, meanwhile, with runners in scoring position today after going 1 for 17 Saturday, and the injury situation is getting worse. Piazza went 1 for 3, ending an 0-for-17 streak when he jammed his left foot beating out an infield hit in the ninth, and he left the game. Howe said Piazza could play Monday afternoon when the Mets and the Expos conclude their series here. Cliff Floyd, who strained his left Achilles' tendon Saturday, popped out as a pinch-hitter and was walking gingerly afterward. Vaughn left in the third with inflammation in his left knee.</p>
        <p>Art Howe, who maintained that Benitez would remain the closer, is facing his first crisis in his first season as the Mets' manager, and he held a brief team meeting after the game.</p>
        <p>''It can't go on any longer,'' Alomar said. ''If it goes longer, we're going nowhere.''</p>
