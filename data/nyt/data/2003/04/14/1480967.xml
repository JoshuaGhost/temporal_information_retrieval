        <p>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund announced today that they would send teams to Iraq to assess needs for reconstruction as soon as it was safe.</p>
        <p>The announcement amounted to a concession to the Bush administration, which wants as much support as possible from the two international financial institutions to rebuild Iraq. Earlier this week the leaders of both institutions said they would need the approval from their boards before agreeing to send teams of experts to assess the shape of the Iraqi economy and its needs.</p>

        <p>The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund announced today that they would send teams to Iraq to assess needs for reconstruction as soon as it was safe.</p>
        <p>The announcement amounted to a concession to the Bush administration, which wants as much support as possible from the two international financial institutions to rebuild Iraq. Earlier this week the leaders of both institutions said they would need the approval from their boards before agreeing to send teams of experts to assess the shape of the Iraqi economy and its needs.</p>
        <p>That approval came over the weekend, with strong pressure from the United States, the major shareholder in both institutions.</p>
        <p>James D. Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, said any help given to Iraq would not deflect from his institution's main mission to fight the war on global poverty. He even said he hoped the estimated $20 billion needed immediately for Iraqi would not come from the bank.</p>
        <p>''Most people think it's coming from oil revenue -- or from somebody else,'' said Mr. Wolfensohn, adding that it would not come out of ''our base money.''</p>
        <p>But on this last day of the annual spring financial meetings, protesters and charity groups argued that Mr. Wolfensohn was a victim of wishful thinking if he believed that the war in Iraq would not drain resources from the war on poverty.</p>
        <p>''The speed with which political will and resources are mobilized to invade, bomb and possibly reconstruct Iraq stand in stark contrast to the willingness of the rich countries to tackle poverty in Africa,'' said Phil Twyford, advocacy director of the private charity Oxfam International.</p>
        <p>His critique was mild compared with accusations from a crowd of protesters that gathered near the two institutions on a sparkling spring day to complain that the World Bank and I.M.F. continued to favor wealthy nations to the detriment of the developing world.</p>
        <p>''We think the real war isn't the war on Iraq but the war on poverty, and they've been promising to wage it for years but they haven't,'' said Jamie Drummond, executive director of Debt, AIDS, Trade in Africa, a nonprofit group affiliated with Bono, lead singer for the rock group U2.</p>
        <p>World Bank officials agreed that the onus was clearly on wealthy countries to help the poor and that they have not given up the fight against world poverty.</p>
        <p>Nicholas Stern, the chief economist at the World Bank, said, ''The battle will be won by collaboration and not confrontation.''</p>
        <p>He then praised developing nations for improving their policies and institutions, especially for the health and education of their citizens.</p>
        <p>''There has been stronger momentum by the developing nations than the rich nations,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If wealthy nations lowered their trade barriers and increased their foreign aid, which is at record lows, then global poverty could be cut in half by 2015, he said.</p>
        <p>The worst trade barrier is the $300 billion in agricultural subsidies given to farmers in the world's wealthy nations, Mr. Stern said. Those subsidies drive down the world prices of staple commodities and allow wealthy nations to dump inexpensive food in poor countries and make it difficult for poor nations to ship to wealthy nations one of their few exportable products: agricultural goods.</p>
        <p>But so far the United States and Europe have failed to agree on a formula for reducing those subsidies as part of the World Trade Organization's latest negotiations on opening up trade known as the Doha round.</p>
        <p>Foreign assistance is now less than half what it was in the 1960's, when wealthy nations had a much lower gross national product.</p>
        <p>Because of the trade barriers and the drop in foreign aid, the World Bank estimates that it will require an additional $50 billion to reach the 2015 goals set by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The World Bank today released its world development indicators, an annual compilation of statistics that showed there was steady progress in the 1990's in reducing the number of poor people living on less than $1 a day, the World Bank's definition of poverty. Most of those gains were achieved by India and China. In sub-Saharan Africa, the number of poor was 315 million, up from 241 million.</p>
        <p>The World Bank and I.M.F. focused their private deliberations on the need to do more for Africa, but there were no pledges of new funds to fight poverty.</p>
        <p>Already the run-up to the Iraqi war and the war itself have cost the world economy roughly $75 billion to $100 billion. That sum is similar to the economic reaction after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said the ''risk is there'' that the war in Iraq will divert attention and money that might otherwise go to the World Bank's efforts against poverty. ''It is our job to stay the course,'' he said.</p>
