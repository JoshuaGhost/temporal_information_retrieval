        <p>Amid the corporate scandals, bankruptcies, rising unemployment and falling consumer confidence, it's a glum time on Wall Street. But if you look a little closer you can find something to laugh about. So believes David Moore, chairman of Sonostar Ventures L.L.C., a private equity and venture capital firm in Chappaqua, N.Y.</p>
        <p>That could explain why Mr. Moore, 47, who moonlights as a stand-up comedian, is the host of the first annual ''Business Comedy Night'' at Caroline's on Broadway, the comedy club between 49th and 50th Streets in Manhattan. The show is scheduled for April 15, the deadline for personal tax returns.</p>

        <p>Amid the corporate scandals, bankruptcies, rising unemployment and falling consumer confidence, it's a glum time on Wall Street. But if you look a little closer you can find something to laugh about. So believes David Moore, chairman of Sonostar Ventures L.L.C., a private equity and venture capital firm in Chappaqua, N.Y.</p>
        <p>That could explain why Mr. Moore, 47, who moonlights as a stand-up comedian, is the host of the first annual ''Business Comedy Night'' at Caroline's on Broadway, the comedy club between 49th and 50th Streets in Manhattan. The show is scheduled for April 15, the deadline for personal tax returns.</p>
        <p>On this night, which Mr. Moore describes as ''the most unfunny day of the year,'' he and other comedians, including Kevin Meaney and Jim Gaffigan, will crack wise about corporate scandals, economic policy, unemployment -- and, yes, the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>''People who've paid their taxes are done crying, and now they want to laugh,'' Mr. Moore said. ''The reality is there are a lot of comedians who make fun of big business. The bad press -- Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, Martha Stewart, Bill Gates -- has certainly been good for comedians.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore offered a sample from his act: ''I keep reading that they can't find any written evidence to indict Martha Stewart.'' Pause. ''Are we supposed to believe that Martha Stewart made $200,000 on the stock trade and never sent a thank-you note?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore, who received an M.B.A. from Harvard, said he was a toast maker extraordinaire at weddings and bar mitzvahs, but did not follow his interest in comedy. Three years ago, a friend faxed him information about an amateur comedy night; he went, performed, ''killed'' and was hooked. Caroline Hirsch, who owns Caroline's, calls him ''the world's funniest C.E.O.''</p>
        <p>He is modest about this honor. ''I'm not sure that's such a great moniker -- it's like 'the world's funniest undertaker,' '' he said. ''I'm not sure there's that much competition; I think I'm the only C.E.O. currently on the comedy circuit.''</p>
