        <p>A former editor at The New York Post charged in a federal lawsuit yesterday that she was dismissed by the newspaper last year after complaining of discrimination. The former editor, Maralyn Matlick, claims that she was discriminated against because she was a woman and was not Australian or British. She was the paper's Sunday editor. The Post, whose top editor is Australian and whose owner was born in Australia and became an American citizen, denied the allegations. A Post spokeswoman noted that the paper had hired an American woman to fill the position Ms. Matlick left. The suit seeks damages and reinstatement.</p>
