        <p>STEIN-Bernard Z. On April 15, 2003 in his 90th year, of complications from prostate cancer. Loving husband of Marion, father of Ellen (Howard) and Rob (Mara), grandfather of Andrew (Stephanie), David, Laura, Reyna and Bart. He was loved by family and friends, and his warmth and his smile will be deeply missed by all. Funeral services private. Because he was active in many philanthropic activities, the family requests in lieu of flowers contributions to the charity of your choice.</p>
