        <p>The movies selected for the New York African Film Festival, which opens tomorrow at the Walter Reade Theater, are centered mostly on the concept of home. It is a theme highlighted in the work of the director Abderrahmane Sissako, the recipient of a mini-retrospective during the six-day festival.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Sissako, who is from Mali, home is something so deeply wired into the nervous system that it informs every decision: it is part of a person's genetic makeup. His blissfully absorbing ''Waiting for Happiness,'' which had too brief a run at last fall's New York Film Festival, will be shown each day of the festival.</p>

        <p>The movies selected for the New York African Film Festival, which opens tomorrow at the Walter Reade Theater, are centered mostly on the concept of home. It is a theme highlighted in the work of the director Abderrahmane Sissako, the recipient of a mini-retrospective during the six-day festival.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Sissako, who is from Mali, home is something so deeply wired into the nervous system that it informs every decision: it is part of a person's genetic makeup. His blissfully absorbing ''Waiting for Happiness,'' which had too brief a run at last fall's New York Film Festival, will be shown each day of the festival.</p>
        <p>The film, made in 2000, deserves this second window of opportunity. It steadily immerses us in a young man's homeland and its rhythms. Abdallah has been away from his West African seaside village so long that he can no longer connect with home on its most basic level: he has forgotten the local dialect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sissako gives heft and breadth to home in all of his films by using silences and pauses so eloquently that the chatter other filmmakers use to fill screen time seems empty and meaningless. In ''Waiting for Happiness,'' the quiet between spoken passages indicates comfort and warm propinquity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sissako's 1998 film ''Life on Earth,'' which will be shown tomorrow and Monday, features the filmmaker himself returning to his father's village. ''My heart was bursting with fire and ardor,'' he writes to his father. This film offers an insight into the genesis of ''Waiting for Happiness'': it accepts his father's appreciation of the land, seemingly a space untouched by time and far from the pressures of the outside world.</p>
        <p>But his father's world doesn't lack complications. The encroaching threat of the white world, with its rush and its implicit condescension toward the old ways, is presented as well. ''Life on Earth'' presents the real-world version of the paradise found in ''Waiting for Happiness'' -- a heaven also in danger of vanishing.</p>
        <p>''Life on Earth'' is preceded by Mr. Sissako's 1991 black-and-white short ''October.'' It starts with a poetic image: the dark-skinned African Idrissa trudging through the snowy forest of Moscow to meet his girlfriend, Ira. This film takes us into a home that isn't all magical imagery. Moscow's crumbling concrete bleakness is a desolate counterpoint to the healing environs of Mr. Sissako's Africa.</p>
        <p>When ''October'' offers a rare glimpse of color, it is the blood pricked by a thorn; even a rose brings more pain into Ira's life. The chasm between the two is ominous: everything in Ira's life has to be hidden, from Idrissa's presence in her apartment to the pregnancy that she will probably not allow to continue. ''October'' is about the dying of fire and ardor.</p>
        <p>Two of the festival's documentaries deal with the Zimbabwe of Robert Mugabe. In Farai Sevenzo's short ''Zimbabwe 2002,'' the director takes as small and personal a view of the 2002 elections as possible. He examines them through the neighborhood in which he grew up, and the way they split his own family. Though the household remains genial, thanks to his conciliatory sister, there is a divide: only his brother voted for Mr. Mugabe, swayed by what his sister summarizes as ''the president's cleverest idea, to incite racial hatred.'' The short ends on a lovely musical note, with his youngest sister crooning a pop-blues tune.</p>
        <p>Rehed Dasai's ''My Land, My Life'' (2002) also focuses on home, as the filmmaker returns to Zimbabwe to explore his disenchantment with Mr. Mugabe in detail by showing how his rule decimated the lives of farmers and war veterans.</p>
        <p>Kwaw Ansah's 1989 film ''Heritage Africa,'' from Ghana, takes as its balmy, satirical subject the life of an African who refuses to accept as home the land he was raised in. Kwesi Attar Bosomefi is so hypnotized by colonialism that he gives himself a name more fitting a white provincial governor: Quincy Arthur Bosomfield. Mr. Ansah peppers his film with darkly dramatic moments and takes his protagonist on a dream journey that finally shows him where home -- and heart -- can truly be found.</p>
