        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Indus River basin certainly presents a grim picture of the economic, ecological and social disasters created downstream by large dams built on a river (''A River Diverted, the Sea Rushes In,'' April 22).</p>
        <p>The same folly is being repeated in countless other basins where large new dams are still being built to address highly controversial flood-control, hydropower and irrigation goals.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, most of the world's large rivers are shared by two or more nations that mostly view the waters flowing through or along their lands as a resource to be exploited. Getting nations to develop the potential of the shared rivers in an enlightened and cooperative manner is a challenge that the international community urgently needs to address.</p>
