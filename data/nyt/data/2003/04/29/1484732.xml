        <p>Dishing in the Laboratory</p>
        <p>For lovers of Italian food, there can be few finer concoctions than a steaming tray of manicotti -- tubes of pasta stuffed with a seasoned ricotta-egg mixture.</p>
        <p>In a laboratory at Tel Aviv University in Israel, researchers have been cooking up a kind of manicotti of their own. Instead of pasta tubes, however, they use a peptide molecule -- a short chain of amino acids -- that assembles itself into tiny tubes. And instead of ricotta cheese, they stuff their tubes with silver. What results are nanoscale wires, on the order of 20 billionths of a meter in diameter.</p>

        <p>Dishing in the Laboratory</p>
        <p>For lovers of Italian food, there can be few finer concoctions than a steaming tray of manicotti -- tubes of pasta stuffed with a seasoned ricotta-egg mixture.</p>
        <p>In a laboratory at Tel Aviv University in Israel, researchers have been cooking up a kind of manicotti of their own. Instead of pasta tubes, however, they use a peptide molecule -- a short chain of amino acids -- that assembles itself into tiny tubes. And instead of ricotta cheese, they stuff their tubes with silver. What results are nanoscale wires, on the order of 20 billionths of a meter in diameter.</p>
        <p>The peptide involved is an interesting one. In humans, it forms the fibrils that kill brain cells in people with Alzheimer's disease. The researchers found that by taking a fragment of the peptide -- the part responsible for shaping it into fibrils -- they could produce much more orderly tubes, most of them about 100 billionths of a meter in diameter and several microns long.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who describe their work in the current issue of Science, also realized that the tubes were hollow. By putting them in a solution with silver ions, and then reducing the ions to elemental silver, they produced silver-stuffed nanotubes -- nanomanicotti, you might call it. Then by dissolving the peptide tube with an enzyme, they were left with silver nanowires.</p>
        <p>Aside from being a neat trick, tiny wires formed in this way may eventually find applications in tiny electronic devices like microsensors.</p>
        <p>Traveling Birds' Brains</p>
        <p>Travel is a mind-expanding experience, as every college student headed off to a summer in Europe has been told.</p>
        <p>For garden warblers, though, this is more than a trite saying: it is literally true. The brains of migratory adult warblers have larger hippocampal formations than those of juvenile birds that have yet to travel. This makes sense, given that the hippocampus is where the brain processes spatial information.</p>
        <p>While such neuroanatomical differences have been noted, there have been few studies of cognitive differences between migrating and nonmigrating birds. Now, however, researchers from the Max Planck Research Center for Ornithology in Germany have shown that some migratory birds have longer-term memories than their stay-at-home counterparts.</p>
        <p>The researchers, who reported on their work in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, studied garden warblers, which migrate from Europe to sub-Saharan Africa, and a close nonmigrating relative, the Sardinian warbler. In experiments, the birds were allowed to explore two vegetation-filled rooms, one with food and the other with none. The birds were tested at various later points to determine whether they remembered which room was the better source of food.</p>
        <p>The researchers found that the garden warblers could remember the better room up to 12 months after being exposed to it, while the Sardinian warblers' memory faded after two weeks. The garden warblers, the researchers suggest, have adapted to the migratory life, developing a long-term memory that serves them well by enabling them to remember where to stop for food, what areas to avoid and how to find their usual breeding sites.</p>
        <p>More 'C.S.I.' Fans</p>
        <p>Scientists are people, too. How else to explain the results of a survey by The Scientist magazine on its readers' television habits?</p>
        <p>The magazine, which covers the life sciences, found in an earlier survey that about 80 percent of its readers watched television regularly. This time, they asked 317 readers exactly what types of shows they fancied.</p>
        <p>Four in five said they watched news programs, and slightly more than two-thirds, science documentaries. One-third enjoyed science-fiction shows, while only 15 percent said they watched reality television. Of individual programs, the favorite, perhaps unsurprisingly, was ''C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation.''</p>
