        <p>In the winter that would not die, the snowstorm that nobody wanted had the effrontery to deliver yet another unappreciated gift to the metropolitan region yesterday, doing its best to nip spring quite literally in the bud.</p>
        <p>The unseasonable insult was, for some, the last straw in a winter-weary region that has not only been on high alert since Sept. 11, 2001, but that also more recently withstood a Washington's Birthday blizzard and round-the-clock Iraqi war advisories, not to mention SARS angst.</p>

        <p>The snowstorm that nobody wanted had the effrontery to deliver yet another unappreciated gift to the metropolitan region Monday.</p>

        <p>In the winter that would not die, the snowstorm that nobody wanted had the effrontery to deliver yet another unappreciated gift to the metropolitan region yesterday, doing its best to nip spring quite literally in the bud.</p>
        <p>The unseasonable insult was, for some, the last straw in a winter-weary region that has not only been on high alert since Sept. 11, 2001, but that also more recently withstood a Washington's Birthday blizzard and round-the-clock Iraqi war advisories, not to mention SARS angst.</p>
        <p>''Isn't everybody sick of this?'' said Sgt. Don Dragan of the New Jersey Transit Police in Hoboken, wrinkling his nose with disdain as the heavy flurries drifted down. ''This is trout season, not Christmas.''</p>
        <p>Arriving pretty much as predicted toward the end of the morning rush, the storm's leading edge churned through New Jersey from the southwest, disrupting airport flight schedules, closing schools and bedeviling traffic on city streets and country roads before swirling eastward to spread blowing whiteouts over Long Island and Connecticut.</p>
        <p>After midnight, as the last drops of freezing drizzle headed east over Long Island, the storm had delivered five to eight inches of snow to the city and Long Island, with one to three inches in Connecticut and the Lower Hudson Valley, said Nancy Figueroa, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. In New Jersey, eight inches fell on Cranford and seven inches on Elizabeth, she said.</p>
        <p>While there was fierce opposition from isolated pockets of resistance, the response to the snow was outright capitulation in some quarters. For example, the home opener of the New York Yankees against the Minnesota Twins was postponed before the arrival of a single snowflake.</p>
        <p>But others, already accommodated to spring, showed the storm a measure of contempt. Erik Mitchell sought no more protection from the elements than blue jeans and a thin checkered shirt as he methodically moved wallboard into a new storefront on West 33rd Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''This is nothing,'' he said. ''I'm sweating too much to freeze.''</p>
        <p>For an April snowstorm, ''this one was unusual for its accumulation, thanks to the large amount of unseasonably cold air in the area,'' said Tim Morrin, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>Snow falling in April is not a rarity, ''but people are right in thinking that April snow that actually sticks is rare,'' said Stephen Fybish, a Manhattan climate researcher. ''Nine of the last 20 Aprils have had at least some snowflakes. But only four have had measurable snow.''</p>
        <p>From Connecticut to the New Jersey Highlands, villages and towns that had spent down their snow-removal budgets somehow found the resources to rev up plows and saltspreaders, while merchants hauled out their snowy wares.</p>
        <p>''We have a couple of shovels, but all the snow-melt was gone even before the Presidents' Day blizzard,'' said Victor Ash, proprietor of M. J. Hardware in Eighth Avenue in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>For a time yesterday, the snow did not stick on still-warm pavements and roads. But the greater accumulations on lawns and shrubs drove customers to frantically call garden stores about budding shrubs and droopy daffodils.</p>
        <p>''I told everyone that the snow works as an insulator,'' said Tim Hanrahan, a manager at Ploch's Home and Garden Center in Clifton, N.J. ''They could damage their buds by knocking off the snow.''</p>
        <p>Those in traditional areas of hefty snow accumulation evidenced a wise-cracking stoicism. ''We don't think we're home free until April 15,'' said Estelle Anderson, who lives 900 feet up on a ridge in Kinnelon, N.J. ''But today, the robins are very annoyed. They can't get at their worms.''</p>
        <p>Another annoyed redbreast was encountered at Buena Vista, a nine-hole golf course in West Hartford, Conn. The lone figure on the stormy fairway was a barrel-chested, red-vested golfer who took six shots out of a soggy bunker. ''Tough winter for golf,'' said the man, who gave his name only as Mark.</p>
        <p>In Suffolk County, Marie Banks chose to think of the weather as ''a little setback'' on her farm in Ridge. The snow made it difficult to work her six horses, already shedding their winter coats.</p>
        <p>Many people looked unprepared for the stinging winds and surprising cold. ''I've pretty much adjusted to spring,'' said one commuter, Chris Jay, as he waited, hatless, in his beige spring sport jacket, for the ferry in Hoboken, N.J.</p>
        <p>The snow was actually a naturalistic boon to crews from the television series ''Law and Order,'' which happened to be shooting its 300th episode outdoors on Riverside Drive in Manhattan yesterday and ''was able to capitalize on mother nature,'' said Katherine Oliver, commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting.</p>
        <p>And Jeff Zacharia, president of Zachys Wine and Liquor in Scarsdale, N.Y., said that from the moment his doors opened, foot traffic was up 10 percent from that on a normal day, and average sales were up 25 percent.</p>
