        <p>With Saddam Hussein deposed from Baghdad and Iraqis increasingly voicing gratitude to intervening American troops, the earliest and fiercest advocates of the war claimed vindication today.</p>
        <p>Chief among them was Ken Adelman, a former arms control director in the Reagan administration, who predicted in February of last year that American forces would enjoy ''a cakewalk'' in Iraq.</p>
        <p>That remark, with similar predictions by other hawkish former and current government officials, was ridiculed by a flood of commentators and retired generals in the early days of the war in Southern Iraq, when Mr. Hussein's paramilitary fighters seemed to be putting up stiffer-than-expected resistance.</p>
        <p>Today, in an opinion piece in The Washington Post with the headline '' 'Cakewalk' Revisited'' and in an interview, Mr. Adelman fired back. ''What a difference a week makes,'' he wrote. ''The chump-to-champ cycle usually takes longer, even in Washington.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adelman, reached in Paris today, said the critics of the war plan could not argue with success. He scorned recent complaints by retired generals and military analysts that the Pentagon had deployed too few troops or was seeking to take over Iraq ''on the cheap.''</p>
        <p>''I always thought that was ridiculous,'' Mr. Adelman said. ''It turned out they were factually wrong. I never understood what having three times as many troops would have done.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Adelman said he hoped that ''fearmongers'' would derive some lessons about leadership from the seizure of Baghdad. President Bush had not been dissuaded by the criticism, and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain boldly stared down public opinion in his country, he said.</p>
        <p>''I hope it emboldens leaders to drastic, not measured, approaches,'' Mr. Adelman said. ''That's the only way to make a difference in the world.''</p>
        <p>But friends say that, as recently as last week, Mr. Adelman, who was assistant to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld from 1975 to 1977, was less sanguine about the military's progress in the early days of the war, and seemed a bit nervous about his original ''cakewalk'' prediction.</p>
        <p>And in an interview with The New York Times late last month, Mr. Adelman said he regretted his remarks. ''I think that the phrase 'cakewalk' was too glib,'' he said. ''It was too easy and not applicable to a kind of wartime situation.''</p>
        <p>Other prominent supporters of the war also had reputations to protect: Richard N. Perle, who recently resigned as chairman of the Defense Policy Board, called the Iraqi regime ''a house of cards'' last year, and Paul D. Wolfowitz, Mr. Rumsfeld's top deputy, predicted that the Iraqi people would greet Americans as liberators.</p>
        <p>In interviews today, other hawks were as jubilant as Mr. Adelman. William Kristol, the editor of the conservative Weekly Standard and a strong supporter of the war, said he had been deeply affected by the images of the statue of Mr. Hussein tumbling in downtown Baghdad, which he compared to the fall of the Berlin Wall. ''I was moved and relieved,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A former aide to Vice President Dan Quayle, Mr. Kristol said the American victory in Iraq could go far to dispel some of the self-doubt and isolationist impulses brought on by the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>''This is the most significant military action since Vietnam,'' he said. While not on the same scale as that war, he added, ''This is a little bit of a Vietnam in reverse, I would argue.''</p>
        <p>William J. Bennett, another early advocate of the war, said the United States was on the verge of an extraordinary rout of a totalitarian system, and close to capturing a nation the size of California with minimal troops.</p>
        <p>''This will go down as one of the great military efforts of all time,'' said Mr. Bennett, who was education secretary and drug czar under President Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush.</p>
        <p>Still, he said the military success would not, for some critics, provide a justification for the war. He predicted that the challenges would resume before the guns are silent.</p>
        <p>''The argument will proceed,'' he said. Skeptics in Europe and within academic circles in this country, he said, will say, ''Sure, you have big bombs, but what about cultural sensitivities and tolerance and understanding?''</p>
        <p>''The cognitive dissonance continues,'' he said. ''Our own intellectuals don't get it.''</p>
        <p>At least one of the retired military officers who criticized the Pentagon plan has done an about-face. Gen. Barry M. McCaffrey, who led a mechanized infantry division in the first gulf war, said early on that Mr. Rumsfeld had sent too few troops into battle and added: ''I know a lot more about fighting than he does.''</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey, who was traveling and could not be reached for comment today, distanced himself from his earlier criticism. In interview on CNBC's Kudlow and Cramer, he hinted at contrition.</p>
        <p>''Generals and admirals are all worriers,'' he said, then went on to say that the American drive had been ''executed brilliantly.''</p>
