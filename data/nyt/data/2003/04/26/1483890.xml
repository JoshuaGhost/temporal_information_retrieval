        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he has offered to give a ticker-tape parade up lower Broadway for the American troops returning from the war in Iraq, and is waiting for a response from Washington.</p>
        <p>After the first gulf war, on June 10, 1991, 10,000 veterans turned out for a New York City parade that drew, according to police estimates, 4.7 million people who lined the one-mile route from Battery Park to Worth Street. At the time, it was called the largest crowd for any single event in city history.</p>
        <p>Even though members of the City Council passed a resolution urging President Bush to use all means to avoid a war and thousands of New Yorkers protested the war with Iraq, Mr. Bloomberg said he believed the city would still like to express its gratitude for the troops' sacrifices.</p>
        <p>''These are the young men and women who put their lives at risk for the rest of us,'' Mr. Bloomberg said during his weekly WABC-AM (770) radio show.</p>
        <p>''Whether you agreed with the war or not is not the issue. They went over, did what we asked them to do very well and, tragically, some did not come back alive.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bloomberg said his request to salute the troops has already run into a few problems.</p>
        <p>''One of the problems is the troops aren't coming back all at once; it's not 'Johnny Comes Marching Home Again' after a big war,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg added: ''Keeping the peace is going to be a difficult and long process, putting in a democratic government and giving them an infrastructure. It's unclear how we're going to do this or when. But the city would like to say thank you. So the ball's in the Pentagon's court.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bloomberg also said owners of several Broadway theaters have said they want to offer thanks of a different kind: free tickets to shows to the troops who are from New York City. At this point, it is unclear how many tickets will be distributed.</p>
        <p>Calls to the Pentagon seeking comment were not returned.</p>
        <p>But even with the Pentagon's support, Mr. Bloomberg said he still faces the challenge of securing funding for the parade.</p>
        <p>''Traditionally you get somebody to donate the money to pay for it,'' he said. ''The city doesn't have any money to do these kinds of things. We'll find some ways to do it.''</p>
