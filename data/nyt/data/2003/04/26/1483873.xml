        <p>Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the former wife of Nelson Mandela, was sentenced today to four years in prison on dozens of counts of theft and fraud.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Ms. Madikizela-Mandela, one of the most powerful leaders in the fight against apartheid, was convicted for her part in a scheme to steal more than $100,000 from false bank loans and funeral policies.</p>
        <p>Many of the loans had been granted to poor people, who would not have qualified without signed letters from Ms. Madikizela-Mandela. In sentencing today, however, the judge, Peet Johnson, made clear that she also profited from the deals.</p>
        <p>Addy Moolman, a broker and business associate, was sentenced to seven years in prison, with two years suspended. He and Ms. Madikizela-Mandela said they would appeal.</p>
        <p>The judge said Ms. Madikizela-Mandela could be released on parole after eight months in prison and be required to perform community service for the remainder of her term. His long explanatory statement revealed the weight of the judgment on the court and the country.</p>
        <p>Judge Johnson acknowledged Ms. Madikizela-Mandela's contributions to the building of South Africa's first full democracy. During the 27 years that Mr. Mandela was in prison and other black leaders lived in exile, Ms. Madikizela-Mandela helped keep up their work at home, despite attacks and torture. Once Mr. Mandela was released, his wife came to be called the Mother of the Nation.</p>
        <p>''Only a fool would underplay the important role you have played in this country,'' Judge Johnson said.</p>
        <p>But he said, ''Somewhere, it seems, something went wrong.'' He said Ms. Madikizela-Mandela had acted as if her status as an icon of freedom had put her above the law.</p>
        <p>''This court must send an example that no one enjoys such privilege,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Wearing a flowing white caftan with a white beaded headband, Ms. Madikizela-Mandela, 66, did not speak about the sentence and appeared calm, laughing with relatives and friends. But she issued a written statement indicating that she would withdraw for now from public life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Madikizela-Mandela said she would resign her seat in Parliament, the presidency of the African National Congress Women's League and her membership on the A.N.C. executive council. ''I intend to spend my time henceforth to do the work that I started in my early life and to bind my destiny with everyone with whom I share the ideals of a just South Africa,'' she wrote.</p>
        <p>This trial was the latest in a series of scandals that have tarnished Ms. Madikizela-Mandela's image since white-minority rule ended nearly a decade ago. In 1991, Ms. Madikizela-Mandela was convicted of kidnapping and of being an accessory to assault in connection with the death of a 15-year-old township boy. She and Mr. Mandela separated shortly afterward, and they divorced in 1996.</p>
        <p>She had been removed from Mr. Mandela's cabinet following charges of impropriety and was sued for her failure to make mortgage payments for the elegant home she had built in Soweto township. Ms. Madikizela-Mandela, who is widely considered a champion of the poor, was elected to Parliament in 1994. But in recent months its leaders have sought to fine her for failing to appear for duty.</p>
        <p>Today's proceedings were the focus of intense public scrutiny, with hundreds of supporters standing vigil outside the courtroom and with newspapers and radio waves full of debate about whether Ms. Madikizela-Mandela should go to jail.</p>
