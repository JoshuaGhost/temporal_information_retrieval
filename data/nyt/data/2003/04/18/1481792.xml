        <p>Rabbit-Proof Fence</p>
        <p>For more than half a century the Australian government sought to hasten the disappearance of the Aborigines by forcibly removing children of mixed marriages from their families and and turning them into household servants and farm laborers. As executor of the policy in Phillip Noyce's film, A. O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) promotes it with a certainty that would make Rudyard Kipling seem benign. Fleeing that fate, three young girls make a 1,200-mile trek following a rabbit-proof fence that runs the length of the country. ''In Mr. Noyce's hands their journey is touched with enchantment'' (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>2002. Miraax. VHS, $103.99; DVD, $29.99. 95 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.</p>

        <p>Spirited Away</p>
        <p>In Hayao Miyazaki's epic and marvelous anime fantasy, young Chihiro (voice of Daveigh Chase) finds herself in a lost world that resembles an amusement park. Strange and threatening creatures are encountered in this Oscar-winning film as Chihiro struggles with her fears and learns to shift for herself in a land of illusion.</p>
        <p>''No one else conjures the phantasmagoric and shifting morality of dreams -- that frightening aspect of having something that seems to represent good become evil -- in the way this master Japanese animator does,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>2002. Disney. VHS, $19.99; DVD, $29.99. 125 minutes. PG.</p>
