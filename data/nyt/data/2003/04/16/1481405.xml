        <p>Four police officers in Bloomfield, N.J., were charged yesterday with fatally injuring a man by subduing him as he suffered an epileptic seizure at work, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>On the eve of the first anniversary of the death, an Essex County grand jury indicted the four officers on a charge of manslaughter, contending they recklessly caused the death of the man, Santiago Villanueva, a 35-year-old garment worker and folk musician from the Dominican Republic, officials said.</p>
        <p>The officers were identified as Richard Chiarello, 43, Vincent DeFabrizio, 44, Frank Furfaro, 37, and Gerald Filippone, 32. They were not taken into custody yesterday, and no date has been set for their initial appearance in New Jersey Superior Court. What, if any, action the Bloomfield Police Department has taken against them was unclear. The police chief, John McNiff, did not respond to messages left at his office, and other officials declined to comment.</p>
        <p>An autopsy last year found that Mr. Villanueva died on April 16, 2002, of ''mechanical asphyxia following physical restraint.'' Subsequently, the death was classified as a homicide by the regional medical examiner's office in Newark.</p>
        <p>The death touched off several protests last spring by the Rev. Al Sharpton, members of the victim's family and Dominican community groups in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where Mr. Villanueva had lived for nine years.</p>
        <p>The four officers were sent to a Bloomfield garment factory where Mr. Villanueva worked after he suffered a seizure and co-workers called 911. Bloomfield police officials said last spring that Mr. Villanueva was combative and that the four officers used force to restrain him because they feared he would hurt himself or others.</p>
        <p>Susan M. Karten, a lawyer for Mr. Villanueva's family, offered a different version of the incident last spring. She contended that the officers yelled at him to speak in English, not Spanish, and accused him of being on drugs because he was foaming at the mouth. The officers wrestled him to the floor, and one applied pressure to his back and another to his neck, Ms. Karten said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the Essex County prosecutor, Donald C. Campolo, said in a statement that the officers had inflicted the fatal injuries while subduing Mr. Villanueva so they could take him by ambulance to a hospital. He declined to give other details. Mr. Campolo said Mr. Villanueva died shortly after arriving at Columbus Hospital in Newark.</p>
        <p>Under New Jersey's law on manslaughter, a person acts recklessly when he disregards the risk that his act could cause another person's death, Mr. Campolo said. ''The risk must be a gross deviation from the standard on conduct that a reasonable person would follow in the same situation,'' his statement said. Manslaughter carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Villanueva's widow, Lisa Aann, 39, a caterer in Greenwich Village, said yesterday that the indictment gave her ''a little relief.'' But she said she was surprised that the officers had not been suspended during the investigation. ''This whole year they were working,'' she said. ''No remorse, no apology, no nothing. It's been very difficult this year. I just need justice for my husband.''</p>
