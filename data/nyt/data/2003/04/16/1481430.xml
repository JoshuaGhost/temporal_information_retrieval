        <p>An American team hunting for unconventional Iraqi weapons at an ammunition manufacturing and storage plant near Karbala have discovered some suspicious items, but appeared to have come away yet again without the ''smoking gun'' proving that Iraq made chemical, biological or nuclear materials here.</p>
        <p>The team found radioactive material in a maintenance building and ''dual use'' biological equipment that could be used for peaceful or military purposes buried in metal containers under huge mounds of gravel and dirt.</p>
        <p>Col. Richard McPhee, commander of the 75th Exploitation Task Force, a Defense Department unit responsible for the search for unconventional weapons, took a specialized nuclear detection team to the site today and removed seven canisters containing a radioactive isotope of cesium from the huge maintenance warehouse.</p>
        <p>Although analysts have not yet determined its specific purpose, the experts said they thought that the cesium was probably intended to calibrate machinery in one of the many new buildings and production facilities that were under construction here.</p>
        <p>Ending a weeklong survey here today, the American experts said the nature and specific purpose of parts of this giant installation remained a mystery. The purpose may not be known for weeks, as intelligence analysts in Washington pore over the detailed maps, engineering drawings and inventories of equipment -- about 1,000 pounds of documents that were found and removed.</p>
        <p>The experts said they continued to regard the plant as suspicious.</p>
        <p>But after a week of intensive work in which expectations of finding proof of unconventional weapons that Washington insists exists soared and were repeatedly deflated, the military experts said the survey had shown only how difficult it is likely to be to discover hard evidence of production of prohibited weapons without specific information from Iraqi scientists and military officers.</p>
        <p>The plant near here was one of Iraq's leading ammunition production sites, but much of it was under construction when the war began and it became a target of American bombs. Although international inspectors visited the plant as late as February, they failed to find biological or chemical weapons or agents here.</p>
        <p>After the war began, the site was visited by advancing American troops, who reported finding nothing of special interest to weapons inspectors. But because the site was considered sensitive, officials in Washington said an Army specialist team was also sent to the plant.</p>
        <p>That team, too, missed the buried containers and the dual-use equipment, as well as the canisters of radioactive material, which unlike the large buried containers were stored openly at a maintenance site.</p>
        <p>Not until American combat forces came by a second time, more than a week ago, were the first 2 of what turned to be a total of 11 sealed containers found.</p>
        <p>Contrary to instructions about what to do in such situations, the soldiers opened one of the containers, then moved on, leaving only a small chemical platoon in charge of safeguarding the material and securing this huge, five-square-mile installation.</p>
        <p>Word that the plant was open to pillage spread quickly through surrounding impoverished villages, several of which have been without electricity, medicine and even water since the war began. By the time the Defense Department specialist unit arrived, much had already been looted.</p>
        <p>For instance, the experts found manuals that came with two drying ovens imported from Germany, equipment that can be used to culture viruses and bacteria for weapons. But the ovens themselves were gone by the time the specialists arrived.</p>
        <p>The weapons experts quickly determined that the containers held expensive, highly sophisticated equipment imported from Germany, Italy, China, Britain and other countries that could be used for military or civilian purposes. An intense survey began of the roughly 50 large buildings on the complex.</p>
        <p>A special focus of the team's efforts was a 50-foot-long, 5-foot-high mound of packed dirt and gravel. Ground-penetrating radar indicated that objects had been buried beneath the mound.</p>
        <p>Lacking earth-moving equipment, the team hired laborers from the nearby village of Ayyash. With the laborers' shovels, bolstered later by a farmer with a tractor and another man with a front-end loader, the team began digging out the mound. But the effort, which took more than a day, went for naught -- the team found nothing under the mound.</p>
        <p>The 75th Exploitation Task Force, camped farther south in Iraq, has struggled to carry out its mission as Washington's attention has shifted from forbidden weapons, the ostensible reason for the United States' decision to go to war, to war crimes committed by the Iraqis after the war began.</p>
        <p>Resources, including communications equipment, security, engineers and even basic supplies like generators and batteries, have often not been available. Helicopter transport, essential for rapid mobility in such a large country, has been sporadic, and the weapons teams have had to scrounge vehicles from other units to travel to suspected sites of unconventional weapons.</p>
        <p>People who have monitored the search in Iraq also say there have been several problems with the Army site survey teams overreacting or underreacting to discoveries in the field.</p>
        <p>Chief Warrant Officer Richard L. Gonzales, the leader of the Defense Department weapons specialist team here, minimized the inspectors' problems and said he remained convinced that proof of unconventional Iraqi weapons would be found eventually.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to find just a smoking gun, but a smoking cannon,'' he said. ''It's only a matter of time.''</p>
