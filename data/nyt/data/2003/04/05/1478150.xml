        <p>South Korea's biggest companies and banks began pouring about $4 billion into their credit card companies today as part of a government-driven plan to rescue them from bankruptcy and stave off another economic crisis.</p>
        <p>Under intense government pressure, Samsung Electronics led the offensive, pledging to invest another $100 million in the Samsung Card Company by the end of June in what it told shareholders was ''the best course of action in what are difficult circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Other credit card companies joined the parade, disclosing some of their plans at a news conference staged by the Financial Supervisory Service, the regulatory body that instituted the plan. It calls for financial institutions to cover more than $8 billion in debts that are falling due this quarter on bonds issued by credit card companies.</p>
        <p>An official at the Financial Supervisory Service said a wide range of institutions had agreed on the urgent need for a bailout plan because of rising oil prices and the North Korean nuclear crisis.</p>
        <p>The need for such a plan comes after repeated government warnings that South Korea's nine credit card companies were far overextending credit to consumers after having tightened up on credit for companies during the economic crisis of 1997 and 1998.</p>
        <p>As an example of the spending trend among South Korean consumers, the Bank of Korea said today that South Koreans had charged $2.45 billion to their credit cards while traveling abroad last year compared with $1.94 billion in 2001. Unpaid credit card balances in March totaled $2.34 billion, up 27.5 percent from March 2001.</p>
        <p>The high-risk plan dramatizes the symbiotic relationship between government and business in South Korea, with the public and private sectors traditionally working together, under strong central guidance, to ward off a crisis. In the case of the current credit card problem, officials rejected comparisons with the crisis that forced the government to ask the International Monetary Fund to organize a $58 billion bailout package in 1997.</p>
        <p>With more than $10 billion in debts falling due over the next three months, however, officials believed they had no choice but to compel banks, insurance companies and securities firms to join in the program for guaranteeing the viability of bonds issued by the credit card companies. They are to step into the breach created by the inability of investment trust companies to trade credit card company bonds after it was learned that SK Global, the trading arm of the SK Group, South Korea's third-largest conglomerate, covered up $1.2 billion in debt.</p>
