        <p>After months of foot-dragging, the effort to build a professional sports arena in Newark for the Nets and Devils has a new face, a new consultant and, according to some, a new momentum. The new face is a board committee of the YankeeNets responsible for negotiating the specifics of the deal. The new consultant, Sportscorp Ltd., is a Chicago-based firm that specializes in sports centers and franchises.</p>
        <p>So now the YankeeNets board committee has three non-New Jerseyans -- Alan Landis, David Gerstein and Mort Olshan. Conspicuously absent is Raymond Chambers, the New Jersey philanthropist who had championed the idea of a Newark arena for the teams as a way of revitalizing the state's largest city. Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, would not comment on Mr. Chambers's absence.</p>

        <p>After months of foot-dragging, the effort to build a professional sports arena in Newark for the Nets and Devils has a new face, a new consultant and, according to some, a new momentum. The new face is a board committee of the YankeeNets responsible for negotiating the specifics of the deal. The new consultant, Sportscorp Ltd., is a Chicago-based firm that specializes in sports centers and franchises.</p>
        <p>So now the YankeeNets board committee has three non-New Jerseyans -- Alan Landis, David Gerstein and Mort Olshan. Conspicuously absent is Raymond Chambers, the New Jersey philanthropist who had championed the idea of a Newark arena for the teams as a way of revitalizing the state's largest city. Marc Ganis, president of Sportscorp, would not comment on Mr. Chambers's absence.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ganis did note that there had been a board member who had ''stuck his neck out to do something for the community who didn't get any credit.'' The approach now, he said, was ''to look at this more as an economic deal rather than something whose majority focus was a civic good.''</p>
        <p>To that end, the committee and their consultants will be meeting with city and state officials this week to press them into service on getting corporate commitments around the state to lease luxury suites and boxes at the proposed 18,000-seat arena. Mr. Ganis said commitments on the planned 126 suites, or club boxes --which cost an average $250,000 to $325,000 a year -- are essential to make the project economically competitive.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the only thing that has not changed from the time Mr. Chambers pushed for the arena under three governors, said Mr. Ganis, is ''that we are still not having any discussions with any other location.''</p>
