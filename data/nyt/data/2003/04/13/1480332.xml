        <p>James R Oestreich says EMI is foolish for not making use of marketing opportunities in US for its five-CD set of Beethoven symphonies, with Simon Rattle conducting Vienna Philharmonic; photo (S)</p>

        <p>Is it a harbinger of salvation for the foundering classical record business or simply a mellifluous tombstone? EMI has just put a five-CD set of the nine Beethoven symphonies, with Simon Rattle conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, on the European market, and many are proclaiming it a test case, however unfair the burden.</p>
        <p>A major success, the thinking goes, would show that you can still sell new versions of the most overrecorded repertory, if the circumstances are carefully chosen. But if even these perennially newsworthy artists, in a provocative combination, cannot produce a blockbuster (by modest classical standards), then all hope for anything but niche recording may be lost.</p>

        <p>Is it a harbinger of salvation for the foundering classical record business or simply a mellifluous tombstone? EMI has just put a five-CD set of the nine Beethoven symphonies, with Simon Rattle conducting the Vienna Philharmonic, on the European market, and many are proclaiming it a test case, however unfair the burden.</p>
        <p>A major success, the thinking goes, would show that you can still sell new versions of the most overrecorded repertory, if the circumstances are carefully chosen. But if even these perennially newsworthy artists, in a provocative combination, cannot produce a blockbuster (by modest classical standards), then all hope for anything but niche recording may be lost.</p>
        <p>The combination is provocative because Sir Simon, through his explorations of early music and new music, has evolved a mercurial style rooted in flexibility, clarity and detail, and the Vienna Philharmonic, with its inherent warmth and richness, represents solid tradition in this repertory. At a quick first hearing, the performances offer much to ponder.</p>
        <p>But musical issues aside, from the American perspective the grand experiment seems almost set up to fail. Despite the wave of interest and publicity already rolling in Europe, EMI plans to release the set in the United States only in November, when Sir Simon comes calling with the Berlin Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>There is a slight perversity here, because plans for the recording proved a sore spot for the Berlin Philharmonic in its hiring of Sir Simon as music director. The Vienna recording will undoubtedly prevent the Berlin Philharmonic from taking another crack of its own at the Beethoven symphonies any time soon, at least with the glamorous and bankable Sir Simon.</p>
        <p>More to the point in an industry fighting for its life, EMI seems oblivious to the marketing opportunities afforded by globalization. Surely, few collectors avid for the set will await American release in November when they can easily buy it now from Amazon.com ($45) or another source. It will be old news by then. You have to hope that the demise of the major classical labels will not be, as well.</p>
