        <p>GOOD teachers never let students see them sweat, and use fun props like dodge balls to explain difficult principles of mass and motion. Bad teachers play favorites and worry more about enforcing dress codes than making ''Henry IV'' interesting. Such conclusions fill the pages of ''Fires in the Bathroom: Advice for Teachers From High School Students,'' to be published May 1.</p>
        <p>In the book, produced by the nonprofit education group What Kids Can Do, 40 students from New York City, Providence, R.I., and the San Francisco Bay Area turn the tables on adults and tell them how to do their jobs. The title comes from one teenager's tale of a first-year high school teacher whose authority was ignored because she was too nice. Sensing fear, students turned her classroom into chaos. ''And then they set fires in the bathroom, while she was trying to be so friendly,'' says Lauraliz Rivera of the Bronx.</p>
