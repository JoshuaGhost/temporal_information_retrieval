        <p>DeWayne Barrett's victory in the 400 meters served as a send-off for the St. John's men's team at the 70th annual Metropolitan Intercollegiate Track and Field Championships yesterday at Columbia's Wien Stadium.</p>
        <p>Because St. John's is eliminating its men's team, this outdoor season has become the Red Storm's farewell tour. It will leave the sport as the repeat Met champion, compiling 115 points to beat Columbia (104), New York Tech (97) and 12 other teams.</p>
        <p>Rutgers totaled 180 points to take the women's crown over Columbia (146) and St. John's (116).</p>
        <p>''All of us are pretty mad about what's happened; there's a lot of talent here, talent that's doing big things this year and would have done bigger things next year,'' said Barrett, a junior from Jamaica. He finished third in the 200 and ran a leg on the winning 4x400 relay team (3 minutes 12.43 seconds.)</p>
        <p>St. John's is dropping track and four other men's teams in an effort to make the ratio of male to female athletes reflect enrollment more closely.</p>
        <p>The men's 400 was the day's feature event. Long Island University's Richard James, also of Jamaica, led until Barrett passed him in the final meters. Barrett won in 46.46 seconds; James finished in 46.49.</p>
        <p>Columbia won both 1,500-meter titles as Steve Sundell (3:55.22) led the men and Melissa Stellato (4:30.69) the women.</p>
        <p>Shameka Marshall of Rutgers won the women's 100 hurdles (14.28) and long jump (19 feet 9 inches) and was second in the triple jump.</p>
