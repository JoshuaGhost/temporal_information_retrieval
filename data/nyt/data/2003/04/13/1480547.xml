        <p>TOBACCO bonds have taken a beating. But are they cheap enough to buy?</p>
        <p>The managers of Thornburg Investment Management's tax-exempt municipal bond funds are asking that question, after shunning tobacco bonds since they first appeared in 1999. If those managers are taking a look, investors with a stomach for risk and some cash to spare should take heed.</p>
        <p>About $18 billion in tobacco bonds have been issued by states and municipalities, backed by $206 billion that is expected to flow over 25 years from the four major tobacco companies as a result of a 1998 settlement. So far, 17 states and many local governments have borrowed millions to billions of dollars to spend now against that future revenue.</p>
        <p>Since March 21, however, these bonds have been plummeting, with some prices down 12 to 14 percent. The selling started when investors suddenly became troubled by what Thornburg money managers had worried about all along: the continued ability of the tobacco companies to make the payments to the states that cover the principal and interest on these bonds.</p>
        <p>The doubts became widespread after a $10.1 billion judgment in Illinois against the Philip Morris unit of the Altria Group; the company said it might have to file for bankruptcy if it had to post a $12 billion bond to appeal the verdict. Its credit rating dropped to the low end of investment grade. The ratings on the outstanding tobacco bonds were cut by two notches, prompting Virginia to cancel its $767 million tobacco bond sale and California to delay its $2.3 billion sale scheduled for this week.</p>
        <p>Josh Gonze, assistant portfolio manager at Thornburg in Santa Fe, N.M., couldn't help but sound a little ''I told you so'' as he talked about the tobacco bond plunge. But when asked about buying bonds whose price had now dropped to 78 cents on the dollar, he said, ''at this time we say no, but that does not mean we are not tempted.''</p>
        <p>A tax-exempt yield of 7.5 percent is alluring; it is, after all, equivalent to a taxable yield of 12.2 percent for investors in the top federal tax bracket. And at current prices, there is opportunity for big capital gains.</p>
        <p>But before adding tobacco bonds to the $2 billion in Thornburg's six muni funds, Mr. Gonze said that prices must fall below 70 cents and that the outlook for continued payments from the tobacco companies must improve. ''At a minimum,'' he said, ''that means that Philip Morris has to stay out of bankruptcy and there has to be no interruption in tobacco payments to the states.''</p>
        <p>It appears that Philip Morris, with help from the judge in the case or the Illinois Legislature, will not have to pay the full $12 billion bond to appeal. As for the payment to the states, Philip Morris is scheduled to make its next one by Tuesday, so the outlook could soon be clearer.</p>
        <p>Ronald H. Fielding, the head of the municipal bond team for OppenheimerFunds' Rochester family of funds, also said that there was value in the bonds. He holds about $800 million of them, scattered among the nine funds he oversees. There is a little over $500 million of them in the $5.8 billion Rochester Fund Municipals, whose net asset value fell as much as 1 percent in the tobacco bond sell-off. (Another favorite holding, airline bonds, contributed to the decline.)</p>
        <p>INVESTORS with an appetite for the tobacco bonds may want to consider another problem: the high markups that are being tacked onto the bonds by dealers when they sell to retail customers.</p>
        <p>''Dealers often will buy a bond from a retail customer and mark it up three to six points in selling it to another customer,'' Mr. Fielding told reporters in a conference call last week.</p>
        <p>Trading data from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the industry's self-regulatory body, showed dealer purchases of New Jersey tobacco bonds from customers at prices as low as 71 cents on the dollar on April 1 and sales to customers the same day at prices as high as 90 cents on the dollar.</p>
        <p>So it could be doubly hard for an individual investor to get the sub-70-cent price that Thornburg money managers would consider a value.</p>
