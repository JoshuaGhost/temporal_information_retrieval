        <p>Fifteen days ago, a 20-year-old soldier said, Baath Party officials surrounded his home in southern Iraq, tied his hands behind his back and took him away as his mother wept.</p>
        <p>Today, the soldier is hundreds of miles to the north, wounded and alone, a prisoner in a hospital in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.</p>
        <p>''I am not afraid,'' he said from his bed here, while Kurdish soldiers stood guard. ''I only miss my father and mother.''</p>
        <p>With nearly all of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard divisions shifted south for the defense of Baghdad, most of an estimated 100,000 army conscripts like this one are left manning the front lines in northern Iraq.</p>
        <p>An interview with this soldier, who refused to give his name for fear of reprisal against his family, offers a glimpse of life in Iraq's low-paid and ill-equipped regular army. Here in the north the soldiers are facing increasingly fierce bombardment from American and British planes and, at least in this case, death threats from Iraqi officers.</p>
        <p>While none of the soldier's account could be independently verified, his physical state -- gaunt, battered and pallid -- was a testament, at least, to his suffering.</p>
        <p>The soldier deserted from the army two years ago, he said, during his mandatory military service. Before he was arrested by the Baath officials last month, he had spent two years in hiding in his parents' home.</p>
        <p>After his arrest, the young man was quickly taken to a nearby military base and given a rifle, and he was then shipped out with a unit to northern Iraq. There, the unit frequently changed positions, an effort, according to Kurdish officials, to limit the number of soldiers surrendering.</p>
        <p>His life settled into a grim routine. The American bombing was fiercest in the morning and afternoon. ''I can't count them,'' he said, referring to airstrikes. ''I can tell you in just one day you are getting out of the bunker 10 to 15 times.''</p>
        <p>Their rations were meager, rice and bread. He had no appetite. ''Death was always upon our heads,'' he said. ''We never could eat.'' Many of his fellow soldiers wanted to desert, he said he believed.</p>
        <p>Officers repeatedly pointed out a group of menacing military intelligence officials stationed behind him. They threatened the soldiers, saying, ''If you run, this is the execution squad.'' But he never witnessed an execution, he said.</p>
        <p>The young soldier is not sure how he got to the hospital. Doctors say a piece of shrapnel -- maybe from an American bomb, maybe from a fellow Iraqi soldier's weapon -- ripped a small hole in his head Tuesday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Today, he complained of ''terrible headaches'' and of not being able to feel the left side of his body.</p>
        <p>Curling his wiry body beneath a blanket, he appeared spent. A large bandage covered his head. An intravenous tube jutted from his sticklike arm. A scrape on his chin and a streak of dried blood on his nose marred his boyish face.</p>
        <p>But he was composed, speaking in a soft and steady voice and pausing only occasionally to complain about pain. He should recover, his doctor said.</p>
        <p>Despite all the suffering in Iraq, the soldier doubted that much would change.</p>
        <p>His only concern, he added, was contacting his family. ''I am very worried about my father and mother,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The last thing the soldier said he remembered was following his commander's order for defending against an American air attack. He and other conscripts left their bunkers, spread out across an open area and lay face down on the ground. As allied jets roared overhead, he put his hands on top of his head and waited. He did not pray, he said. He thought of one thing: ''death, nothing else.''</p>
