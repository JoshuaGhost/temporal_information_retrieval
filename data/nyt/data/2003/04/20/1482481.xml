        <p>Imagine an outpost of 370 acres of prime real estate on the North Shore of Long Island with to-die-for views of Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>And imagine that this remote tract, the largest piece of undeveloped real estate in the town of Smithtown, is just possibly part of Brooklyn, about 50 miles away.</p>
        <p>For more than a century, the site was home to the Kings Park Psychiatric Center, and today it is an environmental nightmare. The property, just east of Sunken Meadow State Park, is dotted with abandoned buildings and acres of landfill that are laced with asbestos and lead paint from demolished and buried buildings.</p>
        <p>The history of the relationship between Kings Park and New York City goes back to 1885, when Kings County, otherwise known as Brooklyn, was a city. It bought the property and opened up a Long Island branch of the Kings County Lunatic Asylum. The bucolic site was a perfect place for a working farm where Brooklyn could care for its ''paupers, the insane, and other county wards.'' according to an 1893 article.</p>
        <p>But in 1895, responding to scandal and corruption at the hospital, the state took the hospital and the land from Brooklyn for $1. Brooklyn lost all connection to the property except the hospital's name.</p>
        <p>But after the state closed the hospital in 1996, local residents uncovered a long-forgotten clause in the 1895 deed stipulating that the property be used ''forever solely for the use of a state hospital for the insane.'' State officials say that could mean that if the state stopped using the land for this purpose, the land would revert to Kings County.</p>
        <p>Despite the murky ownership, the state received several bids for the property last week, and state officials hope to resolve the matter soon. ''Talks are moving forward with the city and we expect a resolution shortly,'' said Alexander Dudley, a spokesman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state agency handling the sale.</p>
        <p>But this month, before state officials apprised the city of the complexities in the deed, officials from Mayor Bloomberg to the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz, said through their offices that they didn't even know where Kings Park was, much less that the city might own it.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the city's Law Department, Kate O'Brien Ahlers, said that city lawyers were working on the case but were not available to comment.</p>
        <p>It may be a gift no one in the city really wants. ''It's been state property for more than 100 years,'' said Leo Polaski, a historian for the state hospital. ''But laws being what they are and goofiness being what it is, maybe it really could revert to the city.''</p>
