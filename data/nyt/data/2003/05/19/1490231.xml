        <p>The new Middle East peace effort stalled today, after a barrage of four Palestinian attacks killed nine bystanders, prompting Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to postpone a trip to see President Bush and to decide that Israel would shun foreign representatives who met with Yasir Arafat, Israeli officials said.</p>
        <p>After convening his cabinet tonight, Mr. Sharon issued an implicit repudiation of a new international peace plan, which calls for simultaneous concessions by both sides and rapid political progress to achieve peace and a Palestinian state in just three years.</p>
        <p>''Peace can only be achieved after terror has been eradicated and there is quiet here,'' read a statement released by Mr. Sharon's office. ''Only then will we be able to make progress through political channels.''</p>
        <p>Israel imposed a ''general closure'' on the West Bank, barring any Palestinians from crossing the boundary with Israel.</p>
        <p>Despite the violence, Mr. Sharon told his cabinet ministers tonight that he intended to continue meeting with the first Palestinian prime minister, Mahmoud Abbas, Israeli officials said.</p>
        <p>At least two of the attacks appeared to be the work of militants from Hamas, which opposes any negotiations with Israel. But at the cabinet meeting, ministers reviewed information implicating Mr. Arafat, Israeli officials said, without disclosing details. Mr. Arafat dismissed the accusation as propaganda and, in a telephone interview with Fox News, condemned violence against civilians.</p>
        <p>Since December 2001, Israel has tried to isolate Mr. Arafat internationally, but it had not instituted a policy of ignoring all foreigners who meet with him. Israeli officials said the ban would apply only during the visit in which any offending official saw Mr. Arafat. They said it would not apply to five visits that were already planned, including one by the French foreign minister, Dominique de Villepin.</p>
        <p>The Bush administration has not sent officials to meet Mr. Arafat since last June.</p>
        <p>The attacks were also a blow -- a deliberate one, it seemed -- to the new Palestinian government of Mr. Abbas, fanning Israeli doubts about his ability or willingness to fight terrorism. Further, Mr. Abbas had been hoping that President Bush would persuade Mr. Sharon during their meeting, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, to accept the new peace plan, known as the road map.</p>
        <p>The violence came before, during, and after a three-hour meeting on Saturday night between Mr. Sharon and Mr. Abbas, the highest-level talks between the sides since the current conflict began 31 months ago.</p>
        <p>The meeting left the leaders still at loggerheads, with Mr. Abbas insisting that Israel must adopt the peace plan before he could act against violence, and Mr. Sharon insisting that the Palestinians must stop terrorism before he could begin making the substantial concessions called for in the plan.</p>
        <p>Secretary of State Colin L. Powell visited Jerusalem a week ago to press both parties to begin putting the plan in action. But Mr. Sharon has argued that the plan slights Israel's security needs, and he had intended to lobby Mr. Bush for substantial changes.</p>
        <p>Diplomats involved in the peace effort said any prospect of pressure from Washington on Israel had been rendered less likely by the violence, particularly a suicide bombing aboard a Jerusalem bus this morning that killed seven people in addition to the bomber. Two Israelis -- a settler and his pregnant wife -- were killed in a separate suicide bombing on Saturday evening, in the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
        <p>Two other attacks resulted in no Israeli casualties. Minutes after the bus bombing this morning, another suicide bomber blew himself up on the outskirts of Jerusalem. And Israeli security forces shot dead two Palestinian gunmen overnight Saturday as they tried to infiltrate a settlement in the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''It's pretty grim,'' one Western diplomat said. ''We desperately need a signal from Washington on how they're going to proceed.''</p>
        <p>Another diplomat said, ''Anyone who tries to say anything positive right now is going to look stupid.''</p>
        <p>In a statement today, Secretary Powell condemned the bus bombing and called on the Palestinians ''to begin to take immediate and decisive action to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism.''</p>
        <p>Nabil Amr, Mr. Abbas's minister of information, issued a statement condemning the violence and saying that the Palestinian leadership ''is serious in taking measures and arrangements that aim to stop such attacks in order to create a proper atmosphere for resuming the political process.'' He called on Israel to accept the peace plan.</p>
        <p>With the plan still pending, Israeli soldiers have continued to operate in what by previous agreement is Palestinian-controlled territory. In Khan Yunis today, in the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot dead an 18-year-old man described by Palestinians as an unarmed civilian. The army said it fired on Palestinians who were planting a bomb.</p>
        <p>Israel also banished to Gaza for one year a West Bank Palestinian whom it accused of aiding a brother in terrorist attacks. The Israeli Army called it the first time in eight months that it had resorted to such action, which it referred to as ''limitation of residence.'' Israel describes the action as part of a policy to deter people from assisting terrorism.</p>
        <p>The new peace plan calls on Israel, in a first phase that includes a Palestinian crackdown on violence, to take ''no actions undermining trust, including deportations.'' The plan is the work of a diplomatic ''quartet'' consisting of the United States, the United Nations, the European Union and Russia.</p>
        <p>The plan calls for parallel progress on what are known as the security and political tracks, on the theory that past agreements failed because they stressed security, the central concern of Israel, over progress toward statehood, the central concern of Palestinians.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said their public would not support the plan.</p>
        <p>''As an Israeli, I don't want to hear the words 'road map' right now,'' one senior official said. ''What counts for me is the seven bodies, and the funerals we are going to witness tomorrow morning.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abbas, a longtime Palestinian negotiator who was appointed prime minister by Mr. Arafat under international pressure, has political problems of his own. Unlike Mr. Arafat, who retains control over much if not most of the governing Palestinian Authority, he has almost no popular backing. Palestinian officials say he can do little to act against violence without tangible gains from Israel, like an easing of checkpoints.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abbas has said he will disarm Hamas, but he has tried to accomplish that through negotiation rather than force, as Israel demands.</p>
        <p>Moshe Katsav, Israel's president, said, ''Our willingness to make concessions is a result of the Palestinian willingness to battle terrorism,'' adding that ''as the security situation and terror worsen, the willingness to make concessions diminishes.''</p>
