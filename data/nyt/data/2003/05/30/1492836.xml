        <p>Hostility along the border with Mexico between American ranchers, illegal immigrants traveling across their property and armed volunteer groups determined to keep them out found its way into a Texas court today.</p>
        <p>A lawsuit filed in State District Court in Jim Hogg County on behalf of six illegal immigrants contends that they were robbed, abused and threatened with murder on the exotic-game ranch of Joseph Sutton.</p>
        <p>Three men characterized as members of Ranch Rescue, an armed group dedicated to patrolling the American border and protecting private property, are listed as defendants. Ranch Rescue came under scrutiny last year after two Mexicans were found killed in the Arizona desert.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit is believed to be the first where illegal immigrants are challenging the legality of armed civilian patrols and their ability to detain people. It seeks the return of money the immigrants say was stolen from their shoes, along with other unspecified damages.</p>
        <p>Those damages could include Mr. Sutton's 5,000-acre ranch about 40 miles southeast of Laredo, said Joe Berra, a staff lawyer for the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the lawyers representing the immigrants.</p>
        <p>''What we are saying essentially is that you can't organize paramilitary groups in Texas,'' Mr. Berra said. ''Whatever our clients did does not justify the threats and thefts by this group that was protected by this rancher. What we are saying is that in this country you can't get away with that.''</p>
        <p>According to the court papers, Raúl Ruiz, José Rodríguez and Mario Rodríguez crossed the border and entered Mr. Sutton's ranch on March 7. They were detained at gunpoint and told to take off their shoes, which contained $3,000 in cash. A short time later, the papers said, Mr. Sutton arrived, loaded a magazine cartridge into his gun and told the men he could kill them without it ever being discovered.</p>
        <p>The men were eventually told to walk seven miles through cactus and rattlesnake country without their shoes, the papers said. They were later picked up by a sheriff's deputy and taken to a border patrol station, where Mr. Sutton had dropped off their shoes.</p>
        <p>Reached by telephone at his ranch, Mr. Sutton said today that he was unaware that a lawsuit had been filed. He laughed when told of the accusations and then broke into a monologue in perfect Spanish.</p>
        <p>''I know nothing about money being stolen or people being treated inhumanely,'' Mr. Sutton then said in English. ''I speak fluent Spanish because these people are my friends. I was raised with them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton's lawyer, Marvin L. Rader, said of the lawsuit: ''We'll have that sucker removed to federal court in a heartbeat. It puts it in a more fair forum. The issue here is a poor federal policy that has turned Joe's ranch into a way station.''</p>
        <p>Jack Foote, national spokesman and Texas coordinator of Ranch Rescue, whom the suit accuses of beating two Salvadoran immigrants, is not listed in local telephone directories, and it was unclear who is representing him.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit describes a similar incident on the ranch two weeks after the first. But a French journalist, Eric Boye, who was photographing the work of Ranch Rescue told The San Antonio Express-News that he had never seen Mr. Foote or Mr. Sutton beat or threaten anyone.</p>
        <p>The Web site of Ranch Rescue says its mission is to ''help private landowners with the repair of private property destroyed by those mass numbers of criminal trespassers.'' Members are said to be armed, to dress commonly in camouflage and to give their patrols military-type titles like Operation Falcon.</p>
        <p>Ranch Rescue is the most prominent of civilian patrol groups that operate across the nation. Late last year, when Ranch Rescue was investigated in connection with the killing of two immigrants, the local authorities in Arizona concluded that it was probably the work of drug gangs.</p>
