        <p>Metro Pictures  519 West 24th Street, Chelsea  Through June 21</p>
        <p>Tony Oursler has tried to escape his fate as the video doll maker, but his experiments with other forms, materials and technologies have yielded mostly disappointing results. Now he has returned to the deceptively simple device that made him famous and produced his best exhibition in years.</p>
        <p>Each piece consists of mobile human features projected in luridly over-ripe color on a bulbous white sculpture, a doughnut shape in one case and configurations of two or three ovoids in the others. Conforming to the convex surfaces, giant mismatched eyes, fat lips and big snaggly teeth (no noses) make up weird, comical and oddly endearing faces. Eyes blink and swivel and mouths smile, frown and pucker while emitting barely audible words or nonsense syllables through nearby speakers. Listen closely and you hear a female Cyclops complain: ''You treat me like garbage. I told you I love you, but I don't. Thanks for nothing.''</p>
        <p>A bug-eyed male with stubble around his red lips tries to fend off anxiety. ''You've been making new friends -- reward yourself with smiles,'' he intones, but then observes, ''Four hundred different germs reside here,'' and lapses momentarily into open-mouthed silence. Elsewhere you hear infantile babbling, kissing sounds and exclamations of erotic excitement. It's all entertaining, but it wouldn't be nearly as captivating if the emotions and the internal monologues didn't feel so poignantly real.</p>
