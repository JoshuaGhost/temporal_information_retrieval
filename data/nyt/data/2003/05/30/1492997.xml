        <p>ORLOFF--Neil, a leading environmental lawyer and noted documentary photographer, passed away on April 26, 2003, at the age of 59. His simultaneous careers as lawyer and artist captured the combination of powerful intellect and artistic imagination that defined a rich and productive life. He began his career in government, then moved to Cornell University where he was a professor and director of the Center for Environmental Research and finally switched to private practice in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City. While practicing law, he developed an independent career as an honored documentary photographer. His work led to positions as an artist in residence at the MacDowell Colony and the Yaddo Center, an unusual tribute for someone who was a full time artist only in spirit and talent. His photographic study of the homeless in Salt Lake City--''Under the Fifth Street Underpass'' -- was awarded a Utah Governor's Award in the Humanities in 2000, and was published by Art Access Gallery. Mr. Orloff is survived by his wife, Gudrun Mirin. &gt;&gt;AD#</p>
