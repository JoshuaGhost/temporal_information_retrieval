        <p>They took Fawzi first. The handsome youth with thick, curly hair and a straight black mustache vanished one afternoon in 1981. Muhammad was next, a year later. Then, in 1991, three more of the Menati brothers disappeared, their family says, bringing Saddam Hussein's grim harvest in the family to five.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Hussein's government now gone, the Menatis are looking for their lost ones, hoping they may find some of the sons alive or, if not, at least find their bones.</p>
        <p>''I was thinking that maybe they were in an underground prison somewhere,'' said Ghanad Thamer, 70, the mother of three of those missing. (The others are sons of her husband's second wife.) ''But they must be dead by now with no food, no water, no air.''</p>
        <p>It is, as yet, impossible to estimate the toll that Mr. Hussein's leadership took on his people, too early to say how many innocent lives were lost during his quarter century in power. Many of the records of who was killed and why were destroyed in the last hours before he lost power, and others have been scattered by the wind from his government's bombed and looted buildings.</p>
        <p>But there is a swell of rekindled sadness and rage among the families who lost children or parents or siblings here that suggests that the biggest story to emerge from this war may be an account of the brutality of Mr. Hussein's government, more than of unconventional weapons or oil.</p>
        <p>In Baghdad, people here say, Mr. Hussein preyed upon Saddam City, the Shiite slum that bore his name. Residents say nearly every family in the district was touched by the terror and, now, its garbage-strewn streets are engulfed with the overlapping efforts of families to piece together paper trails that may lead to those who were lost and rites for those whose remains have been found.</p>
        <p>The Menati family was encountered at a memorial service for a young man who disappeared in March 2000 and whose bones had been discovered in a prison grave the previous day. Another huge funeral procession was passing by -- for a young man whose death certificate had been recovered but whose grave could not be found. Later, at the Menati home, a neighbor stopped by to discuss his family's search for their missing sons, two of whose remains they hoped to retrieve the next day.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Hussein became president in 1979, he set quickly about eliminating any potential opponents of his rule. He focused first on the Dawa Party, a decades-old Islamist movement that had spread through the country's poor, disgruntled Shiite population. He outlawed the party and ordered hundreds of its members executed, including the group's charismatic leader, Muhammad Bakr al-Sadr. Thousands of Mr. Sadr's supporters were rounded up from Iraq's Shiite neighborhoods. Fawzi al-Menati, 20, was one.</p>
        <p>''We didn't have any news of him until 1983, when we were told we could go visit him in Al Khassah,'' said Farid al-Menati, one of Fawzi's older brothers, sitting cross-legged in the small dingy room that serves as the family's parlor.</p>
        <p>Al Khassah, which means ''the special one,'' was the political prison inside the vast, walled Abu Ghraib prison compound west of Baghdad. They found their missing brother there. He was thin and said he had been beaten, but he was alive.</p>
        <p>By that time, though, Muhammad had disappeared, also at age 20. He was hanged on Oct. 8, 1983, but the family only discovered that in 1989, when someone from the local state security office came to the house and told his mother she could pick up his death certificate. Muhammad, the family learned, had been executed after having been accused of being a member of the Communist Party.</p>
        <p>After that, the remaining brothers were watched and harassed by Mr. Hussein's security agents, family members said.</p>
        <p>Farid, one of the older brothers, flipped through a 50-page file, scorched at the edges, that a boy had found in a burning local security office more than a mile away after it had been set on fire and abandoned three weeks ago in the face of the American advance. The boy had turned it over to the Menati family. Its pages, held together between yellow construction paper and tied with a black shoelace, document 20 years of surveillance.</p>
        <p>From interrogation reports to lists of relatives twice removed, the documents tell a disturbing tale of official suspicion about a family whose greatest sin, it seems, was having too many boys. Muhammad's execution followed the family like a curse, turning the Menati daughters into spinsters because under Mr. Hussein's rule all marriages had to be approved by Iraq's intelligence service, the family said. The Menati men struggled to find jobs.</p>
        <p>Fawzi al-Menati was released in 1986 in one of Mr. Hussein's periodic presidential amnesties, but he vanished again three months later and has not been heard from since. Many of the documents bear tantalizing references to an escape by Fawzi to Iraq's southern marshlands or even Iran.</p>
        <p>If any of the family's men had not been quiet opponents to the government, then the treatment they suffered after Fawzi disappeared the second time turned them soundly against Mr. Hussein. The family's home was regularly raided, and during one raid a hand-tinted studio portrait of Fawzi was snatched from the wall. It was found in the scorched file.</p>
        <p>A glimmer of hope that Mr. Hussein's days were ending came with the 1991 gulf war. At America's urging, the Shiites, in the majority in Iraq but living under the political domination of the Sunni minority, revolted and took control of much of the central and southern parts of the country. The rebellion reached Saddam City, and the Menati men responded with glee.</p>
        <p>''We thought the regime had lost control, and we were tearing down Saddam's portraits,'' recalled Khudair, another brother, with a thick, black beard.</p>
        <p>But the uprising failed, and Mr. Hussein's security forces waded into the Shiite areas, culling sons and fathers from almost every family, the people here say. They arrived at the Menati door in the afternoon, grabbing the four brothers who were home. The rest fled. A fifth, Walid, came home from the army a few days later to check on his family and he, too, was seized. In all, there were 12 brothers and 10 sisters between the mothers.</p>
        <p>The security forces quickly released the youngest brother, who was just 17 at the time. Walid was sent home nine months later with two broken arms, a broken leg and a cracked skull. The others, Ali, Abbas and Jalal, are still missing.</p>
        <p>A handwritten document from that period in the file lists all of the Menati family members, their dates of birth and suspected political affiliations. At the bottom of the page in a separate hand is recorded their official designation: family of haters.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Hussein's government fell at last, three weeks ago, the family rushed to the main security office in Saddam City to search for records of their missing men. They went, too, to the main State Security compound in Baghdad, where they found a few clues: two index cards, giving the case numbers for Ali and Walid, and part of a report on the sweep that followed the 1991 uprising. The report mentioned Walid and said he had two brothers who had been executed, Muhammad and Fawzi.</p>
        <p>''I hope my sons are still alive,'' said Fawzi's mother, Radaah Mahdi, wrapped in the black cotton garment that Shiite women wear. ''But after 20 days they haven't appeared, and I'm beginning to think they aren't alive anymore.''</p>
        <p>Armed with the file and other bits of information, family members have gone looking for the sons, traveling with other families to the cemetery at Kharq to ask the caretaker to search his records. The caretaker found the grave of a friend, but not of any Menati boys.</p>
        <p>''All I wanted in life is to know my sons are alive,'' Ms. Mahdi said. ''The pain never eases, it burns in my heart every day.''</p>
