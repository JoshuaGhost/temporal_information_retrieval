        <p>Le caviar nouveau est arrivé!</p>
        <p>It is harvest time in this fertile plain 80 miles northwest of Bordeaux, and Alan Jones is furiously readying his spring crop for market. The objects of his attention on a drizzly Saturday morning are not the grapes that produce Bordeaux's 800 million bottles of wine a year, but fish -- thousands of five-foot-long female sturgeon.</p>
        <p>He examines the distended, caviar-filled bellies and caresses the shiny, smooth flesh of the toothless, prehistoric-looking creatures as they struggle to escape. He checks the long raceways built to move the slightly brackish water in the man-made ponds in which the fish grow.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, Mr. Jones, a 57-year-old British marine biologist who once farmed turbot and sea bream, teamed up with a French businessman to raise Siberian sturgeon in a region whose indigenous population in the Gironde and Aquitaine is nearly extinct. Acipenser baerii, as the species is known, is the one sturgeon authorized by the French government for farming.</p>
        <p>Finally, he is seeing results. He has eliminated the blue-green algae that can give freshwater fish a muddy taste. He is harvesting his sixth crop this spring, and will produce five tons in 2003, about two-thirds of the entire French crop. ''Others are going to catch up, because they've got big ambitions and big money,'' Mr. Jones said. ''But right now, we're leading the way.''</p>
        <p>French caviar accounts for at most 10 percent of the caviar market in France. But it has suddenly become chic and is even sold abroad.</p>
        <p>Caviar d'Aquitaine, as French caviar is called, is sold at the finest caviar emporiums in Paris, including Petrossian, near the Place des Invalides, and Caviar Kaspia, on the Place de la Madeline.</p>
        <p>Maison Prunier, the landmark Art Deco oyster-and-caviar brasserie that has been serving caviar for almost a century, tries to serve nothing but the French product. Its caviar is raised on a farm in the Aquitaine region owned by Pierre Bergé, the former business partner of fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent and since 2000 the owner of the brasserie. (Iranian caviar, considered much better than Russian for years, is kept in the refrigerators for the die-hards who will eat nothing but.)</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Jones, who sells stock to both Petrossian and Kaspia, he has plans to team up with a local winery to do caviar-and-wine tastings.</p>
        <p>''It's not that people who buy Iranian caviar are suddenly going to substitute French,'' said Armen Petrossian, probably the best-known caviar merchant in the world, who sells what he buys from Mr. Jones under the Petrossian label. ''It's that French people who have never tried caviar in their lives are trying it, attracted by a lower price and the fact that they're buying French. So we are creating a new market, and we're giving people a choice.''</p>
        <p>But French caviar has contributed to a war in the narrow, elite Parisian world of fish eggs.</p>
        <p>The global caviar market is in turmoil. Criminal mafias are known to be involved in the Russian caviar trade these days, and the Russian caviar is unreliable in quality. The price of Iranian caviar has soared. Poaching, smuggling and overfishing have reduced the sturgeon stocks in the Caspian Sea, where sturgeon that produce caviar are found naturally, by more than 90 percent since the late 1970's.</p>
        <p>The supply problem coincides with a demand that has also become unpredictable -- the result of a post-Sept. 11 malaise in the world of luxury goods, a global recession, the economic and psychological effect of the war in Iraq and the anti-French feeling in the United States.</p>
        <p>Maison Prunier had not one customer at the peak of lunch hour one recent weekday; Caviar Kaspia had a cancellation of the birthday celebration of a treasured American client and his 40 guests. He just did not think it right to celebrate in France this year, a Kaspia official said.</p>
        <p>In this tough, gotta-have-a-gimmick market, Caviar Kaspia introduced a product in April that it calls ''spring caviar,'' which goes from belly to table in days.</p>
        <p>Packaged in tins with a smiling blue sturgeon swimming in a red poppy, it is advertised as ''bracing and joyous,'' with a ''clear and subtle'' taste that ''evokes nature's renewal.''</p>
        <p>The eggs are smaller than Iranian beluga or sevruga, but then it sells for much less than Kaspia's trademark Iranian caviar. A 30-gram tin of the French ''spring'' variety -- a little more than an ounce -- costs about $43, compared with $63 for the least expensive Iranian sevruga and about $140 for top-of-the-line beluga.</p>
        <p>''Caviar was regarded as a little old-fashioned and we wanted to lure a new clientele,'' said Ramon Mac-Crohon, the marketing director for Kaspia. ''So we're saying, 'Eat spring caviar at a picnic with a glass of white wine.' We're trying to do with caviar what you in America did with cigars.''</p>
        <p>Maison Prunier has the longest experience with French caviar and says it has the best product. The brasserie has hung some of its menus from the early 20th century that advertise caviar omelets and ''fresh caviar'' sandwiches. It sells its French line of caviar in American shops like Balducci's in New York.</p>
        <p>To capture more of the market, Prunier is opening a retail caviar boutique and restaurant next door to Caviar Kaspia in November. What complicates the picture even further is that François Barber, the director general of Prunier, worked for Caviar Kaspia for three years.</p>
        <p>''This is, of course, treason, treason!'' said Mr. Petrossian, who has worked with and competed against Kaspia for decades and resents the intrusion of what he calls a newcomer. He added, ''One can never open a shop next to a competitor.''</p>
        <p>As for spring caviar, he does not believe in it. ''Serving caviar when it is too raw doesn't make sense,'' he said. ''You have to have maturation of caviar in the tin and that takes time. You won't have any taste without it. It's like aging beef.''</p>
        <p>Caviar needs at least three months of ''aging,'' he said, so that the taste can get ''rounder and better.'' Still, he said he had to do something for clients who asked him for ''spring caviar.'' So he has stuck tiny labels on his fresh stock of French caviar that read, ''Selected for spring.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Petrossian sells mostly Iranian and Russian caviar in his shop in Paris and those in the United States, and a much smaller quantity of French and American. Although fish farmers in other countries, including China, Japan, Spain, Canada, Israel, Paraguay and Chile, are beginning to produce caviar, their product is just not good enough, he said. By contrast, he added, American caviar is ''not bad.''</p>
        <p>Asked to reveal his favorite caviar, he demurs. ''It depends on the time of day,'' he said. ''You don't have the same needs all the time.</p>
        <p>''In the morning you want something strong to give you more energy,'' he continued. ''At lunch maybe a little less strong, more rounded. But in the evening you want the taste to be completely smooth, you want only the rolling of the eggs, so you take the beluga. The only rule is to take your pleasure where you can and to do it well.''</p>
