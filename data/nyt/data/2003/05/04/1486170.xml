        <p>Allan Sack, a pioneering speed-reading educator who taught fast ways to absorb information from the printed page well before Evelyn Wood became a franchised household name, died last Sunday in San Diego. He was 88 and had lived in San Diego since 1990.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sack worked in adult reading education for more than 50 years, mostly in New York but later at the University of California at San Diego. He taught what he called his structural-analytical method, which was based on analyzing the meaning and organization of a text to enhance comprehension and performance in reading, writing and note-taking.</p>

        <p>Allan Sack, a pioneering speed-reading educator who taught fast ways to absorb information from the printed page well before Evelyn Wood became a franchised household name, died last Sunday in San Diego. He was 88 and had lived in San Diego since 1990.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sack worked in adult reading education for more than 50 years, mostly in New York but later at the University of California at San Diego. He taught what he called his structural-analytical method, which was based on analyzing the meaning and organization of a text to enhance comprehension and performance in reading, writing and note-taking.</p>
        <p>His latest book, meant for teachers, was ''Raising Reading Scores,'' issued last year. The publisher, Optima Books of Berkeley, Calif., has scheduled two more of his books for this year -- ''Shortcut to Word Power: Essential Greek and Latin Roots and Prefixes'' and ''How to Build an Educated Vocabulary: An Enjoyable, Engrossing, Informative Guide to Increasing Word Knowledge.''</p>
        <p>A native of New York, Mr. Sack graduated from Brooklyn College in 1932 and received a master's degree in educational psychology from Teachers College at Columbia. In 1951, he and Jack Yourman founded the Speed Reading Institute in New York. In affiliation with various colleges, Mr. Sack's institute offered workshops in his structural approach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sack is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Florence Gold; a daughter, Anne S. Heybey of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, David B., of Kibbutz Dan, Israel; a brother, Irwin S. of Woodsburgh, N.Y.; three grandchildren; and two great-grandsons.</p>
