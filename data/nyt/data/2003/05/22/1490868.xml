        <p>Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz says his recent trip to the Balkans and Eastern Europe holds lessons on postwar stabilization and the transition from dictatorship to democracy that are helping shape his views on how best to rebuild Iraq.</p>
        <p>The experience in Bosnia shows the danger of rushing to hold elections in postwar Iraq simply as a show of democracy taking root, he said in an interview after his return this week. The threat is that dangerously divisive leaders may be the first to take power, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz also said that the peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo underline the importance of forces ''so big and strong that nobody would dare pick a fight with us.''</p>
        <p>''I think there may be something to the notion that the more you have at the beginning, the faster you can draw down,'' said Mr. Wolfowitz, who was among those who criticized Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, who suggested it could take ''something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers'' to stabilize Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz said the Pentagon still had no final total for the troops needed to stabilize Iraq and indicated it would not reach General Shinseki's estimate.</p>
        <p>But, he said, remnants of the Iraqi government -- and other anti-American forces in the region who may hope the United States does not have the stomach for rebuilding Iraq -- should note the continued, if reduced, American military presence in the Balkans. It has remained almost eight years after the Dayton Accords ended bloodshed among Bosnia's warring Muslims, Croats and Serbs.</p>
        <p>''Sept. 11 has clearly changed the stakes for the United States in dealing with security issues in those areas that could be sanctuaries for terrorists,'' he said. Bosnia, he added, would not be ''just any failed state around the world, but one with a Muslim population in the heart of Europe.''</p>
        <p>Even today, Mr. Wolfowitz warned, Bosnia remains a channel for terrorist networks to move money and people.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz, who is to testify on Thursday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Iraqi stabilization and reconstruction, said he was especially moved by a visit to Srebrenica, where conversations still carry a subtext of loss.</p>
        <p>His weekend visit to Srebrenica, where Bosnian Serb forces killed more than 7,000 Muslims in 1995, coincided with the exhumation of bodies from a mass grave at an abandoned Iraqi military camp near Habbinaya. The remains in Iraq are believed to be Kuwaitis missing since the Persian Gulf war in 1991.</p>
        <p>Srebrenica survivors stressed ''the importance of dealing with certain things early on,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said. ''In Bosnia, they are still living with the failure to have done so: getting rid of bad actors and instituting the rule of law.''</p>
        <p>Although elections are a benchmark for democratic public life, Mr. Wolfowitz echoed concerns expressed by international officials on the ground in Bosnia. ''By holding elections so early, it became impossible to remove some bad actors, because they now had electoral authority,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Iraq, Mr. Wolfowitz said, ''I don't think we should give up the authority to remove people who are guilty of war crimes, although preferably the Iraqis will remove people who are guilty of war crimes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolfowitz visited the Turkish battle group assigned peacekeeping duties at Zenica, Bosnia. It was an especially symbolic stop.</p>
        <p>He said, ''I hope some people back in Ankara noticed,'' because Turkey has an important role to play in rebuilding Iraq.</p>
        <p>Turkey's new government blocked American requests to use its territory to open a northern front in Iraq, a refusal the United States said complicated the war effort.</p>
        <p>After visits to Kosovo and Macedonia, Mr. Wolfowitz traveled to Romania, where he discussed how to weed out the remnants of ''the secret services that were so embedded in the society'' during the Communist era.</p>
        <p>''Those elements of repression from the old regime are clearly still around and actively making trouble in Iraq,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But there was an enormous difference in the way communist Eastern Europe threw off its dictators and the toppling of the Saddam Hussein government in Iraq: communism collapsed with demonstrations on the streets, which invested the population with a pride in embracing democracy, while an American-led group of nations invaded Iraq to remove Mr. Hussein.</p>
        <p>''Iraq has this advantage, which is that we are there, with the coalition, and with an enormous commitment to help get it right,'' Mr. Wolfowitz said.</p>
