        <p>John Davis sauntered casually through the crowded set of ''Garfield'' one recent afternoon, stepping over cables and around false walls, looking much more like a member of the movie's production crew than like the unassuming son of a billionaire and this film's unlikely producer.</p>
        <p>Wearing blue jeans, sneakers and a Citgo Racing cap, he leaned down for a closer look at a tiny stuffed version of Garfield, the comic-strip cat, which is a computer-generated character in the film. ''If you are an obsessive person -- and to do this job you kind of have to be -- then there's always something you can be doing,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>The son of Marvin Davis, the oil and real estate tycoon who once owned 20th Century Fox and is now bidding for Vivendi Universal's entertainment empire, John Davis might have been expected to buy his way into the Hollywood limelight, as others have before him.</p>
        <p>Instead he has quietly capitalized on his connections to become one of the most prolific yet least heralded producers in the movie industry, responsible these days for about as many big-studio movies as Jerry Bruckheimer, Brian Grazer, Scott Rudin and other, better-known A-list producers. Unlikely as it seems for a scion of the wealthy, Mr. Davis, 48, may be a leading example of a new breed of mainstream producers: business school graduates who are less interested in fearsome reputations than in bottom-line results and more in tune with the corporate culture that has come to dominate the movie business.</p>
        <p>''The way the movie industry has changed has been very good for me, because it matches my personality,'' said Mr. Davis, who is married and has three young children. ''It's a business, and it's being run like a business now. The day of the enfant terrible is over, the kind of producers who had 40 assistants, were constantly having big, expensive meals all over town and coming to the set with lavish displays of opulence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis is a proud bottom-liner. He insists that he makes only the kind of movies that he wants to see, and takes pride in developing his own projects in-house. Even though his company, Davis Entertainment, has a division for making smaller films (less than $5 million), few would mistake Mr. Davis for an art-house producer. His biggest hits, like ''The Firm'' (1993), ''Dr. Dolittle'' (1998) and ''Behind Enemy Lines'' (2001), were solidly mainstream. Almost all his films are geared toward mass tastes, with little apparent interest in seducing critics or winning Oscars.</p>
        <p>His newest movie, ''Daddy Day Care,'' which opened Friday, is typical: a family comedy with its share of potty jokes. The film, about an out-of-work marketing executive who opens a day care center, is Mr. Davis's third with Eddie Murphy. The reviews have been dreadful. In The New York Times Elvis Mitchell described it as ''a comedy that would have to work harder even to justify the appellation uninspired.'' Still, it made $27.6 million at the box office in its opening weekend.</p>
        <p>Since 1985 Mr. Davis and his company have finished 58 films, and he intends to have seven more in production before the year is out. Outside of a handful of small, independent efforts, his films are all studio financed; he does not invest any of his own fortune in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis was reared in Denver, where his father's oil and natural gas empire was built. Among the family's real estate holdings was a neighborhood multiplex, where Mr. Davis sold popcorn and, he said, developed a love for movies. Still, he had no intention of going into the movie business when he studied at Bowdoin, Amherst and the Harvard Business School.</p>
        <p>An even bigger interest at the time, he said, was sports, so his first job in New York was in cable sports television. Even in the early 1980's, when he went to work for Fox, which his father had acquired by then, it was in the telecommunications division.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I came out to California, my heart went from cable television to movie producing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When Marvin Davis sold his stake in Fox to Rupert Murdoch in 1985, John left to set up Davis Entertainment, but returned to Fox eight years later with a deal giving the studio first rights to any of his films. What he has found there, he said, is business-oriented, corporate thinking that fits his own approach to movie making: bragging about cost savings rather than yacht size.</p>
        <p>''On this movie we didn't have enough money in the budget for a famous production designer,'' he said during a shooting break on ''Garfield.'' ''So we went out and found a guy, Alec Hammond, who had never been a production designer on a major studio movie before. He looked like he was ready to step up, so we gave him his first chance. He's doing a great job, and it didn't cost us as much.''</p>
        <p>Steve Carr, the director of ''Daddy Day Care,'' had a similar experience. ''I had done a small urban comedy called 'Next Friday' that did really well, and John called me up,'' said Mr. Carr, who was asked in 2001 to direct ''Dr. Dolittle 2,'' a much bigger film.</p>
        <p>''There was really no reason for me to step up that fast to a major Eddie Murphy movie,'' he said. ''But John really believed in me, I guess. And he's smart of course. He knew he'd get me for next to nothing.''</p>
        <p>''Dr. Dolittle 2'' made $175 million worldwide and landed Mr. Carr his ''Daddy Day Care'' job.</p>
        <p>''Garfield'' -- based on the comic strip created by Jim Davis (no relation) about a gluttonous and famously sarcastic cat -- is only one of three movies John Davis is shooting at the moment. Ben Affleck is starring in ''Paycheck,'' a thriller from the director John Woo, and Will Smith is making ''I, Robot,'' a big-budget adaptation of Isaac Asimov's sci-fi classic of the same title.</p>
        <p>Later this month Mr. Davis will begin work on ''First Daughter,'' a comedy with Katie Holmes playing the president's child. And he has two more set to go in September, ''Flight of the Phoenix,'' a remake of the 1965 desert survival adventure, and ''Predator vs. Alien,'' a sci-fi thriller that pits the creature from Mr. Davis's ''Predator'' movies against the monster from the ''Alien'' films.</p>
        <p>Before the year is out, he said, he intends to start shooting ''Earthbound,'' a comedy-drama about a woman dying of cancer, starring Jennifer Lopez.</p>
        <p>''Being Marvin's son could have really helped him in his career and it could have really hurt him,'' said Tom Sherak, a partner at Revolution Studios and a longtime friend. ''But he's been very careful about walking that line right down the middle. I mean, he never invokes his father, but at the same time you're always aware that he's Marvin Davis's son.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis just shrugs when asked about this. ''I appreciate the luck that I've had, and I hope that it holds up,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis says the key to his success is that his temperament and his taste have matched the times.</p>
        <p>''Producing movies used to be more about the lifestyle of show business,'' he said. ''Showboats, ostentatious living, people who yelled. I don't yell. I don't fight. I have a very businesslike personality, and maybe that fits with what movies have become these days.''</p>
