        <p>After tonight's 4-0 victory, the Anaheim Mighty Ducks lead the Western Conference finals by 3-0 over the Minnesota Wild. But some questions remain.</p>
        <p>Can the Wild score a goal in this series against Jean-Sébastien Giguère? Perhaps.</p>
        <p>Can the Wild win a game? It's possible.</p>
        <p>Can the Wild win four consecutive games and reach the Stanley Cup finals? Not likely.</p>
        <p>Only two teams have overcome such a deficit to win a series. The last team to do it was the 1975 Islanders, who beat Pittsburgh. The other was the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, who beat Detroit. The Wild hardly seems in that category. It looks tired and beaten. While the Ducks advanced to this round by sweeping Detroit in four games and ousting Dallas in six, the Wild needed seven games against Colorado and Vancouver after falling behind, 3-1, in each series.</p>
        <p>After winning Game 1 in double overtime, 1-0, and Game 2, 2-0, Anaheim battered both Minnesota goalies tonight. Paul Kariya of the Ducks scored two goals; the second was one of those highlight moments that will be shown on scoreboards for some time to entertain fans.</p>
        <p>It was one of the few compelling things so far in what has been a tepid series between sixth-seeded Minnesota and seventh-seeded Anaheim. The winner of this round plays either the Devils or the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>Also scoring for Anaheim were Steve Rucchin and Stanislav Chistov. Giguère stopped 35 shots. His shutout streak against Minnesota reached 208 minutes 6 seconds. His overall shutout streak, including the final game of the previous series, is 213:17.</p>
        <p>Giguère became the sixth goalie in league history to have three consecutive shutouts in the Stanley Cup playoffs. He is the first goalie to record three consecutive shutouts in a conference finals.</p>
        <p>The N.H.L. record is 248:32 by Normie Smith of Detroit in 1936.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, it's a little bit surreal,'' Giguère said. ''They are a good team. They try to find a way to score, but we're not going to give it to them.''</p>
        <p>Early in the third period, Giguère frustrated the Wild on consecutive shots. The first was a backhander by Jim Dowd; the second was when Wes Walz put a rebound right back at him; the third was a short shot by Cliff Ronning after a face-off; the fourth was a shot by Sergei Zholtok that led to an angry scrum when Matt Johnson of the Wild bumped Giguère as he covered the puck.</p>
        <p>Jacques Lemaire, coach of the Wild, reflected grimly that his team was better at the start of the game. ''We were really on the jump at the start,'' he said. ''The more they score, the more you slow down. They deserve it. I have to admit it, they played very well.''</p>
        <p>The Ducks took a 1-0 lead on a goal by Rucchin, who knocked a rebound past goalie Dwayne Roloson at 4:59</p>
        <p>The Ducks made the score 2-0 at 8:20 of the second period on the first goal of the series by Kariya, who took a pass from Adam Oates from behind the net. It increased to 3-0 at 12:16 on a goal by Stanislav Chistov, who backhanded a rebound past the sprawling Roloson.</p>
        <p>At that point, Manny Fernandez replaced Roloson, but that did not stop the barrage. Anaheim made it 4-0 on Kariya's second goal, and this was the highlight moment. After Fernandez blocked a shot by Petr Sykora, the puck floated above the ice.</p>
        <p>Kariya darted to the crease (to the goalie's glove side), and watched it come down. From what looked like an awkward stance, he waited until the puck was below the level of the crossbar, four feet above the ice. That made his shot legal when he swatted it into the net backhanded at 13:51 for his second of the night.</p>
        <p>Minnesota's frustration was on display early in the first period when Marian Gaborik scooped up a loose puck after it was misplayed by Keith Carney and Ruslan Salei of the Ducks at the Minnesota blue line.</p>
        <p>Gaborik raced into the clear and skated in on Giguère. With the puck on his forehand, he fired a low wrist shot that Giguère turned away. ''He kind of surprised me,'' Giguère said. ''I just went down and got a good pad on it.''</p>
