        <p>Terror strikes again, and we promise to redouble our efforts, even as terrorists are reconstituting their organizations, and so it goes ad infinitum (front page, May 13).

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Terror strikes again, and we promise to redouble our efforts, even as terrorists are reconstituting their organizations, and so it goes ad infinitum (front page, May 13). We will never be able to track down every terrorist and prevent every terrorist act, and we must seriously question whether our actions promote rather than prevent more terrorism.</p>
        <p>We may ultimately defeat terrorism only when the fundamentalist, violent ideology of terrorism is marginalized in the very societies and cultures in which terrorists can thrive. And we will achieve this marginalization only when those societies and cultures believe that we are truly faithful to our professed ideals of equality, liberty and justice, both at home and abroad. Indeed, it is not our freedom that they hate, but the fact that we are so selective about handing it out.</p>
