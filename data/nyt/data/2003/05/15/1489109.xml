        <p>''I'M pretty much on instant messaging from when I get home until I go to bed,'' said Laura Gittleson, a 15-year-old in Colts Neck, N.J. She is not alone.</p>

        <p>''I'M pretty much on instant messaging from when I get home until I go to bed,'' said Laura Gittleson, a 15-year-old in Colts Neck, N.J. She is not alone.</p>
        <p>America Online, the service Ms. Gittleson uses, says 195 million people use its instant messaging service, their keystrokes generating more than 1.6 billion messages a day. For those users, instant messaging -- or IM -- has become an intrinsic part of their social fabric.</p>
        <p>''On the phone, you can only talk to one person at a time,'' she said. ''Online, you can talk to a dozen people at once.''</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone is as enamored with the craze. ''It's a big distraction when she's on the computer and supposed to be doing her homework,'' said Norman Gittleson, her father.</p>
        <p>Soon, Mr. Gittleson may have a lot more to complain about.</p>
        <p>Initially, instant messaging on a PC was a throwback to the days of mainframe computers when workers at terminals could communicate using short text messages. In the Internet world, these became live text chat sessions online.</p>
        <p>Today, it has grown beyond plain text to include the exchange of pictures and video, like the matchbox-size images that users of Yahoo Messenger can exchange using Webcams. Yahoo and other services are also expanding the ability to use instant-messaging software to place phone calls over the Internet and exchange text messages with cellphone users, all in an attempt to extend the medium's allure beyond the PC.</p>
        <p>Consequently, competing services from AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo continue to add features to one-up their rivals even though all the services are free.</p>
        <p>''That's the big challenge,'' said Stephen Kim, an analyst at comScore Media Metrix. ''You've got huge user bases but no revenue model.''</p>
        <p>Getting subscription fees from users who are accustomed to sending instant messages free does not seem viable, Mr. Kim said. Meanwhile, the instant-messaging providers continue to invest in computer servers and software to handle the billions of daily chats. Mr. Kim said the idea of having millions of consumers dependent on these services was irresistible.</p>
        <p>''Instant messaging may become a gateway to create business elsewhere,'' Mr. Kim said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the major messaging services are trying to use the popularity of their systems with consumers to get corporations to pay for software that can manage and log all those instant messages. Without such server software, employees' instant messages usually go unchecked over private corporate networks.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, for example, recently announced plans for its Windows Real-Time Communications Server, but the company has yet to disclose a price for the new business software.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Microsoft seems intent on appealing to legions of new IM users. NetGen, the name for a youth-oriented effort by the company, is testing a version of instant messaging that allows groups of up to 10 people not only to take part in text chats but also to exchange pictures, animations and music.</p>
        <p>A free trial version of the software, called Threedegrees, is available at www.threedegrees.com.</p>
        <p>A circle of Threedegrees members can communicate with one another by dragging and dropping items onto their group's icon. You can click on a picture of your cat, for example, drag it over to the Threedegrees icon, and the pet's visage pops up on the screens of all the members. You can do the same with animations, messages and music.</p>
        <p>''Having these social applications around IM is what's very different,'' said Tammy Savage, the NetGen group manager, whose team is preparing Threedegrees for an official release this fall. ''Young people use IM for socializing, and socializing can be a lot more than just text.''</p>
        <p>One Threedegrees feature, for example, lets members play disc jockey. Any member can start a song, which plays off that person's hard drive and over the other members' speakers. While the music is playing, the others can add their own favorite songs to the lineup. (To placate the recording industry, Microsoft has made sure that songs are not copied to other members' systems but will play only from the original owner's computer.)</p>
        <p>Early Threedegrees users are also adapting this form of IM to their own social devices. ''Someone even created a drinking game,'' Ms. Savage said. ''Someone over 21, that is.''</p>
        <p>But all this assumes sufficient equipment and technical prowess. To receive instant messages on a cellphone, for example, you must have a new phone with short messaging service and remember to log in when you turn your phone on. To share pictures and music over IM, you need a high-speed Internet connection; otherwise, the multimedia elements are irritatingly tardy.</p>
        <p>Moreover, those intrepid enough to try the prerelease version of Threedegrees, for example, will discover that it works only with Microsoft's latest operating system, Windows XP, and requires several additional software elements.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, most of the IM services continue to work on adding features.</p>
        <p>''You'll see instant messaging integrated in even more places,'' said Lisa Pollock Mann, senior director of messaging products at Yahoo. ''It will become more of a communications hub, over and above text messaging.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Mann expects to see features like multiplayer games wrapped into future instant messaging services. In fact, Microsoft recently announced that the next version of its Messenger would feature live games.</p>
        <p>Before it can be transformed into an all-purpose social secretary, communications tool and entertainment medium, instant messaging will have to overcome another hurdle: compatibility.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the three major IM systems controlled by AOL, Microsoft and Yahoo cannot exchange traffic directly for various technical, commercial and security reasons. The Internet Engineering Task Force is working on specifications that would allow IM services to pass messages from one to another, but there is no assurance that the services will embrace the result.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, for inveterate instant messaging users who have contacts on competing systems, there are ways around the barriers.</p>
        <p>Several free programs, like Odigo (www.odigo.org) and Omni (www.emphatech.com), let computer users talk to people on rival systems simultaneously. One of the most popular of these so-called aggregators is Cerulean Studios' Trillian, which offers free software online as well as a fuller-featured version for $25 (www.trillian.cc/trillian/index.html). It says it has 2.5 to 3 million users.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the lack of compatibility has not discouraged people like Ms. Gittleson from making instant messaging a part of their daily routine. She has a buddy list of about 200 people and types messages with such alacrity that she sometimes inadvertently triggers AOL's spam-fighting controls, which prevent users from sending too many messages within a set time limit.</p>
        <p>Others are not concerned at all about interoperability or new features like music sharing. They have just one question. ''Is there something out there that can block it?'' Mr. Gittleson asks. ''I'd really love to block it.''</p>
