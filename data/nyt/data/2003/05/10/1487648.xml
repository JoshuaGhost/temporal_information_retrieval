        <p>Stanley Cup contenders Minnesota Wild, New Jersey Devils, Ottawa Senators and Anaheim Mighty Ducks are not necessarily teams expected to reach this level of postseason; photos (M)</p>

        <p>It has been a stunning spring of emergence in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Three of the four remaining teams did not even exist until the 1990's and have never before reached this level in the postseason. One of them, Ottawa, is in bankruptcy protection and on the verge of new ownership. Another, Anaheim, is for sale.</p>
        <p>But none have written a more improbable script than the Minnesota Wild, which defeated the Vancouver Canucks, 4-2, in Game 7 on Thursday night to move into the Western Conference finals. Yet the Wild has the lowest payroll among the league's 30 teams, at $20.7 million, according to the N.H.L. Players' Association.</p>

        <p>It has been a stunning spring of emergence in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Three of the four remaining teams did not even exist until the 1990's and have never before reached this level in the postseason. One of them, Ottawa, is in bankruptcy protection and on the verge of new ownership. Another, Anaheim, is for sale.</p>
        <p>But none have written a more improbable script than the Minnesota Wild, which defeated the Vancouver Canucks, 4-2, in Game 7 on Thursday night to move into the Western Conference finals. Yet the Wild has the lowest payroll among the league's 30 teams, at $20.7 million, according to the N.H.L. Players' Association.</p>
        <p>The Wild, which began play in 2000, will face the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a team that began play in 1993. That series starts this afternoon in St. Paul. In the Eastern Conference finals, the Ottawa Senators, who began play in 1992, will play host to the Devils tonight.</p>
        <p>Compared with the other three teams, the Devils seem relatively wealthy and well established. They have played in New Jersey since 1982; they spent the previous six seasons in Denver as the Colorado Rockies and the two before that in Kansas City as the Scouts.</p>
        <p>The Devils have won the Stanley Cup twice and may be considered the favorites this spring, even though the Senators are seeded above them. Of the four finalists, the Devils have the highest payroll, at $55.4 million, eighth in the N.H.L., according to figures from the players' association. The Ducks are 10th at $45.5 million and the Senators are 19th at $34.8 million.</p>
        <p>But what is the hockey world to make of the Wild, which eliminated the Colorado Avalanche and the Canucks after trailing in each series by three games to one. No team in N.H.L. history had done that. And Minnesota did it with only one player, Cliff Ronning, making more than the average N.H.L. salary. Ronning earns $1.85 million. The average in 2001-2, the last season computed, was $1.64 million.</p>
        <p>The puck-stopping burden for the Wild has been shared by Dwayne Roloson, who is 5-4 in the playoffs, and Manny Fernandez (3-2). Teams rarely succeed in the playoffs with such a formula, but the Wild is not a franchise bound to precedent. Although this is Minnesota's first appearance in the postseason, the Wild players have shown more poise than their opponents.</p>
        <p>That was apparent in Game 7 in Vancouver, when the Canucks trailed by 3-2 late in the third period after squandering a 2-0 lead. Vancouver forward Todd Bertuzzi took an interference penalty for knocking defenseman Andrei Zyuzin into Roloson. With Bertuzzi in the penalty box, Pascal Dupuis of the Wild scored his second goal of the game to make it 4-2 with 2 minutes 33 seconds left.</p>
        <p>When asked if he had envisioned such success so soon, Wild Coach Jacques Lemaire replied: ''Are you kidding? Never in a million years.''</p>
        <p>Much of the credit for the Wild's success goes to Lemaire, who coached the Devils to their first Cup in 1995. He favors a rigid and disciplined defensive system. But look at all the scoring. With a patient and opportunistic approach against Vancouver, the Wild scored 16 goals in the final three games.</p>
        <p>Leading them is the speedy Marian Gaborik, a 21-year-old left wing from Slovakia who was the team's first-round choice (third over all) in the 2000 entry draft. He has nine goals and eight assists in the playoffs. On the other end of the star spectrum is Minnesota's second-leading scorer, Wes Walz, who has seven goals and six assists. His third-period goal Thursday night tied the score at 2-2.</p>
        <p>Walz, who turns 33 on May 15, bounced around four N.H.L. teams and five minor league teams and played four seasons in Switzerland before signing as a free agent with the Wild in the summer of 2000. Like many of his teammates, he has finally found a niche in the Twin Cities. ''Maybe the hockey gods are on our side,'' Walz told The St. Paul Pioneer Press. ''I never used to believe in them, but I believe in them a lot more now.''</p>
        <p>Minnesota now takes an unfamiliar position. The Wild has home-ice advantage because it is seeded sixth and the Ducks are seeded seventh. Until this season, Anaheim had qualified for the postseason twice in nine seasons and won only one round. But the Ducks, behind goalie Jean-Sébastien Giguère, swept the defending champion Detroit Red Wings in the four-of-seven-game first-round series, then eliminated Dallas in six games in the second round.</p>
        <p>Giguère, from Montreal, is one of three French Canadian goalies who will have starring roles in the conference finals. The most prominent is Martin Brodeur of the Devils, who is also from Montreal. The third is Ottawa's Patrick Lalime, born in St. Bonaventure, Quebec. (The most accomplished goalie from Quebec of this era, Patrick Roy of Colorado, is said to be considering retirement.)</p>
        <p>Speaking of French Canadian influence: if Minnesota and Ottawa advance, the championship round will match coaches named Jacques -- Lemaire of the Wild and Martin of the Senators.</p>
        <p>Lemaire; Doug Risebrough, the Wild's general manager; Guy Lapointe, the team's coordinator of amateur scouting; and the assistant coach Mario Tremblay all learned their craft as players under Scotty Bowman in Montreal during the Canadiens' run of four straight Cups from 1976 to 1979. The Canadiens rarely make the postseason these days, and the Nordiques are long gone from Quebec City. But ''la belle province'' is well represented in the conference finals.</p>
