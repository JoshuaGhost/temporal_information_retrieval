      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Over the last decade or two, as the musicians of the bebop years have grown older, we've been lucky to notice something: the salutary effects of aging on that youthful music. Barry Harris's commitment to the pianists of the bop era, particularly Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, has been unequaled. And as he continues -- as a teacher and as a performer -- to reveal the mysteries of their music, the hard glint of the originals grows softer, the edges rounder, the lines more flexible and permeable.</p>
        <p>In other words, he plays the language of bebop more slowly, with its passing tones and curling phrases, and turns a hard-shell, macho art form into more voluptuous stuff.</p>

        <p>Over the last decade or two, as the musicians of the bebop years have grown older, we've been lucky to notice something: the salutary effects of aging on that youthful music. Barry Harris's commitment to the pianists of the bop era, particularly Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, has been unequaled. And as he continues -- as a teacher and as a performer -- to reveal the mysteries of their music, the hard glint of the originals grows softer, the edges rounder, the lines more flexible and permeable.</p>
        <p>In other words, he plays the language of bebop more slowly, with its passing tones and curling phrases, and turns a hard-shell, macho art form into more voluptuous stuff.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night at the Village Vanguard, where he continues through tomorrow night, he started with ''Sweet Lorraine.'' He found a beautiful, lazy tempo and played a one-chorus improvisation that was to be savored; then he returned to the theme and finished.</p>
        <p>He didn't try to be a sprinter or a philosopher with the song; he just gave it the gift of motion, showing you how the notes fit together, and his bassist, Earl May, and his drummer, Leroy Williams, let him spin it along.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harris honors a few basic principles of entertainment: that audiences want some level of involvement, and that they don't want to see things done by rote. So he played his tune ''Nascimento'' as he often does, eliciting claps and singing from the audience. (Immediately, the club was in fairly full voice; most in the crowd were used to the drill.)</p>
        <p>He also performed a slow, sweet, shrewd version of ''Memories of You,'' using some of Monk's eccentric rhythmic strategies, seemingly remembering them as he went along, and laughing as he did. At the end of the song, he threaded in the dire opening phrase of Powell's ''Dance of the Infidels,'' reharmonizing it a little, moving it through a few keys.</p>
        <p>Powell and Monk became the organizing principles of the set. Mr. Harris played ''All God's Children,'' made famous by Powell, assuming the fastest tempo of the evening, a touch above medium. He also played Powell's drifting solo piece ''Dusk in Sandi,'' full of unresolved chords, and Monk's ''Well, You Needn't,'' sometimes quieting his right hand altogether to reveal the soft, steady motion of the single-note harmony in the left.</p>
