        <p>Restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten simplifies making hollandaise sauce using soft whole butter instead of clarified butter; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The traditional recipe for rich hollandaise sauce -- useful for glorifying asparagus or to blanket eggs Benedict at brunch -- calls for clarified butter. But Jean-Georges Vongerichten does not bother melting his butter before making the sauce. ''When chefs start in my kitchen they think we're doing it wrong,'' he said. ''When you clarify the butter you throw out the part that has all the flavor and also some moisture. Hollandaise made with whole butter is tastier and lighter.'' For a generous cup of sauce, start with four egg yolks beaten with two tablespoons of water in a metal bowl over boiling water. Beat in half a pound of soft unsalted butter bit by bit. Finally, whisk in a little lemon juice, salt and pepper, and keep the sauce warm.</p>

        <p>Mr. Vongerichten is not alone in his approach. Though Julia Child gave the clarified butter version for hollandaise in her 1961 opus, ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' her recipe in ''From Julia Child's Kitchen'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1970), offered a choice: clarified or soft butter. Last week she went one step further. ''I've changed my point of view,'' she said. ''Now I think clarifying the butter is just a nuisance.''</p>
