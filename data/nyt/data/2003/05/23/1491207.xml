        <p>Imagine that you are skateboarding on water while being pulled by a powerful motorboat and you're on your way to understanding wakeboarding. One of the fastest-growing water sports, wakeboarding used to be the exclusive domain of teenage boys and a few movie-star enthusiasts like Keanu Reeves. But wakeboard instructors are now getting calls from men and women of all ages.</p>
        <p>''We have a guy who comes back regularly for lessons, and he's 75,'' said P. J. Marks, owner of the Wakeboard Camp in Clermont, Fla.</p>
        <p>Wakeboarding started in the late 1980's when surfers started riding on their boards while being pulled on a line behind a boat. Soon, surfers and surfboard manufacturers started designing smaller and more streamlined boards that came with bindings to hold riders' feet in place.</p>
        <p>Boat manufacturers then started producing special models with increased power and extra weight to create bigger wakes. By the mid-1990's, wakeboarding joined the ranks of extreme sports, complete with its own gear, vocabulary, professional circuit and cable television coverage.</p>
        <p>The basics of wakeboarding are pretty easy to learn, said Michael Montana, head of the Miami Beach Wakeboard and Waterski School. In just a few lessons students learn how to get up, cross the wake, master different positions and maybe even try a jump, he said.</p>
        <p>Wakeboarding can be done on any lake with almost any kind of boat. Surfing experience can be helpful but water-skiers are not necessarily at an advantage. The lower speeds and side angles that wakeboarders use can throw an experienced water-skier for a loop.</p>
        <p>For a proper introduction, head to Florida, where more than 2,500 warm-water inland lakes and a surplus of pros-turned-instructors combine to make it the best place to learn the sport.</p>

        <p>THE WAKEBOARD CAMP  848 West Osceola Street, Clermont, Fla., (352) 394-8899; www.wakeboardcamp.com.</p>
        <p>A five-day program tailored to all levels, from beginner to pro, includes all equipment rentals, three half-hour sessions a day on the water as well as lessons on land and critiques of your rides, which are videotaped. The $1,100-a-person price includes lodging and food. P. J. Marks, the camp's owner and a former pro wakeboarder, says shorter packages can be arranged on an individual basis. Lodging is in the camp's dormitory or in one of three private apartments.</p>
        <p>MIAMI BEACH WAKEBOARD AND WATERSKI SCHOOL  Sealine Marina Pier 5, 555 NE 15th Street, Miami Beach, Fla., (305) 496-6313; www.wakeboardmiamibeach.com.</p>
        <p>Packages, three or five days, include all equipment rentals and 50 minutes on the water each day. Prices range from $260 to $420. Michael Montana, the owner and a former pro wakeboarder, will also take students for sessions of one to three hours ($140 to $420) to introduce them to the sport. Most Miami Beach hotels are convenient to the school's boats on Biscayne Bay. The school provides transportation from the moderately priced Whitelow Hotel (808 Collins Avenue, 305-398-7000; $125 to $150) and the more luxurious Delano Hotel (1685 Collins Avenue, 305-672-2000; rooms starting at $245) both in South Beach.</p>
