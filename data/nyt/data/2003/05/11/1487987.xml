        <p>''It's certainly not a wake,'' said Patricia A. Moores, an aviation lawyer who is stepping down as president of the association. ''But no one is grinning from ear to ear. We all recognize problems that we are reading about in the newspapers daily.''</p>
        <p>Joanne W. Young, also an aviation lawyer, will succeed Ms. Moores at the association, which has 200 members, each with at least five years' experience as an executive in aviation.</p>
