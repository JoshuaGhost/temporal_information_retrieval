      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Michael Paterniti's article (April 27) shed light on a critical, but rarely mentioned, issue surrounding North Korean refugees, which is their livelihood upon arrival in South Korea. The piece also previews the potential effects of a Korean reunification, showing the insurmountable challenges faced by North Koreans when they're forced to assimilate to a culture that is Korean but foreign to them as well.</p>
        <p>My family roots lie in the Northern part of the Korean peninsula in a city called Hamhung. My grandmother and my father escaped the North in 1946 in a manner similar to that of the children mentioned in the article, having foreseen the effects of Communism and Kim Il Sung's influence in North Korea. My grandmother and father risked their lives to escape to the South. They were even shot at by Soviet soldiers stationed along the 38th parallel.</p>

        <p>It is because of such courageous efforts on their part that I was born into comfort and considered freedom a given throughout my life. It is my hope that in the not too distant future, the North Korean people will not have to escape their homeland to seek freedom. Instead, I hope the ones taking freedom away from the North Korean people are rooted out for good.</p>
