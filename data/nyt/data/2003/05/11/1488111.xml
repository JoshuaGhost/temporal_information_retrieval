        <p>For Krista Davey, late-game heroics are becoming routine.</p>
        <p>Davey, who scored the winning goal last week in the 91st minute at Philadelphia, took advantage of a misplay by Kate Sobrero of the Boston Breakers tonight and scored in the 89th minute, giving the Power a 3-2 victory at Mitchel Field. Davey had entered the game in the 73rd minute.</p>
        <p>''We sent her in because her pace and energy definitely add a different dimension to our offense,'' Coach Tom Sermanni said of Davey, who was also a late-game substitution last week. ''A win like this is great because it gives them a lot of confidence, but it doesn't do me any good.''</p>
        <p>Davey's goal was a product of good positioning and luck. Margaret Tietjen of the Power played a long ball across the field that bounced over Sobrero's foot. Davey ran to the ball in the penalty area, played the bouncing ball off her chin, and fired a shot past goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc. ''I just kept thinking, 'Play the mistake,' '' Davey said. ''It was unlucky for Kate, but we'll take it.''</p>
        <p>Christie Welsh and Joanne Peters also scored for the Power. Maren Meinert scored twice for the Breakers.</p>
        <p>After losing their first three games of the season, the Power (3-3) has won three straight. Boston fell to 3-2-1.</p>
