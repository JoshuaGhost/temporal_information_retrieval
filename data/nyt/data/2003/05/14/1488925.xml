        <p>The new directors of Ullico, the troubled union-owned insurer, voted to require directors who made more than $6 million trading company stock to return those profits within 30 days. Seventeen directors bought Ullico shares and then resold them to the company in 2000 at a far higher price set by the board in a deal that is the subject of four insider trading investigations. Three directors have already agreed to return their profits, and the board's resolution said Ullico would take steps to remove directors who did not repay the money and would seek to recoup money from them.</p>
