        <p>It's been only a few weeks since Lespinasse, the restaurant in the St. Regis, closed, but its chef, Christian Delouvrier, has not wasted time. He has plans for two restaurants, one a country-style place, Terre, to open this summer at 861 Washington Street (14th Street), where he will serve terrines and rotisserie meats. In the fall he plans to open Delouvrier, 150 East 50th Street, with a more high-end menu, including food from southwestern France.</p>
