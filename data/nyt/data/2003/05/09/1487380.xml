        <p>A lawsuit by the N.A.A.C.P. seeking to force gun makers and distributors to do more to stop criminals for buying guns went to a federal jury in Brooklyn yesterday after six weeks of testimony.</p>
        <p>The association has maintained that the gun industry knows of many ways in which gun dealers could be monitored to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands but has not taken action for fear of appearing responsible for gun violence.</p>
        <p>The gun makers say the suit is baseless. They comply with all relevant laws on gun sales, they say, and should not be held responsible for what happens to a gun after it is legally sold.</p>
        <p>The suit, filed in United States District Court in Brooklyn against more than 80 manufacturers and distributors, does not seek money damages.</p>
        <p>Rather, the N.A.A.C.P. is hoping that Judge Jack B. Weinstein declares the gun industry a public nuisance and orders gun makers to institute more checks on their customers, the dealers.</p>
        <p>The case could be rendered moot, however, by a pending federal bill that would retroactively shield the gun industry from most lawsuits. The bill has passed the House of Representatives and is now before the Senate.</p>
        <p>The N.A.A.C.P.'s case relies heavily on statistical analysis of a registry of guns recovered by law enforcement that is maintained by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and was suppressed for years.</p>
        <p>The association's experts testified that certain dealers and manufacturers were far more likely to have their handguns become ''crime guns'' than others, that some practices by dealers were associated with crime guns and that gun makers and distributors, if they wanted to, could pressure dealers to screen their customers more thoroughly.</p>
        <p>Gun makers countered the association's experts with their own, who said the N.A.A.C.P.'s analytical methods were shoddy.</p>
        <p>In their closing arguments, lawyers for gun makers said the association had not conclusively linked them to any illegal activity.</p>
        <p>A lawyer working with the N.A.A.C.P. told jurors that in a civil case like this, they did not have to find gun makers guilty of any crime.</p>
