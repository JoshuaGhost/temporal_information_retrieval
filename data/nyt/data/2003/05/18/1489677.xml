        <p>High School  Diamond Ranch High School, Pomona, Calif.  Built 2000, 1,950 students and staff members  Cost of hillside site: $1. Cost to stabilize site: $5 million. Payoff to students: a school that looks as if ''an earthquake happened.''</p>
        <p>Compared with the complex, conflicting and often downright inscrutable nature of the students for whom it was built, Diamond Ranch High School, 35 miles east of Los Angeles in Pomona, Calif., is, well, kid stuff. A bravura integration of landscape, form and modernist architectural thinking is one thing, but being a teenager is quite another. Since the school's completion in 2000, critics have swooned over its shimmering combination of metal, concrete and glass, its undulating lines, gymnastic geometry and spectacular hilltop location. But the critics don't necessarily have the final word. June 2001 marked the graduation of the first class to attend the school for all four years. (More than two years were spent in portable classrooms that are still in use.) In that time, a whole other set of critical opinions has formed.</p>

        <p>Compared with the complex, conflicting and often downright inscrutable nature of the students for whom it was built, Diamond Ranch High School, 35 miles east of Los Angeles in Pomona, Calif., is, well, kid stuff. A bravura integration of landscape, form and modernist architectural thinking is one thing, but being a teenager is quite another. Since the school's completion in 2000, critics have swooned over its shimmering combination of metal, concrete and glass, its undulating lines, gymnastic geometry and spectacular hilltop location. But the critics don't necessarily have the final word. June 2001 marked the graduation of the first class to attend the school for all four years. (More than two years were spent in portable classrooms that are still in use.) In that time, a whole other set of critical opinions has formed.</p>
        <p>Diamond Ranch was designed by the architect Thom Mayne and his Santa Monica firm, Morphosis. ''I wanted something optimistic,'' he said recently during a return visit to the campus. ''You see schools here in California that are so pragmatic they convey a pessimism, even when brand new.''</p>
        <p>Set into a bare hill, Diamond Ranch is composed of two two-story buildings bisected by a long, ravine-like ''main street'' that feeds a central courtyard. Upper and lower buildings each have their own classrooms and offices, the lower ones jutting out over graded playing fields in three perpendicular wings. Anchoring the front entrance is a gymnasium with a jagged roof.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, Diamond Ranch was built to the budgetary and pro forma specifications that, by state law, guide the construction of every high school built in California. In 1993, when ground was first broken, Diamond Ranch's construction budget of $29 million was equivalent to that of other new schools of similar size in the state. But few could match its setting: 72 acres, 1,900 feet above Pomona Valley, with a 270-degree view. ''We had an amazing site,'' says Patrick Leier, superintendent of the Pomona Unified School District. ''There are 26 million people from San Diego to Los Angeles and very little undeveloped land. We had literally one of the few multi-acre sites left.''</p>
        <p>More than 30 architectural firms entered a competition to win the project, and the prospective architects were given a philosophy statement to guide their designs. ''We said we wanted something optimistic, flexible, and something offering personalization,'' Leier explains. An independent peer-review jury chose Morphosis.</p>
        <p>Earlier this spring, I spent three days among Diamond Ranch students -- a racially, ethnically and socioeconomically diverse group that mirrors Pomona's population of 150,000. The experience revealed a school that was in some ways unusual and in other ways quite conventional.</p>
        <p>The building is palpably modern and dynamic, but school banners still find their way onto the corrugated metal walls and gum still grinds its way into the pores of the cement corridors, and there is still the controlled burst of human electricity of 1,850 high-school students. Like watching the ocean break on an exotic stretch of beach, the sight of the full array of Diamond Ranch High's 14- through 18-year-olds gushing through campus during the six-minute intervals between classes seems both stunningly new and acutely familiar.</p>
        <p>School is a school is a school  And high-school kids are high-school kids, even when their school wins architectural awards. Students of Diamond Ranch are more likely to notice where the popular crowd hangs out than the angle at which their classrooms cantilever over the playing fields. On a sunny, breezy afternoon, Phillip Rodriguez, 16, a sophomore, and Robbie Kimbal, 17, a junior, kicked around a hackeysack while talking with their friend Evan Meza, 17, also a junior. The three offered a sampling of how students interpret the building.</p>
        <p>KIMBAL: Most schools are falling apart. This one feels like it will stand for a while. Most people think it's pretty awesome.  RODRIGUEZ: It looks like a prison, though, all concrete and cold.  KIMBAL: And gray. I wish there was more color.  RODRIGUEZ: But you can come here to the track and totally hide or do whatever. There are lots of little spots like that.  MEZA: We should feel lucky to be here, this school is pretty special, and you feel special to be here. That's good.  RODRIGUEZ: Different people like different things about it. The skaters like it because there are lots of cool places to skate, even though you can't skate. The hard-core punkers like hanging out in the dark hallways. The Asians seem to like it in front of the cafeteria.  KIMBAL: Then there are the hot chicks, but you never know where they're going to be.  MEZA: But it's cool. Everyone mostly gets along and respects each other. That's probably the best thing about the school.</p>
        <p>Hearsay  Most students said they felt that the school's design was meant to be symbolic -- but of what, exactly, was the subject of some speculation.</p>
        <p>VANESSA VANN, 17, junior, student government: I heard our school was supposed to look like a diamond in the rough, from a plane overhead. That's why it has so many angles.  KRYSTLE COBIAN, 16, junior, student government: The school reminds me of an earthquake, like the whole building was straight and then an earthquake happened, which obviously symbolizes California.  CHRISTINA TORRES, 16, sophomore, cheerleader: Kids at other schools around here like to say that we're stuck-up rich kids on the hill, but it's not like that. We get stereotyped. It's not true. But that's what the other schools, especially the other ghetto schools, say.</p>
        <p>The importance of being different  As teen movies teach us, high school is a time marked by the tension between wanting to fit in and figuring out how to be an individual. But Diamond Ranch students seem convinced that being different is the ultimate goal. Many say it's an ideal reinforced, if not inspired, by their school's design.</p>
        <p>KAMILLE SOLER, 17, junior, class president: You know how teenagers are always trying to be different and always trying to find their identity? Well, I'm in a school that looks different and has its own personality. So when they see this, it's like, Whoa, it's O.K. for me to be different and have my own personality.  CHAD CADELINA, 17, senior, editor of the school newspaper: Because the school is kind of plain in terms of color but still so interesting in terms of design, it makes you look around and understand the diversity around you. This might sound weird, but the bleak backdrop we have brings out the color within us.  MEGAN BAKER, 16, sophomore, yearbook: I wouldn't recommend this look for other schools, because then ours wouldn't be original anymore. Being different is good. I think we came to realize that here.</p>
        <p>MAYNE, the architect, wasn't entirely surprised to hear what the students said. He returns a few times a year to see how the building is doing. ''I like to see the place is acquiring a patina of use,'' he said. ''I'm happy with how it's holding up, and I ask what they think. A kid mentions the word 'prison' and I want to choke, but most recognize that's the opposite of what's going on.''</p>
        <p>For Mayne, though, there is a bigger concern: does the building edify?</p>
        <p>''The whole idea was for the building to be a part of the educational process. Does it do that? I think you just have to have faith it has an effect on the kids. The truth is, it's hard to know.'' And it may be too early to know how much of an effect it has had on new schools in Southern California and around the country. Superintendent Leier notes that ''changes come more slowly to the world of education than the architectural world.''</p>
        <p>But Mayne and Leier proudly noted a more specific but no less notable impact. ''Around two weeks ago a young guy called my office,'' Mayne recalled. ''He said he was a first-year architecture student at Berkeley and was a graduate of the Diamond Ranch Class of 2002. He came in a few days later and said the school made him want to become an architect. That's a direct connection, and that's great.''</p>
