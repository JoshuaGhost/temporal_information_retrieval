        <p>Global fund managers polled by Merrill Lynch this month said they were encouraged by the earnings of American corporations in the first quarter but remained wary about the prospects for the world economy.</p>
        <p>The managers raised their forecast of average earnings growth per share over the next 12 months to 8 percent from 6 percent, their estimate in surveys in March and April.</p>
        <p>But most fund managers said growth in global corporate earnings would probably depend more on cost-cutting than on increasing revenue.</p>
        <p>The managers rated the United States as the country with the most solid corporate earnings and with the best prospects for earnings growth, displacing Britain.</p>
        <p>The survey of 300 managers, who handle $732 billion in investments among them, was conducted from May 1 to 8.</p>
