        <p>TO see a stunning example of the latest in English horticulture, one need travel only as far as Midtown. There, in the underground performance space of the Manhattan Theater Club on West 55th Street, a romantic wildflower meadow seems to be not only in full bloom, but swept by the wind and humming with life.</p>
        <p>This blowsy, naturalistic garden is the handiwork of the English set designer Tim Hatley, and it provides the setting for Charlotte Jones's ''Humble Boy.'' A sort of modern ''Hamlet'' with a happier ending, the play first ran at the Royal National Theater in London and opens in New York today in a separate production starring Blair Brown and Jared Harris.</p>

        <p>TO see a stunning example of the latest in English horticulture, one need travel only as far as Midtown. There, in the underground performance space of the Manhattan Theater Club on West 55th Street, a romantic wildflower meadow seems to be not only in full bloom, but swept by the wind and humming with life.</p>
        <p>This blowsy, naturalistic garden is the handiwork of the English set designer Tim Hatley, and it provides the setting for Charlotte Jones's ''Humble Boy.'' A sort of modern ''Hamlet'' with a happier ending, the play first ran at the Royal National Theater in London and opens in New York today in a separate production starring Blair Brown and Jared Harris.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatley and John Caird, the director, decided to forgo the traditional lawn-with-borders garden suggested in the script in favor of something less literal. Last year, the London set helped Mr. Hatley win an Olivier Award (the English equivalent of a Tony).</p>
        <p>In both productions, a stone terrace is surrounded -- engulfed, really -- by gently mounded hills covered in four-foot grasses dotted sparsely with wild rose, thistle and poppy. Amid this grassy profusion, cut through by narrow paths all but invisible to the audience, a large beehive rises above the stalks. There is an Alice in Wonderland quality to the set that is a fitting expression for the interior state of the title character -- Felix Humble (played by Mr. Harris), who, though intellectually brilliant, is emotionally stuck in an adolescent struggle with his mother (Ms. Brown).</p>
        <p>Wild gardens and meadows are in vogue now. Dan Pearson, a fashionable British garden designer who takes his cues from ecology, has made gardens that appear almost identical to this one. He said that people want meadows because they ''look back to a lost time, before the countryside and our lives were so urbanized.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hatley seems to have been responding to similar desires. ''I wasn't thinking, 'I want to make a trendy garden,' '' he said by telephone from London. ''I would just love to have a garden like that, with its decayed splendor.'' It seems odd that his fake, however breathtaking, can invoke the same response as the real thing. ''I was surprised myself at how well it works,'' Mr. Hatley said. ''In London, people almost started sneezing and thought they were going to get hay fever.''</p>
        <p>The production crew went to considerable trouble and expense to make this garden of painted grass and plastic flowers convincing. The grass is real but dried. It is bear grass, harvested mostly for use in dried-flower bouquets. Each blade was laid out, spray-painted two colors of green (the tips are lighter to simulate desiccation from the sun) and then fireproofed. Some blades were taped onto strips of fabric fixed to a stairlike construction to create the hills, while others were glued into small clumps and ''planted'' into polystyrene forms. The blades closest to the audience were painstakingly placed into the ground one at a time. The garden required the skills of 12 carpenters, 10 painters and 4 prop people working 6 days a week for 2 months. This is not necessarily more labor or artifice than an actual planted meadow requires. It takes four to five years of hard work before a meadow becomes low-maintenance.</p>
        <p>Part of the power of Mr. Hatley's set is that, despite its attempts at realism -- the way a low side-light (Paul Pyant created the lighting) rakes through the blades of grass, creating little halos along the edges of the flowers in the precise way the sun does on a perfectly clear late afternoon in summer -- it is also a highly theatricalized version of reality. The entire stage space is essentially filled with grass, and everything in it, including the terrace and the soil, is painted green. Appearing simultaneously natural and like an abstract installation, the set seems to draw on the psychological effect that large areas of grass can induce.</p>
        <p>''The pull of meadows goes deeper than your own actual experience,'' said Piet Oudolf, a Dutch horticulturalist working with the Battery Conservancy to create a master planting plan for Battery Park. ''It is a longing for things you never knew.''</p>
        <p>In drawing on these deeply emotional ideas, Mr. Hatley's unusual set makes reference to Eden -- another garden that never suffered for not being real.</p>
