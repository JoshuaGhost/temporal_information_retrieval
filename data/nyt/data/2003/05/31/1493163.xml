Coach Todd Shell, who took over for John Gregory after the team began the season 0-4, has yet to lose a road game.</p>
        <p>The Dragons, who were 2-6 at home during the regular season, will be on the road again tomorrow when they face the Orlando Predators.</p>
        <p>''As far as the road, I think that it's just getting away from everything and being together as a team,'' receiver Chris Anthony said. ''There's just a focus that you get when you do that. I think that is one of the reasons we've played so well on the road.''</p>
