        <p>Saying black people are in danger of being left behind at the newest frontier of medical research, Howard University plans to create the nation's largest repository of DNA from African-Americans.</p>
        <p>The samples would be used to find genes involved in diseases with particularly high rates among blacks like hypertension and diabetes.</p>
        <p>The plan, to be announced today at Howard, a historically black institution in Washington, is to gather blood samples or cheek swabs from 25,000 people over five years, mainly patients at hospitals associated with the Howard College of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Dr. Floyd J. Malveaux, dean of the medical school, said genetic information would increasingly find the causes of disease, predict susceptibility to an illness and choose which drugs would work best for a particular patient. It is important, Dr. Malveaux said, that the health concerns of blacks are included in this research. In the past, he said, such concerns have often not received enough attention.</p>
        <p>''We want to make sure as genetics move forward, as information is collected, as data is being mined, that we are part of that process,'' Dr. Malveaux said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Genetic studies of ethnic groups raise concerns because of fears that they could be used or distorted to justify discrimination against a group or to promote stereotypes.</p>
        <p>''There's always a sensitivity when geneticists start talking about ethnic groups,'' said Dr. Stephen J. O'Brien, chief of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md.</p>
        <p>An international project to study genetic differences among ethnic populations was abandoned in the 1990's after some groups argued that the information might be used to exploit them.</p>
        <p>Scientists had to consider such sensitivities in creating a newer program, the International HapMap Project, which will map DNA patterns of certain ethnic groups.</p>
        <p>Among African-Americans in particular, distrust lingers over a federally financed syphilis study in the 1930's. In that study, researchers withheld medical treatment from black men in Tuskegee, Ala.</p>
        <p>''There is certainly a danger,'' said Dr. Randall W. Maxey, president-elect of the National Medical Association, which represents African-American doctors. But Dr. Maxey, a kidney specialist in private practice in Los Angeles, said that the research was important and that the involvement of Howard should allay fears that the information might be misused.</p>
        <p>''From a political sense,'' he said, ''a lot of us trust Howard University much more than many other institutes involved in this.''</p>
        <p>Officials involved in the Howard library rejected the idea of harming African-Americans. Given the disparities in health care for blacks, ''the only thing controversial in my mind is not pursuing that,'' said Arthur L. Holden, president of First Genetic Trust, a company in Chicago chosen to help create the databank, the GRAD Biobank, for Genomic Research in the African Diaspora.</p>
        <p>First Genetic specializes in organizing genetic information while concealing patients' identities.</p>
        <p>Howard is the latest institution to try to capitalize on the increasing use of DNA samples to find genetic variations that contribute to disease. Scientists say samples have to be collected in a standardized procedure with the informed consent of the donors. The samples should also be accompanied by information on the patients' medical histories and health.</p>
        <p>Hospitals are a natural place to gather such samples and medical information; several are starting such DNA or tissue banks. The North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System in New York announced plans for a tissue bank this month. Private companies like Genomics Collaborative in Cambridge, Mass., and Ardais in nearby Lexington, are also building repositories.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael J. Pellini, president of Genomics Collaborative, said that although his DNA bank had a fair number of samples from African-Americans, a repository that focused specifically on that group was a good idea.</p>
        <p>''I cannot think of another biobank or another database that has a very significant African-American population,'' Dr. Pellini said.</p>
        <p>Some gene-hunting studies have been conducted on the populations of Iceland and the Mormons of Utah, both primarily Caucasian.</p>
        <p>African-Americans have higher incidences of certain diseases like high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes and renal failure.</p>
        <p>Responses to drugs can also be different. Some studies show that 40 percent of African-Americans compared to 60 percent of Caucasians responded well to beta blockers, a class of drugs for lowering blood pressure.</p>
        <p>It is not known to what extent such differences in health arise from genetic, environmental or social factors. Some scientists say that race is not a useful concept in medicine, that genes can vary as much within races as much as between them. Other experts say that genetic variations tend to cluster in ethnic groups and that it is foolhardy to ignore such differences.</p>
        <p>''There's 10 times more difference between a white person and his Caucasian wife than between a white population and an African population,'' Dr. O'Brien said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he added, studies of African-Americans could be useful in finding disease-related genes.</p>
        <p>''I don't think we should close our eyes to that because we are squeamish,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Howard is already conducting genetic research at its Human Genome Research Center and has expressed its intention to collect samples, though it is announcing the contract today for just the repository.</p>
        <p>Dr. Malveaux said patients at Howard University Hospital with certain diseases would be asked to donate samples and sign consent forms. Samples from nonblacks would not be excluded, he said, but given the population Howard serves, the samples will primarily be from African-Americans.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Howard medical school alumni globally will be asked to recruit donors for samples.</p>
        <p>He said patients would not be penalized in terms of care if they did not participate. Patients would not be paid for their samples, although expenses might be reimbursed in some cases, for example if a patient made a special trip to the hospital.</p>
        <p>The information would be made available to Howard researchers, as well as outside scientists and drug companies. Dr. Malveaux said that the project would cost a few million dollars per disease studied and that the university hopes to earn that total by conducting research on the samples sponsored by the government and drug companies.</p>
