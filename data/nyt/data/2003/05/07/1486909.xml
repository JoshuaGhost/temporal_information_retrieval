      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. said today that he was stepping down as the White House budget director, and Republicans said he was all but certain to return to his home state, Indiana, to run for governor.</p>
        <p>His resignation, effective in 30 days, completes an overhaul in the top ranks of President Bush's original economic team, including the forced departure late last year of Paul H. O'Neill as Treasury secretary and Lawrence B. Lindsey as director of the National Economic Council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels, in contrast, had remained a favorite of the president, who called him Blade for his budget-cutting fervor. Last month the president, Vice President Dick Cheney and Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, walked into a meeting with Mr. Daniels in the Roosevelt Room, across the hall from the Oval Office, wearing buttons saying ''My Man Mitch,'' teasing the budget director about the effort by some Republicans in Indiana to draft him to run for governor.</p>
        <p>''He has been a really good watchdog of the taxpayers' money,'' Mr. Bush told reporters today. ''I'm going to miss him. On the other hand, this administration's loss is the gain of the people of Indiana.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels was much less popular on Capitol Hill, where he made enemies in both parties with his sometimes acerbic advocacy of limited government and his efforts to pry from Congress additional power over spending.</p>
        <p>But while he has been a champion of holding down spending, the expenses of fighting and defending against terrorism led him to shepherd through Congress some of the biggest increases in decades. Despite his reputation as tightfisted, he oversaw the budget during a period when it swung from huge projected surpluses to large deficits, and he will be leaving Washington as Democrats step up their attacks on what they describe as the White House's fiscal mismanagement.</p>
        <p>In an interview tonight, Mr. Daniels said he did not want to talk about his plans or confirm that he would run for governor. ''I'm going to give President Bush 30 more days of hard work,'' he said. ''Then I'm going to load up the car and think about the future when I get home.''</p>
        <p>There was no word from the White House on a successor. Initial speculation centered on Mr. Daniels's deputy, Clay Johnson, one of Mr. Bush's oldest friends, though some administration officials said the president was likely to consider candidates with deeper experience in the complex policy and politics of the budget.</p>
        <p>Republican Party officials in Indiana said Mr. Daniels had not made a formal decision to enter the 2004 race for governor. But they said that they expected him to do so and that if he did, he would be a formidable candidate in a state that has been reliably Republican in presidential politics but where Democrats have been strong in statewide races.</p>
        <p>''Mitch has the intellectual ability, the political acumen and the business management experience to move Indiana into the 21st century,'' said Jim Kittle, chairman of the Indiana Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kittle -- who ended a telephone interview this morning by saying he had to take a call from Mr. Daniels -- said he was not offering an endorsement or favoring Mr. Daniels over other Republican candidates. But he said a decision by Mr. Daniels to enter the race would almost certainly lead some of the other Republicans to give way. There are already four declared Republican candidates to replace the Democratic governor, Frank L. O'Bannon, barred by Indiana law from seeking a third term. They include David McIntosh, a former member of Congress who lost to Mr. O'Bannon in 2000 by 15 percentage points.</p>
        <p>The Democratic candidates include Joe Andrew, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Vi Simpson, a state senator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels has been exploring the possibility of a race for governor for some time, and his long ties to the most popular Republican in Indiana, Senator Richard G. Lugar, would help him mobilize support among party activists and overcome a relatively low public profile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar issued a statement today hinting at support for Mr. Daniels, who worked for him as an aide when Mr. Lugar was mayor of Indianapolis and who then followed him to Washington as a Senate aide.</p>
        <p>''I look forward to finding new opportunities in which we can serve the people of Indiana, together, even more effectively,'' Mr. Lugar said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daniels has also served as the White House's political director, during the Reagan administration, and later as a senior executive of the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly &amp; Company, based in Indianapolis. Throughout his time as budget director, he has commuted regularly to his Indianapolis home, where his wife and four daughters lived while he stayed in an undecorated apartment in Washington.</p>
        <p>''I've got nothing on the walls, I always say, for two reasons,'' Mr. Daniels remarked last year. ''One, I want the damage deposit back, and secondly, whenever this job is over, I'll be gone quickly.''</p>
