        <p>WILLOW TEMPLE</p>
        <p>New &amp; Selected Stories.</p>
        <p>By Donald Hall.</p>
        <p>210 pp. Boston:</p>
        <p>Houghton Mifflin Company. $24.</p>
        <p>For most of the characters in Donald Hall's stories -- and that would include the New England countryside -- happiness is something experienced long ago. If you want to call it happiness: more like communion and contentment as prelude to suffering. This is Hall's territory, as readers of his poetry already know -- an anti-postcard of caved-in farmhouses, abandoned mills and people who stumble from promise into tragedy. Like Thomas Hardy, another rural poet who wrote downer fiction, Hall balances on sorrow's edge by virtue of an old-fashioned rigor; he never slips into self-pity on one side or sentimentality over the past on the other.</p>
        <p>He does lean though, now and then, in the direction of nostalgia. There's a slightly static quality to a few of the stories, as if Hall had them hold still while he got his points across: despite a consistent gift for delicate description, he can overstate the case. In ''Christmas Snow,'' the narrator bathes in warm memories of a long-ago Christmas, the narrative establishing, over and over, that here is a way of life that has passed. An aunt recites poetry (by John Greenleaf Whittier, no less). The little boy loves his grandfather's tales of the horse-and-buggy days. Until the last pages, when the idyll is interrupted (and the story rescued) by an uncle's bitter recollection of his father's cruelty, the characters seem generic in their homeliness.</p>
        <p>But there's a shrewdness about Hall you don't notice at first; he's not a New Englander for nothing. In ''The Figure of the Woods,'' a divorced dad, visiting his grandfather's now vacant farm with his citified son, is determined to make the boy ''a present of the past.'' But ''a father is not a grandfather,'' he realizes, especially if he works at John Hancock in Boston; the very effort to connect with the past shows what a lost cause this struggle is. The quiet loveliness of the details -- the father remembers fishing with his grandfather, ''their oars slipping in the flat water'' -- testifies to his long history with the place, even as it blinds him to how much of a ghost world this rural pocket has become. When father and son come across the rotting cadaver of possibly the last local farmer, we're seeing reality take revenge on illusion.</p>
        <p>Exile from the garden is a frequent theme of this book, which appropriately enough has a periodless feel, like a handsome cabinet built by a carpenter who settled on his style long ago. Hall, who has had a distinguished career as a poet, wrote these stories over a number of decades (six of the twelve entries appeared in ''The Ideal Bakery,'' published in 1987); you wouldn't necessarily know which came first. And yet, if he's not pushing the edge formally, neither is he dabbling; while the preoccupations remain the same, the newer stories seem more likely to sum up lifetimes, the apprehension of loss given stark outline by the unforgiving clarity of age.</p>
        <p>They're pretty unforgiving in general, these stories. Hall relishes the chance to have his characters face the hardest facts unprotected. But sometimes you wonder if he doesn't enjoy it too much -- if he doesn't cast events in the harshest light because, like the Romans he refers to in one story, he believes it a virtue to withstand pain. In ''From Willow Temple,'' 10-year-old Camilla (named after Virgil's warrior) secretly witnesses the near destruction of her parents' marriage. Though they patch things up, Camilla thinks that for them, as for her, nothing is the same again: ''I honored their brave, sad endeavor,'' she says of their later years together. And yet, from the bits of evidence the story supplies, it seems they got over it -- a less severe but perhaps more likely outcome than the one Hall pushes.</p>
        <p>Yet that toughness gives spine to an appreciation of life's irreconcilable conflicts. ''Lake Paradise,'' one of three stories about David Bardo, a State Department careerist, describes his youthful first love affair with working-class Alice Duboyce. Once he starts college, he breaks up with her. ''David knew that he loved her and that they could never be married.'' If Hall were any less stern, the story would collapse under the weight of its implied judgment. As it is, it seems only as cold as the truth.</p>
