        <p>FOR the exhibition ''Out of the Fire,'' at the Stedman Gallery here, Nancy Maguire, the gallery's curator, invited Anna Boothe, Jon Clark, Lucartha Kohler and Paul Stankard, nationally acclaimed artists and distinguished teachers in the Delaware Valley region, to display their sculptures.

        <p>The choices reveal the important mentoring relationship between faculty and students, yet this is not a two-tier exhibition. Looking at the 32 sculptures by the two groups of artists, in most cases, it is almost impossible to distinguish one generation from another.</p>

        <p>FOR the exhibition ''Out of the Fire,'' at the Stedman Gallery here, Nancy Maguire, the gallery's curator, invited Anna Boothe, Jon Clark, Lucartha Kohler and Paul Stankard, nationally acclaimed artists and distinguished teachers in the Delaware Valley region, to display their sculptures. She also asked each to select an artist whose work ''showed significant potential for artistic growth.''</p>
        <p>The choices reveal the important mentoring relationship between faculty and students, yet this is not a two-tier exhibition. Looking at the 32 sculptures by the two groups of artists, in most cases, it is almost impossible to distinguish one generation from another.</p>
        <p>''Out of the Fire'' begins with seven sculptures by Paul Stankard of Mantua, the only artist in the show who has a studio in southern New Jersey. His signature imagery of black-eyed Susans, blueberries and honeybees seems mystically suspended and enshrined in clear glass crystal; it requires intimate viewing from multiple directions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stankard has been a passionate admirer of native flowers, deeply inspired by the flora of the Pine Barren. But he has recently added masks as mythical and poetic elements to his pictorial repertoire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stankard selected Paul DeMarco, who masterfully combines traditional scientific glassmaking with flamework, manipulating the flame of a gas burner to melt glass rods. His four sculptures sardonically address biotechnology.</p>
        <p>For example, in ''Genetic Engineering Department: Pisum Sativum Periculum, Anamoly #2603202,'' Mr. DeMarco incorporates his fabrication of scientific glass vessels with the exaggerated representation of a plant that refuses to be confined by its beaker and test tube. Using ''periculum,'' the Latin word for dangerous, the artist wittingly augments the formal scientific name of the garden pea. With its climbing vine and enlarged blossoms, this experiment looks like something from a little laboratory of horrors.</p>
        <p>Lucartha Kohler's ''Bed of Leaves'' is a colorful arrangement of 150 cast glass leaves presented on a low bed-like platform. The original foliage came from numerous trees found at various sites, some as far away as Turkey and Armenia. If ''Tree of Leaves'' were enlarged, the trunk-like form with its glass leaf-covered surface could be a ravishing public monument.</p>
        <p>With these decorative sculptures, Ms. Kohler upstages Jessica Julius, who is represented by two installations that do not approach the older artist's accomplishment.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Anna Boothe's kiln-cast figurative forms with their ritualistic sensibility are overshadowed by the work of Tim Wagner, the artist she selected. His pieces are intensely provocative black glass sculptures, inspired by his wife's braided hair, which she cut on their honeymoon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner made a rubber mold of the original braid and then produced detailed wax positives, manipulating and replicating them before creating his final glass castings. ''Weight,'' the first of this series, is a triptych, which presents the severed plait like some tribal artifact. ''Untitled I'' is a lengthy serpentine, ropelike braid that hangs from the wall and coils on the floor, asserting its presence in the gallery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wagner's sculptures are compelling -- specific yet generic, figurative yet abstract, deliberate yet capricious, seductive yet repulsive.</p>
        <p>Jon Clark is represented by five abstract sculptures that possess an elegant simplicity of form and composition, playing glass against wood. ''A.G. Ovule'' is a pod-like design that rests on its wooden base, looking like a still life on a miniature Asian dining room table. The glass object is beautifully colored with a tactile surface that goes from rough to smooth, matte to shiny.</p>
        <p>Selected by Mr. Clark, Daniel Cutrone creates handsomely designed tea and coffee sets that suggest the technical virtuosity of an industrial glass blower. Each is displayed on a handcrafted cantilevered steel support like some chic counter at a European cafe.</p>
        <p>The brilliant colors of the teapot and its four cups and saucers are immediately captivating and almost irresistible, yet these pieces, with their misplaced handles and spout, are potentially dangerous. The title of the piece says it all: ''Il Servizio Sadomasochisto di Te (The Sadomasochistic Tea Service).''</p>
        <p>''Out of the Fire'' is at the Stedman Gallery at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, Third and Pearl Streets, Camden, through June 25. Information: (856)225-6609.</p>
