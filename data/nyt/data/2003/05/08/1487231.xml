      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Mark O'Brien backed up a few steps, so discreetly it took a moment to realize that he had been occupying the exact spot on Orchard Street where a man killed his son in January.</p>
        <p>''I don't like standing there,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he and his 18-year-old daughter, Carleigh, felt that walking through the crime scene was an important part of their visit to New York. It was their first time back since the days just after Burke O'Brien, 25, was shot in the chest during a robbery that netted $12 for the gunman and a masked accomplice.</p>
        <p>The O'Briens arrived last Thursday and left on Tuesday night, right after a stop on Orchard Street with Detective Kenneth Silvia, the lead investigator on the case.</p>
        <p>The trip had been fruitful, Mr. O'Brien said. Before they left, he told reporters that Forrest Bloede, 24, a friend of his son's and a witness to the slaying, had been reluctant to cooperate with the police. While they were en route from their home outside Chicago, Mr. Bloede, who had hesitated because the police initially suspected him in the killing, finally visited the Seventh Precinct on the Lower East Side.</p>
        <p>When the O'Briens arrived, they met Detective Silvia in person for the first time. The Police Department released a new sketch of the gunman, thought to be black or Hispanic, 5-foot-11 to 6 feet tall and 24 to 26 years old, and announced a $30,000 reward for his capture, money supplied in part by Mr. O'Brien.</p>
        <p>And the O'Briens made the trip to the quiet block of tenements where Burke had been staying, at Mr. Bloede's apartment at 75-79 Orchard Street, between Broome and Grand Streets. As Mark O'Brien neared the Fleet Bank A.T.M. where his son and Mr. Bloede withdrew $20 to pay a cabdriver after a night out with friends, Mr. O'Brien slipped off to get a ginger ale.</p>
        <p>But he returned, walking under the bright blue scaffolding his son and Mr. Bloede had walked under as they approached Mr. Bloede's building. He reached the doorway where the two friends had been about to enter when they turned to see two men standing there, one pointing a gun.</p>
        <p>But still, the closest Mr. O'Brien got to his son's killer was that spot on the sidewalk.</p>
        <p>''The people in Manhattan are in this with me,'' he had told a roomful of reporters at a news conference earlier. ''These guys are running around their neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>The case has been a frustrating one. The ballistic evidence did not match any guns on record in New York, Detective Silvia said. Until Mr. Bloede began to cooperate last week, after Mr. O'Brien publicly complained about his refusal to help the police, there was no good sketch of the suspect.</p>
        <p>There were many questions in the minds of Mr. O'Brien's four surviving children (Carleigh is the youngest), and he hoped to bring them some answers. ''I have a lot of kids with nightmares,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Every inch of the block of Orchard Street was photographed -- memorialized, in detective jargon -- shortly after the crime. On Tuesday night, life was moving on. People going into the building glanced half-curiously at the two men on their front stoop. Detective Silvia broke off in midconversation and ran across the street to a group of men, passing out copies of the new sketch.</p>
        <p>The visit was also a chance for Mr. O'Brien to try to provide some answers. Were the witnesses' accounts consistent with what he knew about his son? ''There were some things about Burke's personality that I can say, yes, that's the kind of thing he would say, that's the kind of thing he would do,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Detective Silvia said that sort of information could help. ''When you investigate a homicide, usually the first time you meet the victim, they're dead,'' he said. It is only through interviewing family and friends that a detective can get a sense of someone's personality and motives, he said.</p>
        <p>Why, for example, did Burke O'Brien take off his jacket and hang it on the railing as he stepped forward to try to convince the gunman, according to Mr. Bloede's statements, that robbery was not a good thing? ''Was he taking it off to show the guy, look, I don't have anything else?'' the detective asked. ''Did the gunman take it as a threat? I don't know, we might never know the answers.'' Then he said, ''I would really like to ask the guy.''</p>
