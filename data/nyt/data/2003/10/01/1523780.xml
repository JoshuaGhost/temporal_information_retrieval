        <p>Lincoln Center has received a $16 million grant from the Alice Tully Foundation toward the renovation of Alice Tully Hall, the center's prime stage for chamber music and jazz. The gift, announced yesterday, is the largest so far by a private donor for Lincoln Center's redevelopment project.</p>
        <p>The Alice Tully project is expected to begin in 2005, with a total cost of $56 million. It is to be part of the overall transformation of the West 65th Street portion of the Lincoln Center campus under a design by Diller &amp; Scofidio.</p>
        <p>Bruce Crawford, chairman of Lincoln Center, called the foundation's gift ''a vote of confidence'' in the redevelopment. James McGarry, president of the Alice Tully Foundation, said his organization had determined that the hall ''was in need of upgrading.''</p>
        <p>The grant is contingent on Lincoln Center's raising two and half times the $16 million for a total of $56 million. Reynold Levy, president of Lincoln Center, said yesterday that he was optimistic that the center could come up with the rest of the money. ''This is a significantly improved climate for fund-raising from what it was a year ago,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Renovations are to include an extensive updating of the 1,096-seat hall, an enlarged outer lobby, and expanded ''performer support'' areas like dressing rooms.</p>
        <p>Since it was first announced as a $1.5 billion project in 1999, Lincoln Center's redevelopment has been scaled back because of the economy. What the revised figure will be is not yet known because of uncertainties about renovations at Avery Fisher Hall, the home of the New York Philharmonic, which is considering moving out and merging with Carnegie Hall in 2006.</p>
        <p>Alice Tully Hall was built in 1969 with a gift from the singer Alice Tully, a granddaughter of the founder of Corning Glass Works; she died in 1993. The Alice Tully Foundation, established in 1953, gives grants primarily in the arts, education and human services.</p>
        <p>Tully Hall was conceived as the first major concert stage in New York City for chamber music. Today it serves as the home of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and a primary stage for performances and events presented by the Juilliard School, Jazz at Lincoln Center, the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Lincoln Center Inc., the center's umbrella organization.</p>
