        <p>James Morse, known as ''Pop Up'' to his family, has more than a few fantastic stories up his sleeve, and it doesn't take much coaxing from his 11-year-old grandson, Chris, to get him started. Circus ships foundering off the coast of Maine; elephants flailing in the sea: many of the vivid tales feature Pop Up as a worker on a circus boat, encountering adventure everywhere he turns and hanging on by the skin of his teeth in the face of disaster.</p>
        <p>But in ''Wilder Days,'' a movie that has its premiere on TNT tonight at 8, Pop Up -- who got his name from the lovely handmade children's books he has spent much of his adult life trying to publish -- has another, more insidious disaster to deal with. His strait-laced son -- Chris's father, John (Tim Daly) -- doesn't believe a word he says about circus boats and faraway cabins built from wrecked ships. And he bitterly resents a childhood during which his father spent too much time on the road trying to sell his pop-up books. Even worse, John's cynicism is infecting Pop Up's favorite listener, Chris (Josh Hutcherson). So Pop Up decides to create an adventure for the three of them: a road-trip in a sky-blue 1959 Cadillac and a final confrontation on a lonely Maine island where Pop Up's tales suddenly don't seem all that far-fetched.</p>

        <p>James Morse, known as ''Pop Up'' to his family, has more than a few fantastic stories up his sleeve, and it doesn't take much coaxing from his 11-year-old grandson, Chris, to get him started. Circus ships foundering off the coast of Maine; elephants flailing in the sea: many of the vivid tales feature Pop Up as a worker on a circus boat, encountering adventure everywhere he turns and hanging on by the skin of his teeth in the face of disaster.</p>
        <p>But in ''Wilder Days,'' a movie that has its premiere on TNT tonight at 8, Pop Up -- who got his name from the lovely handmade children's books he has spent much of his adult life trying to publish -- has another, more insidious disaster to deal with. His strait-laced son -- Chris's father, John (Tim Daly) -- doesn't believe a word he says about circus boats and faraway cabins built from wrecked ships. And he bitterly resents a childhood during which his father spent too much time on the road trying to sell his pop-up books. Even worse, John's cynicism is infecting Pop Up's favorite listener, Chris (Josh Hutcherson). So Pop Up decides to create an adventure for the three of them: a road-trip in a sky-blue 1959 Cadillac and a final confrontation on a lonely Maine island where Pop Up's tales suddenly don't seem all that far-fetched.</p>
        <p>Peter Falk, who plays the role of Pop Up, explained why he took the part in a recent telephone interview from Los Angeles. ''Like everybody else I'm a sucker for a great story,'' said Mr. Falk. ''And this guy is a great storyteller. When I read the script, there was nothing familiar about Pop Up; everything was unpredictable. In his words, this guy wants life to be spicy. He wants to be intrigued.''</p>
        <p>The curious, complex Pop Up figure wasn't made entirely out of thin air. He was, said Jeff Stockwell, the screenwriter, based on at least two people from his own family.</p>
        <p>''It would be crazy to call it autobiographical, but I did have a strange set of grandparents,'' said Mr. Stockwell in a telephone interview from Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Like Pop Up, Mr. Stockwell's grandfather built a cabin out of a wrecked ship in Maine. His grandmother, however, was the storyteller, and like Chris in ''Wilder Days,'' Mr. Stockwell would listen to her first-person tales of circus ships, only to learn later that the ship she was probably talking about existed in the mid-18th century, long before she was born.</p>
        <p>Despite the reality-distortion, Mr. Stockwell appreciated the stories. ''She pumped me up with a heightened sense of what was going around,'' he said, ''and that indirectly led me to writing and wanting life to be one or two stages more exciting than it is.''</p>
        <p>Craig Anderson, an executive producer of ''Wilder Days,'' said one of the most compelling aspects of the movie was the conflict between Pop Up and John.</p>
        <p>''Father and son stories don't come along often,'' Mr. Anderson said in a recent telephone interview from Los Angeles. ''I loved the story of these three generations of men who miss each other in the night and then come together at the end.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stockwell said he, too, had communication problems with his father, ''just like any red-blooded American male.'' But he hopes that the main character the television audience identifies with is Chris.</p>
        <p>''I very much want the audience to be in Chris's place -- hearing the stories and getting caught up in them, and then wondering on one level that these stories can't be real,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And should Pop Up be held accountable for not being there for his son?</p>
        <p>In Mr. Falk's opinion, the answer is no: ''In the course of the story he knew he was wrong, and he was trying to make up for it. And, as he says, everyone deserves a second chance.''</p>
