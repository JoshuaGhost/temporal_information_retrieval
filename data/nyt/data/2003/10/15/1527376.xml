        <p>And They Say He Lacks Dimension</p>
        <p>We are each -- if you will permit us a moment of philosophy -- the star of our own cartoon show, but we cannot help wondering if BOB EVANS isn't going to get himself sued.</p>
        <p>''Kid Notorious'' makes its debut on Comedy Central next Wednesday night. The animated characters are often real people and Mr. Evans provides his own voice. The first episode involves a fictional fight with SHARON STONE, who dumps an Evans project to go to New York and star in ''The Vagina Monologues.''</p>
        <p>''Someone put it into her head she can act,'' Mr. Evans says in the show, in one of his nicer, and cleaner, lines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans and Ms. Stone had their problems a decade ago when he was producing the thriller ''Sliver.'' She had him banned from the set; he later called her a ''sociopath.''</p>
        <p>What gives with them now, we asked at a press lunch yesterday at Michael's.</p>
        <p>''Nothing,'' Mr. Evans said.</p>
        <p>Then, ''We've had a very bad experience in the past'' and ''Let's say it this way: she doesn't like me.''</p>
        <p>So is the cartoon a way to settle scores?</p>
        <p>''It wasn't done out of spite; in the end it may help her.''</p>
        <p>Is he worried about hearing from her lawyer?</p>
        <p>''I couldn't care less. Couldn't care less.'' An impish smile. ''Hope I do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans, as the Hollywood producer Kid Notorious, wears a turtleneck, cashmere suit and silver bolo, and can say ''Baby, you take my breath away'' in 67 languages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Evans, in three dimensions, is similar. At 73, his hair is still thick and dark, his complexion deeply tan, the color of each suspect. Since having had a stroke a few years ago, he walks a little gingerly, but the ladies' man charm is fully operational. ''Put me between a blonde and a brunette,'' he said, as he arrived.</p>
        <p>We were distracted by his small rectangular very blue tinted glasses. Mr. Evans told us he had designed them for the Notorious character.</p>
        <p>The bolo?</p>
        <p>''That's all I wear,'' he said. ''I saw a belly dancer eight years ago. She had this on her belly and I loved it.'' Being a deal maker, Mr. Evans offered $100, a week later $300 and, finally, $1,000. ''It's the cheapest thing I ever bought,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The belly dancer's name was PERLA and she later became the wife of SLASH, of Guns N' Roses. Slash, who supplies his own voice, is also a character in ''Kid Notorious.''</p>
        <p>We hear, Mr. Evans, that you've crossed paths with PARIS HILTON?</p>
        <p>''Nice girl,'' Mr. Evans says. ''Funny girl. I don't know her that well.''</p>
        <p>She's been known to misbehave.</p>
        <p>''Nothing wrong with misbehaving. It all depends on how you misbehave. See, I can't misbehave in public. I never have. I'm a very, very reclusive person.''</p>
        <p>And if You Saw a Pictorial Of Sing Sing</p>
        <p>Condé Nast Traveler held its Readers' Choice Awards event at the Guggenheim the other day.</p>
        <p>In the crowd were CINDY CRAWFORD, RANDE GERBER, CHRIS NOTH, VENDELA, MARISKA HARGITAY and REBECCA ROMIJN STAMOS.</p>
        <p>Ms. Romijn Stamos, a Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, was wearing a low-cut black and white striped dress only somewhat less snug than the body paint she wore in her ''X-Men'' movies but our Sartorial Splendor award must go to the Giants linebacker DHANI JONES.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones wore blue flip-flops with his beige suit, gold bow tie and powder blue shirt.</p>
        <p>''Dhani has been trying to get a writing assignment from me since I met him a couple of years ago,'' said TOM WALLACE, the magazine's editor.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere -- no, dang it, you're too linguistically sophisticated a readership not to see through that tired journalistic segue -- in remarks having nothing at all to do with Mr. Jones's flip-flops -- LIEV SCHREIBER, who has just finished shooting a remake of ''The Manchurian Candidate,'' told us of a vacation he had impulsively booked in Brazil. (He had seen a ''gorgeous'' photograph in the magazine.)</p>
        <p>''There was kayaking, hiking, a very sporty guy trip,'' Mr. Schreiber said. ''So I just booked it. Then I got there and it turned out I had booked myself into an eight-day detox weight-loss spiritual-growth center. And I was the only man. It actually turned out to be a terrific vacation.''</p>
