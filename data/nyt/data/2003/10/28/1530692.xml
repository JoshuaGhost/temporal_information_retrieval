        <p>Surgeons can find themselves in high demand around Halloween, as people seek treatment for injuries, sometimes disabling, suffered while carving pumpkins.</p>
        <p>To reduce the risk, a new study suggests, people may be better off avoiding knives and getting specially designed pumpkin cutters. Although they are not foolproof, some of the carvers appear less likely to cause injury, the researchers found. The study was distributed last week by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how many people are injured each year while carving pumpkins, but last week another medical group, the American Society for Surgery of the Hand, issued a warning and endorsed the use of carvers. Every Halloween, the group said, adults and children are seriously hurt using knives.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alexander M. Marcus, a hand surgeon in Edison, N.J., said he got the idea for the study when he was a fellow at the SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse and treated a women who had suffered a serious tendon injury while carving a pumpkin. ''It occurred to me that there had to be a better way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He and his colleagues set out to compare kitchen knives and two brands of pumpkin carvers. They used machines that measured the amount of force needed for the different blades to pierce pumpkins and to carve them. The researchers then looked at what happened when the knives and carvers were used on the hands of cadavers with the same amount of force.</p>
        <p>The kitchen knives, they found, caused more serious skin injuries than the carvers did and were also more likely to hurt tendons.</p>
        <p>And while the carvers did not puncture the skin when wielded with the amount of force needed to pierce a pumpkin, the knives caused deep puncture wounds with even less force.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marcus stressed that the carving tools could also cause injuries, and were best left to adults. ''I think kids should paint pumpkins,'' he said.</p>
