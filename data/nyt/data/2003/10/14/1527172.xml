        <p>The Navy has reached an agreement with environmental groups that restricts the use of a powerful new sonar system that could injure marine life to an area in the western North Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists in California sued this year to stop the Navy from developing its new low-frequency active sonar system, often called L.F.A., which is more far-reaching than the midfrequency sonar system that has been blamed for mass whale beachings around the world.</p>

        <p>The Navy has reached an agreement with environmental groups that restricts the use of a powerful new sonar system that could injure marine life to an area in the western North Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists in California sued this year to stop the Navy from developing its new low-frequency active sonar system, often called L.F.A., which is more far-reaching than the midfrequency sonar system that has been blamed for mass whale beachings around the world.</p>
        <p>The agreement, reached Wednesday, does not ban the use of the sonar system but limits it to areas near the eastern seaboard of Asia.</p>
        <p>The Navy must avoid using L.F.A. along the coastline in that region, as well as restrict its use during migration periods for some whales, said Joel Reynolds, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''This demonstrates that environmental protection and preparedness for our national defense are not inconsistent but can be balanced,'' Mr. Reynolds said.</p>
        <p>The Navy had plans to use L.F.A. over 80 percent of the world's oceans, but Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Laporte of Federal District Court issued an injunction in August limiting its use and ordered the two sides to negotiate an agreement. The deal requires the judge's approval.</p>
        <p>The Navy says that low frequency sonar has never been conclusively linked to any whale deaths and that the agreement will hamper its ability to meet a growing threat from modern diesel submarines, which L.F.A. is designed to detect.</p>
        <p>''We are thankful the courts have allowed the Navy to use the system as opposed to saying we can't use it outright,'' Lt. Cmdr. Joseph Surette, a Navy spokesman, said. ''But this places limits on the ways our men and women in uniform can meet the threats from diesel submarines.''</p>
        <p>A study published last week in Nature found that midfrequency sonar could cause decompression sickness in whales, leading to strandings.</p>
