        <p>A certain inevitability accompanied Germany through the Women's World Cup. It dominated opponents with free-flowing, attacking soccer, fashioning goals with splendid touch, anticipation and technical skill, relentlessly building pressure both on the ground and in the air.</p>
        <p>When Sunday's engaging final persisted into overtime, Sweden appeared to finally grow tired, while Germany's players maintained fresh legs and a spry desire. In the 98th minute, midfielder Renate Lingor floated a free kick from 30 yards and the substitute defender Nia Kuenzer flicked a header beyond the outstretched arm of Sweden's goalkeeper, giving Germany a 2-1 victory before an announced crowd of 26,137 at the Home Depot Center.</p>

        <p>A certain inevitability accompanied Germany through the Women's World Cup. It dominated opponents with free-flowing, attacking soccer, fashioning goals with splendid touch, anticipation and technical skill, relentlessly building pressure both on the ground and in the air.</p>
        <p>When Sunday's engaging final persisted into overtime, Sweden appeared to finally grow tired, while Germany's players maintained fresh legs and a spry desire. In the 98th minute, midfielder Renate Lingor floated a free kick from 30 yards and the substitute defender Nia Kuenzer flicked a header beyond the outstretched arm of Sweden's goalkeeper, giving Germany a 2-1 victory before an announced crowd of 26,137 at the Home Depot Center.</p>
        <p>For the first time, a country that has produced a men's World Cup champion has also produced a Women's World Cup champion. Also for the first time in four Women's World Cups, the winning coach was a woman. Tina Theune-Meyer coached what was clearly the best team of this tournament, one that scored 25 goals and allowed 4 in six matches.</p>
        <p>The winning goal was delivered by perhaps the unlikeliest player. Kuenzer had scored only once in 32 previous appearances with Germany's national team. During the 2001 European championships, which Germany won over Sweden, 1-0, also in overtime on a so-called ''golden goal,'' Kuenzer drew attention as a television commentator, not as a player. She was hurt at the time, having sustained one of several knee injuries, and her place on this World Cup team was not secure.</p>
        <p>Entering in the 88th minute Sunday, two minutes from the end of regulation, Kuenzer hoped only to provide a spark with her encouraging voice and rested legs. When Germany was awarded a free kick in overtime, though, Lingor screamed ''Nia,'' signaling that she wanted Kuenzer as a target.</p>
        <p>She is only 5 feet 6 inches, but Kuenzer jumped, twisting her body as if to gather her strength about 12 yards from the goal, then drove a header just beneath the crossbar, out of reach of Sweden's goalkeeper, Caroline Joensson.</p>
        <p>''Every soccer player dreams of scoring the decisive goal in the World Cup,'' the 23-year-old Kuenzer said.</p>
        <p>As the ball reached the net, the Swedish players fell to the ground in despair. Twice in three years they had lost a tournament to Germany on a golden goal. Bitterness crept into their postgame assessments.</p>
        <p>The determining free kick was awarded after Referee Floarea Cristina Ionescu of Romania called a foul on the Swedish forward Victoria Svensson for an improper sliding tackle. But Svensson said she had won the ball cleanly from the German defender Kerstin Stegemann and accused Ionescu of attempting to ''destroy the game.''</p>
        <p>Marika Domanski Lyfors, Sweden's coach, said, ''If we should have to have lost this game, we should have done it fairly.''</p>
        <p>These harsh words, however, could not undercut Germany's creativity with short passes, its unremitting appetite for goals and its ability to counter Sweden's speed and insistence. As usual, the extremely fit Germans played stronger in the second half, after Sweden had taken a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute on a through pass by Svensson and 15-yard shot from Hanna Ljungberg.</p>
        <p>A minute into the second half, forward Birgit Prinz, the tournament's leading scorer and most valuable player, rolled a pass across the top of the penalty area to midfielder Maren Meinert, who was left unmarked. Meinert had trouble controlling the ball, but she did manage to ricochet it into the net off the foot of Joensson for the equalizer.</p>
        <p>Meinert had intended to retire before this World Cup, but she changed her mind after being named most valuable player of the Women's United Soccer Association. Sunday was her final game, and her most satisfying. Germany had finished second in the 1995 Women's World Cup but was viewed as a perennial underachiever. Not anymore, though interest in the women's national team lags far behind interest in the men's national team, which has won three World Cup titles.</p>
        <p>''In Germany, soccer is a man's game,'' Jana Wiske, a reporter for Kicker, Germany's most popular soccer magazine, said. Perhaps the women's professional league there will attract 700 fans a game now instead of 500, she said, compared with 6,700 in the W.U.S.A. The German women face a problem of cultural sexism from a public that does not consider the players sufficiently feminine, Wiske said.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Sunday's victory will encourage more young girls in Germany to take up the game, Theune-Meyer said.</p>
        <p>''I think many young kids saw this and will try to step forward,'' she said.</p>
