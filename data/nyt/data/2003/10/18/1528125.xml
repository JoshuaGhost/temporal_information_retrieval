        <p>Cantor Fitzgerald, the stock and bond trading firm, is negotiating to return to Lower Manhattan, where its work force was decimated by the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center two years ago.</p>
        <p>Only a year ago, Howard W. Lutnick, the chief executive of Cantor, had vowed that his firm would never go back to the neighborhood where 658 employees died in the collapse of Tower 1. But time has eased the emotional trauma, and relatively lower occupancy costs have made Lower Manhattan attractive.</p>
        <p>According to numerous real estate executives and government officials, Cantor is negotiating to buy a 200,000-square-foot office condominium at 10 Hanover Square, a building one block from Wall Street that is being vacated by Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>Executives in the financial district, as well as state and city officials, agree that Cantor's return would be a richly symbolic example of the beleaguered downtown district's rebound. But Mr. Lutnick is demanding an array of subsidies and has touched off a battle between the State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who supports Cantor, and, on the other side, city and state officials and the Real Estate Board of New York, an influential trade group.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the subsidies would welcome Cantor's return downtown from 57th Street and Lexington Avenue, but oppose ladling out any additional benefits beyond the $30 million in cash and millions of dollars in tax breaks, tax-free financing and low-cost electricity already available to the company if it moves to Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Few politicians or real estate executives are willing to tangle publicly with the Assembly speaker. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff would say only that the city was ''working on a solution.''</p>
        <p>The dispute has been simmering for months and is rife with policy disputes, blood feuds and a sense of the familiar.</p>
        <p>''With all due respect for the enormous loss of life at Cantor, the company shouldn't trade on the horrors of 9/11 to get an unconscionable windfall for a single company,'' said Harvey Robins, a top city administrator in the 1980's and early 1990's. ''Every time the city and state do these deals, we lose as a city because resources are not being equitably distributed.''</p>
        <p>Cantor lobbied successfully in Congress last year for a special appropriation for companies that ''suffered a disproportionate loss'' of their work force. State officials have agreed to give Cantor $24 million of the $33 million appropriation for a new headquarters.</p>
        <p>The company would also be eligible for an estimated $6 million grant from the federal Liberty Zone program to rebuild Lower Manhattan, as well as tax-free Liberty Bonds, accelerated depreciation and other tax breaks. Mr. Silver has proposed to amend an obscure city program in a way that would grant Cantor millions of dollars in additional tax breaks to move downtown.</p>
        <p>Cantor Fitzgerald and its supporters contend that the company suffered a uniquely devastating blow in the terrorist attack when 658 of its 960 employees at the trade center were killed. Mr. Lutnick has rebuilt the company and expects to double the size of its New York headquarters over the next two years.</p>
        <p>A year ago, Cantor was seeking to build a new headquarters in a former department store building 2.5 miles north of Wall Street in Union Square, but the deal fell through, and now the firm is looking downtown.</p>
        <p>''It's a great message for the rest of the world,'' Mr. Silver said yesterday. ''Downtown is back, alive and well.''</p>
        <p>The two sides are at odds over a city benefit known as the Relocation and Employment Assistance Program, or REAP, and Mr. Silver's proposed modifications, which would benefit Cantor. REAP was devised years ago to stem the flow of offices and jobs from Manhattan to less expensive office space in New Jersey or Connecticut. It provided companies with benefits worth $3,000 per employee for 12 years if they moved instead to Long Island City in Queens or downtown Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>But the program expired in June, much to the dismay of local development officials in Queens and Brooklyn, when the State Legislature failed to extend it. Since then, Mr. Silver, who controls the State Assembly, has blocked the city's efforts to reinstate REAP as the two sides argued over specific provisions. Recently, the Downtown Brooklyn Council sent a letter to Brooklyn legislators urging them to reauthorize the program quickly or risk losing more jobs to Jersey City.</p>
        <p>''Without REAP, it will be extremely difficult to compete with New Jersey, which has its own programs,'' said Michael Burke, executive director of the council.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver wants REAP to cover companies moving from Midtown to downtown, a change that would provide Cantor alone with at least $1.5 million a year in benefits for the next 12 years. Mr. Silver said the downtown economy remained severely wounded and now deserved the same protection and incentives as Queens and Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''In order to ensure that downtown remains a thriving commercial district, we're going to need more tools than the dwindling pot of federal money,'' said Kathryn Wylde, president of the New York City Partnership.</p>
        <p>But city and state officials say Mr. Silver's provision would cause a budget disaster by unnecessarily giving away tax revenues. Already, they say, there are millions of dollars in federal tax breaks and cash incentives for companies willing to move downtown or remain there.</p>
        <p>Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said that Mr. Silver's modification would trigger rent wars between downtown and uptown landlords at a time when, according to Newmark &amp; Company Real Estate, rents are already 29 percent cheaper on average in Lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''We shouldn't sacrifice the rents in Midtown out of a desire to fill empty space in Lower Manhattan,'' Mr. Spinola said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver also wants to make companies moving from downtown to Queens or Brooklyn ineligible for REAP benefits. Local development officials say that such companies are choosing between Jersey City and Brooklyn, not downtown and Brooklyn. But city officials appear willing to compromise with Mr. Silver by restricting the REAP benefits for companies moving outside Lower Manhattan.</p>
