        <p>BOB RABEY remembers that when the Courtesy Hotel in West Hempstead opened on Hempstead Avenue in the 1960's, it was a benefit to the community. But over the years, he said, it has become a magnet for drug dealers and prostitution.</p>
        <p>''As their business started to decline, they were forced to do business by any means necessary,'' said Mr. Rabey, the president of the West Hempstead Civic Association. ''They now advertise hourly room rates in New York City newspapers, which attract an undesirable element into the community. There have been prostitution and drug arrests there. It has a right to do business as a hotel, but not at the expense of an entire community.''</p>

        <p>BOB RABEY remembers that when the Courtesy Hotel in West Hempstead opened on Hempstead Avenue in the 1960's, it was a benefit to the community. But over the years, he said, it has become a magnet for drug dealers and prostitution.</p>
        <p>''As their business started to decline, they were forced to do business by any means necessary,'' said Mr. Rabey, the president of the West Hempstead Civic Association. ''They now advertise hourly room rates in New York City newspapers, which attract an undesirable element into the community. There have been prostitution and drug arrests there. It has a right to do business as a hotel, but not at the expense of an entire community.''</p>
        <p>At the urging of his organization -- and with the Courtesy Hotel in mind -- the Hempstead Town Board adopted a public nuisance ordinance in August 2000 that allows the town to shut down a business if the police make two arrests for drugs, prostitution or similar crimes in a one-year period.</p>
        <p>In April, the town invoked that law for the first time when it filed a complaint in State Supreme Court in Mineola, seeking to close the Courtesy Hotel. Kathleen P. Murray, the Hempstead town supervisor, said the town acted after arrests at the hotel for drug possession and the attempted sale of drugs on Jan. 2 and again on March 19.</p>
        <p>''We're committed completely to pursuing this as far as we have to in court,'' Ms. Murray said. She added that the hotel's lawyer recently submitted a response to the town's complaint, and now that the ''issue is joined, it will get assigned to a judge.''</p>
        <p>She credited the West Hempstead Civic Association with helping to pursue the matter, saying the group had been ''a great partner with the town.''</p>
        <p>''They are very perturbed about the hotel, as are other residents,'' Ms. Murray said.</p>
        <p>If the town succeeds in closing the hotel, Ms. Murray said it might seek to condemn the property and to have housing for the elderly built in its place, a move the civic group has endorsed.</p>
        <p>Dennis M. Lemke of Mineola, the hotel's lawyer, said his client planned to fight the town's efforts, arguing that cameras had been installed, along with other ''security measures to make this the safest hotel possible.''</p>
        <p>''Individuals and guests sign in when they rent a room,'' he said. ''If they have drugs on them or pick up a prostitute and come back to the hotel, we don't have any involvement with any of that. Any hotel is going to have such problems.''</p>
        <p>''It's like a rental car company renting a car to someone who uses it to commit a robbery,'' Mr. Lemke said. ''The rental company should not be charged with the robbery.''</p>
        <p>He said the hotel acts to ensure that there is no loitering in the parking lot and that it did not invite problem guests. ''Take a look at the individuals and the charges,'' Mr. Lemke said. ''There is nothing anyone can do to prevent it, and we're taking very step possible to avoid it. It's a shame what's going on. But if there is a situation where someone wants to rent a room for four hours for sex, it may be morally wrong, but there is nothing illegal about it.''</p>
        <p>Thomas McKevitt, the deputy town attorney in Hempstead, said that the hotel was warned in 2001 that the town might seek to shut it down after police made a drug arrest there that year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rabey said that although the town had been responsive to the civic association's complaints, he contends that West Hempstead would be better served if it had its own code enforcement inspectors.</p>
        <p>''We have about 16,000 people in West Hempstead,'' he said. ''We are an unincorporated area surrounded by incorporated areas that have their own police and code inspectors. We don't have the strict enforcement that incorporated areas have.''</p>
        <p>For West Hempstead to hire its own code enforcement officers, it would have to incorporate or set up its own community court system. But Mr. Rabey said incorporation would add $1,500 to $2,000 a year to each West Hempstead resident's tax bill. So the civic group is now speaking with officials in the Town of Babylon, which is in the process of creating a community court. Mr. Rabey said that fines levied by the court could pay for its operation and for the salaries of code enforcement officers.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Margiotta, the special prosecutor in the Town of Babylon, said that the State Legislature must approve the community court, which would be called an adjudication bureau, and that legislation would be submitted on Babylon's behalf in January.</p>
