        <p>CIAFFONE--Betty R., 55, of Coconut Grove, FL, died on October 10, 2003, of ovarian cancer. Betty is being cremated, and at her request, no formal services will be held. Betty is survived by her parents Charles P. and Rose Ciaffone of Palm City, FL; her brothers Charles and Nancy Ciaffone of Durham, NC, and Robert and Gloria Ciaffone of East Brookfield, MA; and five nieces and nephews. Throughout her successful career in international banking, Betty traveled extensively and lived in several countries. In each country she embraced the culture, and made lifelong friends through her exuberant personality and zest for life. A Betty R. Ciaffone Scholarship has been established by The Villagers, a South Florida historical preservation organization where Betty served on the Board and volunteered many hours. Donations may be sent to The Villagers, PO Box 141843, Coral Gables, FL 33134.</p>
