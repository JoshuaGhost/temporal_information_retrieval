        <p>Vivendi's Universal Music Group is expected to buy DreamWorks Records for about $100 million, people close to the company said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The proposed deal reflects the general turmoil in the record industry, analysts said, as a three-year sales slump has prompted merger talks among all the major labels. Warner Music, part of Time Warner, is in talks to sell a majority stake to either EMI Group or to a separate consortium of investors including Edgar Bronfman Jr., Haim Saban and Thomas H. Lee Partners, executives close to those talks said. And Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, has expressed interest in merging its music business with a partner, perhaps Sony's division.</p>

        <p>Vivendi's Universal Music Group is expected to buy DreamWorks Records for about $100 million, people close to the company said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The proposed deal reflects the general turmoil in the record industry, analysts said, as a three-year sales slump has prompted merger talks among all the major labels. Warner Music, part of Time Warner, is in talks to sell a majority stake to either EMI Group or to a separate consortium of investors including Edgar Bronfman Jr., Haim Saban and Thomas H. Lee Partners, executives close to those talks said. And Bertelsmann, the German media conglomerate, has expressed interest in merging its music business with a partner, perhaps Sony's division.</p>
        <p>The move may be a sign that Universal, which announced plans earlier this month to lay off more than 1,000 employees and was close to being sold by Vivendi earlier this year, thinks the worst is over. But analysts said DreamWorks Records, part of the larger DreamWorks entertainment company formed in 1994 by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, might also be coming at a particularly good price.</p>
        <p>The roster of DreamWorks, which is run by a longtime record industry executive, Mo Ostin, includes the country star Toby Keith and the pop singer Nelly Furtado. But the company, Mr. Geffen's first major music venture after selling his highly regarded Geffen Records label to MCA in 1990, never became a significant force in the music business.</p>
        <p>By proposing to fold DreamWorks into Vivendi's Interscope Geffen A&amp;M unit, run by Jimmy Iovine, the company expects it can benefit from an efficiency of scale by eliminating much of DreamWorks's overhead costs. The two companies already have a close relationship, with Universal's distribution arm distributing music for DreamWorks Records.</p>
