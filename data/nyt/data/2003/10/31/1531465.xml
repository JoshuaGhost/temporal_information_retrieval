        <p>Trailing in polls for the presidential elections in March, President Chen Shui-bian has stepped up his appeals to Taiwanese separatism but has drawn little reaction so far from Beijing.</p>
        <p>By calling for a national referendum on three touchy issues, to be followed by a redrafting of the Constitution starting in 2006, Mr. Chen appears to have narrowed somewhat the gap by which he trails a rival ticket that unites the fractious political opposition. But his own party's polls still show him behind by a bit, while polls by newspapers, most of which lean politically toward the opposition, have found him behind by as much as 15 points.</p>

        <p>Trailing in polls for the presidential elections in March, President Chen Shui-bian has stepped up his appeals to Taiwanese separatism but has drawn little reaction so far from Beijing.</p>
        <p>By calling for a national referendum on three touchy issues, to be followed by a redrafting of the Constitution starting in 2006, Mr. Chen appears to have narrowed somewhat the gap by which he trails a rival ticket that unites the fractious political opposition. But his own party's polls still show him behind by a bit, while polls by newspapers, most of which lean politically toward the opposition, have found him behind by as much as 15 points.</p>
        <p>China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since 1949, when the Communists prevailed on the mainland in China's civil war.</p>
        <p>In a written response in English on Thursday to questions submitted last week, Mr. Chen strongly emphasized Taiwan's sovereignty, but he did so without suggesting a substantive change in Taiwan's policy toward the mainland.</p>
        <p>''As an independent sovereign country, Taiwan does not belong to the People's Republic of China, nor is it a part of any other country,'' he said. He avoided saying directly that Taiwan was independent of the mainland, a phrasing that would upset officials in Beijing.</p>
        <p>While Chinese newspapers constantly criticize Taiwan, Chinese leaders have kept largely silent in the early stages of the campaign here. Previous attempts to intimidate Taiwan, most notably by firing missiles into its shipping lanes in 1996, have backfired by building support for Democratic Progressive Party politicians like Mr. Chen while hurting the opposition Nationalist Party, which favors an eventual political reunification.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen is to arrive in New York on Friday, where he will accept a human rights award.</p>
        <p>He has sometimes made headlines with subtle changes in his oratory that could be interpreted as a tilt toward a declaration of independence from the mainland. But senior Taiwanese officials said in interviews here this week that no such comments were likely in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen acknowledged the growing cooperation on diplomatic issues, although not economic issues, between Washington and Beijing.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. needs China's accommodation on the issues of antiterrorism and North Korea's nuclear weapons,'' he wrote. ''As long as the U.S. continues to support Taiwan and strengthen substantive relations with Taiwan during its exchanges with China, our government does not oppose improved relations between the U.S. and China.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen wants to hold a national referendum close to the March elections on nuclear power policy, the size of the legislature and Taiwan's efforts to join the World Health Organization. While none of these issues bears directly on Taiwanese separatism, holding a referendum at all could set a precedent on whether to amend the Constitution to include separatist provisions.</p>
