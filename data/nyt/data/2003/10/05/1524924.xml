        <p>DID you do your homework?</p>
        <p>If so, the Connecticut section would like to hear from you. Think back to the best homework assignment you ever had (or maybe the worst). The assignment could have come from an English teacher, a dance instructor, a bar mitzvah coach. Maybe you finished it five days ago; maybe you finished it 45 years ago. Why was it memorable? How did it improve your mind or your character?</p>
