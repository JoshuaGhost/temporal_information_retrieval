        <p>Updated edition of Bernard F Conners' book Tailspin: The Strange Case of Major Call offers some support for his theory that Maj James Call murdered Marilyn Sheppard in Cleveland suburb in 1954 from victim's son, Sam Reese Sheppard; photo (M)</p>

        <p>A half-century after the tale of a bludgeoned Cleveland housewife, her handsome doctor-husband and a ''bushy-haired'' stranger made its bid for trial of the century status, the story of Sam Sheppard still piques the public's curiosity.</p>
        <p>The whodunit -- was it Dr. Sheppard or a mysterious stranger? -- has spawned countless article, books, documentaries and movies, including ''The Fugitive,'' the television series and the movie that are said to be inspired by the case. Testimony to the mystery's staying power are two new additions to the Sheppard collection, which reach opposite conclusions about who beat Marilyn Sheppard to death on July 4, 1954, in her bedroom in an elite Cleveland suburb.</p>
        <p>One book, released earlier this year, is ''Dr. Sam Sheppard on Trial: the Prosecutors and the Marilyn Sheppard Murder'' by Jack P. DeSario and William D. Mason. Their book argues that Dr. Sheppard, who spent a decade in prison for the murder, only to be acquitted at a retrial,was guilty.</p>
        <p>But an updated edition of ''Tailspin: The Strange Case of Major Call'' by Bernard F. Conners, due out next month, asserts that that Maj. James Call, a washed-out Air Force officer who became a burglar, a convicted killer and a fugitive, broke into the Sheppards' home and killed Marilyn Sheppard. The book maintains that a bite mark on Major Call's hand and other forensic evidence indicate that he was the ''bushy-haired'' figure whom Dr. Sheppard always insisted had fled the murder scene. .</p>
        <p>Mr. Conners, a former F.B.I. agent, received support for his case through serendipity. The Sheppards' son, Sam Reese, who was 7 when his mother was killed, was thumbing through family photos a few months ago when he found a shot of his mother at a race track. She was seated next to a partially obscured man who he thought resembled the ex-military grifter Mr. Conners had said was the killer in the original ''Tailspin,'' which came out last year.</p>
        <p>Some longtime Sheppard watchers dismiss Mr. Conners' theory. Sam Reese Sheppard is not among them. He once thought that the family's window washer -- identified in a 2001 book called ''The Wrong Man'', by James Neff -- was the killer. Now he says Major Call may have done it. All he knows for sure, he said, is that ''my dad didn't do it.''</p>
