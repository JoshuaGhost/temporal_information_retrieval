        <p>James Houghton has resigned in a pique as the artistic director of the O'Neill Playwrights Conference, the country's leading workshop for new plays, saying he was excluded from the board's reorganization plans.</p>
        <p>The conference, based in Waterford, Conn., has nurtured the careers of playwrights like Edward Albee, John Guare and Lanford Wilson. In Manhattan Mr. Houghton is also the founding artistic director of the Signature Theater Company, which devotes entire seasons to the works of leading playwrights like Mr. Wilson.</p>
        <p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Houghton said his resignation was effective immediately. He recently learned from the center's new executive director, Amy Sullivan, that the board decided in August, without consulting him, to centralize artistic leadership of the conference's parent, the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center. The center has artistic directors overseeing its conferences, which range from puppetry to musical theater. Consolidating the leadership could affect the creative control of these artistic directors.</p>
        <p>His exclusion from the process was ''unacceptable,'' Mr. Houghton said, adding, ''It breaks the bonds of trust necessary with a board.''</p>
        <p>Tom Viertel, chairman of the O'Neill center, said that Mr. Houghton was told in July that the board was developing a long-term reorganization that might consolidate the O'Neill's artistic leadership. The decision to speed up the process was made about two weeks ago, Mr. Viertel said, and Mr. Houghton was informed as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>''He did a spectacular job,'' Mr. Viertel said. ''I'm sorry that we couldn't turn this into a friendly and orderly transition.''</p>
        <p>Had he been included in the board's decision, Mr. Houghton said, he would have fully supported efforts to deal with the center's financial burdens; it has a $600,000 debt.</p>
        <p>To save money, Mr. Houghton shortened the playwrights conference by one week last summer and, despite strong objections from writers, temporarily replaced the open-submissions process of selecting plays with a nomination system.</p>
