        <p>Regardless of how the World Series turns out, in the world of public opinion, the teams are dead even. Some fans are ''tired of seeing reruns'' while others consider the Yankees' success over the years as proof that ''they're the best.'' Then again, a lot of people would rather be watching football.</p>
        <p>A plurality of Americans do not have a preference on who wins the World Series and the rest are equally divided between the Yankees and the Florida Marlins, according to the latest CBS News Poll.</p>
        <p>The Marlins and the Yankees are each backed by 27 percent of the adults surveyed on Monday and Tuesday by CBS News. The poll was conducted by telephone with 751 adults nationwide and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points.</p>
        <p>There is slightly more interest in the outcome of this Series than the 2000 Series between the Yankees and the Mets. Then, a New York Times/CBS News poll found 58 percent uninterested in the outcome. This year, 45 percent of the public does not care who wins.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the Yankees are the favorite in their own region. The Yankees are No. 1 among 43 percent of people living in the Northeast, while only 19 percent are rooting for the Marlins.</p>
        <p>Fans are more closely divided in the rest of the country, including the South, where the Marlins are preferred by 28 percent and the Yankees by 23 percent. In the Midwest and the West, fans are similarly divided, with the Marlins getting the edge. In Tucson, Ray Lopez is rooting for the Marlins. ''I don't like the New York Yankees,'' he said. ''I never have.'' Lopez, 62, was reinterviewed after the poll was completed.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Cindy Castoro, who lives in Tequesta, Fla., plans to celebrate her 38th birthday today by going to the World Series and cheering for the Yankees. ''I'm from Oklahoma,'' said Castoro, whose husband is a Yankees fan originally from Brooklyn. ''I don't have any professional teams from the state I grew up in, and I adopted the Yankees.''</p>
        <p>Lucille McAllister, 79, of Richmond, Va., a former New Yorker who cheered for the Brooklyn Dodgers, is hoping for a Marlins victory. ''I just think that the Yankees have won enough,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The percentage of people indifferent to which team walks away with the trophy is higher. ''I don't care for either one of those teams,'' said Brent Sorenson, 54, of Oak City, Utah. ''I would have liked to have seen Boston or Chicago.</p>
        <p>''I don't really pay attention to baseball. I watch football.''</p>
        <p>In fact, according to a recent Gallup poll, half of all American adults do not follow baseball at all. The Gallup poll, conducted for CNN and USA Today after the playoffs were completed and before the Series started, found only 42 percent of the 1,002 adults interviewed by telephone considered themselves fans of professional baseball, with another 8 percent who said they were ''somewhat of a fan.''</p>
