        <p>One season after Chad Pennington helped jump-start the Jets' offense, Jacksonville's rookie quarterback, Byron Leftwich -- like Pennington, a Marshall alumnus -- is trying to duplicate the feat with the Jaguars.</p>
        <p>In his second N.F.L. start last Sunday, Leftwich passed for 336 yards against the San Diego Chargers, the most passing yards by a rookie since Nov. 29, 1998, when Peyton Manning of the Indianapolis Colts threw for 357 yards against the Baltimore Ravens. Leftwich, who has 567 passing yards in his first two starts, needs 305 passing yards against Miami on Sunday for the most passing yards in a rookie quarterback's first three starts.</p>
