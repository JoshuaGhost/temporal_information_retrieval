        <p>The horror movie set in a crumbling haunted mansion was already enough of a cliché for James Whale to make fun of it in his wonderful ''Old Dark House'' of 1932, but the director Terry M.

        <p>The horror movie set in a crumbling haunted mansion was already enough of a cliché for James Whale to make fun of it in his wonderful ''Old Dark House'' of 1932, but the director Terry M. West goes surprisingly far in freshening the shopworn formula with ''Flesh for the Beast,'' a shocker set in a New England mansion once owned by a notorious turn-of-the-century Satanist.</p>
        <p>Shot on video, ''Flesh for the Beast'' adopts the format of Robert Wise's film ''The Haunting'' (1963): a group of paranormal researchers are invited to spend the night in a rambling old Victorian pile, known to be one of the hottest spots for paranormal activity on the East Coast. Among the group is Erin Cooper (Jane Scarlett), a prim, virginal young woman who is a gifted medium. While the male members of the team, wandering off down dank corridors, encounter vicious, scantily clad female spirits who seduce and then slaughter them, Erin remains on the trail of the building's ghostly original owner, the sinister, sadistic Alfred Fischer, played by the veteran Italian heavy Aldo Sanbrell.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanbrell's presence is a clue, if any were needed, to the truest sources of ''Flesh for the Beast'': the grisly Italian horror films of the 1970's and 80's, and in particular those directed by Lucio Fulci, like ''Gates of Hell'' (1980) and ''The House by the Cemetery'' (1981). Fulci's trademark was his use of gore -- extreme often to the point of absurdity, as in the scene from ''Gates of Hell,'' lovingly recreated here, in which a woman vomits up her entire digestive system.</p>
        <p>Mr. West is too self-conscious about what he is doing -- though his self-consciousness never turns to campy condescension -- to capture the first-degree thrills of a naïf like Fulci. Material that seemed to spring straight from the Italian filmmaker's subconscious seems somewhat studied and academic here, as if it were set off by quotation marks. Still, fans of the genre -- or ''gore hounds'' as they are known in fandom -- will find plenty to enjoy in Mr. West's enthusiastic approach to his work.</p>
        <p>''Flesh for the Beast'' opens today at the new Videotheater NYC (85 East Fourth Street, East Village).</p>
