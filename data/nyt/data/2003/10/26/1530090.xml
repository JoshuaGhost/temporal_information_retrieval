        <p>WE are gliding along the banks of a river deep in the wilds of the Peruvian Amazon, when the Indian guide at the bow of our wooden canoe suddenly shouts ''Capybara!'' Three furry mounds proceed to rise up and glare at us through eyes eerily placed on the tops of their heads.</p>
        <p>Our Indian boatman, who still hunts with a bow, had only contempt for the gigantic rodents, though we had drifted so close to them we could see their sad teddy bear mouths and the flies buzzing around their whiskers. ''They eat grass,'' he spat. ''They have a stinky taste.''</p>
        <p>A century ago, a deadly hail of arrows would have greeted us instead of these bizarre snouted creatures, shot by the ancestors of the very Indians who are now guiding us up this jungle tributary. They are members of the Ese Eja-Sonene tribe, once the fiercest of warriors, who massacred missionaries, loggers, and any other white men who ventured into their territory.</p>
        <p>Now, although they are still one of the most primitive tribes in the Amazon basin, the Ese Eja, backed by eco-tourist organizations, have recently built and opened a very comfortable jungle lodge in the Manu Wilderness on the border between southeastern Peru and Bolivia. Nestling into crisp sheets and handmade quilts while snakes and parrots held forth in the trees above us, my son, Josh, and I stayed here for four days of a 10-day trip into the region last January.</p>
        <p>We canoe to a macaw clay lick in the cool of the morning, the sweet aroma of cane and fig mixed with the sharpness of mud marsh coming off the river, which is silted a caramel brown. Concealed in a floating thatched catamaran, we watch the brilliant red-and green-birds squawk and soar down onto a cliff to bite off hunks of clay, which serve to detoxify their systems. Two macaws are beak to beak, as though kissing, another tickles a friend's neck, a third pair spread their glorious wings like Chinese fans. They fight over perching holes, bend backward and dangle from vines, and generally entertain us with their acrobatics. Blue-headed parrots and peach-fronted parakeets join in. As they groom each other and flirt with potential mates, it's clear this isn't just a spa for birds -- it's a party mixer of sorts.</p>
        <p>We are in the rainy season, but the rainfalls are brief and we hike through glistening virgin rain forest. It also brings out legions of army ants, protecting their queen by creating a ball of ants around her, and endless twisting trails of leaf-cutter ants, carrying bits of leaves to their enormous home mounds. When we almost stumble over a colony of bullet ants, so called because their sting feels like a bullet wound, I run, but Josh, 18 years old, crouches to study them. He also boldly shakes a symbiotic ant tree; when the tree is threatened, the stinging ants come out from inside and will jump on the attacker. That night, however, his affinity for ants comes back to bite him, so to speak. The Indians had arranged for us to camp out in the forest for a night and after we had crawled into our tents, several yelps came from Josh's. He fled into my tent while I sprayed his ant-infested one with my conveniently packed can of Raid.</p>
        <p>We had really wanted to rough it, but the Indians created a campsite reminiscent of ''Out of Africa,'' complete with hot meals brought from the lodge, and a portable toilet and shower. The Ese Eja Lodge (aka Heath Wildlife Center) was spacious and, though there were candles instead of electric lights, had such amenities as complete bathrooms. It was in stark contrast to the Indian village a mile away, where generations of a family crowded into bare straw huts and wore cheap half-shredded western clothes. Nonprofit organizations had recently turned the lodge over to the poverty-stricken Indians to try to help them survive as one of the few tribes in Peru that still have their own language and culture.</p>
        <p>Thus men who ate loin of monkey sliced with a machete found themselves learning where to put spoons in a table setting and women who had never slept in anything but a hammock were trying to master hospital corners. The lodge had only been open six months, but bookings for the dry season were coming in, and with the help of outside advisers, things were running smoothly.</p>
        <p>The advisers had also helped these indigenous people rediscover some of their native crafts, and we watched a woman with a toddler sucking at her breast weave a fan from grass she had cut; she had just learned how to do this but her hands flew, as though some ancient memory had been reawakened. Most of the men were out working in the manioc fields, but some lounged about, cleaning their nails with their machetes.</p>
        <p>The medicine man, Gregorio, and his friends took us through the forest to show us its medicinal marvels and to demonstrate how his people harvested brazil nuts, their main industry. The trees had dropped what looked like cannonballs on the forest floor; each contained a cluster of about a dozen raw brazil nuts. A local man named Eddie delicately shaved the shells off the nuts with the ever-useful machete, which sliced within a millimeter of his fingers. The clean white unroasted nuts were crunchy and delicious, tasting slightly of coconut.</p>
        <p>Gregorio took us through enormous strangler figs, lopped off a liana and opened his mouth and drizzled water into it -- the vine contained about a liter of water. He showed us a ''malaria bush,'' which contains the quinine used to make the medicine that fights malaria. He rubbed the moist pulp from the bark of one tree on a cut on my hand, and to my surprise it had closed up by the next day. He found a lemony leaf for headache, and another to help with the heartache caused by lost love. The guide accompanying us told us that while the young people usually went to the government health clinic, the older folk swore by Gregorio.</p>
        <p>We then trekked to the hut of Gregorio's father, the old village shaman, who lives by the river, where naked children played in mud that sucked them in up to their waists. We passed two pet white capuchin monkeys that spit viciously at Josh but cooed lovingly at me. The shaman, a wrinkled character in brown polyester pants and boots with no laces, chanted his stories in a thin crackly voice. He once exorcised evil spirits from afflicted villagers, but now he has only the occasional visitor. His wife brings out the long woven striped robe he used to wear, now full of holes. Family and friends surround him, toddlers crawl on his bony knees, as he waves his arms and tells of how he recently treated one young man with a persistent pain in his belly. He had blown pipe smoke over him to release his own good spirits; then he squeezed his stomach and plucked out a piece of bamboo, which he said was the evil spirit making the man sick.</p>
        <p>''There was no wound before or after the bamboo came out of the man's stomach,'' Gregorio said. Everyone nodded. ''There were 12 of us saw it. No wound. It was an evil spirit. And from then on, the man has been well.''</p>
        <p>After four days we said goodbye to the Ese Eja and traveled for four hours to the remote Sandoval Lake region, also in the southern Peruvian Amazon. It was only attainable by taking a series of canoes and then hiking several miles on muddy trails. But the lake was spectacularly beautiful and the Sandoval Lodge rather pleasantly rustic with narrow rooms open at the top so that one could hear the chatter, and the ablutions, of people on either side. It rained more frequently here and our clothes, damp and moldy, were spread out on every surface, our tall rubber boots in constant use. The dimly lighted lodge served such traditional fare as cornmeal steamed in cornhusks and provided free wooden catamarans with boatmen to cruise the edges of the lake looking for wildlife.</p>
        <p>That night we went caiman hunting, shining flashlights until we saw a pair of suspended red eyes and then a large gnarly gator diving under the water. For the next few days we saw a cornucopia of birds -- striated and great white herons, anhingas, cormorants, green Amazon kingfishers and yellowbellied social flycatchers. Our Peruvian guide did an amazing array of bird calls and he was as often as not answered by the birds, especially the undulating tinamou. Our favorite bird was the ancient hoaxin, which looked like a turkey but had huge, beautiful turquoise and caramel-colored wings, a ridiculous topknot of feathers, and a fierce, staring expression.</p>
        <p>Most thrilling, however, was finding the monkeys, usually at dusk. We got within a few yards of some brown capuchins that were making impossible leaps from palm tree to palm tree in order to drink the water on the leaves. On the last day we happened upon a group of young squirrel monkeys playing in a big patch of vines connecting some trees, popping up and then disappearing. When at last they noticed us, they stopped and stared with their round protruding ears and black masks. Then they began to clap and slap each other on the back, tossing back their heads and making loud screeches. It took us awhile but we finally realized that they were laughing at the very sight of us.</p>
        <p>Canoe trips and rickshaw rides</p>
        <p>Getting There</p>
        <p>Our trip was arranged by an eco-tourism agency in Lima, InkaNatura, which owns both lodges where we stayed, and it worked through ProTravel International, (212) 755-4550, www.protravelinc.com and PanAmerican Travel, (800) 364-4359, www.panam-tours.com. The agency provided a private Peruvian nature guide for $100 a day. Although the guide was most helpful, we found this was not entirely necessary because both lodges also provided guides who accompanied us. The agencies together charged a fee of 15 percent of the trip's costs, including air fare..</p>
        <p>We took a Lan Chile overnight flight from New York to Lima ($640 a person round trip), then a Lan Peru flight to the southeastern city of Cuzco. After three days exploring the ancient city and its ruins, and visiting nearby Machu Picchu, we took a short Lan Peru flight to the Amazonian port of Puerto Maldonado. All round-trip flights within Peru were a total of $278 a person under a special off-season package deal.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>In Cuzco, we stayed at the Libertador Hotel, an old centrally located and well-appointed hotel with 254 rooms at Plazoleta Santo Domingo 259, (51-84) 231-961, fax (51-84) 233-152, www.libertador.com.pe. It cost $641 a person for three nights, including breakfast.</p>
        <p>We then made a four-and-a-half-hour motorized canoe trip up the Madre de Dios and Heath Rivers to the Ese Eja Lodge, www.inkanatura.com or through InkaNatura, Calle Plateros 361, Cuzco, (51-84) 251-173. The lodge has six bungalows. We spent $490 a person for three nights, including meals and the boat transfer. The bungalows are comfortable, screened, open-sided cabins with shower and hot water, surrounding a rustic but spacious main quarters decorated with Indian beadwork. The lodge has several hiking trails.</p>
        <p>Ese Eja is often combined with a trip to the 25-room Sandoval Lake Lodge, whose contact is also InkaNatura, in the neighboring Tambopata National Reserve. To reach it, we took another long boat ride, a short trip in small paddled canoes, and a 45-minute hike (or the lodge will transport you by rickshaw) through muddy trails. The rooms at this remote lodge are small but the hot-water shower in each is unusually sumptuous. The rates are $195 a person for three nights including meals.</p>

        <p>Correction:  November 9, 2003, Sunday  An article on Oct. 26 about the Peruvian Amazon misstated the name and location of a lodge in which the author stayed. It is the Heath River Wildlife Center, not the Heath Wildlife Center; Ese Eja Lodge is its former name. It is in the Tambopata-Madidi Wilderness, not the Manu Wilderness.</p>
        <p>The article also misspelled the name of one bird and misidentified another. The first was a hoatzin, not hoaxin. The one referred to as a great white heron was misidentified; the habitat of that species does not include Peru. Ornithologists say the bird was probably a great egret or a white-necked heron; their appearance is similar.</p>
        <p>A capsule guide with the article misidentified the owners of the lodges in which the author stayed. The Heath River Wildlife Center is owned by the Sonene community of the Ese Eja ethnic group, and the Sandoval Lake Lodge is owned by Peru Verde, a nonprofit conservation group, with local families. Neither lodge is owned by InkaNatura Travel.</p>
        <p>The guide also misstated the easiest way to make a reservation at the lodges. Tropical Nature Travel, (877)827-8350, www.tropicalnaturetravel.com, is a direct source in the United States. InkaNatura is its Peruvian branch.</p>
