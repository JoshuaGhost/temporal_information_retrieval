        <p>Reporters from Malaysia and Japan did not attend his first preseason game, nor has he been afforded divine (Chosen One) or royal (King James) status. But Denver's Carmelo Anthony is quickly showing that some of the spotlight being focused on Cleveland's LeBron James should be turned west.</p>
        <p>While James struggled in the preseason, lofting a few air balls while making just 34 percent of his shots, Anthony treated some top-flight opponents like Big East competition.</p>
        <p>Against stalwart defenders like Phoenix's Shawn Marion, Indiana's Ron Artest and Toronto's Michael Curry, as well as the Portland Trail Blazers and the Detroit Pistons, Anthony averaged a team-best 17.4 points while shooting 48 percent from the floor to lead Denver to a 5-3 record. ''He's done it against some very athletic, tenacious defenders,'' Nuggets Coach Jeff Bzdelik said last week in a telephone interview. ''So let's hope it continues. I'm sure it will.''</p>
        <p>There seems to be little reason to think it will not. Anthony, the third pick in the 2003 draft behind James and Detroit's Darko Milicic, has demonstrated the ability to score in several ways. He hits jumpers, sinks midrange shots off the dribble, takes the ball strong to the basket and scores off post-ups. And perhaps most surprisingly, he has spent plenty of time at the free-throw line.</p>
        <p>Adept at drawing contact, Anthony averaged six free-throw attempts while playing only 29 minutes a game. Against Toronto, he attempted eight free throws in the first quarter alone. He made 78 percent of his attempts.</p>
        <p>''He has a great knack for getting fouled,'' Bzdelik said. ''He knows how to draw contact both in the post and on the drive. He's very deceptive in his moves and he's instinctive and explosive with the ball.''</p>
        <p>Anthony's best performance came -- where else? -- at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, where 20,315 fans turned out to see Denver play Detroit last Sunday. The Pistons won, 93-91, but Anthony, who as a freshman led Syracuse to its first national title last season, did not disappoint. Attempting 13 free throws in 34 minutes, he scored a preseason-high 23 points, including 19 in the first half.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't play like a rookie,'' Bzdelik said. ''He has shown a great maturity about the pro game.''</p>
        <p>Anthony, who averaged 4.4 rebounds, encountered only one rough spot, scoring just 6 points in a 102-79 loss at Houston last Wednesday. It was the only game in which he failed to score in double figures.</p>
        <p>James, a good friend, has hit plenty of rough spots, including an 8-point, 4-for-18 performance in which he fouled out on national television against the Lakers. James's most glaring deficiency was a poor jump shot, but he showed improvement over the final three preseason games, averaging 16.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 5 assists. James had preseason highs of 19 points and 8 assists last Wednesday in a victory over Washington.</p>
        <p>A recent survey conducted by NBA.com revealed that 81 percent of the league's general managers expect James to win the rookie of the year award, but the television analysts Charles Barkley, Steve Kerr and Doug Collins picked Anthony.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if he's going to be a better player, but he's more advanced at this stage,'' Barkley said in comparing Anthony with James during a conference call last week.</p>
        <p>''LeBron might turn out to be the next great player, but right now, Carmelo is a better shooter, a better scorer, and he's played against better competition. He's more prepared right now to play in the N.B.A.''</p>
        <p>The nation will not have to wait long for a matchup between the rookies, who are bound to be linked throughout their careers. Cleveland will be host to Denver in a game televised by ESPN on Nov. 5.</p>
        <p>Caution About McGrady's Back</p>
        <p>Orlando's Tracy McGrady played through back problems last season, and back spasms kept him out of two games last summer for the United States national team. He missed two preseason games because of a sore hip, but he is currently at full strength. Still, Coach Doc Rivers, who has watched injury turn Grant Hill into a spectator, had sobering words regarding McGrady's health.</p>
        <p>''I think he's in the best possible situation, but the problem is it's the back,'' Rivers said in a recent conference call. ''The back ended my career. I had it going in as a rookie, and it never really let up. Everyone who has a back injury knows what I'm talking about. It's never going to heal.</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is what you have to do is make it functional so you can play at your normal speed all the time, and that's where he's at right now.''</p>
        <p>High Praise for Bulls' Hinrich</p>
        <p>The Chicago Bulls lost one prized point guard, Jay Williams, to a motorcycle accident but still have two young playmakers with grand potential. The 6-foot-5 Jamal Crawford, 23, who beat out the highly touted Williams last season, is expected to blossom. And Coach Bill Cartwright has compared Crawford's backup, the rookie Kirk Hinrich, to a future Hall of Famer.</p>
        <p>''Kirk's had a terrific preseason thus far,'' Cartwright said in a recent conference call. ''He's been excellent during our practice sessions. When we first got him, I didn't know how good this kid was, but after seeing him -- and I hate to say this -- this kid has all the qualities of a young John Stockton. He's tough, smart. He's just a true point guard, and we're very excited and pleased with him.''</p>
        <p>Francis Nothing Like Van Gundy</p>
        <p>Houston Coach Jeff Van Gundy, a former point guard, was asked recently if he wanted Steve Francis to become an extension of him on the floor. ''I would say that Steve Francis and I, playing-wise, have nothing in common,'' said Van Gundy, who averaged 8.8 points and 4.6 assists over three seasons at SUNY-Brockport and Nazareth in Rochester. ''He's good, and I wasn't.''</p>
