        <p>Dr James S Kemp of St Louis University School of Medicine reports in journal Pediatrics that according to data collected by federal Consumer Product Safety Commission number of deaths among sleeping children 11 months and younger rose from 513 reported between 1980 and 1983 to 883 from 1995 to 1998; increase, however, was not in crib death, which actually declined; substantial increase occurred in deaths in beds, chairs or sofas, primarily when children became trapped or air supply cut off by soft bedding; study finds babies were 40 times as likely to suffocate in beds as in cribs; drawing (S)</p>

        <p>The number of infants who suffocated while sleeping in adult beds, sofas or chairs rose sharply between the 1980's and 1990's, even as suffocation in cribs became rarer, a study released yesterday found.</p>
        <p>The risk of suffocation outside of cribs was highest for children in their first month of life, according to the study, which was published in the journal Pediatrics.</p>
        <p>The study's senior author, Dr. James S. Kemp of the St. Louis University School of Medicine, called the results worrisome, particularly in light of other surveys that have found more parents taking children into their own beds in recent years.</p>
        <p>The study drew on data collected by the federal Consumer Products Safety Commission about suffocation deaths in sleeping children 11 months old or younger and compared the figures for 1980 to 1983 with those from 1995 to 1998.</p>
        <p>The number of deaths rose from 513 to 883. Deaths in beds, chairs or sofas rose from 152 to 391, and deaths in cribs fell from 192 to 107, the study found. Most deaths outside cribs occurred when children became trapped between mattresses and walls or headboards or when the children were covered by soft bedding that cut off their air supply.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kemp and his colleagues also estimated the relative risk of beds and cribs by comparing data gathered in a broad national survey with the consumer agency's mortality reports. They calculated that babies were 40 times as likely to suffocate in beds as in cribs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kemp acknowledged that some of the increase could reflect changes in patterns of reporting such deaths, but that a number of factors suggested that the newer numbers were more accurate.</p>
