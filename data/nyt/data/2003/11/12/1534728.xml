        <p>After agreeing to drop a provision requiring many military contracts to go to American companies, Congress is on the verge of passing a record authorization bill to let the Pentagon spend more than $400 billion for the next year.</p>
        <p>The bill, approved by the House last week and scheduled to be passed by the Senate as early as Wednesday, resolves a host of issues that have divided Republicans on military-related committees, like a multibillion-dollar lease of tanker jets from Boeing and a program to pay other countries to destroy chemical and nuclear weapons.</p>
        <p>A main issue was the insistence of House Republicans that many costly contracts go primarily to American suppliers. The Bush administration and several American allies strongly opposed that provision, which would have affected many purchases for military operations in Iraq. Senate Republicans succeeded in removing it in a conference committee. The provision now encourages contractors to use American-made equipment, but does not require it.</p>
        <p>''It's a balanced compromise which shows our support for a strong U.S. industrial base without undermining our important defense-cooperation relationships with our allies,'' said Senator John W. Warner, the Virginia Republican who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warner fought to preserve the administration's ability to contract with foreign companies.</p>
        <p>The Senate also restored the full $451 million that the administration requested for a program to destroy nuclear and chemical weapons abroad, for the first time extending the program beyond the countries of the former Soviet Union. The House had proposed cutting $29 million from the chemical weapons section.</p>
        <p>Senator Richard G. Lugar, the Indiana Republican who is an original sponsor of the program, said it began in 1991 to reduce unconventional weapons in the Soviet Union, but had never extended beyond those areas.</p>
        <p>''The president has sought the authority to prevent the intersection of terrorists with weapons of mass destruction,'' Mr. Lugar said, citing the $50 million in the bill that could be used to help any foreign government destroy weapons at Washington's discretion. ''In trying to fight a worldwide battle against terrorism, that authority is obviously needed.''</p>
        <p>The bill includes a 4.1 percent average pay increase for all uniformed military personnel. But the bill has drawn criticism from civilian employees for a provision that would let officials bypass traditional Civil Service rules in granting increases and promotions in favor of a performance-based system. Moderate Republicans who have traditionally fought such changes agreed to the administration's demand after winning provisions for appeals through unions, similar to accords struck in forming the Homeland Security Department.</p>
