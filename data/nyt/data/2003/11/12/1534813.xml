        <p>Police arrested a man last night and charged him with second-degree murder in the shooting death of his mother-in-law in her Queens home on Monday afternoon. Olga Prince, 71, died from a single gunshot wound to the head. The police discovered the body at the entrance to her kitchen with a handgun lying beside her, and charged Sydney Sampson, 54.
