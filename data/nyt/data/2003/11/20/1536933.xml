        <p>Congress is about to send President Bush a bill creating the National Nanotechnology Coordination Office and authorizing the appropriation of $3.7 billion over the four years starting next October for nanotechnology research and development. The legislation, which Mr. Bush is expected to sign, converts an investment initiative originally established by President Bill Clinton into a continuing arm of the government. It requires the office to undergo triennial performance reviews by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences. The first such review would also include a study of whether it is feasible to create nanoscale devices that can assemble themselves or copies of themselves molecule by molecule -- a subject of fierce debate among nanotechnology experts.</p>
