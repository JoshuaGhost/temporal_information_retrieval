        <p>Shirley Hazzard, who twice before was a finalist for the National Book Award for fiction, won the award last night for ''The Great Fire'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), a love story set in devastated post-World War II Japan and her first novel in 23 years.</p>

        <p>Shirley Hazzard, who twice before was a finalist for the National Book Award for fiction, won the award last night for ''The Great Fire'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), a love story set in devastated post-World War II Japan and her first novel in 23 years.</p>
        <p>She accepted the award before a crowd of 900 writers, editors and publishers, and urged American writers to remain aware of their immense power in the world and their consequent responsibility not to degrade the language they had been given.</p>
        <p>''We're drowning in explanations,'' she said. ''What we need is more questions.''</p>
        <p>The four winners, each of whom received $10,000, were chosen from among 1,030 authors, the highest number of entrants in the awards' 54-year history.</p>
        <p>The winner for nonfiction was Carlos Eire, whose book ''Waiting for Snow in Havana: Confessions of a Cuban Boy'' (Free Press/Simon &amp; Schuster), evokes pre-revolutionary Cuba and Mr. Eire's eccentric father, a municipal judge who believed that in a past life he was King Louis XVI. Mr. Eire, a professor of history and religion at Yale who left Cuba at the age of 11, pointed out that if he had written such a frank and truthful book in his native land, ''I would be in prison.''</p>
        <p>The poetry award went to C. K. Williams for ''The Singing'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), a collection that deals with aging and memory. The judges said that Mr. Williams, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1999, effortlessly negotiated ''the terrain between the eternal and the topical'' and that his poems were ''forged from the elegiac material of a mature life.''</p>
        <p>Polly Horvath won the Young People's Literature Award for ''The Canning Season'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux), about a little girl named Ratchet Clark who is shipped off to live in Maine with her 91-year-old twin aunts.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the evening, the National Book Foundation presented the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters to Stephen King. Some writers and editors have criticized the choice, a reaction that Mr. King acknowledged in accepting the award. He spoke of two camps in publishing, those who believe popular and literary fiction can be wedded and those who do not.</p>
        <p>''You know who you are and where you stand,'' Mr. King said, ''and most of you here tonight are on my side.''</p>
