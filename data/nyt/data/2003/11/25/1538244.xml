        <p>After a long wait, new rules that allow people to change mobile phone companies while keeping their numbers sent a surge of customers into cellphone stores around the country yesterday, with some stores seeing more than a tripling of traffic.</p>
        <p>Some customers arrived just after dawn. They had marked this day on the calendar, and there was no reason to wait for the first coffee break. As the doors of America's cellphone stores opened, they were ready to go.</p>
        <p>''The sooner the better,'' said Bryan Lamb, 27, a property manager in San Francisco, explaining why he showed up yesterday morning at Verizon Wireless's downtown store to abandon his three-year relationship with Sprint PCS.</p>
        <p>''The sooner I get a new provider, the sooner I can get on with my life.''</p>
        <p>It is a sign of the times that a federal telecommunications regulation could lead to so much rejoicing. At stores across the country, people eager for the change had hopes of putting behind them bad reception, disconnected calls, high bills and poor customer service.</p>
        <p>The companies declined to say how many people switched services yesterday, and several cited Securities and Exchange Commission rules that prohibit them from divulging materially significant financial information before the end of the quarter. But evidence of strong consumer interest in switching providers could be seen in many cities.</p>
        <p>Verizon Wireless said that store traffic was twice to four times normal. T-Mobile reported that some of its more than 700 stores had a ''significant'' increase in activity, and said the number of calls to its phone lines were up 400 percent.</p>
        <p>Sprint had more customers at its stores, but, like the other carriers, said that it expected the big surge to come Friday, generally considered one of the biggest shopping days of the year.</p>
        <p>Many customers, however, had no intention of waiting.</p>
        <p>''Help. I need to get rid of my AT&amp;T phone,'' said Steve McNulty, as he walked into a Cingular store in San Francisco in the morning.</p>
        <p>The manager of a downtown investment firm, Mr. McNulty, 40, had been an AT&amp;T Wireless customer for 10 years. He said that he had learned to live with at least one drawback. ''I couldn't send or receive calls from home or work,'' he said, explaining that the reception just wouldn't work. ''Other than that, it was great.''</p>
        <p>But changing carriers was not instantaneous, or free. He had to pay around $300 for two new phones -- one for him and one for his wife -- though he will receive rebates so that his final cost will be about $38.</p>
        <p>Because of the computer system used to switch phone numbers back and forth, Mr. McNulty had to leave his phones at the Cingular store to make sure that his old number was successfully transferred. A salesman told Mr. NcNulty the transfer could take as little as 30 minutes. Mr. McNulty, who was in a hurry, plans to pick the phones up Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Although for the most part, the number transfers went relatively smoothly, carriers, sales representatives at retail stores and customers faced some technical frustrations.</p>
        <p>For instance, at one point, Verizon had trouble getting numbers transferred from AT&amp;T Wireless, said John Stratton, head of marketing for Verizon Wireless. He also said that Verizon briefly had trouble moving some of its numbers to Sprint PCS.</p>
        <p>''There were carrier breakdowns at different points,'' Mr. Stratton said. ''But generally, everybody performed at an equal level.''</p>
        <p>Sales representatives at several stores said they were just learning the computer system. Some said the automated number-transfer function did not work at times, forcing them to enter information manually into the computer, a time-consuming task. Still, some customers did not seem to mind the potential wait.</p>
        <p>At the Sprint store on 42nd Street in Manhattan, a salesman told Mike McNulty that it could take up to five days for him to get calls made to his old phone number on his new phone.</p>
        <p>''I don't care,'' said Mr. McNulty, 30, who works in insurance sales in New York, asserting it was worth the wait. It was not so much that service was terrible with T-Mobile, his old mobile carrier, he said, but his girl-friend had Sprint service and it was better.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day, it was unclear which companies had gained customers and which had lost them. Because the carriers could only see their own activity, they said they could not put together a full picture of how number portability was affecting the competitive landscape.</p>
        <p>Several industry analysts have predicted that the loss of subscribers to some of the six major carriers -- Nextel, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T Wireless, Sprint PCS and Cingular Wireless -- could turn the weaker providers into acquisition targets now that customers can more easily vote with their feet.</p>
        <p>Doug Lhotka, a 36-year-old system architect in Denver, said he bounded into the Verizon Wireless store at 8:30 a.m. because he was so eager to leave AT&amp;T Wireless.</p>
        <p>''About two months ago AT&amp;T turned off all cellphones for a day and then had their customer service closed for five days,'' he said. ''I've been waiting for six months to do this.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lhotka said he was not necessarily saving any money by switching -- he chose a calling plan very similar to his earlier one. ''It's the same deal, but I expect to get better coverage, and price was not a factor in my decision,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He was not put off by the need to buy a new phone either because he plans to sell the old one. ''I read that so many people are going to switch back and forth there's going to be a market for phones on eBay,'' he said. ''If I get $20 for the old phone, that's beer money to me.''</p>
        <p>And with that, he started the walk back to his downtown office.</p>
