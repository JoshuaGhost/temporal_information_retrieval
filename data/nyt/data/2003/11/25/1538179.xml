        <p>Editorial supports US decision not to push for crackdown and to allow International Atomic Energy Agency to test how far Iran is willing to go on cooperating with inspectors; says it would be foolish to undercut pragmatists within Iran who are struggling with hard-liners</p>

        <p>The board of the International Atomic Energy Agency failed to agree last week on how best to deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Britain, France and Germany favored a diplomatic approach that would encourage Iran to cooperate with the agency's inspectors while the United States pushed for a crackdown through the United Nations Security Council. Wisely, Washington has now backed down and will let the I.A.E.A. test how far Iran is willing to go. There is a struggle in Iran between those who want to cooperate with inspectors and hard-liners who seek a nuclear capability. It would be foolish to undercut the pragmatists.</p>
        <p>Iran has long been suspected of nuclear weapons ambitions, but it came as a shock to learn in recent months that it has been pursuing a clandestine nuclear program for almost two decades. Thanks to tips from Iranian opposition groups, sharp sleuthing by I.A.E.A. inspectors and increasing pressure from Western powers, Iran was finally forced to admit that it had been pursuing both uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technologies, at a level of sophistication no one dreamed possible. The Iranians contended, implausibly, that these programs were designed for civilian nuclear fuel, but surely there would be no need to conceal and lie about them if they were truly benign. Some experts think Iran could make a bomb in a couple of years if it pressed ahead vigorously.</p>

        <p>Iran has long been suspected of nuclear weapons ambitions, but it came as a shock to learn in recent months that it has been pursuing a clandestine nuclear program for almost two decades. Thanks to tips from Iranian opposition groups, sharp sleuthing by I.A.E.A. inspectors and increasing pressure from Western powers, Iran was finally forced to admit that it had been pursuing both uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing technologies, at a level of sophistication no one dreamed possible. The Iranians contended, implausibly, that these programs were designed for civilian nuclear fuel, but surely there would be no need to conceal and lie about them if they were truly benign. Some experts think Iran could make a bomb in a couple of years if it pressed ahead vigorously.</p>
        <p>The three European powers achieved a breakthrough last month when Iran agreed to suspend its enrichment program, sign a protocol allowing tougher international inspections and resolve all questions raised by the I.A.E.A. Now the same three nations are supporting a resolution before the agency's board of governors that would chastise the Iranians for their past misdeeds but would focus on their recent change of attitude as a way to move forward with additional fact-finding and inspections. The United States, which had been pushing for referral to the Security Council, a path that could lead to economic sanctions, agreed yesterday to back off and let the allies' resolution prevail.</p>
        <p>The only clear imperative is that Iran must be pressed to reveal all its nuclear activities, past and present, and cooperate wholeheartedly with international inspectors. That can best be done by allowing the I.A.E.A. to continue demanding answers. When the agency's board reconvenes tomorrow, it should pass a resolution condemning Iran's secret programs and demanding that Iran prove that its programs are peaceful. The resolution should include a trigger mechanism to force international action if Iran reverts to stonewalling or deception.</p>
