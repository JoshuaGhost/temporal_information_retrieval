        <p>It was after midnight yesterday on the night of the fall's first freeze when Officer James Phillips found his quarry: Deniro Rhumble, 2 years old, asleep in a parking lot behind the Park Lake Housing Development in Hempstead, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The boy was eight miles and 10 hours from where his mother had last seen him on Saturday afternoon, when a thief stole her car from a street in Laurelton, Queens, after she left the engine running while she picked up takeout Caribbean food.</p>
        <p>Officer Phillips, who is assigned to the 105th Precinct by the New York Police Department, said there was no sign that Deniro, who had no injury other than very cold toes, had been moved from his car seat in the back of the gold Nissan Maxima in all that time.</p>
        <p>The car's hood was cold. 'It had been stopped for a couple of hours,'' Officer Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Deniro's disappearance prompted an Amber Alert, a police dragnet and a teary, pleading appearance by his mother on the evening news. As they waited hour after hour with their son taken by a criminal, Deniro's parents were taunted by the fact that twice, people answered calls to the cellphone that had been left in the car, but said they knew nothing about a child.</p>
        <p>''My greatest fear was for the morning to come,'' said Barrington Rhumble, the child's father. ''If I had to wait until the morning, I would probably have lost the child.''</p>
        <p>As he spoke yesterday, Deniro, named for his father's favorite actor, played happily with a soccer ball and offered the house a round of Nilla Wafers. His father watched football on a large-screen television and his mother did dishes.</p>
        <p>His abductor, who the police believe did not realize that he was acquiring a toddler as well as a vehicle, remained at large. Forensic investigators searched the car for clues.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Queens district attorney said endangerment charges against Deniro's mother, Judith Alveranga, 27, had not been ruled out. In 1997, a Danish woman and a Brooklyn man were arrested when they left their baby in a stroller on the sidewalk while they had a drink inside a Manhattan restaurant, near the window. The baby was unharmed and the charges were dismissed in court.</p>
        <p>Ms. Alveranga, who said she was a check-in agent at La Guardia Airport, and Mr. Rhumble, who said he worked at a record store in Newburgh, N.Y., defended her actions. They likened the situation to leaving a car to pay for gas before returning to the pump, and said she had left the engine running so the car would stay warm. ''Every mother has done that,'' Ms. Alveranga said.</p>
        <p>She said she had left the car twice: first, when her friend told her that the food she wanted was not on the menu, and second, when she went inside to hand some money to her friend. The car was double-parked directly in front of the restaurant and Deniro was asleep in the back seat.</p>
        <p>It was her friend, she said, who spotted a heavy-set black man wearing black clothes and a black skullcap approaching the car.</p>
        <p>''As I went in, she said, 'Judith, Judith, somebody's getting in your car,'' Ms. Alveranga said.</p>
        <p>The police began a block-by-block search for the Maxima. Officer Phillips, 24, who joined the force 14 months ago, said that the fact that the car was last seen heading east on Merrick Boulevard led authorities to Nassau County. But later, Mr. Rhumble said that it was the cellphone.</p>
        <p>No one answered local calls on the phone, so the couple had Ms. Alveranga's sister call from Florida. The first time, they said, a woman answered and promised to return the phone. The second time, a man answered and said he had found the phone at a McDonald's in Freeport, N.Y., a few miles from Hempstead. He promised to take it to the nearest precinct, they said. Detectives went to the McDonald's but found nothing.</p>
        <p>Later in the evening, the phone was used several times, the couple said, allowing investigators to narrow the search to Hempstead.</p>
        <p>As the ordeal continued, Ms. Alveranga appeared in front of news cameras, begging for the thief to abandon the car and call 911. Officer Phillips teamed up with two Nassau County officers, under orders to look for a gold Maxima with Florida plates. But he said they stopped every Maxima they saw. ''It's not that hard to change a license plate on a car,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Park Lake parking lot is well lighted and heavily traveled because it provides the easiest route to a nearby store. Yesterday, one resident who refused to give his name said that he believed he had walked past the car twice between 8 and 9 p.m. on Saturday.</p>
        <p>It was after midnight when Officer Phillips spotted the Maxima. Another officer read off the plate number. ''There's actually the one,'' Officer Phillips thought to himself, he said yesterday. ''There it is.''</p>
        <p>The doors and windows were shut. And there, in the back seat, was the curly-haired boy wearing a yellow sweatshirt and a blue cap. Officer Phillips opened the driver's side door and unlocked the rest of the car. A Nassau County officer reached in and lifted Deniro from the car seat. An ambulance was already on its way.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhumble was waiting at the 105th Precinct station house, and Ms. Alveranga was at home with a detective when the news came: the car had been found, and the child was alive. They rushed to the hospital, where Ms. Alveranga, arriving first, found Deniro in a nurse's arms. ''I didn't stop crying,'' she said. ''It was just joy after so many hours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rhumble agreed. ''Not even one million dollars can get that feeling to get back your child,'' he said.</p>
