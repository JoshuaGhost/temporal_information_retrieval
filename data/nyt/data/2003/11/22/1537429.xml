        <p>STEINHARDT--Jack Leon, on November 19, 2003. A man who knew an ecdysiast from an amanuensis. Decorated for his service in the ETO under General Patton in the 118 SRI Co. Whose love for broadcasting continued in radio stations in the South and Mid-Atlantic. Whose encyclopedic knowledge of movies and theater and passion for words never ceased to delight his wife of 53 years Anne, his daughter Thami, his son Avi and daughter-in-law Diane, or those who enjoyed the crossword puzzles he created for the New York Times. His grandchildren Miles, Shaylyn and Aaron will miss a kind, gentle, loving soul. As will all those who were part of his family, were his friends and who had the pleasure to work with or serve with him.</p>
