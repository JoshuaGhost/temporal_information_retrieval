        <p>ROTHSTEIN:  The Life, Times and Murderof the Criminal GeniusWho Fixed the 1919 World Series  By David Pietrusza  Carroll &amp; Graf  ($27, hardcover)</p>
        <p>He did much of his fixing at Lindy's Restaurant in Times Square, spending so much time there that many thought he owned the place. Abe Scher, Lindy's night cashier, was used to seeing Rothstein at Lindy's and was familiar with his habits and desires. ''Mr. Rothstein comes in,'' Scher recalled:</p>
        <p>Every night he comes here. Regular as clockwork, he comes here. Sunday night, Monday night, any night. Everybody knows that. Like always, there are some people waiting for him. They are waiting near his table, the same one where he is always sitting. . . .</p>
        <p>This place, it is like an office for him. People come in and they are leaving messages for him. All day and night, they are telephoning for him here. It ain't that Mr. Lindy likes the idea, but what can he do? An important man like Mr. Rothstein, you do not offend. ... Some fellows, they go to his table and they are talking confidential to him. You know, they are talking into his ear. . . . Did he give anyone money? . . . Who knows? Mr. Rothstein you see, but you do not watch. . . . Is there a time when he is not having his little black book?</p>
        <p>The Speakeasies of 1932  By Al Hirschfeld  Text by Gordon Kahnand Al Hirschfeld  Glenn Young Books  ($32.95, hardcover)</p>
        <p>Once known as John and Andy's, but the personality of Julius, the former barkeeper, invoked the present gigantic following. The present incumbent is Tommy, who is young and a smart hand with the rubber socking-hose and bare fists when the occasion calls for some expert slugging. Which is often.</p>
        <p>Four times padlocked, Julius's is (at this writing) back on its original Waverly Place corner in Greenwich Village (159 West 10th Street), for Villagers almost exclusively. Sensible citizens betray themselves by ordering anything else but beer. The strong waters are 50 cents with no guarantee that they will reach your face.</p>
