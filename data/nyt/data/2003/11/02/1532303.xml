        <p>The immensely successful Matrix trilogy, written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, comes to a climax this Wednesday with the release of the final chapter, ''The Matrix Revolutions.'' It's been just a few months since part two, ''The Matrix Reloaded,'' took in some $281 million at the domestic box office, making it the third-highest grossing film of 2003. With the passionate interest fans bring to the Wachowskis' blend of philosophical speculation (the premise: we're all really living in an artificial environment, generated by evil computers) and slam-bang, high-tech action, the concluding installment stands to take in even more.</p>
