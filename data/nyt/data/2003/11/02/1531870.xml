        <p>BLOODY SUNDAYS</p>
        <p>Inside the Dazzling, Rough-and-Tumble World of the N.F.L.</p>
        <p>By Mike Freeman.</p>
        <p>Morrow, $24.95.</p>
        <p>Although pro football can make a legitimate claim to be our national sport, it seems to lose its hold on fans when the television set is switched off; there are more incisive books about golf than pro football. In ''Bloody Sundays,'' Mike Freeman, a sports reporter for The Times, gives you so much to think about that you might find yourself switching off a game to read. He describes a football factory owned by Wilson in Ada, Ohio, population 5,582 (where N.F.L. balls ''are handmade by people named Peggy, Charlie and Aunt Maudie''), provides a revealing portrait of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' coach, Jon Gruden, and includes a startling interview with an unnamed gay player who claims that 5 percent to 10 percent of N.F.L. players are homosexual. The statistics in Bloody Sundays are the kind that won't be quoted by John Madden: the divorce rate of N.F.L. coaches is about 70 percent in the last two decades, the average career of a running back is 2.57 years, most defensive ends last just 3.31 seasons. At the heart of ''Bloody Sundays,'' though, is Freeman's passionate belief that the violence and ugliness of the game are redeemed by the spirit and resilience of players like Emmitt Smith, Michael Strahan and Jerry Rice, who ''used a combination of athleticism, precision and work ethic better than almost any athlete in any sport.''</p>
