        <p>Almost every sector of life in Baghdad was off kilter on Saturday, usually a normal business day here, because of anonymous warnings that hospitals, schools and other unspecified sites would be the targets of bombings.</p>
        <p>Residents kept their children home from school. The United States military kept most soldiers in their barracks, and shopkeepers complained that they had no business.</p>
        <p>After one of the worst weeks of violence here in months, L. Paul Bremer III, the special representative for Iraq, said the American strategy for quelling the attacks was to ''encourage Iraqis to play a central role'' in securing the nation.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a news conference on Saturday evening, Mr. Bremer said the United States and Britain would double the size of Iraqi defense forces in the next year, bringing the number to 200,000 by September.</p>
        <p>The American military said a roadside bombing in Mosul on Saturday had killed two United States soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division and wounded two others. Witnesses also said an oil pipeline was on fire about 10 miles north of Saddam Hussein's hometown, Tikrit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bremer and Lt. Gen. Ricardo S. Sanchez, the top American commander in Iraq, contended that the threats and attacks against occupying forces were being carried out by ''elements of Saddam Hussein's forces,'' as Mr. Bremer put it, and by foreign fighters who have slipped into the country. ''There is a flow of foreign fighters, but I don't want to overstate it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The White House has argued that foreign terrorists are active in Iraq, and is trying to demonstrate that, officials said, to support the notion that the American forces are engaged in the global campaign against terrorism.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bremer said, ''It's not a large number.'' He said fighters from Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Sudan had been captured or killed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bremer acknowledged that children had stayed away from school on Saturday because of the bomb threats. ''But there was no general strike,'' he added. ''And business was active as usual.''</p>
        <p>Some Baghdad business owners might have quarreled with that. Across the city, people said they were either frightened or defiant because of the threats.</p>
        <p>As two sisters, Jehan and Zahra Kader, strolled with their mother down a central Baghdad shopping street on Saturday, few other shoppers were around, and traffic on the street was unusually light.</p>
        <p>''I work at a bank but didn't got to work today because I was afraid,'' said Jehan Kader, who is 27. Her 21-year-old sister added: ''I am a college student, but I didn't go to school today. I don't think they held classes.''</p>
        <p>Imad Qassam, secretary to the general manager of Al Kindy, a large public hospital, said that many people were not showing up for their appointments, and that fewer people than usual were visiting patients. ''I think all civil institutions are being targeted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Among the few patients at the hospital, some were determined not to be cowed by the threats. ''We don't care about such rumors; we don't fear such things,'' said Suad Jomma, who was waiting with her pregnant daughter for a doctor's appointment.</p>
        <p>But at Lubnan Elementary School, only 150 of the school's 550 students showed up for class on Saturday morning. ''I blame the satellite news channels,'' said Majeda Fadher, the principal. ''They spread such rumors.''</p>
        <p>Still, the first thing she and some of her students did Saturday morning was install a makeshift vehicle barrier in front of the school: a few rocks and sticks, an automobile wheel rim and an empty gas can. Across Baghdad in recent days, homeowners, business people and public employees have laid similar crude vehicle barriers haphazardly across dozens of streets.</p>
        <p>''It's a psychological war with the terrorists,'' Ms. Fadher said. ''God willing, everyone will come back tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, at Komet Middle School, the halls and classrooms were empty. About 1,200 children are enrolled in the school, but on Saturday morning only 25 showed up, said a teacher who was waiting for a ride home. Those who came were sent home.</p>
        <p>At an appliance store a few blocks away, Haider al-Saadi sat alone in his shop. ''People are hesitant to buy now,'' he said. ''Normally on a Saturday we sell 50 pieces. But so far today we have sold just one or two. Nobody is coming in.''</p>
        <p>''As the Baathists used to say,'' he added, ''today is a black day.''</p>
