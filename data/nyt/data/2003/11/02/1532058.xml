        <p>It has all the touches of a rural general store: friendly butchers, chatty cashiers and an old man who keeps customers smiling. For nearly 50 years, Charlie Pastor has run University Food Market (it started as a deli) at 115th Street and Broadway in Morningside Heights.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Mr. Pastor closed out his cash registers for the last time, and gave the keys to new owners. ''It's time to move on,'' Mr. Pastor, who is 72, said earlier last week. ''This is an end of an era, at least for me.''</p>

        <p>It has all the touches of a rural general store: friendly butchers, chatty cashiers and an old man who keeps customers smiling. For nearly 50 years, Charlie Pastor has run University Food Market (it started as a deli) at 115th Street and Broadway in Morningside Heights.</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Mr. Pastor closed out his cash registers for the last time, and gave the keys to new owners. ''It's time to move on,'' Mr. Pastor, who is 72, said earlier last week. ''This is an end of an era, at least for me.''</p>
        <p>Some shoppers, though, are not sure whether they will return. A neighborhood institution, they say, has been replaced by a cookie-cutter chain.</p>
        <p>The market opened in 1982, replacing a corner deli called Takome that Mr. Pastor also operated. Little about the store in those years has change, except maybe the faces of students from Columbia University, which owns the property.</p>
        <p>The new owners, Morton Williams Associated Supermarkets, a Bronx-based company that owns 9 supermarkets in the city and is part of a cooperative of 140, plans to modernize the store with brighter lighting and new refrigerators. The store will also be renamed Morton Williams University Supermarket.</p>
        <p>Some residents are already grumbling about the change.</p>
        <p>''Their stores all look the same,'' said Betsy Phipard, a writer who is a frequent University Food Market customer. ''I've known some of these people for 25 years. On any given day, they had three or four kinds of wild fish that were cut to order. I was told the new owners were going to have packaged fish.''</p>
        <p>In addition to reduced selection, shoppers in this civic-minded community are concerned about reduced wages. Morton Sloan, who now owns the supermarket with his brother, William, did not confirm the drop in wages but added that about 80 percent of the 50 current employees would remain. ''Some people will be making more,'' he said. ''Some will be making less.''</p>
        <p>But many workers are nervous. ''I currently make $10.35 an hour,'' said Rita Espinosa, a cashier of 16 years. ''They are offering me $7.50. A lot of people are leaving.''</p>
        <p>Neighborhood activists are already considering a picket or boycott.</p>
        <p>''The typical condo here sells for $1 million,'' said Edward Kent, a local resident who teaches at Brooklyn College. ''Marginally higher prices are not something we would be worried about. But we would be worried about the staff; $7.50 is not a living wage standard, particularly if you're a single parent.''</p>
        <p>Morton Sloan defended his business practices. ''There are two schools of thought,'' he said. ''One is to get rid of all the people. The other, which we have sort of adopted, says that if there are good people there, try to keep them. I think we are being more than fair. We understand the community. But we haven't had an opportunity to show who we are.''</p>
