      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>FOR the 21st-century boxed set, music isn't always enough. It's a multimedia music business now, and as video-era bands amass box-worthy archives, DVD's with video clips are beginning to take their place alongside hits, outtakes, rarities and live cuts. Here, the pop music critics of The New York Times review this year's boxed sets of three discs or more that include previously unreleased material. Sets that have already been reviewed in The Times, including Led Zeppelin's ''How the West Was Won'' and Miles Davis's ''In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk Complete,'' are not included. Prices are suggested retail.</p>
        <p>'MOSAIC SELECT: BENNIE GREEN' -- (Mosaic, three CD's, $39) A trombonist from Chicago, Green came up through the famous early-40's edition of the Earl Hines band, which included the primary architects of bebop, Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. He went on to play with Charlie Ventura and Duke Ellington, but always as a trombonist in a big band, until he began making these charming records under his own name in the late 50's and early 60's. Green's style wasn't bebop, though: it suggested a throwback to the swing trombonists Trummy Young and J. C. Higginbotham -- rhythmically clear and unhurried, with a slight New Orleans shout around the edges. Surrounding him were some of the great hard-bop players of the day (including Sonny Clark, Elvin Jones and Charlie Rouse), and the intersection of cool and hot styles makes these five records, little heard and long out of print, priceless.</p>
