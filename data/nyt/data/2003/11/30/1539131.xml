        <p>In Seussland, Rhyme Without Reason, You See, Sir, Is Treason</p>
        <p>The only doctorate he had was an honorary one, bestowed by the public, for humor. Still, Dr. Seuss had an inimitable bedside manner. ''Biography: Dr. Seuss'' (tonight at 8 on A&amp;E) looks at the world of Theodor Seuss Geisel and his stories, which have sold more than 200 million copies worldwide and have inspired films like the forthcoming ''Cat in the Hat.''</p>
        <p>Following the Children</p>
        <p>These days, a diagnosis of H.I.V. isn't necessarily a death sentence. That's the message Linda Ellerbee (above with Timmy, a South African orphan) delivers in ''The Courage to Live: Kids, South Africa and AIDS,'' on ''Nick News'' (tomorrow at 9 p.m. on Nickelodeon). In the World AIDS Day special, Ms. Ellerbee talks with a 15-year-old girl who is one of the longest-living South Africans born with H.I.V., and visits a home for orphaned children living with AIDS, to listen to their stories.</p>
        <p>Sometimes Clothes Make the Claus</p>
        <p>When a thief on the lam dons a Santa Claus suit and boards the first bus out of Chicago, little does he know he'll be taken at face value. In ''Stealing Christmas''(tonight at 8 on USA), starring Tony Danza and, from front left, Angela Goethals, Betty White and Lea Thompson, said thief arrives in the town of Evergreen, where a Christmas tree farmer and her rebellious teenage daughter mistake him for the Santa they've hired to promote their business.</p>
        <p>Going the Extra Mile in Someone Else's Race</p>
        <p>Tyler (near right) and Trevor are typical 18-year-olds. Tyler plays football and golf. Trevor plays basketball and likes to work out. The difference: Tyler was born H.I.V. positive and has to monitor his health closely. In ''A Walk in Your Shoes: Living With H.I.V./AIDS'' (tomorrow at 9:30 p.m. on Noggin)Trevor hangs out with Tyler and his friend Hydeia, who has full-blown AIDS, and learns the truth about the disease, and the people living with it.</p>
        <p>A Friend in Deed</p>
        <p>More than five million people in South Africa have contracted the AIDS virus -- a fact addressed this week in ''Scout's Safari'' (Saturday at noon on NBC), a Discovery Kids series that follows 13-year-old Scout Lauer (Anastasia Baranova) as she moves from the concrete jungle of New York to the South African grasslands. In ''Live to Play,'' one of Scout's friends, revealing he is H.I.V. positive, starts living for more than the next soccer game.</p>
        <p>Trounced by an Angel</p>
        <p>Hank McAllister, a firefighter, wants to slip in and out of town quietly. But then a photograph of him wrapping an American flag around a shivering dog appears in a local newspaper as the Face of Christmas. That's when Kathleen (Valerie Bertinelli), a nurse, comes to believe that Hank is her long-lost brother, and an angel named Max (Peter Falk) intervenes in ''Finding John Christmas'' (tonight at 9 on CBS).</p>
