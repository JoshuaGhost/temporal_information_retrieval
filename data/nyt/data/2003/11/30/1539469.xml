        <p>THE week before Thanksgiving, about 20 Hispanic women gathered in a church basement here to celebrate the holiday early with a potluck lunch -- not of turkey, but of rice, chicken, empanadas and tamales. At gatherings like this one, these women, most of them immigrants who are unemployed, get together to learn the basics of everyday life in their new land and to share their stories of need, as well as their strategies for the balancing act that is their lives: making do for their families on their husbands' paychecks, typically the wages of a laborer, with perhaps a small supplement of a few dollars a week from the wives.</p>
        <p>In the same week, in Mount Vernon, 93-year-old Rose Hacker boarded a van for adult day care. Mrs. Hacker, too, is needy, but in a different way: the six hours she spends at the day-care center provides a respite for her full-time aide and is key to keeping her at home rather than in a nursing home.</p>
        <p>On the same day, in Yonkers, Carla Timberlake, a 35-year-old single mother of two, was working at the after-school program at a church, where she is paid $10 an hour for her 20 hours a week. Mrs. Timberlake, who has been on public assistance for years, has undeniable needs as well: when she started her job, in September, she fought to retain part of the public assistance that she lost as a result.</p>
        <p>In Westchester County, the average income is more than $60,000 a year, and the median home price is pushing $600,000. But amid the good fortune, a wealth of need exists. The need comes in all colors, ages and ethnic origins, and in its growth and its changing character, that need reflects new realities in the county.</p>
        <p>''The face of neediness in Westchester is changing,'' said Theresa Kump, a spokeswoman with Family Services of Westchester.</p>
        <p>Among the needy, most commonly mentioned are three groups. Westchester has one of the fastest-growing elderly populations in the country, with one out of every five residents over the age of 60, and more than a third of them living on less than $25,000 a year, according to county figures. At the same time, an influx of immigrants, primarily Hispanics, is presenting new challenges for aid organizations. A third substantial group, according to officials of aid organizations, is the working poor, who are becoming, as one put it, the ''working ultrapoor.''</p>
        <p>The numbers of needy are also growing, with a startling rise from 1990 to 2000. One measure is the level of poverty. The number of people living in poverty in the county jumped to 78,967 in 2000, nearly 9 percent of the population, from 58,164 in 1990, which was 7 percent of the population, according to county figures. This represented a 36 percent increase in one decade, according to census figures provided by the county. In 1980, the number of people below the poverty level was 59,896, about 7.1 percent of the population, and in 1970 it was 54,498 people, or 6.1 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, said the biggest issue from the county's point of view is older residents. Care for the elderly is increasingly expensive, he said, and the county is forced to bear more and more of the burden. Also, the baby boom is just starting to age, meaning the worst is yet to come, he said. ''Our biggest challenge is going to be with seniors,'' he said. ''The senior population is growing and living longer. They need services.''</p>
        <p>Yet as a group, the elderly who need help are hard to define because they often live alone and are uncomfortable asking for help. The elderly may not live below the poverty level, but they still have needs that must be met.</p>
        <p>''They're almost an invisible part of the population,'' Ms. Kump said.</p>
        <p>Often, she said, something complicated happens: for example, an older person will have to make a choice between paying the rent or buying medication. As a result, he might stop taking medicine in order to save money and end up in the hospital.</p>
        <p>Frank Bentivegna, 72, and his wife, Claire, 71, of Yonkers, know what it is like to make such choices. Mr. Bentivegna has a history of heart and prostate problems, and his wife is a disabled diabetic whose health issues have required everything from heart and spinal surgery to a hip replacement.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bentivegna qualifies for long-term care and Medicaid, but the couple's $1,200 a month retirement income does not allow Mr. Bentivegna to receive benefits that would help pay for the nine medicines he takes daily. Recently, when his prescriptions outstripped his earnings, the Westchester Family Services' Sunshine Fund provided $340 to help bridge the gap.</p>
        <p>''We don't want to lose out and not be able to pay our electric bill, which is skyrocketing,'' Mr. Bentivegna said.</p>
        <p>Between 1960 and 2000, the county's over-65 population grew to 128,964 from 74,828, according to county figures. The over-65 group now makes up 14 percent of the county's population. By 2020, that group is expected to increase by 30 percent as a result of the aging of the baby boom. The fastest-growing segment of the county's population is those over 85, which increased 24 percent between 1990 and 2000.</p>
        <p>''The numbers are really in a way kind of scary because we're not ready for this,'' said Susan Wayne, vice president of services with Family Services of Westchester. ''We don't have enough assisted-living facilities. We don't have enough home health-care services, especially for what they're expecting to occur when we reach 2020.''</p>
        <p>MAE CARPENTER, commissioner for the county's Department of Senior Programs and Services, said older people tend to stay in the county in their later years. Some go to Florida, for example, and then return. That means returning at a time when they may be most in need of services.</p>
        <p>In addition, Ms. Carpenter said she hears stories from elderly people who are still helping their children to get their feet on the ground. ''One senior citizen 80 years told me she and her husband were still helping their children pay off education loans,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She said that many of the county's elderly are middle-class citizens who sold their homes, downsized and invested, only to find their investments reduced when the bottom fell out of the stock market.</p>
        <p>''Over 37,000 senior households had less than the income needed to afford median rent,'' she said.</p>
        <p>There are waiting lists of up to 10 years for federally sponsored housing for older people, Ms. Carpenter said, as well as waiting lists for the home-services program.</p>
        <p>This year, the county has received 114,000 requests for county services available for the elderly, more than four times as many over the 1998 figure. The services being sought range from home care to housing programs to transportation and utility payment assistance. There has also been a sharp increase in the number of older people taking part in quality-of-life programs. Some 17,000 people, 10 times as many from five years ago, have signed up for county programs providing health information, exercise sessions and medication management.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Carpenter said her budget to meet these needs has not increased accordingly. To make up the difference, her department is focusing on cost cutting and a variety of government and private partnerships to serve the growing population.</p>
        <p>Outside groups like Family Services of Westchester are also helping to take up the slack by offering increased services, many of which are focused on keeping the elderly out of nursing homes, which is increasingly expensive.</p>
        <p>Patricia Sperber, who is 66 and uses a wheelchair, is doing her best to stay in her own apartment in Ossining. But it's a continuing challenge as she battles a variety of health issues from osteoporosis to emphysema.</p>
        <p>She has home health care, which helps her to remain at home, but the issues are constant. For example, recently forced to use a wheelchair, she was having trouble maneuvering it down the hallway of her home because of the narrowness of the hall. On limited funds, she knew that making alterations was impossible.</p>
        <p>But she found help through the Sunshine Fund, which is the brainchild of Stanley Schear at Family Services of Westchester, which paid the $975 to modify the hallway.</p>
        <p>As officials address issues related to the elderly population, resources are also being stretched by an increasing population of immigrants, many of them Hispanic. Between 1970 and 2000, the number of Hispanics in the county grew to 111,309 from 23,359, the population increasing more than 67 percent between 1990 and 2000, according to county figures. The new arrivals, some undocumented and often speaking little or no English, need to try to make a new life for themselves. When they find work, it may be in low-paying laborer positions, with little job security.</p>
        <p>Arriving in a county where housing prices are among the highest in the state, recent immigrants are almost certain to have difficulty making ends meet.</p>
        <p>Martha Lopez-Hanratty, program administrator for Hispanic Affairs Westchester County, said that while the number of Hispanics living in Westchester is about 144,000, according to county figures, the true number is almost certainly higher because many newcomers and undocumented immigrants are uncounted. The county figures show that Hispanics are about 16 percent of the total population, but she estimates they may make up as much as 25 percent of the total population. Language, education, work and housing are the needs that are at the top of most immigrants' lists of needs. But the needs may also involve mental-health issues that come from families being split between countries, and depression resulting from the isolation of being a new immigrant.</p>
        <p>At Latino Connections, a program for Hispanic women in Port Chester, the women gather every Friday and receive a wide range of information, from tips on how to be better parents to nutrition to domestic violence. They make crafts and provide support for one another.</p>
        <p>Only a few of the women speak English, and most are looking for work, but language creates a barrier.</p>
        <p>Lelea Barajas, whose children are 15, 13, 4 and 2, lives on whatever her husband makes a week working as a roofer or painter. When the income is steady, it is enough to pay the $1,350 a month rent on their two-bedroom Port Chester apartment and cover other expenses. But in bad weather or when work is slow, she must rely on the money she has put aside for such occasions and hope it stretches far enough -- or come up with a stopgap solution such as selling the tamales that she makes in her own kitchen.</p>
        <p>Although she would like to work, her command of English is limited and jobs are hard to find. She has taken English classes, but, she says, at 35, ''it's too hard to learn.''</p>
        <p>Sandra Garcia, who runs the program out of the Summerfield Church basement, says it is difficult to understand why so many Hispanic immigrants continue to arrive in Port Chester, particularly since the rents are very expensive. Often, she said, families end up living two to a one-room apartment.</p>
        <p>She said she has been working with two families that recently arrived in the area.</p>
        <p>''It's hard for them to find a job,'' she said. ''When they do, the salaries are nothing.''</p>
        <p>Traditionally, cities in the southern part of the county have been home to many of those in need. In the 1950's and 60's, Yonkers, with Mulford Gardens, a housing project dating to 1939, saw its poor population -- predominantly African-American -- grow along with those in New Rochelle and Mount Vernon.</p>
        <p>Irwin Stein, a co-founder of Family Services of Westchester in 1954 and its sole caseworker initially, said the greatest needs in the county at that time were housing and adequate income.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, the homeless took center stage as housing prices increased and rentals became less available. Social workers said they began to see more women heading households and drugs playing a significant role in creating need later in the decade.</p>
        <p>Poverty continues to grow. Those on the front lines say they are seeing greater numbers seeking assistance, including more immigrants and more working poor.</p>
        <p>Rosa Boone, who heads the Coalition for the Hungry and Homeless, said among those standing in the soup lines this year are people who lost their jobs as a result of the economic downturn and the ripples from the September 2001 terrorist attacks, including one family that used to be a benefactor to her program.</p>
        <p>At Hope Community Services, a service organization with a food pantry and soup kitchen in New Rochelle, Anne Carey-Colorado, the director, said some clients are homeless in the traditional sense living at the train station or in the park, she is seeing more families sharing spaces in a garage or a basement because they can no longer afford the rents. She said the pantry has registered 400 new families this year.</p>
        <p>While poverty is still most prevalent in cities in the lower part of the county, it is expanding in notable pockets around Peekskill, Ossining and Port Chester.</p>
        <p>''What I see in our neighborhood is not so much homeless, not so much people sleeping on the street,'' said the Rev. Debra Avery, minister at Good Shepherd Presbyterian Church in Yonkers. ''What we have is the working ultrapoor. It's gone beyond the working poor.'' As for the welfare-to-work program, she said, ''it isn't working all that well here.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Timberlake works in Good Shepherd's after-school program, and she might agree with that assessment. Just a month into her $10-an-hour, 20-hour-a-week job, she lost many of her public-assistance benefits. She is now fighting to get them back.</p>
        <p>''We're not starving and we're not dirt poor,'' she said. ''It's just that sometimes I can't make ends meet.''</p>
