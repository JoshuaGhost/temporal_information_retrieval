        <p>FOR the 21st-century boxed set, music isn't always enough. It's a multimedia music business now, and as video-era bands amass box-worthy archives, DVD's with video clips are beginning to take their place alongside hits, outtakes, rarities and live cuts. Here, the pop music critics of The New York Times review this year's boxed sets of three discs or more that include previously unreleased material. Sets that have already been reviewed in The Times, including Led Zeppelin's ''How the West Was Won'' and Miles Davis's ''In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk Complete,'' are not included. Prices are suggested retail.</p>
        <p>BJORK: 'LIVEBOX' -- (One Little Indian, four CD's and one DVD, $58.98) Bjork can command the attention of a rock festival audience without deviating from her avant-garde vision -- a talent that has induced twinges of envy in many onlooking musicians. These chronologically arranged live CD's testify to her songwriting, performing and arranging brilliance, particularly the discs from her later ''Homogenic'' and ''Vespertine'' tours. Though the five-song DVD seems perfunctory at first glance, it offers helpful visuals like Bjork singing ''Aurora'' while backed by an Inuit choir, Zeena Parkins on harp and MC Schmidt of Matmos providing percussion by walking in a box of rock salt. But for those new to Bjork's music, it's better to start with her DVD ''Volumen''; for dedicated fans, more than half of this material is available elsewhere.</p>
