        <p>Occupying forces here have no immediate plans to use private Iraqi militias to augment the Iraqi Army and police force, senior American and Iraqi officials said Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The United States wants to expand Iraqi security forces as quickly as possible to relieve the burden on the 150,000 American and other foreign troops in Iraq.</p>
        <p>But a proposal to augment state-trained troops with paramilitary forces affiliated with Kurdish and Shiite political parties is only in the embryonic stages, according to members of the Iraqi Governing Council and Dan Senor, a senior adviser to L. Paul Bremer III, the chief administrator of Iraq.</p>
        <p>''Ambassador Bremer has always had concerns about this proposal,'' Mr. Senor said. He denied that Mr. Bremer had decided to ''conditionally support'' the idea, as was reported Wednesday by The Washington Post. ''The concerns remain.''</p>
        <p>Two members of the Governing Council said paramilitary forces should not be used as part of the army or police force. ''That's off the table,'' said Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a who represents Shiite Muslims. ''No one will entertain that.''</p>
        <p>In the short run, using militias might be the quickest and easiest way to improve order on Iraq's streets and uproot the terrorists and guerrillas who routinely attack American troops and civilian targets. On Tuesday, Jalal Talabani, a Kurd who holds the council's rotating presidency this month, wrote a letter to President Bush asking that the United States transfer more authority to Iraqis.</p>
        <p>But occupying authorities worry that the militias could become power centers competing with whatever new government Iraqis form. In addition, the militias have not been trained for policing and may be prone to use force inappropriately.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Bremer and Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the top military officer in Iraq, have said they would not allow paramilitary forces.</p>
        <p>Mr. Senor acknowledged that while Mr. Bremer had not agreed to support paramilitary forces, he was now open to talking about the idea. ''All we are saying is if there's a way to address those concerns, we're open to discussing them,'' Mr. Senor said.</p>
        <p>In Mosul, in northern Iraq, insurgents attacked three American military convoys on Wednesday with rocket-propelled grenades and roadside bombs, killing three Iraqi civilians and wounding five Americans, The Associated Press reported, citing the United States military and hospital officials.</p>
        <p>In Baghdad, on a generally quiet day, the United States reported that soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division had caught two former Iraqi Army generals in an early morning raid on Tuesday in Falluja. In a separate raid, soldiers found 225 mortar rounds, 20 rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun ammunition.</p>
        <p>''The two generals are suspected of being key financiers and organizers of anticoalition fighters operating in and around the city of Falluja,'' the military reported.</p>
        <p>One American soldier died Wednesday from a ''nonhostile gunshot wound,'' the military reported. Since the United States-led coalition invaded Iraq on March 19, 380 American soldiers have died in accidents or hostile fire.</p>
