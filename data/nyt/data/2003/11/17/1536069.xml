        <p>Archdiocese of Boston 'rebrands' annual fund-raising drive as Annual Catholic Appeal in effort to lift donations from disappointing level of 2002, when it was known as Cardinal's Appeal and suffered because of Cardinal Bernard F Law's association with church's sex abuse scandal; fund-raising letters feature photos of parochial school students and other laypeople, not the archbishop; contributions are running 10 to 20 percent ahead of 2002; photo (M) (Giving: A Special Section)</p>

        <p>FOR nearly two decades, Cardinal Bernard F. Law was the face of the annual Cardinal's Appeal, the primary fund-raising drive for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. A letter from the popular archbishop, featuring his photograph, was enough to attract significant donations.</p>
        <p>Then Cardinal Law became associated with the sexual abuse scandals that rocked the archdiocese and forced his resignation last December amid allegations that he had tolerated the abuse of children by priests under his supervision. Furious at Cardinal Law and other church leaders, many Boston Catholics boycotted the Cardinal's Appeal, and some pastors refused to take part. The archdiocese staff that handles the appeal culled mailing lists as more people said they would not pledge. The Cardinal's Appeal scraped in $8.9 million last year, a drop from the $16.2 million raised in 2001.</p>

        <p>FOR nearly two decades, Cardinal Bernard F. Law was the face of the annual Cardinal's Appeal, the primary fund-raising drive for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. A letter from the popular archbishop, featuring his photograph, was enough to attract significant donations.</p>
        <p>Then Cardinal Law became associated with the sexual abuse scandals that rocked the archdiocese and forced his resignation last December amid allegations that he had tolerated the abuse of children by priests under his supervision. Furious at Cardinal Law and other church leaders, many Boston Catholics boycotted the Cardinal's Appeal, and some pastors refused to take part. The archdiocese staff that handles the appeal culled mailing lists as more people said they would not pledge. The Cardinal's Appeal scraped in $8.9 million last year, a drop from the $16.2 million raised in 2001.</p>
        <p>In the words of Damien J. DeVasto, the director of the appeal, there has been a rebranding: the name has been changed from the Cardinal's Appeal to the Annual Catholic Appeal (a title that is also used by several other cities for their yearly diocesan appeals). This year's fund-raising letters, which were sent out beginning in April, feature photos of parochial school students and other laypeople, not the archbishop of Boston. And a new slogan, ''one church, many works,'' highlights the 80 programs and ministries that benefit from the appeal.</p>
        <p>This new approach signals a departure from the old one, which Mr. DeVasto described as ''steeped in hierarchy.'' The personality-centered campaign was not suited to realities in the church, nor did it reflect the image of the new archbishop, Sean P. O'Malley, a Capuchin Franciscan who wears the order's simple brown robe.</p>
        <p>Although it is still far below the levels of two years ago, this year's appeal has reached $8.2 million so far, which is 10 to 20 percent more than last year's contributions at this time, and is expected to reach the $9 million goal. (As of 2001, there were about 2.1 million Catholics in the archdiocese.)</p>
        <p>How much is attributable to the new marketing campaign is hard to say. About a third of this year's donors did not give last year, Mr. DeVasto said. He attributes most of the gains to positive feelings about Archbishop O'Malley, who was appointed by Pope John Paul II on July 1, 2003. Two months after the appointment, Mr. DeVasto said, the appeal raised about $1 million. And Archbishop O'Malley's decision in September to settle almost 550 lawsuits over sexual abuse by priests is likely to be received favorably by donors.</p>
        <p>''He's been totally positive,'' said Fred O'Neill, referring to Archbishop O'Malley. Mr. O'Neill, a Catholic, lives in Duxbury and is a senior vice president of the Suffolk Construction Company in Boston. He stopped donating to the archdiocese last year, but said he was giving again because he was impressed with the archbishop's sincerity, straightforwardness and ability to ''tell it like it is.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DeVasto hoped that the appeal, which finances more than 50 percent of the archdiocese's operating expenses, can reach its pre-scandal levels in a relatively short time. ''We're hopeful that over a three-year period, we'll find our way back,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not all Boston Catholics have returned to the flock, though, and many say they want to see more changes before they commit to opening their wallets. James E. Post, the president of Voice of the Faithful, a local group that seeks church reform, wants the archdiocese to publicize how the appeal money will be spent.</p>
        <p>''I cannot see how to contribute to a diocesan or archdiocesan campaign without a clear understanding of where that money is going to go and how it is going to be used, and I know I am not alone in that,'' Mr. Post said. ''The trust that was shattered doesn't come back as if by magic.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles E. Zech, a professor of economics at Villanova University in Villanova, Pa., who studies Catholic giving, said he expected that financial accountability would continue to be an issue. When the scandal first began, Dr. Zech said, major Catholic donors tended to be loyal to the church and did not cut off their sponsorship, but those donors may demand more now. ''There is some evidence, Dr. Zech said, ''that major donors are really worried about where their money goes.''</p>
        <p>Some religious charities have rebounded from overwhelming scandals, said Francis J. Butler, the president of Foundations and Donors Interested in Catholic Activities, a group of family foundations in Washington. Mr. Butler said that few people expected Covenant House, the child welfare agency in New York, to survive after its founder, the Rev. Bruce Ritter, resigned in 1990 amid allegations of sexual and financial misconduct, leaving the organization $38 million in debt. But under its new president, Sister Mary Rose McGeady, the charity regained 80 percent of its donors within three years.</p>
        <p>''What's operative here is people's faith,'' Mr. Butler said. ''They want this institution to work.''</p>
        <p>Boston Catholics seem willing to give to Catholic organizations besides the archdiocese. Boston Catholic Television held its most successful telethon ever this fall, and the Blessed John XXIII National Seminary in Weston had a record-breaking fund-raiser too. Although some parishes are still behind on their weekly collections, others have surpassed their 2001 totals.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Robert Bullock, the pastor of Our Lady of Sorrows in Sharon, a Boston suburb, said he campaigned for the appeal this year, but understood why other donors might hold back.</p>
        <p>''There is going to be a very strong wait-and-see attitude,'' he said. ''The only voice they have is a financial one, and they are making their voice heard.''</p>
