        <p>YOU know how it is. When you lived in New York City, you never visited the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building, unless you had out-of-town visitors. And so it is in Westchester, a county rich in attractions, which few of us who live here actually take the time to visit.</p>
        <p>I grew up in Westchester and have lived here most of my adult life, but over the last few weeks, I decided to play tourist in my home county. I quickly learned that taking in all the county has to offer is far more than a weekend pursuit. A misbegotten notion that I could take in the historic sites in Tarrytown in one day left me only halfway into my agenda after a breathless six hours, with that ''if it's Tuesday I must be in Rome'' feeling. Except in Tarrytown, it's ''if it's Friday I must be in the 17th, no 18th, no 19th century,'' while scrambling through one noteworthy Hudson River homestead after another.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Westchester and have lived here most of my adult life, but over the last few weeks, I decided to play tourist in my home county. I quickly learned that taking in all the county has to offer is far more than a weekend pursuit. A misbegotten notion that I could take in the historic sites in Tarrytown in one day left me only halfway into my agenda after a breathless six hours, with that ''if it's Tuesday I must be in Rome'' feeling. Except in Tarrytown, it's ''if it's Friday I must be in the 17th, no 18th, no 19th century,'' while scrambling through one noteworthy Hudson River homestead after another.</p>
        <p>A roundup of every place worth visiting in Westchester is impossible, but what follows are some highlights. Some are well known; some kind of quirky. My advice is to take advantage of the fact that you do live here, and budget your time leisurely. When you find yourself with a free weekend afternoon or a treasured weekday off, spend the time strolling through just one of the museums or gardens at your doorstep. One of the great things about many of the attractions in Westchester is that they are manageable in size. While you could never cover the Metropolitan Museum of Art in an afternoon, you could certainly familiarize yourself with the Katonah Museum of Art in that time. And you just might find that next time you have out-of-town guests, rather than automatically taking them into Manhattan, you might want to show them what we have right here at home.</p>
        <p>Looking Back, Looking Up</p>
        <p>I confess. I've driven by the signs for the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers countless times, and until recently, had never been there. What a loss! This museum is a great place to begin an exploration of Westchester, because it is dedicated to celebrating the river, which is pivotal to the county's history.</p>
        <p>The museum's first home was Glenview Mansion, built in 1876. The house sits above the river, overlooking not only the Hudson but also the railroad tracks, and those two views -- of both nature and technology -- symbolize the artwork within, which documents man's relationship with the Hudson through the ages. The museum's modern buildings, completed in 1969, also afford views of the river, as well as an outside cafe that visitors can enjoy in pleasant weather.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the museum is home to a strong collection of the 19th-century Hudson River School paintings, with works by Bayard H. Tyler, Samuel Coleman Jr., Jasper Cropsey, James Renwick Brevoort, Gifford Beal and Julian O. Davidson.</p>
        <p>Currently on display is a show called ''Imaging the River,'' which includes not only historical views but also contemporary visions. The exhibition features the work of 23 living artists as well as some of the 19th-century artists. One particularly gripping installation, by Alan Michelson, shows a video projection of the Indian Point Power Plant, with its lights twinkling across the river. The scene is framed by a traditional gilded frame, and it creates a startling contrast between the old and the new.</p>
        <p>Dan Ford's ''Morning in America'' depicts a charming scene of cattle at the river's edge, with a McDonald's tucked in just behind grove of trees.</p>
        <p>Because I was playing tourist, I visited the museum's gift shop, where I picked up a pretty set of note cards with reproductions from several Hudson River School painters.</p>
        <p>The Andrus Planetarium is within the Hudson River Museum, though admission is separate. It was closed the day I visited, but I plan to return for one of the star shows on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights at 7. Planetarium officials say that on Nov. 25, a brilliant Venus and a thin crescent moon will hang just above the horizon in the western sky. Around Christmas, the two come together again, higher in the sky and easier to see.</p>
        <p>You can call the Planetarium Skyline at (914)963-2139 for celestial updates. More down-to-earth information on the Hudson River Museum can be found at www.hrm.org or call (914)963-4550. Museum admission is $5 for adults, $3 for people 62 and older and children 4 to 12. Planetarium admissions is $5 for adults, $3 for people 62 and older and children 4 to 12. You can also buy a museum and planetarium combo ticket for $9 for adults, $5 for older people and children. Friday nights are free from 5 to 8.</p>
        <p>In the Japanese Tradition</p>
        <p>The day I drove up to the northernmost reaches of the county to visit the Hammond Museum in North Salem, I arrived in my usual frazzled state; it had been another day of multiple deadlines and commitments. But stepping into the Japanese stroll garden proved an instant antidote to suburban stress.</p>
        <p>A visitor goes to the museum first, which is a modest affair. There is currently a display of the works of Emi Tajima, a contemporary artist who has studied the traditional art of Japanese calligraphy. In the main hall on permanent display are small tapestry pieces by the museum's founder, Natalie Hays Hammond.</p>
        <p>To enter the garden, a visitor steps through a traditional Japanese teahouse. Immediately there is a sense of serenity. On the left is a waterfall garden, where a tiny stream falls gently over a stairwell of stones. Directly ahead is the pond, which is strewn with water lilies. There is a small island in the pond, accessible over a stone path. The self-guided tour explains that islands are considered sacred in Japanese mythology and are offered to the spirits as a resting place on their journey.</p>
        <p>To the right is a Zen garden of gravel, sand stone, presided over by a pair of ginkgo trees. It is minimalist, with planted rocks and sand raked into patterns suggesting water or clouds. Visitors are invited to use the special wooden rake to create their own pattern In traditional Buddhist monasteries, Zen gardens were used as an aid to meditation.</p>
        <p>There is a bamboo grove in the garden, and when I visited, the green leaves were just beginning to turn yellow. Farther along are stunning Japanese maples in an assortment of deep reds. Coming around a bend, I thought I had stumbled onto an old cemetery, but after a closer look (and a consultation with the pamphlet) I discovered that the cluster of 16 stones there, which stand vertically, is known as the Garden of the Buddhist Saints, to honor the enlightened followers of Buddha.</p>
        <p>I had the garden almost entirely to myself, with the exception of one couple who were sharing lunch on one of the benches scattered around for contemplation. It was almost entirely silent, except for the wind rustling through the bamboo trees. Lunch is available at the Silk Tree Cafe, and the museum gift shop offers many things Japanese, ranging from scarves to calligraphy sets to books on haiku. I left in a transformed mood, and on my return was far more appreciative of the beauty of the North Salem woods that lead to the museum.</p>
        <p>The museum and garden are open Wednesdays through Saturdays from noon to 4 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults and $4 for those 62 and over; children under 12 are free. For more information call (914)669-6777 or visit www.hammondmuseum.org.</p>
        <p>History, Close-Up</p>
        <p>The historic Hudson Valley is really the centerpiece of Westchester tourism industry. Do not make the mistake that I did, and try to do it all in a day. These sites are really extraordinary and deserve more than short shrift.</p>
        <p>As you walk across wooden bridge to enter the Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow, a tour guide will tell you that ''you are now entering 1750.'' And, with the exception of other tourists dressed in 21st-century clothing, you could pretty much believe it. You'll be visiting the milling, farming and trading complex originally owned by Frederick Philipse, who in 1693 was granted a charter for 52,000 acres along the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>First stop is the mill, which was built on the site of its original foundations. They call the guides here interpreters and they are dressed in period garb. In the 18th century, Philipsburg was run by enslaved Africans, and as life on the estate is described, it is very much with an eye toward what life was like for the slaves in colonial New York. It is believed that the mill was run by a slave named Caesar and an interpreter demonstrates how corn meal was made. (Visitors can buy corn meal and wheat flour made at the mill, which are sold in cloth sacks and cost $2 a bag.)</p>
        <p>Next stop on the tour is the manor house. Basically, Mr. Philipse owned about a third of Westchester County, running from Yonkers to Cortlandt, so I was expecting the house to be something along the lines of Kykuit, the Rockefeller estate. But the residence, built in 1680, would barely qualify as a McMansion in today's Westchester, though for its time, it was quite grand. In any event, the restored house, which the Philipse family didn't occupy year round, is one of the oldest remaining structures in the county.</p>
        <p>Ceilings are low -- not because, as I imagined, people were shorter, but rather because the low ceilings conserved heat. There is a communal room, an upstairs kitchen, several bed chambers, and historic furnishings, including a backgammon set that is more than 300 years old. When our tour guide showed us the dining room, she described it as a place ''where enslaved Africans might be serving while listening to the discussion of the potential sale of their child.''</p>
        <p>There is a tour of a slave garden, the barn, and an explanation of planting, a literal demonstration of separating the wheat from the chaff and more. The grounds are also home to historic breeds of cattle, sheep and chickens.</p>
        <p>If you visit Philipsburg Manor, the Sleepy Hollow Cemetery is just across the street, and worth a peek to see the grave of Washington Irving, who in 1849 wrote about what a mistake it would be to name the cemetery after Tarrytown.</p>
        <p>''I trust that I shall one day lay my bones there. The projectors are plain matter-of-fact-men, but are already, I believe, aware of the blunder which they have committed in naming it 'Tarrytown' instead of 'Sleepy Hollow' Cemetery. The latter name would have been enough of itself to secure the patronage of all desirous of sleeping quietly in their graves.''</p>
        <p>Where Irving Slept</p>
        <p>How can you live in Westchester and not visit Sunnyside, the Tarrytown home of Washington Irving? The author is best remembered for ''The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'' and ''Rip Van Winkle'' but he was a prolific writer, and produced works of fiction, history and biography in addition to holding diplomatic posts in Great Britain and Spain.</p>
        <p>Irving bought Sunnyside, now a National Historic Landmark, in 1835. It was then a simple cottage, but like many Westchesterites, Irving enlarged and remodeled it.</p>
        <p>It has been restored to the time during which he lived there. The interpreters at Sunnyside seem genuinely fond of the man. A woman in the kitchen, dressed in a mid-Victorian period ankle-length dress with an apron, pointed out many of Irving's inventions around the house -- not the least of which was a plumbing system that allowed for hot water baths -- with a sense of pride. She shook her head sadly while describing how Irving never got over the death of his fiancée, explaining how in letters after her death, Irving would compare every other woman to his ''beloved Matilde.''</p>
        <p>Sunnyside overlooks the Hudson River, and Irving was unhappy when the railroad laid tracks between his home and the water. As a consolation, the railroad gave Irving his own stop at his house.</p>
        <p>Visitors can still enjoy the proximity to the river; there are picnic tables among the walkways, and a seasonal cafe.</p>
        <p>Visitors can choose between a guided tour or a self-guided tour. Sunnyside is open daily in November and December, except Tuesdays, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (The last tour is at 3 p.m.) It will be closed for the months of January and February. Admission is $9 for adults, $8 for older people and $5 for children. For more information, call (914)631-8200.</p>
        <p>For Gardens and Sculpture</p>
        <p>Kykuit closed for the season on Nov. 2, but no overview of tourism in the county -- no matter how cursory -- can fail to include this estate, home to four generations of the Rockefeller family. It will reopen in April and should go on the ''to do list'' of anyone who still ponders the question of whether the rich are different than you or me. Well, they certainly have nicer stuff, and lots more of it. And in this case, they are generous enough to allow the public to marvel at it.</p>
        <p>No matter how often you visit Kykuit, it never fails to amaze. In addition to a breathtaking view of the Hudson River, formal gardens, fountains, stone terraces, there is Nelson Rockefeller's extensive 20th-century sculpture collection. And all that is before you enter the mansion, which manages to be exquisite and to seem quite livable at the same time. The house is presented as it was in the early 1900's, but with the relatively new additions of modern art and some Chinese ceramics. During the tour you can marvel at the furniture and art, and also visit nooks and crannies like the butler's pantry (roughly the size of my first apartment in New York City) where the sink appears to be stainless steel but is actually made of a nickel alloy. Why? So if you drop a dish, it won't break. Ah, the Rockefellers, so rich and yet so thrifty!</p>
        <p>During the season you have a choice of three tours. First-time visitors are advised to take the House and Garden Tour, which visits the main floor of the house, the art galleries, the terraced gardens and the Coach Barn. It takes about two hours. The Gardens and Sculpture Tour includes an exploration of Kykuit's formal gardens and Nelson Rockefeller's sculpture. The tour leads visitors to garden areas not seen on the House and Garden Tour, but does not include the house or the barn. Last year, Kykuit added a new option, the Grand Tour, an extended visit that is said to combine the best of the two other tours and offers a visit to the second floor balcony of the house.</p>
        <p>Reservations for all tours are recommended. Admission is $20 for adults, people 62 and over, $19 and children under 17, $17. The tour is not considered appropriate for children under 10. During the season call (914)631-9491.</p>
        <p>Art for the Soul</p>
        <p>David Rockefeller once remarked that nowhere else in the world will one happen upon a church filled with stained-glass windows by Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall. Of course, these windows don't just happen to be at the Union Church of Pocantico Hills, where the Rockefellers have long worshiped; rather they are a result of the family's history as patrons and collectors of great art. It was Nelson Rockefeller who pursued Matisse to create a memorial window for Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, Nelson's mother. Mrs. Rockefeller had met Matisse in Paris several times during the 1920's, and had been an early admirer of the painter. Matisse created the rose window, which is on the east wall of the church above the chancel. The large round window sits almost like a crown jewel, in colors of light blue, green, yellow and white.</p>
        <p>The Chagall windows were also commissioned as memorials. For John D. Rockefeller Jr., the family chose the theme of the Good Samaritan, with its links to Mr. Rockefeller's philanthropic life, as the most appropriate parable. While the plans for the Good Samaritan window were being discussed, David Rockefeller asked Chagall to create another memorial window for Michael Rockefeller, one of Nelson's sons, who was lost in New Guinea at the age of 23. That commission was expanded to include all the nave windows. Six of the windows depict prophets, while the seventh, Michael's memorial, illustrates the verse from Matthew, ''Seek and ye shall find.'' (There is an eighth nave window, which was Chagall's original design for Michael's memorial. It depicts cherubim guarding the gates of paradise. But the family preferred a different theme. That original Chagall design is illuminated by artificial light.)</p>
        <p>Chagall came to stained glass rather late in his career, and my guide told me that when the director of the Chagall museum came to visit the church, her assessment was that the windows in the Pocantico Church represented the peak of Chagall's work. I prefer Chagall's own appraisal. When he came to Westchester for the 1965 dedication of the windows, he was asked what he thought of the final product. In what may be the ultimate artistic understatement, he is reported to have said, ''C'est bon.''</p>
        <p>The church is open daily except Tuesdays April through December. Weekday hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays 2 to 5 p.m. Church activities occasionally alter the schedule. For more information, call (914)631-2069. Admission is $4.</p>
        <p>Stenciled Elephants Await</p>
        <p>How can you resist this circus poster, circa 1861? Among other attractions it lists ''The Laughable Farce 'The Two Buzzards,' which has never failed to convulse the audience with merriment.''</p>
        <p>You might not be convulsed with merriment, but you can certainly pass some enjoyable time at this quirky collection of circus memorabilia in Somers, which bills itself as ''the Cradle of the American Circus.'' The Somers Circus Museum is housed in the old Elephant Hotel, which is also the home of the Somers town government. To get to the museum you will climb upstairs, passing the receiver of taxes and the town clerk, until you see red stenciled elephants leading to the top floor of the building.</p>
        <p>The first thing that caught my eye was the extraordinary miniature circus, billed as ''the Greatest Little Show on Earth.'' It is an historical replica of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus during the 1920's, with more than a thousand small figurines taking up their places in a display that occupies almost the entire room. There are the circus trains along the back, and miniature tables set where the performers ate and relaxed. A Wild West show, popular in circuses in the late 1800's, is played out on a field, where miniature cowboys and Indians engage in battle. An oval track circles the three rings, filled with parades of soldiers, horses and elephants. Then of course there are the three rings themselves, complete with a tiny lion tamer in the middle, ballerinas on horseback to the right and what appears to be a dog act on the left.</p>
        <p>All this can get you in the mood to trace the history of the circus in America, which the museum chronicles with an emphasis on local connections. The traveling menagerie developed in Somers as a form of entertainment with the purchase of one elephant by Hachaliah Bailey, a Somers farmer and cattle manager. His traveling show also included four wagons, a trained dog, several pigs and six horses. Circuses and menageries joined forces beginning in the 1830's. These traveling and tented shows expanded and multiplied and many performers came from Somers and the surrounding vicinity. Charles Wright, for instance, whose family roots go back in Somers some 250 years, was the first lion tamer in America. His lion was the third ever to be imported to America from Africa.</p>
        <p>On display are things like the velvet waist coat and breeches worn by Tom Thumb, ''the American Man in Miniature'' when he appeared before Queen Victoria in the mid-19th century. One undated circus poster promises to present ''the Greatest Natural National Curiosity of the World.'' That curiosity was Joice Heth, who was purported to be not only the former nurse to ''General George Washington'' (the poster explains that she was ''the slave of Augustine Washington, father of George'') but also to be 165 years old.</p>
        <p>I learned a lot of interesting things, not the least of which was that one popular circus event used to be ostrich racing -- with the ostriches ridden by jockeys. There is a new display about the Stratton family, as well as some general historical material on Somers. Also, a library with a focus on circus books is available for researchers.</p>
        <p>You have to really want to go to the Circus Museum to see it. It's only open on Thursdays, between 2 and 4 p.m., as well as the second and fourth Sunday of the month from 1 to 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>A Gem Near the Interstate</p>
        <p>The Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens in Purchase were not new to me, but I was happy to have an excuse to return to them. This extraordinary collection of 45 works by major 20th-century artists is another one of these oases -- a place of great, quiet beauty tucked into the landscape not far from Interstate 287.</p>
        <p>Visitors drive into the headquarters of PepsiCo, where they will be stopped by a security guard. Explain that you are visiting the sculpture garden, and the guard will give you a parking pass and direct you to the visitors' lot. A tour is self-guided, and the sculpture and gardens unfold around PepsiCo's corporate headquarters, which itself is set on 168 acres.</p>
        <p>You can spend anywhere from a half-hour to all day strolling the grounds. I visited on a blustery fall day, and the winds had a major affect on George Rickey's ''Double L Excentric Gyratory II,'' a work of two L-shaped pieces of stainless steel mounted on a single pole. Since the two pieces move with the air currents, I saw the sculpture in a particularly active mode.</p>
        <p>The weather didn't affect Auguste Rodin's ''Eve,'' a standing nude he sculptured in 1881, who appeared as serene as she has been for the last 122 years. A personal favorite is George Segal's ''Three People on Four Benches,'' a 1979 work that depicts two women and one man sitting in a resigned way that suggests near-permanent patience. The man faces Claes Oldenburg's ''Giant Trowel II,'' which looks, well, like a giant trowel, jammed into the ground.</p>
        <p>The last time I had seen Arnaldo Pomodoro's ''Triad,'' the largest sculpture in the collection, had been before Sept. 11, 2001. Recently, staring up at the three towering bronze columns, parts of each which have been stripped away to reveal jagged fissures, couldn't help but remind me of the ravaged World Trade Center towers.</p>
        <p>Immediately surrounding the PepsiCo building are more formal style gardens with clipped hedges, trained trees and a fabulous fountain sculpture -- David Wynne's ''Girl With a Dolphin.'' Many of the smaller sculptures are also nestled in this area, like Henry Moore's ''Reclining Figure'' and ''Locking Piece.''</p>
        <p>The landscape beyond is home to the larger works, and other specialty gardens, ponds dotted with water lilies, and a path that winds through the area. Its outdoor sculpture, tremendous space and all the different perspectives it affords, makes this sculpture garden a particular gem.</p>
