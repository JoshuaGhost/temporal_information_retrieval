        <p>SOME star musicians take their stardom seriously. You don't just meet them; you're invited to approach and kiss the ring. But there are others, the more human kind, who simply laugh. And I can hear the laughter halfway down the street -- an otherwise sedate Edwardian boulevard in a West London suburb -- as I make my way to Tasmin Little's end-of-summer garden party.</p>
        <p>High-pitched squeals come ricocheting through the open front door. And it's not just children, though there are enough of them. It's like a kindergarten: tiny writhing bodies everywhere. And keeping order, just barely, with plates of sausage rolls and a handful of baby wipes is the exuberantly cheerful (O.K., squealing) Tasmin Little. Housewife, mother, star violinist.</p>
        <p>''Isn't it fantastic?'' she says. ''Have a sausage roll. No, Chloe, not there. . . .'' and she dashes off to stanch a tear or soothe a tantrum.</p>
        <p>Back inside the house two invaluable violins, a Guadagnini and a famous Stradivarius (the Regent), are tucked safely away from prying fingers. And the only obvious indication of Ms. Little's public life (which, in the circumstances, you could easily forget) sits in a corner of the living room -- although it's such a curious-looking thing, it takes a while to figure out what it is.</p>
        <p>It is in fact a music stand, but with the music on a computer screen rather than on paper. Page turns are controlled by electronic foot pads. And the whole contraption was put together by Ms. Little's husband, Mike Hatch (a recording engineer, handy with a screwdriver), as a solution to the peculiar problems of a work she plays with Simon Rattle and the Berlin Philharmonic on Wednesday at Carnegie Hall and next Sunday at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>The piece is the heart of a tour program that has already been performed in Berlin; Salzburg, Austria; and London. To celebrate the 80th birthday of the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti, Ms. Little plays his Violin Concerto: a modern masterwork acclaimed at its premiere 10 years ago but rarely heard since -- partly because it speaks on such a small, intimate scale that it doesn't deliver what audiences expect from a concerto, but also because that small scale asks for microcosmic virtuosity beyond the reach of most performers. It's Ms. Little's current speciality.</p>
        <p>''But goodness me, it's hard,'' she says, with Chloe and the sausages entrusted to a nanny. ''Probably the hardest concerto ever written. And I know you could say that of other pieces, but believe me, I've never been confronted with anything more challenging, more complex or more difficult to learn. I pick things up fairly quickly, but when I first encountered this music, it took three solid months to get it under my fingers. And it's tough for the orchestra, too.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Little first played it with Sir Simon conducting the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra.</p>
        <p>''We got to the end of the first movement, which is a 4-minute marathon that feels like 20, and Simon and I just looked at each other and sighed with relief that we'd made it through,'' she says. ''The end is crazy, too, because it finishes with a solo cadenza that Ligeti expects you to write yourself, which I've done. It leaves the piece in the soloist's hands except for a sudden orchestral cutoff, where the conductor more or less says: 'Right. That's quite enough of that. Goodbye.'</p>
        <p>''But the basic problem from start to finish is that there's no time to turn the pages of the music, which is mostly fast, with cascades of notes. The last time I played it, I dismembered the score and stuck the bits on two sides of a huge piece of cardboard, but it looked like a children's craft project gone wrong. So now I'm trying my husband's invention here, and it's perfectly brilliant. I step on this pad to turn the page forward and this pad to turn it back -- which I hope won't be necessary in performance.''</p>
        <p>Her enthusiasm for her husband's home mechanics is, like her enthusiasm for most things, loud and infectious. Small in stature (barely 5 foot 2), Ms. Little has a huge personality, though not a grand one. She's the girl next door writ large, avoiding the see-me-suffer-for-my-art approach of certain colleagues on the violin circuit. She has never cultivated the mystique of her contemporary Anne-Sophie Mutter (40 this year, against Ms. Little's 38). She doesn't have the soulful temperament of Maxim Vengerov or the moody teenage appeal of Joshua Bell.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, disadvantages to being approachable and ordinary. For one, it won't attract the fees that Ms. Mutter gets. Then there's the risk of being dismissed as a lightweight, without gravitas.</p>
        <p>''There was a time when people saw me as local English talent rather than someone out there in the world,'' Ms. Little says. ''But that's changed in the past few years. I think I've turned a corner. Between now and Christmas, only two of my concerts are in the United Kingdom. The rest are abroad. Next year about 50 percent are abroad.''</p>
        <p>To say that she has turned a corner is an understatement. There was certainly a time when she looked like local entertainment: feisty, fun, an audience winner in a sparkly dress (her trademark). But she moved on. She acquired sophistication, depth, assurance, class. By any reckoning she now ranks with the Vengerovs, Mutters and Bells. And no violinist anywhere more effectively communicates the joy of playing.</p>
        <p>''Not so long ago I had a date at the Musikverein in Vienna, and it was one of those nights when everything was perfect,'' she says, ''the hall, the conductor, the orchestra. I felt absolutely confident. And in those circumstances you feel free as a bird. I love that feeling.</p>
        <p>''As a musician, you spend years learning the notes, dealing with the technical difficulties. But the thing is to get beyond that, to the point where you don't have to think about technique. Then you can really play. And that's the difference for me now. I think I've reached that possibility. I'm not apologizing anymore for wanting to be a soloist.''</p>
        <p>If the idea of her ever having to apologize sounds strange, you should know that Ms. Little grew up at a time when there were few role models for English violin virtuosos. Britain produced superb orchestra leaders but not first-rank soloists, and her admission to the club was gradual. There was no overnight success in a competition; no overnight anything.</p>
        <p>BUT she started young, with a scholarship at age 8 to the famous (infamous, some would argue) Yehudi Menuhin School for musically outstanding children. At that time it was an experimental hothouse close to London, with just 35 pupils, not too much discipline and a reputation for damaging more young performers than it nourished. Nigel Kennedy was there when Ms. Little joined; he used to pull her hair.</p>
        <p>Thanks in large part to an exceptionally close and level-headed family, she emerged at 18 with her sanity intact. (As it remains; for all the shrieks and giggles, she is well organized, well balanced and dependable.) Her mother worked in a department store; her father was an actor. And apart from boarding at the Menuhin on weekdays, she had a normal northwest London childhood.</p>
        <p>''Because dad was in the business, the idea of being a performer was something we took for granted,'' she says. ''I had no special treatment. I could never shuck off the washing-up to protect my hands. Nothing so precious.''</p>
        <p>After Menuhin she moved on to the Guildhall School in London and into concert life, making her mark with repertory beyond the mainstream: lots of Delius (an abiding love) and new or rare concertos. She made her debut at the London Proms in 1990 with the Janacek Concerto, not well known.</p>
        <p>''That was a godsend,'' she says, ''because there wasn't likely to be anyone in the hall who knew it better than me and who'd complain, 'She didn't get the tempo in the second movement,' like they do.''</p>
        <p>The Proms secured Ms. Little's reputation. Immediately afterward, EMI released her first CD (a potent combination of Bruch and Dvorak concertos, engineered by Mr. Hatch before he became her husband). Since then, she has appeared in every Proms season but two. ''One year I was pregnant with Chloe, then I was actually having Ashley,'' she says of her daughters, now 2 1/2 and 1.</p>
        <p>Being a virtuoso and a mother isn't easy. With both children, she continued playing until two weeks before giving birth, she says, ''though I had to develop a new E-string technique to stop my bowing arm hitting my bump.'' And since the births, she has made a point of taking Chloe and Ashley everywhere she tours.</p>
        <p>''What's the point in having children if you never see them?'' she asks. ''It takes organizing, but we have our nanny. And they're no distraction, really. I'm focused enough to be able to shut out the mayhem around me and work. I don't demand special circumstances. I'm not like that.''</p>
        <p>Thus the electronic music stand (surrounded by a barricade of toys) in Ms. Little's living room. She doesn't have a dedicated work space. Every note of the Ligeti concerto was perfected in the company of Barbie accessories, My Little Ponies and the under 5 collection in the Disney catalog.</p>
        <p>This must be what she means when she insists that motherhood has added a dimension to her playing.</p>
        <p>''The experience of children gives you more to say,'' she says. ''Sloppy but true.''</p>
