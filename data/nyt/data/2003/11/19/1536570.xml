        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took a shot yesterday at a potential political rival, Speaker Gifford Miller of the City Council, saying an e-mail message sent out by Mr. Miller's aide last week indicated that the speaker may be inappropriately using Council resources to begin a campaign for mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, a Democrat, has been coy about any mayoral aspirations, but a top aide sent out an unauthorized e-mail message soliciting résumés for a new communications director, saying that Mr. Miller ''is preparing to make a run for Mayor in 2005 and we're revamping and reorganizing the office to get ready.''</p>

        <p>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg took a shot yesterday at a potential political rival, Speaker Gifford Miller of the City Council, saying an e-mail message sent out by Mr. Miller's aide last week indicated that the speaker may be inappropriately using Council resources to begin a campaign for mayor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller, a Democrat, has been coy about any mayoral aspirations, but a top aide sent out an unauthorized e-mail message soliciting résumés for a new communications director, saying that Mr. Miller ''is preparing to make a run for Mayor in 2005 and we're revamping and reorganizing the office to get ready.''</p>
        <p>Under the City Charter, public officials are prohibited from using their position for personal gain.</p>
        <p>''They may feel that they can use public monies to go and campaign,'' Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. ''I always thought you couldn't do that.''</p>
        <p>Gene Russianoff, a senior attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group, said yesterday that he did not see a problem with the message. ''It doesn't say that this person will work on government time to promote Mr. Miller's candidacy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bloomberg, who has been criticized for spending his own money to promote a ballot proposal for nonpartisan elections, suggested a double standard. ''The good-government groups, I haven't heard from them yet,'' he said. ''I suspect if I did something like that, they'd be out there screaming.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Miller dismissed the comments yesterday. He said he had lost count of the number of times that the mayor's aides had commented on Mr. Bloomberg's political future.</p>
        <p>''This is a political job, and to pretend that there's no politics going on smacks a little bit of 'Casablanca,' '' Mr. Miller said, referring to a scene in the movie in which the authorities pretend not to notice gambling in a casino. ''This is a ridiculous, ridiculous nonissue.''</p>
