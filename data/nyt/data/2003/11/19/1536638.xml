        <p>THIS week's award for worst timing has to go to Rita Sabini. She made a three-hour trip by bus and subway from her home in Astoria, Queens, to the headquarters of the Yonkers Public Schools system here, where -- lacking a scheduled appointment but full of vigor -- she had hoped to embark upon a new career as a substitute teacher.</p>
        <p>The only problem was that she arrived at the door of the district's headquarters a day after school officials approved the layoff of more than 500 district workers.</p>
        <p>''It's just unbelievable,'' said Ms. Sabini, 31, in the lobby of the district's offices. ''I was hoping to have an interview, but I was told that may be difficult at this moment because I was told there were 500 teachers who were laid off.'' Application in hand and framed by rows of the district's ''Employee of the Month'' plaques, Ms. Sabini shook her head and let out a wistful chuckle. ''I just have to laugh about it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She was just about the only one. Across Yonkers yesterday, parents and students lamented the layoffs and other cost-cutting moves that were put in place to close a $20 million gap in the budget of the 26,000-student district. In addition to the layoffs, the school board voted on Monday to abolish arts and music programs in schools and to reduce the work hours of guidance counselors and school social workers.</p>
        <p>A day after the vote, students worried about the fate of their studies, their participation in school bands, their work in art classes. And they were disappointed that periods formally full of lively color and melodious sound could now be devoted to bland, silent study halls.</p>
        <p>Parents in this urban school district, which has recently redoubled its efforts to reverse years of poor student performance, wondered why the cuts were being made even though the system has shown some improvement on state achievement tests.</p>
        <p>A good question, said the district's superintendent of schools, Angelo Petrone, and one with a simple answer: a lack of money. Mr. Petrone said that the school district, in Westchester County's most populous city, had not received a fair share of money from the State Legislature.</p>
        <p>Mr. Petrone denied that the district was using the cuts as an excuse for a bit of budgetary brinksmanship intended to pressure Albany into ponying up the millions needed to fill the hole in the $344 million budget. But he added that he nevertheless hoped for some development that might allay the cuts, which he said were the deepest in his 30 years as an educator here.</p>
        <p>''It's not because I favor one over the other,'' Mr. Petrone said of the arts and music programs versus the core curriculum of reading, math, science and social studies left intact under the adopted budget plan.</p>
        <p>''We needed to maintain the integrity of those core programs,'' the superintendent said. ''That's the meat and potatoes of what we do.''</p>
        <p>MANY here yesterday, though, still seemed to yearn for a little more gravy. ''It's a bad idea,'' said Peter Espinosa, 17, a student at Gorton High School. ''We work hard in our classes, and it's like we're working for nothing.''</p>
        <p>Peter said that he had played clarinet since grade school, and he attributed his affection for the instrument to his music classes. ''It's kids that have talent for music,'' Peter said. ''It's going to be sad for people who play instruments.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Abraham, 40, whose son Joseph Jr., 11, attends Emerson Middle School, wondered what kind of message the cuts sent to children about the value of education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abraham noted that Emerson and Twain Middle School were flagged for improvement under federal ''No Child Left Behind'' guidelines. He also wondered whether the gains in student achievement at Emerson and elsewhere would continue in light of the cuts. ''The government has labeled them bad schools and wants them to improve,'' Mr. Abraham said. ''If they want to keep the scores up, they need to keep giving them the money.''</p>
        <p>Brian L. King, 31, the father of another Emerson student, noted that the arts and music reductions were just the latest in a series of cuts. Parents are also upset about a plan to scale back free bus passes for high schoolers -- an idea that seems to be coming perilously close to the bone.</p>
        <p>''It's crazy,'' he said. ''Can't they find something else to cut? It's like what next? What are they going to cut next?''</p>
