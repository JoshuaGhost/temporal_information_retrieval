        <p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met in an effort to resolve the political standoff that began last week when the president fired three ministers and suspended Parliament. They exchanged views ''on events leading to the present situation,'' according to a joint statement issued after the meeting, and agreed to meet again. The statement also said they would continue a dialogue with all ''parties concerned.'' Ms. Kumaratunga's actions put on hold efforts to restart stalled peace talks with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have been fighting for an ethnic Tamil homeland for two decades.</p>
