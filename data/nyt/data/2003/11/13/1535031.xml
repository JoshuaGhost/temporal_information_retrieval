        <p>A picture in Business Day on Sept. 26 within a chart about the personal finances of Richard M. Scrushy, former chief executive of HealthSouth, was published in error. It showed a condominium on Ono Island in Orange Beach, Ala., that is owned by someone else, not one that the government hoped to seize from Mr. Scrushy. The error was brought to the attention of The Times on Oct. 29 by a Web site set up to defend Mr. Scrushy, who faces fraud charges, and was confirmed by the government this week.</p>
