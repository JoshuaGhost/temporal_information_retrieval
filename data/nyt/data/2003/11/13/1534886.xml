        <p>The government should sponsor small clinical trials on whether testosterone therapy can improve conditions like frailty, weakness, failing memories and loss of sexual function in aging men with low levels of the hormone, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences said yesterday.</p>
        <p>But large long-term studies to see if testosterone can prevent such conditions should be deferred until there is evidence that it works as a treatment, the committee added.</p>
        <p>The report, by the National Academies' Institute of Medicine, answers a question from the National Institutes of Health, which wanted to know what it should do to forestall a potential disaster as more and more men take testosterone without knowing whether it helps or harms.</p>
        <p>Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, which would conduct the studies, said he accepted the committee's advice. ''We intend to move forward quickly,'' Dr. Hodes said.</p>
        <p>Other experts on testosterone had mixed reactions, with some saying smaller studies would slow research while others said the research would move too fast.</p>
        <p>But all agree on the need for the research. More and more middle-aged and elderly men are taking testosterone, believing it can restore the vitality of youth, improve mood and memory and increase sexual drive. The Institute of Medicine report says that more than 1.75 million prescriptions were written in 2002, up from 648,000 in 1999.</p>
        <p>Researchers at the National Institute on Aging were concerned that the testosterone boom was a public health issue and wanted a large clinical trial. Those at the National Cancer Institute worried about giving healthy men testosterone in such a study when it might fuel the growth of prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>Last year, the heads of the two institutes asked the Institute of Medicine for help.</p>
        <p>''They felt like they were in a quandary, and they were not certain what steps should be taken,'' said Dr. Dan G. Blazer, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University and chairman of the Institute of Medicine's committee.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Blazer's committee set to work, the nation's experience with hormone therapy for menopausal women was on the minds of the members. Millions of women had taken estrogen and progestin for years, even decades, believing that it would protect against heart disease, osteoporosis, maybe even Alzheimer's disease. Many felt it kept them youthful and vigorous.</p>
        <p>But when the National Institutes of Health did a large study of the hormones in healthy women, it found that the drugs had risks, of heart disease and breast cancer, that were not outweighed by their benefits.</p>
        <p>No one wanted to repeat that experience with testosterone, Dr. Blazer said.</p>
        <p>The committee searched for evidence that testosterone helped aging men. Many symptoms of aging -- weakness, diminished sex drive, osteoporosis and a sense of malaise -- occur in young men who do not make testosterone. The symptoms are reversed with testosterone therapy. Testosterone levels gradually fall as men grow older.</p>
        <p>But published studies were dismaying. ''We were struck by the real paucity of studies and the relatively small number of subjects in them,'' Dr. Blazer said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, he said, testosterone may well be effective and the published studies do not show it is harmful.</p>
        <p>Still, the harms like an increased risk of prostate cancer or heart attack would emerge only from large studies, for example the federal study of estrogen in women, which followed thousands of participants for years.</p>
        <p>Some are impatient for such studies and think the new report calls for too slow a pace.</p>
        <p>''Essentially what this means is we won't know for a long time,'' said Dr. Alvin Matsumoto of the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, who had proposed a large testosterone study.</p>
        <p>Dr. John B. McKinlay of the New England Research Institutes in Watertown, Mass., said proposing small trials was premature. There is no consensus on what level of testosterone in an older man is too low, Dr. McKinlay said; nor is there a consensus on how to measure testosterone levels, which can fluctuate from day to day.</p>
        <p>''I would say that by doing these small studies, they are taking a Mr. Micawber approach to science,'' Dr. McKinlay said of the committee's report. He explained that Mr. Micawber, a Dickens character, ''always said he hoped something good would turn up.''</p>
        <p>''Let's do a trial here, a trial there, and if something good turns up, we'll pursue it,'' Dr. McKinlay said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Hodes said the studies would give investigators an opportunity to carry out definitive clinical research at a far earlier stage than happened with estrogen. There, the effective studies only began after prolonged widespread use.</p>
        <p>With testosterone, Dr. Hodes said, ''this cow is not far out of the barn.''</p>
