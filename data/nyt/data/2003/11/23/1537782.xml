        <p>WHERE planes once took off from an airport in Manahawkin, people now push shopping carts down the aisles of a giant Wal-Mart. Over in Marlboro, the airport closed last year and developers are seeking to build a housing complex there for the elderly.</p>
        <p>The number of airports like these has declined almost 50 percent in New Jersey since World War II and the onset of suburban sprawl. They are known as general aviation, or public-use, airports. Oddly, their demise comes as the demand for plane use by individuals and corporations has grown, especially since regular airline service was reduced at the state's large commercial airports in Newark, Trenton and Atlantic City and stricter security screening was added after the terrorist attacks of 2001.</p>
        <p>The newest public-use airport in the state, the Spitfire Aerodrome, in Salem County, was built two decades ago, in 1983. Since then, 13 have closed. Since 1950, 37 have closed, dropping the total to 45, according to the State Department of Transportation. The reasons include high operating costs, community hostility and soaring land values as developers scramble for sizable tracts of land on which to build housing, shopping malls and office buildings.</p>
        <p>''The highest bidders for the properties are developers because this is prime real estate for construction of housing or commercial use or big-box type stores,'' said the state transportation commissioner, Jack Lettiere. ''The prices they pay are extraordinary, and there's tremendous economic pressure on the owner to go that way.''</p>
        <p>Nationally, the number has declined over the last decade by only about 10 percent, to 5,148, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. But, as in New Jersey, most of the public-use airports that closed were owned privately rather than by government entities like counties and municipalities. And Warren Morningstar, vice president for communications at the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, a trade group in Frederick, Md., said that in 1994 public-use airports were closing at the rate of one a week.</p>
        <p>''Fortunately, that trend has slowed down,'' Mr. Morningstar said. ''We now lose about 15 a year nationwide.''</p>
        <p>To stop the decline, many states have begun trying to save the airports by buying them or their development rights.</p>
        <p>''The solution is to acquire the airports; that's fairly common,'' said Philip Brito, manager of the New York district office of the F.A.A. ''One of our highest priorities is to fund the purchase of an airport by a local community or by the state.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey is no exception, but Mr. Lettiere says that here the idea is also to prevent sprawl. In recent years the state has acquired, or helped municipalities and counties to acquire, five airports, and it is acquiring eight more, in part with federal funds.</p>
        <p>''I think there is a core number of airports -- 17 general aviation airports -- that we believe are a must to preserve and that we have to have in our system, no matter how we do it,'' Mr. Lettiere said.</p>
        <p>As the state's public-use airports have declined, the number of airstrips and helipads for private use has increased. The F.A.A. lists more than 300. They can be found at corporate office complexes, industrial sites, banks, pharmaceutical companies, nuclear generating stations, hospitals, universities, military installations, farms, golf courses and parks. Even the New Jersey Turnpike Authority has one.</p>
        <p>But it is the fate of the public-use airports that so concerns the aviation industry and state officials, especially since 30 of the 45 airports of this type are privately owned -- so-called mom-and-pop operations that the state sees as especially vulnerable to sale and non-aviation development because they operate on small profit margins.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is a special case,'' said Mr. Morningstar of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. ''Unlike other states, the majority are privately owned. No other state has such a high percentage of privately owned public-use airports.''</p>
        <p>The loss of more airports could seriously hinder the state's economy and the national transportation network, experts say. State officials say that 70,000 jobs in the state are linked to civil aviation and that these airports generate more than $4.6 billion a year, according to a 1996 study by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. Most licensed pilots -- New Jersey has some 15,000 -- learn to fly at schools based at the public-use airports.</p>
        <p>''It's going to be difficult for general aviation to operate and develop the pilots in the future,'' Mr. Brito of the F.A.A. said. ''And as airports close, there will be pressure on other airports to handle their activities.''</p>
        <p>In addition, 13 of the state's general aviation airports, including the biggest one, Teterboro, are considered ''reliever'' airports, which serve smaller craft that otherwise might tie up the larger commercial airports, said Jim Peters, a spokesman for the F.A.A.</p>
        <p>In one case, the state bought the development rights of the 125-acre Central Jersey Regional Airport in Somerset County last March for $4.2 million after residents opposed a plan to update it. The previous owners continue to operate it, but the state hopes to ease the community opposition by keeping the airport going without enlarging it.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in Sussex County, the fear of a plan by Trinca Airport to expand prompted Green Township to buy it and keep it operating.</p>
        <p>''Generally speaking,'' Mr. Lettiere said, ''I don't think anyone wants to see airports expand around their communities; it's not our intent to expand them.'' The intent, he said, is ''to preserve the existing footprint at each airport.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey also bought development rights at Lincoln Park Airport in Morris County for $4.3 million in 2002. The first acquisition after the state began its airport preservation program was Greenwood Lake Airport in Passaic County, for $1.8 million, in 2000. Other airports that have been saved in the program are South Jersey Regional Airport in Burlington County and the Princeton Airport, said a spokeswoman for the Transportation Department.</p>
        <p>The state is currently trying to help Monmouth County acquire Allaire Airport, and it is looking to acquire Solberg Airport in Hunterdon County, which Readington Township tried to condemn to stop an expansion plan. The state is also working to acquire Alexandria Airport and Sky Manor Airport, also in Hunterdon County; Blairstown Airport in Warren County; Camden County Airport; Spitfire Aerodrome; and Sussex Airport in Sussex County.</p>
        <p>Manahawkin Airport closed in 1992, long before the state started its preservation program.</p>
        <p>Marlboro Airport had financial difficulties for years and was closed by new owners in November 2002. But state officials said they did not try to save it because the airport was close to a school and transmission lines and thus was not considered a core operation. Now, the proposal for building housing on the site is at a standstill as debate continues over zoning amendments.</p>
        <p>Hugh McElroy, chairman of the New Jersey Aviation Association, a trade group of aviation professionals, said the state's program to save airports was ''a step in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>''But it's far from a panacea,'' he added. ''From an economic standpoint, it would be prohibitive. There need to be other activities to augment the state's effort and it needs to be done on a case-by-case basis.''</p>
        <p>Governor McGreevey had such issues in mind last month when he established a commission to study the state's general aviation airport system and report back in a year.</p>
        <p>The commission is to take an inventory of all airports, review their finances and identify their role based on location and user demand. It is also to consider preservation efforts beyond public acquisition of privately owned airports and recommend ways to rehabilitate and preserve the airports.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lettiere said the commission would try to ensure that whatever development occurs in and around airports does not create more sprawl. ''We can't separate transportation, even aviation, from smart growth,'' he said.</p>
