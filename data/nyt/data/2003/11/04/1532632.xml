        <p>The two sons of a prominent dissident cleric, Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, were arrested Monday after they defied a ban on the use of an office, the Iranian Student News Agency reported.</p>
        <p>Ahmad and Saeed Montazeri, both mid-ranking clerics, were arrested by the Special Court of Clergy after they tried to use their building in the religious city of Qum. The building was sealed off in 1998 when their father was put under house arrest. The ban, however, was lifted in February.</p>
        <p>The arrest seems to be part of a new crackdown on reformist activists as tension between reformers and hard-liners increases ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled on Feb. 20.</p>
        <p>The tension was evident last week in Parliament when its Article 90 Commission issued a report accusing Tehran's hard-line public prosecutor, Saeed Mortazavi, of efforts to cover up the suspicious death of an Iranian-Canadian photographer.</p>
        <p>Zahra Kazemi, the photographer, was arrested in June while she was taking pictures of the families of detainees jailed in Evin prison. She died in a Tehran hospital in July of a brain hemorrhage caused by a blow to the head.</p>
        <p>The commission's report said Ms. Kazemi had been illegally arrested. It also accused Mr. Mortazavi of efforts to cover up the death and of forcing witnesses to change their testimony.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mortazavi lashed out at the allegations on Monday and said he was filing a suit against the head of the commission, Hussein Ansarirad, accusing him of spreading lies, the agency reported. Mr. Mortazavi was also accused of closing dozens of reformist newspapers and of arresting journalists.</p>
        <p>''I refused the commission's invitation because as the public prosecutor and prosecutor of Tehran's Revolutionary Court I do not recognize the commission's interference into judicial affairs as proper,'' he said.</p>
