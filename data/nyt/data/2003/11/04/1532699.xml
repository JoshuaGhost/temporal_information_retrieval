        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The advantages of small, one-room schoolhouses cited by Nicholas D. Kristof (column, Nov. 1) are available to any family simply by taking the children out of large, impersonal schools and home-schooling them.</p>
        <p>Home-schoolers consistently perform well on measures of academic achievement. Social life and academic enrichment are readily provided by community resources and a large, supportive network of home-schooling families.</p>
        <p>Five years ago we took our daughter, now a high school junior, out  of one of the largest public school systems in New York State in the middle of sixth grade. We consider it the best investment we have ever made in her future, and she is much happier and more productive outside the school environment.</p>
