        <p>A judge sentenced a former senior warden at Rikers Island to one to three years in prison yesterday for his role in the theft of a drawing by Salvador Dalí. The warden, Mitchell Hochhauser, 40, of Queens, pleaded guilty in September and implicated three other Rikers employees -- another assistant deputy warden and two correction officers, who were all charged and are still awaiting trial. In March, the $250,000 drawing, displayed near the entrance of a jail complex, disappeared, and it has not been recovered. In court testimony, Mr. Hochhauser said another assistant deputy warden, Benny Nuzzo, masterminded the theft and arranged to replace the Dalí drawing -- a depiction of Christ's crucifixion -- during a fire drill. Mr. Nuzzo has denied any role in the theft. The fake Dalí was discovered within hours, when a Rikers employee stopped to pray before the drawing, as he always did, and noticed the fake in its place.</p>
