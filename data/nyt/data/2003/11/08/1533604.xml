        <p>NIANTIC, Conn. Nov. 7  Those who knew him best wonder if it wasnt all a mistake, some kind of misguided Robin Hood complex, that led Ronald P. McKeown Jr. to give away money that prosecutors say he embezzled from a Red Cross fund for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>

        <p>Those who knew him best wonder if it wasn't all a mistake, some kind of misguided Robin Hood complex, that led Ronald P. McKeown Jr. to give away money that prosecutors say he embezzled from a Red Cross fund for victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>But with his suicide at his house here on Tuesday, one day before a scheduled court appearance on state criminal charges, no one may ever know just what motivated Mr. McKeown.</p>
        <p>At first glance, his life appeared to match the storybook charm of the riverfront peach-colored cottage he lived in with his wife, Deborah, and their two teenage children in this shoreline village in eastern Connecticut. Mr. McKeown, 52, was a Boy Scout leader who organized trips to Peru to repair houses for the poor. He was president of the Parent-Teacher Association.</p>
        <p>Friends say his big-hearted, good-humored nature matched his 6-foot-1, 240-pound stature.</p>
        <p>His next-door neighbor has a rooster whose early morning alarm has been a bit too early for some. ''Ron said, 'If people start getting on the bird's case, I think we should form a rooster protection group,' '' Joe Mascaro, 46, recalled Friday, laughing a moment after tearing up.</p>
        <p>But court records tell a different story. One year ago, the state charged Mr. McKeown with larceny, money laundering and forgery in connection with the embezzlement of more than $121,000 from the Liberty Fund, a Sept. 11 fund managed by the American Red Cross. Mr. McKeown was executive director of the southeastern Connecticut chapter from July 2001 until he resigned on March 1, 2002. The charges stemmed from a complaint filed by his Red Cross colleagues in May 2002.</p>
        <p>State prosecutors say Mr. McKeown prepared phony financial reports, used a post office box address to cover his tracks and opened a checking account for his own benefit in the name of the Red Cross. Court records also say that he instructed Red Cross volunteers to bring mail and unopened donation canisters to him, and that he pulled cash from his desk drawer to buy lunch for people in the office or to cover chapter expenses. Airline tickets to London, a DVD player, clothing and digital cameras were some of the items billed on a Red Cross credit card and shipped to Mr. McKeown's house, the records show.</p>
        <p>John J. Nazzaro, Mr. McKeown's lawyer, said that before his death, his client was prepared to plead not guilty. On Friday, he said Mr. McKeown gave away some of the Red Cross money.</p>
        <p>''He gave some of it to people who approached him after 9/11, like priests, clerics, psychologists,'' Mr. Nazzaro said. ''People who were overwhelmed with grief and stress. He'll take their names to his grave.''</p>
        <p>A longtime volunteer, Virginia Marion, told investigators that she collected hundreds of donations in the weeks after the attacks consisting of ''small amounts of change from children emptying their piggy banks, to as high as $3,000,'' according to the arrest warrant. Each time a money bag was full, she brought it to Mr. McKeown's office, as per his instructions. Investigators also found envelopes with a total of $2,800 in his house, money that prosecutors say belonged to the Red Cross.</p>
        <p>Everything unraveled for Mr. McKeown on Tuesday afternoon, the same week his son was to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout. State Police Detective Steven Rief said Mr. McKeown was pronounced dead at his home. The office of the state chief medical examiner is awaiting the result of toxicology reports to determine the manner of his death, but a spokeswoman there confirmed that the death was not by gunshot.</p>
        <p>On Friday, John F. Blawie, the senior assistant state's attorney who was prosecuting the case, said all criminal charges against Mr. McKeown had been dropped. Jane Gilbert, executive director of the Charter Oak Chapter of the Red Cross, which includes the Niantic area, said that the organization might seek to collect civil damages -- so far just the $2,800 has been returned -- but that for now, everyone was simply sad about Mr. McKeown's death.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blawie expressed condolences to the family, but, he said, ''we stand by the allegations we made in the arrest warrant.''</p>
        <p>In addition to fighting the criminal charges, Mr. McKeown faced other battles. He had difficulty paying his federal income tax; according to records in the town clerk's office, liens were placed on his property several times in the last few years. In 2002, he sustained numerous injuries in a near-fatal car crash, including the loss of an ear, Mr. Nazzaro said. He lived in nearly constant pain and took medication. During his one night in jail, he was placed on suicide watch, according to court records.</p>
        <p>Two days after his death, his friends recalled a man whose life they said had been overwhelmingly good. ''I think too much money came in too fast,'' said Denise Garofalo, a friend who lives in Niantic. ''I don't think there was any intention of hoarding it. He was a very, very generous man.''</p>
