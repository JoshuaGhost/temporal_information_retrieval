        <p>When United Nations officials speak of Iraq these days, any impulse to gloat is quickly supplanted by frustration over the harsh realities of the situation in Iraq and sadness over the loss of 22 colleagues and visitors who died in a bombing of their Baghdad headquarters in August.</p>
        <p>''There may be a temptation to rub one's hands together and say, 'Ha, ha! It's not working out the way Bush thought -- we told you so!' '' a senior United Nations administrator said this week. ''But, frankly, it's not good for anyone if the U.S. is defeated in Iraq.''</p>
        <p>The Bush administration's decision this week to speed up the transfer of power to the Iraqis won evenhanded, public praise from Secretary General Kofi Annan, who had long championed a quicker restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.</p>
        <p>But officials and diplomats here, while welcoming the policy change, warned privately against a rapid reduction of American military forces and said they feared that the United States would dump Iraq into the hands of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>''We in the international community are waiting for the tablets to come down from Washington,'' a foreign diplomat said nervously. ''Who knows what sort of face-saving formula they're going to come up with.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan has never been a proponent of a United Nations administration for Iraq, like those in East Timor or Kosovo. Instead, he has said that the United Nations should help shepherd the transition under the authority of a sovereign, broad-based interim government and alongside a multinational security force led by the United States and endorsed by the Security Council.</p>
        <p>But as the violence in Iraq has continued under the American occupation, the future participation of the United Nations in Iraq remains highly uncertain, officials say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan, citing security threats, has pulled the last of his non-Iraqi workers from Baghdad and left only about 40 others in the northern part of the country, most of whom are affiliated with the oil-for-food program, under which Saddam Hussein's government was allowed to sell oil for civilian needs despite sanctions imposed at the time of the first Persian Gulf war.</p>
        <p>The remaining foreign staff members are to leave when the program is transferred to the control of occupation forces on Nov. 21.</p>
        <p>A team from the United Nations headquarters in New York and staff members from Baghdad met this week in Nicosia, Cyprus, to discuss the future involvement of the world body in Iraq in a worsening security situation in which they and other aid workers have become targets.</p>
        <p>The group reviewed how the United Nations can continue to contribute to the rebuilding of Iraq and ensure the safety of its workers, officials said. The results of the talks, to be conveyed to Mr. Annan in a list of recommendations, are expected to have implications for United Nations missions in other conflict zones like Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>While the United Nations has insisted that the withdrawal from Baghdad is only temporary, officials say there is no clear timetable for a return. The review of future activities in Iraq is ''literally on a day-to-day basis,'' Shashi Tharoor, the under secretary general for communications and public information, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Fred Eckhard, a United Nations spokesman, said late this week that the policy discussions in Baghdad and Washington would not have an immediate effect on Mr. Annan's decision to revive United Nations operations in Iraq.</p>
        <p>''Should there be an improvement in security as a result of a change of approach, I think he would be more willing to consider sending his people back in,'' Mr. Eckhard said.</p>
