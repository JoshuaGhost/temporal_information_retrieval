        <p>With 39 days till Christmas, there is trouble at FAO Inc.: the possibility of another bankruptcy. This raises a decidedly grinchlike question. Could the F. A. O.

Could the store that made Macaulay Culkin the Holly Golightly of the under-12 set disappear by Christmas?</p>
        <p>These did not seem to be the questions on the minds of children romping through the store on Fifth Avenue last week. But after F. A. O. Schwarz's parent company, FAO Inc., said that lenders had balked at providing more financing to help it through the holidays, analysts who follow retailing speculated that the company's next move would be another bankruptcy filing.

        <p>With 39 days till Christmas, there is trouble at FAO Inc.: the possibility of another bankruptcy. This raises a decidedly grinchlike question. Could the F. A. O. Schwarz toy store go the way of failed New York retail landmarks like B. Altman and Bonwit Teller? Could the store that made Macaulay Culkin the Holly Golightly of the under-12 set disappear by Christmas?</p>
        <p>These did not seem to be the questions on the minds of children romping through the store on Fifth Avenue last week. But after F. A. O. Schwarz's parent company, FAO Inc., said that lenders had balked at providing more financing to help it through the holidays, analysts who follow retailing speculated that the company's next move would be another bankruptcy filing. That raised the question of the fate of the Fifth Avenue store.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that's knowable,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst at Harris Nesbitt Gerard in New York. ''My guess would be that they go into some kind of bankruptcy protection, and the outcome of that store is anybody's guess.''</p>
        <p>But he said that the Fifth Avenue store would probably last through Christmas. ''It would be an odd time to go out of business,'' Mr. McGowan said. ''It's not an odd time to be bankrupt. This is the time of year where toy retailers have the biggest cash crunch: they've bought the product, but the consumers aren't there yet.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the company did not return a call for comment, and an executive referred a reporter to an investor relations firm hired by FAO Inc. A spokesman there who spoke on the condition that he not be identified said that cash shortages and store closings were two different things. No stores were closed during the holidays last year, although the company filed for protection from its creditors in January after weak sales in November and December.</p>
        <p>''It's been looking bleaker and bleaker,'' said Chris Byrne, an independent toy consultant and contributing editor of Toy Wishes magazine. ''As to whether or not it's going to close, nobody knows.''</p>
        <p>But he said F. A. O. Schwarz was an ''iconic brand,'' and consumers know of the store from comedies like ''Home Alone,'' starring Mr. Culkin, and ''Big,'' the 1988 film that featured Tom Hanks dancing on a giant keyboard at the store.</p>
        <p>''It's one of the things that's celebrated about New York,'' Mr. Byrne said. ''The challenge F. A. O. is up against is, you really can buy the same stuff elsewhere.''</p>
        <p>That point that came up in interviews with shoppers at the store last week. Candace Colescott, a financial adviser from Redondo Beach, Calif., said she had been to the F. A. O. Schwarz store in Los Angeles but wanted to see the one in Manhattan. It was sold out of the toy that her son, Ryan, 8, wanted, and he was upset. She said Ryan preferred Toys ''R'' Us.</p>
        <p>Tina Cooper of Torrington, Conn., said she had not been to F. A. O. Schwarz in about 10 years. ''We're, like, amazed about the variety,'' she said. ''Whether you buy something or not, it's the excitement.''</p>
        <p>And that appeals to tourists, who do a lot of looking but not a lot of buying and who seem to make up a large portion of the customers in the Fifth Avenue store. Of a dozen or so shoppers questioned on a weekday morning, only two were from New York. Debra Hughes of Whitehall, Pa., a chaperon on her teenage daughters' school band trip to New York, was typical of shoppers who shied away from large purchases: no $400 standing baby zebras for them. ''If we didn't have to carry stuff, we would have bought more,'' Ms. Hughes said.</p>
        <p>But Richard Hastings, a retail analyst with Bernard Sands, said F. A. O. Schwarz faced another problem: the competition back home is fiercer than ever. ''The quality of toys in mass marketing channels like Target stores and Wal-Mart and Toys 'R' Us has risen,'' he said, ''providing compelling products at compelling prices and raising the question, What's so unique about F. A. O. Schwarz that I had to pay so much when I could have had so many toys?''</p>
