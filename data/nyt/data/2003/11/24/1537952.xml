        <p>Joyce Purnick column says eight finalist designs for Sept 11 memorial at World Trade Center site lack feeling of New York City (M)</p>

        <p>THEY have light, air, water and greenery. What the eight designs for the World Trade Center memorial do not have is a feeling of New York.</p>
        <p>The city's sensibility eludes easy definitions. But it is unmistakable. Times Square is New York.

        <p>THEY have light, air, water and greenery. What the eight designs for the World Trade Center memorial do not have is a feeling of New York.</p>
        <p>The city's sensibility eludes easy definitions. But it is unmistakable. Times Square is New York. So are Central Park, Union Square Park, the Chrysler Building, the Brooklyn Bridge -- all different from one another, but all sharing, for want of a more elegant phrase, a certain New Yorkness.</p>
        <p>That is part of it. New York is rarely elegant. It is dense, brash, exciting, loud, bold, irreverent.</p>
        <p>The eight designs remember the dead with candles, waterfalls, sanctuaries and lights. They are hushed, funereal and so generic they could be anywhere. It is difficult to imagine any of them seeming to be not just in New York but of New York.</p>
        <p>Most memorials do not relate to their surroundings; the Vietnam Veterans Memorial or the Holocaust Memorial Museum need not be in Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>This one is different. ''They attacked it because it was in New York,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, president of the New-York Historical Society. ''It wasn't Kokomo. It was New York, and New York represents something about power, diversity, aspirations, skyscrapers. New York is a monument to disorder, to diversity and jumbleness and a mixed-up quality of life.''</p>
        <p>The designs -- to be narrowed down soon to three finalists by a jury designated by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation -- reflect formality and restraint, not urban chaos.</p>
        <p>Visiting any one of them ''will be like visiting the Piet√†,'' said Bob Schneck, one of the visitors Saturday to the Winter Garden in Battery Park City, where the designs are on display. Mr. Schneck, who works for a brokerage firm nearby, recalled the trade center plaza. ''I don't mean to disparage these tries. They are wonderful efforts. But I don't think any of them fit into the spirit of what was. I just remember all the stores in that spot. The Borders was there, the shoe store was there. We were able to sit around the fountain. I just cannot imagine filling all that space with trees.''</p>
        <p>A friend of his, Barry Greenhut, predicted that New York would change the memorial. ''The spirit of the city will totally inhabit it,'' said Mr. Greenhut, who works with computers. ''People will make it whatever they want.''</p>
        <p>But the plans are designed with such precision that although the winning design might be modified before construction, it is hard to envision even willful New Yorkers changing it afterward.</p>
        <p>COULD a memorial both honor the dead and reflect the city in which they lived? Yes, says Mike Wallace, a co-author of ''Gotham.'' ''Remember Union Square Park after September 11?'' he asked. ''People were arguing, debating, there were signs -- all kinds of things. It was a civic meeting place.'' There might be ways to modify the winning memorial design, he suggested, to add more places for people to sit and congregate.</p>
        <p>Tony Hiss, who wrote ''The Experience of Place,'' makes similar points. ''You don't feel the city pressing up against these memorials,'' he said. ''They don't relate to what is there, the underlying nature and ecosystems of the place. There's nothing that has to do with the pulling together of people, which is what New York all about.''</p>
        <p>But to many, the trade center site is hallowed ground. Michele H. Bogart, an art historian and until recently a member of the city's Art Commission, says New Yorkers are sensitive to plans for this and other Sept. 11 memorials. ''There is this pressure to create cemetery-like memorials all over city,'' she said. ''Do the families want to have people standing around, doing whatever they do, on the plaza of the Seagram Building?''</p>
        <p>Probably not, but there might be more muted ways to evoke the city's character. One has to wonder if future generations visiting any of these memorials would realize that the victims of Sept. 11 died in a city that has always been a glorious idea as much as a place.</p>
        <p>It is its people from everywhere who get along more than they do not. It is noisy, confrontational, ever-changing and always prevailing -- even over terror.</p>
        <p>''These designs do not evoke the sense of the staggering varieties of people who all had this horrible rendezvous together at this moment,'' Mr. Wallace said. People who mostly did not know one another but who worked every day together in the same place. ''There is no sense of that, of daily life in this rough-hewn city.''</p>
        <p>Votive candles, reflecting pools and beams of light can soothe and restore. But perhaps this memorial, in this city in this time, could do more.</p>
