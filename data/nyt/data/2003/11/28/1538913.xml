        <p>Art in General  79 Walker Street, TriBeCa  Through Dec. 20</p>
        <p>Maria Elena González's sculpture weaves together three unlikely motifs: architectural floor plans, Minimalist floor sculpture and flying carpets. In the gallery, the work looks elegant but less imaginatively surprising than you would expect given the ideas that inspire it.</p>
        <p>''Wave'' consists of thin, wavy concrete tiles -- each embossed with the outline of a closet from an apartment floor plan -- arranged in a Carl Andre-style grid. The whole rectangle undulates like the surface of the ocean or a flying carpet.</p>
        <p>So you have a certain metaphorical tension among the closure of the module, the flux of the wave and the fantasy of magical flight. (There are two variations: ''Weave'' arranges similar tiles into a warp-and-woof pattern, and ''Flying Apartment Flotilla'' disperses tiles randomly around a room.)</p>
        <p>According to gallery literature, Ms. González's floor plans are specifically personal. A pair of rubber welcome mats, for example, have cast into them the footprints of the apartments of Cuban relatives. You wouldn't know there was any autobiographical or sociological urgency just by looking at her works, however, and therein lies the disappointment.</p>
        <p>One thinks by comparison of Do-Ho Suh, who transforms places he has lived in into elaborate, spiritually haunting fabric structures. Ms. González may intend a critical subversion of the Minimalist-Modernist grid, but her expressive reticence tends to smother potentially interesting psychological complexities.</p>
