        <p>The authorities said yesterday that nine pieces of bone and muscle were found on Monday by construction workers at a building near the site of the World Trade Center, and that these may be the remains of a victim of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner, said DNA tests would be used to try to identify the remains. The process, she said, will take at least several days, and it may prove futile because heat, humidity and other factors affecting human tissue decrease the effectiveness of the tests.</p>

        <p>The authorities said yesterday that nine pieces of bone and muscle were found on Monday by construction workers at a building near the site of the World Trade Center, and that these may be the remains of a victim of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.</p>
        <p>Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner, said DNA tests would be used to try to identify the remains. The process, she said, will take at least several days, and it may prove futile because heat, humidity and other factors affecting human tissue decrease the effectiveness of the tests.</p>
        <p>The remains were found on a scaffolding that had been put up before the attack, on the north side of a 25-story building at 90 West Street. The location is a block south of where the trade center's south tower stood.</p>
        <p>Lt. John Ryan of the Port Authority police told The Associated Press that the building had been searched for remains after the attacks, but that he was not surprised that more body parts had been found because burned-out floors and other obstacles had left parts of the building inaccessible.</p>
        <p>City officials say 2,792 people were lost in the attacks. Of those, 1,521 have been identified, Ms. Borakove said, with 785 of the identifications made entirely through DNA testing.</p>
