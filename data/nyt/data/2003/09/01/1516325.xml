        <p>The police arrested a 57-year-old man early yesterday and charged him with leaving the scene of an accident after an in-line skater was struck by a van, wedged beneath a cab and critically injured on the Lower East Side on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The man, James Simpson, of Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, was arrested at 2:01 a.m. at the Seventh Precinct on the Lower East Side after the police brought him in for questioning, according to a Police Department spokeswoman, Detective Cheryl Cristin.</p>
        <p>Additional details about how the investigation had led to Mr. Simpson were unavailable yesterday.</p>
        <p>The victim, whom the police identified as Avishay Cohen, 26, of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, remained in critical but stable condition yesterday evening at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, said a hospital spokesman, Peter Schectman.</p>
        <p>The police said that Mr. Cohen was hit by a maroon van at 8 p.m. Saturday as he was skating near Delancey and Ludlow Streets, a few blocks from the Williamsburg Bridge. After the collision, the police said, the van fled east on Delancey, heading for the bridge.</p>
        <p>Somehow, Mr. Cohen became trapped under a taxi.</p>
        <p>When the accident happened, Moaad Alsaedi, 21, a cashier working a noon-to-midnight shift at the Happiness Deli at 100 Delancey Street, said he heard two loud thumps, even with the deli's door closed and the air-conditioning humming inside. In the aftermath, he said, he also heard a woman scream.</p>
        <p>He later speculated that the first thump was the van hitting Mr. Cohen, while the second was Mr. Cohen being propelled underneath the yellow taxi, which had been parked just outside the deli.</p>
        <p>''The screaming was what caught our attention,'' Mr. Alsaedi said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Alsaedi rushed outside with a fellow employee, he found Mr. Cohen wedged between the taxi's rear wheels. The woman, also wearing in-line skates, seemed uninjured, he said. He added that Mr. Cohen and the woman, who appeared to have been skating together, were not wearing helmets. After a quick glance at Mr. Cohen, Mr. Alsaedi rushed back into the deli and dialed 911.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Mr. Alsaedi said, as he waited for help to arrive, he stood in the street and diverted traffic around the accident scene.</p>
        <p>Family members of Mr. Cohen did not respond to messages last night seeking comment.</p>
        <p>A police officer who responded to the call but declined to give his name said in an interview that he and several others worked together to lift the taxi off Mr. Cohen.</p>
        <p>''It was horrible,'' the officer said. ''What happened was crazy. I just couldn't figure out how he got pinned down there.''</p>
