        <p>He wears a gray beard and tight dreadlocks, a golf shirt and short pants, all of it rumpled and soiled as if he just arose from bed or never slept at all. The telephone in his apartment rings every three minutes or so, and hardly a postage stamp's worth of flat surface is clear.</p>
        <p>Life's minor miracle for the day is that Danny Simmons is able to concentrate at all. Some inner compass has prevailed, though, for he has a germ of an idea, and he will not be distracted, although the details will just have to fend for themselves.</p>
        <p>In short, Mr. Simmons wants art galleries in Brooklyn to put on a big group show, exchanging pieces and artists so that each can reach different audiences and perhaps increase exposure for black artists from the borough. There is no name for this show, no artists have been selected, and so far there has been only one meeting of gallery owners to discuss it.</p>
        <p>As scattered and half-baked as this notion may seem, it has gained attention in the highest quarters of the Brooklyn art world. Karen Brooks Hopkins, the president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, attended the sole planning meeting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons has the resources to bring his flights of fancy to the light of day. He is a board member at BAM, and he is the brother of the hip-hop impresario Russell Simmons and of the rap performer Joseph Simmons, who went by the stage name Run in the group Run-DMC. With financing and help from Russell Simmons, he has carved a small niche for himself in the world of fine arts while his brothers invented their own enormous niche in popular music.</p>
        <p>Danny Simmons says he sought his brother's help after failing to sell his paintings in Manhattan in the 1980's. ''I got the feeling that there was only room for one black artist, and that was Jean-Michel Basquiat,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Danny and Russell Simmons formed the Rush Philanthropic Arts Foundation to promote black artists, and Danny Simmons described his latest idea as an extension of that endeavor.</p>
        <p>He plans to proclaim his plan tomorrow at an exhibition in the gallery attached to his apartment, the Corridor Art Gallery in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. ''It's a formal announcement that we're working on it,'' Mr. Simmons said.</p>
        <p>The intent, he said, is to ''put together a racially diverse art show.''</p>
        <p>''I wanted the Bedford-Stuyvesant audience to be in Dumbo and conversely to have their audiences over here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other gallery owners say they are interested in Mr. Simmons's idea, but they are quick to assert that, at least at this stage of development, the notion is less than revolutionary. Few mainstream galleries in Brooklyn seem to have much desire to be perceived as ones that never gave black artists a chance until Mr. Simmons came along with his access to financing.</p>
        <p>''We work hard to represent ethnic and geographic diversity here,'' said Janet Riker, the director of the Rotunda Gallery in Brooklyn Heights. Still, she added, ''the idea of partnering with other organizations is healthy. The actual idea is Danny's. I think it was a heartfelt idea.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hopkins, the BAM president, described Mr. Simmons's idea as an opportunity for Brooklyn artists of all races and neighborhoods to attract added attention.</p>
        <p>''Many of the artists that always show in one gallery or one neighborhood have an opportunity to showcase in another neighborhood,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons's gallery, which would be a participant, is a testament to the range of his interests and to the resources at his disposal. The Corridor Art Gallery takes its name from its entranceway, a corridor that has a mean echo and, for now, is decorated with drawings of Barbie and Ken dolls in compromising positions and various states of undress and decapitation.</p>
        <p>Where public gallery space ends and private living space begins, things get far more cluttered, with African sculptures, musical instruments, paintings and action figures in their boxes hanging from the walls. Even the bathroom counter is covered with small plastic toys.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons does not display his own paintings. Works in progress are relegated to a back room, under a skylight and the inattentive watch of a friendly but sleepy old Russian wolfhound named Trotsky.</p>
        <p>No hip-hop paraphernalia is displayed, either.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simmons, said Elissa Blount-Moorhead, the executive director of Red Clay Arts, a gallery to which Mr. Simmons has provided space, ''has become sort of a beacon for artists in Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>But his family connections, she said, are beside the point.</p>
        <p>''You know the art world,'' she said. ''They don't care about that stuff. You have to get your own rep.''</p>
