        <p>Directed by Steve Hanft  Not rated, 80 minutes</p>
        <p>Steven Hanft's sardonic rock 'n' roll comedy, ''Southlander: Diary of a Desperate Musician,'' about a young guy trying desperately to retrieve a stolen synthesizer, is the cinematic equivalent of a cheesy riff on a $50 electronic keyboard. On paper at least the hip credentials of the movie, whose cast includes Beck and Beth Orton in minor roles, appear unassailable. But this poorly acted, ramshackle tour of the lower echelons of the Los Angeles rock scene has the feel of a largely improvised home movie filmed without retakes, and its sense of humor could only be fully appreciated by struggling musicians.</p>

        <p>Steven Hanft's sardonic rock 'n' roll comedy, ''Southlander: Diary of a Desperate Musician,'' about a young guy trying desperately to retrieve a stolen synthesizer, is the cinematic equivalent of a cheesy riff on a $50 electronic keyboard. On paper at least the hip credentials of the movie, whose cast includes Beck and Beth Orton in minor roles, appear unassailable. But this poorly acted, ramshackle tour of the lower echelons of the Los Angeles rock scene has the feel of a largely improvised home movie filmed without retakes, and its sense of humor could only be fully appreciated by struggling musicians.</p>
        <p>The central character of the film, which opens today in Manhattan, is Chance (Rory Cochrane), an out-of-work keyboardist who stumbles upon a rarity, a 1969 Moletron synthesizer that makes a particularly spacey sound. Because of that sound, a band that has repeatedly rejected him does an about-face and welcomes him as a member. But shortly after purchasing the instrument at a bargain price (he trades sexual favors with the elephantine saleswoman for the discount), it is stolen from the back of his car.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the movie Chance, sometimes accompanied by his equally desperate best friend, Ross Angeles (Rossie Harris), pursues leads through advertisements placed in The Southlander, a Los Angeles classified paper for musicians. Chance's search takes him to the home of a gun-toting fallen funk star, Motherchild (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), creator of the classic album ''Butter Jive,'' who lives with a cocaine-snorting airhead known as Snow Bunny. Motherchild is given to spouting portentous nonsense, like ''You are not your body, and you are not your mind, because you are the one who's observing them.''</p>
        <p>Chance's search also takes him to the solar-powered house of Lane Windbird (Gregg Henry), an eccentric New Age composer who collects obsolete electric instruments only to destroy them in giant bonfires. Chance ends up at the cluttered lair of a country singer, Hank III (Hank Williams III), whose junkyard includes a flame-spewing mechanical dinosaur that can pick up and crush a car.</p>
        <p>If ''Southlander'' has the seeds of a workable rock-culture satire, it's too fragmentary and too devoted to its self-referential ethos to transcend its insular vision of rock's lunatic fringe.</p>
