        <p>A powerful earthquake shook northern Japan early this morning, causing power failures, setting fire to an oil refinery and derailing a train.</p>
        <p>At least 164 people were injured, most of them by falling objects in their homes, according to the NHK news network. No deaths were reported.</p>
        <p>Japan's National Meteorological Agency warned residents away from coastal areas, for fear that aftershocks would bring ocean waves, known as tsunamis. There were no immediate reports of widespread damage.</p>
        <p>The quake, with a magnitude of 8.0, struck at 4:50 a.m. in the Pacific Ocean about 50 miles off the southeastern coast of Hokkaido, Japan's northern island, about 600 miles north of Tokyo, according to the agency. Aftershocks, including a powerful one at 6:07 a.m., followed.</p>
        <p>NHK showed images of shelves shaking furiously inside an office, a fresh crack running up an asphalt road and a fire burning at a refinery in southern Hokkaido.</p>
        <p>Train service was suspended on Hokkaido after an express train derailed, injuring one of the 39 passengers, according to Kyodo News.</p>
        <p>In a fishing town called Samani, two small fishing boats capsized off the coast; in another town, Erimo, whose 2,200 residents were told to evacuate at 5 a.m., waves swept empty cars into the sea. In Kushiro, a southeastern city hit by high waves, 24,300 houses were left without power, according to Kyodo.</p>
        <p>Hiroaki Tanaka, a fire official in Kushiro, on Hokkaido's east coast, said in an interview with Reuters that 47 people were being treated at hospitals in the city.</p>
        <p>''The situation seems to be settling down,'' he said. ''Aftershocks seem to be lessening. Injuries could rise though, if people head to hospitals in their own cars. We felt it shake for a very long time.''</p>
        <p>Television pictures showed a fire and smoke billowing near an oil storage depot of the Idemitsu Kosan Company at a refinery in Tomakomai, a coastal city in southern Hokkaido.</p>
        <p>The company said it had closed the plant for safety reasons.</p>
        <p>Other pictures showed cracks in buildings and fallen tiles, and items spilled from supermarket shelves.</p>
        <p>Japan, which sits atop four tectonic plates, is one of the world's most seismically active countries, and tremors are regularly felt here. Last Saturday afternoon, a quake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, originating in the Pacific off Tokyo, jolted the capital.</p>
        <p>Hokkaido, with a population of about five million, is sparsely inhabited compared to the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>Japan's last major earthquake occurred in Kobe in 1995. That tremor, which measured 7.2, killed more than 6,000 people.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 18, 2003, Saturday  A map on Sept. 26 with an article about an earthquake in northern Japan mislabeled the ownership of the Kurile Islands. Although Russian-administered, they have been regarded internationally as disputed territory since they were occupied at the end of World War II.</p>
