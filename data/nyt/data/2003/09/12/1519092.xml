        <p>A 15-year-old boy accused of planning a killing rampage in Oaklyn with two other teenagers will be tried as an adult, a judge ruled yesterday in Camden County Superior Court. Cody Jackson, left, and his companions were arrested on July 6, carrying an assortment of firearms and more than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, and Mr. Jackson now faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder, carjacking and aggravated assault by pointing a weapon. Defense lawyers had said Mr. Jackson should be tried as a juvenile, contending that he was pressured into the plot by 18-year-old Matthew Lovett and pointing out that the defendants surrendered without firing a shot. Judge Louis F. Hornstine said that trying Mr. Jackson in adult court could deter other teens from similar behavior. If convicted, Mr. Jackson could face more than 40 years in prison.</p>
