        <p>STOCKHOLM: CENSURING OPRAH -- An Oprah Winfrey talk show has drawn censure from Sweden's broadcasting watchdog, the Swedish Broadcasting Commission. The agency said the show betrayed bias toward a United States attack on Iraq, Reuters reported yesterday. ''Different views were expressed, but all longer remarks gave voice to the opinion that Saddam Hussein was a threat to the United States and should be the target of attack,'' the commission said. Annelie Ulfhielm, a commission official, said the censure meant that TV4, a Swedish television network, must publish the decision but that it is not subject to legal or financial penalties. The show was broadcast in February. Sweden's government opposed the invasion of Iraq, which began in March. A TV4 spokesman told Reuters that Ms. Winfrey's show usually drew an audience of 100,000 to 140,000, making it one of Sweden's most popular daytime offerings.</p>

        <p>MUSIC: POP POST-MORTEM -- The final albums by Warren Zevon and Johnny Cash have been rising on the pop charts since their deaths. For the week that ended Sept. 14, according to data issued by Nielsen SoundScan and reported by Reuters, ''The Wind'' by Mr. Zevon leaped 28 places to No. 12, and Mr. Cash's Grammy Award-winning ''American IV: The Man Comes Around'' ascended 72 places to No. 22. Mr. Zevon died on Sept. 7, Mr. Cash on Sept. 12.</p>
        <p>ST. LOUIS: MUSEUM'S NEW HOME -- A new home for the Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis opens tomorrow with a ribbon-cutting and inaugural gala benefit that usher in a weekendlong celebration. Adjacent to Tadao Ando's building, above, for the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts, the 27,000-square-foot Contemporary Art Museum, designed by Brad Cloepfil of Allied Works Architecture, nearly quadruples the museum's existing space. It includes three galleries; a multimedia, performance and lecture space; a lab and education center; a lobby; a courtyard; a cafe; and a bookshop. The opening exhibition in the museum, continuing through Jan. 3, is ''A Fiction of Authenticity: Contemporary Africa Abroad.''</p>

The concerts, at 8 tonight and Saturday night in Alice Tully Hall, are the first collaborations of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra with a foreign big band.</p>
        <p>FILM: SILENT NIGHTS -- Taking its cue and its content from the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in Italy, BAMcin√©matek at the Brooklyn Academy of Music will present a weekend of silent films, beginning at 7:30 tonight. The opening attraction of the Pordenone Silent Film Weekend is the United States premiere of a restored print of ''Once Upon a Time'' (1922), Carl Theodore Dreyer's tale of a Danish prince who tries to woo a princess by appearing to her in disguise. At 7:30 tomorrow night ''Treasures From a Chest'' will present films from a trove, some unscreened for more than 90 years.</p>
        <p>ART: THE KENNEDY EFFECT -- What was the impact of the presidency of John F. Kennedy on American and European artists and their work? An answer will be delivered, beginning on Saturday, when more than 40 paintings (including a James Wyeth portrait, detail at right), sculptures, drawings and photographs assembled from public and private collections worldwide go on view at the Bruce Museum of Arts and Science in Greenwich, Conn. Coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963, ''JFK and Art'' includes works by Pablo Picasso, Norman Rockwell, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. The exhibition, billed as the first to examine artists' responses to Kennedy will close on Jan. 11. It will be seen from Feb. 2 through May 2 at the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
        <p>ART: INDIAN BASKETS -- More than 200 of the finest baskets from the collection of the National Museum of the American Indian will go on view there on Saturday. The exhibition, ''The Language of Native American Baskets,'' focuses on the weavers' points of view and emphasizes the process of making the baskets. The exhibition in the museum, at 1 Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan, continues through Jan. 9.</p>
