        <p>The war of the handbag was the fashion event of the summer. Lawyers for the big logos were busy chasing copyists, but the imitators were like the incoming tide. Meanwhile, women were delighted with the season's whimsical purses, like the boot bags, far left, by Shoshanna Smith, a New York artisan. Wallets were also stuffed into soft plastic watering cans, backpacks shaped like bugs and totes resembling shoes. The occasional real Chanel with sketches of Coco Chanel, top right, was far outnumbered by Audrey Hepburns and Marilyn Monroes purchased from sidewalk vendors.</p>

        <p>The fun began a year ago, when Louis Vuitton had its logo bag recolored by Takashi Murakami, the Japanese pop artist (above with Phyllis Tuchman, who holds a version, at an opening of his street sculptures last Tuesday at Rockefeller Center). Copies -- and litigation -- sprouted last spring on Canal Street, while Vuitton clients waited months for the original. Herm√®s lawyers spent the summer trying to block Italian-made rubber spoofs of its Birkin bag, below right; most of the triumphant bearers of the must-have jelly in New York were Americans returning from Italy. By mid-August Vuitton's monogrammed tote, below left, led the pack.</p>
