        <p>THE Francophilia of Theresa K. Dilworth, a new North Fork producer, seems as pronounced as the French tricolor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dilworth's vineyard is called Le Clos Thérèse (in France, a clos is an enclosed vineyard). Her brand is Comtesse Thérèse. And St.-Emilion's main grape is central to her first major releases, three merlots.</p>
        <p>She began planting a 10-acre vineyard, at Union Avenue and Route 105 in Aquebogue, in 2000. It consists of seven acres of cabernet sauvignon, two of merlot and some orange muscat intended for semidry and dessert wines. The agriculture is mostly organic, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dilworth's merlots -- solid, intensely flavorful reds -- only hint at her stylistic ambitions, because the fruit was bought elsewhere on the East End.</p>
        <p>Once all her grapes are farmed under her full control, she can more thoroughly define the Comtesse Thérèse wine style. The hands-on winemaking is done by others at the Premium Wine Group, a custom-production winery in Mattituck.</p>
        <p>The first indications are positive. Ms. Dilworth's 2001 Hungarian Oak Merlot ($15) -- full of dark fruits, almost sweet, agreeably woody -- shows hints of lead pencil and licorice.</p>
        <p>Her 2001 Traditional Merlot ($18; half bottle $10) is heavily concentrated, smooth, boldly flavorsome and smoky. It needs a beef dish to soften its firm tannins.</p>
        <p>Her best wine is the aromatic 2001 Chateau Reserve Merlot ($25): smooth, silky and plush. Look for flavors of dark fruits (some cabernet has been added), hints of chocolate in the aroma, and licorice and cinnamon notes in the taste.</p>
        <p>All possess more depth than their youth lets them display; a year more in the bottle will unlock the nuances. Decant them now.</p>
        <p>In addition, a virtually dry 2001 merlot rosé ($14), with a tea-rose bouquet, is berryish and amiable.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dilworth, a 42-year-old tax lawyer for Pfizer in Manhattan, is the principal owner; two Japanese businesswomen in Tokyo are partners.</p>
        <p>In 2004, Ms. Dilworth plans to release about 100 cases of 2002 cabernet, which was made from purchased North Fork grapes and is now being aged in French oak.</p>
        <p>She also has a 2002 barrel-fermented chardonnay maturing in Russian oak and expects to make a 2003 barrel-fermented chardonnay, all from North Fork grapes.</p>
        <p>Overall, about 600 cases of the 2001's were made; 800 cases of the 2002's are unreleased; 2,000 cases are projected by 2006.</p>
        <p>The merlots and rosé can be found at the Tasting Room, 2885 Peconic Lane, Peconic. Sales information: (631)765-6404.</p>
