        <p>Times are Eastern. All times and dates are subject to change.</p>
        <p>September</p>
        <p>WHOOPI -- Whoopi Goldberg tries the sit-com format, though perhaps formula would be a better word. Her character owns a boutique hotel in Manhattan and has plenty of opportunities for sardonic asides, thanks to her oddball supporting players: a brother whose much younger, white girlfriend is teaching him hip-hop lingo, and an Iranian concierge who seems to bring out the xenophobia in everyone. He's played by Omid Djalili, and he's got a chance to become a breakout character. NBC, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. beginning this week.</p>

        <p>September</p>
        <p>WHOOPI -- Whoopi Goldberg tries the sit-com format, though perhaps formula would be a better word. Her character owns a boutique hotel in Manhattan and has plenty of opportunities for sardonic asides, thanks to her oddball supporting players: a brother whose much younger, white girlfriend is teaching him hip-hop lingo, and an Iranian concierge who seems to bring out the xenophobia in everyone. He's played by Omid Djalili, and he's got a chance to become a breakout character. NBC, Tuesdays at 8 p.m. beginning this week.</p>
        <p>HAPPY FAMILY -- A comedy that revels in its adherence to the traditional set-up joke, something that hasn't worked for quite a while. John Larroquette and Christine Baranski were around when it did, and they star now as a couple happy to see their grown children move out -- and sorry to learn how messed up they are. (Amusingly enough, the younger son is having a secret affair with the older woman next door). NBC, Tuesdays at 8:30 beginning this week.</p>
        <p>JAKE 2.0 -- A young computer nerd (Christopher Gorham) is accidentally infused with something called nanites, which are bits of computer intelligence. Naturally this gives him super powers. The government likes that, and soon he's fighting for truth, justice and the American way. It's about artificial intelligence, but surprisingly, it actually is intelligent -- a bit, anyway. UPN, Wednesdays at 9 beginning this week.</p>
        <p>STEVE HARVEY'S BIG TIME -- A throwback of sorts: a weekly variety show, though here the emphasis will be on the silly as much as on the talented. WB, Thursdays at 8 beginning this week.</p>
        <p>RUN OF THE HOUSE -- A comedy about a teenage girl: who would expect that from WB? In this one the heroine, played by Margo Harshman, is being raised by her three 20-something siblings. WB, Thursdays at 9:30 beginning this week.</p>
        <p>CARNIVALE -- The latest idiosyncratic drama from HBO, a fable about a small-time traveling carnival in the Dust Bowl during the 1930's, complete with bearded ladies, blind mind readers and little people -- not to mention a lot of mysterious and apparently supernatural goings-on in a strange small town, certain to be visited by the carny folk down the line. Any fan of David Lynch will surely feel at home. It stars Nick Stahl. HBO, Sundays at 9; premiere is next Sunday at 9:30.</p>
        <p>K STREET -- At the opposite end of the spectrum, an up-to-the minute comedy-drama-reality series about the mad, mad world of political consultants that mixes actors like Mary McCormack and John Slattery with real-life political types like James Carville, Mary Matalin and Michael Deaver. With a pedigreed production team led by George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh. HBO, Sundays at 10; premiere is next Sunday at 10:30.</p>
        <p>PEPSI'S PLAY FOR A BILLION -- That's with a ''B.'' This game show with escalating prizes truly tries to up the ante, even if it's for one night only. There could be a payday fit for a Gates, but Pepsi is getting a night of big-time promotion for its efforts. Produced by Michael Davies, the maestro behind ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' WB, next Sunday at 8.</p>
        <p>THE I DO DIARIES: MARRY ME NOW -- Another reality show that surely sounded great when it was pitched to programmers: a man asks a woman to marry him after six years of courtship; the hitch is that she has to agree to get it done in four hours, and hold the wedding in a five-story inflatable chapel. How's that for realism? Lifetime, next Sunday at 11.</p>
        <p>EVE -- A comedy built around the appeal of the hip-hop artist Eve (though she's playing a girl named Shelly), who pursues relationships with the help of a duo of friends. The main love interest is played by Jason George. UPN, Mondays at 8:30 beginning Sept. 15.</p>
        <p>ALL OF US -- Full of heart, if not laughs, it's an African-American family comedy ''inspired'' by the lives of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, who are also the executive producers. Robert, an entertainment reporter in Hollywood (Duane Martin) is madly in love with Tia (Elise Neal), a sexy kindergarten teacher, but he must extricate himself from his marriage to the narcissistic Neesee (LisaRaye), who is also the mother of his cute 5-year-old son. UPN, Tuesdays at 8:30 beginning Sept. 16.</p>
        <p>THE MULLETS -- A comedy based on a hairstyle. Two slobby brothers sport the do, and party hearty, under the warm maternal gaze of Mom -- played by Loni Anderson (remember when she was a sex symbol?) -- whose husband is a square game-show host. He does not sport a mullet. UPN, beginning Thursday at 9:30, then moving to its regular time on Tuesdays at 9:30.</p>
        <p>SURVIVOR: PEARL ISLANDS -- Reality's most potent early format receives a real test of its durability. This edition, the seventh, features yet another new group America has to take to its heart ( they're on an island off of Panama); while looming in early 2004 is the eighth edition, with an all-star cast chosen from the show's earlier seasons. CBS, Thursdays at 8 beginning Sept. 18.</p>
        <p>LIKE FAMILY -- Reversing the old plot where a black kid is dropped into a white home, this comedy has a white single mom move in with the boisterous African-American family of her best friend. Holly Robinson Peete plays the friend; Diane Farr is the single mom. WB, Fridays at 8:30 beginning Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>LUIS -- The networks, which have clearly discovered that many Hispanics watch TV, are trying not one but two new Hispanic sitcoms. This one stars Luis Guzman and is about a harried, if not exactly humorous, doughnut shop owner. Fox, Fridays at 8:30 beginning Sept. 19.</p>
        <p>DATE PATROL -- More cable reality. A makeover show in which experts advise those unlucky in love on how to score. TLC, Saturdays at 10 beginning Sept. 20.</p>
        <p>LAS VEGAS -- Behind the scenes with the security boss for a huge casino (James Caan) and his young aide, played by Josh Duhamel, who is also the lover of the boss's daughter. Colors, cards and dice fly by in a rush. NBC, Mondays at 9 beginning Sept. 22 (premiere episode at 10).</p>
        <p>TWO AND A HALF MEN -- A big test of recent trends. Comedy isn't supposed to work anymore, and one of this show's stars, Jon Cryer, has failed in a long line of previous shows (''The Famous Teddy Z,''  ''Partners,''  ''Getting Personal,''  ''The Trouble With Normal''). But it's both funny and well-placed. The real star is Charlie Sheen as a swinging bachelor whose life changes when he is forced to take in the up-tight Mr. Cryer and his 11-year-old son, who have been dumped by the wife and mother. With its excellent time period (following ''Everybody Loves Raymond''), this looks like a favorite for strongest new comedy of the season. CBS, Mondays at 9:30 beginning Sept. 22.</p>
        <p>NAVY NCIS -- Something out of a Conan O'Brien ''if they mated'' sketch: what you get when you marry ''J.A.G.'' with ''C.S.I.'' Forensic investigators in the Navy, in a down-the-middle television drama starring Mark Harmon. CBS, Tuesdays at 8 beginning Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>I'M WITH HER -- The premise of ''Notting Hill'' transferred to a sit-com. A decidedly unfamous schoolteacher meets cute with a fab movie star (her dog takes a bite out of the back of his jeans) and romance ensues. The pilot manages to move the story all the way through the plot of ''Notting Hill,'' leaving questions about what's left for the series. The season's second-best title, though (after ''Joan of Arcadia''). David Sutcliffe is ''I'm'' and Teri Polo is ''Her.'' ABC, Tuesdays at 8:30 beginning Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>HOW DO YOU SPELL MURDER -- A documentary about the startling number of illiterate men in the New Jersey State Prison and a literacy program started by the inmates themselves. From Alan and Susan Raymond (''An American Family''). Cinemax, Sept. 24 at 7.</p>
        <p>THE BROTHERHOOD OF POLAND, N.H. -- The latest quirky drama from David E. Kelley, which should challenge conventional assumptions about television stardom: it's about three balding fat guys in their 40's. They run the small New England town they grew up in, and still team for hockey, while their wives struggle to find meaning in their lives. The stars include Randy Quaid and Mare Winningham. CBS, Wednesdays at 10 beginning Sept. 24.</p>
        <p>COUPLING -- Copied from the British hit, it's sure to be the season's most-talked-about new show, purely because of its own talk, which is unrestrainedly about sex and, well, coupling. The structure is ''Friends''-like: a group of 30-ish singles in Chicago exploring relationships, with lots of multiple formations and entendres. The cast includes Rena Sofer, Sonya Walger and Colin Ferguson. NBC, Thursdays at 9:30 beginning Sept. 25 (premiere episode at 9:15).</p>
        <p>JOAN OF ARCADIA -- Perhaps the most offbeat premise for any show this season, though the execution is more conventional. Sixteen-year-old Joan meets people daily who say they are God and direct her to take actions that change lives. Meanwhile, her dad, a cop, deals with darker events. Joe Mantegna and Mary Steenburgen play the parents; young Amber Tamblyn is a star in the making as Joan. CBS, Fridays at 8 beginning Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>MISS MATCH -- A vehicle intended to make Alicia Silverstone a TV star, and it might. She gets to interact cutely with other young people as a matchmaker while pursuing her day job as a divorce lawyer. The tone is light but not necessarily comedic, and nothing at all like the other current show from its creator, Darren Star -- ''Sex and the City.'' NBC, Fridays at 8 beginning Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>HOPE AND FAITH -- Kelly Ripa is out to conquer the world, or at least TV. While continuing as cohost of her morning show with Regis Philbin, she stars in this sitcom, a broad family farce in which she plays Faith, a recently fired soap opera diva who moves in, and meddles, with the family of her sister, Hope (who is played by a Faith, in this case Ford). The show is the centerpiece of ABC's revived T.G.I.F. franchise. ABC, Fridays at 9 beginning Sept. 26.</p>
        <p>CIRCUS -- A convoluted British crime drama about a couple of con artists going for one last score to set themselves up for life. The exceptional cast includes Famke Janssen and John Hannah as the couple, with Eddie Izzard as a sadistic loan shark. BBC America, Sept. 27 at 8.</p>
        <p>THE BOYS OF 2ND STREET PARK -- A touching, resonant look back at a lost era in New York, the days when a group of boys would band together around a playground basketball rim and plot to change the world. The men who look back in this award-winning documentary (which was made by one of them, the public-relations executive Dan Klores) carry memories of high school wins and losses, of music, culture shock, drug excesses and the loves of their lives. Showtime, Sept. 28  at 8.</p>
        <p>COLD CASE -- More crime process from the Jerry Bruckheimer production factory (''C.S.I.,''  ''Without a Trace''). A young Philadelphia detective, on the outs with the department hierarchy, goes after long-unsolved cases. The police work is less scientific and more shoe-leathery than in the other crime-solving shows, which puts more of an onus on the star, Kathryn Morris. CBS, Sundays at 8 beginning Sept. 28.</p>
        <p>THE BLUES -- An ambitious series of seven films from renowned directors on various topics in the world of blues music. The project's executive producer is Martin Scorsese, who also directs the first film. Other directors include Wim Wenders, Richard Pearce, Mike Figgis and Clint Eastwood. PBS, beginning Sept. 28 at 9.</p>
        <p>THE LYON'S DEN -- A chance for Rob Lowe to prove that he's the leading man he believed he was going to be on ''West Wing'' (until Martin Sheen showed up). Here Mr. Lowe plays a devoted pro bono lawyer forced to take the reins of an establishment Washington firm filled with dark secrets and scheming rivals. NBC, Sundays at 10 beginning Sept. 28.</p>
        <p>October</p>
        <p>IT'S ALL RELATIVE -- Another example of the growing acceptance of gay-themed shows, though the quality may test some people's tolerance. A couple wants to marry; her parents are two gay men, his are a hidebound Boston-Irish couple who own a bar. Insults and stereotypes fly. The cast includes Lenny Clarke, Harriet Sansom-Harris and John Benjamin Hickey. ABC, Wednesdays at 8:30 beginning Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>KAREN SISCO -- A stylish crime drama about a young, female United States marshal who works the Gold Coast of Florida. Based on the film ''Out of Sight,'' with Carla Guigino in the J. Lo role. The cast also includes Robert Forster and Peter Horton. ABC, Wednesdays at 10 beginning Oct. 1.</p>
        <p>TARZAN -- A show that asks the question: can a famous muscleman be played by a guy named Fimmel? Using the same TV magic with which it turned Superman into a teenage hero, WB rejuvenates Tarzan. He moves to New York and meets a love interest named Jane Porter, played by Sarah Wayne Callies. Travis Fimmel, famous from posing in his Calvins, makes the shift to loincloths. WB, Sundays at 9 beginning Oct. 5.</p>
        <p>EXTREME HISTORY WITH ROGER DALTREY -- How people did all the amazing things they did in the past, with an emphasis on American history, like buffalo hunting, the War of 1812 and the Civil War. The lead singer of the Who, apparently a history buff, throws himself into these adventures. History Channel, Sundays at 10:30 beginning Oct. 5.</p>
        <p>KNEE HIGH P.I. -- Which came first, the title or the plot? In Comedy Central's original movie, a little person named Hank Dingo has a talent for solving crimes, if he can be taken seriously, which, since this is a comedy, he can't. Martin Klebba had the prerequisites for the part. Comedy Central, Oct. 12 at 10.</p>
        <p>SKIN -- Romeo is the son of a Los Angeles district attorney, Juliet is the daughter of a porn king. When they get together, a family feud ensues, against the backdrop of the seamy world of pornography. Ron Silver is the entrepreneur; Kevin Anderson is the D.A. The kids are played by D. J. Controna and Olivia Wilde. Fox, Mondays at 9 beginning Oct. 20.</p>
        <p>TERROR IN MOSCOW -- An extraordinary inside look at the storming of a Moscow theater by Chechen rebels, which led to a 57-hour siege and then a rescue that left many hostages dead. Assembled from interviews with survivors, evidence gathered by police and even extensive film shot by one of the hostage-takers. It will be shown on the first anniversary of the event. HBO, Oct. 23 at 7.</p>
        <p>CAMBRIDGE SPIES -- A dramatic recounting of the college friendships that blossomed into the biggest spy scandal of the cold war. The series traces the story of Anthony Blunt, Guy Burgess, Kim Philby and Donald Maclean, who turned political activism into traitorous betrayal, from their meeting in 1934 through World War II, the cold war and their eventual discovery. Toby Stephens, Tom Hollander, Samuel West and Rupert Penry-Jones are the stars. BBC America, Saturdays at 10 beginning Oct. 25.</p>
        <p>A MINUTE WITH STAN HOOPER -- Can a comedy succeed on the Fox network if it has strong joke-writing and a solid adult cast with nary a teenager in sight? This show will provide the test case. Norm McDonald plays a TV journalist who looks to return to America's heartland, and regular folk, and finds himself surrounded by more oddballs than you'd see on an average Manhattan street corner. Also starring Penelope Ann Miller and Fred Willard. Fox, Wednesdays at 8:30 beginning Oct. 29.</p>
        <p>TRU CALLING -- One of several new series with supernatural themes, this one is a stylish thriller about a young female doctor who works in the city morgue and finds murder victims talking to her -- and allowing her to go back in time to try to save them. Eliza Dushku is the star. Fox, Thursdays at 8 beginning Oct. 30.</p>
        <p>November</p>
        <p>THE ORTEGAS -- In the British version (''The Kumars''), the family is Indian, but the idea is the same. The son in a Hispanic family begins a talk show in his house, with his family members as guests. Soon real celebrities start dropping in, though they have no idea what's going on. The celebrity interviews are improvised while the family material is scripted. It sounds funny, anyway. Cheech Marin is the dad and Al Madrigal is the son/host. Fox, Sundays at 8:30 beginning Nov. 2.</p>
        <p>DR. ZHIVAGO -- The movie may be distant enough for a TV remake to work. This installment of ''Masterpiece Theater,'' with a script by Andrew Davies, promises to stick closer to the Pasternak novel. Hans Matheson is the tormented doctor-poet; Keira Knightley, fresh from two film triumphs (''Bend It Like Beckham'' and ''Pirates of the Caribbean'') is his great love, Lara; Sam Neill is the slimy Komarovsky. PBS, Nov. 2 and Nov. 9 at 9.</p>
        <p>ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT -- Surely the most original new comedy of the season, though it may have borrowed a lot of its originality from ''The Royal Tenenbaums.'' A rich, corrupt family is forced to ask its one honest member, played by Jason Bateman, to take over the business when Dad goes to jail. The cast includes Jessica Walter, Portia DiRossi and David Cross. Fox, Sundays at 9:30 beginning Nov. 2.</p>
        <p>D.C. SNIPER: 23 DAYS OF TERROR -- The events from the viewpoint of Charles Moose, who led the investigation and had to quit his job to sell his story. Charles S. Dutton stars. USA, Nov. 14 at 8.</p>
        <p>J.F.K. -- One of many remembrances on the 40th anniversary of the assassination, this three-hour documentary looks at John F. Kennedy's career, incorporating newly declassified material like health records and dictaphone recordings. History Channel, Nov. 16 at 8.</p>
        <p>December</p>
        <p>ANGELS IN AMERICA -- An epic movie version of the epic Pulitzer Prize-winning plays by Tony Kushner. Two parts (''The Millennium Approaches'' the first week, ''Perestroika'' the second week) of three hours each, with one-hour segments shown on the nights in between. At a cost of more than $60 million, it was directed by Mike Nichols and has one of the highest-profile casts ever assembled for a television production: Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, Emma Thompson, Jeffrey Wright, Mary-Louise Parker, Michael Gambon, Simon Callow and many more. HBO, beginning Dec. 7.</p>
        <p>BATTLESTAR GALACTICA -- A remake of one of the most expensive flops in television history, which for some reason is fondly remembered. It ran for less than two years on ABC, starting in 1978, and starred such luminaries as Lorne Greene and Richard Hatch. Sued by the makers of ''Star Wars'' for its shameless copying, it was popular only with children, but now they're grown up and presumably still interested enough to make a cable channel happy. The stars are Edward James Olmos and Mary McDonnell. Sci-Fi, December.</p>
        <p>2004</p>
        <p>STEPHEN KING'S KINGDOM HOSPITAL -- In one of the bolder scheduling gambits of the season, ABC will trot out its latest mini-series from Mr. King, who has scored repeatedly for the network in the past, on Thursday nights -- an evening totally dominated by CBS and NBC. The story (based on Lars von Trier's Danish mini-series ''The Kingdom'') is about the horror that slowly overtakes a hospital in New England. ABC, February.</p>
