        <p>The Royal National Theater in London yesterday announced a three-year $1.35-million deal with two American producers that gives them the first right to transfer the National's shows to the United States.</p>
        <p>The deal between the National Theater, one of the premier cultural institutions in the world, and the two producers -- Bob Boyett and Ostar Productions, run by Bill Haber -- reflects the increasing popularity of partnerships between commercial producers and subsidized theater companies, the unflagging interest among American theater producers in all things British, and a new direction for the National, which recently changed leadership.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Royal National Theater in London yesterday announced a three-year $1.35-million deal with two American producers that gives them the first right to transfer the National's shows to the United States.</p>
        <p>The deal between the National Theater, one of the premier cultural institutions in the world, and the two producers -- Bob Boyett and Ostar Productions, run by Bill Haber -- reflects the increasing popularity of partnerships between commercial producers and subsidized theater companies, the unflagging interest among American theater producers in all things British, and a new direction for the National, which recently changed leadership.</p>
        <p>Soon after taking over as the new director of the National Theater six months ago, Nicholas Hytner started looking for partnerships with American producers. ''We thought it was a good idea that when we had a show for American audiences that we had a quick, direct and well-trodden path,'' Mr. Hytner said. ''We liked Bob and Bill because, to be blunt, we couldn't find anyone on Broadway with a bad word to say about them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyett has a long list of television and Broadway credits that includes stage dramas like ''The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?'' by Edward Albee and ''Topdog/Underdog'' as well as television shows like ''Family Matters'' and ''Full House.'' Besides being a founding member of Creative Artists Agency, Mr. Haber, president of Ostar, was a co-producer of ''Proof'' and ''The Scarlet Pimpernel.'' What does this deal mean for American audiences? More National imports, Mr. Boyett said. The first could be Michael Frayn's raved-about new drama, ''Democracy,'' and the revival of Tom Stoppard's ''Jumpers.'' (The only production excluded from the agreement is ''Jerry Springer: The Opera,'' which already has American producers.)</p>
        <p>''After seeing their season, which is really exciting, we could bring three plays a year,'' Mr. Boyett said. Only one National production, ''Vincent in Brixton,'' transferred to the United States last season.</p>
        <p>For skeptics wary of the partnership's bringing a commercial taint to the National's programming, Mr. Hytner was definite that he would not be in discussion with Mr. Boyett and Mr. Haber about his choices of repertory. ''We are the National Theater of Britain,'' he said, ''and it is our job to reflect our nation. It's Bill and Bob's job to use their intuition to choose which of these shows will be of interest in America.''</p>
        <p>Another sensitive issue is what happens to producers with longstanding relationships with National playwrights. They now must rely on an invitation from Mr. Boyett and Mr. Haber to join the team.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyett acknowledged the concern. ''I think that some producers have a sense of entitlement,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another Broadway producer, Emanuel Azenberg, said: ''It's a smart move by Boyett and Haber. They are now major players.'' Still, he said, ''if I'm Tom Stoppard I might not want to be locked in.''</p>
