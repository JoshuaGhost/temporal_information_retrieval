        <p>A recently finished portrait of former Gov. George Ryan, which is supposed to be added to the Hall of Governors in the Executive Mansion in Springfield, waits in limbo instead, because state officials are unsure how Mr. Ryan wants to unveil his likeness. Many governors opt for a formal ceremony in the Senate Chamber Room and sometimes a luncheon. But a federal investigation has resulted in several indictments against Mr. Ryan's top aides, and he has yet to give the state a directive.</p>

        <p>Correction:  September 25, 2003, Thursday  Because of an editing error, a report in the National Briefing column on Tuesday about the addition of a portrait of former Gov. George Ryan to the Illinois Hall of Governors misidentified the location. The hall is in the Capitol, not the executive mansion.</p>
