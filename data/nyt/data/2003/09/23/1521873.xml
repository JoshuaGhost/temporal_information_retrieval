        <p>Last week, the United Automobile Workers offered more concessions to the Big Three than it has in the last two decades of contract talks. Then again, concessions have not really been a feature of the last two decades of contract talks in the American auto industry.</p>
        <p>While auto workers see a contract that extends a lifeline to the struggling Big Three, Wall Street sees baby steps that amount to a glass half-full in some minds and fully empty in others.</p>
        <p>''Does this make the industry even a little bit more competitive? No,'' said Maryann Keller, an auto analyst and former executive who ran Priceline.com's automotive division.</p>
        <p>''This contract does nothing to even make a slight dent in the fundamental problems,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Stephen Girsky, an auto analyst at Morgan Stanley, said, ''You can say there's something in it for everyone, but you can also be a pessimist and say there's something in it for everyone not to like.''</p>
        <p>That the talks were wrapped up in unusually speedy fashion, with the union reaching an unprecedented five deals in five days with the Big Three and the supply giants Delphi and Visteon, was taken as a positive.</p>
        <p>Ron Gettelfinger, the union president, said ''one of our goals has been to bring this industry together.'' Auto executives, including the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, Rick Wagoner, praised Mr. Gettelfinger's ''professionalism.''</p>
        <p>The symbolic effect was the image of an industry and union on the same page, ready to tackle problems.</p>
        <p>To start, the lucrative United States market is facing overcapacity that is only expected to worsen as foreign competitors continue to build plants here. The Big Three want to close plants, but the last contract had an outright ban on closings, so G.M. started a price war that has kept plants running but sapped Big Three profits and done nothing to stem declines in market share. In August, the Big Three's market share hit a record low.</p>
        <p>Profitability has been a particular challenge for the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Group division of DaimlerChrysler. Ford lost $6.4 billion in 2001 and 2002 combined and is expecting a slim profit this year; Chrysler lost $1.1 billion in the second quarter but is also expecting a slight profit for the year.</p>
        <p>This ''profitless prosperity,'' as the Goldman Sachs analyst Gary Lapidus calls it, is coming during what is shaping up to be another year of go-go sales. ''The agreement does not address the root cause,'' he wrote in a recent report, adding ''we doubt the substance of the agreement is meaningfully positive for investors.''</p>
        <p>But he and other analysts do see some positives.</p>
        <p>For one, pension increases, a major liability for the Big Three, have been scaled back. Monthly benefits for retirees with 30 years of service will rise more than 10 percent over the four-year life of the contract, to $3,020 from $2,730, according to a summary of the contract with Chrysler provided to workers. That is less than the previous increase of roughly 17 percent.</p>
        <p>Second, instead of the 3 percent annual wage increases of the last contract, negotiated in 1999, workers will receive lump sums of roughly the same value in the first two years of the contract, a 2 percent increase in the third year and 3 percent raise in the fourth year.</p>
        <p>Lump sums are more palatable to management because they do not inflate base salaries, which are used to compute overtime, pension payments and future wage increases. Cost-of-living adjustments will also be reduced.</p>
        <p>On health care, co-payments for brand-name prescription drugs will rise to $10 from $5 for active workers. Co-payments for future retirees will also rise, to $5 from $2 -- but not for current retirees, which is the bulk of the Big Three's soaring health care burden and one not shared by foreign competitors.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a rip-off, having to pay money for our prescriptions,'' said Janet Buice, 40, a worker at a Ford plant in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Her husband Rick, 46, also works at the plant and did not agree.</p>
        <p>''It looks like a fair agreement, considering the economic times,'' he said. ''I think it's real fair.''</p>
        <p>Of course, many white-collar workers would love such concessions -- paying $10 for brand name drugs -- or salaries. The average Ford assembly worker made $70,206 in 2002, and the average skilled worker made more than $80,000.</p>
        <p>Such high labor costs have been a chief contributor to an exodus of 2.7 million manufacturing jobs over the last three years.</p>
        <p>Part of the trade-off is that the union is letting the Big Three close some plants this time. G.M. is expected to close a plant in Baltimore, Chrysler has plans to close or sell seven parts plants, and Ford will close four plants.</p>
        <p>Some analysts do not think the closings are substantial enough.</p>
        <p>''I think Gettelfinger did a great job for his members because he preserved a terrific package of wages and benefits and minimized job losses related to capacity closings,'' John Casesa, a Merrill Lynch analyst, said. ''You could easily make the case that far more capacity should have been eliminated.''</p>
        <p>For Ken Dearing, the president of U.A.W. local 325 in Hazelwood, Mo., last week was a good one. The union and Ford negotiated a deal that saves Ford's plant in Hazelwood, outside St. Louis, which makes the Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles. Instead, Ford will close a smaller van plant in Lorain, Ohio, west of Cleveland.</p>
        <p>''It bought us four years and a breath of life,'' he said. ''It's a very good contract for the economic times were in.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Keller said: ''It's shocking that Ford is not closing the St. Louis plant. They certainly need to take out a plant with more capacity than Lorain. They probably needed to take both of them down.''</p>
        <p>Eddie Guidicelli, 63, worked for the Lorain assembly plant for 33 years before retiring in 1996. The blow of closings, in the auto business, is largely not felt by retirees like him, or even current workers, whose benefits are protected and who usually have the option of transferring.</p>
        <p>But it means a loss of future jobs, for the country and the community.</p>
        <p>At the union hall late last week, after hearing the news reports of his old plant's demise, Mr. Guidicelli lamented that his grandson would not be able to work at the plant.</p>
        <p>''I was hoping he'd have a future here, but it's looking slim,'' he said.</p>
