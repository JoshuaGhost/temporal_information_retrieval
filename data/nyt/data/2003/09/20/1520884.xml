        <p>Nolan Hemmings, a son of the British actor David Hemmings, was last seen playing his father as a young man in ''Last Orders,'' the 2002 film with Michael Caine about a band of aging Englishmen on a journey to scatter the ashes of an old friend. Now the young Mr. Hemmings has the unenviable assignment of holding down the lead in ''The Petersburg-Cannes Express,'' a film of outstanding dullness and ineptitude that opened in New York on Friday.</p>
        <p>The producers released the film without showing it in advance to journalists, and it doesn't take long to discover why. Though written and directed by an Englishman, John Daly, a producer who was once the head of Britain's Hemdale Pictures, the film has been cast with many Russian actors in important roles, none of whom seem able to speak even the very basic English in which their lines have been written. Compounding matters, Mr. Daly seems to lack even a rudimentary ability to pose performers naturally in front of a camera; all those in St. Petersburg look embarrassed and uncertain, as if they have no idea what was being said to them, either.</p>

        <p>Nolan Hemmings, a son of the British actor David Hemmings, was last seen playing his father as a young man in ''Last Orders,'' the 2002 film with Michael Caine about a band of aging Englishmen on a journey to scatter the ashes of an old friend. Now the young Mr. Hemmings has the unenviable assignment of holding down the lead in ''The Petersburg-Cannes Express,'' a film of outstanding dullness and ineptitude that opened in New York on Friday.</p>
        <p>The producers released the film without showing it in advance to journalists, and it doesn't take long to discover why. Though written and directed by an Englishman, John Daly, a producer who was once the head of Britain's Hemdale Pictures, the film has been cast with many Russian actors in important roles, none of whom seem able to speak even the very basic English in which their lines have been written. Compounding matters, Mr. Daly seems to lack even a rudimentary ability to pose performers naturally in front of a camera; all those in St. Petersburg look embarrassed and uncertain, as if they have no idea what was being said to them, either.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemmings plays Alexie, a roguish revolutionary in the St. Petersburg of 1905. Alexie allows himself to be put in charge of a socialist plot to rescue Sophie, a Russian woman (Svetlana Lunkina) being held in a French prison for the assassination of a Russian judge. His plan: hop the Petersburg-Cannes Express, a luxury train fashioned from lace curtains and dark wood paneling, and kidnap the Czar's interior minister (Andris Lielais) on his way to take charge of the prisoner. He is helped in this imaginative scheme by Anna (Ksenia Alpherova), a coldly doctrinaire socialist who, to the surprise of no one who has ever seen a movie, thaws when faced by Alexie's irresistible charm.</p>
        <p>The St. Petersburg backgrounds look lovely, and they continue to look lovely even as the action reaches France, where we find the same provincial-looking train station we left behind, this time with a sign saying Cannes.</p>
        <p>''Vot haf I got to loose?'' asks Sophie when her liberators offer to take her home, a Molly Goldberg moment that evoked gales of laughter from both patrons at the film's premiere on Friday at the AMC 25 Theaters near Times Square.</p>
        <p>''The Petersburg-Cannes Express'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some mildly risqu√© fumbling in an upper berth.</p>
        <p>THE PETERSBURG-CANNES EXPRESS  Produced and directed by John Daly; written by Mr. Daly, based on the novel by Hans Koning; director of photography, Evgeniy Korzhenkov; edited by Gregory Plotkin; music by Igor Petrovich Khoroshev, with theme by Anna-Maria Miroliubova; production designer, Andrei Vassin; released by Miracle Entertainment/Prime Pictures. Running time: 100 minutes. This film is rated PG-13.</p>
        <p>WITH: Nolan Hemmings (Alexie), Ksenia Alpherova (Anna), Jay Benedict (Zidkin), Svetlana Lunkina (Sophie) and Andris Lielais (Drascovitch).</p>
