        <p>They are the most American of designers, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan, yet as the New York spring 2004 shows came to a close on Friday, neither lent their big voices, as one might have expected, to the strong American themes blowing through fashion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauren's clean take on the sporting life, from polo to cricket to fencing, certainly had American overtones. He offered smart-looking jackets in linen stripes with wide trousers and spectator stilettoes, and some novel variations on tennis sweaters, including a cardigan lacquered in paillettes and shown with a white mini polo dress. The close cut of the jackets, and the graphic punch of black and white, gave the day clothes a cool formality. And since this is the season of Fitzgerald, and Mr. Lauren contributed to the costumes for the film ''The Great Gatsby,'' one couldn't help seeing something of the athletic style of Jordan Baker in his clothes.</p>

        <p>They are the most American of designers, Ralph Lauren and Donna Karan, yet as the New York spring 2004 shows came to a close on Friday, neither lent their big voices, as one might have expected, to the strong American themes blowing through fashion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lauren's clean take on the sporting life, from polo to cricket to fencing, certainly had American overtones. He offered smart-looking jackets in linen stripes with wide trousers and spectator stilettoes, and some novel variations on tennis sweaters, including a cardigan lacquered in paillettes and shown with a white mini polo dress. The close cut of the jackets, and the graphic punch of black and white, gave the day clothes a cool formality. And since this is the season of Fitzgerald, and Mr. Lauren contributed to the costumes for the film ''The Great Gatsby,'' one couldn't help seeing something of the athletic style of Jordan Baker in his clothes.</p>
        <p>But the trouble with being Ralph Lauren is that he inevitably makes you demand more of him, especially at a time when there seems to be so much more about American style to comment upon than a cricket sweater (not exactly America's game, anyway). He, too, embraced color -- kiwi, orange, fuchsia -- but it came as a full-on attack and without a great deal of discernment, as if the need to be topical overran critical judgment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Karan drew upon earth tones, in tactile combinations of metallic linen and jersey, sometimes girt with wide leather belts. Jersey dresses looked sensual, and a jumpsuit in parachute silk came as a respite from too many jackets with sleeves pushed bossily over the elbows. But the proportions were jarring, and silk evening dresses in a chaotic basket weave tested comprehension.</p>
        <p>The live music for Tommy Hilfiger's show on Thursday was provided by N.E.R.D., but only a boob would wear the clothes as they were shown: Palm Beach tropical-print trousers and blazers for the guys and polo shirts and flight pants of fuchsia organza for the girls. You wanted to get the S.U.V. out and run them over a few times.</p>
        <p>This was fashion as a duty roster of street trends tweaked, as they say on Seventh Avenue, with glossy fabrics and suburban-safe sex appeal. There were beaded drawstring athletic pants, sundresses and skirts in candy stripes, and white taffeta dresses with pink grosgrain stripes down the side. But the colors had a sitcom brightness that neutralized the street vibe, making the clothes seem as banal as those hot-pink trench coats and black fedoras that a group of women wore as they handed out free copies of The Star outside the Bryant Park tents.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, Ralph Rucci couldn't fill the seats at his fashion shows, and the collective whir of the photographers' cameras didn't add up to a murmur. But since he began showing at the Paris couture, his reach has widened, and so has his audience. Among those at the show were Casey Ribicoff, who came with the literary agent Lynn Nesbit, and Deeda Blair, who flew up from Washington and is a relatively new client.</p>
        <p>What's different, too, is that Mr. Rucci has the confidence that comes to someone who, after years of being ignored, steps out and smells the air. He has gained as much from his belated success (and from listening to buyers, especially those at Neiman Marcus) as he has given to fashion.</p>
        <p>The superb collection he showed on Thursday, one of the best of the week, demonstrated that. When he was in contact only with his clients (he did have bills to pay, after all), his collections were somber, heavy-weather affairs, the respectful work of someone who glanced up at Balenciaga's portrait rather than out the window. Today the monkish dresses and the double-faced cashmere suits have been banished (at least to the showroom), and in their place is an ethereal lightness and a looser mentality.</p>
        <p>Poetic blouses of boiled white chiffon caught the mood of his July couture show, as did a black cocktail dress with a mesh bodice, discreetly inset with an apronlike panel over the bosom, and a teacup skirt of gazar. Feathers glazed hemlines, and insets of black patent leather were effective on black wool day dresses, throwing light on a dark ground. Mr. Rucci continues to bring more femininity to his clothes, a result of being exposed to different types of women, and also a seductive sense of play. A long A-line evening dress barely veiled the body and came frisked with tiny Parisian feathers.</p>
        <p>Zac Posen is in another age and income bracket, but the collection he showed on Thursday displayed grown-up finesse. He evidently took to heart criticism that his clothes lacked focus and sophistication, for he brought both to bear in skimmy dresses in charmeuse and silk jersey in sea tones like pale green, shell pink and lavender.</p>
        <p>Many of the dresses served up a goddess-on-a-half-shell quality, so he hasn't lost his childish wit, with ropes of charmeuse twisting around the neck in halter styles and long hemlines ruched and gathered into eccentric mermaid drapery. It was Mr. Posen's most polished performance to date.</p>
        <p>Several London designers crossed the pond this season. Once Roland Mouret got past the kinky sex-shop references and breast contraptions (an improbable blend, one, inferred from his show notes, of Walt Disney and the art director Jean-Paul Goude), he had something fresh to say with draped jersey tops and dresses clinging with delicious lewdness to the body. They conjured up the spent look of marathon dancers.</p>
        <p>Matthew Williamson sent out a low-key collection of striped knits and skinny white trousers, enlivened by soft skirts in peacock-tail prints and some lovely chiffon tunic dresses, butterflying from the waist. Prada has a peacock-print skirt out for this season, and several editors gave theirs an airing, proving that, in fashion, sometimes the déjà vu is the only view.</p>
