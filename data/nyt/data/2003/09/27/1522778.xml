        <p>In late October 2001, New York City child welfare officials faced a familiar, but difficult decision: whether or not to take Stephanie Warren's newborn from her.</p>
        <p>There were reasons for concern. All of Ms. Warren's five previous children had been taken away -- three given over to adoption, two others turned over to the custody of their father. The mother also had a history of arrests -- including for prostitution -- going back two decades, and the baby had tested positive for methadone, proof that at minimum, Ms. Warren was still actively battling her heroin addiction.</p>
        <p>The city legally had the right to start proceedings to take the child, but did not. A social worker who had seen Ms. Warren's file said the city did not do it because of what it believed to be a new stability in her drug treatment and home life.</p>
        <p>That decision may well have been a mistake. On Wednesday evening, Ms. Warren was arrested on child endangerment charges after the baby girl, now 23 months old, was seen emerging from a zipped tote bag. Ms. Warren, 44, found with the baby on a subway platform in Harlem, was also charged with drug possession. The girl is in the custody of the city's child welfare agency.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Ms. Warren said that the whole affair had been blown out of proportion and that his client's behavior had partly been caused by drugs she was taking for an injury.</p>
        <p>The case, however briefly sensational, frames anew one of the more longstanding and vexing debates in child welfare. That debate, on the one hand, involves to what extent the government can deprive a mother of the right to a child, even if past performance as a parent had been deeply troubled. On the other hand, the city, trying to limit its foster care population and keep families intact, struggles to balance those concerns with fear for each child.</p>
        <p>''I understand the public outcry,'' William C. Bell, the commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services, said of the Warren case. ''Looking at it out of context, people believe the agency failed to do something. What this case demonstrates is the complexity of the judgment that has to be made.''</p>
        <p>The debate has raged since the early 1990's. That was when New York State softened regulations regarding its rights to remove newborns who test positive for drugs from their parents.</p>
        <p>Before the change, a positive test for drugs was enough for removing a child. After the regulations were changed and a lawsuit that followed was settled, a positive drug test alone was not enough to warrant taking a child from his or her parent. But a positive drug test, plus something else, like, for example, a history of abuse, could be enough to start formal removal proceedings.</p>
        <p>Still, the state left the definition of ''something else'' vague enough that social workers in the field still enjoy great latitude when deciding on removals. Ms. Warren's case clearly fell into this large gray area.</p>
        <p>To Douglas Besharov, a conservative scholar who sits on the city's child fatality review panel, when the system has wiggle room it too often errs on the side of the parent. ''The state has adopted a never-give-up attitude, and it's an endemic problem,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But to Michele Cortese, deputy director of the Center for Family Representation, who has spent 18 years representing parents as well as children in child welfare cases, keeping families together is so important to the children that the practice ''should allow for parents to make many terrible mistakes and still have the chance to get it right.''</p>
        <p>The Administration for Children's Services would not release extensive details of Ms. Warren's case. But the social worker who had seen Ms. Warren's file, and was willing to disclose limited information from it, said her case was a good illustration of why the debate continues.</p>
        <p>At the time of her daughter's birth, Ms. Warren was in a drug treatment program and had made significant strides in putting her tattered life together, according to the file. Once homeless, Ms. Warren had a place to live and had bought clothing and formula for the new baby. She had also received prenatal care and was in a program for mothers with a history of drug addiction.</p>
        <p>But the evidence that she was still a suspect parent was formidable.</p>
        <p>Over more than 10 years, Ms. Warren had her children taken away on charges that she had abused or neglected them. And her arrest record was varied and repeated -- prostitution once, robbery another time.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the city decided to take a chance. According to the social worker who had seen the file, the city tried to monitor Ms. Warren very closely for the first six months of her new daughter's life. During that period, her doctors and drug counselors reported that Ms. Warren was an attentive parent who kept all her appointments. The child welfare agency then closed Ms. Warren's file.</p>
        <p>''Once you've lost children in custody, should you have the chance to parent again?'' Mr. Bell asked. ''The law says you should be allowed the opportunity, and is anyone Solomonic enough to predict when it won't work? I don't think so.''</p>
