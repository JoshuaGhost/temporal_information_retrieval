        <p>The chief downside of the Federal Communication Commission's decency standards for the networks may be that they promote the spread of grating expressions that serve as substitutes for profanity. Obsolete or revolting epithets like ''nancy boy,'' ''wet spot'' and ''panty liner'' seriously mar the script of ''10-8'' (ABC), which has its premiere tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>The show's writers apparently believe that the story of Rico Amonte (Danny Nucci), a hood turned policeman, needs trash talk for verisimilitude, but the language here sounds forced. Because he uses it, John Henry Barnes (Ernie Hudson), Rico's training officer, comes off less as a streetwise mentor than as a simpleton pervert.</p>

        <p>The chief downside of the Federal Communication Commission's decency standards for the networks may be that they promote the spread of grating expressions that serve as substitutes for profanity. Obsolete or revolting epithets like ''nancy boy,'' ''wet spot'' and ''panty liner'' seriously mar the script of ''10-8'' (ABC), which has its premiere tomorrow night.</p>
        <p>The show's writers apparently believe that the story of Rico Amonte (Danny Nucci), a hood turned policeman, needs trash talk for verisimilitude, but the language here sounds forced. Because he uses it, John Henry Barnes (Ernie Hudson), Rico's training officer, comes off less as a streetwise mentor than as a simpleton pervert.</p>
        <p>Rico, in training at the Los Angeles sheriff's department, is a delinquent from Brooklyn whose cop brother introduced him to West Coast police work to save him from a life of crime. The action consists in his riding around and fighting bad guys with Barnes, who hazes him.</p>
        <p>The show -- its title is police code for ''on duty'' -- dilutes the premise of the mesmeric movie ''Training Day.'' The suspense of that film, in which the roguish tough-love of the training officer was incrementally exposed as sick corruption, appears nowhere in ''10-8.'' Here everyone is a touch tough, but all hearts are golden. The cliché that ''Training Day'' subverted is restored, as both cops and robbers seem mostly to be shamming their badness while waiting for a little tenderness.</p>
        <p>But even in this mundane context, Mr. Nucci, with his easy gift for alternating irony with sincerity, is irresistible. When Barnes menaces him by demanding, ''Do you pray?,'' Rico says, implacably: ''I used to. Sometimes. Christmas.'' The earnestness of the fumble wins him the exchange. Similarly, he takes Barnes's clinical and feminizing put-downs with equanimity, refusing to concede that sunny L.A. might try his soul as much as East New York.</p>
        <p>As Rico banters with fellow trainees, confides in his kindly brother and gallantly courts a stripper, he never lets you forget that prime-time L.A. police work is light stuff. Too light to sustain a drama, in fact, and that's why the show's attempts at indecency seem especially weak. Though Rico doesn't spell it out, we might even infer that elsewhere -- on HBO, say, or in Brooklyn -- thugs use real curse words.</p>
        <p>Another young man subjected to hazing, though in a much more sinister world, is Jack Turner (Rob Lowe), the hero of an excellent new show on NBC, ''The Lyon's Den,'' which also has its premiere tomorrow night. When the managing partner of an imposing Washington law firm dies mysteriously, Jack, a senator's son and morally spotless pro bono lawyer, is recruited to take his place in a move to dispel rumors that there's something rotten at the firm. Jack takes the job when a formidable partner threatens to shutter Jack's pro bono law clinic, which the firm sponsors, if he refuses.</p>
        <p>''The Lyon's Den'' is indiscriminate in tone, introducing histrionics in the form of Brit Hanley (Frances Fisher), a ludicrously scheming Lady Macbeth. But such wantonness is exciting, and it keeps the show from being too similar to legal dramas like ''Law and Order,'' whose plots derive from the evening news. Inspiration for ''The Lyon's Den'' appears more likely to have come from Scott Turow or even ''Bleak House'' rather than from Court TV.</p>
        <p>The producers of ''The Lyon's Den'' are smart to have obtained the license to do soap opera early. By setting out to create intrigue rather than would-be realism, ''The Lyon's Den'' frees itself above all to develop the compelling figure of Ariel Saxon (Elizabeth Mitchell), an alcoholic associate in the firm. Ariel is what Ally McBeal would be if she were genuinely tragic, and knew it. She's intelligent but unbalanced, and all her affiliations -- to her friends, her colleagues, the firm -- are tenuous.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Jack is overaffiliated: in addition to his suffocating colleagues, his senator father (Rip Torn) crushes him with family legacy. Young Jack can do no good without money and power, but money and power will, inevitably, sap his virtue.</p>
        <p>This is melodrama, sure, but from ''Serpico'' to ''Training Day,'' it's the great American rookie story -- and it's still a good one.</p>
