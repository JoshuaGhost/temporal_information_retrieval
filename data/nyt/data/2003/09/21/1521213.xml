        <p>Marcia Kilgore dressed for years like a classic New Yorker in all-black by Calvin Klein and Yohji Yamamoto. But when Ms. Kilgore, the owner of Bliss Spa, started living part time in London two winters ago, her style became Anglicized. ''In London, if you see people in black you think they're going to a funeral or to work as a waiter,'' Ms. Kilgore said. ''Women there wear a lot of paisleys, floral prints and sequined things. They mix cheap, kitschy items with expensive designer stuff and combine strange colors.'' She demonstrates this sensibility here with a caftan by Allegra Hicks ($150 at Scoop stores) over Long &amp; Lean jeans ($49.95 at the Gap).</p>

        <p>Next month Ms. Kilgore will open a spa at Bloomingdale's in New York, but her days of basic black may be over. ''There's a lot of quirky, individual style in London,'' she said. ''It rubs off on you.''</p>
