        <p>Honoring a Dodger</p>
        <p>Q. Exit 15, which leads to Erskine Street in Brooklyn, was recently constructed on the Belt Parkway to serve the new Gateway Mall. Was Erskine Street named for Carl Erskine, the onetime pitcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers?</p>
        <p>A. Erskine Street was indeed named for the Dodger stalwart Carl Erskine, affectionately known to Brooklynites as ''Oisk.''</p>
        <p>Andrew Ross, a spokesman for the Brooklyn borough president, said a group of engineers at Borough Hall took the opportunity to pay homage to their childhood heroes, the Dodgers, as they mapped new streets in the late 1960's and early 1970's as part of what is now the Brooklyn Developmental Center, a state facility.</p>
        <p>They named Erskine Street for the pitcher and Walker Street, two blocks away, for one of his catchers, Rube Walker. The name Erskine Street, Mr. Ross said, was officially adopted on Dec. 2, 1971.</p>
        <p>What did Erskine do to merit such adulation? Earnest Dodger fans like those engineers at Borough Hall can undoubtedly recite the numbers from memory, but to refresh everyone else's recollections, Erskine teamed with Don Newcombe to anchor the pitching rotation in the Dodgers' post-World War II glory years.</p>
        <p>Erskine spent his entire career as a Dodger from his rookie year in 1948 through his retirement at the end of the '59 season, the team's second year in Los Angeles. He logged a record of 122-78, pitched in five World Series and threw two no-hitters. And he did all that with a shoulder injury from his youth that meant he was throwing in pain throughout his career.</p>
        <p>Erskine's finest moment probably occurred in Game 3 of the 1953 Series, when he struck out 14 Yankees, a Series record that stood for 14 years. The Dodgers won the game, 3-2, but lost the Series, 4 games to 2.</p>
        <p>After he left baseball, Erskine returned to his native Indiana, where he became a successful banker.</p>
        <p>Hard to Cross</p>
        <p>Q. Is the Grand Concourse the widest residential street in New York City?</p>
        <p>A. The Grand Concourse is pretty wide. But Tom Cocola, spokesman for the Department of Transportation, says it isn't as wide as Queens Boulevard. With 12 lanes of traffic, Queens Boulevard beats out the Concourse by one full lane. The department says the Concourse is about 180 feet wide while the width of Queens Boulevard ranges from about 175 feet to 225 feet.</p>
        <p>Bronxites can take some small comfort that when properly identified as ''the Grand Boulevard and Concourse,'' it has a longer name than its Queens counterpart.</p>
        <p>Alice Under 50th St.</p>
        <p>Q. On the walls of the 50th Street subway station of the 1/9 line, are tile pictures of Alice in Wonderland. How do these pictures relate to the neighborhood?</p>
        <p>A. The mosaic art you're referring to is ''Alice: the Way Out,'' a 1994 work by Liliana Porter, an Argentine-born artist who lives and works in New York. There is no explicit connection between 50th Street and Lewis Carroll, who lived most of his life in Oxford, England. Rather, said Sandra Bloodworth, director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Arts for Transit program, there is a genial conceptual link, a playful reference to the theater district above.</p>
        <p>''Liliana is evoking the idea of the theatrical, and she's doing it with a sort of connection with the idea of being underground,'' Ms. Bloodworth said. ''You see Alice pulling the curtain back in one of the images, and you have the theaters above ground. It's her concept to connect it to the theater by way of 'Alice in Wonderland.' ''</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 5, 2003, Sunday  A report in the F.Y.I. column on Sept. 21 about a Brooklyn street named for Carl Erskine, the Dodger pitcher, referred incorrectly to a record he set by striking out 14 batters in a World Series game in 1953. It stood for 10 years, not 14. It was broken in 1963 by Sandy Koufax -- also of the Dodgers, by then in Los Angeles -- who struck out 15 New York Yankees.</p>
