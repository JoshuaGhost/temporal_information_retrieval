        <p>In response to concerns about the safety of pets traveling aboard airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration adopted a rule last month that will require airlines to submit monthly reports on the loss, injury or death of an animal during transport.</p>
        <p>The statistics will be published in the monthly Department of Transportation Air Travel Consumer Report, which includes data on flight delays, consumer complaints, overbooking and mishandled baggage.

        <p>In response to concerns about the safety of pets traveling aboard airlines, the Federal Aviation Administration adopted a rule last month that will require airlines to submit monthly reports on the loss, injury or death of an animal during transport.</p>
        <p>The statistics will be published in the monthly Department of Transportation Air Travel Consumer Report, which includes data on flight delays, consumer complaints, overbooking and mishandled baggage. Problems involving animals were previously included in the consumer complaint category, but the new rule will create a separate category for incidents reported to the airlines involving animals.</p>
        <p>According to Paul Takemoto, a spokesman for the F.A.A., carriers will be required to report the flight number, the date and time of the incident, the name, if applicable, and a description of the animal involved, as well as a description of the incident, including the suspected cause of the problem and details about any corrective action that may have been taken.</p>
        <p>The reporting requirement was mandated by Congress, and will take effect once the paperwork procedures are approved by the White House Office of Management and Budget, Mr. Takemoto said.</p>
        <p>Mimi Brody, director of federal legislation for the Humane Society of the United States in Washington, said that because there have been no statistics reported about incidents involving animals on planes, there is no way of knowing how frequently pets traveling in cargo holds suffer from problems like lack of oxygen, temperature extremes or injuries from unsecured baggage.</p>
        <p>''We hope that it will make the airlines that much more attentive, knowing that there's going to be some reporting,'' Ms. Brody said.</p>
        <p>But for now, the Humane Society of the United States recommends that people not transport their pets in airline cargo holds unless absolutely necessary. ''We think they're better off not flying with their animals if they can help it.''</p>
