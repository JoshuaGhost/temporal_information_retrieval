        <p>If the plays of Arthur Schnitzler accurately reflect the mores of early-20th-century Vienna, it is easy to understand how his friend Sigmund Freud developed theories that sex is the main driving force in the human psyche. In ''Das Weite Land,'' a 1911 play that is being offered for the second time this year by the Mint Theater Company, Schnitzler examines the subject of marital fidelity and its accompanying baggage of seduction, deceit and jealousy.</p>

        <p>'Far and Wide'  Mint Theater Company</p>
        <p>If the plays of Arthur Schnitzler accurately reflect the mores of early-20th-century Vienna, it is easy to understand how his friend Sigmund Freud developed theories that sex is the main driving force in the human psyche. In ''Das Weite Land,'' a 1911 play that is being offered for the second time this year by the Mint Theater Company, Schnitzler examines the subject of marital fidelity and its accompanying baggage of seduction, deceit and jealousy.</p>
        <p>In an adaptation he has titled ''Far and Wide,'' the Mint's artistic director, Jonathan Banks, has mounted a commendable staging of Schnitzler's melodrama that was first presented in February and now returns with a couple of new cast members and a slightly more urbane reading that gives added attention to the moral arguments Schnitzler sought to address.</p>
        <p>The story centers on Genia and Friedrich Hofreiter, and it begins and ends with violent deaths: the suicide of a young pianist who may or may not have killed himself over unrequited love for Genia, and a fatal duel instigated by Friedrich out of jealousy. There are several subplots swirling around, but they are variations on the theme of sex and the married couple in the last days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Mr. Banks has pared the original cast of some 30 characters to one half that size.</p>
        <p>The roles of Genia, who wears her virtue as a badge of honor until she is tempted by the son of a neighbor, and Friedrich, a sort of Hapsburg version of Don Juan for whom sexual conquest is a lifelong hobby, are reprised by Lisa Bostnar and Hans Tester. Ms. Bostnar is again excellent as Genia, wearing a fixed smile to hide her anguish yet keeping her arms crossed over her chest to ward off intimacy. Mr. Tester is credible as her profligate husband, but his animated performance, punctuated by expansive gestures and nervous laughter, occasionally seems exaggerated for an Austrian industrialist.</p>
        <p>Among the replacement roles Kate Arrington is more icily calculating than coquettishly alluring as Erna, the young daughter of a family friend who is willingly seduced by Friedrich. Ms. Arrington also has a tendency to stare blankly ahead of her when she is not directly involved in a scene. Joshua Decker is earnest as Otto, the young man who woos Genia.</p>
        <p>The physical production is mostly unchanged from the original. Theresa Squire's pre-World War I costumes are lovely, but Vicki R. Davis's set, dominated by a chain-link fence that looks as if it belongs around an urban playground rather than a tennis court at a Baden villa, is a distraction.</p>
