        <p>On a trip to his native Chile several months ago, Alfonso Escobar, above, an optician who has owned Page &amp; Smith, 42 East 59th Street, with his brother, James, for the past 10 years, tasted some chocolates made by Félix Brunatto. The Escobars now import the treats from Mr. Brunatto's shop, L'Atelier del Cioccolato, and sell them along with their designer spectacles.</p>
        <p>The bittersweet chocolates have surprising fillings seasoned with mustard, curry, pepper, oregano, Italian wild strawberry and rosemary. The spices offer subtly intriguing touches, not blasts of weird flavor, and marry well with the intensity of the chocolate. The Escobars recommend nibbling them with wine. Perishable cheese fillings like Camembert and such are available on special order. The chocolates are $32 a box, holding nearly a pound.</p>

        <p>Selling eyewear and sweets isn't new: the Lunettes et Chocolat shop in SoHo has done it for a few years. It's just a new spin on the term ''eye candy.''</p>
