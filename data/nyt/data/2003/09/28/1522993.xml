        <p>BEFORE ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy'' put fresh helium in that sagging balloon of yesteryear -- the epigrammatically gifted, swish and style-savvy homosexual -- the bon mot belonged unequivocally to Jeffrey Bilhuber, the Manhattan decorator who has done apartments for both Anna Wintour of Vogue and Patrick McCarthy of W. While his former associate, Thom Filicia, is one of the ''Queer Eye'' stars, Mr. Bilhuber himself is not a fan of reality shows.</p>
        <p>''I don't like reality,'' he said last week. ''That's why I'm a decorator.''</p>
        <p>From the Paul Lynde-like way he can fling a quip, you might theorize a penchant for candy-bright colors and dramatic -- make that melodramatic -- design statements. But no. A frank devotee of beige and its kin, Mr. Bilhuber has a sober, if stylish, bent in his work. The most outr√© thing in his Upper East Side apartment is a fur throw at the foot of his bed.</p>
        <p>And his most prized belonging is not a fantastic objet he picked up at the Paris flea market, but something far more sentimental: his silver baby cup. Ever since his mother sent him the cup eight or so years ago, he has kept it gleaming and polished on the rim of the bathroom sink. He even travels with it.</p>
        <p>''I love maintaining it,'' he said. ''I use it to rinse after I brush my teeth -- it has to be clean.''</p>
        <p>The burnishing is not just a sanitary fetish, though. The cup has to shine in figurative ways as well. ''It's a moment I have where everything is good and sweet and innocent,'' he said, ''before all hell breaks loose.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bilhuber has assembled his thoughts on design in a book, ''Jeffrey Bilhuber's Design Basics,'' out next month from Rizzoli, and readers may be surprised that it contains more practical advice than clever catticisms. And the baby cup, a gift from his paternal grandmother, Elsa, hints at the sincerity he brings to his job.</p>
        <p>''Objects come and go in my life,'' he said. And while the cup is, he maintained, ''inherently worthless,'' it lends a sense of history and continuity that might otherwise seem lacking in the persona he has made up out of whole cloth.</p>
        <p>The cup's only drawback, he noted, is that it bears his birth date, 12-26-56, all too clearly, though that doesn't keep him from showing it off, even if the audience is unreceptive. ''Sometimes when I show it to people, they just go blank,'' he said, appalled.</p>
        <p>The cup was made by Lunt Silversmiths of Greenfield, Mass., which has made them since its founding in 1902. At that time, sterling baby cups had already been a customary gift for decades, conferring a blessing for a genteel future. Today, Lunt is one of the few remaining family-owned silver companies in the country, and baby cups, which run about $100, are one of the few growth markets in sterling. Most once-silver wares are now made of stainless steel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bilhuber can relate. He said that lately he has been contacted, like many prominent designers, by reality-television producers eager to muscle into the makeover-crazed market that made ''Queer Eye'' a hit. But he is sticking with his independently owned, silver-lined cloud. ''I'm not the sort of person to sit patiently by waiting for a sound check,'' he said. ''I'd burn the set to the ground.''</p>
        <p>If only we were all so in touch with our inner infant.</p>
