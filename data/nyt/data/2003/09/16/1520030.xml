        <p>The Lockheed Martin Corporation said last night that it would buy the Titan Corporation for $1.8 billion in cash and stock to handle more of the government's communications systems and information networks.</p>
        <p>''We are expanding our footprint in our traditional market, with the Department of Defense and federal civil agencies,'' said Jeffrey MacLauchlan, a Lockheed vice president for financial strategies and the head of its mergers and acquisitions unit.</p>
        <p>Under the agreement, Titan's stockholders can choose to receive about $22 a share, a 30 percent premium over yesterday's closing price of $16.96. Titan shareholders may also opt for an equivalent amount of Lockheed Martin common stock or a combination of cash and stock. The transaction would include $580 million of Titan's debt.</p>
        <p>The boards of both companies have approved the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter of 2004. It is contingent on approval from Titan shareholders, the Justice Department and the Pentagon.</p>
        <p>If approved, the acquisition would be Lockheed Martin's latest in a string of deals intended to increase its share of the government's business. Last month, Lockheed said it would acquire the federal information technology unit of Affiliated Computer Services.</p>
        <p>''The other acquisitions were similar in that they were government-focused and they were information-technology focused,'' Mr. MacLauchlan said.</p>
        <p>Titan, based in San Diego, does nearly all its business with the government, providing communications systems and products to gather intelligence.</p>
        <p>Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., said it had no plans to move Titan or to close any of its operations.</p>
