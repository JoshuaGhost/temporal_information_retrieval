        <p>Gen. Wesley K. Clark has gathered $750,000 in unsolicited contributions since Thursday, when he announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign aides said today.</p>
        <p>General Clark is in a race against the clock: the other nine candidates, who have been collecting money for a year, will file their third-quarter reports on Sept. 30.

        <p>Gen. Wesley K. Clark has gathered $750,000 in unsolicited contributions since Thursday, when he announced his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign aides said today.</p>
        <p>General Clark is in a race against the clock: the other nine candidates, who have been collecting money for a year, will file their third-quarter reports on Sept. 30. Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts had led the fund-raising as of the last filing, on June 30, with $16 million, but Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, is expected to have surged ahead, having raised $10 million so far in this quarter alone.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Dr. Dean has set a new goal of collecting $5 million in the next 10 days.</p>
        <p>For General Clark, the ability to collect substantial money quickly will be an important marker for his incipient candidacy. Aides said they had sent e-mail messages to people who had pledged a total of $1.9 million through Draft Clark Web sites.</p>
        <p>General Clark, who retired from the military in 2000, has also scheduled three fund-raising events in New York for Monday night. He plans to spend most of the week studying campaign issues and preparing for his first debate, scheduled for Thursday afternoon in New York City.</p>
        <p>A Newsweek poll released today showed General Clark leading the Democratic field, with 14 percent of registered Democrats supporting him. That put him slightly ahead of Dr. Dean and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, each of whom had 12 percent. Senator Kerry came in at 10 percent, and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri had 8 percent.</p>
        <p>The Newsweek poll also forecast that no Democrat at this point would beat President Bush in a head-to-head matchup. But General Clark did better than the others, with 43 percent to the president's 47 percent.</p>
