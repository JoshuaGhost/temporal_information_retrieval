        <p>A year ago, the Giants' defense presented a tantalizing opportunity for St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner: a mostly man-to-man scheme featuring two second-year cornerbacks. All Warner had to do was get the ball deep and watch his fleet receivers turn the game into a yardage bonanza.</p>
        <p>Warner, however, could not get the ball deep, not regularly. Separating him from that tempting man-to-man coverage was a Giants pass rush that turned his bonanza into a scramble-for-your-life nightmare -- one sack, one fumble, the star running back Marshall Faulk harassed into a fumble on a fourth-and-1, five solo tackles by defensive end Michael Strahan, countless plays turned into chaos while the Giants' defensive linemen spent nearly as much time in the Rams' backfield as Warner did.</p>

        <p>A year ago, the Giants' defense presented a tantalizing opportunity for St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner: a mostly man-to-man scheme featuring two second-year cornerbacks. All Warner had to do was get the ball deep and watch his fleet receivers turn the game into a yardage bonanza.</p>
        <p>Warner, however, could not get the ball deep, not regularly. Separating him from that tempting man-to-man coverage was a Giants pass rush that turned his bonanza into a scramble-for-your-life nightmare -- one sack, one fumble, the star running back Marshall Faulk harassed into a fumble on a fourth-and-1, five solo tackles by defensive end Michael Strahan, countless plays turned into chaos while the Giants' defensive linemen spent nearly as much time in the Rams' backfield as Warner did.</p>
        <p>It is easy to push the Giants' 26-21 victory into the same pile as the Rams' other eight losses in a largely disastrous season for St. Louis, but Warner was still healthy for that game, and so was Faulk. And there are elements of the Giants' defense that will stack up well against the Rams, their health notwithstanding, in Sunday's season opener at Giants Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Obviously their pass rushing has always been great,'' Warner said. ''You always have to take care of Strahan, but they have four guys up front that can push the pile. That is obviously a huge key. One of the things that we've struggled with is pressure up front.''</p>
        <p>Strahan is back, of course, though a broken toe in the preseason has made it a question of how quickly he will reach his usual level of play. The Giants also spent a great deal of their off-season making moves to shore up the players around him, drafting William Joseph and Osi Umenyiora and signing the free agent Keith Washington. Along with the veterans Kenny Holmes and Keith Hamilton, the Giants suddenly have depth in one of their most dangerous units.</p>
        <p>That depth will come in handy when one of the main objectives will be to chase Warner.</p>
        <p>''He's one of those quarterbacks, if you let him get in a rhythm, get some people open, he can scorch you,'' Giants Coach Jim Fassel said. ''I think it's important that we try to break his rhythm, disrupt his timing.''</p>
        <p>The Rams have tried to upgrade their offensive line, trading for tackle Kyle Turley and signing the free-agent center Dave Wohlabaugh. That unit got its biggest lift when the star tackle Orlando Pace ended his holdout, which lasted much of the preseason.</p>
        <p>But even if the Rams hold off the Giants' pass rush, they will see a more mature Giants defense behind it.</p>
        <p>Will Allen and Will Peterson, the corners, are another year older, both heading into their third season. They held up well in the man-to-man scheme last season, and the coordinator Johnnie Lynn has been adding more variety to the defense this season.</p>
        <p>''I definitely feel we're a better defense,'' Allen said. ''We have to go out there and prove it.''</p>
        <p>Warner said he thought the Giants' corners were formidable, and getting better with experience.</p>
        <p>''I think they're very confident with their man-to-man, the way it is now,'' Warner said. ''I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of that. But they will try and keep us off-balance and try to get pressure with the front guys and take pressure off the back end guys. I think that is how they are going to attack us.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the corners got an immeasurable boost facing down an offense with Warner throwing to receivers Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce. They combined for 14 catches but made a lot of them coming back to the ball to bail out a scrambling Warner. That helped hold them to 167 yards combined, which is modest by Rams standards.</p>
        <p>''If you want to see how you stack up, how your secondary is, how your pass defense is, you want to play the Rams,'' safety Shaun Williams said. ''Not only are they one of the best offenses in the league today but of all time.''</p>
        <p>The Giants will be looking to pass that test for the second year in a row.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>Tight end JEREMY SHOCKEY's first scheduled appearance of the season with the news media lasted 25 seconds on Wednesday. He said that he was working on getting healthy, that he did not have anything to say about the Rams and that he had to rush off to a meeting, although Coach JIM FASSEL had already said that Shockey had been given permission to miss the beginning of that meeting. Turnovers have been a point of emphasis for the Giants, although it only began to show on the field in the final preseason game -- and most of those came on special teams. The Giants got four turnovers against the Rams last season, and only 21 more in their other 15 regular-season games. ''Turnovers go hand in hand with great defenses,'' safety SHAUN WILLIAMS said. ''If we want to be considered in the same sentence as the top defenses in the league, the Tampa Bays, the Philadelphias, those teams get turnovers.''</p>
