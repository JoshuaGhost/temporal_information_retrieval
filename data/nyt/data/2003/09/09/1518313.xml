        <p>In ''Suddenly, Mars Was Close Enough to Ignite the Imagination'' (Sept. 2), Percival Lowell's theories about Martian canals were presented, but the earlier observations of them, by Giovanni Schiaparelli in 1877, were not mentioned. Mr. Schiaparelli called them ''canali,'' which can as easily be translated to mean ''channels'' as ''canals.''</p>

        <p>It was Mr. Lowell who fired the public imagination by suggesting in 1895 that they were indeed artificial constructions by Martians, possibly the result of his own mistranslation of the Italian and the enthusiasms of the post-Jules Verne age.</p>
