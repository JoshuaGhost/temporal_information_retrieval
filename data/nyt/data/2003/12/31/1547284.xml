        <p>Marta Sofer sat in her mother's apartment in Brooklyn, spinning stories of her childhood, and of her mother, Rozsi Weisz.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weisz was being interviewed about her recent stroke, but she had her mind on something else entirely. It was her brawny physical therapist, Silva.</p>
        <p>''She waits for him every week like the Messiah,'' Mrs. Sofer, 48, said of the therapist. ''He dares to teach her to walk with a cane.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weisz stared at Mrs. Sofer from her chair, a smile playing at the fine lines around her mouth. Leaning in, she said something in Hungarian, her only language. Mrs. Sofer blushed, reluctant to translate.</p>
        <p>''She says all she wants to do for New Year's is dance with him,'' Mrs. Sofer said, and Mrs. Weisz muttered elaborations about how ''strong'' Silva was, and what a good-looking man he is.</p>
        <p>Then she added something else, again translated by her daughter: ''She says she doesn't care if it is next year already because she hopes it will be better than this year was for her.''</p>
        <p>It was just about a year ago when Mrs. Weisz, 80, suffered a stroke, one that left an often busy, always social woman incapacitated and reliant on a wheelchair. Though the worst parts of the ordeal -- operations, doctors, two months in a hospital, the loss of her ability to walk -- have passed, she still has bouts of depression and panic attacks about being left in a room by herself.</p>
        <p>But the most difficult problems now, a full year later, have been the practical ones. Problems like how to prepare food. How to take a shower. And yes, how she will ever be able to dance with Silva.</p>
        <p>The recent stroke was Mrs. Weisz's second, but the earlier one had only minimal effects. She went right back home to her apartment in a senior citizens' complex, and needed only part-time assistance from a home care aide. It was the only apartment she had lived in since Mrs. Sofer brought her from Hungary in 1989.</p>
        <p>In Hungary, Mrs. Weisz, the widow of a rabbi, had spent long nights alone in an empty synagogue. Her daughter felt she needed to be with family. But Mrs. Weisz's son, Israel Weisz, was in Israel, and other relatives had died in the Holocaust.</p>
        <p>In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Mrs. Weisz lives blocks from her daughter, who comes over for lunch every day. The two used to chat only occasionally by phone, but since the recent stroke, Mrs. Sofer comes by to relieve the home care aide at lunchtime. The aide lives with Mrs. Weisz.</p>
        <p>The stroke happened as Mrs. Weisz was untying her shoes and getting ready for bed: she slumped over and fell to the floor.</p>
        <p>''She likes to do things herself,'' her daughter said. At the hospital, doctors found that a blood clot had entered Mrs. Weisz's brain. The left side of her body became paralyzed, and she needed three people at the hospital to move her.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sofer spent all night and day with her mother, leaving her five children and husband at home.</p>
        <p>A new side of a strong, sociable mother began to emerge. Mrs. Weisz cried whenever she was left alone, and trembled uncontrollably. Doctors at the Rusk Institute, where she underwent rehabilitation, said the only option was a long-term care facility.</p>
        <p>''That's what they always called it,'' Mrs. Sofer said. ''But I knew they meant a nursing home.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sofer said that when the implications of that choice sank in, she cried nonstop. A week later, she decided on an option of her own making: she took her mother back to Brooklyn instead.</p>
        <p>''As soon as I decided that, I felt better,'' she said. ''I stopped crying.''</p>
        <p>But taking Mrs. Weisz back to her old apartment would require more than a van and a wheelchair. Aside from the increased costs of a full-time home care aide, Mrs. Weisz had difficulty getting around the small apartment in her wheelchair.</p>
        <p>It was also clear that she could no longer get into her shower; the tub was too high. One of the older men who was a regular visitor of Mrs. Weisz's (''This door is always open,'' Mrs. Sofer said) was in a wheelchair, and had one of the rare handicapped-accessible apartments in the building. Twice a week Mrs. Sofer helped the home aide move Mrs. Weisz to his apartment for a shower.</p>
        <p>''He was a nice man, and it was clean,'' Mrs. Sofer said. But going up in the elevator and coming down dripping wet was no permanent solution.</p>
        <p>So Mrs. Sofer, who had used her mother's Medicaid allotment on hospital bills and physical therapy, turned to the United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburg for help. It, in turn, took the case to the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, a coordinating group for UJO and 24 other Jewish Community Councils across the city, requesting $5,800 in emergency assistance funds.</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Council is itself an affiliate of UJA-Federation of New York, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.</p>
        <p>To pay for a new, accessible shower for Mrs. Weisz, UJO provided $2,500 through a Holocaust survivors' fund. The Metropolitan Council provided the remaining $3,300, of which $1,800 came from the Neediest Cases.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Weisz has other financial needs. But with her new shower, and some help from the physical therapist, her outlook is brighter.</p>
        <p>Silva, Mrs. Sofer explained, ''built her up.''</p>
        <p>''It took a while, and the lady's happy,'' she added. ''And I don't have to come running to bathe her every time.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Sofer smiled. ''It's much easier for her now physically,'' she said. ''And emotionally, too.''</p>
