        <p>Israel developed a risky plan in 1992 to assassinate Saddam Hussein at a funeral but dropped it after five Israeli soldiers were killed while training for the mission, according to Israeli news reports on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel during the Persian Gulf war of 1991, but Israel, under strong pressure from the United States, refrained from striking back.</p>
        <p>After the war, however, Israel began investigating the possibility of killing Mr. Hussein, and the Israeli prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, approved a detailed study in 1992, according to reports in the nation's leading newspapers, including Maariv and Yediot Ahronot.</p>
        <p>Also in 1992, one of Mr. Hussein's closest relatives, his uncle -- and father-in-law -- Khairallah Tilfah, became terminally ill. Mr. Tilfah had raised Mr. Hussein, whose father died before Mr. Hussein was born. Mr. Hussein also married Mr. Tilfah's daughter Sajida.</p>
        <p>The Israeli newspapers reported that the Israeli military believed Mr. Hussein could be killed at Mr. Tilfah's funeral because he would probably not send one of his doubles to such an important personal event.</p>
        <p>The plan, named Operation Bramble Bush, called for helicopters to drop members of an elite military unit, Sayeret Matkal, outside Mr. Hussein's hometown of Tikrit, where the funeral was most likely to take place. They were to dig in and camouflage themselves a few hundred yards from a spot where Mr. Hussein was considered likely to travel.</p>
        <p>At a meeting about the plan held on Oct. 2, 1992, Mr. Rabin ''went into the tiniest details,'' Nadav Zeevi, a major in the Israeli reserves, was quoted as saying by Yediot Ahronot.</p>
        <p>''He checked and questioned and investigated and was very interested,'' the newspaper reported Major Zeevi as saying. ''At the end of the meeting, he demanded certainty of at least 98 percent before he would approve the operation.''</p>
        <p>The Israelis staged a simulation in the southern desert on Nov. 5, 1992, but the unit that was to carry out the attack mistakenly fired a real missile at Israeli soldiers serving as stand-ins for Mr. Hussein and his bodyguards, the reports said. The plan was dropped without ever being presented to the government for approval, the reports added.</p>
        <p>The deaths of the five soldiers were reported at the time as a training accident. The Israeli military censor did not lift a ban on publication of the full account until after Mr. Hussein's capture by American soldiers on Saturday.</p>
