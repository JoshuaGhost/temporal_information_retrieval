        <p>What follows may be a suggestion for a donation to a cause supported by the person who died: a college scholarship fund, a soup kitchen, a symphony orchestra, a shelter for abandoned pets.

        <p>''IN lieu of flowers,'' many obituary notices say, ''the family requests...''</p>
        <p>What follows may be a suggestion for a donation to a cause supported by the person who died: a college scholarship fund, a soup kitchen, a symphony orchestra, a shelter for abandoned pets. Or perhaps the family wants to direct contributions to an organization seeking a cure for a disease. Then again, the money could go toward a more tangible monument: the planting of trees, land preserved for a park, a stained-glass window in a house of worship.</p>
        <p>In every case, the impulse is the same: to remember a life and remind those who survive why that life mattered.</p>
        <p>Much the same impulse governs this annual collection of articles summing up the lives of notable Long Island residents -- some already well known, all worth knowing. Marcelle S. Fischler researched and wrote the 17 selected profiles of Long Islanders who died in 2003.</p>
        <p>Article, Pages 8 and 9.</p>
