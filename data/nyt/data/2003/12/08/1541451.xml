        <p>If every underdog has his day, this was Bill White's as he savored a decisive victory on Saturday in the runoff for mayor of Houston.</p>
        <p>Mr. White, 49, a businessman, former chairman of the Texas Democratic Party and deputy energy secretary in the Clinton administration, began far behind two opponents early this year. But he easily beat Orlando Sanchez, 46, a Republican and former city councilman, 62 percent to 38 percent, in the costliest mayor's race in city history.</p>
        <p>''I'm Bill White and I'm ready to serve as Houston's next mayor,'' Mr. White told cheering supporters on Saturday night in his victory speech, which began while Mr. Sanchez was still delivering his concession speech in another hotel.</p>
        <p>Mr. White, who ran a cerebral race that commanded the advertising airwaves, vowed to turn his campaign into a ''civic movement'' to tackle the traffic, budget, flooding and police woes in Houston, the fourth most populous city in the nation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanchez, who was hoping to become the city's first Hispanic mayor, lost a close race to the incumbent, Mayor Lee P. Brown, two years ago. Mr. Brown, a former police commissioner of New York City, was barred by term limits from running for a fourth two-year term, but sagging approval ratings would have made for a difficult re-election campaign, political experts said.</p>
        <p>Another contender, Sylvester Turner of the state House of Representatives, was making his second bid for mayor after a narrow loss in 1991 but was eliminated in the election on Nov. 4.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Sanchez, Mr. Turner, who is African-American, and Mr. White, who is white, the mayoral race mirrored the ethnic and racial makeup of Houston, a city where no group holds a majority and where voting blocs are a staple of elections.</p>
        <p>But Mr. White built his victory on a technocrat's managerial platform that drew wide support and cut across traditional lines. He was endorsed by Mayor Brown and four other former mayors.</p>
        <p>Mr. White is chairman of an investment consortium, the Wedge Group, which he will leave when he takes office on Jan. 2. He put $2.3 million of his own money into his campaign and raised $6 million more from contributors. Mr. Sanchez spent $3.3 million in direct contributions and Mr. Turner about $1 million, for a total of more than $12 million.</p>
        <p>The mayor of Houston, who earns $165,817 a year, enjoys one of the nation's strongest city pulpits. The mayor has appointive powers beyond those of many of his big-city colleagues, operates as his own city manager and sits on the City Council.</p>
        <p>And the eyes of the nation will be on Houston on Feb. 1 when it plays host to the Super Bowl and showcases a new light-rail system for the occasion.</p>
        <p>Houston elections are nonpartisan. But Mr. White was long identified as a Democrat and Mr. Sanchez a Republican. Although Mr. Sanchez attracted some support from the national party, Mr. White maintained good relations with the Bush administration and was spared sharp partisan attack. His victory makes him one of the few successful Democrats in a state dominated by Republicans.</p>
        <p>The hard-fought campaign flirted with farce several months ago when a scheme emerged to slip another candidate named Bill White onto the ballot, evidently to siphon votes from Mr. White the businessman. A woman said she had been paid by the Turner camp to arrange the ploy; Mr. Turner denied it. But then the real Mr. White drew fire by giving her $5,000 to cover her expenses and drop the effort. No charges were filed against anyone.</p>
        <p>Mr. White said he would focus his efforts on guiding Houston's explosive growth.</p>
        <p>''Houston is like my 12-year-old son who outgrew his pants three times last year, which is good,'' he said an interview in his campaign office as the race wound down a few days ago. ''But traditionally Houston waits to buy its pants until they're outgrown.''</p>
