        <p>A New York season was once a must for dance companies. But in recent years some major troupes have bypassed the city, among them the Royal Danish Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet of Chicago. One reason is familiar in crowded New York: a lack of space.</p>
        <p>Of course City Center, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center are familiar, well used (and expensive) major dance stages. And the city is dotted with small dance sites. But to many in the dance world, these two extremes -- large halls and cozy downtown dance houses -- are far from enough.</p>
        <p>Enter the Joyce Theater and its director, Linda Shelton, who has been a persistent player in discussions about an arts complex at the World Trade Center site. The Joyce seeks to place dance at the front and center of the debate over how to redevelop Lower Manhattan, and central issue is space; that New York's dance card is full this year only underscores the demand for it.</p>
        <p>What is needed, Ms. Shelton and other dance producers and company directors say, is a midsize-to-large dance theater (1,000 to 2,200 seats) with stages big enough to accommodate large companies with productions -- classics like ''Swan Lake,'' for example -- that require more scenery than a backdrop and a few props.</p>
        <p>City Center, a 2,750-seat theater with a rich dance history, is no longer affordable for many companies, though there are troupes that do well or well enough at its box office every year. Even if one or more sections of the center were closed to create a smaller house with a more realistic number of seats, the entire theater would still have to be rented and a full staff and services paid for.</p>
        <p>Availability is also a problem with the city's other large theaters -- the Metropolitan Opera House (3,718 seats) and the New York State Theater (2,737 seats) -- which are home to resident opera and ballet companies and tend to have little bookable time.</p>
        <p>The 472-seat Joyce, which rose from the shell of a grimy Chelsea movie theater in 1982, is one of the most widely recognized dance sites in the city. It is the theater that dancers graduate to after performing in the small downtown dance houses where reputations are made. Midsize companies from around the world perform there. But after the Joyce, there is nowhere to go for established troupes like the Merce Cunningham Dance Company and the Miami City Ballet.</p>
        <p>''There are so many companies that require more wing or fly space and have audiences that cannot be accommodated in a 472-seat theater,'' Ms. Shelton said. ''There is certainly enough product, enough companies, to go from the Joyce to a larger theater.''</p>
        <p>About a decade ago, Ms. Shelton began searching for an affordable site or building that would be smaller than City Center but bigger than the Joyce. She looked throughout the city, including the western perimeters of Chelsea before its real estate boom. For a time it looked as if there might be room for the theater in a proposed arts complex on West 52nd Street.</p>
        <p>But a groundswell began much earlier, in the 1960's, when Charles L. Reinhart, now the director of the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., began lobbying for a home for dance in New York. Several plans to make City Center, in Midtown, such a theater had been floated unsuccessfully, including a proposal by Howard M. Squadron, the center's chairman, in the 1970's. In 1995 Mr. Reinhart convened a meeting, attended by dance producers and representatives of most of the established troupes, to discuss the creation of a New York center for modern dance.</p>
        <p>Nothing came of the meeting. But Mr. Reinhart has continued to promote the idea of a dance theater that would seat 2,200, like the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, where he is artistic director of dance. That theater, which is large but intimate enough for good dance viewing, ''is pretty close to ideal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a 1999 report commissioned by the New York State Council on the Arts, Robert Yesselman, a dance administrator, wrote: ''The need for an affordable, midsize theater designed as a New York center for contemporary dance is a real one. The absence of such a center is a severely limiting factor on dance's ability to build audiences, to foster the financial stability of New York City-based dance companies, to serve as a focus for fund-raising and marketing and to acknowledge contemporary dance's ongoing contributions to national and world culture.''</p>
        <p>Arlene Shuler, president and chief executive of City Center, agrees. ''There needs to be a variety of venues for the wide variety of companies that perform in New York,'' she said in an recent interview. ''We are one piece of that spectrum.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Shelton has met with Daniel Libeskind, the lead architect of the plan for the World Trade Center site, and with members of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, which is overseeing the work. Even before Sept. 11, she had talked with the corporation about a possible large theater downtown.</p>
        <p>''Our study suggests that 900 to 1,000 seats would be the ideal size,'' she said. ''But we are re-evaluating the number of seats, which could go a bit higher.''</p>
        <p>The corporation's chairman, John C. Whitehead, said that he was ''delighted that the Joyce is interested in becoming one of the key elements of our revitalization program'' but that no final plans had been made.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shelton's proposal includes a stage that is 150 feet wide and 50 feet deep, with wings and space to hang scenery. Requiring an estimated 115,000 total square feet, the building would include offices and glass-fronted street-level studios, where passersby could watch dancers taking classes and rehearsing.</p>
        <p>''A lot of choreographers keep their creative process private,'' Ms. Shelton said. ''I think that unfortunately makes dance more mysterious and keeps the public away.'' Lunchtime talks for downtown workers and residents would be another way to explore and demystify the art.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shelton's model theater would be devoted to dance most of the time and would be available several weeks a year to nondance events like the Tribeca Film Festival.</p>
        <p>''Dance has to be part of the theater's name,'' she said, offering International Dance Theater as an example. ''This can't be a shared venue. If it is, none of the parties will be satisfied. It has to be a dance destination. It's dance's turn for its own major center in New York.''</p>
