        <p>For 10 months, an image of the future World Trade Center site by Studio Daniel Libeskind has circulated widely. Its architectural signature was a building -- Gov. George E.

        <p>The 1,776-foot-tall Freedom Tower, part of the master plan for ground zero, may end up looking a lot like a design idea that was floated in the first days after the attack.</p>

        <p>THERE is, as the public will learn next week, a difference between a plan and a design, a design and a design concept. All the difference in the world.</p>
        <p>For 10 months, an image of the future World Trade Center site by Studio Daniel Libeskind has circulated widely. Its architectural signature was a building -- Gov. George E. Pataki called it the Freedom Tower -- twice as tall as any other on the site. This was a silvery, complex crystalline form with an angular spire that rose along its western edge and then soared even farther skyward to a needle tip 1,776 feet high.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said this design ''promises to add an element of modern vision and magnificence to the already striking New York City skyline'' when it was chosen in February as the ''design concept'' for the trade center site by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Seven months later, during which time the notion of a ''design concept'' had morphed in official parlance into the ''master plan,'' Mr. Libeskind reported, ''After much study and evaluation, the plan's essential elements remain clearly intact.''</p>
        <p>At the same time Mr. Libeskind was shoring up the overall plan, he was losing control of the design of Freedom Tower.</p>
        <p>That design is now a torqued and tapering shaft culminating in an open framework of cables, trusses and windmills reaching the height of 1,776 feet, with an antenna scraping the sky at 2,000 feet. The architect is David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, working for the developer Larry A. Silverstein, along with the engineer Guy Nordenson.</p>
        <p>In the middle of what state officials are always proud to describe as a transparent planning process, a private developer has been pursuing his own vision for the site.</p>
        <p>This may put both Mr. Pataki and Mr. Libeskind in an awkward spot next week, when the governor is supposed to receive the final design and then, presumably, present it to the public. Artful language may be needed to reconcile Mr. Childs's design with Mr. Libeskind's plan, if the goal, indeed, is to paint this as a seamless and inevitable transition.</p>
        <p>As the official ''master plan architect for the World Trade Center site,'' Mr. Libeskind may face the choice of endorsing someone else's design as a reflection of his own intent (unless some architectural feature is added that permits him more of a claim of authorship) or certifying at least that the Skidmore design is consonant with his overall plan.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Libeskind nor Mr. Childs is discussing the matter publicly.</p>
        <p>The idea of a torqued tower at the trade center site can be traced to the days immediately after the attack. On Sept. 17, 2001, the architect Richard Dattner sketched a linked pair of twisted towers, not quite as high as the originals. He refined the design and sent out about 50 booklets describing the proposal. One went to Mr. Silverstein, the commercial leaseholder at the site, and was forwarded to Mr. Childs, who was already working for Silverstein Properties.</p>
        <p>''Larry was most intrigued by them (as was I),'' Mr. Childs wrote to Mr. Dattner on Oct. 12, 2001, ''and he thought that all of us advising him should be aware of this.''</p>
        <p>A year later -- and careful not to claim sole authorship -- Mr. Nordenson presented a torqued tower concept in The New York Times Magazine. There were, he noted, many precedents in the work of Isamu Noguchi, Frank Gehry and Mr. Dattner, among others.</p>
        <p>Until the final design is unveiled next week, it would be premature to guess how successfully the latest version of Freedom Tower will fit into Mr. Libeskind's plan. But the fact that its origins predate the plan by many months suggests something of the challenge.</p>
        <p>Studio Daniel Libeskind lost its urban planning consultant yesterday when Gary A. Hack resigned from the position, citing the ''immense embarrassment'' caused by two articles this week in The New York Post that described a lecture he delivered in October at the State University of New York in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>The Post quoted Mr. Hack as describing the contest to plan the rebuilding of the trade center as the ''architectural equivalent of nuclear war.'' The other finalist was a collective known as Think, which proposed two open latticework towers. ''We began to refer to the other scheme, and got others to refer to it, as 'the skeleton,' '' Mr. Hack was quoted as saying.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued by his office at the University of Pennsylvania, Mr. Hack apologized for ''overemphasizing the public perception of the project'' and said he was not speaking for Studio Daniel Libeskind.</p>
        <p>But he also said, ''The published comments were lifted out of context to serve the journalist's longstanding agenda of subverting the plan.''</p>
        <p>William Neuman, who wrote the Post articles after spending two months trying to obtain a tape of the lecture, said, ''It appears Gary Hack has been stung by the truth.''</p>
