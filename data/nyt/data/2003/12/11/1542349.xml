        <p>SIMON--Paul. The Institute of International Education Board of Trustees and staff deeply mourn the death of our distinguished Trustee, Senator Paul Simon, who was known for the great depth of his honor and integrity throughout his 40 year career in public service and his leadership in public policy. We are grateful to have been touched by his extraordinary vision and commitment. We were honored by his service on our board, and privileged to have been working with him on his most recent initiative, the proposed Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program. We hope to see this program realized, and to see his legacy include the far reaching benefits that it offers our country and the world. We express our deepest sympathy to the Simon family. Allan Goodman, President Thomas S. Johnson, Chairman</p>
        <p>SIMON--Paul. The Board of Directors, members and staff of Research!America honor the memory of an outstanding public servant who brought a refreshing combination of common sense and decency to our nation's capitol. He continued to serve our nation after his terms in office, encouraging his former colleagues in congress to support medical and health research. We extend our condolences to his family and salute his memory. Hon. Paul G. Rogers, Chair Mary Woolley, President</p>
