        <p>''Los Angeles by Kayak: Vistas of Concrete Banks'' (Los Angeles Journal, front page, Dec. 8) brought up memories of growing up in North Long Beach during and after World War II.</p>
        <p>We lived on a street blunted at the end by the ''river bank,'' or ''flood control'' (no doubt it's now called a cul-de-sac). More an arroyo than a concrete riverbed, the rise on either side was covered by brush and tumbleweed, perfect for making forts and building bonfires. At the top lay train tracks in disuse except for the occasional ''hobo'' tramping a familiar path. Mother would warn us, ''Don't talk to hobos,'' though Depression survivor that she was, she occasionally fed them.</p>

        <p>After the rain would come, Dad would take us by the hand to the top of the bank to watch the awesome rush of muddy water, and floating plants, and we would wonder where those trees would finally rest in the Pacific.</p>
