      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Even as they celebrate their victory in the Supreme Court on campaign finance, lawmakers and advocacy groups are pressing for more changes in election law like updating the presidential public financing system and revamping the Federal Election Commission.</p>
        <p>Already, the reformers are encountering resistance.</p>
        <p>''We have a very substantial agenda we'd like to act on, starting right away,'' Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said after the Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the major provisions of the campaign finance law that he championed with Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.</p>
        <p>Now that the court has cleared some legal obstacles to regulating campaign money, the senators and their allies are trying to build on that. Some even talk about adding restrictions on special interest groups.</p>
        <p>Yet lawmakers and others who opposed the new law insist that no changes are likely in the coming months -- or even years. The opponents said that members of Congress have had enough changes and that, if anything, Republicans and Democrats have their hands full dealing with the changes.</p>
        <p>''There's bipartisan fatigue with the subject,'' the law's leading opponent, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said. ''The new agenda is not likely to go anywhere anytime soon.''</p>
        <p>The new law banned unlimited ''soft money'' contributions to the national parties and restricted political advertising around election time, sending many politicians scrambling to adjust. Democrats, who provided most of the support for the bill in Congress, were hit particularly hard.</p>
        <p>The two parties are still gauging the effects of the law, though it has been in effect for more than a year. Some sections are so complex that members of Congress attended classes to learn the intricacies. Politicians joked that the law's initials, for Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, really stood for Before Campaigning, Retain an Attorney.</p>
        <p>''This was a big wad of reform, and now there's some buyer's remorse,'' a Republican lawyer involved in the issue said. Further changes will have to wait until lawmakers have gone through a few election cycles and can see which improvements are needed, the lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Few people dispute that the Supreme Court decision was a solid victory.</p>
        <p>''The issue has been whether there is political will,'' Jan Witold Baran, a Republican lawyer who opposed the law, said. ''I don't see any change in political will.''</p>
        <p>The issue with perhaps the most support is an effort to revise the financing of presidential campaigns. The system suffered a severe blow when two Democratic presidential hopefuls, Howard Dean and John Kerry, joined President Bush in opting out of it this year. The system gives taxpayers' money to candidates who voluntarily limit spending.</p>
        <p>Critics say that it has fallen out of date since its introduction in 1976 and that it does not offer enough money or spending limits for modern campaigns.</p>
        <p>The candidates' departures make the election this year the first since the program began in which candidates from both parties are operating outside the system in the primaries, free to raise and spend without limits. That development has led to widespread calls for an overhaul.</p>
        <p>Several proposals have been made to revamp the system, including one by Mr. McCain, Mr. Feingold and their allies in the House, Representatives Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, and Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meehan said that the Supreme Court decision energized people who wanted to change the system and that a bill to repair public financing could attract bipartisan support. He added that he did not buy arguments about ''reform fatigue.''</p>
        <p>''They were tired of dealing with this when we got the bill passed,'' he said. ''We move forward.''</p>
        <p>Another proposal, which some lawmakers call a tougher sell, is a bill to reorganize the Federal Election Commission, which oversees how federal campaigns are financed. Mr. McCain has criticized the six-member agency -- three Democratic and three Republican appointees -- as a ''weak and failing agency'' that lacks authority to police campaigns adequately and that has created loopholes in the laws on political money.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain and his colleagues have introduced a bill to replace the commission with a three-member panel with increased enforcement powers.</p>
        <p>Ellen Weintraub, a Democrat who is the chairwoman of the commission, cited a number of problems with the proposal. ''The cure would be worse than the disease,'' Ms. Weintraub said.</p>
        <p>Though she supports the new law and changes to public financing, Ms. Weintraub was skeptical that the Supreme Court decision would pave the way for more changes.</p>
        <p>''I don't know that, with Republicans in control of the House and Senate, they can get passed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Despite the skeptics, many advocacy groups that backed the campaign finance law in its eight-year voyage through the Congress and the courts are enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>''This is very positive for the future of reform,'' Chellie Pingree, president of Common Cause, said. ''This is merely one step.''</p>
        <p>Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, said the decision had ''dramatically altered'' the climate to regulate campaign financing. Proposals like public financing would enjoy a lift, Mr. Wertheimer said, and the door might open to legislation that addresses other issues, too.</p>
        <p>One area may be so-called 527 committees, third-party organizations that collect soft money. Named for the section of the tax code that created them, the committees attracted attention after several Democratic groups began to draw millions of dollars from wealthy donors.</p>
        <p>''We have to do something there,'' Mr. Shays said. ''But I don't know quite what to do. If they are being used as a campaign effort, they should come under the campaign finance law.''</p>
