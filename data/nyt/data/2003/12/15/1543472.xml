        <p>A woman accused of beating her 2-year-old to death for urinating in her pants is scheduled to appear in court today, as inquiries by social-service agencies have begun as to why the woman was given favorable reviews as a mother. Last week, the woman, Uniqua Smith, 20, of Yonkers, was charged with second-degree murder in the death of her daughter, Theresa. Ms. Smith is being held without bail at the county jail. Caseworkers from the Westchester County Department of Social Services and Westhab, a private social-service agency and housing provider, acknowledge writing favorable reports of Ms. Smith. In a meeting this week, the department will convene social workers and law enforcement officials for what is called a fatality review. It is not mandated, but is sometimes convened in special cases. New York State's Office of Children and Family Services will conduct its own investigation, which will take six months. The county is supposed to perform an investigation separate from the fatality review.</p>
