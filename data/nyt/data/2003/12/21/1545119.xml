        <p>Mr. Cullen was arrested on Dec. 12 and, at a Superior Court hearing last Monday, said he would not contest the murder charges. He is being held in lieu of $1 million bail.</p>
        <p>Officials say Mr. Cullen may have killed as many as 15 patients during his 13-month employment at Somerset Medical Center, apparently giving sick patients lethal doses of drugs to end their pain and suffering. Investigators said this may have been a pattern at other hospitals and nursing homes in which he worked in New Jersey and Pennsylvania - possibly as many as 10 places of employment - and are investigating suspicious deaths at those places.</p>
