        <p>FLANDREAU, S.D., Dec. 4  For a few moments on Thursday, most of South Dakotas delegation to Washington occupied an unlikely space: a cramped, baby-blue courtroom in this isolated farming town of 2,376.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>For a few moments on Thursday, most of South Dakota's delegation to Washington occupied an unlikely space: a cramped, baby-blue courtroom in this isolated farming town of 2,376.</p>
        <p>Senator Tom Daschle, a Democrat who is the minority leader, sat on the witness stand of the Moody County Courthouse, his hands clasped casually before him. Across the room, Representative Bill Janklow, a Republican and this state's only member of the House, listened at the defendant's table.</p>
        <p>In a way, what Mr. Daschle came here to say was small, no different than what a waitress and an intern had come to say: No, they had not seen Mr. Janklow eat anything one Saturday in August, the day Mr. Janklow ran a stop sign, leaving a motorcyclist dead. All were summoned to Mr. Janklow's second-degree manslaughter trial to corroborate his defense team's contention that Mr. Janklow, a diabetic, failed to eat all day and could have become disoriented by low blood sugar as he drove.</p>
        <p>But it was clear on this snowy Thursday afternoon, from the craning necks in the jury box and the silent attention in the elbow-to-elbow audience, that it really did not matter so much exactly what Mr. Daschle said. The scene alone was enough: the state's two most towering political figures -- whose long friendship, despite their opposing parties, had always puzzled some -- before them, one standing trial, the other subpoenaed by his defense.</p>
        <p>''I didn't see him eat, no,'' testified Mr. Daschle, who had attended a midday ceremony honoring Korean War veterans in Aberdeen along with Mr. Janklow on Aug. 16, a day that ended with the fatal accident.</p>
        <p>Over objections from prosecutors, Mr. Daschle was also asked whether he had formed an opinion about Mr. Janklow's truthfulness over their 30 years of acquaintance.</p>
        <p>''I think he's a very truthful person,'' the three-term senator told the jurors, all of whom come from here, Mr. Janklow's home county. ''We've had a close relationship both personally as well as professionally. I have appreciated that friendship and that relationship all of these years.''</p>
        <p>If convicted of the felony charge, Mr. Janklow, 64, could be sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison. But the outcome of his trial, now in its fourth day, could also realign the state's political matchups in 2004. Both Mr. Janklow and Mr. Daschle would be up for election -- and what happens here could affect both of their races, political scientists say.</p>
        <p>So far, Mr. Janklow has not said what he will do when his seat comes up next year. House rules say those convicted of felonies with prison sentences of two years or more should not vote.</p>
        <p>Already, opponents including Stephanie Herseth, a Democratic lawyer who ran against Mr. Janklow in 2002, have talked of running for his seat next fall. And some analysts speculate that John Thune, a former Republican representative who was being courted to take on Mr. Daschle in 2004, might run instead for Mr. Janklow's seat -- if it is empty.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, the outcome of this trial will have impact on all of that,'' said William D. Richardson, chairman of the political science department at the University of South Dakota in Vermillion. ''Until this trial is answered, there are so many pieces to fall into place before we'll know who runs for what.''</p>
        <p>Long before the accident, some supporters hinted that Mr. Janklow might run for Mr. Daschle's Senate seat in 2004. But that idea hinged on the notion that Mr. Daschle would run for the presidency, or not run at all; few believed the pair would ever run directly against each other.</p>
        <p>In a state known less for strong party alliances than for allegiances to individuals, the roots of the friendship between Mr. Daschle and Mr. Janklow run deep.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, Mr. Daschle faced allegations that he had misused his influence in an investigation of the fatal crash of a Rapid City charter plane. Mr. Janklow publicly and vehemently defended Mr. Daschle. Mr. Daschle, in turn, sent a long thank-you letter to Mr. Janklow. The friendship was sealed.</p>
        <p>But if the criminal charges against Mr. Janklow created a test to that friendship, putting Mr. Daschle in the somewhat awkward position of testifying on his behalf, that was not apparent on Thursday. Staff members from Mr. Daschle's office said they did not anticipate any repercussions from the connection to Mr. Janklow or the testimony. Still, they stressed to reporters that the senator had not appeared in court on his own, but had been subpoenaed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle's testimony lasted fewer than five minutes, about the same as several others who were called by the defense on Thursday to say that Mr. Janklow had not eaten the day of the crash.</p>
        <p>Angela Cleberg, a waitress in Aberdeen, said Mr. Janklow had skipped his eggs and meat breakfast that morning when it took too long -- 15 minutes -- to arrive. Harvey Jewett, a business leader in Aberdeen, said Mr. Janklow had skipped the caramel rolls at their mid-morning meeting to discuss a pheasant hunting event. And Leslie Simdorn, an intern for the congressman, said her boss did not eat the barbecue at the Korean veterans' event because he was worried about messing up his clothes before he gave his speech.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors, who finished their case on Wednesday, contend that Mr. Janklow, who uses insulin to control his diabetes, was not disoriented or suffering from low blood sugar the day that Randy Scott, a motorcyclist from Minnesota, was killed. They say Mr. Janklow was simply speeding home, as he had many times.</p>
        <p>As snow piled up on the dark streets outside the courthouse Thursday evening, Mr. Daschle was ushered off in a sport utility vehicle. He was headed to Sioux Falls, about 40 miles away, where he was to be host of a $100-a-head fund-raising dinner for his campaign, in honor of his 25th year in Congress.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle's arrival in the courtroom, across from Mr. Janklow, left only one of the state's Washington leaders somewhere other than here.</p>
        <p>The state's other senator, Tim Johnson, a Democrat, was also in South Dakota on Thursday, his spokeswoman, Julianne Fisher, said. He was expected to attend Mr. Daschle's reception in Sioux Falls on Thursday evening, then attend a series of meetings on Friday. No trips, she said, were planned to Flandreau.</p>
