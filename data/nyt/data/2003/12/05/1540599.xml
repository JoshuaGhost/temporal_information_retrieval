      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The butchering of more than half a million Rwandan Tutsis, roughly 70 percent of Rwanda's entire Tutsi population, during the spring of 1994 is one of the clearest cases of genocide since World War II. Regrettably, the international community did little to stop it. Now, belatedly, it has taken an important and welcome step, with Wednesday's conviction by a special international court of three leading organizers of that slaughter.</p>
        <p>The three convicted men were not generals, militia commanders or politicians, but media executives. Hassan Ngeze owned a newspaper, Kangura, that, with deadly effect, urged its Hutu readers to murder Tutsis. Ferdinand Nahimana and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza ran a radio station, RTLM, that actually directed gangs of killers to specific Tutsi targets. Though words, not machetes, were their main weapons, they are at least as guilty as those who carried out their murderous instructions. Mr. Ngeze and Mr. Nahimana, who have already said they intend to appeal, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Mr. Barayagwiza's sentence was 27 years.</p>

        <p>The butchering of more than half a million Rwandan Tutsis, roughly 70 percent of Rwanda's entire Tutsi population, during the spring of 1994 is one of the clearest cases of genocide since World War II. Regrettably, the international community did little to stop it. Now, belatedly, it has taken an important and welcome step, with Wednesday's conviction by a special international court of three leading organizers of that slaughter.</p>
        <p>The three convicted men were not generals, militia commanders or politicians, but media executives. Hassan Ngeze owned a newspaper, Kangura, that, with deadly effect, urged its Hutu readers to murder Tutsis. Ferdinand Nahimana and Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza ran a radio station, RTLM, that actually directed gangs of killers to specific Tutsi targets. Though words, not machetes, were their main weapons, they are at least as guilty as those who carried out their murderous instructions. Mr. Ngeze and Mr. Nahimana, who have already said they intend to appeal, were sentenced to life imprisonment. Mr. Barayagwiza's sentence was 27 years.</p>
        <p>These verdicts pose no threat to journalistic free speech, as defense lawyers tried to argue. RTLM was not offering drive-time political chatter -- it was acting as a radio dispatcher of murder, knowingly helping squads of killers locate victims. Kangura's role was marginally less direct. It promoted mass murder to a population that then murdered hundreds of thousands of Tutsis.</p>
        <p>All three men were rightly found guilty of genocide, incitement to genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide and crimes against humanity.</p>
        <p>The international court that did so has not performed as well as it should have during its nine-year history. Despite a large staff and budget, it has produced only 17 convictions, including these three. It has not investigated charges of revenge killings committed by Tutsis, a sensitive area that Rwanda's government, now dominated by Tutsis, wants to control.</p>
        <p>There is a risk that dictators will try to exploit the conviction of these media executives as a pretext for prosecuting legitimate journalists who simply present facts and opinions governments would rather not have discussed. Perversely, that risk exists in Rwanda itself. Last month Rwandan authorities detained six journalists and confiscated copies of their weekly newspaper, saying it was ''inciting sectarian behavior.'' The articles asked why some ranking army officers were being removed from active duty and questioned the use of taxpayer money to send one of these soon-to-be-relieved officers to a training course abroad. Laws like Rwanda's incitement statutes damage free expression and democracy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ngeze, Mr. Nahimana and Mr. Barayagwiza were not challenging government propaganda, exposing corruption or expanding political debate. They were organizing the brutal physical extermination of a whole people. Their convictions demonstrate that the international community will demand justice for those who committed such a crime against all humanity.</p>
