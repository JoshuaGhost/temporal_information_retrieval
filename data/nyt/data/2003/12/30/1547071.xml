        <p>RITZ--Esther Leah Medalie. Born May 16, 1918, died in Milwaukee, WI, December 26, 2003. Preceded in death by husband Maurice Ritz. Survived by sons David and Peter; daughter, Joyce Kemp; sister, Louise Bloom; brother, Yale Medalie; five grandchildren, and many nieces, nephews and cousins. A Memorial Service is planned for spring. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to the political candidates and charities of your choice.</p>
        <p>RITZ--Esther Leah. It is with deep sadness that we mark the passing of Esther Leah Ritz, Chair of Jewish Community Centers Association/ JWB from 1982 to 1986. Her high intelligence, honesty and passion for the JCC Movement and the Florence G. Heller Resource Center, and her profound concern for Israel and the Jewish people, made an impact on all who knew her. We have lost a devoted friend. Edward H. Kaplan, Chair Allan Finkelstein, President</p>
