        <p>A Puzzle, Growing on Clematis</p>
        <p>Q. This summer a pod like a small vanilla bean appeared at the top of my clematis vines. The seeds inside look like pine nuts. Are they clematis seeds, and if so, how do I plant them?</p>
        <p>A. The beanlike aspects suggest that the growth was some kind of legume that climbed your vines, but whatever it was, it definitely wasn't a clematis, said Susan Austin, who grows roughly 200 varieties at Completely Clematis in Ipswich, Mass., www.clematisnursery.com or (978) 356-3197. Not all clematis seed heads are alike, she said, but all are airy, delicate puffs. And the seeds are small, slender and nearly flat.</p>

        <p>A Puzzle, Growing on Clematis</p>
        <p>Q. This summer a pod like a small vanilla bean appeared at the top of my clematis vines. The seeds inside look like pine nuts. Are they clematis seeds, and if so, how do I plant them?</p>
        <p>A. The beanlike aspects suggest that the growth was some kind of legume that climbed your vines, but whatever it was, it definitely wasn't a clematis, said Susan Austin, who grows roughly 200 varieties at Completely Clematis in Ipswich, Mass., www.clematisnursery.com or (978) 356-3197. Not all clematis seed heads are alike, she said, but all are airy, delicate puffs. And the seeds are small, slender and nearly flat.</p>
        <p>Using seeds to grow more clematis can be either quite a challenge or as easy as growing annuals, depending on the species, she said. The beautiful native C. texensis can take years to germinate, and large-flowered hybrids are notoriously difficult.</p>
        <p>But the vigorous C. tangutica, from western China, is very obliging. It germinates rapidly and often flowers, if modestly, the same year it is sown. Its nodding yellow bells are small, but once plants are established they can be covered with blossoms. And the seedpods are as pretty as flowers, extending the show.</p>
        <p>Seeds for the species C. tangutica are sold by J. L. Hudson, Star Route 2, Box 337, La Honda, Calif. 94020 or www.jlhudsonseeds.net. The hybrid version Radar Love is sold by Park Seed, www.parkseed.com or (800) 845-3369.</p>
        <p>Rutabagas, but Hold the Wax</p>
        <p>Q. Are rutabagas a Northern or a Southern tradition? We had them as kids in Ohio, but I don't know whether they were from my father's side (New England) or my mother's (New Orleans). Also, why are they waxed, and is it worthwhile to grow your own to avoid the wax?</p>
        <p>A. Rutabagas are also known as Swede turnips, or just plain Swedes, which should answer your first question. They are traditional in short-summer climates because, like potatoes and winter squash, they can be stored a long time with minimal loss of quality. As one who feels that rutabagas don't have much quality to lose, I am tempted to say they are waxed to indicate they are inedible, but in truth, the thick coating -- paraffin, derived from petroleum -- is there to extend shelf life. It prevents bruising, reduces moisture loss and keeps out spoilage organisms.</p>
        <p>The rutabaga (Brassica napobrassica) is moderately easy to grow, more difficult than the sweet turnip, less challenging than cabbage. Growing your own would enable you to avoid pesticides, and if you have a skilled hand with Brassicas, it might taste a little better. But if your consumption of rutabaga is primarily ceremonial, avoiding the wax is likely to be more trouble than it's worth.</p>
        <p>More on Cat Droppings</p>
        <p>A reader points out that a reply in this column on Nov. 20 about dealing with cat droppings in the garden did not specifically address the dangers of Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that droppings can carry. Though rarely harmful to the general population, it can be dangerous, or even fatal, to human fetuses or to people with weakened immune systems.</p>
        <p>It is hard to kill T. gondii in soil, but Dr. J. P. Dubey, a senior scientist in the United States Agriculture Department who specializes in the prevention of toxoplasmosis, said that ''the most efficient way to do it'' would be to follow the general advice in the earlier column (cover the soil with heavy landscape fabric to exclude cats for several months, then raise the soil temperature by removing the fabric, watering well and covering with clear plastic for four to six weeks). He said you could also gather the droppings and burn them, but wear gloves and a mask.</p>
