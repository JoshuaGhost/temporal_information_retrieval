        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''Gay Ex-Officers Say 'Don't Ask' Doesn't Work'' (news article, Dec. 10), you noted that three retired military officers -- two generals and an admiral, who have been among the most senior uniformed officers to criticize the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy -- disclosed that they are gay.</p>
        <p>Your article proves your headline wrong. The policy does work. How else could they have had successful military careers? In fact, they had it even rougher than current gays do since, unless they did not know they were gay when they joined the military, they had to lie to join, as the ''don't ask'' policy has only been around 10 years.</p>
