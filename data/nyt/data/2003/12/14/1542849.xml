        <p>David Rieff article on Iraqification, notion that what is needed to improve situation is quick transfer of control over security and political process to Iraqis; to some Americans, idea carries whiff of defeat, while others see it as sensible response to difficulties encountered following ouster of Saddam Hussein; some Bush administration officials insist it was always at heart of planning for postwar Iraq; there is little question that it has become reigning idea about how Iraq's future will be organized but, like many big ideas in Washington, problem comes when different people use term to mean different things; several possible versions Iraqification described; photo (M)</p>

        <p>In Washington, it is often assumed that the answer to every crisis is to be found in a Big Idea -- ''the vision thing,'' as President George Herbert Walker Bush once called it, somewhat dismissively. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, so administrations abhor an absence of ideas (or at least convenient catch phrases). Muddling through, which is the reality of politics, rarely seems enough.</p>
        <p>Nowhere has this been more true than in the realm of foreign policy. Iraq has been the perfect example. President George H.W. Bush's big idea about Iraq, rolling back Saddam Hussein, gave way to President Clinton's big idea about Iraq, containment, which gave way to President George W. Bush's big idea about Iraq, Iraqi liberation. But as events have shown, the liberation of Iraq alone hasn't solved the problems there, so as is often the case in Washington, one reigning idea has gradually transformed into another reigning big idea: Iraqification, the notion that what is needed to improve the situation there (and bring American troops home) is a quick transfer of control over security and the political process to the Iraqis.</p>

        <p>In Washington, it is often assumed that the answer to every crisis is to be found in a Big Idea -- ''the vision thing,'' as President George Herbert Walker Bush once called it, somewhat dismissively. Just as nature abhors a vacuum, so administrations abhor an absence of ideas (or at least convenient catch phrases). Muddling through, which is the reality of politics, rarely seems enough.</p>
        <p>Nowhere has this been more true than in the realm of foreign policy. Iraq has been the perfect example. President George H.W. Bush's big idea about Iraq, rolling back Saddam Hussein, gave way to President Clinton's big idea about Iraq, containment, which gave way to President George W. Bush's big idea about Iraq, Iraqi liberation. But as events have shown, the liberation of Iraq alone hasn't solved the problems there, so as is often the case in Washington, one reigning idea has gradually transformed into another reigning big idea: Iraqification, the notion that what is needed to improve the situation there (and bring American troops home) is a quick transfer of control over security and the political process to the Iraqis.</p>
        <p>For many Americans old enough to remember the Vietnam War, the term Iraqification carries the same baggage of defeat and withdrawal that Vietnamization did a generation ago. For others, it simply seems like a sensible response to the difficulties the United States has encountered in Iraq in the aftermath of the ousting of Saddam Hussein -- a sensible midterm correction or readjustment of America's original postwar plan. Still others, notably within the Bush administration, insist that Iraqification was at the heart of the U.S. government's planning for a postwar Iraq from the start, even if the public emphasis had been elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But if opinions are mixed about what, if anything, the recent enthusiasm in Washington for Iraqification tells us about America's success or failure in Iraq, there is little question that it has become the reigning idea about how Iraq's future will be organized. It is an idea, however, with a contradiction at its core.</p>
        <p>The problem is less that different people use Iraqification to pass different judgments on the war but that the idea means so many different things to so many different people. In this way it is again like a lot of big ideas in Washington -- a term everyone uses while obscuring different, even antithetical approaches. Here are some possibilities for what Iraqification might look like. While it is impossible to say which will eventually prevail, each of them can be supported by trends and facts on the ground in Iraq today.</p>
        <p>According to the gloomiest of these possibilities, Iraqification does play out like Vietnamization. The U.S. raises an Iraqi army, but that army has no real legitimacy among the Iraqi people as a whole (raising an army before establishing a political structure that can command its loyalty is always risky). As a result, Iraqification fails to quell the guerrilla insurgency under way in Baghdad, the so-called Sunni triangle and the northern city of Mosul, and the U.S. is faced with the choice of either withdrawing, presumably on domestic political grounds, or committing huge new forces to what would in effect be the second part of the war.</p>
        <p>Another version of Iraqification involves cutting a deal with some senior Iraqi official from the Saddam Hussein era and allowing him to rule -- a ''housebroken Saddam'' in the words of the Cato Institute's Ted Galen Carpenter. This idea is by no means completely fanciful. Before the war, some administration officials hinted that if Saddam Hussein gave up power, this would satisfy Washington's desire for regime change. Presumably, such a figure would be able to quell the uprising in the Sunni triangle.</p>
        <p>An equally defeatist but perhaps less morally unpalatable Iraqification, one that involves Iraqification through abolition, was most recently suggested by a former president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Leslie Gelb. It calls for the partition of Iraq into three states -- one Kurdish, one Sunni and one Shiite. With each major constituent group in Iraq having its own state, fighting would presumably cease and the United States could exit from Iraq with its own security concerns met and a relatively stable situation on the ground.</p>
        <p>Another version of Iraqification being considered in Washington is for the U.S. to come to some sort of understanding with the Shiite hierarchy and effectively concede that not only would the Shiites dominate a post-Saddam-Hussein Iraq -- something that is probably inevitable anyway given the fact that they make up about 60 percent of the population and that 15 percent or so more live in a semiautonomous Kurdistan -- but also that Iraq's destiny is to become a moderate theocracy; in other words, not Iran under Khomeini, but not Turkey either.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is the option that most Iraqi exiles, many people in the Bush administration (particularly the neoconservatives) and certainly many Iraqis hoped for: that Iraqification will actually mean the installation not just of representative democracy in Iraq (the Shiite state option does this as well), but also of a genuinely pluralistic and nontheological state. The rights of religious and ethnic minorities (including secular people) would be respected, and women would be free not to submit to the dictates of religious authorities. In other words, an Iraq that, if it does not exactly become the Czech Republic, does allow its citizens at least as many freedoms as those enjoyed by people in Lebanon or Turkey.</p>
        <p>These variants of Iraqification may indeed be incompatible in theory. In practice, of course, big ideas in Washington often evolve so fast that their real role is to convince the public that something is being done to address a problem -- until the next big idea comes along, that is.</p>
