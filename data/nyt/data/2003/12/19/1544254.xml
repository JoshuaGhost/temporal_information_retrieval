        <p>''AMAHL AND THE NIGHT VISITORS.'' Another year, another ''Amahl,'' as the Little Orchestra Society presents its 23rd annual performance of Gian Carlo Menotti's popular operatic tale of a handicapped boy who is cured by a miracle. Matthew Conrad, 12, stars as Amahl, and Kathleen Clawson, a mezzo-soprano, sings the role of his mother. The group's music director, Dino Anagnost, conducts.

        <p>''IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA.'' On Wednesday night a new cast took over all the major roles in the Metropolitan Opera's attractive 1982 production of Rossini's ebullient ''Barbiere di Siviglia.'' Most of the advance buzz, no doubt, was about the exciting young Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Flórez. Count Almaviva is already a trademark role for Mr. Flórez and, as expected, he was splendid, tossing off Rossinian roulades and runs with agility and exuberance, singing with sweet tone and pliant phrasing. That he's such a dashing and agile actor just adds to the fun. Not many tenors can jump atop a table in one leap, as he did. As Rosina, the essential soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, who is having an exceptionally fine Met season, sang exquisitely and again proved herself a delightfully natural comic actress. Alfonso Antoniozzi, a wiry-framed and vocally robust Italian bass-baritone with wryly understated comic instincts, made a standout Met debut as Dr. Bartolo. And the veteran baritone Dwayne Croft was a hardy and winning Figaro. Bruno Campanella conducted. Everyone returns for tomorrow evening's performance. Tomorrow night at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $35 to $205 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''IL CAMPANELLO DI NOTTE.'' Tonight you can see the final performance of the New York Chamber Opera's production of a lesser-known but quite charming Donizetti one-act opera buffa, ''Il Campanello di Notte'' (''The Night Bell''). The story tells of an elderly apothecary who has unwisely married a woman too young for him. Her former lover, who is still smitten, interrupts the wedding night by constantly ringing the bell and demanding emergency prescriptions. The cast includes Marco Nistico (a tenor in his New York debut), Sarah Miller (soprano) and Stefano de Peppo (bass). The company's artistic director, Lucy Arner, conducts. Tonight at 8, Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $25 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''LA JUIVE.'' The tenor Neil Shicoff was the driving force behind the Metropolitan Opera's decision to present its first production since 1936 of Halévy's French grand opera ''La Juive.'' Once a repertory staple, this neglected work is a lyrically rich, dramatically sweeping and affectingly dignified opera. Its timely story of animosity between Jews and Christians in the city of Constance, Switzerland, in 1414, turns on the illicit love affair between Léopold, the married imperial prince, and Rachel, the daughter (or so we think at first) of the Jewish goldsmith Eléazar, a man completely embittered by the prejudice his people face. Mr. Shicoff gives an impassioned performance as Eléazar. The soprano Soile Isokoski brings a cool Nordic voice and arresting intensity to the role of Rachel. The bass Ferruccio Furlanetto is deeply moving as Cardinal Brogni, who tries to reconcile the Christians and Jews but is powerless in the face of such ingrained bigotry. Unfortunately, the production by Günter Krämer is a modern-dress, unit-set, muddle-headed affair laden with symbolism and at times just plain silly. Marcello Viotti conducts. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000. Tickets: $33 to $195 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>''DIE FLEDERMAUS.'' Traditional holiday fare is served on a small scale at the endearing, petite and ever-vital Amato Opera. This Christmas its tiny stage is overfilled with colorful sets for this classic Johann Strauss Viennese operetta. The theater's 107 seats are usually also filled, making this, in general, a tough ticket. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Amato Opera, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 228-8200. Tickets: $30; students, 65+ and children under 12, $25 (Anne Midgette).</p>
        <p>''LA PÉRICHOLE.'' Sending up opera tradition is a hallmark of Offenbach's opéras-bouffes. In ''La Périchole'' we get the exotic locale (Peru) and the impoverished street singer (Périchole) beloved of a nobleman. Michael Capasso, the founder and director of Dicapo Opera, has helped translate a new English version of the book, with lyrics by Gene Scheer. The opera is now in its final three performances in the company's intimate underground theater, with Luz del Alba Rubio in the title role; Elaine Rinaldi conducts. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, Sunday afternoon at 4, Dicapo Opera, 184 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 288-9438. Tickets: $47.50 (Midgette).</p>
        <p>Classical Music</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while taking in striking views of the city lights. This weekend the violinist Mark Peskanov and the pianist Olga Vinokur chart a course for 19th-century Vienna with an all-Schubert concert tonight (including the C major Fantasy) and an all-Beethoven program tomorrow and Sunday (including the Piano Trio in E flat, Op. 70, No. 2, for which they will be joined by the cellist Priscilla Lee). Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35; students, $20 (Eichler).</p>
        <p>EARLY MUSIC NEW YORK. This is the new name of the longstanding New York Ensemble for Early Music, directed by Frederick Renz. The group has made a series of seasonal recordings on its own label, Ex Cathedra, corresponding to a series of annual concerts: ''A Medieval Christmas,'' ''A Renaissance Christmas'' and ''A Baroque Christmas.'' This year it's the turn of the Renaissance, with works by Busnois, Dufay, Praetorius, Victoria and others. Sunday at 3 p.m., Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 280-0330. Sold out, but returns may be available at the box office (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>FOUR NATIONS ENSEMBLE. For those who prefer the sounds of the holidays rendered on gut strings, this period-instrument ensemble, along with the soprano Kirsten Blase, will perform works by Purcell and Biber, as well as traditional carols. Sunday night at 6:30 and 8:30, Medieval Sculpture Hall, Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 570-3949. Tickets: $60 (Eichler).</p>
        <p>I GIULLARI DI PIAZZA. This freewheeling group, led by Alessandra Belloni, revives its production of ''La Cantata dei Pastori'' (''The Shepherds' Cantata''), a 17th-century Neapolitan Christmas play. Written by Andrea Perrucci and adapted over the centuries, it tells of demons' machinations to prevent the birth of Jesus, which are ultimately foiled by the Archangel Gabriel. Seen more than a decade ago, this rustic mix of ancient folkish music and slapstick humor with an overlay of the stylized commedia dell'arte tradition offered many entertaining moments, though it also seemed overlong and repetitive. Perhaps the production has sharpened with time. Tomorrow and Sunday at 2 p.m., St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 877-3399. Tickets: $20; students and 65+, $15; children under 12, $12 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>LIONHEART. This all-male vocal sextet, which specializes in medieval music (with periodic forays into contemporary works), is presenting ''Tydings Trew,'' its program of English carols, hymns and motets from that distant time. Included are antique songs that commemorate not only Christmas, but also the various feasts (those of St. Stephen, the Holy Innocents and the Epiphany) that take place from Dec. 25 to Jan. 6. Sunday at 1 and 3 p.m., the Cloisters, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 650-2290. Tickets: $35 (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>MASTERWORK CHORUS. This group was the first I heard perform Handel's ''Messiah'' in New York, in the early 1970's. David Randolph conducted, trying, if memory serves, to miniaturize huge forces in an awkward nod to the early-music movement, which was then gathering steam. In 1999 Mr. Randolph's successor, David Briskin, bade the group farewell with a tighter, more coherent effort: one of the better ''Messiah'' performances of that season, well focused in pitch and rhythm. The group is now directed by Andrew Megill, whom I have not heard in the work. Tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: afternoon, $20 to $75; evening, $20 to $100 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>MUSICA SACRA. As de rigueur for this time of year as eggnog and mistletoe, Handel's ''Messiah'' returns for its annual performance by Musica Sacra under the baton of Richard Westenburg. Connoisseurs of the Christmas spirit will each have their favorite version of the oratorio, but for many, Mr. Westenburg's is up there near the top. This year's soloists are Marvis Martin, Tracy Watson, Mark Bleeke and Michael Dean. Sunday night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $18 to $110 (Eichler).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>ACCADDE DOMANI: BUTOH, FLAMENCO AND RITUALS. Shigeko Suga combines Japanese butoh dance, Spanish flamenco dance, poetry by Ernest Abuba and various chants and songs in an adaptation of a play by Franca Rame and Dario Fo about a German terrorist who was stabbed in jail. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8, La MaMa First Floor Theater, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710. Tickets: $15 (Jack Anderson).</p>
        <p>ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER. This vibrant troupe is celebrating its 45th anniversary.

        <p>''A CELEBRATION OF GEORGE BALANCHINE: SELECTED TELEVISION WORK.'' This irresistible-sounding screening series, one of many tributes to the choreographer during his centenary, is drawn from television shows of the 1950's. The first segment, which runs through Dec. 28, shows Balanchine giving a tour of the School of American Ballet and working on a ballet, ''Yankee Doodle,'' as well as choreographing a pas de deux from ''The Nutcracker,'' danced by Tanaquil LeClercq and Jacques d'Amboise.
