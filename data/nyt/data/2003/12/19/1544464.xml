        <p>Polytechnic University in Brooklyn announced this week that Dr. David C. Chang would step down as president in June 2005, after 11 years in the post. He will become a professor of electrical engineering and will serve as chancellor until June 2008. Under Dr. Chang, 62, the university raised $275 million in a capital campaign, including $175 million left by a former professor, Donald Othmer, and his wife, Mildred. Polytechnic used some of the money to expand its campus at the MetroTech Center. But when enrollment fell to 3,300 from 3,500, the university had to make cuts. The endowment is now about $120 million, up from $13 million when Dr. Chang became president.</p>
