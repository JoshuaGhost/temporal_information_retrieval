        <p>THEY are reluctant to acknowledge it, but the religion-based Jewish Community Centers and Y.M.C.A.'s are engaged in a battle for the fitness dollar in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>These two organizations have long been the dominant players in a billion-dollar industry that capitalizes on sweat and muscle, and they continue to evolve even as smaller gyms and workout programs seem to be popping up at every other intersection.</p>
        <p>Jewish Community Centers used to be known as the Young Men's Hebrew Association until around 20 years ago. ''The old name eliminated women and older people,'' said Alan Mann, an executive vice president at the J.C.C. Association of North America in New York, ''and not many people identify themselves as Hebrew anymore.''</p>
        <p>Nowadays, the well-toned, the flabby and all body types in between seem to be lining up -- regardless of faith -- at 16 impressively appointed J.C.C. facilities around the state, which is second in concentration only to New York.</p>
        <p>Like the Y's, the J.C.C.'s are more than pools, saunas, racquetball courts and neat rows of nautilus machines arranged in mirrored, air-conditioned fitness rooms. Though Y's are more ingrained in the national consciousness, J.C.C.'s function in the same community catch-all capacity: For families with young children, they offer preschools, summer camps and after-school care. For retirees, there are socials, classes and lectures. School-age children can join swim leagues or soccer or basketball teams; teens can sequester themselves in their own on-site hangout centers; and singles, in some locations, are matched at mixers and through in-house dating services. Guest speakers -- authors, politicians and other luminaries -- are booked regularly for sessions open to all members.</p>
        <p>Both organizations also share longevity: the country's first Y.M.C.A. was established in Boston in 1851. and the first Y.M.H.A. came a year earlier in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>But unlike the Y's, the J.C.C.'s adhere to an image-consciousness consistent with the times.</p>
        <p>Think Kmart versus Saks. J.C.C.'s operate like a high-profile brand, upholding carefully laid-out standards to meet the demands of a marketplace teeming with increasingly discriminating fitness buffs.</p>
        <p>Recent visits to several locations showed that where a Y employee might scan a member's card wordlessly, for example, front-desk clerks at the Jewish centers make a practice of acknowledging members by name. Where Y's hang vinyl shower curtains in their locker rooms without concern for whether they reach from one stall wall to the other, cloth curtains hang securely, with ample drape, at the J.C.C.'s.</p>
        <p>And then there is the pool smell: At Y's, its fetid dampness is famously pervasive. At J.C.C.'s, air-filtration systems eliminate it and also clear the air of the sweaty-sock odor that clings to most anyplace that regularly plays host to hordes of preschoolers tumbling on mats.</p>
        <p>Despite their differences and head-to-head competition, both groups claim mutual respect and harmonious relationships within communities in which they both operate.</p>
        <p>''It may be na√Øve of me not to, but we don't consider J.C.C.'s competitors,'' said Melanie Roth, who trains volunteers and employees and advises on marketing at 27 of the state's 41 Y's as an employee of the YMCA-USA, based in Chicago.</p>
        <p>J.C.C. spokesmen echo that thought. ''Although our goals, services and programs are similar to the Y's, we do not view them competitively because the communities we target are primarily different,'' said Avi Lewinson, the executive director of the Palisades J.C.C.</p>
        <p>But whether in metropolitan Jewish hubs like eastern Bergen County, Cherry Hill and West Orange or in less Jewish regions like Scotch Plains and Edison, the J.C.C.'s are obviously eclipsing the Y's in customers and customer devotion.</p>
        <p>Jenifer Wirtshafter, a member of the Central New Jersey J.C.C. in Scotch Plains, contends that ''Coldwell Banker didn't sell me my house'' in Westfield, ''the full-service J.C.C. nearby did.''</p>
        <p>The J.C.C. in Cherry Hill has 11,000 members, while the Camden County Y, which includes two branches, one in nearby Voorhees and the other in Camden, has a combined membership of 3,800.</p>
        <p>J.C.C. Metrowest, which includes centers in West Orange and Whippany, has a combined 16,000 members, far above that of the nearest Y's: the West Essex Y in Livingston, near West Orange, which serves 4,800, and the recently refurbished Morris Center Y.M.C.A. in Cedar Knolls, with 5,700 members.</p>
        <p>And the J.C.C. in Bridgewater has 5,000 members, while the Bridgewater Y, encompassing separate buildings in Bridgewater, Somerville and Hillsborough, has a total of 4,600.</p>
        <p>In a reversal, the Y.M.C.A./Y.W.C.A. in Ridgewood, which serves most of Bergen, Passaic and Rockland counties, has 14,000 members, surpassing the 11,000 members of the J.C.C. on the Palisades, in Tenafly. The annual rate for a family membership at the Y, however, is $540, while the J.C.C. on the Palisades is $300 steeper.</p>
        <p>A tour of the Tenafly grounds illustrates why.</p>
        <p>Reaching the J.C.C. is like arriving at a major destination. A long, winding driveway leads up a hill, past a marquee announcing coming events and to the center of the 34-acre property, a 175,000-square-foot building surrounded by gardens and the kind of statues typically found outside a small-city art museum.</p>
        <p>An off-duty police officer monitors the front door, which constantly buzzes open and shut for young mothers in spandex, elderly members in windbreakers and briefcase-toting business people, freshly showered post-workout.</p>
        <p>Those who aren't headed toward the sprawling parking lot make their way toward a restaurant where kosher bagels and coffee keep the morning crowd lingering or -- if they're not attending a class, playing squash or racquetball, swimming or shopping at the gift boutique -- to one of two gyms.</p>
        <p>Membership here costs $840 for a family and $380 for a single adult. But 550 of the members have chosen to pay an additional $790 to join this location's Seiden Health Center, the fitness equivalent of a restaurant's V.I.P. room. As these well-heeled members hoist free weights or huff on stationary bikes, an employee in track pants and a crisp polo shirt circles the floor, passing out cups of water to the perspiring and panting as if they were hors d'oeuvres. When their workout is over, these members can elect to hit their own private sauna or whirlpool, pick at a complimentary brunch or choose an aromatherapy treatment in the members-only steam room.</p>
        <p>Downstairs, few of the 10,450 members who choose to work out at the regular gym would consider themselves second-class citizens. Here there are elliptical machines to spare, even during the busy hours of the gym, and a wall of television sets help amply spaced treadmill runners maintain their strides.</p>
        <p>''I'll go downstairs sometimes and work out too,'' Vivian Kestenbaum of Englewood, a Seiden member, said recently after racing a friend around the indoor track. ''I spend a lot of time here, and it's a nice change of scenery.'' In addition, she sees people she know from the center's preschool there and ''It's a good place for me to book playdates,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mann, the national executive, and Mr. Lewinson, the executive director of the Palisades J.C.C., concede that the Tenafly location is probably the state's most well-appointed. But they don't apologize for its posh or doubt its affordability.</p>
        <p>The Y's and the J.C.C.'s are part of state, national and international networks, but in both organizations each location sets its own membership dues. Representatives of both organizations say that their fees, as well as their amenities, are reflective of their communities -- the more affluent the region, the pricier and more deluxe the facility. But the J.C.C. of Central New Jersey, which serves Scotch Plains, Westfield, Clark, Fanwood and Berkeley Heights, and the Fanwood-Scotch Plains Y, which is almost directly across the street in Scotch Plains, put that premise to the test.</p>
        <p>In a fairly middle-class area, they would be expected to have similar amenities and similar fees. But at the 26,000-square-foot J.C.C., which was remodeled in 1998 to enhance the fitness studios, teen center and pool, the dues are $665 a year for a family. At the Y, which is almost the same size and was remodeled a decade ago to include a new gym and new adult locker rooms but lacks small perquisites like towel service and blow-dryers, the same membership package costs $747.</p>
        <p>J.C.C.'s substantially outperform Y's at fund-raising, which enables them to fit the profile of gyms that Chris Ochart, general manager of the Gold's Gym in Whippany, says attracts fitness connoisseurs.</p>
        <p>''People come here shopping for a gym a lot,'' he said, ''and usually the deciding factor is price, but mostly they think of Y's as a place for the family, for kids who want to play basketball. And Y's are about the pool, too.'' The benefit of a private gym like Gold's or the Whippany J.C.C., he said, is the variety and the quantity of machines. ''We have volume, and with volume comes convenience,'' he said. ''You don't have to wait all the time.''</p>
        <p>J.C.C. fitness coordinators budget for equipment upgrades and latest-craze classes like Pilates at least annually, and when laying out their plans ''some of it is pure consumerism,'' said Les Cohen, executive director of the Cherry Hill J.C.C. ''If we want to stay competitive with private health clubs -- and we do -- we have to make sure we have plenty of treadmills and ellipticals,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For the remodeling of the J.C.C. in Scotch Plains five years ago, the Central New Jersey Jewish Federation contributed $6 million, said Lois Altschul, assistant executive director. By contrast, Karin Driexler, executive director of the Fanwood-Scotch Plains Y, said her project required a $2.4 million grant from an economic development council and a capital campaign that raised $1 million.</p>
        <p>At the Morris Center Y.M.C.A. at Cedar Knolls, $4 million raised through individual and corporate donors was used primarily to acquire a neighboring building and to place an expanded child-care center in it, enlarging the overall facility to 57,000 square feet, from 37,000.</p>
        <p>The 12,000-member Madison Y raised $5 million through fund-raisers and grants for a 2001 project that enlarged the fitness and family center to 14,000 square feet, from 9,000, while the West Orange branch of the J.C.C. Metrowest raised $14 million through the Central New Jersey Jewish Federation for an overhaul that started only recently.</p>
        <p>The renovation project at the Morris Center Y happened because ''everything was outdated,'' said Michelle Breslin, its public relations coordinator. ''I don't think we were losing memberships,'' she said, ''but our base wasn't as strong.''</p>
        <p>The fund-raising difference between Y's and J.C.C.'s may be demographic as well as cultural.</p>
        <p>''Historically, the Jewish community in New Jersey has very strong philanthropic support,'' said Eric Robbins, associate executive director of the Metrowest J.C.C.</p>
        <p>Metrowest, which moved to West Orange 40 years ago and built a branch center in Whippany eight years ago, has roots in Newark, he added.</p>
        <p>''And Newark has one of the strongest Jewish communities in the state,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''That's continued in the culture. Probably, per capita, we raise a lot more money than other facilities. But that's in our history and our community's culture of giving.''</p>
        <p>However the money gets there, members like Elvy Saraceno and Gina Berez, both of West Orange, appreciate the way it is being spent.</p>
        <p>''I come three or four times a week for kickboxing, dancing -- to work out,'' Ms. Saraceno said while walking briskly on a treadmill at the West Orange J.C.C., part of a routine she has established in the two years since she joined. ''Everybody knows everybody, and you can always find something you want to do.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Berez, a three-year member, said she preferred the West Orange site to other gyms like New York Sports. ''There's not a show-off environment,'' she said. ''No one's looking at you here.''</p>
        <p>Neither Ms. Saraceno or Ms. Berez is Jewish. Exact breakdowns of religious affiliations were not available, but the directors of several J.C.C.'s said their memberships were about 20 percent non-Jewish. Some sites used to be exclusively Jewish, but non-Jewish memberships have picked up steadily through the years. The crowd of people working out at the J.C.C. in Whippany, for example, is typically a mix of cultures, including many Asians and a sprinkling of blacks.</p>
        <p>''There's no doubt that J.C.C.'s have changed,'' said Michael Hopkins, executive director of J.C.C. Metrowest, who has worked at various centers in various capacities since 1979, ''and that the trend now is in serving the entire community.''</p>
        <p>Still, the keep-to-yourself environment that Ms. Berez appreciates in the fitness center doesn't necessarily extend to religious expression.</p>
        <p>For all the talk of inclusiveness -- ''We'll take a member regardless of why,'' said Mr. Mann of the national association -- J.C.C.'s don't shrink from their mission to promote Jewish culture.</p>
        <p>Their purpose is ''to further the Jewish journey,'' as Mr. Mann put it. To that end, the Web sites of several J.C.C.'s note that non-Jewish food is not allowed on the premises.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the Y's Christian-based guiding philosophy -- the motto ''We build strong kids, strong families, strong communities'' is its answer to the J.C.C.'s ''Shalom, you're right where you belong'' -- may feel muted to its members. Its Christian principles are most visible in its community service commitments.</p>
        <p>As Ms. Roth of the YMCA-USA points out, most Y's efforts to impress their members in the gym come second to the more altruistic goal of sifting out needs within their towns.</p>
        <p>''We'll tailor specific programs,'' she said. ''In Newark and Paterson, the Y's are providing after-school literacy programs; they're doing job placement of teens.'' They also sometimes provide language classes for people who don't speak English.</p>
        <p>''There are very small Y's having an impact on their communities,'' she added. ''At the Salem County Y.M.C.A. in Carneys Point, they may not have the fastest computers or the best playgrounds, but it's keeping its doors open, and that's making a difference for people there. It's a safe place to go.''</p>
        <p>Y's make allowances through scholarships and private programs for people who would like to join but can't afford to. ''We'll work with anybody who is interested in becoming a member to help,'' Ms. Roth said; the message to on-hold callers at the YMCA-USA repeats the reassurance that ''no one is turned away because of inability to pay.''</p>
        <p>The principle at J.C.C.'s is similar but less guaranteed. ''If you can't afford to be a part of a program but would like to, we have various different ways of helping,'' said Mr. Lewinson of the Palisades, ''but we'll work out what a person can pay, whatever that amount is, because even if it's a dollar, we want to see that the person values the program.''</p>
        <p>Both organizations count on the United Way for contributions, in addition to private donors and corporations, and both make a specialty of resourcefulness. When Ms. Roth visited the Westfield Y in 2001 for staff training, for example, employees from the J.C.C. of Central New Jersey sat in. ''We're two organizations both working with committees and volunteers, so we figured, why not work together?'' she said.</p>
        <p>More significant, the Y and the J.C.C. in Edison are housed under the same roof on Oak Tree Road.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a merger,'' explained Dorothy Rubinstein, executive director of the J.C.C., ''but the J.C.C. had a large debt'' -- going back to 1985, when it opened -- ''and we were never able to solve it.'' Several years ago, she said, the chief executive of the Metuchen/Woodbridge Y called to suggest a joint program.</p>
        <p>''We were overcrowded in Metuchen,'' explained Cindi Archambault, executive director of the Edison branch of what is now called the Metuchen/Edison/Woodbridge YMCA, ''so we purchased some property from the J.C.C., an adjoining building.'' After hashing out the details over a five-year period, the J.C.C.-Y.M.C.A. combination opened its doors last December.</p>
        <p>''We remain two separate organizations,'' Ms. Rubinstein said. ''We're sectarian, and the Y.M.C.A. is nonsectarian, but now everybody shares the gym, the pool, the cardio equipment, the multipurpose room, and also community-wide events'' in the 23,000-square-foot building.</p>
        <p>''We're set up to be noncompetitive,'' she said, and the concept is working. ''Before we joined, we had under 1,000 families as members. We've had 6,000 new memberships in the past 10 months. We should be a model for J.C.C.'s and Y.M.C.A.'s everywhere.''</p>
