        <p>Since Rangers Coach Glen Sather publicly criticized right wing Anson Carter on Nov. 18, saying his play was uninspired, Carter has three goals and an assist in six games.</p>
        <p>Since Carter voiced his displeasure last Sunday at being scratched for the second straight game, ostensibly because of a sore right wrist, he has scored a goal in consecutive games heading into tonight's contest against the Tampa Bay Lightning at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Coincidence? Carter thinks so. Sather thinks not.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in a telephone interview, Sather said that Carter, who is making $2.8 million this season, is playing ''much better'' since he was criticized.</p>
        <p>''That's what coaches do,'' Sather said. ''It's not our job to be the player's best friend. You always want to encourage guys. But sometimes they need a little push.''</p>
        <p>On Thursday, when it was pointed out to Carter that Sather probably felt there was cause and effect between the criticism and his revived play, Carter said: ''That's just Slats being the coach. If I was the coach, I'd probably feel the same way.''</p>
