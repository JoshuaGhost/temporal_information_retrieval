        <p>If the Boston Red Sox's rivalry with the Yankees needed any more firepower, here it is: Alex Rodriguez could be on his way to Boston. The Red Sox have reportedly taken a major step toward acquiring Rodriguez, the American League most valuable player, by securing permission for the principal owner John Henry to speak with Rodriguez personally.</p>
        <p>According to published reports, Commissioner Bud Selig granted that permission, an obvious indicator of the serious nature of trade talks between the Red Sox and Rodriguez's team, the Texas Rangers.

        <p>If the Boston Red Sox's rivalry with the Yankees needed any more firepower, here it is: Alex Rodriguez could be on his way to Boston. The Red Sox have reportedly taken a major step toward acquiring Rodriguez, the American League most valuable player, by securing permission for the principal owner John Henry to speak with Rodriguez personally.</p>
        <p>According to published reports, Commissioner Bud Selig granted that permission, an obvious indicator of the serious nature of trade talks between the Red Sox and Rodriguez's team, the Texas Rangers. The Red Sox would ship outfielder Manny Ramirez to Texas and include a substantial amount of cash in the deal. Boston would then look to trade shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, probably to the Dodgers or Angels.</p>
        <p>The cash component has been a sticking point in trade talks between Boston and Texas. Rodriguez is the highest-paid player in baseball, at $25 million a season, and Ramirez's average annual salary, $20 million, is the second highest. Privately, Red Sox officials have reasoned that because a straight swap of the players would save Texas $86 million overall, the Red Sox should not have to subsidize the Rangers for any of Ramirez's contract.</p>
        <p>But Rodriguez, a marquee player trapped in baseball purgatory, badly wants to play in Boston, and the Red Sox recognize how much Rodriguez could help in their effort to dethrone the Yankees in a rivalry that has never been hotter. Rodriguez's communication with Henry could signal a willingness to defer money in his contract to lessen the immediate financial burden on the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>The Boston Herald first reported yesterday that Henry and Rodriguez had met, and a report in today's Boston Globe says that Henry will likely meet with Rodriguez and his agent, Scott Boras, after Henry's trip to the Dominican Republic to inaugurate the Red Sox's new baseball academy on Tuesday. The Globe also reported that Henry and Rodriguez have already held preliminary talks that may have lasted as long as six hours.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox could keep Garciaparra and Ramirez and bring back the heart of the majors' most potent offense. But Ramirez has so exasperated club officials that he was put on irrevocable waivers shortly after the season. Garciaparra is a fan favorite in Boston, but he will be a free agent next winter and the Red Sox have been reluctant to talk about a new deal.</p>
        <p>''He'd like to return to the Red Sox, but it takes two to make a deal,'' Garciaparra's agent, Arn Tellem, said yesterday. ''We told them we're ready, willing and able to do it, but the ball's in their court.''</p>
        <p>With the possibility of Garciaparra and Ramirez returning, however, the Red Sox have taken a cautious public stance. Yesterday, General Manager Theo Epstein issued a statement on behalf of the ownership group saying that the organization would not comment on trade rumors. ''Public speculation about player transactions, while a natural part of the hot stove season, can be offensive and hurtful to our players,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>Trading for Rodriguez and dealing away such stars as Garciaparra and Ramirez would be the boldest moves yet in a dizzying off-season for the Red Sox and the Yankees. On Nov. 26, the Red Sox traded four players to Arizona for Curt Schilling, who invited Epstein to his home for Thanksgiving dinner and agreed to the trade the next day, receiving a two-year, $25.5 million contract extension.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of which side of the fence I ended up on, it was going to be intense,'' Schilling said in a telephone interview this week, a few days after his introduction as the Red Sox's newest ace. ''It's something not a lot of guys get a chance to be a part of. There's a really decent chance that the two best teams in the game are going to be in the same division. You've got a World Series game 19 times a year.''</p>
        <p>Or more, at least last season, when the regular-season histrionics spilled into the American League Championship Series, where the Yankees outlasted the Red Sox in the 11th inning of the seventh game. The Yankees went on to lose the World Series to the Florida Marlins, ratcheting up the principal owner George Steinbrenner's scheming to spend with abandon to improve.</p>
        <p>In the Red Sox, though, Steinbrenner may have met his match. After the Schilling move, the Yankees -- who would not meet Arizona's demands for Alfonso Soriano and Nick Johnson -- were inevitably going to counter.</p>
        <p>''One of Newton's laws is that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction,'' Red Sox president Larry Lucchino, a frequent adversary of Steinbrenner's, said on Friday. ''Maybe we're seeing the baseball equivalent of Newton's law.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees could not equal Schilling in terms of finding a proven, veteran starter. But their reaction has been swift and gluttonous. They traded Johnson to the Montreal Expos for Javier Vazquez, a workhorse like Schilling who is 10 years younger. They have also reached unannounced free agent contracts with three former All-Stars: outfielder Gary Sheffield and relievers Tom Gordon and Paul Quantrill.</p>
        <p>Most teams have neither the money nor, in some cases, the motivation to play the high-stakes games of the Yankees and the Red Sox. But they are enjoying the show.</p>
        <p>''It's the last man standing,'' said San Diego Padres General Manager Kevin Towers. ''They're a couple of prize-fighters, just trying to one-up one another. We're all kind of sitting here eating popcorn and drinking sodas, watching it.''</p>
        <p>While anything is possible with Steinbrenner directing the Yankees' off-season plans, the Yankees may have slowed down a bit. They want to re-sign starter Andy Pettitte and seem to have focused on signing Kenny Lofton to play center field, shifting Bernie Williams to designated hitter.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox seemingly have several prominent moves to come. They are courting the free agent closer Keith Foulke, and their pursuit of Rodriguez appears to be charging ahead.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, of course, will keep a close eye on everything, with Steinbrenner looming over it all. As concerned as the Yankees may be about their rival, the Red Sox feel it is their responsibility to get better. ''We don't want to be outworked this off-season,'' Lucchino said. ''You still have to keep things in perspective. They are the defending American League champions, and we are the hungry underdogs.''</p>
