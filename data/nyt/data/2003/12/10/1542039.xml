        <p>New York University has moved a step closer to the eviction of the Bottom Line nightclub from an N.Y.U.-owned building after the nightclub's owners missed a Monday deadline to pay in full about $190,000 in back rent. A judge had given the club five days to pay, but the club responded with an offer of partial payment, about 20 percent of the sum over the next two weeks, said Josh Taylor, a university spokesman. Mr. Taylor said the club's rent has been in arrears for three years. In a statement, the Bottom Line's owners said that N.Y.U.'s lawyers had made it clear that the school ''was not interested in any way, shape or form in entertaining this proposal or any proposal, and in fact had no desire to have any communication with the Bottom Line at all.'' The statement did not indicate whether the owners would resist eviction.</p>
