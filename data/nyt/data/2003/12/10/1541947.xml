        <p>The owners of a Rhode Island nightclub and the tour manager of a heavy-metal band were indicted on Tuesday on charges of involuntary manslaughter in a fire at the nightclub that killed 100 people and injured nearly 200 last February.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey A. Derderian and Michael A. Derderian, brothers who owned the Station nightclub in West Warwick, and Daniel M. Biechele, the tour manager for the band, Great White, were each charged with 200 counts of involuntary manslaughter, two for each death. Each count carries a possible penalty of up to 30 years in prison.</p>
        <p>The indictments were the first criminal charges to emerge from a nine-month grand jury investigation into the Feb. 20 fire, which was the deadliest nightclub fire in 25 years and the fourth deadliest in the nation's history. The charges do not allege that the three intended to do any harm.</p>
        <p>The fire started after Mr. Biechele set off three pyrotechnical devices at the beginning of Great White's performance. The indoor fireworks emitted geysers of sparks, which instantly ignited polyurethane foam that the club's owners had installed on the walls and ceiling to muffle the sound of the loud music.</p>
        <p>Within minutes, the wood-framed building was engulfed in flames, and club patrons were smashing windows and stampeding toward doors to try to escape. Nearly a quarter of the more than 400 people in the club died, most from being trapped inside and inhaling the thick noxious smoke from the burning foam.</p>
        <p>''We don't have the ability to bring closure to the poor people who are suffering so,'' said Patrick C. Lynch, Rhode Island's attorney general. But Mr. Lynch said he hoped that with the indictments, ''we can offer some solace.''</p>
        <p>At an arraignment on Tuesday afternoon before Judge Netti C. Vogel of Kent County Superior Court, the three men stood somberly and pleaded not guilty. Mr. Biechele, 27, of Winter Springs, Fla., was released on $100,000 bail; Jeffrey Derderian, 37, of Cranston, R.I., and Michael Derderian, 42, of Narragansett, R.I., were each released on $50,000 bail.</p>
        <p>The manslaughter charges against each man, all felonies, were divided into 100 counts alleging criminal negligence and 100 counts alleging that a misdemeanor the defendant committed led to the fire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch said that the Derderians were charged with criminal negligence for ''the manner in which they operated their club'' since they bought it in 2000, and that they were charged with ''misdemeanor manslaughter'' because ''they had an obligation to maintain the building, in particular the soundproofing material, in ways that it was fire resistant.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Biechele was charged with criminal negligence ''for the manner in which he discharged pyrotechnic devices,'' Mr. Lynch said. He did not disclose the reasons for the misdemeanor manslaughter charges against Mr. Biechele, which were contained in a detailed indictment that was not released on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the three men said their clients had expressed sympathy and sorrow for the victims.</p>
        <p>Reacting to the charges, a lawyer for Mr. Biechele suggested that the club owners were at fault, while a lawyer for the Derderians placed responsibility on Mr. Biechele and the band.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biechele's lawyer, Thomas G. Briody, said: ''Dan Biechele is not guilty of the charges brought in this case. He could not have known of the dangerous conditions that existed inside the Station.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Biechele, who has maintained that Michael Derderian gave him permission to use the fireworks, ''relied on the word of people who told him that Great White could perform, and perform with the use of pyrotechnic devices.''</p>
        <p>The Derderians have said that they did not give permission for the pyrotechnics, and that they did not know they would be used that night.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Jeffrey Derderian, Jeffrey B. Pine, said the Derderians ''are not criminals, they did not commit any criminal acts, they should not be charged with any crime.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pine said he believed the band's leader, Jack Russell, who knew the fireworks would be used, should have been indicted, adding that ''the person or persons who lit the pyro are the persons directly responsible for this tragedy.''</p>
        <p>At the time of the arraignment, victims' relatives were being told of the indictments in a meeting with Mr. Lynch at a banquet hall in West Warwick, a working-class community whose tragedy reverberated all over this small state. Many relatives were frustrated that more people had not been charged, particularly the fire inspector and building inspector for West Warwick, who, in four inspections over three years, never mentioned the foam.</p>
        <p>Charles Sweet, 68, of Pembroke Mass., whose son, Shawn Patrick Sweet, 28, died in the fire, said he did not understand why the inspectors were not indicted. ''To walk into that building and see that cheap foam sticking out of the walls and to turn your head,'' Mr. Sweet said.</p>
        <p>Neither Dennis Larocque, the West Warwick fire marshal, nor Stephen Murray, the town building inspector, returned calls seeking comment on Tuesday. A lawyer for Mr. Russell, Ed McPherson, said his client was feeling ''certainly relieved, but it's not the kind of thing you're giving high fives about.''</p>
        <p>A band that reached the height of its popularity in the 1980's, Great White, which lost its guitarist, Ty Longley, in the fire, has continued to perform, donating ticket proceeds to a group helping the fire victims.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch declined to address why others were not indicted.</p>
        <p>Legal experts said it would have been harder for prosecutors to make the case that the actions of any of the others rose to the level of a crime.</p>
        <p>''It's easier to target the guy who set off the pyro,'' said Andrew Horwitz, associate professor of law at Roger Williams University law school in Bristol, R.I. ''It's easier to target the club owners and claim a whole host of issues that look like the causal picture are their responsibility. It's harder to make that claim against people in the band or against people who are more tangentially linked to the causes.''</p>
        <p>The investigation and grand jury inquiry considered reams of evidence, including town inspection records; datebooks and computers from the band members and club owners; records regarding the installation of the foam; and pieces of wiring, foam and other evidence from the demolished nightclub.</p>
        <p>One key piece of evidence was a videotape of the fire taken by a photographer for WPRI in Providence, which was preparing a report about nightclub safety. The reporter working on it was Jeffrey Derderian, who was well known in Rhode Island, and who had started working for WPRI just three days before the fire.</p>
        <p>Several months after buying the Station, the Derderians, facing pressure from neighbors and town officials to control the sound of their performers, bought the foam from a foam salesman who lived behind the club. Town records have no indication of the foam's being tested for flammability and no registration of the manufacturer's information with the town government, as required by Rhode Island's fire code.</p>
        <p>More than 100 people have hired lawyers to prepare civil suits against the Derderians, town officials, the state, band members and others. Lawyers have suspended litigation until a judge decides whether the cases should be heard in state or federal court. The fire also prompted Rhode Island and other states to adopt stricter fire regulations for nightclubs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lynch said on Tuesday that many relatives were upset that Rhode Island did not have a law that allows criminal charges for involuntary actions that lead to injuries. He said he would press for such a law.</p>
