        <p>GERSHENSON -- Milton G. The Brooklyn Law School Community notes with sorrow the loss of a distinguished graduate, esteemed teacher and beloved colleague. In more than a halfcentury of service on the Law School Faculty, he touched the lives of thousands of students. In addition to teaching, he served as a Special Hearing Officer for the United States Department of Justice, as Advisor to the New York Joint Legislative Committee on Family Law, and as Chief Reporter for the Criminal Jury Instructions Project of the State of New York. Although his presence will be missed, he legacy will be long enduring. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Paula and daughter Suzette. Stuart Subotnick, Chairman of Board of Trustees Joan G. Wexler, Dean</p>
