        <p>Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said today that while Iraq should be disarmed, the presence of American forces in the Persian Gulf was worse than Iraq's access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the University of Tehran for the Friday Prayer sermon, an official national pulpit, Mr. Rafsanjani said: ''We agree that Iraq should rid itself of weapons of mass destruction. We do not think the Baath regime of Iraq should possess weapons like long-range missiles.''</p>

        <p>Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said today that while Iraq should be disarmed, the presence of American forces in the Persian Gulf was worse than Iraq's access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
        <p>Speaking at the University of Tehran for the Friday Prayer sermon, an official national pulpit, Mr. Rafsanjani said: ''We agree that Iraq should rid itself of weapons of mass destruction. We do not think the Baath regime of Iraq should possess weapons like long-range missiles.''</p>
        <p>But he added, ''We consider the presence of the U.S. in the region worse than Saddam possessing these weapons.''</p>
        <p>The crowd responded with chants of ''Death to America!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rafsanjani sought to portray the United States as a dangerous warmonger that threatens to use nuclear weapons to pursue its interests, and he hinted that Iran might be singled out after Iraq.</p>
        <p>''A country that threatens to use nuclear bombs is not seeking the disarmament of Iraq,'' he said. ''Even if it conquers Iraq and installs a ruler, it will use the same weapons against neighboring countries that Saddam did.''</p>
        <p>In an apparent reference to the American use of force against Iraq, he said, ''We hope this act of madness will not take place and the region will not be put on fire.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rafsanjani, a midlevel cleric, has always been a strong force in Iran's Islamic Republic. He is the head of the Expediency Council, a powerful oversight body that settles constitutional disputes and advises Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader. Before that, Mr. Rafsanjani served for eight years as speaker of Iran's Parliament and then eight years as president.</p>
        <p>But he was humiliated in the 2001 parliamentary elections, just grabbing the 30th of 30 seats for the city of Tehran, finishing behind 29 reformist candidates. He relinquished his seat shortly before Parliament convened.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Rafsanjani seems to be consolidating power once again and is much more visible on the political scene. He shares in many of the ceremonial functions of both President Mohammad Khatami and Ayatollah Khamenei. Earlier this week, for example, Chris Patten, the European Union's foreign affairs commissioner, met with Mr. Rafsanjani during a three-day tour of Iran, much to the consternation of reformists who view him with suspicion, even loathing.</p>
        <p>Both conservative and reformist Iranian leaders have said that Iran opposes a unilateral American military attack against Iraq, but that it would not oppose decisions of the Security Council.</p>
        <p>In Bratislava, Slovakia, today, Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, told reporters that Iran was ''not going to support either side in such a battle. We believe that there is still room for diplomatic effort.''</p>
        <p>He added that there was suspicion in the Middle East that the United States had a ''hidden agenda'' in attacking Iraq and wanted to ''reshape the whole Middle East area based on their own interests.''</p>
        <p>Iranian officials seem to be building a case against unilateral military action in part because they want to avoid the unintended consequences that could come with war. In calling on the United Nations to take the lead in disarming Iraq, Mr. Rafsanjani warned today that if the disarmament were not carried out properly, ''there could be a backlash.''</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Iran's top naval officer warned that the United States would pay a heavy price if it attacked Iran. ''If the United States attacks Islamic Iran, it will suffer heavy losses,'' Rear Adm. Abbas Mohtaj was quoted as saying in The Kayhan, a conservative newspaper. He added, ''We know its weak points.''</p>
