        <p>The White House moved quickly today to shore up support for President Bush's economic plan and took the rare step of bluntly disagreeing with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, over the need for an immediate new round of tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Faced with signs that his proposed $670 billion tax cut will have difficulty in the Senate, Mr. Bush went on the offensive, giving a speech promoting the plan, releasing a letter from 250 economists backing his approach and seeking to head off any damage from Mr. Greenspan's statement on Tuesday that it is premature for Congress to pass an economic stimulus plan.</p>

        <p>The White House moved quickly today to shore up support for President Bush's economic plan and took the rare step of bluntly disagreeing with Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, over the need for an immediate new round of tax cuts.</p>
        <p>Faced with signs that his proposed $670 billion tax cut will have difficulty in the Senate, Mr. Bush went on the offensive, giving a speech promoting the plan, releasing a letter from 250 economists backing his approach and seeking to head off any damage from Mr. Greenspan's statement on Tuesday that it is premature for Congress to pass an economic stimulus plan.</p>
        <p>''It's a well-thought-out plan,'' Mr. Bush told an audience of about 100 in a speech to a trade association in Alexandria, Va.</p>
        <p>Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said there was a reasonable disagreement between Mr. Greenspan's view that the economy was likely to recover on its own once the uncertainty about war with Iraq is past and the president's view that the economy needed the impetus that he says his tax cuts would provide.</p>
        <p>''The president will err on the side of helping those who look for work,'' Mr. Fleischer said. ''Therefore he supports a stimulus.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Fleischer emphasized that Mr. Greenspan had endorsed the centerpiece of Mr. Bush's tax plan, its call for eliminating the tax on most stock dividends.</p>
        <p>He objected to newspaper accounts of Mr. Greenspan's testimony as harmful to Mr. Bush's agenda. And he played down the Fed chairman's statement that the dividend tax cut should be adopted only as part of a package that would not worsen the budget deficit, a very different approach from that taken by the president, whose dividend tax cut proposal would increase the deficit by $385 billion over the next decade.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Mr. Fleischer suggested, the president will still get the tax legislation he wants from the House and the Senate.</p>
        <p>''You're watching the beginning of a process in the Congress,'' he told reporters, ''and I look forward to continue talking to you about it as the signing ceremony takes place.''</p>
        <p>In a second consecutive day of testimony on Capitol Hill, Mr. Greenspan, a Republican who was first appointed to his post by President Ronald Reagan in 1987, seemed to want to mend fences with Mr. Bush and his party.</p>
        <p>Speaking to the House Financial Services Committee today, Mr. Greenspan did not retract any of the statements he made to the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday -- that there is no need for a short-term stimulus, that deficits are a problem and that Congress should offset new tax cuts with either spending cuts or other tax increases.</p>
        <p>But where Mr. Greenspan inveighed about the dangers of deficits on Tuesday, he played down those concerns today and asserted that the worst of the budget problems would only arise once the current generation of baby boomers began to retire in 2010.</p>
        <p>''Actually, it turns out that we do not really have a fiscal problem of moment until we get beyond the end of this decade,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan said the $300 billion deficits projected by the White House for this year and next were ''modest'' in relation to the size of the economy, and that the country's longer-range budget problems, caused by a projected surge in Social Security and Medicare spending, would occur ''with or without the president's program.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan was warmer today than on Tuesday about the president's dividend tax proposal. He said that eliminating taxes on most stock dividends would ''almost surely increase the aggregate of economic activity'' over the long term and might provide a small immediate boost as well.</p>
        <p>''I strongly support it,'' he told the committee.</p>
        <p>But under persistent questioning from Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, Mr. Greenspan reiterated his view that Congress should approve new tax cuts only after it reinstates recently expired budget rules that would require offsetting tax increases or spending reductions.</p>
        <p>In his speech and in a round-table discussion with a group of investors beforehand at a Charles Schwab &amp; Company brokerage office in Alexandria, Va., Mr. Bush emphasized defending his dividend tax cut.</p>
        <p>Dismissing criticism from Democrats that eliminating the tax would primarily benefit the wealthy, Mr. Bush cast the proposal as one that would help an emerging class of small investors, from young people who are saving for their children's educations to retirees who rely on dividends for income.</p>
        <p>''Getting rid of the double taxation of dividends is good economic policy for the short term for America, it is good economic policy for the long term of America, and I urge the Congress to eliminate the double taxation of dividends,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, like President Bill Clinton, has always handled Mr. Greenspan gingerly, given the immense influence the Fed chairman has not only over the economy but also over policy proposals on Capitol Hill. Mr. Greenspan gave Mr. Bush's original tax cut in 2001 crucial support in Congress. But he was also blamed by some Republicans -- including, by some accounts, the current president's father -- for their loss of the White House in 1992, when the economy was slow to emerge from the recession of the previous year.</p>
        <p>Still, the current administration appears willing to engage Mr. Greenspan in a debate. R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, attempted to rebut Mr. Greenspan's assertion that there was unlikely to be any immediate need for steps by Congress to stimulate the economy.</p>
        <p>''Downside risks are more of a key item than his testimony seems to suggest,'' Mr. Hubbard told a gathering at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''The president is very worried about downside risks to the economy.''</p>
        <p>But Democrats said Mr. Greenspan had refocused the debate on the implications of Mr. Bush's proposal for the budget deficit in the long run, a shift that they said would help them alter the plan to make it smaller, temporary and focused more on lower and moderate income people who needed the help most.</p>
        <p>''We need to have a debate about it,'' said Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey. ''Greenspan has made that debate possible.''</p>
