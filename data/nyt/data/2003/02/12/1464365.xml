        <p>The ball slices some 40 yards from midfield over a baffled defense on a balmy Sunday morning; the waiting striker flips it into the goal, leaving the goalkeeper stunned.</p>
        <p>It is the kind of pass that takes years for an athlete to see, much less master. It is a special move, and it comes from a special player. A 13-year-old player, to be precise.</p>
        <p>Freddy Adu is an unusual find. He is expected to be eligible to suit up and start for the United States team when it goes into regional qualifying in March in Guatemala for the under-17 world championships, which will be played in August in Finland. A soon-to-be naturalized Ghanaian, the 5-foot-8, 150-pound Adu plays years beyond his age, demonstrating a maturity that has pro scouts salivating and coaches trying to shield him from a hungry soccer world eager to jump on board the next big thing. He has already reportedly turned down a $100,000 offer from the Italian power Inter Milan.</p>
        <p>If, as expected, his mother, Emilia, gets her citizenship on Thursday, Adu can apply for his passport on Friday, which would make him a sweet Valentine's Day gift to soccer in the United States. If all goes according to plan, when Adu takes the field in Guatemala City on March 5 against Jamaica, he will be the youngest player to wear a national team jersey for the United States.</p>
        <p>''Adu is a special player; he is the real thing,'' Bruce Arena, coach of the senior national team, said.</p>
        <p>John Ellinger, the coach of the under-17 team, says Adu ''is one of a kind, an elite player.''</p>
        <p>Peter Mellor, a former professional player in England with Sunderland who now serves as Ellinger's assistant, said, ''See him against the full team and watch him go past some senior internationals and you say to yourself, 'He's not a handful; he's two handfuls.' ''</p>
        <p>And what does Adu say?</p>
        <p>''I came to the U.S.A. for school,'' he said. ''I had no clue this would happen.''</p>
        <p>Such precociousness is not unprecedented, of course. Tennis stars are frequently in their midteens, and ice skaters and gymnasts can emerge at an even younger age. In soccer, it is not hard to find 10-year-olds involved with major clubs, especially in Latin America, where soccer is a way out of poverty. But in the United States, young, highly talented players are still considered remarkable, even though Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley both made the leap from the under-17 team to the 2002 World Cup. There is no minimum age to play on a senior national team.</p>
        <p>Adu could prove to be as good as either of those players. He has an instinctive vision for the game; watching him from the sideline, you get the impression of a young man coiled, waiting for the right moment to burst out. Like a seasoned pro, Adu creates space around himself, seeming to move his opponents away from him so that he can get the ball. One flick later, that ball is gone, toward the goal.</p>
        <p>''Watch him switch gears,'' Ellinger said admiringly. ''He mixes styles so well. He just makes this team much better.''</p>
        <p>Adu, who moved to the United States when he was 8 and is living with other under-17 players in Bradenton, Fla., comes across as more poised than his age (he will turn 14 on June 2, according to his birth certificate, which has been seen by United States Soccer Federation officials). Adu is concise, mature and funny.</p>
        <p>''When I first came over, I played in a tournament in Washington,'' he said. ''I guess I played well enough because all of a sudden I was told I could go somewhere with this.''</p>
        <p>Nothing seems to faze him. Does he mind playing with people who are older than he? ''Nope,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Does he mind people with microphones and cameras showing up at practice fields, eager to catch a glimpse? ''I don't care about that stuff at all,'' he said. ''I just want to have fun.''</p>
