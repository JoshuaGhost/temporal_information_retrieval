        <p>Federal health officials today urged greater use of a rapid H.I.V. test to identify newly infected people as early as possible and so reduce their chances of transmitting the virus to others.</p>
        <p>The test, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in November, can provide results in 20 minutes rather than the few days it takes to get results of the standard H.I.V. test. In many cases, patients who have taken the standard test have failed to return to learn the results, hampering efforts to control the epidemic.</p>
        <p>If positive, the results of the new test, in which a drop of blood is simply taken from a patient's finger, must still be confirmed by more specific laboratory methods.</p>
        <p>But speaking here at the 10th Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections, Dr. Ronald O. Valdiserri, an AIDS official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recommended that the new test be part of routine health care for those at risk of infection.</p>
        <p>The conference was also the setting for a report on new information from a study, undertaken in Africa, that underscored the much higher risk of H.I.V. transmission in the first months after infection compared with later stages of the disease. The rate of transmission also rises sharply in the months before death from AIDS, according to the study, by Dr. Maria J. Wawer and her colleagues at Johns Hopkins University and in Uganda.</p>
        <p>In the study, the rate of transmitting H.I.V. was 8.2 per thousand sexual acts in the first five months after a person became infected, and 1.5 per thousand sexual acts in the next year or two, Dr. Wawer said. The risk then rose sharply, to 4.5 per thousand sexual acts, in the 15 months before death from AIDS. The findings are consistent with what was already understood to be a kind of AIDS cycle: a rise, a dip and then another rise in the amount of H.I.V. in the blood as the infection progresses.</p>
        <p>At a news conference, Dr. Harold W. Jaffe, who directs the AIDS program at the disease control centers, said, ''It is a really important study, in that it confirms what we believe based on much less direct evidence.''</p>
        <p>Because the findings were part of a larger study, however, and because that study was conducted in Africa, where the pattern of infection is different from that in this country, participants at the meeting cautioned against extrapolating precise risks to the United States.</p>
        <p>Other new data reported at the meeting added to earlier findings suggesting that H.I.V. infections might be on the rise. In part, the concerns reflect outbreaks of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases that can correlate with a risk of acquiring H.I.V. Such outbreaks have been reported in a number of cities.</p>
        <p>A survey of nearly 3,000 affluent gay men who often recruited partners through the Internet found that many commonly had unprotected anal sex despite their high level of education, said Dr. Sabina Hirshfield of the Medical and Health Research Association of New York City.</p>
        <p>Most participants in the survey said they had had from 1 to 50 sexual partners in their lifetimes, but 7.5 percent said they had had from 501 to more than 1,000.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hirshfield, and colleagues from the New York Blood Center, the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Columbia University, found that H.I.V-infected men and those who used drugs and alcohol were most likely to participate in unprotected anal sex.</p>
        <p>In other research, a team from the University of North Carolina that was led by Dr. David A. Wohl studied 80 infected inmates, men and women alike, in North Carolina prisons. Many of them engaged in high-risk sex and drug activity within days or even hours after their release, and 31 percent said it was ''very or somewhat likely'' that they would infect their H.I.V.-negative partner.</p>
        <p>That as many as 20 percent of H.I.V.-infected people a year in this country spend time in a correctional facility underscores an urgent need for researchers to find ways to reduce the risk of H.I.V. transmission by departing inmates, Dr. Wohl said.</p>
        <p>An estimated 800,000 to 900,000 Americans are living with H.I.V. But about 280,000 do not know that they are infected, and the finger-stick test whose wider use was urged here today is intended to identify many of them.</p>
        <p>The finger-stick test is an important tool in the government's stepped-up program to reduce by half the annual number of new infections by 2005.</p>
        <p>Health officials have repeatedly expressed concern that the number of Americans newly infected has remained at some 40,000 a year over the last decade. That number is substantially lower than the 150,000 in the early days of the epidemic, but it is far too high, the officials say.</p>
        <p>All states report newly diagnosed AIDS cases, but not all report newly diagnosed H.I.V. infections. That makes it difficult for health officials to track the progress of the epidemic precisely.</p>
        <p>One worrisome fact is that for the first time in several years, the number of newly diagnosed AIDS cases increased slightly in 2001, up 1 percent, said Dr. Valdiserri, of the disease control centers.</p>
        <p>''It is too early to know if this represents a reversal of previous AIDS trends,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But that finding is among the reasons Dr. Valdiserri's agency has been working with specialized groups to change the way people are counseled and tested for H.I.V.</p>
        <p>The disease control centers recognized the many barriers, like lack of reimbursement, that discourage doctors from spending the hour or so needed to counsel patients, Dr. Valdiserri said. He also said that ''risk reduction counseling should not be seen as the sole responsibility of the physician.'' Doctors, he said, can refer patients to other health care workers who can deliver sound prevention messages.</p>
