      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in Business Day on Monday about Sabre Holdings, the online travel reservation system, misstated its revenue forecast for this year. The prediction is for growth of 4 to 9 percent, not decline of a few percentage points. The article also misstated Sabre's reason for selling part of its computer operations to Electronic Data Services. The goal was to exit unattractive lines of business, not to respond to a slowdown in business travel.</p>
