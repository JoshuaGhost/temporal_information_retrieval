        <p>A United Nations team examining human rights abuses in Iran said today that it had found violations but noted that Iranian authorities had shown extensive cooperation in the inquiry.</p>
        <p>Since arriving on Feb. 16, the five-member United Nations team, led by Louis Joinet from France, has met with judiciary authorities and members of Parliament, has inspected prisons and detention centers in Tehran and other cities, and has spoken to prisoners and their family members.</p>

        <p>A United Nations team examining human rights abuses in Iran said today that it had found violations but noted that Iranian authorities had shown extensive cooperation in the inquiry.</p>
        <p>Since arriving on Feb. 16, the five-member United Nations team, led by Louis Joinet from France, has met with judiciary authorities and members of Parliament, has inspected prisons and detention centers in Tehran and other cities, and has spoken to prisoners and their family members.</p>
        <p>The investigation was the first time in seven years that United Nations rights observers had been allowed into the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Joinet said today in a news conference that most cases of prisoners he interviewed fell under the category of arbitrary detention. Dozens of advocates and journalists who have pushed for more political and social openness have been jailed by the country's hard-line judiciary since 1997.</p>
        <p>Avoiding giving details of individual cases, Mr. Joinet said the team had found ''detention in solitary confinement practiced on a wide scale and for long periods of time'' in parts of Evin prison in Tehran. He also referred to ''sentences that were quite disproportionate to the crimes'' and an absence of legal culture, in that many criminals were not aware of the importance of having lawyers.</p>
        <p>He also mentioned the arrest of lawyers of political prisoners, who were jailed ''simply because they reported torture against their clients.''</p>
        <p>Despite his criticisms, Mr. Joinet praised the ''unprecedented cooperation'' the team had received from the authorities. He said the team had chosen the prisons and detention centers it inspected and the more than 100 prisoners it interviewed. The team picked the locations for interviews inside prisons without the presence of minders and ''frequently changed position to make sure they were away from cameras,'' Mr. Joinet said.</p>
        <p>The team was even allowed to visit the notorious Block 209 in the Evin prison, which Mr. Joinet described as a prison within a prison that was controlled by the Ministry of Information.</p>
        <p>The observers were also permitted to enter a military prison in the city of Shiraz after they made a last-minute decision to inspect the place.</p>
        <p>Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi of Iran said he welcomed the presence of the team and appreciated the United Nations' new approach toward Iran rather than issuing ''useless condemnation resolutions.''</p>
        <p>''For years, European countries tested the method of issuing resolutions but learned it was useless.'' he said last week. ''Now they are seeking dialogue with Iran.''</p>
        <p>The police broke up two rallies today by families of political prisoners outside the Laleh Hotel, where Mr. Joinet and his team were staying in Tehran. About 20 demonstrators were arrested on Saturday and Tuesday, the police said. Mr. Joinet said judiciary authorities had assured the team that all were released.</p>
        <p>He noted that he had received a big pile of letters and reports from protesters, all of which were in Persian, and needed to be translated before he could make any statement about them.</p>
        <p>The Iran researcher for Human Rights Watch, Elaheh Sharifpour, who is based in New York, voiced concern that the team did not meet with people who had been arbitrarily arrested in the past and were out of prison now or inspect underground detention centers.</p>
