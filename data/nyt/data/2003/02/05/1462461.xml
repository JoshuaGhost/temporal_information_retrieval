        <p>Editorial urges Bush administration to drop its preconditions for direct talks with North Korea because its rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program is most urgent threat facing America; says Pentagon's decision to put 24 long-range bombers on alert for possible transfer to bases closer to Asia may do more harm than good (M)</p>

        <p>North Korea's rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program is the most urgent threat facing America today. Yet the administration, intent on dealing with Iraq first, has been reluctant to give diplomacy with North Korea the priority it warrants. Yesterday's reaffirmation by Washington that it recognizes the need for direct talks with North Korea is fine, but not good enough. Those talks will probably never take place unless the administration drops its preconditions.</p>
        <p>The North has said it will talk about ending its nuclear ambitions as part of a broader discussion encompassing guarantees of its security and desperately needed economic help. Washington is willing to discuss those issues later, but for now only wants to hear how North Korea intends to end its nuclear projects. Pyongyang also prefers to deal with Washington alone, while the Bush administration wants other countries involved. By the time the two sides agree on the ground rules, North Korea could already have multiplied by three or fourfold the two nuclear weapons it is now suspected of having. If the administration wants to deal from its own maximum strength, it should talk now.</p>

        <p>North Korea's rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program is the most urgent threat facing America today. Yet the administration, intent on dealing with Iraq first, has been reluctant to give diplomacy with North Korea the priority it warrants. Yesterday's reaffirmation by Washington that it recognizes the need for direct talks with North Korea is fine, but not good enough. Those talks will probably never take place unless the administration drops its preconditions.</p>
        <p>The North has said it will talk about ending its nuclear ambitions as part of a broader discussion encompassing guarantees of its security and desperately needed economic help. Washington is willing to discuss those issues later, but for now only wants to hear how North Korea intends to end its nuclear projects. Pyongyang also prefers to deal with Washington alone, while the Bush administration wants other countries involved. By the time the two sides agree on the ground rules, North Korea could already have multiplied by three or fourfold the two nuclear weapons it is now suspected of having. If the administration wants to deal from its own maximum strength, it should talk now.</p>
        <p>While the White House frets about the appearance of rewarding North Korean misconduct with unconditional talks and worries about temporarily shifting the spotlight off Saddam Hussein, North Korea seems to be getting ready to build bombs on a very fast timetable. It could have an additional five or six by July. Punishing past duplicity and focusing on one crisis at a time are sound diplomatic precepts. But this crisis is far too pressing for such niceties to stand in the way of the best remaining chance for a peaceful solution.</p>
        <p>Negotiating with Pyongyang is a predictably frustrating experience. But passing up the chance for diplomacy would risk two far more unpleasant options. Washington would either have to accept a North Korea with plenty of nuclear bombs to brandish and leftover plutonium to sell to the highest bidder, or face the possibility of a new Korean War.</p>
        <p>In the absence of active diplomacy, the Pentagon's decision to put 24 long-range bombers on alert for possible transfer to bases closer to Asia may do more harm than good. The intended message is twofold. Washington wants to signal North Korea that even as the United States mobilizes forces for imminent war with Iraq, it is still able to act in Northeast Asia.</p>
        <p>The other message is more menacing. While the administration has assured North Korea it has no intention of invading, it has left open the possibility of a pre-emptive air attack on North Korean nuclear plants. Alerting the long-range bombers sharpens that warning. Unfortunately, it does so in a way that could heighten tensions in an already alarmed region.</p>
        <p>Unconditional negotiations with Pyongyang do not oblige Washington to hand out any rewards to North Korea before that country agrees to a verifiable plan for permanently ending its nuclear weapons ambitions. Negotiating the precise linkage and sequence of these elements is exactly what the two countries need to talk about. They should start doing so now.</p>
