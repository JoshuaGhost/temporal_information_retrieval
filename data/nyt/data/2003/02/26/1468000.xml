        <p>In her summation at the Peter Gotti racketeering trial yesterday, a prosecutor said she had a surprise for the defense.</p>

        <p>In her summation at the Peter Gotti racketeering trial yesterday, a prosecutor said she had a surprise for the defense.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to ask you,'' she told the jurors in federal court in Brooklyn, ''to ignore the fact that Peter Gotti's last name is Gotti. I'm going to ask you to ignore the fact that his younger brother was John Gotti.''</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Katya Jestin, was clearly trying to blunt the defense argument that the case against Mr. Gotti and six other men was merely a prosecution effort to relive the government's biggest Mafia victory in a generation, the 1992 conviction of John J. Gotti, the former Gambino boss who died in prison last year. The prosecutors contend that Peter Gotti, a retired sanitation worker, now runs the crime family. ''The evidence,'' Ms. Jestin said, ''has nothing to do with his last name.''</p>
        <p>Instead, she said, the jurors should focus on the evidence introduced in the last six weeks, including surveillance photographs of Peter Gotti, 63, meeting in Queens with a suspected Mafia soldier, who the prosecutors say brought Mr. Gotti regular tribute payments from a Gambino crew. Ms. Jestin acknowledged the biggest vulnerability in the government's case when she noted that no prosecution witness had directly said that Mr. Gotti had become the Gambino boss. But that conclusion, she said, was confirmed in bitter words of sibling rivalry captured on a hidden microphone in the visiting room of a Pennsylvania federal prison. Mr. Gotti's brother Gene is serving a 50-year term there for heroin trafficking. Gene Gotti, she said, ''thought he would be a better boss'' than Peter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jestin spent much of her summation, which lasted all day and is to continue today, focusing on four of the other defendants: Anthony Ciccone, who the prosecutors say is a Gambino captain, and three men who thet say are part of his crew, Jerome Brancato, Primo Cassarino and Richard Bondi.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jestin said Mr. Ciccone had been the Gambino family captain in control of the New York waterfront for 20 years and she cataloged a series of the crimes he is accused of that include corrupt control of the longshoremen's union, extortion and illegal gambling. She described Mr. Cassarino and Mr. Bondi as Mr. Ciccone's henchmen who would intimidate uncooperative extortion victims. Mr. Brancato, 74, she said, was a trusted messenger.</p>
        <p>She reminded the jurors of a wiretap placed on one of Mr. Ciccone's favorite telephones, in a Staten Island barbershop called Guys 'n Dolls. She mentioned a recording in which Mr. Ciccone told a man who was overdue on his payment that money had to be paid before that Tuesday. ''Tuesday is too late, Vinnie,'' Mr. Ciccone said. ''They gotta do what they gotta do on Wednesday.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jestin said what had to be done on Wednesday was the delivery of the tribute payment from Mr. Ciccone's crew to Mr. Gotti.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jestin reminded the jurors of videotapes showing regular meetings on the streets of Howard Beach, Queens, between Mr. Gotti and Mr. Brancato, who she said was ''the old-timer, trusted to deliver the proceeds of Sonny Ciccone's crew to the acting boss of the Gambino crime family, Peter Gotti.''</p>
