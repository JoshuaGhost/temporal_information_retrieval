        <p>I ONCE spent almost a month exploring a single neighborhood in Paris, the Sixth Arrondissement. I can imagine visits to Napoleon's Paris or medieval Paris or Hemingway's Paris, and visits concentrating on cafes or flea markets. Gastronomic blowouts, too, of course, and couture shopping sprees, and museum marathons.</p>
        <p>Last fall, my wife, Betsey, and I devoted the better part of a week to the city's architecture -- not the kind of grand (sometimes grandiose) architecture that typifies the city, like Notre-Dame and the Arc de Triomphe, but modern architecture, the architecture of the last century or so.</p>

        <p>I ONCE spent almost a month exploring a single neighborhood in Paris, the Sixth Arrondissement. I can imagine visits to Napoleon's Paris or medieval Paris or Hemingway's Paris, and visits concentrating on cafes or flea markets. Gastronomic blowouts, too, of course, and couture shopping sprees, and museum marathons.</p>
        <p>Last fall, my wife, Betsey, and I devoted the better part of a week to the city's architecture -- not the kind of grand (sometimes grandiose) architecture that typifies the city, like Notre-Dame and the Arc de Triomphe, but modern architecture, the architecture of the last century or so.</p>
        <p>Beginning with the construction of the Eiffel Tower for the Universal Exposition in 1889 and continuing down to our own time with the Cité de la Musique, Christian de Portzamparc's thrillingly imaginative project on the site of the old Villette stockyards, innovative buildings that influenced designers around the world have gone up in Paris and its suburbs. Many are still standing.</p>
        <p>Some were built in the face of old-guard disapproval. Maupassant, Gounod and Charles Garnier, the architect of the Opéra, all denounced the Eiffel Tower. Some, like the ''grands projets'' of François Mitterrand, were built with state funds. There are flops aplenty. My own indictment would include the clumsy arch at La Défense, in the northwestern suburbs, meant to provide a punctuation mark out beyond the end of the Champs-Élysées; the banal, inescapable Tour Montparnasse and the glitzy, graceless new Bastille opera house. And no Francophile of my generation will ever forget or forgive the destruction of the steel-and-glass market buildings of Les Halles.</p>
        <p>But buildings signed (sometimes literally, in the concrete of their facades) by Hector Guimard, Le Corbusier, Richard Rogers, Oscar Niemeyer, I.M. Pei and Jean Nouvel, among many, many others, lend a dimension to Paris that New York, London and other capitals lack. One reason: the willingness of the French to grant commissions to foreigners. Note that the list includes a Swiss, a Briton and a Brazilian, as well as a Chinese-American.</p>
        <p>Our tour covers a dozen or so landmarks -- some big, some small, some angular, some streamlined -- scattered across Paris and its environs.</p>
        <p>Gustave Eiffel's extraordinary tower, 984 feet tall without its television antenna, always surprising to first-time visitors in its coat of brown paint, is so familiar from photographs (and from Dufy's and Delauney's paintings), and so universally known as the city's exclamation mark, that its architectural virtues can be overlooked.</p>
        <p>But there is great art, along with great engineering, in the elegant curvature of the four piers as they rise toward their junction halfway up the spire. Art, too, in the seeming weightlessness conferred on the giant structure by its airy iron filigree. And how many buildings have the capacity to enchant old and young alike? This one is as magical for children frolicking at its base as for the adults dining above.</p>
        <p>Hector Guimard gave fin-de-siècle Paris another of its signatures: the Métro entrances in the vegetal Art Nouveau style (derided at the time as ''noodle style''), with glass canopies held aloft by iron vines and tendrils. One of the best, most complete survivors stands at the Porte-Dauphine station.</p>
        <p>Not far away, also in the prosperous 16th Arrondissement, Guimard built a series of apartment blocks along the Rue La Fontaine, which he turned into a stylistic textbook (notice the Art Nouveau street sign at the corner of the Rue Agar). The Castel Béranger (1898), at No. 14, is remarkable not only for the different materials (glazed and unglazed brick, tufa, limestone, tile, stained glass) used to emphasize different sections of the complex building but also for the highly abstract forms of the sea-foam-green iron decorative elements.</p>
        <p>Building entirely in concrete, Auguste Perret took an important step forward in his apartments at 25 bis, rue Franklin (1904). The whole structure rests on exterior posts, with no supporting walls. This made possible the first open-plan interior, with tenants free to rearrange partition walls as they choose. In another revolutionary step, Perret scooped a shallow, concave bay from the facade, which made possible windows in all five rooms of each apartment. Tiles embossed with floral motifs, applied to the concrete skin for waterproofing purposes, make the structure look less radical than it is. It was, in fact, a trumpet call announcing the advent of modern architecture.</p>
        <p>World War I had come and gone and Cubism was in vogue when the Englishman Rob Mallet-Stevens built an astonishing group of white, markedly geometric houses and studios (1926-27) in the little cul-de-sac named for him in the 16th. Famous then, too neglected since, Mallet-Stevens combined terraces, towers and porches for sculptural effect, and pierced walls with unornamented windows like those Adolph Loos used on his ''house with no eyebrows'' in Vienna.</p>
        <p>Yellow roll-down shutters and black frames on a huge multipaned window give No. 10, open to the public three weekends each summer, a certain de Stijl jauntiness. Another house looks a bit like an ocean liner. Most have splendid railings and doors by the great metalsmith Jean Prouvé.</p>
        <p>Mallet-Stevens's contemporary, Le Corbusier, built a pair of even more pristinely white villas in this same quartier, linked at right angles to each other in the Square du Docteur Blanche. One is open to the public; the other houses the Corbusier Foundation. Both are in immaculate condition and full, inside and out, of Corbusier's well-known architectural signatures. They are miracles of compaction, small but spacious, with some rooms three stories high, some two and some one. Parts of the structure (1923-25) are raised on the cylindrical columns known as pilotis, which, the architect said, enable buildings to breathe. Long strip windows cross a blank facade. Ramps, bridges and interior balconies and windows link one room to another. A garden tops one part of the roof.</p>
        <p>All of these features reappeared a few years later (1931) in Corbusier's masterpiece, the Villa Savoye, ''a box in the air,'' as he called it, in the western suburban of Poissy, about 30 minutes from central Paris. ''The house should be set down on the grass like an object, without disturbing anything around it,'' the architect wrote of that villa. He achieved his goal; it looks as if it had been placed by a helicopter.</p>
        <p>Another building in the 16th dating from the era between the world wars deserves more than a fleeting glance: the Palais de Chaillot (1939) at the Place du Trocadéro, a spectacular, stripped-down, low-lying palace of beige stone by Jacques Carlu, whose vast horizontal sweep provides a perfect foil for the vertical thrust of the Eiffel Tower directly across the Seine.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the highly influential Maison de Verre by Pierre Chareau (1928-32) can seldom be seen. A tiny house with a glass block facade, it was inserted into the courtyard of an existing structure at 31, rue Saint-Guillaume on the Left Bank, and the big courtyard door is usually closed.</p>
        <p>In the decades after World War II, the French Communist Party achieved considerable power, and its headquarters (begun in 1971) was designed, free of charge, by the great Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, a militant party member. It is on the Place de Colonel Fabien, in the 19th Arrondissement, named for a Communist Resistance hero, and consists of a low white dome, beneath which is the central committee's meeting room, and a larger building with an undulating, gray-green glass facade behind it. Despite the intrusion of a large billboard on the lawn (''Rejoin the French Communist Party! Change the World!''), the building retains great elegance. It is perhaps the best example in Paris of the International Style.</p>
        <p>Renzo Piano, an Italian, and Richard Rogers, a Briton, stunned Paris with the Pompidou Center (1977, renovated 1998-99), familiarly known as the Beaubourg after its address, 19, rue Beaubourg, in a traditional quartier near the City Hall on the Right Bank. But it quickly became more than a museum of modern art; it became a potent tourist lure in its own right, with an average 22,000 visitors a day.</p>
        <p>To give maximum flexibility to curators mounting temporary shows, the architects went Perret and Corbusier one better by pulling the framework of the building to the outside, like an exoskeleton, along with ducts for water, heating, gas and electricity, each painted a different primary color. On the front they placed what they called ''a great escalator in a glass tube, which from inside is a unique observatory where you can see all Paris.''</p>
        <p>Two major museums have been transformed by adaptive architecture. One is the Louvre, reorganized by I.M. Pei (1989) around a central, subterranean entrance hall topped by a glass pyramid, from which all the galleries radiate. The other, less widely praised, is the Musée d'Orsay, converted by the Italian Gae Aulenti (1986) from a long-disused monumental railway station into a showcase for Impressionist and other 19th-century art, which many find jarring and disorganized. The section devoted to the important architecture and design collection is all but lost.</p>
        <p>The French modernist Jean Nouvel has given Paris several landmarks in recent decades, most notably, I think, the Institut du Monde Arabe (1987). Traditional cultures meet high-tech architecture at the institute. The long, south-facing wall of the library, for example, contains 240 small camera-lens-like metal apertures, which are opened and closed by computer to regulate the amount of sunlight that reaches the interior. These resemble mashrabiyya, the Islamic wooden screens that play the same role. From the roof terrace, you can gaze on Notre-Dame.</p>
        <p>Buildings by many other luminaries dot the cityscape; the enthusiast will quickly uncover works by Frank Gehry, Richard Meier, Tadao Ando, Ricardo Bofill and Marcel Breuer. But it is Christian de Portzamparc's Cité de la Musique (1984-95) at La Villette, in far northeastern Paris, that is most likely to thrill the visitor. It has two main parts: a conservatory on the west, really an exuberant maze of structures (including one resembling a ship's funnel), joined by walkways, and a second, public building on the east that contains a concert hall and a music library, among much else.</p>
        <p>Put off by cold contemporary architecture? Try this place. It is full of natural light, enlivened by playful contrasts, warmed by subtle color, humanized by asymmetry. The lobby feels like an outdoor plaza -- ''a covered/open, public/private space,'' in the words of the critic Ada Louise Huxtable -- with benches, signs and a cafe. Above the whole soars a unifying roof.</p>
        <p>Mr. Portzamparc's vivid creation, as Ms. Huxtable says, is a most sophisticated updating of the architecture of joy.</p>
        <p>Moderne, modern and contemporary architecture</p>
        <p>The buildings in the accompanying article can be divided into several geographical groups.</p>
