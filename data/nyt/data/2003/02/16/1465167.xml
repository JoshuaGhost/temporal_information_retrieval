        <p>CLARA</p>
        <p>By Janice Galloway.</p>
        <p>423 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $25.</p>
        <p>You are an internationally acclaimed pianist who has astonished audiences since your tender youth: Leipzig at 9, Paris at 12. You play less often now than you would like, which is largely a function of gynecology; already you have given birth to seven children. You are tired, tired, tired. For professional reasons, you have repeatedly uprooted your family. On alternate days of the week your brilliant composer of a husband, to whom you are slavishly devoted, hatches whole pieces of sublime music or whirring bats in his head. You watch helplessly as he is hauled off to an institution. The doctors advise against all communication; brutally, his disorder is written down to your fame and ambition, your tactless pregnancies. What do we have here? My thought precisely: a job for Meryl Streep.</p>
        <p>In the original the life belonged of course to Clara Schumann. It was the kind of existence that lent itself to romantic biography, which was perfectly understandable: the Schumanns had something of a monopoly on misadventure. By the time Robert Schumann's medically advised silence is relaxed, Clara has given birth to an eighth child, named for Felix Mendelssohn. Only months later, in September 1854, will an envelope arrive, bearing a half-familiar, much-longed-for scrawl. Disabled by emotion, Clara is fortunate to have at her side her closest confidant, with whom she parses every disjointed word. The friend is reminded of nothing so much as the finale of ''Fidelio.'' He is 22 years old, and madly in love with Clara. His name is Johannes Brahms. Schumann does not recover, and will be dead in less than two years.</p>
        <p>Today we no longer resort to romantic biographies. We write fiction instead. And we know a modern heroine when we see one; of late, novels about the exceptional Clara Schumann have outnumbered the lives. Janice Galloway's ambitious ''Clara'' is the most recent entry in the procession, and a shimmering piece of work it is. Clara Schumann did it all not only backward and in heels, but pregnant and before the advent of lithium. A prodigy raised in a Leipzig home bursting with pianos, she owed her career to her tyrannical father, who counted her as his greatest creation, a virtuoso rather than a woman. ''Do not forget,'' Friedrich Wieck upbraids his daughter as she kneels to unfasten his boots, ''You will never be able to repay me for all I have done for you.'' She has ultimately to be wrenched from his control by a court of law. When she and Schumann determine to marry, they need first to sue Wieck, who has publicly denounced the young composer as sexually promiscuous, musically inept, fiscally irresponsible, socially maladjusted and mentally unstable. To say nothing of his execrable handwriting. It is not so much a romantic life as an operatic one.</p>
        <p>Not only in the demands of this crowded and productive two-career household -- even in the 19th century it was evident that a home with two grand pianos needed far more than just solid walls -- does Clara speak to us today. Forty-seven volumes of diaries are her gift to us, and their existence says as much about the life as does their content. Clara's childhood notebook begins in her father's hand; up to her 19th birthday his entries outnumber hers. Was it inevitable then that on her first married morning, two years later, Robert Schumann would bestow on her a diary, to be kept mutually? He sets his conditions at the outset: ''The recording of one week may never amount to less than a single page; whoever fails in this respect shall receive some sort of punishment, which we will have to figure out. Should it occur to one member of our marital team not to turn anything in for a whole week, then the penalty will be made very much harsher -- an almost unimaginable circumstance, considering our well-known mutual high esteem and sense of duty.'' The result is either pay dirt for the novelist or reason to run swiftly in the opposite direction. Such mother lodes invoke the twin criticisms of the fictional hybrid: the author shouldn't have bothered to novelize, so closely does she hew to the original; the author has strayed so far into fiction that she should simply have invented her tale in the first place and left history unsullied.</p>
        <p>All of which serves to underline the achievement of ''Clara.'' A Scottish writer with an unsparing eye and a bold, loose-limbed energy, Galloway has managed not to trip over the diaries but to imagine her way in and around them. Clara's voice on the page is crystal clear, spirited and keen and opinionated, and yet forgiving and self-sacrificing. So what can the novelist add? A very great deal, it would seem. Galloway has taken a melodic line and scored it for an orchestra. She has managed this feat for the most part by having sunk herself deep under the skin not only of both Schumanns, but under that of Clara's sermonizing father as well, a man whose ferocious ambition allows him to pronounce in one register only. And she remains there, deep in the visceral. No strained, invented dialogue for her, no trumped-up panoramic scene settings, no homework-satisfying historical intrusions. It is a technique that works with only the occasional hiccup. Not every reader will survive Galloway's narrative disjunctions without whiplash. A typical two-paragraph swerve takes us -- via the accelerating rhythms that signal the entrance of a child into the world -- from Clara, inert in her sore and swollen body, to Robert, at the piano a floor below, valiantly fighting the impulse to run. For the record, the labor pains follow the birth announcement.</p>
        <p>The skittering about of the narrative voice takes a little getting used to, and it would seem Galloway had the same trouble. The price of admission here is her first pages, which read like a catalog of false starts, of an artist preening as she warms up, indulging in coloratura. Clara's father warns that undisciplined passion is the path to ruin; undisciplined style leads to the same place. This is a novel that could just as easily open on Page 39. A related discordant note is sounded by an early obsession with typefaces, typographic explosions that leave the reader groping for earplugs. No novelist need defer to her percussion section when she can toss off riffs like this: ''The best celebrity, after all, the kind that radiated frissons was unfailingly masculine; women -- let's be brutally honest here -- aren't serious enough. Put charisma in skirts and it became somewhat less charismatic, at least in any meaningful, which is to say lasting, way; put genius-kissed talent in a dress and it invited only drollery -- dogs walking on hind legs, etc. Women did not rise to genius, they rose to allure.''</p>
        <p>And soon Galloway is off and running, in a voice Clara Schumann would have admired: full-timbred, rich and strong. Structuring her novel along Schumann's ''Frauenliebe und Leben,'' she manages to explore the song cycle behind any passionate life and love. She is eloquent on the rusting fingers, the sodden spirits, the leaking breasts -- to say nothing of Schumann's mental frothings, where she is perhaps at her best. She captures beautifully the cramps of mind-clearing before the white page, the agonies of both the bloated and the barren imaginations, the emotional hemorrhages of a mother rocking her infant to sleep as she contemplates professional oblivion. Could there be a more perfect metaphor for the creative spirit than ''unannounced, unescorted, her piano rolled up at their door one afternoon and demanded admission''? How much more delightful to hear the news this way than simply to learn that Clara's father -- slippery as a viper,'' says Robert -- has relented one little bit, the couple having successfully sued him for slander.</p>
        <p>The Schumanns' marriage was forged of perfectly dissonant material, and Galloway allows the collisions to speak for themselves. Here was a man whose idea of happiness was to stay home alone to compose, and a woman who had been bred to perform in public, at which she earned in months what took her husband years. Galloway allows a taste of the punishments Schumann could dole out -- critical of his wife's performance even after she has won a hat-tossing ovation, he reasons, ''If young men waited outside the theater gates and autograph hunters pursued her, she was shameless; if they didn't, it was proof her playing was going to the dogs'' -- but knows she needn't bother with the reaction shot. It is curious only that her finale leaves Clara in 1856, a 37-year-old widow, with 40 years to live. This is true to the structure of ''Frauenliebe und Leben,'' but not exactly fair to Clara. Having traded the overbearing for the overreaching, she is left to head off to the simply overwhelming. Mathematically speaking, Galloway's is half a life. Literarily speaking, it is a sonorous, teeming universe.</p>
