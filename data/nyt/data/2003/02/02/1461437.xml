        <p>Justus George Lawler letter, in response to Alan Riding's Jan 19 article on Costa-Gavras's film Amen, which is based on Rolf Hochhuth's play The Deputy about Pope Pius XII and extermination of Jews; disputes Riding's contention that Pope Pius XII was silent because of his fear of German reprisals; says Hochhuth addressed issue in his play The Soldiers, which dealt with Winston Churchill's refusal to forbid fire-bombing of Dresden, city of no strategic importance, only few months before end of World War II; says Pope frequently condemned destruction of civilian centers when it was almost exclusively Luftwaffe that was doing bombing</p>

        <p>Alan Riding observes that the movie ''Amen'' by Costa-Gavras is adapted from Rolf Hochhuth's play ''The Deputy'' about Pope Pius XII and the extermination of the Jews [''The Power and the Silence in the Vatican'' by Alan Riding, Jan. 19].

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Alan Riding observes that the movie ''Amen'' by Costa-Gavras is adapted from Rolf Hochhuth's play ''The Deputy'' about Pope Pius XII and the extermination of the Jews [''The Power and the Silence in the Vatican'' by Alan Riding, Jan. 19]. The pope's silence, Mr. Riding writes, has been attributed to ''fear of German reprisals.''</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that in another play, ''The Soldiers,'' Mr. Hochhuth addressed precisely that issue. The context was Winston Churchill's refusal to forbid the fire-bombing of a city of no strategic importance, Dresden, only a few months before the end of World War II. From 1939 to 1941, Pius XII frequently condemned the destruction of civilian centers when it was almost exclusively the Luftwaffe that was doing the bombing. Clearly, he did not keep silent out of ''fear of German reprisals'' during that period.</p>
        <p>There is perhaps a clue to this seeming contradiction in the subtitle of ''The Soldiers,'' which loosely translated is: ''Obituary for the Geneva Conventions.'' In treating the failure of the Allied powers to respond to what we know as the Shoah (for example, by bombing the death camps), several authors have suggested that the systematic slaughter of a whole people was so unprecedented that it became unbelievable -- until it was too late. On the other hand, the violation of the principle of non-combatant immunity was not only condemned by international law, but also by the papally enforced doctrine of ''just war.''</p>
        <p>Churchill is the villain of ''The Soldiers.'' Pius XII is the villain of ''The Deputy.'' History's verdict on both of them is still out, apparently.</p>
