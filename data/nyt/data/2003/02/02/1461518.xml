        <p>In the world of well-paid executives and very well-paid executives, women usually fall into the first category. Not so at Scholastic, the publishing company, where Barbara A. Marcus, the president of Scholastic Book Publishing and Distribution, earns more than most of the men she works with.</p>
        <p>Scholastic finished second this year in the National Association for Female Executives' list of the ''Top 30 Companies for Executive Women'' -- in part, the group said, because ''Scholastic is the sole company where women best men as top earners.'' Avon Products, which is run by Andrea Jung, was first for the fifth year.</p>

        <p>In the world of well-paid executives and very well-paid executives, women usually fall into the first category. Not so at Scholastic, the publishing company, where Barbara A. Marcus, the president of Scholastic Book Publishing and Distribution, earns more than most of the men she works with.</p>
        <p>Scholastic finished second this year in the National Association for Female Executives' list of the ''Top 30 Companies for Executive Women'' -- in part, the group said, because ''Scholastic is the sole company where women best men as top earners.'' Avon Products, which is run by Andrea Jung, was first for the fifth year.</p>
        <p>Rounding out the top-five list, which was announced last week, are Liz Claiborne, WellPoint Health Networks and Fannie Mae. New to the list are Compuware, USAA, DuPont, Eastman Kodak, Verizon and Office Depot.</p>
        <p>Scholastic, of course, is aware that Ms. Marcus played a big role in getting one very big book. Arthur A. Levine, an editorial director at Scholastic, even gives Ms. Marcus the honorary title of ''the woman who said yes.'' Several years ago at the Bologna Children's Book Fair in Italy, he heard about a new book by an unpublished author. He got a copy of the manuscript, read it, then called Ms. Marcus and told her he wanted to bid on it at auction.</p>
        <p>The price went much higher than expected, and Mr. Levine asked Ms. Marcus if he should stay in the hunt. ''I said to him, 'If you really love it, go ahead and bid,' '' Ms. Marcus recalled. ''And we got it.''</p>
        <p>The book was ''Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone,'' and it made Scholastic a major force in publishing. Ms. Marcus does not, however, credit the boy wizard with her success. ''I was making the same before Harry Potter,'' she said. Which says something about Scholastic.</p>
        <p>''It's a wonderful place to work,'' she said. ''It's a business, but one that really has its heart in the right place.''</p>
