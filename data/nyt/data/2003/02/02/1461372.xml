        <p>Letter from Zbigniew Brzezinski says Douglas Brinkley's account of alleged betrayal of Secretary of State Cyrus Vance by Pres Carter's decision to undertake 1980 hostage rescue mission in Iran omits salient facts (Dec 29 The Lives They Lived article)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Douglas Brinkley's account (The Lives They Lived, Dec. 29) of the alleged betrayal of Secretary Vance by President Carter's decision to undertake the April 1980 hostage rescue mission -- made at a National Security Council meeting said to have been ''hastily'' convened in Vance's absence -- omits salient facts.</p>
        <p>Sometime prior to the formal N.S.C. session, a comprehensive review of the planned mission had been held in Camp David, with all the N.S.C. principals in attendance. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs reported in detail on the military plans, and the director of Central Intelligence did so in regard to covert action support. Vance had even earlier joined me in recommending in writing that the president approve a covert and somewhat risky flight by a United States aircraft, including a surreptitious landing in Iran, to reconnoiter one of the operational sites for the mission. Had Vance been so unalterably opposed to a rescue attempt, he presumably would not have concurred in that recommendation.</p>
        <p>The decision to hold the N.S.C. session on the rescue mission was precipitated by news that negotiations for release of the hostages had failed and not by Vance's absence. (It was only two hours flying time from where he was vacationing.) Acting Secretary Warren Christopher appeared in his absence. When Vance subsequently made his objections clear, a follow-on session of the N.S.C. was convened so that he could state his case. None of its members agreed with him.</p>
        <p>Brinkley cites Richard Holbrooke's comments regarding Christopher's alleged failure to keep Vance fully informed. Warren Christopher's integrity requires no defense.</p>
