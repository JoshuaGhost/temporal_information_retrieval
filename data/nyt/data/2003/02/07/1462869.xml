        <p>Taking Care Of All the Goo</p>
        <p>Slimy and slippery though it may be, Vaseline has been in Matthew Barney's sculptures and films since the beginning of his career. Now, as the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum prepares for ''Matthew Barney: The Cremaster Cycle,'' a major exhibition that includes his five-part film cycle along with related sculptures, photographs and drawings, it faces an unusual challenge.</p>
        <p>A ton of Vaseline will be used in the show, and some of it must be kept cool. The museum needed approval from the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission to build a wooden enclosure 16 feet long and 6 feet tall and 6 feet wide on the roof of its Fifth Avenue building for housing air-conditioning units to chill the Vaseline. Permission was granted last week, said Nancy Spector, curator of contemporary art at the Guggenheim.</p>
        <p>The enclosure, to be painted off-white to match the exterior of the landmark building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, will not be visible from the street. It is to be removed when the show closes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barney has always used materials that are organic and that change as metaphors for the body and also as allusions to materials like hot lead that Richard Serra would literally throw to make sculptures. Vaseline will be seen running down the interior of the Guggenheim's rotunda in specially designed troughs. Frozen Vaseline will cover the front of an Art Deco bar. Ms. Spector said a hidden hose, fed from the roof enclosure through the museum's lighting system, would keep the Vaseline on the bar at 17 degrees so it holds its shape.</p>
        <p>Cast Vaseline is visible in some of Mr. Barney's sculptures, and molten Vaseline is splashed on a sculpture and runs down the ramp from the top of the Guggenheim. Vaseline also appears throughout ''Cremaster,'' the artist's five-part film cycle, which will be screened daily at the Guggenheim during the show's run, from Feb. 21 through June 11.</p>
        <p>''We do some complex and eccentric exhibitions,'' Ms. Spector said. ''This is among the most exhilarating.'' But using materials like Vaseline presents challenges. For instance, what happens if a visitor touches the Vaseline? ''We always encourage people not to touch the art,'' she said. ''But since we can't always guarantee that will happen, we will have paper towels on hand.''</p>
        <p>A Mistake by Sotheby's</p>
        <p>The phones started ringing at Sotheby's recently as customers complained that some of their purchases or sales had been omitted from a list of transactions used to compute the money owed them as part of a $512 million class-action lawsuit. Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, the law firm, filed the suit representing 130,000 customers who lost millions of dollars when the Sotheby's chairman and its chief executive colluded with their counterparts at Christie's.</p>
        <p>That lawsuit was settled in February 2001, and customers are still waiting for their money. When Sotheby's executives began investigating the calls, they say, they discovered that the auction house had inadvertently omitted about 17,000 transactions from its calculations.</p>
        <p>Missing were records of items initially offered at auction that had failed to sell but later did sell. (Christie's did include these transactions in the information submitted to the settlement administrator.)</p>
        <p>According to court papers, supplemental claim forms will be sent out today to 8,324 people. Lawyers for these customers say they want payments issued as soon as possible, which could be as early as April, subject to the court's approval.</p>
        <p>A Bounty for Boston</p>
        <p>Sometimes when museums compete for collections, the outcome can be unexpected, as in the case of the latest gift to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: 60 paintings, drawings and sculpture amassed by two New York doctors, Frank Purnell, who died in 1996, and Melvin Blake, who died in 1999.</p>
        <p>The collection includes 20 works by contemporary Latin American artists, among them 12 works by Claudio Bravo; 19 works from the Spanish Realist School, among them 8 by Antonio López Gárcia; and 10 objects by such modern and contemporary European and American artists as Larry Rivers, Lucian Freud and Balthus.</p>
        <p>In 1998 the collection was the subject of one of the first loan shows presented by the Guggenheim's museum in Bilbao, Spain. Not only did the Guggenheim want the collection, but so did the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid.</p>
        <p>How did it end up in Boston? ''I think the executors felt it was possible to make a difference in Boston,'' said Malcolm Rogers, director of the Museum of Fine Arts. ''This gift both complements our collection and adds great strength in areas where we are weak.''</p>
        <p>A Magritte and a Delvaux in the collection are the first Surrealist paintings to enter the museum. Works by Mr. Freud, Balthus and R. B. Kitaj will be the first by these artists in the museum. The gift will also strengthen the museum's holdings in Latin American art.</p>
        <p>''A Singular Vision: The Melvin Blake and Frank Purnell Legacy'' opened this week at the museum and runs through Aug. 24.</p>
        <p>An Unexpected Bequest</p>
        <p>Phyllis Wattis, the philanthropist who died in June, was a generous donor to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Over the years she either gave or promised the museum many important artworks, as well as money. Recently the museum learned that Wattis also left it four artworks it had always hoped to get but did not expect: three by Yves Klein and one by Donald Judd.</p>
        <p>''We now become the second greatest repository of works by Klein after the Menil in Houston,'' said Neal Benezra, the director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. ''With this gift we now have three sculptures and two paintings by him.''</p>
        <p>All three Kleins are from 1961. Two are sculptures from his well-known series of sponges, and the third, which is untitled, is a painting inspired by Duchamp's ''Nude Descending a Staircase.''</p>
        <p>The Judd, an untitled work from 1962, is a painting with a yellow oval carved out of a textured red background.</p>
