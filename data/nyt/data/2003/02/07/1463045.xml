        <p>Coca-Cola Co, in setback for McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, awards creative duties in North America for its flagship soft drink brand Coca-Cola Classic to Berlin Cameron/Red Cell (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In a setback for McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York and its parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies, the Coca-Cola Company has formally awarded creative duties in North America for its flagship soft drink brand, Coca-Cola Classic, to Berlin Cameron/Red Cell in New York.</p>
        <p>The shift, announced yesterday, came a month after Coca-Cola introduced a campaign for the brand, carrying the theme ''Coca-Cola . . . Real,'' that was produced by Berlin Cameron, part of the Red Cell division of the WPP Group, rather than by McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of Interpublic. Coca-Cola is to spend about $250 million this year on ''Real'' ads in North America.</p>

        <p>In a setback for McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York and its parent, the Interpublic Group of Companies, the Coca-Cola Company has formally awarded creative duties in North America for its flagship soft drink brand, Coca-Cola Classic, to Berlin Cameron/Red Cell in New York.</p>
        <p>The shift, announced yesterday, came a month after Coca-Cola introduced a campaign for the brand, carrying the theme ''Coca-Cola . . . Real,'' that was produced by Berlin Cameron, part of the Red Cell division of the WPP Group, rather than by McCann-Erickson, part of the McCann-Erickson World Group division of Interpublic. Coca-Cola is to spend about $250 million this year on ''Real'' ads in North America.</p>
        <p>Though McCann-Erickson and Interpublic remain the lead partners for creative work on the brand throughout much of the rest of the world, the anointment of Berlin Cameron, a much smaller agency, is a major disappointment. It could potentially augur similar moves; for instance, in Britain, Coca-Cola has asked an independent London agency named Mother to contribute creative ideas for the brand along with the McCann-Erickson office there.</p>
        <p>Berlin Cameron also creates campaigns for Coca-Cola brands like Dasani, Mello Yello and Nestea. A sibling WPP agency, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, handles the Sprite brand for Coca-Cola, so the shift represents another WPP inroad on the account at the expense of Interpublic.</p>
