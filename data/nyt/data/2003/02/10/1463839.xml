        <p>It's one of the oldest tricks in hip-hop: if you want people's attention (and what rapper doesn't?), act as if you have something really important to say. On Tuesday night Dead Prez and Killer Mike came to S.O.B.'s for a strident, entertaining night of rhyming and posturing; nearly every verse was delivered as an urgent message.</p>
        <p>The two members of Dead Prez, Sticman and M-1, present themselves as black-nationalist revolutionaries, and their repertory is built around an arsenal of slogans. The set began with a few selections from ''Turn Off the Radio'' (Full Clip), which retrofits hip-hop hits with rabble-rousing lyrics.</p>

        <p>It's one of the oldest tricks in hip-hop: if you want people's attention (and what rapper doesn't?), act as if you have something really important to say. On Tuesday night Dead Prez and Killer Mike came to S.O.B.'s for a strident, entertaining night of rhyming and posturing; nearly every verse was delivered as an urgent message.</p>
        <p>The two members of Dead Prez, Sticman and M-1, present themselves as black-nationalist revolutionaries, and their repertory is built around an arsenal of slogans. The set began with a few selections from ''Turn Off the Radio'' (Full Clip), which retrofits hip-hop hits with rabble-rousing lyrics.</p>
        <p>The duo borrowed an old Notorious B.I.G. song that included the couplet ''Time to get paid/Blow up like the World Trade.'' The new version went, ''Time to get free/Blow up like Cincinnati,'' in reference to the 2001 riots there.</p>
        <p>It sometimes seems that Dead Prez sees hip-hop as merely a a way of spreading the message, and in this sense the group's music is a form of cultural exploitation. More than once the long-winded verses overpowered the stark, twitchy beats these rappers love. It's a good thing, then, that they balance zeal with exuberance. The group was formed in Florida, and the members have been influenced by the slick, tricky rhyme style popular in the Southeast. The digressions were entertaining, too: the duo inveighed against the term hip-hop (''A real soft word for 'black culture' '') and demonstrated the importance of calisthenics by doing 50 push-ups.</p>
        <p>Killer Mike's set was driven by a less programmatic kind of urgency, and that's probably a good thing; he's a big guy, and it seems unlikely that he could get through 50 push-ups, no matter what. He's a protégé of the Atlanta group OutKast, known for invigorating its off-kilter songs with harsh, furious verses. His impressive debut album, ''Monster'' (Aquemini/Columbia), is due later this month, and Killer Mike seemed nervous to be performing before an audience that didn't know his music.</p>
        <p>Still, his quick wit and booming voice were impossible to resist. He did an exhilarating version of his current single, ''AKshon (Yeah!),'' based on a xylophone-driven rhythm in 12/8 time. For ''A.D.I.D.A.S.'' (''All Day I Dream About Sex''), he turned a clever lust song into a safe-sex warning, saying ''I don't need that A-I-D-S/A 'D' and an 'A' missing out my Adidas.'' He threw condoms into the crowd and asked people to buy his album to help him support his family: ''I got a lot of kids, 'cause I didn't use those.''</p>
