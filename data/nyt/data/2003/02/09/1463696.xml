        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re: ''Aiming to Ground a Plan to Expand a Runway'' (Jan. 19). I live in Milford, directly across from the airport on the approach path to Runway 6/24. I am also a retired pilot of a major carrier.</p>
        <p>I was on the Master Plan Update Advisory Committee and on the Environmental Impact Study Advisory Committee regarding the upgrade, not expansion, of Runway 6/24 at Sikorsky Airport. On these committees were both individuals and groups, most of whom lived in Stratford.</p>
        <p>Heading these committees were consultants hired by the Federal Aviation Administration to come up with the best plan for reconstructing Runway 6/24, which, although still a safe runway, was fast approaching the end of its useful life (the F.A.A. considers 25 years the useful life of a runway). These were six years of intense and sometimes acrimonious meetings along with an occasional public hearing.</p>
        <p>The new runway will be exactly the same length as it is today. The reason for moving the road is to allow for runway safety areas on each end of the runway. The approach lighting system will be entirely within the airport boundary and not encroach on the wetlands.</p>
        <p>The Department of Transportation approved the plan Oct. 5, 1999, based primarily on its concerns for the safety of those people using Sikorsky. No airplane larger than those currently using Sikorsky will be able to use the new runway.</p>
