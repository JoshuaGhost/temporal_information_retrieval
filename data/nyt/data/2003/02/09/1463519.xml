        <p>ELKHART and Goshen, two small cities in northern Indiana, are a hotbed of job creation. How could it be?</p>
        <p>The metropolitan area they anchor seems about the least likely place to have boomed in 2002. It says it has the nation's highest concentration of manufacturing, and this is a time when manufacturers are mired in a deep downturn.</p>
        <p>But a comeback in the recreational-vehicle industry after a slump in 2001 helped give Elkhart-Goshen greater job growth than any other metropolitan area last year: -- 4.6 percent. With the Sept. 11 attacks still limiting foreign travel, sales of R.V.'s have jumped, and Monaco Coach, Keystone RV and Dutchmen are all adding workers in the area, which is near the Michigan border.</p>
        <p>Across the country, employment rolls fell 0.2 percent last year, but some areas managed to do well. Almost 140 of the 316 metropolitan areas added jobs; among the biggest gainers were centers for tourism or the military, according to Economy.com, a research company that follows regional trends.</p>
        <p>Of course, job growth doesn't always mean that an area is booming. Elkhart-Goshen's work force at the end of 2002 totaled 122,500 people, still about 5 percent below the level three years ago.</p>
        <p>''It's making its way back,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, ''but it's coming off a very low bottom.''</p>
        <p>Several areas are posting record employment numbers, thanks to strong job growth last year. Like Elkhart-Goshen, at least three other metropolitan areas -- Biloxi, Miss. (second on the Economy.com list), Las Vegas (eighth) and Atlantic City (ninth) -- are benefiting from the gain in domestic tourism. Each of the three is drawing people to its casinos.</p>
        <p>Biloxi has also been helped by another reaction to Sept. 11: the increase in military and security spending. Employment is up at its Air Force base, just as it has grown at the border security office in McAllen, Tex. (fourth on the list); at Los Alamos National Laboratory near Santa Fe, N.M. (fifth); and at the Army base in Tacoma, Wash. (seventh).</p>
        <p>Completing the top 10 were Fayetteville, Ark. (third), where Wal-Mart and its suppliers continue to expand; Chico, Calif. (sixth), where affordable housing is wooing new residents; and Madison, Wis., where financial services are growing.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the spectrum, the bottom 10 areas highlight the surprising nature of Elkhart-Goshen's growth. The list of areas with the biggest employment declines is filled with manufacturing hubs, including Florence, Ala., and Flint, Mich., not for from Elkhart-Goshen. Technology centers like San Jose, Calif., are also still shrinking.</p>
        <p>The economy began growing again in late 2001, but companies kept eliminating jobs. About 100 metropolitan areas remain in recession, according to Economy.com.</p>
        <p>''They're everywhere,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''They're not just in one region. They're not just in one corner of the country. They're coast to coast.''</p>
