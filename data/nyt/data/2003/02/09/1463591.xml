        <p>To the Editor,</p>
        <p>In the Coping column (''A Bittersweet Honor for a 9/11 Victim,'' Feb. 2), I was puzzled by the following comment: ''Despite promises that the new Council would deal with big issues, its powers have been so eroded that naming streets is one of the few areas of influence it has left.''</p>
        <p>Eroded? Hardly. Since charter revision eliminated the old Board of Estimate, the Council has had increased power.</p>
        <p>In just over a year the new Council raised property taxes 18.5 percent, banned smoking virtually everywhere except the home, passed a living wage bill, overrode the mayor's veto after they altered the term-limit statute, outlawed cellphone use at public performances, instituted job protection for building maintenance workers, streamlined the process by which a restaurant gets permission to install a sidewalk cafe and expanded the ban on the illegal posting of advertisements.</p>
        <p>This year the Council will probably ban aluminum baseball bats in Little League games, require that bars, restaurants, stores and all other buildings that hold more than 240 people have baby-changing stations, set up a commission to study reparations for descendants of slaves and require street artists to obtain a permit to sell their goods. These are not ''big issues''?</p>
