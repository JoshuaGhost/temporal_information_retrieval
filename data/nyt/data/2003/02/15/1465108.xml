        <p>The French bank Crédit Lyonnais said that net profit more than tripled in the fourth quarter, helped by strong retail growth. Fourth-quarter net profit was 241 million euros ($261 million), up from 78 million euros ($84.5 million) a year earlier. For the year, net profit rose 5 percent, to 853 million euros ($924 million). The chairman, Jean Peyrelevade, said earnings should continue to rise in 2003 if economic conditions did not deteriorate. The results improve its case for a planned merger with a French rival, Crédit Agricole. The plan is being reviewed by the French bank regulator.</p>
