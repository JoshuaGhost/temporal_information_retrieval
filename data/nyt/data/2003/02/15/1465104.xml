        <p>The British bank Lloyds TSB Group reported a 40 percent decline in profit for the second half of 2002, blaming rising provisions for bad loans and a lingering bear market for stocks. Net income for the period was £668 million ($1.1 billion), compared with £1.1 billion ($1.8 billion) a year earlier. The bank froze its dividend and said it would need to invest money in its pension fund to compensate for falling stock prices. Rising provisions for bad loans and falling stock prices have also hit other British banks, including Barclays and Abbey National.</p>
