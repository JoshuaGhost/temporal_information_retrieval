        <p>On-again, off-again discussions at the Interpublic Group of Companies about merging Bozell in New York into Lowe &amp; Partners Worldwide have resumed, according to agency executives involved in the talks. The discussions have reached a point where Bozell's clients are being approached for responses to such a combination.</p>
        <p>Client reaction is important because conflicts could result from a merger of Bozell, which operates from a single office in New York, into Lowe. For instance, some post-merger plans call for the Bank of America assignment now at Bozell to be shifted to another Interpublic agency because it could not be handled by Lowe, which works for a competitor, HSBC, the international banking company with substantial interests in America.</p>

        <p>On-again, off-again discussions at the Interpublic Group of Companies about merging Bozell in New York into Lowe &amp; Partners Worldwide have resumed, according to agency executives involved in the talks. The discussions have reached a point where Bozell's clients are being approached for responses to such a combination.</p>
        <p>Client reaction is important because conflicts could result from a merger of Bozell, which operates from a single office in New York, into Lowe. For instance, some post-merger plans call for the Bank of America assignment now at Bozell to be shifted to another Interpublic agency because it could not be handled by Lowe, which works for a competitor, HSBC, the international banking company with substantial interests in America.</p>
        <p>Although the talks are continuing, the executives said, a deal is still not assured. But, the executives said, the merger is being considered far more seriously than previously.</p>
        <p>Telephone calls to spokeswomen for Bozell and Lowe were referred to Philippe Krakowsky, a spokesman for Interpublic in New York. Mr. Krakowsky said: ''We constantly look for ways to provide better service to our clients. If combining operations or encouraging our companies to collaborate in new ways offers such benefits, we will always consider it.''</p>
        <p>The executives said the resumption of the talks was not directly related to the financial problems of Interpublic but described the potential cost savings from a combination as increasingly attractive. Both agencies have been involved in mergers before: Lowe was combined with Lintas, which had previously absorbed Ammirati &amp; Puris, and Bozell resulted from a merger of Bozell &amp; Jacobs and Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt.</p>
