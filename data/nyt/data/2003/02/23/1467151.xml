        <p>Article on possible demise of shisha cafes on Astoria Boulevard in Queens; shisha are ornate water pipes that filter flavored tobacco; cafes, despite their popularity among local Middle Eastern residents, may have to close under city's new Smoke-Free Air Act; photo (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>New York has no official Little Middle East, but the two blocks of Steinway Street between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard in Queens come close. Yemeni, Moroccans, Egyptians and other Arab immigrants live, work and shop along this strip. Bookstores such as IPCI (International Publications of Islamic Culture) sell copies of the Koran, and the windows of delis are lined with big, green cans of ghee, the clarified butter popular in Middle Eastern cuisine. The signs for the barber, the tailor and the dentist are all in Arabic. At Laziza (Arabic for ''delicious'') Bakery, the favorite is savory, sweet kanafa, a Palestinian dessert of pomegranate juice and white cheese atop thin pastry.</p>
        <p>At the heart of this community in Astoria are the shisha cafes. Six of them dot the two-block stretch, each with a handful of small wooden tables and a stable of the ornate namesake water pipes that filter flavored tobacco -- apple is the most popular -- for patrons.</p>

        <p>New York has no official Little Middle East, but the two blocks of Steinway Street between 28th Avenue and Astoria Boulevard in Queens come close. Yemeni, Moroccans, Egyptians and other Arab immigrants live, work and shop along this strip. Bookstores such as IPCI (International Publications of Islamic Culture) sell copies of the Koran, and the windows of delis are lined with big, green cans of ghee, the clarified butter popular in Middle Eastern cuisine. The signs for the barber, the tailor and the dentist are all in Arabic. At Laziza (Arabic for ''delicious'') Bakery, the favorite is savory, sweet kanafa, a Palestinian dessert of pomegranate juice and white cheese atop thin pastry.</p>
        <p>At the heart of this community in Astoria are the shisha cafes. Six of them dot the two-block stretch, each with a handful of small wooden tables and a stable of the ornate namesake water pipes that filter flavored tobacco -- apple is the most popular -- for patrons.</p>
        <p>''I'd say they bring as much as 50 percent of the business to this block,'' said Rafea Nablsi, one of the owners of Laziza.</p>
        <p>Now the centuries-old tradition of shisha, and those cafes, face the specter of the city's new Smoke-Free Air Act. When the law goes into effect on March 30, it will leave little wiggle room for the shisha cafes.</p>
        <p>Some New York establishments, notably cigar bars, will be grandfathered under a short list of Health Department exceptions. But shisha bars represent a singular business model. The owners estimate that two-thirds of revenue comes from the sale of tobacco products, but because they also serve coffee and tea, they must be licensed as restaurants. And restaurants, as the law stands now, will not be permitted to have indoor smoking under any circumstance.</p>
        <p>City Council member Peter Vallone Jr., who represents this section of Queens, acknowledges that the shisha bars may have been overlooked in negotiations.</p>
        <p>''I don't think most of us were aware of this type of location,'' he said. ''I would love to say that something can be done about it, but as one of 51 Council members, it would be very hard at this late hour.''</p>
        <p>The arrangement strikes Said Ahmed, the owner of the Al Sukaria Caf√©, as highly unfair. ''It sends the message that you can drink alcohol and smoke, but you can't drink coffee and smoke,'' he said. ''Is this what the city is trying to say?''</p>
        <p>Farid el-Baghdadi, who was minding his cousin's cafe, El Khayam, just down the block, added: ''It will kill our business. We can try to have people outside in the summer. But people come to these cafes to sit with friends and smoke shisha.''</p>
        <p>For a community already beset by tougher restrictions covering immigration registration, closing the shisha cafes would mean not just the loss of a cultural institution but also the loss of up to 40 jobs.</p>
        <p>On any weekday evening, the cafes are packed, mostly with Middle Eastern men watching the news on Al Jazeera or movies on ART, the Arabic Radio Television, chatting with friends and playing backgammon. And everyone -- everyone -- is smoking shisha pipes. Light reflects from the red, blue and green glass tubes as they pass among friends. ''People come to smoke to get a taste of back home,'' said George Hawat, who was smoking shisha at Al Sukaria. ''Shisha to an Arab is like cappuccino to an Italian. If this cafe closes, my social life will be shut down.''</p>
        <p>And at Mazazique Cafe, Ali el-Ride added between greetings to customers: ''The law is ridiculous. The only people who come here are people who want to smoke. Who is the law protecting?''</p>
