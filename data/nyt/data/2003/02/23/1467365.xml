        <p>Homeowners with beachfront property have no choice but to take the law into their own hands. The Town of Southampton has never been in favor of people owning homes on the ocean, but never had a problem with collecting taxes from them. I was the first person who disobeyed them and built a steel interlocking retaining wall -- the same wall that was shown in your cover photograph [''Back From the Edge,'' Feb. 2] -- to protect my home, 661 Dune Road. My two neighbors were also fed up with the town and joined me in this huge effort, at huge expense, to save their homes as well. This was approximately 20 years ago. My house was saved, no thanks to town officials and they turned around and fined me $30,000.</p>
