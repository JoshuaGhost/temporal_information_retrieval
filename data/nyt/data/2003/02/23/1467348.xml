        <p>Birds made by Atlantic Coast carvers are featured at Long Island's 32nd annual waterfowl decoy show today in Patchogue, N.Y., among them the works of Elmer Crowell, the Ward brothers, Thomas Gelston, Bill Bowman, John Dilley and Obadiah Verity.</p>
        <p>One of Crowell's decoys, a preening pintail drake, set a record for an American waterfowl decoy last month at a Christie's auction in New York when it was bought, on behalf of a client, by the Boston dealer Stephen O'Brien Jr., for $801,500. Crowell, who was born in Harwich, Mass., in 1862, began fashioning decoys when he was 14.</p>

Crowell, who was born in Harwich, Mass., in 1862, began fashioning decoys when he was 14.</p>
        <p>Crowell produced many working decoys as well as miniature, decorative items, including shorebirds and songbirds, and he was as gifted at painting his birds as he was at carving them. He died in 1952.</p>
        <p>The show -- arranged by the Long Island Decoy Collectors Association -- is at the Knights of Columbus hall, a short walk from the Patchogue railroad station. More than 100 exhibitors will be showing and selling decoys, fishing tackle, books, prints and paintings. Hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.; tickets cost $5, with no charge to those under 12.</p>
