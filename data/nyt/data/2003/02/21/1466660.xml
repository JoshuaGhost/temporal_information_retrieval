        <p>Federal prosecutors brought racketeering charges today against a Florida professor and seven other people, accusing them of financing and helping support suicide bombings in Israel.</p>
        <p>In one of the Justice Department's longest-running and most controversial terrorism investigations, a 50-count grand jury indictment unsealed in Tampa relies heavily on expanded prosecutorial powers granted to the department after the Sept. 11 attacks.</p>
        <p>The indictment charges that Palestinian Islamic Jihad, linked to more than 100 killings in Israel, has been deeply rooted within the United States since the 1980's, using American academic and fund-raising groups as fronts.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors charged that Sami Al-Arian, a suspended professor at the University of South Florida whose case has become a cause célèbre for Arab-Americans and free-speech advocates, was the group's North American leader and conducted a wide-ranging conspiracy to funnel money, support and logistical advice to terrorists operating out of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>But Arab-American leaders quickly rallied to Mr. Al-Arian's defense, and his lawyer declared him a political prisoner.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials and terrorism specialists said the indictment represented one of the most important prosecutions to emerge from the Justice Department's stepped-up efforts to apprehend people in the United States believed to have provided support for terrorists abroad. It will also provide an important first test of the government's expanded powers to use intelligence gathered in foreign surveillance operations in a domestic criminal investigation, experts said.</p>
        <p>Steven Emerson, a terrorism expert who has complained about Mr. Al-Arian's activities in the United States for nearly a decade, said today that he was gratified that the government had finally taken action.</p>
        <p>''The indictment shows an elaborate, sophisticated, comprehensive campaign, going back to 1984, and explicitly how Al-Arian and others were serving as actual leaders of a militant Islamic group within the U.S.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While suspicions of terrorist ties have swirled around Mr. Al-Arian for years because of his outspoken advocacy for Palestinian causes, the authorities said they were stymied in bringing charges against him because of restrictions that, before the passage of the 2001 Patriot Act, limited the use of foreign intelligence information in criminal cases.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said much of the material used to produce today's indictment was not even made available to them until several months ago, even though it details planning and payments a decade old.</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Arian, according to the 121-page indictment, was the North American leader of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or P.I.J. American authorities first designated the group as a terrorist organization in 1995 and blame it for the killings of more than 100 people in the West Bank and Gaza, including two young American women. Among the most recent attacks linked to the group was a suicide bombing in Haifa, Israel, on June 5, 2002, that killed 20 people and injured 50.</p>
        <p>The indictment maintains that the University of South Florida, where Mr. Al-Arian taught computer engineering and where one other defendant also worked as an instructor, provided a place where Palestinian jihad members ''could receive cover as teachers or students.''</p>
        <p>The eight defendants charged today -- four American residents who were taken into custody and four others overseas who are still being sought -- would face up to 20 years in prison if convicted, officials said.</p>
        <p>Led away in handcuffs by F.B.I. agents in Florida after his arrest this morning, Mr. Al-Arian told reporters, ''It's all about politics.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Arian, 45, and two other defendants arrested with him -- Sameeh Hammoudeh, 42, of Temple Terrace, Fla., and Hatima Naji Fariz, 30, of Spring Hill, Fla. -- appeared in Federal District Court in Tampa today, where Judge Mark Pizzo ordered them held without bail pending a hearing next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Arian's defense lawyer, Nicholas M. Matassini, asked that the defendants be given copies of the Koran in their cells and told the judge that his client would begin a hunger strike in jail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Matassini said the indictment was ''a work of fiction.'' He accused the government of holding Mr. Al-Arian as a ''political prisoner,'' adding: ''He loves this country. He has a right to his political views.''</p>
        <p>Arab-American groups portrayed Mr. Al-Arian as the victim of a witch-hunt and challenged the credibility of the evidence against him.</p>
        <p>''We are very concerned that the government would bring charges after investigating an individual for many years without offering any evidence of criminal activity,'' said Omar Ahmad, chairman of the Council on American-Islamic Relations in Washington.</p>
        <p>The F.B.I. has been investigating Mr. Al-Arian and his possible links to terrorism since at least the early 1990's, just a few years after he became a permanent resident of the United States. He was born in Kuwait and first came to the United States in 1978 to attend North Carolina State University, becoming a permanent resident in 1989.</p>
        <p>Around that time, the authorities said, he began attending organizing meetings around the United States for fellow pro-Palestinian advocates who wanted to raise money and recruit members to their cause.</p>
        <p>The indictment suggests that the F.B.I. began aggressively monitoring Mr. Al-Arian's activities and bugging his conversations in the early 1990's, and law enforcement officials said agents used powers granted the Justice Department under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</p>
        <p>In a 1991 meeting in Cleveland of pro-Palestinians -- one of dozens of detailed conversations, phone calls and meetings cited by prosecutors -- Mr. Al-Arian is said to have urged his followers to ''damn the allies of America and Israel unto death'' and to go to the Holy Land for Muslims in order to commit jihad, according to the indictment.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors said Mr. Al-Arian and the other defendants were also actively involved in helping P.I.J. to organize overseas. And the indictment listed numerous payments, some totaling $100,000 or more, that Mr. Al-Arian and his followers are said to have made in the 1990's to support terrorism operations and to provide money to the families of suicide ''martyrs'' killed in terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the indictment said, Mr. Al-Arian received a three-page fax ''listing people killed and names and account numbers of people receiving money on their behalf.''</p>
        <p>The indictment also says there are close ties between the group and Syria, which long served as host to its leader, and Iran, which provided it with money. It also says P.I.J. members tried to disguise Iran's contributions by speaking in code, referring to Iran as ''the north.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Al-Arian and Bashir Musa Mohammed Nafi, an Egyptian-born professor at a Muslim college in England, are also charged with obstructing justice by purportedly giving false statements to American authorities who were trying to deport Al-Arian's brother-in-law, Mazen Al-Najjar. Mr. Al-Najjar was incarcerated for four years in Florida on secret evidence because of his purported ties to terrorists and was deported last year.</p>
        <p>Rita Katz, a terrorism analyst, called the indictments a breakthrough by targeting a group other than Al Qaeda. ''Al Qaeda is not our only enemy in the war on terror,'' Ms. Katz said.</p>
