        <p>About 40 percent of the New York-New Jersey Highlands, a swath of the Appalachians, is worthy of protection from overdevelopment, according to a study released today by the United States Forest Service. But less than half of the area, which encompasses 1.5 million acres from the Delaware River on the west side of New Jersey to the New York-Connecticut border in northern Westchester County, is now under such protection, the federal study found.</p>
        <p>The study provides detailed analysis of the area's watersheds, wildlife habitats and recreational sites, and outlines strategies for land planning aimed at protecting the area from overuse. It also says that the highlands' population increased by 11 percent from 1990 to 2000, and that about 100,000 acres face imminent pressure from development.</p>

        <p>About 40 percent of the New York-New Jersey Highlands, a swath of the Appalachians, is worthy of protection from overdevelopment, according to a study released today by the United States Forest Service. But less than half of the area, which encompasses 1.5 million acres from the Delaware River on the west side of New Jersey to the New York-Connecticut border in northern Westchester County, is now under such protection, the federal study found.</p>
        <p>The study provides detailed analysis of the area's watersheds, wildlife habitats and recreational sites, and outlines strategies for land planning aimed at protecting the area from overuse. It also says that the highlands' population increased by 11 percent from 1990 to 2000, and that about 100,000 acres face imminent pressure from development.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists and others awaiting federal leadership on efforts to protect the highlands, which the Forest Service called ''a landscape of national significance'' in a 1992 study, complained that the report contained no specific recommendations on how to prevent overdevelopment of the land.</p>
        <p>''It's an excellent report,'' said Tom Gilbert, executive director of the Highlands Coalition, a consortium of 100 organizations interested in preserving the area's natural resources. ''But it doesn't necessarily spell out very clearly how we're going to protect those lands.''</p>
        <p>In particular, critics of the report said, it does not say how many acres the government believes should be taken out of private hands for preservation, and who should pay for it.</p>
        <p>The Highlands Coalition -- which includes the Sierra Club, the New Jersey Audubon Society and the League of Women Voters -- almost a year ago proposed saving 180,000 acres in New York and New Jersey at a cost of $750 million. At the same time, Congress had provided only $7 million to save 25,000 acres.</p>
        <p>Kathryn P. Maloney, the Forest Service's director for the Northeast, said the study was a scientific document meant to provide details about the area's resources and the forces at play to develop them.</p>
        <p>''We purposely kept out of the study endorsements of certain actions, certain policies,'' Ms. Maloney aid. ''There's no specificity around who really has the authority and the responsibility to do that.''</p>
        <p>But that process is already at work, she said. Several Congressional representatives who have been spearheading efforts to protect the area made it a requirement in budget appropriations that the secretaries of agriculture and the interior come up with recommendations about how to preserve the highlands. Those recommendations may be made public soon, Ms. Maloney said.</p>
        <p>Those members of Congress include Representative Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican who helped secure funding for the study and who attended the briefing, which was held at the New Jersey State Botanical Garden in Ringwood State Park.</p>
        <p>''The heightening of awareness of the crisis here, of too much development, is a positive situation,'' Mr. Frelinghuysen said, adding that there was now more talk in many quarters, from the White House to private fund-raising organizations, about how to save the highlands.</p>
