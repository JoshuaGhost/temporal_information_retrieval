        <p>Two years ago, Donna Brazile, then Al Gore's campaign manager, was engaged in daily combat with Karl Rove, then George W. Bush's top campaign strategist.</p>
        <p>Today, they chirpily exchange e-mail, chat on the phone and write letters, indulging in their shared zeal for the inner workings of politics.</p>
        <p>''I like her a lot,'' said Mr. Rove, now ensconced in the West Wing as President Bush's chief political adviser.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brazile, a committed Democrat who was the first black woman to manage a presidential campaign, has built similar relationships with other Republicans, like Grover Norquist, an influential conservative strategist. And her coziness with them comes as she is deeply frustrated with her own party for what she calls years of taking African-Americans for granted and for failing to organize for elections in a coherent way.</p>
        <p>In fact, Ms. Brazile's alienation could well be viewed as emblematic of a Democratic Party in disarray.</p>
        <p>For years Ms. Brazile, 43, has worked diligently in the trenches for Democrats, mobilizing the black vote. She worked on Representative Richard A. Gephardt's last presidential primary campaign, in 1988. She was fired from Michael S. Dukakis's presidential campaign later that year for impolitic remarks about his opponent, Vice President George Bush. After pulling out record numbers of black voters for Mr. Gore in 2000, she helped engineer one of the few Democratic victories in 2002, rebuffing an intense Republican campaign against Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana.</p>
        <p>But as the new presidential season approaches, Ms. Brazile has spurned overtures from most of the Democratic candidates and opted out of the 2004 primaries. For the first time in her two decades in politics, she has hung out a shingle as a consultant who wants to be paid as well as other top Democratic strategists for her advice.</p>
        <p>These days she pointedly calls herself a ''totally independent Democrat.'' And she is not defensive about her chattiness with Republicans.</p>
        <p>''I call Republicans because I can talk outside the box with them,'' she said. ''I can talk with Democrats, but when I talk with Republicans, I learn a lot more.''</p>
        <p>Of course, having a relationship with Mr. Bush's political adviser just might add to Ms. Brazile's cachet as she sets up her own business. She insists, however, that she is motivated to exchange ideas because her party is sputtering while the Republicans are successfully organizing, registering voters, delivering a cohesive message and winning elections.</p>
        <p>Citing Democratic Party figures, she said her party was more preoccupied with appealing to white men, 37 percent of whom vote Democratic, than to black women, 95 percent of whom vote Democratic. And yet, she said, the party counts on black women to show up on Election Day.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brazile's frustration has led her to advocate a political strategy that some in her party view as heresy. She is encouraging black office-holders to run as ''favorite son or favorite daughter'' delegates to the 2004 Democratic Convention without committing themselves in advance to a particular presidential candidate.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to re-energize the African-American electorate and revive the Democratic Party at the same time,'' she said. ''I want to revitalize the party from the grass roots up. We're losing voters.''</p>
        <p>She said she was inspired by the Republicans, whose methodical ''72 hour'' turn-out campaign paid off handsomely in 2002, and who are starting a major voter-registration drive for 2004.</p>
        <p>She also said she believed that through her relationships with Republicans she might be able to broaden their thinking.</p>
        <p>''The Republicans are in charge,'' she said. ''I don't want African-Americans to wait four years or eight years for the Democrats to get back in the game before we make progress.''</p>
        <p>Not that she has any intention of hopping the political fence. The third of nine children in a poor Louisiana family, Ms. Brazile said she believed that government was obligated to ''take care of the least of these.'' She said she could never become a Republican, even as she expressed increasing frustration with Democratic orthodoxy, because of her fundamental disagreement with them over the purpose of government.</p>
        <p>Moreover, she wants to represent Washington in Congress when her friend Eleanor Holmes Norton retires from the nonvoting delegate's seat, and it would be hard to be elected here if she were not a Democrat.</p>
        <p>But she likes the Republicans' company. While Ms. Brazile and Bay Buchanan, the conservative commentator who managed her brother Pat's presidential campaigns, square off every week on CNN's ''Inside Politics,'' they privately break bread together.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norquist said he and Ms. Brazile, both Washington residents, were devising a plan to urge Congress to allow the city to raise the height limit on buildings as a way to broaden the tax base and improve schools.</p>
        <p>''It's probably worth millions in tax dollars to the city,'' Mr. Norquist said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rove, Ms. Buchanan and Mr. Norquist all said they appreciated Ms. Brazile's candor, although her mouth has gotten her in trouble before, as when she said Colin L. Powell was a ''token'' black for the Republicans and when she had to resign from the Dukakis campaign.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Brazile's new friendships seem like a risky venture, few Democrats seem to hold them against her.</p>
        <p>''The No. 1 rule in politics,'' said Bob Mulholland, a campaign adviser to the California Democratic Party, ''is to get into your opponent's living room because you might hear something that will be helpful down the road.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Brazile has angered some black Democrats who say they believe her ''favorite son'' delegate strategy is really intended to stop the candidacy of the Rev. Al Sharpton by keeping black delegates from committing to him.</p>
        <p>Ron Walters, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, said some black Democrats believed Ms. Brazile was trying to stop Mr. Sharpton's candidacy for fear that it could bring to the surface a simmering debate among blacks about the direction of the party.</p>
        <p>''The African-American community is beginning to raise questions about the rightward drift of the party, starting with the crime bill, with welfare reform, and about being taken for granted,'' Mr. Walters said. ''That's a debate the Democratic Party has not wanted to have.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Walters also suggested that because the delegate idea had not taken hold, Ms. Brazile had encouraged former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, a black Democrat, to run for president to dilute support for Mr. Sharpton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharpton dismissed the favorite-son idea as a pointless proposition cooked up by someone he dismissed as ''a political strategist, not a political leader.''</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen any support for it, nor do I see how it would do what she says it's supposed to do, which is to increase turnout and inspire voters,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He declined to speculate on Ms. Brazile's motives but suggested she was part of an old guard that was ''threatened by a new generation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Brazile acknowledged differences with Mr. Sharpton but said she had devised her delegate strategy before he entered the race. She was vague about how much she had encouraged Ms. Moseley-Braun to run. Mostly, she said, she wanted to prod the party to build an internal structure -- for fund-raising, supporting local candidates and getting out the vote -- to win elections.</p>
        <p>''Maybe 'favorite sons' won't work,'' she said, ''but it's better than doing nothing. I don't know what else to do. I'm talking to everyone because I am open.''</p>
        <p>That means being open to Republicans, she said.</p>
        <p>The Republicans, who have been trying to broaden their party's base, say they have something to learn from Ms. Brazile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norquist, for one, said a public association with Ms. Brazile might help Republicans with what he called the party's ''tonal'' problem on racial matters.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Buchanan said, ''When I talk to her, I'm trying to learn something.''</p>
        <p>She added: ''I don't know the inner city, I don't have that experience. I think Karl Rove does the same thing. Here's somebody who he can get information from, and it's not the tired old party line.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Rove wrote a thank-you note to Ms. Brazile in December for doing a favor for a friend, he invited her to lunch at the White House. Tantalizing her with the mischief they could make by being seen together, he wrote, ''We'll really cause heads to turn and tongues to wag.''</p>
        <p>And what would Mr. Rove's boss say about consorting with the enemy?</p>
        <p>''She made some generous comments after 9/11 that he deeply appreciated,'' Mr. Rove said. ''She is, first of all, a great American before she's a partisan, and she isn't stuck in the 2000 election.''</p>
