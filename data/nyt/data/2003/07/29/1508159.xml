We are honored and proud to have been touched by the legend that will always be Bob Hope. Alan King, Abbot Freddie Roman, Dean Jean-Pierre Trebot, Exec Dir</p>
        <p>HOPE--Bob. Fight for Sight was honored to be one of Bob Hope's continuing major interests.

Until the late '90s, he served as Master of Ceremonies at 25 ''Lights On'' benefits in New York City raising funds for research to prevent blindness. The Board of Directors and volunteers offer sympathies to his wife Dolores, and family, and extend our thanks for sharing this incredible man with us for such great good. Kenneth R.
