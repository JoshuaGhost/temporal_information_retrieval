        <p>When the Iraq Museum put the treasures of Nimrud on display earlier this month, it was heralded by many as a sign -- one of the few -- that the coalition authority could restore order in Iraq. Maybe, but things are never that simple.</p>
        <p>A little history first. I learned about the treasure in 1993 while filming a documentary about ancient Mesopotamia. By then, this golden hoard of jewelry -- the burial riches of Assyrian queens -- had already disappeared from the national museum. Rumor was that it had been melted down in the face of sanctions or that Saddam Hussein had given it to a mistress.</p>
        <p>It was only in the late 1990's that I found out what had really happened: the treasure had been transferred to a vault in the Central Bank of Iraq immediately after Mr. Hussein's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
        <p>In May, just after coalition forces had taken Baghdad, I returned to the city with my National Geographic camera crew to search for the treasure. I assumed that it was still beneath the bank. I assumed, too, that it was safe. And then I got into town. The bank building was a burned-out shell. Access to the ruin was tightly controlled by the United States military. Soldiers refused everyone entry.</p>
        <p>At the time, news reports were highlighting the looting of Iraq's treasures, and the coalition was under pressure to find missing artifacts. For this reason, we approached the American team investigating the ransacking of the Iraq Museum. The investigators, who didn't have the benefit of my own ten-year quest for the treasure, weren't aware of it. (The Iraqis seemed in no hurry to enlighten them either.) Once they learned about it, they became as keen to ensure its safety as we were. We were cleared to enter the bank.</p>
        <p>This, however, was no easy task. It appeared as if the bank had taken a direct hit during the war. Charred Iraqi dinars were scattered on the ground like autumn leaves. Twisted metal blocked the stairwells. Picking our way through the debris, we and the investigators headed for the vaults. But instead of just the massive steel safes we'd been expecting, we encountered another formidable barrier: a flood. It was impossible to tell where the water was coming from, or how to turn it off.</p>
        <p>Needless to say, the vaults didn't house just the treasures of Nimrud, they also contained billions of dinars and millions upon millions of American dollars. Still, the Office of the Coalition Provisional Authority -- then under the leadership of Jay Garner -- did not seem to be doing anything to stop the flooding, though it was certainly aware of the situation. (I ran into an Army Corps of Engineers officer checking out the flood, but he told me that he was just sightseeing.) All this was taking place at a time when people weren't getting paid because there weren't enough dinars in circulation.</p>
        <p>Enter enlightened self-interest. My crew and I wanted to film the treasure. So we volunteered to pump out the bank. Though officials at the authority objected, we received approval from Col. Matt Bogdanos, who was coordinating the museum investigation. We hired a crew of Iraqi workers and the water level began to drop.</p>
        <p>In the third week of pumping, however, we hit a snag. Officials at the authority, who had always taken a dim view of our exercise in amateur hydraulics, ordered the bank to replace our workers with an Iraqi crew chosen by them. It quickly became clear that the replacement workers were wildly inefficient -- so inefficient that the bank insisted that our workers finish the job. This time, the authority did not object. Approximately 650,000 gallons of water later, officials opened the vaults, revealing more than 40 billion (soggy) dinars -- and the treasure.</p>
