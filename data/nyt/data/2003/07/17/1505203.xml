        <p>The eyes of the golf world were on Annika Sorenstam two months ago when she became the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event in 58 years. Next week, the focus will be on Suzy Whaley, who will play in the Greater Hartford Open and join Sorenstam and Babe Didrikson Zaharias as the only women to have competed in a PGA Tour event.</p>
        <p>Whaley, 36, earned a spot in the Greater Hartford Open by winning the Connecticut section P.G.A. championship in September. She was one of two women in the field of 90 and won by two shots at the Ellington Ridge Country Club.</p>
        <p>Whaley, of Farmington, Conn., finished at five-under-par 211 after playing the 6,214-yard course off women's tees that reduced the length of the course by 10 percent. To prepare for competing with the men-- and playing from the men's tees this time -- she has followed Sorenstam's example and undergone extensive training to gain strength and add some length to her game.</p>
        <p>Whaley said she had also prepared for the pressure of competing with men.</p>
        <p>''I'm ready to go,'' she said today, the day before the Big Apple Classic at Wykagyl Country Club; she received a sponsor's exemption to compete in the L.P.G.A. event this week. ''I was ready to go last week.''</p>
        <p>Whaley played on the L.P.G.A. Tour for two years a decade ago but did not fare well. In 1993, for example, she made the cut twice in 13 tournaments, and her best finish was a tie for 72nd. She played the L.P.G.A. event here twice, with little success.</p>
        <p>Based on her play this year, Whaley is not expected to do well this time, either, even though only 3 of the top 10 women on the L.P.G.A. Tour are participating. Sorenstam heads the list of absentees.</p>
        <p>Whaley has played in only three L.P.G.A. events this season and made the cut once, at the Giant Eagle L.P.G.A. Classic last month in Vienna, Ohio. She finished tied for 50th with a one-over-par 271 at the Squaw Creek Country Club, a 6,446-yard course. That is 386 yards shorter than the T.P.C. at River Highlands, where she will play next week in the Greater Hartford Open.</p>
        <p>The length of the course matters more to Whaley than to the men. She is a relatively short hitter and will probably have to use woods to hit onto the greens on the five par-4's that measure more than 440 yards.</p>
        <p>''I have plans for every hole,'' Whaley said about her strategy for next week. ''If the course is dry and I catch a break here and there, I'll have a shorter shot to the greens. The perfect scenario will be to leave me with shorter irons to the green.''</p>
        <p>Whaley said today that she had nothing to prove to anyone next week, but that she was playing to test herself. Whaley said what she would try to take from Sorenstam's experience was her attitude on the course. Sorenstam was not flustered, even though she missed the cut.</p>
        <p>''I liked how she handled herself, her composure,'' Whaley said. ''The job she did was tremendous. For me to come close to how she played and how she behaved, it would be huge.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Sybase announced that it had extended its sponsorship of the tournament for three more years, with an option for more. Next year, the event will be played two months earlier, it will increase its purse to $1.25 million from $950,000 and it will be called the Sybase Classic. L.P.G.A. Commissioner TY VOTAW and JOHN CHEN, the Sybase chairman, said the tournament would still be staged at Wykagyl, where it has been played since 1990.</p>
