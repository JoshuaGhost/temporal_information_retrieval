        <p>Information Resources, known as IRI, hired William Blair &amp; Company in February to explore its options, two months after its largest client, Procter &amp; Gamble, gave notice that it was shifting its business to ACNielsen. Also in February, an investor called for IRI to put itself up for sale or fire the chairman and chief executive, Joseph P. Durrett.</p>
        <p>The tender offer, expected to begin by July 14, was higher than the stock's closing price on Friday of $2.98 a share. The shares closed yesterday at $3.93, up 31.9 percent.</p>
