        <p>President Bush dropped by a senior citizens' center in Miami's Little Havana section today to try to capitalize on his plan to overhaul Medicare, then scooped up $3 million more for his re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>At three speedy campaignlike stops, two in Miami and one in a hotel ballroom here, Mr. Bush reached out to two voting blocs that will be critical to his success in a state that he won by only 537 votes in the 2000 election: Hispanics and the elderly.</p>
        <p>''Siéntese, por favor,'' Mr. Bush said at the Little Havana Activities and Nutrition Center, using Spanish to urge the applauding crowd to sit down. ''Muchas gracias. I'm honored to be here. Thank you for letting me come by to talk about a subject that is, I know, important to many, and that is the opportunities and the chances of modernizing Medicare.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, speaking alongside a made-for-television poster that said ''Mejorando Medicare,'' the Spanish-language version of a poster directly behind him that said ''Strengthening Medicare,'' declared that it was essential to add a prescription drug benefit to the popular health plan for the elderly, as both the Senate and the House voted to do in differing bills late last week. But the president did not say whether he liked one bill more than the other. Republicans say that at this point, he is less interested in the details of coming negotiations between the two houses than in simply getting a Medicare bill enacted to wield in his re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>''The Senate had one version, the House of Representatives had another, but there's a lot of commonality between them,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And I'm confident that the members, when they get back from their Fourth of July breaks, will get to work, iron out the differences in a constructive way and get a good bill to my desk, so that I can then say, and all of us can say, 'We've done our jobs on behalf of America's seniors.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's next stop was a $2,000-a-plate lunch at the Miami Airport Hilton, where the take for his campaign was $1.8 million. The president then boarded Air Force One and zoomed northward, where he picked up $1.2 million at a cocktail reception at the Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay. Vice President Dick Cheney, meanwhile, collected $500,000 today in Grand Rapids, Mich., and $600,000 in Akron, Ohio, bringing the campaign's total to date to more than $21 million.</p>
        <p>Nicolle Devenish, the Bush-Cheney 2004 spokeswoman, said she expected the campaign to reach its goal of $30 million by the close of the day, the end of the second quarter, with the extra millions coming from online contributions and direct mail. But she said that the campaign was still counting and that she did not yet have a precise figure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush appeared in both Miami and Tampa with his younger, taller brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, an occasion for favorite Bush family jokes on the part of the president, and more chances for him to sprinkle his remarks with crowd-pleasing Spanglish. In Little Havana, he referred to Jeb as ''mi grande hermanito'' -- my big little brother -- and then in Tampa said that ''he and I share the same political consultant, our mother; she doesn't charge very much for her advice, but she gives plenty of it.''</p>
        <p>Despite the tidy, lock-step nature of another Bush White House-organized day, there were a few slip-ups. In Little Havana, Mr. Bush got tangled up in his remarks, confusing the independent mayor of Miami, Manny Diaz, who was in the crowd, with the Democratic mayor of Miami-Dade County, Alex Panelas, who was not.</p>
        <p>''We've got el alcalde de Miami,'' Mr. Bush said, using the Spanish for mayor. ''Thank you, señor. Thank you very much, Alex, for coming -- I mean, Manny, for coming.</p>
        <p>''And Alex Panelas is here as well, the mayor of -- donde?'' Mr. Bush said, using the Spanish word for where. When it became clear that Mr. Panelas was not in the crowd, Mr. Bush said, laughing: ''O.K. At least he got his name mentioned. That's a smart move.''</p>
        <p>Among the crowd at the Miami fund-raiser was Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the 4-foot-7 sex therapist, a Democrat who said she had not contributed $2,000 to the president's re-election campaign but was there as a guest of paying friends. Nonetheless, she said she supported the president. She also had her picture taken with Mr. Bush, who knelt next to her, bringing his head level with her chest.</p>
        <p>''The president of these United States on his knees, taking his picture with me,'' Dr. Ruth said, pleased.</p>
