        <p>On ''The Restaurant,'' a reality show about a celebrity chef struggling to open his own place in Manhattan, Rocco DiSpirito spends a lot more time in his car than in his kitchen.</p>
        <p>We see Mr. DiSpirito drive his Mitsubishi S.U.V. to his mother's house in Jamaica, Queens. We watch him argue with his publicist while refueling it at a gas station. The camera does not linger on the penne or Mama's meatballs, but we witness his S.U.V. being towed from in front of his restaurant, Rocco's on 22nd Street.</p>
        <p>''The Restaurant,'' which begins tomorrow night on NBC, works on two levels. It is an enjoyable, artificially enhanced reality show, a ''Real World'' for foodies. It also provides a valuable lesson in television economics. Because so many reality shows have lost their novelty and viewers, networks are passing the costs on to sponsors, who use such shows for product placement. NBC calls this kind of reality show ''unscripted drama.'' The scripted part lies in writing advertising artfully into the plot.</p>
        <p>Coors beer is the oddest sponsor fit of the three. Few Italian menus offer things like agnolotti alla birra, and Coors is not the brand of choice of many downtown sophisticates. Mostly we see crates of Coors beer being loaded into the kitchen storerooms as the carpenters work frantically to put down the floors and erect new walls before the deadline. (Sometimes the show looks a little like ''Trading Spaces.'')</p>
        <p>Like Mitsubishi, American Express is an easier fit. The logo is on the ''open/closed'' sign on the restaurant door, and the filmmakers make the most of a scene on the ''soft'' opening night, when family and friends were fed free in a dress rehearsal of fine dining. One of the harried new waiters, Gideon Horowitz (he got his job by showing up early for auditions and camping out on the curb with a sign that read ''I am not a bum; I am first in line''), informs a customer that there is no more red wine. The customer is appalled. ''How can you not have red wine?'' he asks, pulling out his American Express card and imperiously instructing the waiter to take it next door and buy four more bottles. (The waiter fails, perhaps because American Express does not want viewers to come away with the idea that it is that easy to use a stranger's card.)</p>
        <p>Mr. DiSpirito is a natural reality-show hero: attractive and engaging on camera and an established sex symbol, who has made the list of People magazine's sexiest men. Like the Carrie Bradshaw character on HBO's ''Sex in the City,'' he narrates each episode in a first-person off-camera monologue, ''I'm one of those fancy New York chefs.''</p>
        <p>He takes the viewer on a tour of his grandmother's tiny red-brick house in Jamaica (actually it is more of a Mitsubishi drive-by) and rather touchingly says that each family meal in the basement there ''was like being in Italy.'' He says his vision is to recreate that cramped, homey spirit in a vast empty space vacated by a bankruptcy proceeding on the corner of Mercer and Prince Streets in SoHo.</p>
        <p>Luckily, reality intervenes. Perhaps because no valet is a hero to his master, his financial backer, Jeffery Chodorow, alone seems unmoved by Mr. DiSpirito's charm and enthusiasm. ''Rocco, at this point it is not about how much you love the space,'' Mr. Chodorow, who speaks with the flat, dyspeptic tones of the actor Ben (''Anyone?'') Stein, tells him. ''It's really not worth the legal problems so let's talk later, O.K.?'' He folds himself into his limousine and drives away. Mr. DiSpirito eventually resigns himself to another vacant space in the Flatiron district.</p>
        <p>Viewers get a slight taste of downtown flash and dash, but the reality of the restaurant world remains hidden. (Mr. Chodorow and Mr. DiSpirito hope the show will make the restaurant a hit, even if ratings are disappointing.) From George Orwell's descriptions of life as a ''plongeur'' while down and out in Paris to Anthony Bourdain's expos√© of gourmet squalor in ''Kitchen Confidential,'' readers hold few illusions about kitchen hygiene and high jinks. NBC viewers' eyes are kept trained on the front of the room -- the flubs, rivalries and romances of the waiting staff and the caprices of customers.</p>
        <p>So there is not much insight into the fine art of cooking. We see Mr. DiSpirito flag a little between spritely media appearances. We watch him worry and occasionally lose his patience. But we do not see him prepare food much -- unless one counts an appearance on a local radio station, where the hosts challenge him to concoct a dish from ingredients in the vending machine (he gamely whips up a dessert from candy, coffee and nuts mixed in a blender).</p>
        <p>In fact it is not until midway through opening night that viewers have any sense at all of why this engaging young man greeting guests out front is wearing a crisp white chef's jacket.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, clam orders begin to pile up, a grease fire ignites over the stove, and Mr. DiSpirito hurtles downstairs and snarls obscenities at his sous chefs, shouts at the waiters and hurls plates around. At last, a chef who knows his way around a restaurant kitchen.</p>
        <p>THE RESTAURANT  NBC, tomorrow night at 10, Eastern and Pacific times; 9, Central time.</p>
