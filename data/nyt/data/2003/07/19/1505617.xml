        <p>Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston has been diagnosed with a rare, treatable type of cancer and will have surgery to remove the malignant growth on Monday, doctors said. The small tissue sarcoma is slow-growing and rarely resurfaces or spreads. Mayor Menino's doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, where the surgery is to take place, said the mayor should be cancer-free after the one-inch lump is removed. Part of the tumor was removed in a biopsy on July 3.</p>
