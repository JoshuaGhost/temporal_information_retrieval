      <block class="full_text">
        <p>He says there is no proof of a plot to snatch the United States Olympic Committee's headquarters from Colorado Springs. But Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado is certain that ''people in Olympic circles in New York'' want to steal away with some part of the dysfunctional organization.</p>
        <p>''I'm convinced,'' he said yesterday from Washington. ''I can't elaborate. Some people are wearing two hats.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''It's not my responsibility to get to the bottom of this. It's my job to preserve the U.S.O.C. for Colorado Springs.''</p>
        <p>Jay Kriegel, executive director of NYC2012, who is a central member of Olympic circles in New York, declined to comment.</p>
        <p>Campbell has attacked the Olympic committee for its chaotic, self-interested, profligate ways and has helped lead the drive for reform. But his role has been ad hoc. He was invited to help the fix-the-U.S.O.C. effort by the Senate Commerce Committee, and he has done so with relish: a 1964 judo Olympian, Campbell has been feistier than his Senate Republican colleagues John McCain of Arizona and Ted Stevens of Alaska.</p>
        <p>Just as McCain's reform bill was introduced last week, Campbell blocked it with a procedural hold and vowed to relent only when he gets what he wants: legislative protection that no part of the U.S.O.C.'s Colorado Springs complex will go anywhere, neither its executive offices nor its training center.</p>
        <p>But the Commerce Committee is resistant to make policy over office location, being eager as it is to legislate the size of a new board (to nine elected directors) and the creation of an assembly, which would be made up of nearly all of the 124 members of the nearly extinct U.S.O.C. board.</p>
        <p>''I want more than reasonable assurance that it won't move,'' Campbell said, allowing only that he would not mind New York's having a ''satellite office.''</p>
        <p>Campbell said he and McCain had not formally met on any compromise language in the bill that ''will satisfy Colorado Springs and me.'' He said he would not support language that would let a supermajority, or 60 percent, of the proposed assembly decide on any move.</p>
        <p>''I want specific language,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whatever threat is perceived by Campbell has not been apparent in the debate over how to alter the course of the floundering, bloated Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>Recent reports on reforming the U.S.O.C. -- one by an internal task force, the other by an external, independent commission of five members, four of them from the New York area -- made no mention of moving the headquarters.</p>
        <p>''I don't know where this is coming from,'' Harvey Schiller, a member of the commission, said yesterday from France.</p>
        <p>Donna de Varona, also a commission member, said of Campbell: ''He's running for re-election. There are politics other than Olympic politics. It's really unfortunate. It's a tragedy that it has to be an Olympian.''</p>
        <p>Only one U.S.O.C. board member, Anita DeFrantz, said in Senate testimony earlier this year that the organization's main offices, not its training center, should be moved to a major city. ''I've said that it would be important to have the executive offices -- and this is other people's opinions, too -- in a major metropolitan area,'' DeFrantz said yesterday from Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>De Varona said the benefits of such a move would be in recruiting executive talent and in marketing. But the commission did not deal with the idea.</p>
        <p>Campbell called it fallacious to believe that Olympic sponsors would prefer visiting New York, where some of them are located, over Colorado Springs. In travelogue style, he asked, ''Do people want to stay in the sweltering concrete canyons of New York or visit the beautiful mountains and real canyons of Colorado Springs?''</p>
        <p>The senator's initiative has led Mayor Lionel Rivera of Colorado Springs to start a letter-writing campaign to Congress (to help save what would be lost of the $315 million local sports economy if U.S.O.C. jobs flee), and prompted a coalition of business groups to hire a Capitol Hill lobbyist.</p>
        <p>Rocky Scott, president of the Greater Colorado Springs Economic Development Corporation, said he was unfazed that Campbell's evidence of a plot is slender because the U.S.O.C.'s ethical house of cards made what is denied look believable.</p>
        <p>''How long have you tracked the U.S.O.C.?'' Scott said. ''There are more subplots there than a 'Hill Street Blues' episode. The things people say may communicate less than what they don't say. There are denials, half-denials, and you can get any answer you want depending on the level of confidentiality.''</p>
        <p>Although Campbell is wary of ''covetous eyes'' that he said New York had cast upon the U.S.O.C. and its assets, he held a fund-raiser last week that included former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''I see no irony in that at all,'' Campbell said.</p>
