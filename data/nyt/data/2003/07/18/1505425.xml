        <p>Almost on cue, the British Open began and the wind began to howl.</p>
        <p>Royal St. George's is a nasty golf course, even without an assist from nature.</p>
        <p>But today, winds gusting to 35 miles an hour created some crazy situations. Tiger Woods lost his ball on his first tee shot and shot a 7. Jerry Kelly made an 11 on the first hole. Thomas Bjorn, after failing to escape a bunker on his first attempt at No. 17, slammed his club into the sand, incurring a two-stroke penalty. And Kenny Perry, playing his first British Open since 1991, was quickly reminded of what he had been missing.</p>
        <p>''I hit a 5-iron that went 100 yards,'' Perry said. ''It went straight up in the air. I couldn't believe it.''</p>
        <p>Other things were harder to believe. Hennie Otto, a 27-year-old South African who qualified on Monday, was leading the tournament after shooting a three-under-par 68. And Greg Norman, at age 48, having played only two tournaments in 2003, was one stroke off the lead.</p>
        <p>''When I came over here, I came under the radar screen, because my expectations weren't that high,'' said Norman, who won the last British Open played at St. George's, in 1993. ''But my desires inside were high. Because links golf excites me.''</p>
        <p>The excitement had only begun. Otto led by one stroke over Norman and Davis Love III heading into the second round on Friday. S.K. Ho and Fredrik Jacobson, at 70, were the only other players under par on a blustery day that punished anyone who did not bring his best game.</p>
        <p>Woods, who shot an adventurous 73 that started with a triple bogey, was five strokes off the lead, but Ernie Els, the defending champion, struggled to a 78, playing in the afternoon when the wind was at its mightiest. Jacobson was the only player in the 156-player field with a bogey-free round.</p>
        <p>Forgive yourself if you have never heard of the leader. Otto, who is playing his first British Open, has never won a professional event and does not even have a top-10 finish on the European Tour this year. But with so many odd things happening all over the course, maybe an unexpected leader should have been expected.</p>
        <p>Did Otto really believe he could hold off players like Love, Norman and so many others?</p>
        <p>''I hope so,'' Otto said. ''Give it to me now. I'll take it.''</p>
        <p>It will not be that easy, not with 54 holes to play. The conditions today were almost cruel. For three days, players had practiced in balmy weather, with moderate winds and afternoon temperatures in the 80's. Then overnight, everything changed. The wind came and, for the players, the nightmares began.</p>
        <p>How tough were the conditions? The threesome of Els, David Toms (80) and Shigeki Maruyama (83), three of the world's top players, did not make one birdie.</p>
        <p>''The winds were gusting, and it doesn't help when you're 6-foot-3,'' Els said. ''If I want to get back into the tournament, I'm going to have to do something special. But if it stays like this, even par might win the tournament.''</p>
        <p>Colin Montgomerie could not even reach the golf course without encountering trouble. Surprised by rain that was falling this morning, Montgomerie tripped outside his hotel, broke his fall with his right hand and was forced to withdraw after seven holes because of the hand injury.</p>
        <p>''I came out of my hotel, I couldn't believe it was raining, and I looked up and missed the first step and fell nastily,'' said Montgomerie, a 40-year-old Scot who was hoping to win his first major. ''I am going home to have it X-rayed.''</p>
        <p>Otto enjoyed far better luck. He was in the day's first threesome, teeing off at 6:30 a.m. Though Otto had to wake up at 4 a.m., it was worth it. That was the best way to play St. George's today -- get in, get out and give thanks if you finished with your pride intact.</p>
        <p>''I think I got the best draw,'' said Otto, who will have to play in the afternoon on Friday.</p>
        <p>Otto had five birdies and two bogeys, and he avoided the big numbers that plagued so many others. St. George's never let up, from start to finish. Twelve players made double bogey or worse at No. 1. On the two finishing holes, the par-4, 428-yard No. 17 played into a crosswind and the par-4, 460-yard No. 18 played into the wind. Both were particularly brutal.</p>
        <p>The difference between how the course played during practice rounds and today was dramatic. At the par-5, 550-yard No. 14 during practice, Phil Mickelson hit a driver and a 6-iron and reached the green. Today, with No. 14 playing into the wind, he needed a driver, a 3-wood and a 6-iron to reach the green.</p>
        <p>Many holes played into a crosswind, making it even more difficult for players to pick a target line. Keeping the ball in the mounded fairways is always difficult. With the wind, the fairways looked narrower than some European streets.</p>
        <p>''You couldn't land an airplane in some of these crosswinds,'' said Mickelson, who was once three under par but finished with a three-over-par 74. ''It would tip over.''</p>
        <p>But Norman relied on his experience at St. George's and was rewarded. He shot a final-round 64 when he won here in 1993. Knowing the winds, the fairways, the greens and the nuances of the course gave him an edge, and he hit the ball solidly enough to take advantage. Norman was four under par through 13 holes, and had he avoided a bogey on No. 18, he would have shared the first-round lead. Still, he was satisfied.</p>
        <p>''The golf course was there, baring her teeth all the way around,'' said Norman, who also won the British Open in 1986 at Turnberry. ''If you haven't played this golf course before, it really crosses you up. You're aiming sometimes 40 yards left of the fairway. And it's hard sometimes to aim that far left, or that far right, and trust it. Then you've got to hope the ball lands on a flat part of the fairway and kicks straight. It's tough on your head, all the way around.''</p>
        <p>And with three rounds to play, the headaches have just begun.</p>
