        <p>Directed by Danny Provenzano  Not rated, 100 minutes</p>
        <p>The book has yet to be written that explains America's enduring fascination with the mythology of the Mafia, from ''The Godfather'' to ''The Sopranos.'' But when it is, ''This Thing of Ours'' will merit at least a footnote.</p>
        <p>A loosely knit collection of anecdotes centered on the earnest attempts of the young hoodlum Nicholas Santini to earn his ''button'' as a full-fledged member of the governing counsel of a New Jersey-based Cosa Nostra chapter, ''This Thing of Ours'' has a claim to authenticity that most gang movies do not.</p>
        <p>Santini is played by the film's director and co-writer, Danny Provenzano, a grandnephew of the Teamster official Anthony Provenzano, known as Tony Pro. Danny Provenzano is scheduled to begin a prison term in New Jersey next month, after pleading guilty to charges of racketeering and tax evasion in connection with his printing business.</p>
        <p>But the grain of experience is not often to be felt in ''This Thing of Ours,'' which is populated with familiar faces from the genre, including James Caan of ''The Godfather'' and Frank Vincent and Vincent Pastore of ''The Sopranos.'' For all of his personal familiarity with the material, Mr. Provenzano has turned out a movie that largely owes its tone and style to other movies.</p>
        <p>As in Martin Scorsese's 1990 ''GoodFellas'' (which also featured Mr. Vincent and Mr. Pastore), the young hero tries to impress his elders, including his influential Uncle Danny (Mr. Vincent), with a spectacular robbery. No longer content to plunder tractor trailers on New Jersey highways, Nick conspires with a computer genius from the old neighborhood in Brooklyn to plant a modified computer chip on a communications satellite that will somehow allow him to siphon off spare change from several million bank accounts. Fidel Castro, we are told, has offered to harbor the stolen money in Cuban banks, for a small fee.</p>
        <p>This may sound more like James Bond than John Gotti, but by the end of the film we are back in familiar territory, as Nick is forced to choose between loyalty to his friends and a promotion in the organization. It is, as Al Pacino discovered in ''Godfather II,'' lonely at the top.</p>
        <p>Most of the fun in ''This Thing of Ours,'' which opens today in New York City and New Jersey, lies in watching the veteran actors do their shtick, sitting around big tables and telling outrageous stories seasoned by undoubtedly authentic neighborhood accents. These sequences, and there are many of them, feel like the most personal moments in the film: it is not hard to image Mr. Provenzano as a child, excitedly eavesdropping on his elders' table talk, and dreaming of someday joining them. Maybe that's the movie Mr. Provenzano should make when he gets out of prison. He'll have time to polish the script.</p>
