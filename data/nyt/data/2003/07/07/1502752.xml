        <p>The steep falloff in viewers for "American Juniors" indicates Fox may be overexposing the "American Idol" franchise.</p>
      </block>
      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The host is the same. The contestants are singing many of the same songs. The show's name is even designed to make viewers think of the original.</p>
        <p>But try as Fox might, the show in question, ''American Juniors,'' is not being ''Idolized.''</p>
        <p>Five weeks into its summer run on the Fox network, ''American Juniors,'' the talent show for the prepubescent set, is looking like a pint-sized imitation of ''American Idol,'' the show that inspired the format and has shared its host, Ryan Seacrest.</p>
        <p>''American Juniors'' has lost nearly 40 percent of its audience from its first showing, and its viewership has declined each week -- except for a small uptick when an ''American Idol'' runner-up, Justin Guarini, made an appearance. Last week, the show, which is from the same production team responsible for ''American Idol,'' was the lowest rated of four reality series on Tuesday night, losing its time period to ''Dog Eat Dog'' on NBC.</p>
        <p>The repercussions for Fox could be significant. The network has already scheduled a second edition of ''American Juniors'' for its fall prime-time schedule, which could leave Fox vulnerable in the Tuesday 8 p.m. time slot. But more important is the possible damage the ''American Idol'' spinoff might inflict on the original, the big hit of last summer and winter, which will be returning midseason for Fox.</p>
        <p>Some of Fox's competitors, overcome by boldness -- or wishful thinking -- have begun to question if Fox is making the same mistake ABC did several years with ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' by oversaturating the prime-time lineup and diluting the long-term appeal of the format.</p>
        <p>Jeff Zucker, the president of NBC Entertainment, said: ''American Juniors will not be on the fall Fox schedule. We've been saying this for a few weeks now.'' He partially defended the show's performance, noting that summer shows that start at the early hour of 8 p.m. always have trouble building audiences; ''American Idol,'' for example, played at 9 p.m. last summer. But he added, ''Having said that, the track on Junior Idol is bad.'' He also noted that NBC had no intention of bringing back for the regular season ''Dog Eat Dog,'' the reality show ''American Juniors'' was now trailing.</p>
        <p>''American Juniors'' is actually the second less-than-stellar attempt by Fox and its parent, News Corporation, to go to market with a spinoff of the ''American Idol'' powerhouse. The first, a 20th Century Fox film, ''From Justin to Kelly,'' starring the finalists from the first ''Idol'' contest, Mr. Guarini and the winner, Kelly Clarkson, was one of the loudest flops of the summer. (The CD's from the ''American Idol'' contestants have sold extremely well, but News Corporation does not share in those profits.)</p>
        <p>Fox executives said they were not concerned by the performance of ''American Juniors'' or the impact it might have on the original. ''I think once again expectations were exaggerated by others,'' said Preston Beckman, executive vice president of program planning for Fox. ''The show is performing well. It is very salable and we're making money on it.'' He would not specify how much the network is making on the show.</p>
        <p>He also scoffed at any suggestion that the value of ''American Idol'' might be diminished. ''We're not hurting ourselves with 'Juniors,' '' he said. ''And we're not damaging the franchise whatsoever. 'American Idol' will come back stronger than ever. I think the viewers are a lot smarter than our competitors.''</p>
        <p>The difference between the two shows, he said, came down to scale and size, literally. ''This is Little League,'' he said. ''You're still watching a good game, but you don't get the kind of crowd you get at Yankee Stadium.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beckman said that Fox, at least at this moment, has every intention of keeping ''American Juniors'' on its fall schedule, though he noted, ''We have contingencies on top of contingencies.''</p>
        <p>The middling ratings for ''American Juniors'' underscore how much weaker the reality genre has become so far this summer after four consecutive summers of generating shows that became hits in the regular season. None of Fox's other significant reality programs -- ''Paradise Hotel'' and ''Anything for Love'' -- or those on NBC -- ''For Love of Money'' and ''Dog Eat Dog'' -- has broken through as a bona fide hit, though several have improved their time periods for their networks.</p>
        <p>Only one summer reality series can be called a hit of sorts, ''The Search for America's Next Top Model,'' an elimination contest for would-be professional models. That show has expanded its audience almost every week on UPN, a network that gets little attention; a second edition has already been ordered.</p>
        <p>Michael Davies -- the producer of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the first reality summer blockbuster -- said the shows have simply been too derivative. ''We have a dozen variations on 'The Bachelor' and just as many talent shows,'' he said. Except for ''America's Top Model,'' Mr. Davies said, the shows lack the one essential quality that has defined the big reality successes, like ''Millionaire,'' ''Survivor,'' ''The Bachelor'' and ''American Idol.''</p>
        <p>''All those shows have high stakes,'' he said. ''Whether it's big money or a supposed romantic partner for life or a contract to get into show business. Or in the case of the model show, it's a real shot at a big-time career. Those are high stakes.</p>
        <p>''Each of those shows has a hide-behind-the-couch moment when it is so tense for the real person in the show that you can hardly bear to watch. What kind of stakes can there be for an 11-year-old?''</p>
        <p>The most gripping aspect of ''American Juniors'' might well be the competitive sniping the show's ratings slippage has set off between Fox and the leader it is gaining on, NBC. Mr. Beckman of Fox asserts that the real story of the summer ought to be the decision by NBC ''to rip up its schedule of scripted series'' in favor of reality shows, like ''Dog Eat Dog,'' ''Meet My Folks,'' and an imminent one, ''The Restaurant.''</p>
        <p>''We didn't go totally nutzoid this summer,'' Mr. Beckman said. ''NBC is the network desperately looking for an 800-pound gorilla reality hit because they know the shape they're in.''</p>
        <p>That strategy has backfired, Mr. Beckman said, because the half-dozen shows NBC has programmed so far this summer have yet to produce one that NBC could confidently turn into a regular-season series. (Several more are yet to come.) Mr. Zucker pronounced himself pleased with the results of NBC's programming choices, which gave the network the most reality series this summer. ''Our ratings speak for themselves,'' he said. ''We're up 14 percent over last summer.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Beckman and a senior executive from another network said NBC advertisers have been more resistant to appearing on the shows, especially ''For Love or Money,'' a date-type show with a wrinkle -- once the man winnows the field of competing women to one, she can choose between him and $1 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zucker challenged that view, saying ''For Love or Money,'' which has its finale tonight, was sold out, and to good advertisers. NBC had so much confidence in the show, it produced a second edition even before the first went on the air; the show will return later this summer.</p>
        <p>Referring to Fox's reality lineup this summer, Mr. Zucker said, ''We think someone is trying to divert attention from the failure of 'American Juniors,' 'Anything for Love' and 'Paradise Hotel.' ''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Davies, at least, sees little reason for any network to be taking verbal shots at any other over reality shows right now. He said the overall performance of reality television shows this summer ''only proves reality can produce as many crummy ideas for shows as dramas and comedies.''</p>
