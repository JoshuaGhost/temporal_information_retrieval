        <p>Royal Philips Electronics in Amsterdam has consolidated virtually all its worldwide advertising, with total billings estimated at $600 million, by naming DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, as its sole global agency.</p>
        <p>DDB, which handles assignments for Philips products like consumer electronics and semiconductors as well as corporate image campaigns, now adds the duties for home appliances, personal-care products, lighting systems and medical products. Those duties had been handled by the offices of Leo Burnett Worldwide, part of the Publicis Groupe, which will now work on selected projects for Philips.</p>
        <p>''We're disappointed with Philips's decision to consolidate its brand advertising elsewhere,'' said Julie Thompson, a spokeswoman at Burnett in Chicago. Burnett had inherited its Philips accounts from a sibling, D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, which Publicis closed last year. DDB joined the Philips agency roster in December 2000, when it was awarded assignments that had been handled by offices of Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of Havas. The DDB and Burnett assignments were estimated to have been evenly divided, each handling about $300 million in billings.</p>
