        <p>Monster, the job search Web site operated by Monster Worldwide, has named Deutsch in New York to handle creative duties on its United States account. Until recently, that account had been handled by Arnold Worldwide in Boston.</p>
        <p>Although billings were not disclosed, the Monster job site, which is based in Maynard, Mass., spent $29.5 million to advertise last year in major media, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR. That was down about 50 percent from $58.8 million in 2000, during the dot-com boom, TNS said.</p>

        <p>Although billings were not disclosed, the Monster job site, which is based in Maynard, Mass., spent $29.5 million to advertise last year in major media, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMR. That was down about 50 percent from $58.8 million in 2000, during the dot-com boom, TNS said.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to Deutsch, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and two other New York agencies: DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, part of the Publicis Groupe.</p>
        <p>The review began in April when Monster, formerly Monster.com, unexpectedly parted ways with Arnold, its agency of nearly three years. Arnold's work for Monster included the creation of the theme, ''Never Settle.'' Arnold is part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners division of Havas.</p>
