        <p>Shareholders of the Cordiant Communications Group, the struggling British agency company, approved a buyout by WPP Group at a meeting today, but not before spending several hours criticizing the board. And in an highly unusual show of anger, the shareholders removed the top executives from the board.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, David Hearn, Cordiant's chief executive; Nigel Stapleton, the chairman; and Andrew Boland, the chief financial officer, were removed from the board. The vote is more symbolic than transforming, as WPP, the world's third-largest agency company, takes control in August. But corporate governance experts said the move was very rare.</p>
        <p>The buyout by WPP has been highly contested, particularly by Cordiant's largest shareholder, Active Value Advisors, because it leaves shareholders with just a fraction of what they think the company is worth. Still, just over 99 percent of shareholders voted for the deal, in part because they were left without another choice, many said.</p>
        <p>Cordiant has suffered in recent years after a binge of high-priced acquisitions in the late 1990's and client defections left it with high debt and shrinking profits. Mr. Hearn, already a senior executive at Cordiant, was named chief executive in September, in a move that some investors and analysts had hoped would lead to a turnaround. Mr. Stapleton, a former executive of Reed Elsevier, joined in March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hearn and Mr. Boland will stay on as executives during the transition, while Mr. Stapleton will step down and forgo $321,000 in pay.</p>
        <p>Cordiant said in June that it had agreed to be bought by WPP in a deal that values the company at about £10 million ($16.8 million). WPP also bought Cordiant's bank debt for 100 percent of its face value, and threatened to push the company into bankruptcy if the deal did not go through. Bankruptcy would leave shareholders with nothing, while the WPP deal grants them one WPP share for every 205 Cordiant shares they own, or about 2.5 pence each.</p>
        <p>At the meeting, Cordiant shareholders called the company's demise everything from a mistake to a ''debacle.'' Shareholders said they were upset that the board had not considered alternative proposals, including selling pieces of the company or trying to find cash to recapitalize. At several points during the meeting, Active Value's Brian Myerson and Julian Treger, managers of the fund, berated management for choosing a low bid, and for choosing to delist the company last week. Mr. Myerson and Mr. Treger have bought millions of Cordiant shares recently.</p>
        <p>Just a fraction of the criticism at the three-hour meeting came from the fund managers, though; Cordiant executives also vented their anger. The executives, and a number of the founders of the smaller advertising companies Cordiant bought (often with stock), are watching their worth shrink. ''A lot of us have lost personal fortunes,'' said one executive from Healthworld, an American health marketing company that was purchased by Cordiant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hearn, the chief executive, defended the board's decisions, saying that two studies concluded that breaking up the company would result in ''significantly less money.''</p>
        <p>Shareholders were also incensed that the executives who were voted off the board hold newly arranged contracts that guarantee payouts of about £3 million when the WPP deal is completed. Mr. Myerson and Mr. Treger repeatedly asked the three to surrender those payouts. The executives declined.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, shareholders had their say when they voted 69 percent in favor of ousting the three executives from the board. About 120 million of the 132 million votes cast in favor belong to Active Value. ''A significant majority of the votes cast by shareholders other than Active Value were in favor of retaining the three directors, Active Value's votes for removal were sufficient to pass the resolutions,'' Cordiant said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Shareholders rarely vote out a board member, no matter how angry they are, unless there is a hostile takeover under way and the change is necessary for one side to gain control, said Beth Young, senior researcher for the Corporate Library, an investment research firm. ''It sounds like Cordiant shareholders just wanted to say 'Thanks for nothing' to the people who got them there,'' Ms. Young said.</p>
