        <p>Engineers and planners designing an alteration to or replacement for the Tappan Zee Bridge to ease congestion at one of the region's most notorious bottlenecks have narrowed 156 options down to 15.</p>
        <p>At a meeting yesterday morning in Nyack, officials presented the proposals -- which range from preserving the current bridge to building a six-mile Tappan Zee tunnel -- to about 100 people, including residents and members of community groups who have been following the the study since it began more than a year ago.</p>
        <p>The Tappan Zee Bridge, which is three miles long and connects Nyack, in Rockland County, to Tarrytown, in Westchester, stretches across one of the widest sections of the Hudson River. It was built 48 years ago and was expected to last about 50 years, though officials say it is still safe. Designed to accommodate 100,000 vehicles a day, the bridge now handles 130,000.</p>
        <p>Four of the options presented yesterday include building a tunnel, an option that has gained support among many residents in Rockland and Westchester Counties.</p>
        <p>The 15 options that survived the initial round of screening can be divided into five categories.</p>
        <p>*The preservation of the bridge with routine maintenance.</p>
        <p>*A complete rehabilitation of the bridge to enhance its ability to withstand earthquakes.</p>
        <p>*The construction of a new bridge in the same location that is 50 feet wider than the current one.</p>
        <p>*The construction of a tunnel to handle commuter rail and supplement a new or rehabilitated bridge.</p>
        <p>*The construction of a tunnel to handle both trains and vehicles.</p>
        <p>''Their choices are rather reasonable and rational,'' said J. Jeffrey Anzevino, a regional planner with Scenic Hudson, a nonprofit group that seeks to control suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>Alexander Saunders, a Garrison resident who has been advocating a tunnel extending to Long Island, however, said he was frustrated by what he saw as the team's refusal to consider a plan that goes beyond Westchester and Rockland.</p>
        <p>In the next phase of study, the team of engineers and planners will further winnow the options to about five based on ability to handle traffic, impact on the environment, cost and the demands of the community. Christopher A. Waite, an engineer with New York State Thruway Authority who heads the project team, said he expected to announce the finalists around the beginning of next year.</p>
        <p>''Some options might not work as well,'' Mr. Waite said. ''Some might be too expensive. In the next few months, we'll assess each one of them using computer models.''</p>
        <p>While the project team has received $11.5 million to conduct the study for a final choice, the state has allocated no money for the construction. Given the current state budget crisis, many participants at yesterday's meeting raised questions about financing.</p>
        <p>The project team said it was still too early to apply for any grants, and it does not yet have a price tag on a new tunnel or a new bridge. To rehabilitate the bridge completely would cost about $1 billion, Mr. Waite said.</p>
        <p>The options eliminated in the last round include the construction of a bridge at a different location like Yonkers, the building of a tunnel from Suffern to Port Chester and the addition of commuter rail to the existing bridge.</p>
        <p>The team will present the 15 options to the public next week in two workshops. They will be held from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Power Authority in White Plains on Tuesday and at the Palisades Mall in West Nyack on Wednesday.</p>
