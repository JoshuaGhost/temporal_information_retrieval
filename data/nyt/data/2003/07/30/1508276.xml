        <p>Whether true or not, accusations that MCI used fraudulent methods to reduce the access charges it pays to other phone companies could make it harder for the company to keep some of its current customers and to sign up new ones, according to industry consultants.</p>
        <p>The accusations are raising new questions about the reliability of the financial data and projections that MCI is giving to creditors and to the federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan overseeing its reorganization.</p>
        <p>''This is a new closet opening up and new skeletons coming out,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent analyst based in Atlanta. ''This is the biggest test yet for Capellas,'' he said, referring to Michael D. Capellas, the computer executive brought in last November to be MCI's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Capellas received some good news yesterday, when the court approved a settlement by which the company, still technically named WorldCom, agreed to pay Verizon $60 million to resolve fee disputes. Under the settlement, Verizon will not oppose the reorganization plan in court.</p>
        <p>MCI, the second-largest long-distance telephone company in the country, has been accused of disguising long-distance phone calls as local calls. Such a ruse would allow MCI to pay lower charges to the regional Bell companies like Verizon, SBC and BellSouth that complete the delivery of the calls to a home or business. AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance company, has separately accused MCI of sending calls to it via phone companies in Canada, in the process tricking it into paying to complete calls to areas where access charges are particularly steep.</p>
        <p>Former MCI executives said that efforts to avoid or reduce access charges date from the 1980's, when the company was an upstart led by William G. McGowan and was attacking AT&amp;T's monopoly in long distance. Bert C. Roberts Jr., Mr. McGowan's successor as chairman and chief executive, conceived some of the early efforts, according to an executive who left the company after the 1998 merger with WorldCom. The practices continued when Gerald H. Taylor was chief executive from 1996 until the merger.</p>
        <p>One unanswered question is whether the practices became more aggressive after WorldCom and Bernard J. Ebbers, its chairman and chief executive, took over. It was under Mr. Ebbers that the accounting frauds that eventually drove WorldCom into bankruptcy were carried out. Mr. Ebbers was forced to resign last year and was succeeded by John W. Sidgmore, WorldCom's vice chairman, who served as acting chief until Mr. Capellas was brought in.</p>
        <p>While investigators have not determined whether MCI did anything illegal, the company moved aggressively yesterday to contain the possible damage. It said it had hired the law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher to investigate the complaints about its practices. MCI also disputed AT&amp;T's suggestion that some of the calls sent through Canada came from government agencies and could have exposed sensitive information to foreign spies.</p>
        <p>In a written statement, Jerry Edgerton, head of government marketing for MCI, said all government traffic designated to be secure was encrypted and carried on MCI lines reserved for such calls and data.</p>
        <p>MCI also sought to play down the volume of phone traffic at the center of the controversy. It said that the calls sent to low-cost local phone companies accounted for just 8 percent of its traffic and that it pays the low-cost companies only $60 million out of its monthly access charges of roughly $1 billion.</p>
        <p>An MCI spokesman, Bradford Burns, said it was too soon to know whether originating codes on MCI calls had been stripped to mislead regional phone companies into thinking the calls were local. MCI's accusers said that the practice, which they termed ''call laundering,'' was common on calls made by MCI customers.</p>
        <p>Also yesterday, Onvoy, a Minnesota communications company that has been a subject of the inquiry, issued a statement denying accusations by a whistle-blower that senior executives at the company were aware of any scheme to defraud AT&amp;T. And the Manitoba Telephone System, which declined to comment on Monday about accusations that it was involved in a scheme to change billing codes, denied yesterday that it had tampered with codes. ''We didn't alter any codes,'' a spokeswoman, Bonnie Staples-Lyon, said. She added that the company had not heard from investigators examining the whistle-blower's accusations.</p>
        <p>Despite the growing controversy, there may be little effect on MCI's services to customers, according to regulators and other phone companies. In many states, the local phone companies face regulatory limits on what they can charge callers so they do not have the ability to raise rates on their own to cover any revenue lost.</p>
        <p>The practices may have allowed MCI to cut prices more frequently, which could have benefited consumers. But they might also have encouraged other phone companies to raise the cost of unregulated phone services to try to recover some of the profits they were losing.</p>
        <p>''It would not be zero, but it would be almost impossible to trace the impact on the average consumer,'' said Ronald J. Binz, a former Colorado consumer affairs official who is now president of Public Policy Consulting in Denver, a telecommunications and energy consultant.</p>
        <p>There may be a clearer effect on the major business customers that MCI is struggling to retain. Many of those corporate contracts include provisions that pass access charges along to the client.</p>
        <p>''MCI now has to go back to the drawing board and re-evaluate the access component of all their major contracts,'' said Richard P. Nespola, chief executive of the Management Network Group in Overland Park, Kan., which advises phone companies and their business customers.</p>
        <p>Analysts say that the reactions of big businesses to the accounting frauds disclosed last year at WorldCom and the company's subsequent bankruptcy filing suggest that those customers are unlikely to react precipitously to the new complaints, if at all. ''What became pretty clear in the first three months after the fraud was announced was that the big customers had few places to go,'' said Scott C. Cleland of the Precursor Group in Washington.</p>
        <p>The problem for businesses is that only AT&amp;T can match the scope of MCI's network and services, and few large companies want to depend completely on one carrier. But companies troubled by concerns over MCI's honesty or its long-term stability may gradually shift more of their business to its rivals. Those concerns could make it harder for a corporate communications manager to choose MCI for the first time.</p>
        <p>''The more MCI appears in the headlines in a negative way, the more the brand is undermined,'' said Patrick Comack of Guzman &amp; Company. Mr. Comack said the new accusations, especially if they result in criminal complaints, could take MCI out of the running for many government contracts. Such contracts account for roughly $1 billion of its annual revenue, which is projected this year at $24 billion to $25 billion.</p>
        <p>Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana and chairman of the House Commerce Committee, said yesterday that he would hold hearings on the new complaints this fall.</p>
