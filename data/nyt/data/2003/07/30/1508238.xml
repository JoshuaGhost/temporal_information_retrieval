        <p>The McDonald's Corporation reported a 5 percent decline in second-quarter profit yesterday, largely because of one-time expenses like advertising, promotions and real estate expenditures that are a part of the company's turnaround strategy.</p>
        <p>But those expenses, along with significant improvement in the company's domestic business, resulted in a 1.2 percent rise in worldwide sales at restaurants open at least a year, the first increase since the third quarter of 2000.</p>

        <p>The McDonald's Corporation reported a 5 percent decline in second-quarter profit yesterday, largely because of one-time expenses like advertising, promotions and real estate expenditures that are a part of the company's turnaround strategy.</p>
        <p>But those expenses, along with significant improvement in the company's domestic business, resulted in a 1.2 percent rise in worldwide sales at restaurants open at least a year, the first increase since the third quarter of 2000.</p>
        <p>The company also posted a 5 percent increase in same-store sales in the United States, the company's highest growth rate in that market in five years.</p>
        <p>''McDonald's is proving that it's fixable,'' said Mitchell J. Speiser, a restaurant analyst at Lehman Brothers. ''It was a broken brand. Sales were down, and the image was tired. But it is showing that a brand like McDonald's can be revitalized.''</p>
        <p>For the second quarter, net income fell to $470.9 million, or 37 cents a share, from $497.5 million, or 39 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The results met Wall Street's expectations, according to Thomson First Call.</p>
        <p>Revenue increased 11 percent, to $4.3 billion from $3.9 billion.</p>
        <p>Shares of McDonald's rose 89 cents yesterday, or about 4.2 percent, to $22.15.</p>
        <p>The results were the first tangible signs of a recovery in the company's core business, where sales have lagged.</p>
        <p>Much of the success in the company's United States business was caused by the introduction of products like a new line of salads with Newman's Own salad dressings and McGriddles, a breakfast sandwich.</p>
        <p>The company also credited its progress to enhancements in its customer service, fewer products and extended restaurant hours. The weak dollar also helped earnings, the company said.</p>
        <p>''I'm very happy with a lot of things that have occurred to date,'' James R. Cantalupo, the chairman and chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts and investors, ''but I'm not at the point where I'm declaring any victory in terms of a turnaround.''</p>
        <p>Despite the company's gains in the United States, it faces significant hurdles in several international markets. In the second quarter, sales in Britain continued to decline because of tough competition, and those in Germany were hurt by a weak economy.</p>
        <p>In Japan, Taiwan and China, sales were soft in the wake of concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS.</p>
        <p>In the coming months, McDonald's officials said, the company will continue to try to attract customers with new products. Many of them will be healthier alternatives to the company's basic fare, like chicken nuggets made entirely of white meat and milk-based drinks for children.</p>
        <p>The company also plans to increase its advertising and marketing. It will start a game promotion with the Best Buy Company with Best Buy merchandise as prizes. A new advertising campaign aimed at young adults, mothers and children, featuring the slogan ''I'm loving it,'' is set to begin in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that while the second quarter yielded positive results, McDonald's still faced challenges.</p>
        <p>''The real question is how much is sustainable and how much is more one-time product driven,'' said Janice L. Meyer, a restaurant analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''If they can deliver the right product, the right message at the right price and right quality, the consumer will respond. They have to do all those things, which isn't always easy.''</p>
