        <p>AFTER Sanford I. Weill passed the traditional retirement age of 65, his refusal to discuss succession at Citigroup started to worry shareholders. Five years later, Mr. Weill has finally allayed their concerns -- to a degree.</p>
        <p>Last week, he laid out what amounts to a three-year, two-step plan of succession at Citigroup. Now his critics will be watching to see if an emperor can gradually relinquish his throne.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weill, a prototype of the imperial chief executive, vowed to start detaching himself from the company he built into a global colossus. But his ambivalence about retiring was hard to miss. He brusquely deflected questions about when he would move out of his headquarters office on Park Avenue. Asked in an interview if he would unplug the fax machines that deliver daily assessments of the company's performance to his homes, Mr. Weill's quick response betrayed his reluctance.</p>
        <p>''I didn't say that,'' he said as he talked for more than 30 minutes without glancing -- as is his tendency -- at a nearby computer to check Citigroup's stock price. ''That, I did not say.''</p>
        <p>At year-end, he will hand off the chief executive's title to his longtime lieutenant, Charles O. Prince. But Mr. Weill has decided to stay on as Citigroup's chairman for more than two years after that, leaving doubts about when his reign will truly end. Nell Minow, the editor of the Corporate Library, who has been a harsh critic of Mr. Weill's management and compensation, questioned the length of the planned transition.</p>
        <p>''He's always had a sort of 'L'Ã©tat, c'est moi' attitude about that company,'' Ms. Minow said. ''The ex-C.E.O. should be out of the building and paying for his own office. Chairman of the board is not a full-time job. You want him to be gone. Not forgotten, but gone from the building.''</p>
        <p>That may be a stark view. But keeping the old boss standing in the shadows has been a recipe for trouble at big companies like Xerox, according to some close observers of chief-executive behavior. Warren G. Bennis, the chairman of the Leadership Institute at the University of Southern California, cited the botched succession of Paul A. Allaire, the former chairman and chief executive of Xerox, as a fresh example of the perils of a prolonged transition.</p>
        <p>Xerox hired G. Richard Thoman away from I.B.M. in 1997 as the heir apparent to Mr. Allaire. But three years later, Mr. Allaire, who had remained involved as chairman, shocked Mr. Thoman by demanding his resignation and reinstating himself as chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thoman's defenders complained that he never had a chance to run his own show because Mr. Allaire was hovering nearby. They said it was impossible for Mr. Thoman to command the respect and attention of his employees when his predecessor, whom they still saw as the ultimate boss, was in the room.</p>
        <p>All that Mr. Thoman would say about the experience in a March 2001 interview with The New York Times was that ''having Paul and I overlap served no one well.''</p>
        <p>MR. BENNIS, who has written several books about leadership, said friction between the new and old guard was not unusual. ''It doesn't usually work for the former C.E.O. and chairman to remain around and in the building,'' he said. ''It just is very hard to work out.''</p>
        <p>A powerful and successful executive like Mr. Weill usually has a certain aura, or shimmer, about him, Mr. Bennis said.</p>
        <p>''It's a hard shimmer to follow,'' he said. ''He's a Rushmorean figure. Unless Mr. Weill could abandon his ego to Mr. Prince, it's a hard go. I don't see him standing on the sidelines announcing signals.''</p>
        <p>Even Walter Wriston, the former chairman and chief executive of Citicorp, opposed the idea of keeping a former chief executive on as chairman. Responding to a survey conducted in 1991 by Institutional Shareholder Services, Mr. Wriston said, ''If the new C.E.O. wants to get moving with his or her agenda, a board seat occupied by the retired C.E.O. may be seen as an impediment to getting on with the job, particularly if new management feels that radical measures are called for.''</p>
        <p>Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, associate dean of the Yale School of Management, said that Mr. Weill, at 70, is trying to pull off a difficult and rare transformation from one type of corporate chief into another. For much of his career, Mr. Weill has been what Mr. Sonnenfeld described in his 1988 book, ''The Hero's Farewell,'' as a monarch. Monarchs, he said, are ''brilliant visionaries'' who fear that nobody will be able to maintain what they have built.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, the egos of kings of capitalism -- like J.P. Morgan and Juan Trippe, who ran Pan American World Airways -- are so entwined with their corporate empires that they resist retirement, Mr. Sonnenfeld said. Mr. Morgan ran his bank until he died at 76. Mr. Trippe stayed on as a director of Pan Am for seven years after he stepped down as chairman and chief executive in 1968 at the age of 68.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonnenfeld categorized another group of slow-to-go chief executives -- like William S. Paley, who ran CBS for 35 years, and Harold Geneen, who ran the ITT Corporation for almost 20 -- as generals. In the style of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, they eagerly ride back into the fray after having been unhappily sidelined.</p>
        <p>Mr. Paley famously returned to CBS as chairman in 1986, when he was 85, after the dismissal of his third successor, Thomas Wyman. ITT's board had to order Mr. Geneen, its chairman, not to attend management meetings unless he was invited by Lyman Hamilton, who succeeded him as chief executive and began dismantling the industrial conglomerate that Mr. Geneen had assembled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonnenfeld noted the involvement of Franklin A. Thomas in Citigroup's drawn-out drama. Mr. Thomas had been a director of CBS during ''its incredibly troubled succession history'' in the 1980's, and was chairman of the committee of Citigroup directors who were charged with planning for life after Mr. Weill, Mr. Sonnenfeld said.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, when Mr. Weill announced the long-anticipated plan, Citigroup officials said Mr. Thomas was on a plane to South Africa and unavailable for comment. Another committee member, Richard D. Parsons, the chairman and chief executive of AOL Time Warner, said it would have been a mistake to have Mr. Weill walk away immediately.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonnenfeld said Mr. Weill was trying to go out as yet another type -- an ambassador -- as Thomas J. Watson Jr. did when he stepped down as I.B.M.'s chairman and chief executive in 1971 . But Mr. Sonnenfeld said he was uncertain whether Mr. Weill, who has not always worked well with other strong-willed executives, would be able to switch roles so completely.</p>
        <p>''When a monarchic type tries to play the ambassador, you often wind up with a general,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said. Generals, he said, tend to ''second-guess and bring down their successors.'' He added that an acknowledgment by Mr. Weill last week -- that he had suffered withdrawal pains when he did not receive his daily update on the previous Friday -- was a ''chilling reminder that he is very tempted to get drawn back in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonnenfeld said, though, that he disagreed with Ms. Minow's view that, as a rule, retiring chief executives should make a clean break. He said there have been plenty of successful transitions by chief executives who have stayed close to their companies. Among those he cited were Bill Gates at Microsoft, Herbert D. Kelleher at Southwest Airlines and Andrew S. Grove at Intel -- all of whom had reputations as hands-on, domineering executives.</p>
        <p>Their successors ''never complained about an intrusive, meddlesome presence that somehow has a chilling effect'' on their ability to manage, Mr. Sonnenfeld said.</p>
        <p>All told, more than 250 big public companies have chairmen who formerly held the chief executive's title, said Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at the Corporate Library.</p>
        <p>Two months ago, Charles R. Schwab, the founder and chairman of the Charles Schwab brokerage firm, gave up the title of co-chief executive after five years of sharing it with David Pottruck. But Mr. Schwab is an active chairman who continues to attend meetings of the executive management committee, said Greg Gable, a spokesman at Schwab's headquarters in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''Ours is a unique situation in that they worked together as co-C.E.O.'s for five years,'' Mr. Gable said. ''It's a highly productive relationship.''</p>
        <p>MR. WEILL'S own experiment as a co-chief executive ended abruptly. John S. Reed, who was running Citicorp when it merged with Mr. Weill's Travelers Group in 1998, lost the power struggle within 18 months.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Reed was a relative stranger to Mr. Weill -- unlike Mr. Prince, a lawyer who has been in Mr. Weill's inner circle for 17 years. In interviews with reporters and analysts last week, Mr. Prince said he did not intend to make any radical changes to Citigroup, and Mr. Weill repeatedly expressed his affection for Mr. Prince.</p>
        <p>While some critics are skeptical that Mr. Weill will uphold his pledge to step back by the end of 2003 and then walk away altogether after Citigroup's annual meeting in the spring of 2006, Mr. Sonnenfeld said he saw a glimmer of hope in Mr. Weill's philanthropic activities. The typical corporate monarch has no other passions, Mr. Sonnenfeld said, but Mr. Weill devotes much time and energy to Carnegie Hall and the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Indeed, Mr. Weill is already trying to expand his role in New York society through the proposed merger of Carnegie Hall and the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>But that's not to say he'll never, ever be back. ''A violinist can pack up his instrument and take it with him,'' Mr. Sonnenfeld said. ''But Sandy is a conductor. Citigroup is obviously his institution. Should it become imperiled, it will be hard for him to resist the urge to save it.''</p>
