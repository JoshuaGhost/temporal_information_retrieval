        <p>Taking a distinctively angular form that complements its setting at the oblique intersection of 125th Street, Morningside Avenue and Hancock Place, the new Harlem Health Center is already an architectural fixture. And it hasn't even opened.</p>
        <p>''They have brought a little class to the corner,'' said the Rev. Wayland Williams Jr., pastor of the LaGree Baptist Church next door. ''To beautify the area with this building, that says something good about how they feel about Harlem.''</p>
        <p>Designed by Perkins Eastman Architects, the 110,000-square-foot building is being developed by the New York Hotel Trades Council and Hotel Association of New York City Health Center Inc. to serve union members and their families exclusively. Clinics will include dentistry, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics and physical therapy. The center will be in the first five floors and basement. The sixth through eighth floors are offices. There is also 11,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
        <p>Clad in buff brick at its east end, the building presents far more transparent glass facades on its west end, where the waiting rooms will be. ''As you come closer, you'll see this activity,'' said Matthew E. Tether, project manager at Perkins Eastman. ''It will really make the site come to life.''</p>
        <p>Neighbors have long waited for a sign of life on what was an abandoned, vermin-infested lot. St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center planned a two-story primary and specialty care and diagnostic center in the early 90's but withdrew in 1996. ''To see something there now is a very positive thing,'' said Barbara Askins, president and chief executive of the 125th Street Business Improvement District. She envisions the new building adding pedestrians on the block, increasing the demand for shops and services and encouraging further development.</p>
        <p>''Our members are delighted with the location,'' said John Turchiano, a spokesman for the hotel workers union. Some 3,000 members live in the Bronx and can reach the center on their way to work, he said, and 5,000 live in Manhattan, most of them north of 34th Street. The $30 million project is expected to be finished in November.</p>
