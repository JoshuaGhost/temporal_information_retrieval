        <p>Jason Roach made another spot start for the Mets, but survived only slightly longer than in his major league debut as Atlanta beat New York for a second straight night.</p>

        <p>Jason Roach sat at the folding table in the middle of the Mets' clubhouse yesterday afternoon, peering into a laptop computer as he took mental notes on video of the Braves' hitters, his assignment that night. Behind him was an eager audience. The Brooklyn Cyclones were touring their parent club's locker room at Shea Stadium -- ''Wow,'' one player said -- and a handful were watching Roach use big-league technology.</p>
        <p>Roach improved on a shaky major league debut last month, but the Cyclones who stayed late watched a 5-3 Braves victory and a big-league rivalry.</p>
        <p>Already having a runner thrown out at home plate to end the second inning and having watched Roger Cede√±o ground back to the pitcher for a 1-2-3 double play to end the eighth, Mets Manager Art Howe tried salvaging the game with some ninth-inning creativity.</p>
        <p>Aware the Braves had asked umpires to have Mets starter Jae Weong Seo remove a Buddhist bracelet from his glove hand in the first inning Monday, Howe watched John Smoltz's white T-shirt flap as he ran in from the left-field bullpen for the bottom of the inning. White undergarments under nonwhite uniforms are against the rules, and Howe asked the plate umpire, Tim Tschida, to have Smoltz remove it.</p>
        <p>''A little gamesmanship,'' Tschida said later.</p>
        <p>Smoltz first tucked it under his uniform jersey, threw a ball to Timo Perez, and walked to foul territory, where a trainer trimmed off the end of the sleeve with scissors. Smoltz returned for his 33rd save after allowing a one-out hit to Ty Wigginton.</p>
        <p>Even players the Mets reject end up hurting them. Shane Reynolds, the veteran who signed with the Braves in April instead of the Mets, easily outpitched Roach. The Braves had averaged 6.7 runs in Reynolds's prior 15 starts, allowing him to compile a 5-4 record despite his 6.04 E.R.A.</p>
        <p>Roach had a bit of rocky beginning. He allowed a ground-rule double off the center-field warning track to the game's second batter, Marcus Giles, and a subsequent first-inning run. But he held his own until Vinny Castilla reached for an outside slider deposited it over the wall in right center for a two-run home run two outs into the sixth inning. Roach was bent over as he watched the ball fly out of the field, swiping at the grass behind the mound.</p>
        <p>That turned the Braves' 3-2 lead into a 5-2 lead in Roach's final inning. He allowed five runs on eight hits, lowering his E.R.A. from 21.00 to 12.00.</p>
        <p>Drafted as an infielder in 1997, Roach had pitched in college and returned to the mound in 1999 when his bat stalled. Roach's fastball hovers in the high 80's, and he needs precise command to be successful.</p>
        <p>The Mets promoted Roach last month over the top prospect Aaron Heilman because he had commanded his fastball better in the strike zone at Class AAA Norfolk. But Roach was torched for seven runs in three innings in Anaheim in his major league debut and returned to Norfolk. Heilman is already in the Mets' rotation, without a victory after three starts, and Roach was recalled yesterday, with few alternatives available. Howe was noncommittal when asked if Roach would start Sunday, the next time the Mets need a starter.</p>
        <p>Smoltz, at least, left with a souvenir.</p>
        <p>''Now I have a lucky shirt with cutoff sleeves,'' he said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CLIFF FLOYD, who has an irritated tendon in his right wrist, may receive a cortisone shot if he does not improve in a few days but hoped to play this weekend. Floyd hopes to play before the All-Star Game break begins Monday.</p>
        <p>A magnetic resonance imaging test on AL LEITER (right knee) confirmed he had a bone spur that may require arthroscopic surgery after the season. Besides adjusting his workouts, Leiter was told he should be able to pitch soon after the All-Star Game break.</p>
        <p>Manager ART HOWE said he would consider using VANCE WILSON, one of the National League's top defensive catchers, at first base when MIKE PIAZZA (groin) comes off the disabled list.</p>
        <p>JOHN FRANCO remained unavailable since a tendon in his left forearm swelled after he pitched last Friday. ... MIKE STANTON allowed three runs, one earned, and six hits in one inning of a rehab assignment with Class AA Binghamton last night. ... JOSE REYES returned to shortstop after missing the last five games with a strained right hamstring.</p>
