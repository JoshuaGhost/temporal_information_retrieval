        <p>Palestinians expressed growing frustration today over the pace of talks with Israel, and what they see as Israel's unwillingness to grant concessions, and warned that the current truce could be in jeopardy if progress was not achieved soon on crucial issues like Palestinian prisoner releases and Israeli troop withdrawals.</p>
        <p>Israel said those issues remained open for discussion and emphasized that it was the Palestinians who canceled a planned meeting today between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas.</p>

        <p>Palestinians expressed growing frustration today over the pace of talks with Israel, and what they see as Israel's unwillingness to grant concessions, and warned that the current truce could be in jeopardy if progress was not achieved soon on crucial issues like Palestinian prisoner releases and Israeli troop withdrawals.</p>
        <p>Israel said those issues remained open for discussion and emphasized that it was the Palestinians who canceled a planned meeting today between Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his Palestinian counterpart, Mahmoud Abbas.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the United States tried to nudge the peace effort forward by announcing plans to send aid to the Palestinian Authority. In another step, in meetings in the last few days, American diplomats here have been urging Israel to consider releasing more prisoners, Israeli officials and news media reports said.</p>
        <p>Negotiations hit a snag after Israel announced on Sunday that it planned to release roughly 300 of the more than 5,000 prisoners seized since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000. Palestinians rejected the proposal as insufficient. Mr. Abbas, who has been under fire from his Fatah movement for not winning greater concessions, conferred with Palestinian leaders today in a bid to mend the rift.</p>
        <p>Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian legislator who has been in contact with Mr. Abbas, called the internal difficulties ''the labor pains of a new era.''</p>
        <p>He and others said the Palestinian feuding reflected the disappointment that the Middle East peace initiative has not yielded more.</p>
        <p>Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, the group responsible for many suicide bombings against Israel, said a truce declared last week could not be sustained if Israel did not meet Palestinian demands. ''We are patient, but patience has limits,'' he said. The demand for the release of Palestinian prisoners ''is a red line which we cannot pass.''</p>
        <p>Sheik Yassin spoke after meeting an Egyptian delegation that is seeking to extend the truce pledges by Hamas and Islamic Jihad to six months from three months. Fatah, the mainstream movement headed by the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and Mr. Abbas, has agreed to a six-month cease-fire.</p>
        <p>But the Israelis will have to make significant concessions if the peace momentum is to be sustained, Palestinians said today. ''Things have to improve, and the Palestinians have to feel the improvement,'' said Dr. Ali B. Jarbawi, a political scientist at Bir Zeit University in Ramallah.</p>
        <p>His personal yardstick is whether he can visit his mother, who lives 40 miles to the north in Jenin. ''I haven't seen her for 18 months'' because of Israeli travel restrictions, he said.</p>
        <p>In the early hours of this morning, a Palestinian gunman in Burkin, outside Jenin, was killed when soldiers responded to fire during a raid, a security official said. The gunman was shot and Muhammad Shalanish, wanted for organizing shooting attacks, was arrested, the official added. Palestinian witnesses said the man who was killed -- Iyad Shalanish, the brother of Mr. Shalanish -- had been inside the house and was not involved in shooting at the troops.</p>
