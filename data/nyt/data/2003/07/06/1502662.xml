        <p>If you build it, the celebrities will come. In theory.</p>
        <p>But that was not necessarily the case on Wednesday night as the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa primped for its long-awaited opening.</p>
        <p>Yes, there were the limber bartenders in the Gypsy Bar with shakers and martini glasses behind their backs and under their arms like bar-bound Michael Jordans.</p>
        <p>There were the multiple percussionists in the Mixx discoth√®que, incessantly thrumming on giant bongo drums wedged between their knees.</p>
        <p>There was the almost-new-car smell of the place.</p>
        <p>There were the hundreds of plasma television screens, from the giant ones surrounding the horse-race simulcasting room to the medium-large ones tuned to ESPN in the poker lounge to the wall of miniscreens with lush scenes of frozen drinks and the beach.</p>
        <p>But at 11:35 p.m., when the time came to have the big celebrity roll of the first set of dice and the first pull of the slot machine, there was a bit of confusion.</p>
        <p>Who -- and where -- were the celebrities?</p>
        <p>''Who is that?'' asked one cocktail waitresses, referring to a man in a multicolored cowboy shirt and black 11-gallon hat.</p>
        <p>''It's Courtney Cox's husband,'' another cocktail waitress assured her, referring to the man otherwise known as David Arquette.</p>
        <p>But no, the craps-throwing celebrity was Stephen Dorff. You remember -- they were both minor characters in the teen-angst sitcom ''Blossom'' in the early 90's.</p>
        <p>The initial slot player was Joe Pantoliano, who portrayed an abuser of women and was killed off last season on ''The Sopranos.'' At least Mr. Pantoliano had a New Jersey connection -- the ''Sopranos'' credit and his birth in Hoboken.</p>
        <p>''I did it,'' Mr. Pantoliano said to a dozen or so admirers after his third push of the button on the slot machine. ''I won $12.50. It's a great night.''</p>
