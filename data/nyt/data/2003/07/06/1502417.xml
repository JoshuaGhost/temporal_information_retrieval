        <p>IT was a very good quarter for technology and Internet funds. Maybe a little too good.</p>
        <p>After glancing at the top-performing funds of the second quarter, investors may be forgiven for wondering if they have somehow gone back to 1999. Many of the old favorites are there:</p>
        <p>Munder NetNet, up 36.9 percent for the quarter. Amerindo Technology, up 32.6 percent. Firsthand Technology Value, up 39 percent. In 1999, those three funds more than doubled; Amerindo rose an astonishing 249 percent, including reinvested dividends.</p>
        <p>Since peaking in early 2000, all three funds were still down by 80 percent through the second quarter, despite their recent gains. Much the same was true for many other funds at the top of the quarter's lists of the best-performing specialized funds.</p>
        <p>So a little skepticism is natural. Are the gains for tech funds, and the broader gains in the Nasdaq composite index, which rose 21 percent for the quarter, the start of a real rally in technology and Internet stocks? Or are they nothing more than what Wall Street inelegantly but descriptively calls a dead-cat bounce? In that case, the run-up will produce disappointment as shareholders wait for profits that never materialize.</p>
        <p>Perhaps not surprisingly, several top managers of technology funds say the cat is alive and well. The rally was inevitable, given how cheap many technology stocks had become, said Craig Callahan, chief investment officer of the Icon Funds, whose $267 million Icon Information Technology fund rose 34.2 percent for the quarter.</p>
        <p>''We saw the market from last July through March as anywhere from 40 to 55 percent underpriced,'' Mr. Callahan said. ''Tech stocks over the last fall and winter were priced as though we were heading into a depression. Now people are seeing that that's not the case.''</p>
        <p>In the late 1990's, many technology stocks had to increase their profits and sales by 50 percent to 100 percent annually to justify the prices that investors were paying for them, Mr. Callahan said. Today, even after the second-quarter run-up, valuations are much more reasonable, he said. Many smaller technology companies are now priced for annual growth rates of 15 percent to 25 percent, a far more realistic pace, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Callahan added that many stocks remained significantly undervalued and that he expected the gains to continue. ''This rally is emerging out of disgust, despair -- all the conditions that make a bottom.''</p>
        <p>That view was echoed by Kevin Landis, the chief investment officer at Firsthand Funds, which had the top-performing sector fund for the quarter, Firsthand Global Technology. It soared 51.7 percent for the quarter, and the company's other funds, including Firsthand Technology Value, its flagship, also sizzled.</p>
        <p>''For many tech companies, probably a growing number of tech companies, the fundamentals are getting better,'' Mr. Landis said. ''This really isn't a head-fake rally.''</p>
        <p>Despite the gains, valuations are still reasonable, Mr. Landis said. The sector's long decline caused Wall Street firms to dismiss many of their technology analysts, and, as a result, the stocks of medium-sized companies are languishing for lack of research, Mr. Landis said.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a fairly target-rich environment,'' he said. ''There are a lot of fairly good growth companies that are not being given their due.''</p>
        <p>Firsthand's performance in the second quarter is eerily reminiscent of its results in 1999, when it was among the hottest fund companies around. In a matter of months, in 1999 and 2000, its assets rose to $8 billion from $1 billion, and Mr. Landis bragged to reporters that the company's base in Silicon Valley gave it a crucial edge in spotting trends in technology.</p>
        <p>But Firsthand's vision worked only on the way up. When the Nasdaq composite index crumbled, Technology Value fell even faster. But Mr. Landis says his funds are not merely a high-risk bet on the direction of the Nasdaq. From 1995 to 1997, he made strong profits by investing in smaller, fast-growing technology companies that big money managers did not know about, he said. In 1998 and 1999, the market caught up.</p>
        <p>''We found ourselves owning a bunch of stocks that people couldn't get enough of,'' he said. But Mr. Landis says the situation is different this time. ''We've all learned from that period in history, each in a different way, to be a lot more skeptical,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Allison Thacker, a co-manager of the RS Internet Age fund, which rose 36.8 percent in the quarter, said that she believed that the fundamentals of Internet companies were improving as consumer use of the Internet continued to expand.</p>
        <p>Ms. Thacker, whose fund fell 73 percent from 2000 to 2003, acknowledged that technology companies had badly overestimated the demand for their products during the bubble, and that she and other managers had not been skeptical enough. ''Sometimes the companies are the last to capitulate and recognize that as well,'' she said. ''So you can't just listen to the companies.''</p>
        <p>TECHNOLOGY stocks also drove the performance of many top diversified funds. Oberweis Emerging Growth, which rose 37 percent during the quarter, invests heavily in technology and health care stocks, said James W. Oberweis, the fund's portfolio manager. One of the fund's top holdings is eResearch Technology, which digitally saves records used in medical clinical trials, Mr. Oberweis said.</p>
        <p>From January to June, eResearch's share price nearly tripled, to $22.34 from $8.38. Over the last two years, it has risen more than tenfold. At the end of the quarter, the stock had a price-to-earnings ratio of 77, based on its earnings of 29 cents a share for the last four quarters. That ratio is four times that of the average stock.</p>
        <p>On a price-to-sales basis, eResearch is even more expensive. With a market valuation of almost $500 million and revenue for the last four quarters of just over $50 million, the company is valued at nearly 10 times its trailing sales. Those levels would cause vertigo for many investors, especially after the steep declines during the last three years by once-expensive technology stocks.</p>
        <p>But eResearch is not just another Internet stock, Mr. Oberweis said. ''It's run up, but the business has grown, so it's gone up so much that the earnings justify a high valuation,'' he said. ''The difference between this and the Internet companies is that this is a real company with money flowing into the bank.''</p>
        <p>A skeptic might worry that Mr. Oberweis's comment comes uncomfortably close to the growth-at-any-price mantra used by many fund managers during the bubble. But, for at least one quarter, the optimists were back at the top of the charts.</p>
