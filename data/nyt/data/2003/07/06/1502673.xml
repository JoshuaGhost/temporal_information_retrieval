        <p>Kiel, a former safety at Texas A&amp;M, was sitting in his car in a mall parking lot when he was shot in the abdomen and leg by an unidentified man, the police said. The suspect, who was on foot, said something to Kiel and fired numerous shots, said Sandra Aponte, a police spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>No information about Kiel's injuries was released by Ben Taub General Hospital. (AP)</p>
        <p>BRONCOS' CARSWELL CHARGED: Denver tight end Dwayne Carswell was arrested on a domestic violence charge in Atlanta on Friday. The police accused him of picking up his girlfriend by the neck.</p>
        <p>Carswell, 31, was charged with simple battery, domestic violence and obstruction of an officer, said Sgt. Nikita Hightower, a spokeswoman for the Fulton County Sheriff's Department. He was being held on $2,500 bail.</p>
        <p>A court complaint said the 6-foot-3, 260-pound Carswell picked up Nkeiruka Anyamone, 25, by the neck outside a bar early Friday. The complaint also said Anyamone was later treated for a bite on the right arm. (AP)</p>
        <p>MIAMI'S BOWENS INJURED: Dolphins end David Bowens tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee earlier this week and will probably be out until at least November.</p>
        <p>Bowens, a pass-rushing end, was expected to be part of the defensive line rotation.</p>
        <p>His agent, Harold Lewis, said Friday that Bowens injured the knee Monday when he jumped off a ladder and came down awkwardly after changing a light bulb in his house. (Bridge News Service)</p>
