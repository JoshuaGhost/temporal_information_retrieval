        <p>I live in a city where artists display their work on abandoned buildings and fences around empty lots. Is it ethical for me to take home these items that face certain ruin? I concede that the artist's intent was for the pieces to be on public display, not to be hung in my living room. But in the 1800's, Lord Elgin brought Greek statuary to London for safekeeping. So am I a preservationist or a looter?</p>
        <p>Anonymous, Chicago</p>
        <p>The comparison of your swiping the street art of your neighborhood to Lord Elgin's bringing the Parthenon marbles to England, while playful, does suggest that you are, alas, a looter. Elgin couldn't get the O.K. of the Parthenon's creators, what with their being long dead, but you can consult the artists whose work you admire.</p>

        <p>I live in a city where artists display their work on abandoned buildings and fences around empty lots. Is it ethical for me to take home these items that face certain ruin? I concede that the artist's intent was for the pieces to be on public display, not to be hung in my living room. But in the 1800's, Lord Elgin brought Greek statuary to London for safekeeping. So am I a preservationist or a looter?</p>
        <p>Anonymous, Chicago</p>
        <p>The comparison of your swiping the street art of your neighborhood to Lord Elgin's bringing the Parthenon marbles to England, while playful, does suggest that you are, alas, a looter. Elgin couldn't get the O.K. of the Parthenon's creators, what with their being long dead, but you can consult the artists whose work you admire.</p>
        <p>The Athenians of the Periclean Age erected the Parthenon as a permanent structure to honor Athena, the polis and its people. Much street art is meant to be ephemeral; your taking it undermines the work itself. And while the Parthenon marbles ended up at the British Museum, available to all, there is, presumably, less open access to your living room. Thus, your actions are analogous to stealing flowers from a public park where they were planted for the enjoyment of all: they too will wither and die, but that doesn't mean you should swipe them.</p>
        <p>It is undeniable that the marbles Elgin brought to England are in better shape than many left behind, which have been through several armed conflicts and have endured the ill effects of Athens's auto emissions. But by that justification, the ghost of Aristotle can walk off with Ellis Island or the U.S.S. Constellation or Edison's Invention Factory, which have all been on the most endangered list of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. And in fact, the Greek government is eager to have what it regards as its statuary returned, and many nations and arts organizations support it. Such advocates are less apt to use the term ''safekeeping'' than ''plunder.''</p>
        <p>And so Elgin's behavior may have been as dubious as yours. Byron certainly thought so, excoriating Elgin in ''The Curse of Minerva'' as a man who should be turned to marble himself: ''So let him stand through ages yet unborn/Fix'd statue on the pedestal of Scorn.'' Count yourself lucky that Byron doesn't write an ethics column.</p>
        <p>We recently watched our neighbors' 2-year-old Labrador while they were out of town. The morning after the dog went home, we found our child's dental retainer on the carpet with a dog bite in it. We've known the dog most of its life, and he has never chewed anything at our house. Who should pay for a new retainer?</p>
        <p>Anonymous, Denver</p>
        <p>You should pay. When you agreed to watch the dog, you became responsible for his actions: that's a good part of what it means to watch someone's dog. And while it's true your neighbors didn't mention his chewing habit, they most likely didn't mention that he needs to be walked or that he can't be left alone with a hunk of sirloin; some things are assumed to be doggy characteristics, and chewing is one of them.</p>
        <p>It would be different if he'd done something extraordinary that no reasonable person could anticipate but that your neighbors knew about and didn't mention. If the dog had run up a big long-distance bill, phoning pals around the world -- talking ability aside, who'd know that he could dial with those paws? -- I'd put the phone bill in your neighbors' pockets. But under these circumstances, I'd put the dental bill in yours.</p>
