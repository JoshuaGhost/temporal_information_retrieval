        <p>A bill to restructure the United States Olympic Committee was introduced in the Senate yesterday, embracing recommendations made recently by an independent commission and a task force appointed by the Olympic committee.</p>
        <p>But the bill, introduced by Senator John S. McCain, Republican of Arizona, was challenged by a staunch advocate for overhauling the Olympic committee, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Republican of Colorado. Campbell, a former Olympian, is demanding that the bill, a proposed amendment of the 1978 Amateur Sports Act, include protection to keep Olympic committee headquarters in Colorado Springs.</p>
        <p>''I informed the Senate leadership that I will be putting a hold on the bill,'' Campbell said. ''The ball will be in their court. Somebody will have to come to me to offer me language that make the headquarters safe for Colorado Springs.''</p>
        <p>Campbell said he was convinced, ''without any names or proof, that there is an attempt to move the headquarters to New York.'' His tactics may stall McCain's hope of obtaining approval for the bill by Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>The bill calls for the creation of a nine-member elected board of directors: five would be independent, two would be chosen from the Athletes' Advisory Council and two from the National Governing Bodies' Council. The current board, widely viewed as unwieldy and fraught with conflicts, has 124 members.</p>
        <p>Under the bill, there would be four ex-officio members of the board: three International Olympic Committee members from the United States and the speaker of a proposed assembly, a largely advisory body with a broad Olympic membership. The ex-officio group would only vote on certain matters, and the votes of the three I.O.C. members would be equal to one vote of the board. The speaker would have no vote.</p>
        <p>The Olympic committee also formally nominated New York City as the United States' candidate city to the I.O.C. to play host to the 2012 Summer Olympics. Others expected to submit their applications by the deadline of midnight yesterday were: London; Paris; Madrid; Istanbul; Leipzig, Germany; Moscow; Havana; and Rio de Janeiro.</p>
