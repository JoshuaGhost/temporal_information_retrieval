        <p>Tsunami Memorial Unveiled</p>
        <p>A Louise Bourgeois memorial to the thousands of victims of the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami was unveiled yesterday in a national park on the southwestern coast of Thailand, The Associated Press reported. The work, ''Hold Me Close,'' was donated to Thailand by the French-born Ms. Bourgeois, 95, who is based in New York. Her memorial installation consists of a wooden walkway and two sculptures, one depicting a child's hand in the water; the other, inside a wooden dome, showing two joined adult hands. The Thai Culture Ministry's Office of Contemporary Art and Culture said the memorial was in Hat Nopparat National Park on the coast of the Andaman Sea in Krabi Province. The tsunami killed more than 8,000 people in Thailand, including vacationing foreigners and local residents, mostly from fishing communities on the coast. About 230,000 people in a dozen countries rimming the Indian Ocean are believed to have died in the disaster.</p>
        <p>Cash-and-Carry Art</p>
        <p>The collage ''Relative Value,'' by the Norwegian artist Jan Christensen, was simply irresistible -- to thieves, that is. The 7-by-13-foot canvas, right, displayed at the MGM Galleri in Oslo was covered with $16,300 worth of genuine currency from the artist's own pocket, The Associated Press reported. Unsurprisingly, it attracted the attention of the national news media and the thieves. The thieves smashed a window in the gallery late on Sunday and made off with the canvas and its pasted-on bills. ''We were afraid of something like this,'' Mr. Christensen told the Norwegian news agency NTB. ''The picture was insured and the gallery equipped with an alarm.'' He said ''Relative Value'' had been sold to Norwegian collectors, and the exhibition was scheduled to end yesterday. He added that he had not decided if he would make a new version.</p>
        <p>Putin Honors Rostropovich</p>
        <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has signed a decree awarding the cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich the Order of Service to the Fatherland, First Degree, a state medal, for his ''outstanding contribution to the development of world music and many years of creative activity,'' The Associated Press reported, citing the presidential press service. Mr. Rostropovich, 79, has been hospitalized twice this month for unspecified reasons. Two Russian newspapers reported that he was being treated at Russia's leading cancer clinic, but aides have declined to comment. His spokeswoman could not be reached immediately for comment on his health or the medal.</p>
        <p>Something Monstrous This Way Comes</p>
        <p>Lordi, the Eurovision Song Contest-winning Finnish rock band whose members dress as monsters, is bound for the United States, Billboard reported. Its latest album, The Arockalypse,'' is to be released in the United States on March 20 by the End Records, based in Brooklyn. The band will arrive in April to promote the album with a North American tour.</p>
        <p>'Grease' Car Makes Pit Stop</p>
        <p>A vehicle carrying the Danny Zuko and Sandy Olsson of a Dutch production of the musical ''Grease'' wound up in the orchestra pit during a performance on Sunday night in Almere, nine miles east of Amsterdam, The Associated Press reported. Jim Bakkum as Danny, the role played by John Travolta in the 1978 film, suffered a concussion, and Bettina Holwerda, in the role played by Olivia Newton-John, might have broken her arm, Dutch television was told by Peter Swinkels, the director of the Almere City Theater. No musicians were injured when the car, made up of the chassis of a red-and-white convertible and the engine of a golf cart, landed in an empty part of the pit.</p>
