        <p>In its decade together, the Venice Baroque Orchestra has thrown itself into the Italian Baroque repertory, with Vivaldi as a particular specialty. When the group performed at Zankel Hall on Thursday evening, Vivaldi was plentiful. The only other composer on the program was Tartini, and Vivaldi's works outnumbered his seven to one.</p>
        <p>The group, which performs standing (except for a cellist and a lutenist), is led from the harpsichord by Andrea Marcon. He and his players have developed an approach to Vivaldi quite unlike that of the British, Dutch and German groups that have also taken up his cause. It's not just that textures are remarkably transparent and tempos zoom at full throttle in the fast movements: those are hallmarks of lots of groups these days. Mr. Marcon's thumbprint is the remarkable flexibility of his phrasing.</p>

        <p>In its decade together, the Venice Baroque Orchestra has thrown itself into the Italian Baroque repertory, with Vivaldi as a particular specialty. When the group performed at Zankel Hall on Thursday evening, Vivaldi was plentiful. The only other composer on the program was Tartini, and Vivaldi's works outnumbered his seven to one.</p>
        <p>The group, which performs standing (except for a cellist and a lutenist), is led from the harpsichord by Andrea Marcon. He and his players have developed an approach to Vivaldi quite unlike that of the British, Dutch and German groups that have also taken up his cause. It's not just that textures are remarkably transparent and tempos zoom at full throttle in the fast movements: those are hallmarks of lots of groups these days. Mr. Marcon's thumbprint is the remarkable flexibility of his phrasing.</p>
        <p>As if to refute the old saw about Baroque concertos being ''sewing machine music,'' he is likely to ease the tempos suddenly, or speed them up, even in midphrase. At times his shifts were more extreme than you'll hear even in Romantic works, where rubato is part of the language. It takes some getting used to, but if nothing else, it adds an element of surprise to music that can easily slip into predictability.</p>
        <p>Predictability was circumvented in the program choices as well. Mr. Marcon opened the evening with four of Vivaldi's orchestral concertos. These compact three-movement works are essentially overtures or sinfonias (one actually bore the latter title), and they are packed with ideas and effects. Especially pleasing were the Concerto in G minor (RV 156), with its angular opening theme and its furious finale, and Sinfonia in G (RV 146), in which bursts of string tremolos created the effect of a drum roll.</p>
        <p>The rest of the program was devoted to violin concertos, with Giuliano Carmignola as the soloist. Mr. Carmignola is a deft colorist who brought a full-bodied, beautifully singing tone to the slow finale of Tartini's Concerto in A (D. 96), and a trimmer sound, as well as lightning speed, to Vivaldi's daredevil Prestos and Allegros.</p>
        <p>An unusual touch, in both the orchestral and violin concertos, was having the ensemble's lutenist, Ivano Zanenghi, improvise brief, inventive solos in the slow movements.</p>
        <p>The Venice Baroque Orchestra performs with the soprano Simone Kermes on Tuesday at Weill Recital Hall, Carnegie Hall; (212) 247-7800.</p>
