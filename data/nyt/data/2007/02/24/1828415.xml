        <p>Last June, at the United States outdoor track and field championships in Indianapolis, some of America's best runners lined up for the start of the 800-meter final. Most wore singlets with the name or logo of their shoe-company sponsor. One runner, the 22-year-old Nick Symmonds, wore an old shirt with the initials B. K.</p>
        <p>B. K. stood for Bishop Kelly, his high school in Boise, Idaho. Symmonds could have worn his jersey from Division III Willamette University, but that would have drawn the same blank stares.</p>

        <p>Last June, at the United States outdoor track and field championships in Indianapolis, some of America's best runners lined up for the start of the 800-meter final. Most wore singlets with the name or logo of their shoe-company sponsor. One runner, the 22-year-old Nick Symmonds, wore an old shirt with the initials B. K.</p>
        <p>B. K. stood for Bishop Kelly, his high school in Boise, Idaho. Symmonds could have worn his jersey from Division III Willamette University, but that would have drawn the same blank stares.</p>
        <p>When the race ended, there were more stares. In his first professional race, Symmonds had finished second, and his time of 1 minute 45.83 seconds was a hint of future success.</p>
        <p>The two-day indoor championships begin Saturday at Reggie Lewis Center. On Sunday, Symmonds will be favored in the 800 meters in only his fourth indoor race. His first was six weeks ago, when he ran the mile in 3:56.72 in Seattle.</p>
        <p>Some outstanding runners are passing up the indoor season to prepare for outdoors.</p>
        <p>Not Symmonds.</p>
        <p>''I like indoors to break up training,'' he said at a news conference here. ''Otherwise, I would go four months without racing. I'm used to racing year round.''</p>
        <p>Symmonds is 5 feet 10 inches and 165 pounds with a barrel chest. His running career began in the eighth grade.</p>
        <p>''I played hockey and soccer before that,'' Symmonds said. ''In my freshman year in high school, I tried juggling soccer and cross-country. Then I had a stress fracture in my left foot and gave up soccer.''</p>
        <p>Symmonds said that during his sophomore year of high school, the track coach convinced him to join the team.</p>
        <p>''My first race was a sprint medley,'' Symmonds said. ''I ran the 800-meter anchor leg and just took off sprinting. We won and I ran 1:57, which may not be fast in other places, but it was a good time in Idaho.''</p>
        <p>Division I colleges were hardly impressed. The only interest came from Boise State, Northern Arizona and Dartmouth. With a 3.8 grade-point average and hopes of becoming a doctor, Symmonds chose Dartmouth. Dartmouth did not choose him, leaving him on a wait list. He ended up at Willamette, a liberal-arts university with 1,800 students in Salem, Ore.</p>
        <p>He had tremendous success there, winning four Division III titles at 800 meters and three at 1,500.</p>
        <p>''I was a big fish in a small pond,'' he said. ''I was a late bloomer. If I ran for a Division I school, it might have been too tough for me.''</p>
        <p>It is tough right now. As Symmonds said, ''I train with 20 guys in Eugene, Ore., under that great coach Frank Gagliano and I eat dust in workouts.''</p>
        <p>Gagliano has no complaints.</p>
        <p>''He's a very fine prospect,'' Gagliano said. ''He's still young, but he's a great competitor with a tremendous wallop at the end. It's going to take a little time. He's really never lost, and he's got to learn how to take it when he does lose. I've got to be patient. He's got to be patient.''</p>
        <p>Gagliano is unsure whether Symmonds will eventually focus on the 800 or the 1,500.</p>
        <p>At the moment, the 800 offers more opportunity for Symmonds. Only three Americans will qualify at each distance for this summer's world championships and next year's Olympics, and the contenders in the 1,500 include Bernard Lagat and Alan Webb. In the indoor nationals, the mile replaces the 1,500.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to double here and run against Alan in the mile,'' Symmonds said, ''but the 800 and the mile are only an hour apart. Besides, the 800 should be easier to win.''</p>
        <p>NOTES</p>
        <p>The nationals offer 11 finals Saturday and 15 Sunday on an especially fast 200-meter Mondo track. The elite women include Angela Daigle-Bowen and Marshevet Hooker in the 60 meters, Shayne Culpepper and Sara Hall in the mile, Shalane Flanagan in the 3,000 and Jenn Stuczynski in the pole vault. Among the men are Marcus Bronson in the 60, Darold Williamson in the 400, Tora Harris in the high jump, Aarik Wilson in the triple jump and Reese Hoffa, Christian Cantwell and Dan Taylor in the shot put.</p>
