        <p>Days of aggressive negotiating by any number of N.B.A. general managers came to an anticlimactic conclusion yesterday when only three deals were reached at the 3 p.m. trading deadline, none of them involving star players.</p>
        <p>The Nets' Jason Kidd and Vince Carter, the Sacramento Kings' Mike Bibby and the Memphis Grizzlies' Pau Gasol -- the top players on the trade market -- will remain with their teams.</p>
        <p>The quiet passing of the deadline is a reflection of how difficult the N.B.A.'s salary structure and rules make it for teams to complete blockbuster deals in the middle of a season. Two other factors probably made league executives particularly conservative this season: this summer's promising draft and the mediocrity in the Eastern Conference.</p>
        <p>''I'm surprised when something big happens during the trade deadline,'' Donnie Walsh, the Indiana Pacers' president, said in a telephone interview. ''When you're dealing in big-name players, it's very confining to try and do trades during the season.''</p>
        <p>Three minor deals were completed yesterday. The Atlanta Hawks acquired point guard Anthony Johnson from the Dallas Mavericks for a second-round draft pick. The Portland Trail Blazers traded guard Juan Dixon to the Toronto Raptors for guard Fred Jones. And the Philadelphia 76ers traded forward Alan Henderson to the Utah Jazz for draft considerations.</p>
        <p>At least 10 players changed teams during five of the previous six trading deadlines. Seventeen players were traded on deadline day last year. A day earlier, the Knicks made a relatively significant move by trading for Steve Francis.</p>
        <p>Over the past few days, the hottest rumors involved the Nets, who were strongly considering options for their star players, Kidd and Carter.</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Lakers were the front-runners for Kidd, but negotiations reached a stalemate because the Lakers were unwilling to part with the young center Andrew Bynum, who is from New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Nets Coach Lawrence Frank confirmed yesterday that Kidd had a cracked rib, an injury he sustained earlier this month. Kidd missed two games and the All-Star Game with a sore back.</p>
        <p>Carter drew interest from several teams, including the Knicks and the Los Angeles Clippers. Bibby, the Kings' point guard, was coveted by the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Grizzlies and the Chicago Bulls had intense talks about Gasol.</p>
        <p>Rod Thorn, the Nets' president, said the team was never close to completing a deal. ''We had serious discussions with several teams,'' he said during a conference call with reporters. ''Obviously, they weren't quite as serious as I thought they were.''</p>
        <p>Thorn said he was cognizant of the message that giving up All-Star players would send to Nets fans.</p>
        <p>''When you're talking about trading players who are of a substantial reputation and playing ability within the league, and you are thinking about doing something that would involve players of lesser ability and lesser stature in the league, I think the perception would, most of the time, be that you were doing it for financial reasons or to help yourself cap-wise,'' he said. ''There may come a time when we'll do that, but our objective here was, if we traded a player of repute, that we would get something that would be useful to us, either at this time or very shortly.''</p>
        <p>Trading big contracts in the middle of the season can be a numbers crunch between the salary cap, the luxury tax and roster limits. Teams over the salary cap must make the salaries in a trade match within about 25 percent. Teams trading away a lucrative contract often take multiple players in return. That can force a team over the 15-player limit, which leads to roster cuts. Releasing players can be costly and can put a team over the luxury tax threshold.</p>
        <p>In the case of the Nets, Thorn was essentially debating whether to give up by trading one of his star players, even though the Eastern Conference race appears wide open. Thorn said he still believed in his team, especially after the Miami star Dwyane Wade sustained a serious shoulder injury Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''I think that we're like probably 12 other teams,'' said Thorn, whose Nets (25-30) are four and a half games behind Toronto for first place in the Atlantic Division. ''Now, we're going to be concentrating on trying to do our best to have the best record we can and see if we can make the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Teams were hesitant to give up first-round draft picks in trades because the draft is expected to be deep, with Ohio State center Greg Oden and Texas forward Kevin Durant as the probable headliners.</p>
        <p>Four teams did participate in significant deals earlier in the season.</p>
        <p>In December, the Philadelphia 76ers traded guard Allen Iverson to the Denver Nuggets for Andre Miller, Joe Smith and a two first-round draft picks. Last month, the Pacers and the Golden State Warriors were involved in an eight-player trade that included Stephen Jackson and Al Harrington going to the Warriors, and Mike Dunleavy and Troy Murphy going to the Pacers.</p>
