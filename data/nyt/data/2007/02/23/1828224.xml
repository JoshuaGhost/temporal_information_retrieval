      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Jacques Souquet had gone through several start-ups in Seattle, but he still was not entirely prepared for beginning a high-tech company in his native France.</p>
        <p>Failure is still a no-no here, creating a challenge for any start-up. Not to mention the idea that difficulty here seems a contradiction in terms for, after all, the word ''entrepreneur'' is French.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Souquet, 58, a compact man with a gentle manner, has a lot of rules to learn. When he once had to meet a deadline, he asked his colleagues to come in on a Sunday, which they did; but Mr. Souquet got a scolding from his lawyer, who lectured about the legal limits on the French workweek.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Souquet's company is up and running smoothly, and that is a testimony to recent changes in France and greater Europe: start-ups are no longer rare. Moreover, Europe's new entrepreneurs are turning West to learn the start-up culture bred in Silicon Valley before coming back here to apply their learning.</p>
        <p>After the Internet bust, the number of European start-ups in the computer and telecommunications sectors began growing again in 2003, according to the Center for European Economic Research, in Mannheim, Germany. And venture capital is pouring into start-ups, which last year attracted about $970 million, the highest level in a decade since the Internet boom ended in 2000.</p>
        <p>Overall venture capital fund-raising in Europe is more than twice the levels of 2002. In France, the number of new businesses set up last year rose 4 percent, to 233,052, over 2005, according to the Agency for the Creation of Businesses, a government body. The number of small American businesses also grew that much, at 4.5 percent, but at 671,800, there are nearly three times as many such American companies, according to the Small Business Administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Souquet's experience illustrates how far the Continent has to go if it hopes to match the United States. He was able to lure eight of his 27 employees back from the United States. And after two years, he is preparing to offer his product in 2008, a device that measures the elasticity of living tissue, to assist doctors in diagnosing and treating cancer.</p>
        <p>Still, Aix is not Seattle. French attitudes are a bit rigid, compared with the American approach of if-at-first-you-don't-succeed. And French law, which mandates a 35-hour week, still crimps entrepreneurial flair.</p>
        <p>''In a start-up environment, you cannot work a 35-hour week,'' Mr. Souquet said, referring to the time he asked his colleagues to work on a Sunday. ''My lawyer was furious,'' he said, fearing the company could be penalized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Souquet also recounted that at Stanford University, where he got his Ph.D. in applied physics, one of his teachers, William Shockley, a pioneer in transistors who shared the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics, taught by discussing failed experiments.</p>
        <p>''Then he would turn to another page, showing why the experiment failed,'' Mr. Souquet said, recalling images of his professor's Bell Labs notebooks. ''He called them constructive failures.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Souquet's company began with a colleague's fear that France was failing to retain its scientists. Georges Charpak, the winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize in physics, came to him.</p>
        <p>''He told me, 'It's dramatic,' '' Mr. Souquet said, describing how his French colleague begged him to help stanch a drain of French talent to the United States by promoting start-ups here. ''He said his best laboratory talent was going to the United States, that he was about to lose 15 people who were being offered grants by U.C., San Diego.''</p>
        <p>So two years ago, Mr. Souquet began gathering patents, including several from a Russian Ã©migrÃ©, Armen Sarvazyan, whose own start-up, Artann Laboratories, in West Trenton, N.J., held key patents for working with shear waves crucial to Mr. Souquet's device. A shear wave is so named because it moves through the body of an object, unlike a surface wave.</p>
        <p>At his previous start-up, SonoSite, which is based in Seattle, Mr. Souquet helped develop hand-held ultrasound devices that were essentially conventional technology, drastically miniaturized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Souquet's latest device is ''a new concept,'' Mr. Sarvazyan said. ''It opens an era, not only for elasticity, but for imitating the sense of touch, the feeling of a doctor,'' which is now often crucial in diagnosing cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Souquet had broad experience in ultrasound, having worked in the United States for Varian Semiconductor, before moving to ATL Ultrasound in Seattle. Together with a small group of ATL researchers, he founded SonoSite. When Mr. Charpak approached him, Mr. Souquet was the head of research in the medical division of Philips, the Dutch electrical giant.</p>
        <p>Weary of the constant travel and the bureaucracy of a global giant like Philips, Mr. Souquet heeded Mr. Charpak's cry for help. His idea, as outlined on the company's Web site, is to develop a device that would use ultrasound to measure the elasticity of human tissue.</p>
        <p>Since cancerous tissue loses much of its elasticity, such a device would be useful in helping diagnose and treat cancer in the breast, he said, but also the prostate gland, the thyroid and the liver.</p>
        <p>SuperSonic Imagine, with headquarters in a glass-and-steel corporate park outside this southern French resort city, was floated with Mr. Souquet's own savings, plus money from French government sources. Last March, a group of venture capital funds led by CrÃ©dit Agricole Private Equity pumped 10 million euros ($13 million), into the company.</p>
        <p>Amounts of capital like this are still only a fraction of the money flowing into start-ups in the United States, but in Europe, their impact is widening. The European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, set up in 2001, has seen its membership grow to almost 950 members.</p>
        <p>Representatives of the association tell of many technology success stories, like that of Xavier Niel, 39, a entrepreneur based in Paris who in 2002 started Free, now the No. 2 Internet access engine in France, after Orange, the France Telecom unit.</p>
        <p>Vectrix began in Italy about a decade ago, but came into its own only in 2003 when Carlo Di Biagio, the former Ducati Motorcycle chief executive, became its boss. It is about to bring to market a novel electric-engine scooter, with a top speed of about 62 miles an hour, developed with help from about $50 million in venture capital.</p>
        <p>''From the point of view of technology, this was a real innovation,'' said Alexia Perouse, director of life science investments at CrÃ©dit Agricole, explaining why they gave the money to Mr. Souquet. Later this year, the venture capital funds will consider a second grant of 20 million euros, Mr. Souquet said.</p>
        <p>In April, Mr. Souquet plans to talk with the Food and Drug Administration to have the devices certified. By next year, he hopes to begin delivering them.</p>
        <p>SuperSonic is focusing primarily on breast cancer, and its device employs different types of ultrasound waves that produce better images than existing diagnostic methods -- X-ray, ultrasound echography and magnetic resonance imaging.</p>
        <p>Conventional ultrasound, said Dr. Stephen B. Corn, who teaches at Harvard Medical School and is director of clinical innovation at Children's Hospital Boston, ''is not always sensitive and specific enough, particularly in cases of dense breast tissue.''</p>
        <p>''It looks very intriguing,'' he said of the company's work, ''very exciting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Souquet has hired a marketing director, opened an office in Seattle, and has chosen the tentative design for the first product. And his company has some of the Silicon Valley feel. People sit in open carrels, rather than closed offices; dress is casual. At lunch, employees sit around an open counter in the center of the building.</p>
        <p>''It's easy in the States,'' Mr. Souquet said, still bemoaning the French hardships. ''You know what to do; you go to Barnes &amp; Noble, you buy a book, 20 tips to create a start-up.''</p>
