        <p>Neil Genzlinger reviews Sam Marks play Nelson, directed by Kip Fagan; Frank Harts, Alexander Alioto and Samuel Ray Gates star (M)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The three actors in ''Nelson,'' a funny-creepy play by Sam Marks that opened last night, deliver crackling performances that keep you riveted, waiting for an equally crackling finish. Unfortunately it never comes. Mr. Marks instead sabotages an intriguing premise by falling back on the oldest escape clause in playwriting.</p>
        <p>The actors of Partial Comfort Productions, though, make the dead-end ride worthwhile, especially Frank Harts in the title role of a misfit who works as a flunky in a talent agency by day, but by night films gang violence for use in witness-intimidation videos. Mr. Harts is a jittery, conflicted mess, caught between his crazed boss, Joe (Alexander Alioto), and his friend Charlie (Samuel Ray Gates), who draws him into the underground-video gig. Mr. Alioto has a great time with his tightly wound character, who torments Nelson mercilessly over his infatuation with a minor actress represented by the agency. Kip Fagan, the director, adroitly keeps the jumpy characters from jumping into incoherence.</p>

        <p>The three actors in ''Nelson,'' a funny-creepy play by Sam Marks that opened last night, deliver crackling performances that keep you riveted, waiting for an equally crackling finish. Unfortunately it never comes. Mr. Marks instead sabotages an intriguing premise by falling back on the oldest escape clause in playwriting.</p>
        <p>The actors of Partial Comfort Productions, though, make the dead-end ride worthwhile, especially Frank Harts in the title role of a misfit who works as a flunky in a talent agency by day, but by night films gang violence for use in witness-intimidation videos. Mr. Harts is a jittery, conflicted mess, caught between his crazed boss, Joe (Alexander Alioto), and his friend Charlie (Samuel Ray Gates), who draws him into the underground-video gig. Mr. Alioto has a great time with his tightly wound character, who torments Nelson mercilessly over his infatuation with a minor actress represented by the agency. Kip Fagan, the director, adroitly keeps the jumpy characters from jumping into incoherence.</p>
        <p>When Joe stumbles on one of Nelson's gang videos, everything is in place for a collision of worlds that could be frightening or hilarious, but Mr. Marks seems unwilling to explore the most difficult of the possible paths and instead takes the easiest one. It may be that he handcuffed himself by writing a three-character play that actually has five characters in it. The fourth is a television set, on which the dangerous videos are seen by everyone but the audience, and the fifth is the actress Nelson pines for, visible only in a poster. Mr. Harts makes his character so interesting that you want to see him confront his demons straight on.</p>
        <p>''Nelson'' continues through March 3 at the Lion Theater, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton; (212) 279-4200.</p>
