        <p>To finally win with ease, after gut-wrenching finishes had become the norm for them, the Nets needed only to play physical defense, make their free throws and, most of all, play a team in as much disarray as the Boston Celtics.</p>
        <p>The Nets handed the Celtics their 17th consecutive defeat Friday night with a 92-78 victory before a surprisingly large and festive crowd at TD Banknorth Garden.</p>
        <p>The Celtics (12-37), who have not won since Jan. 5, left the court with forward Brian Scalabrine, a former Net, slapping his hands in disgust. He and most of his teammates looked down as they headed toward the locker room with boos as background noise.</p>
        <p>''I'm frustrated, I'm angry, I'm mad, whatever,'' said Celtics forward Al Jefferson, who scored 13 points and made only 2 of 6 field-goal attempts in the second half. ''We can't be mad at nobody but ourselves.''</p>
        <p>The Celtics star Paul Pierce, who had not played in more than seven weeks because of injuries to his his right foot and to his elbow, finally returned to the lineup. But he missed his first eight shots and finished with only 9 points.</p>
        <p>For the first time in quite a while, the Nets (24-27) did not allow their opponent to climb back into the game.</p>
        <p>They created a comfortable cushion with a 10-0 run that spanned nearly five minutes early in the second half. They continued to apply pressure with 6 quick points by the backup point guard Marcus Williams early in the fourth quarter as their lead ballooned to as many as 20 points.</p>
        <p>Williams finished with 17 points. Only Vince Carter, with 21, scored more for the Nets, who finally had the chance to dribble out the clock on their last possession.</p>
        <p>Eight of their 12 games before Friday night had been decided by 1 or 2 points, making the Nets only the second team in league history to go through such a stretch.</p>
        <p>Nets Coach Lawrence Frank said of his team's strategy Friday night: ''I think the emphasis was ignore the score and just worry about this play, and then when that play is over, go on to the next play. I think sometimes our struggle has been getting a little bit comfortable and losing focus when having a lead.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the two most tangible signs of the Nets' improved late-game performance were their free-throw shooting and their physicality on defense.</p>
        <p>The Celtics shot 34.6 percent from the field over all, and only 26.1 percent during the third quarter. Some of that was because of their inability to make open shots, but the Nets also made it difficult by swarming the lane and keeping the Celtics' post players off balance.</p>
        <p>''I thought they were physical on me the whole night, trying to get me off my sweet spot,'' said Jefferson, who had 17 rebounds.</p>
        <p>In their previous three games, the Nets had made 47 of 83 free throws (56.6 percent). Many of those misses prevented them from taking control of games.</p>
        <p>Against the Celtics, they shot 83.3 percent from the line, making 20 of 24 attempts.</p>
        <p>''The little things, I've always felt, always turn to big things,'' said Nets point guard Jason Kidd, who had 13 points, 9 assists and 8 rebounds. ''And for us, free throw shooting has kind of hurt us in some of these close games. But we keep coming to work every day and we try to get better.''</p>
        <p>At some point, the Celtics may wonder whether this season is worth much to them any more.</p>
        <p>When Pierce entered the game with 4 minutes 12 seconds remaining in the first quarter, the fans in the arenagave him a standing ovation. It was the most promising thing they had seen since Pierce last played, on Dec. 20.</p>
        <p>Pierce is the Celtics' leading scorer, and they undoubtedly have missed his play. But his veteran attitude could be equally as important.</p>
        <p>Before Friday night's game, Pierce said he was sure that his teammates, many of them younger players, were feeling the effects of the losing streak. But perhaps, he said, they were not feeling it enough.</p>
        <p>''To me, it's how bad it hurts,'' he said. ''At this point, I'm surprised I haven't seen a fight. Right now, to go through this type of losing streak, you got to be out there and playing with a certain rage, a certain kind of desperation, maybe harder fouls. You should be angry at this point.</p>
        <p>''Every game from this point out should be that opponent's toughest game. The last few games, I haven't seen that.''</p>
        <p>Pierce called this stretch ''the most frustrating time in my career.''</p>
        <p>It's like watching your little brother out there in a fight and you're helpless because you can't help him,'' he said.</p>
