        <p>Gears of War, the intense but glossy combat romp for Microsoft's Xbox 360, owned the competition (to use the online vernacular) on Thursday night as the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences announced the winners of its 2006 video game awards. Games for Nintendo's innovative Wii console also did well, while Sony titles mostly came up short.</p>
        <p>The overwhelming importance of word of mouth among gamers means that the annual Interactive Achievement Awards, now in their 10th year, are far less important in selling games than the Oscars are in the film business. Nonetheless, the prizes are the most prestigious laurels in the $25 billion video game industry. The comedian and actor Jay Mohr presented the awards at a ceremony and party in Las Vegas.</p>

        <p>Gears of War, the intense but glossy combat romp for Microsoft's Xbox 360, owned the competition (to use the online vernacular) on Thursday night as the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences announced the winners of its 2006 video game awards. Games for Nintendo's innovative Wii console also did well, while Sony titles mostly came up short.</p>
        <p>The overwhelming importance of word of mouth among gamers means that the annual Interactive Achievement Awards, now in their 10th year, are far less important in selling games than the Oscars are in the film business. Nonetheless, the prizes are the most prestigious laurels in the $25 billion video game industry. The comedian and actor Jay Mohr presented the awards at a ceremony and party in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>As if selling two million copies of Gears of War in just a few months were not enough, winning eight awards on Thursday was a big vindication of Microsoft's strategy to position Gears of War as the first must-have game for the Xbox 360. In lieu of another installment of the hit franchise Halo, Microsoft had gambled that Gears of War would be good enough to blunt Sony's introduction of its rival PlayStation 3 console last holiday season.</p>
        <p>Developed by Epic Games under the creative director Cliff Bleszinski (known as CliffyB to millions of gamers), Gears of War delivered. In addition to game of the year, Gears took awards for best console game, animation, art direction, online play, visual engineering, male character performance and best action-adventure game.</p>
        <p>Wii Sports, the showcase game for Nintendo's new console, came in second with three awards. The Wii has become a breakout consumer electronics hit because it allows people to play by simply making intuitive physical movements, like swinging a tennis racket, rather than having to master complicated controls. In addition to the award for outstanding innovation, Wii Sports also won for best design and best game-play engineering.</p>
        <p>Even without Wii Sports, it was a big night for Nintendo. Howard Lincoln, chairman emeritus of Nintendo of America, and Minoru Arakawa, former president of the same unit, took the academy's first lifetime achievement awards.</p>
        <p>The latest installment of Nintendo's hit Legend of Zelda series, called Twilight Princess, won for best story and character development, and Brain Age won for best handheld game for the portable DS machine.</p>
        <p>Sony's game unit, which has struggled recently, did not fare as well. Only one game published by Sony, LocoRoco, won any awards, taking the prizes for original music composition and best children's game.</p>
        <p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, the sprawling single-player fantasy epic from Bethesda Softworks, won for best PC game and best role-playing game.</p>
