      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The former state comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, praised his replacement on Friday, after a hearing at which a judge sentenced him to pay a $5,000 fine for his use of state employees to chauffeur his wife.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature voted on Wednesday to appoint Thomas P. DiNapoli, an assemblyman from Nassau County, as the new comptroller, two months after Mr. Hevesi resigned as part of a plea deal with the Albany County district attorney, P. David Soares.</p>
        <p>Speaking after his courtroom appearance, Mr. Hevesi praised Mr. DiNapoli, whom Gov. Eliot Spitzer has criticized as unqualified.</p>
        <p>''He's a very smart public official, and I think he will make an excellent comptroller,'' Mr. Hevesi said.</p>
        <p>Before resigning last year, Mr. Hevesi agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge of defrauding the government and to submit a DNA sample for the state's criminal database.</p>
        <p>In delivering the sentence, Judge Stephen W. Herrick described Mr. Hevesi's actions as ''unexplainable and totally unacceptable,'' but cited Mr. Hevesi's decades of public service, cooperation with the investigation and agreement to leave politics as reasons for the mild sentence.</p>
        <p>''Your fall from grace here has been total and from a very great height,'' Judge Herrick said. Mr. Hevesi served for more than two decades in the Assembly and later as New York City comptroller before he won election to the state comptroller's job in 2002.</p>
        <p>In accepting the sentence, Mr. Hevesi apologized to his family, to voters and to his former office staff, saying he took full and sole responsibility for his actions. ''I'm culpable, I'm responsible, and I apologize,'' he said, before a courtroom filled mostly with reporters.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hevesi's lawyer, Joel Cohen, was less meek. Before Mr. Hevesi's statement of regret, Mr. Cohen delivered what amounted to a defense of his client. Conceding that Mr. Hevesi's ''judgment eluded him,'' he nevertheless criticized the press for describing Mr. Hevesi as ''disgraced.'' He also hinted that Mr. Soares had been overly eager for publicity, saying that the district attorney ''is now very well known.''</p>
        <p>Leaving the courthouse, Mr. Hevesi said he had not decided what to do next.</p>
        <p>''I was waiting for today to decide what to do with the rest of my life,'' he said.</p>
