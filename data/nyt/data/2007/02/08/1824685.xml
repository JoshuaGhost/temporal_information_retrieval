        <p>''Roses are red, violets are blue; I hear a rumor, is it true?''</p>
        <p>That strained line of poetry set off the fiercest buyout battle since the epic contest for RJR Nabisco in the late 1980s, a struggle that was captured in the book ''Barbarians at the Gate.''</p>
        <p>The line, written by the real estate mogul Samuel Zell in an e-mail message last month, invited a rival bid topping a $48.50 a share offer for his Equity Office Properties, the biggest office landlord in the nation, with buildings in Manhattan, Chicago, Atlanta and other major cities.</p>
        <p>The reply: ''Roses are red, violets are blue. I love you Sam, our bid is 52.''</p>
        <p>The rhyme was true, but the comeback was not good enough.</p>
        <p>The private equity giant Blackstone Group, which was the initial bidder, won the bidding war for Equity Office yesterday with an offer of $55.50 a share, or $39 billion.</p>
        <p>The takeover battle, perhaps the most entertaining of recent years because of the big financial players -- and big egos -- involved, was called ''New York at the Gate,'' because it pitted two very different New York financiers against each other: Stephen A. Schwarzman of Blackstone, the leading figure in Manhattan's financial and charity circuit in recent years, and Steven Roth of Vornado, the onetime strip mall king of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The deal for Equity Office encapsulates two of the hottest trends in deal-making: the wave of capital flooding into commercial real estate and the growing power of private money.</p>
        <p>While residential real estate has slowed, commercial real estate, office buildings in particular, looks more attractive as the market finally shakes off the effects of the burst technology bubble in 2000. Many investors expect office vacancy rates to continue to decline in the next couple of years, with a corresponding rise in rents.</p>
        <p>And private equity firms like Blackstone have been among some of the most aggressive investors in commercial real estate. These firms have accumulated huge war chests: even now Blackstone is raising a new $10 billion real estate fund. The surge in buyouts -- which accounted for a fifth of the record $3.8 trillion in deals last year -- shows no sign of slowing.</p>
        <p>The Equity Office deal is the biggest leveraged private equity buyout ever, surpassing last summer's $32 billion deal for the hospital chain HCA, which itself was the first to surpass the previous high-water mark, the $30 billion deal for RJR Nabisco.</p>
        <p>Memories of that earlier contest were much on the minds of the bidders for Equity Office. At internal meetings when Blackstone would debate how to counter Vornado, Mr. Schwarzman would remind his bankers: ''We don't want to be K.K.R.,'' referring to the buyout of RJR Nabisco that turned out a disappointment to Mr. Schwarzman's archrival, Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>''We need to remember this is just another deal,'' Mr. Schwarzman said, according to people close to the firm.</p>
        <p>Blackstone had a huge incentive to make the deal. The firm will pay itself an ''acquisition fee'' worth about half of 1 percent of the deal -- the equivalent of about $200 million just for winning the auction, no matter how well the investment turns out. (Blackstone is not alone. Its advisers, Goldman Sachs and the law firm Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett, will also earn millions of dollars in fees.)</p>
        <p>And Blackstone will waste no time disposing of some of its newly acquired assets, taking advantage of the hot Manhattan real estate market. All but one of Equity Office's eight buildings in New York -- the Verizon building at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas -- are expected to be sold to Harry Macklowe for about $7 billion, some simultaneously with Friday's closing.</p>
        <p>Blackstone was a winner, but Mr. Zell, 65, a raspy-voiced tycoon with a penchant for doggerel, music boxes and Ducati motorcycles, was an even bigger one. Even his detractors are saying he ran a masterly sale, encouraging a bidding war that drove up the price for Equity Office by $3 billion. Mr. Zell stands to make more than $130 million on his shares and options in the company.</p>
        <p>''When Sam steps into the prime decision-making role,'' said Timothy H. Callahan, a former chief executive of Equity Office, ''no one is better able to be strategic. That's what shareholders have seen in the past, and that's why he will continue to wear the mantle as one of the leading lights of real estate.''</p>
        <p>It may have helped that Mr. Zell knew the bidders so well. As he said in an interview yesterday, ''This was like a family outing in the Turkish bath.''</p>
        <p>The son of Jewish immigrants who fled Poland hours before the Nazi invasion, Mr. Zell grew up in Chicago. He showed an entrepreneurial streak at an early age, buying issues of Playboy magazine from newsstand vendors and selling them at a marked-up price to his friends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zell first made his fortune in the 1970s by buying distressed real estate and fixing it up, earning him the nickname ''the grave dancer.'' In contrast to real estate moguls like Donald J. Trump, he shied away from trophy buildings, preferring strong financials to prestige. With his branding and financial acumen, he was one of the first to transform commercial real estate from a local affair to a national business.</p>
        <p>But a year ago, his company was selling for $29 a share. After several missteps, including buying $7.2 billion worth of Silicon Valley property just before the technology bust, Mr. Zell's reputation as the sage of the real estate industry was in serious jeopardy. Now the sale has restored his reputation.</p>
        <p>The battle for Equity Office started much earlier than any headline suggested. Last July, Mr. Roth secretly proposed merging Vornado with Equity Office to Mr. Zell. The two friends began negotiating back and forth for months.</p>
        <p>Not long after, Jonathan D. Gray, a 37-year-old rising star within Blackstone's real estate group, took Equity Office's president, Richard D. Kincaid, for breakfast at the Peninsula New York hotel in Midtown Manhattan. After small talk, Mr. Gray, who looks even younger than his age despite a 5 o'clock shadow, asked whether Equity Office's board would ever consider selling the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kincaid told him: ''If you came with a 'Godfather' price the board would have to listen.''</p>
        <p>Two months later, Mr. Gray, calling from his wood-paneled office on the 32nd floor of Blackstone's headquarters on Park Avenue, asked Equity Office's banker at Merrill Lynch, Douglas W. Sesler: ''What would a Godfather price be?''</p>
        <p>A price that could not be refused, he was told, would be at least $45 and closer to $50.</p>
        <p>In November, Blackstone reached a deal with Equity Office for $48.50 a share, and the assumption of $16 billion in debt, for a total of $36 billion. The deal by Blackstone floored Mr. Roth, who had been kept in the dark.</p>
        <p>Despite the huge price tag, industry insiders thought it was remarkably low. Barry S. Sternlicht, the founder of Starwood Hotels and chairman of Starwood Capital, called the deal ''the greatest heist of all time'' on a panel at a Bear Stearns conference last fall. Vornado's president, Michael D. Fascitelli, was also on that panel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth decided to mount a new bid. He reached out to several possible partners, including General Electric and Cerberus Capital Management, among others, according to people involved in the process. Vornado was interested in owning Equity Offices properties in major markets, but was looking to sell properties in ancillary markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sternlicht and Neil Bluhm, a Chicago real estate mogul who was Mr. Sternlicht's mentor in the late 1980s, approached Mr. Roth before Christmas about working together and buying those ancillary properties.</p>
        <p>They declared war on Jan. 18, lobbing in a bid of $52 a share. Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Gray scrambled to salvage their deal. They negotiated to increase their offer to $54 a share if Equity Office would raise the breakup fee to $500 million, from $200 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth, holed up in his office above Penn Station with expansive views of Manhattan, plotted return fire. A week later, Vornado bid $56 a share in cash and stock. While it was a higher offer, it also was much less certain because some of the payment was in stock and it would take months to be completed compared with Blackstone's bid, which could be completed this week.</p>
        <p>Equity Office, which was advised by Merrill Lynch and the law firm of Sidley Austin, said it would still back Blackstone and set a shareholder vote for yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth spent the weekend considering his options. He did not want to raise his bid, thinking that paying more than $56 a share was too much. And Blackstone had exercised its right to prevent Vornado from talking to Equity Office or having access to electronic data about the company. But he needed to do something.</p>
        <p>Flanked by his advisers, including James. B. Lee of JPMorgan Chase and Mark G. Shafir of Lehman Brothers, they decided to fire another shot on Sunday night. Vornado would not pay more, but it agreed to pay a larger cash portion and pay it much more quickly, making its bid more attractive.</p>
        <p>The new offer hit the tape just as the Super Bowl started. Mr. Gray of Blackstone, a Chicago native who had given up his seats to the game to stay in New York, missed seeing a remarkable kickoff return by the Chicago Bears as he jumped on the phone to strategize about what to do.</p>
        <p>The next day, Blackstone went to Equity Office with a new bid of $55.25 a share. Mr. Zell asked for another 25 cents; in exchange, the breakup fee was increased to $720 million.</p>
        <p>And then everyone waited for Mr. Roth's response. But there was none. Blackstone had won.</p>
        <p>By chance yesterday morning, Mr. Zell and Mr. Roth found themselves having separate breakfast meetings at the Carlyle Hotel on Manhattan's Upper East Side. It was 7:30 a.m., nearly two hours before Vornado would say that it was out of the race.</p>
        <p>Barred by Equity Office's agreement with Blackstone from having a conversation before the vote, Mr. Zell said he smiled at Mr. Roth. Mr. Roth smiled back.</p>
        <p>''I love you, Stevie,'' Mr. Zell said.</p>
