        <p>When creating her own handbag line, Joy Gryson places function before flash. ''I don't like showing a label; I prefer discretion,'' said Ms. Gryson, who designed accessories at Coach and Marc Jacobs before starting her own collection, Gryson, last fall. ''My style is clean and monochromatic, with a little bit of attitude, whether it's in a detail or the architectural structure of a piece of clothing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Gryson, 34, is a New Yorker by way of Korea: she was adopted at the age of 3. Her adoptive mother subsequently became the executive director of Family Focus Adoption Services in Queens. Her collection has a family focus as well: her husband is her business partner and her favorite handbag is named for their 4-year-old daughter, Olivia. ''I'm a wife, mother and businesswoman, and I'm always running from one meeting to another,'' Ms. Gryson said. ''I need a bag that looks great and isn't tricky to use.''</p>

        <p>Here Ms. Gryson combines a belted Marni jacket with a long-sleeve J. Crew T-shirt and skinny jeans by J Brand (she layers tunics, tanks, and jackets over T's and jeans all year). Her boots are from her upcoming shoe collection, and her bag is, of course, the Olivia.</p>
        <p>Ms. Gryson loves affordable basics from brands like American Apparel and Levi's. But some things she won't skimp on. ''I look forward to wearing flats over bare feet in the spring,'' she said. ''Marni, Sigerson Morrison and Lanvin make the most amazing ones.''</p>
