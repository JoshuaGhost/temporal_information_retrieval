        <p>YOU can tell a lot about a city by what it drinks. For an example, direct your gaze toward New Orleans, which is gearing up for the annual religious bacchanal known as Mardi Gras, falling this year on Feb. 20.</p>
        <p>New Orleans has always been a city of contradictions: a sinner's paradise where Catholic saints are revered like pop stars; a racial melting pot where the line between black and white is nonetheless starkly engraved (a fact that Katrina blew into the national consciousness); a city where creaky elegance abuts tawdry excess.</p>
        <p>That fractured identity is reflected on its municipal cocktail menu, which features comically bombastic drinks at one end -- Hurricanes, Hand Grenades, Big Gulp-size frozen daiquiris -- and sublime antique cocktails, like the Sazerac and Ramos Gin Fizz, at the other.</p>
        <p>All this was recently weighing on the mind of Chad Solomon, a New York bartender and a founding partner of Cuff and Buttons, a cocktail catering service that he started last year with Sasha Petraske, the owner of the downtown cocktail lounge Milk and Honey, and Christy Pope, a Milk and Honey bartender who is also Mr. Solomon's girlfriend.</p>
        <p>Commissioned with creating a Mardi Gras cocktail by the cognac house Pierre Ferrand to promote the use of Ferrand in cocktails, the Cuff and Buttons crew wanted to present a drink that, in Mr. Solomon's words, ''would honor the old traditions.''</p>
        <p>''New Orleans is an incredibly special place, with such an innate sense of self,'' said Mr. Solomon, a Houston native. ''It has resisted outside influences and temptations like no other city.''</p>
        <p>Befitting New Orleans, they didn't so much create as exhume. The Champs-Élysées, a mixture of cognac, lemon juice, Angostura bitters and yellow chartreuse, was the result. ''The drink's origins are hazy,'' Mr. Solomon said, but the Cognac and yellow chartreuse (a Big Easy standby) ground it firmly in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>The union of lemon and Cognac evokes a Sidecar cocktail, but the faintly herbal, honey-tinged flavors of the chartreuse cut a wide swath through the drink. The Champs-Élysées, served at Milk and Honey and at Mr. Petraske's other, more approachable bar, Little Branch, at Seventh Avenue South and Leroy Street, might ''be different from what's typical for a Mardi Gras drink,'' Mr. Solomon said.</p>
        <p>True, this is hardly the drink to inspire ''Girls Gone Wild'' loutishness. But it is pure New Orleans nevertheless: ornately flavored, gracefully intoxicating, salvaged from the past, a liquid prayer for the city that care forgot.</p>
        <p>Champs-Élysées  Adapted From Cuff and Buttons</p>
        <p>1 1/2 ounces Pierre Ferrand Cognac</p>
        <p>3/4 ounce Yellow Chartreuse</p>
        <p>1/2 ounce freshly squeezed lemon juice  Dash of Angostura bitters.  Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake vigorously and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.</p>
        <p>Yield: 1 serving.</p>
