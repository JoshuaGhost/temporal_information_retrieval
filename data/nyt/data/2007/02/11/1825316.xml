        <p>To the Editor: We have visited Anguilla several times and have always enjoyed eating at Dale Carty's fine restaurant, Tasty's, which was mentioned in ''The 10 Point Caribbean Escapes Plan'' by Michelle Higgins (Jan. 28).</p>
        <p>Although we certainly agree with Ms. Higgins's praise of the cuisine there, we would certainly not consider Tasty's to be ''high-end.''</p>

        <p>To the Editor: We have visited Anguilla several times and have always enjoyed eating at Dale Carty's fine restaurant, Tasty's, which was mentioned in ''The 10 Point Caribbean Escapes Plan'' by Michelle Higgins (Jan. 28).</p>
        <p>Although we certainly agree with Ms. Higgins's praise of the cuisine there, we would certainly not consider Tasty's to be ''high-end.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carty has created a casual, friendly spot to enjoy his Anguillan cuisine, decorated in island colors and staffed by warm, friendly and helpful personnel. The restaurant is, by Anguillan standards, very economical (dinner for two with wine costs about $100). Most importantly, Tasty's is very family-friendly. We have taken our two teenage children there, and the kitchen has always been more than willing to modify dishes to suit their tastes.</p>
