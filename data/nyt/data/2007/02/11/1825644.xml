        <p>He incorporates ''G.O.P.'' into his e-mail address and on his license plate, and the phrase ''personal responsibility'' is rarely far from his lips. But just how long has Christopher Healy, the newly elected state Republican Party chairman, been a Republican?</p>
        <p>''My first political campaign was as an 8-year-old poll watcher for William F. Buckley's mayoral race in 1965,'' Mr. Healy said of that New York City election as he fielded congratulatory calls during lunch last week at Trumbull Kitchen, a restaurant in downtown Hartford.</p>

        <p>He incorporates ''G.O.P.'' into his e-mail address and on his license plate, and the phrase ''personal responsibility'' is rarely far from his lips. But just how long has Christopher Healy, the newly elected state Republican Party chairman, been a Republican?</p>
        <p>''My first political campaign was as an 8-year-old poll watcher for William F. Buckley's mayoral race in 1965,'' Mr. Healy said of that New York City election as he fielded congratulatory calls during lunch last week at Trumbull Kitchen, a restaurant in downtown Hartford.</p>
        <p>In his new post, Mr. Healy, a former newspaper reporter and lobbyist who managed John McCain's 2000 presidential bid in Connecticut, has some hard work ahead of him before he returns to watching polls. Republicans are in the minority in the state House of Representatives, 107 to 44, and in the Senate, 24 to 12; Democrats have a veto-proof margin in both chambers.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Healy is battle-tested after managing the re-election campaign of United States Representative Rob Simmons, who lost his second district seat -- the most Democratic in the nation -- by 83 votes to Joe Courtney after a recount. ''Chris is a team player,'' Mr. Simmons said. ''He's loyal, and he's going to be a great partner to Governor Rell.''</p>
        <p>His first priority will be spreading the gospel of Gov. M. Jodi Rell's budget, which she unveiled last week. Mr. Healy will also be raising money and culling candidates. There are about a dozen mayoral races in May, more in November, then state races in 2008.</p>
        <p>The Democrats' landslide in November does not trouble Mr. Healy, who said he believed the public would come to see that Democrats in the Legislature were hard-core liberals beholden to unions and special interest groups.</p>
        <p>''A Rell Republican, on the other hand, believes in hard work, personal responsibility and smaller government,'' Mr. Healy said. ''We're an open party. We're not controlled by a narrow perspective.''</p>
