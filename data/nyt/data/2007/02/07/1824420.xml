        <p>The Toyota Motor Corporation, on pace to become the worldâ€™s biggest auto company, reports a 7.3 percent gain.</p>

        <p>Another quarter of record profits and sales released Tuesday by Toyota Motor painted a picture of a company whose momentum is pushing it into a virtuous cycle and relentlessly closer to becoming the No. 1 global auto company, analysts said.</p>
        <p>Toyota said net income rose 7.3 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31 to a record 426.8 billion yen, or $3.54 billion, from 397.5 billion yen a year earlier. It said revenue rose 15.2 percent to 6.15 trillion yen, also another record. The company said it had posted record sales gains every period since it began reporting quarterly results four years ago.</p>
        <p>With its roaring pace of profits, analysts say Toyota could pour huge sums back into developing new models and technologies, which in turn could further strengthen it competitively.</p>
        <p>Analysts say this cycle could allow Toyota to open a yawning lead over its rivals: the results show Toyota on track not only to pass General Motors and become the world's biggest auto company this year, but also to widen the divide between it and other Japanese companies and up-and-coming automakers in South Korea and China.</p>
        <p>''The gap between Toyota and the second-place car company will just get bigger and bigger,'' said Koji Endo, an auto analyst in Tokyo for Credit Suisse. ''It'll be tough for rivals to come up with products to catch up again.''</p>
        <p>Many of the gains reported Tuesday came in North America, Toyota's largest market, where it reported strong sales of its Yaris compact, Camry sedan and RAV4, a crossover sport utility vehicle. Toyota said it sold 764,000 vehicles in North America, which was 121,000 more than in the same period a year ago.</p>
        <p>G.M. has not reported its fourth-quarter sales yet.</p>
        <p>Worldwide, Toyota said, it sold 2.16 million vehicles during the quarter, 175,000 more than a year earlier. That kept the company on pace to meet its projected 9.34 million vehicles in sales in 2007, which would almost certainly allow it to surpass G.M., analysts have said.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Toyota reaffirmed its profit forecast of 1.55 trillion yen in the year ending March 31, though executives suggested the company may surpass it.</p>
        <p>''We intend to beat our forecast,'' Takeshi Suzuki, a senior managing director, told reporters. ''I don't think the trend of higher profits will change.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said Toyota's growing dominance was most evident in new fuel technologies, one of the industry's top potential growth areas.</p>
        <p>Toyota has seized an early lead in gas-electric hybrid vehicles, like its popular Prius, and is a front-runner in fuel cell vehicles, a futuristic technology that powers cars on electricity generated from hydrogen.</p>
        <p>Under its chief executive, Katsuaki Watanabe, Toyota has also strengthened its hand with a series of recent acquisitions, including taking a stake in Isuzu Motors, a truck maker, to gain access to expertise in diesel.</p>
        <p>Toyota's recent purchases have even fed speculation that Mr. Watanabe may next set his sights on bigger game: the struggling No. 2 American automaker, Ford Motor, with which Toyota has held talks about possible cooperation.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the acquisitions also highlight the fact that Toyota is the only big carmaker now in an aggressive expansion phase, while the Big Three in Detroit and others are scaling back or revamping. Mr. Endo of Credit Suisse and other analysts say that if Toyota faces any big challenge now, it is that the company cannot keep up with its own pace of growth.</p>
        <p>They say manpower shortages have become a constant headache at Toyota, as it builds factories at a rate of two or three per year, increasing its production capacity by 500,000 vehicles annually. One of its biggest challenges has been hiring enough qualified engineers to design all the vehicles in its expanding lineup and to run quality checks before new models hit the market.</p>
        <p>Analysts call Toyota's engineer shortage one of the biggest causes of a recent surge in recalls that have threatened the company's reputation for sterling quality.</p>
        <p>Another problem, say analysts, has been Toyota's hesitation to enter fast-growing emerging markets, where there is more risk but higher growth potential. It is only now building market share in China, after years of sitting on the sidelines.</p>
        <p>It also has yet to plunge full-blown into India, where it has a joint venture, though Toyota appears to be preparing to expand its presence in 2008 or 2009, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''Toyota can be a cautious company, and it was too cautious about developing markets,'' said Shinya Naruse, an auto analyst in Tokyo at Nomura Securities. ''Now it's catching up with an aggressive strategy.''</p>
        <p>Despite these problems, analysts say, Toyota has managed to achieve heady growth while the global auto industry is under intense pressure from overcapacity, ruthless competition and soaring prices for steel and other raw materials.</p>
        <p>Toyota's strong performance stands in stark contrast to those of G.M. and Ford, which have suffered major losses and shrinking market share in recent years. Toyota has also outperformed Nissan Motor, its Japanese rival, which last week lowered its full-year earnings forecast amid weak sales.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's earnings underscored what analysts and executives alike point to as the single biggest source of Toyota's success: its ability to build high-mileage, low-maintenance vehicles that are popular among global consumers.</p>
        <p>Toyota has been widely credited with keeping its eye on fuel efficiency during years when the Big Three and Nissan emphasized bigger and more profitable trucks and sport utility vehicles. Last year, as gasoline prices soared, Toyota filled showrooms while rivals struggled with the declining sales of gas guzzlers.</p>
        <p>Analysts say this trend toward high-mileage vehicles would probably continue even though gas prices have started receding again. They say lingering uncertainty over future oil prices, and also tougher government fuel-efficiency requirements in the United States and elsewhere, would continue to feed brisk demand for Toyota's vehicles.</p>
        <p>''Regulations and price uncertainty keep giving Toyota an advantage over the Big Three,'' said Mr. Endo of Credit Suisse.</p>
        <p>A weaker yen has also helped Toyota's bottom line by making its products cheaper abroad -- and thus more attractive -- and increasing the yen value of overseas earnings. The company said it also benefited from Mr. Watanabe's cost cutting, which has helped it to produce vehicles more cheaply than G.M. or Ford.</p>
        <p>These advantages have allowed Toyota to increase sales in the all-important American market, where Toyota and other Japanese automakers earn two-thirds of their profits.</p>
        <p>According to previously announced figures, Toyota's market share in the United States grew 2.1 percentage points last year to a record 15.4 percent, while G.M.'s and Ford's market shares fell 1.6 and 1.1 percentage points, respectively, to 24.3 percent for G.M. and 17.5 percent for Ford.</p>
        <p>In their most recent quarters, Ford reported a $5.8 billion loss, while G.M. said that it expects to post a quarterly profit after an accounting change and the restatement of earnings for the previous five years.</p>
