        <p>Everything was small about ''The Bends of Life,'' a new piece by Thaddeus Davis that was performed by Wideman/Davis Dance on Friday night at the Mary Lea Johnson Performing Arts Center of Calhoun School. But that relative smallness said a great deal -- all of it good -- about the aims of Mr. Davis, a dancer who came to public attention as a choreographer for the Fugate/Bahiri Ballet NY.</p>
        <p>And about his practicality. If you don't have enough in the bank for a standard New York engagement, find a welcoming home like the Calhoun School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and its simple black-box theater, one of those spaces whose utilitarian quality suggests a fertile ground where art can simply push through. And work with what you have, in this case a distinctive choreographic voice like Mr. Davis's and a continuing investigation of material: ''The Bends of Life,'' a dance commissioned several years ago by Auburn University in Alabama as a companion piece to an exhibition by the famed quiltmakers of Gee's Bend, Ala.</p>

        <p>Everything was small about ''The Bends of Life,'' a new piece by Thaddeus Davis that was performed by Wideman/Davis Dance on Friday night at the Mary Lea Johnson Performing Arts Center of Calhoun School. But that relative smallness said a great deal -- all of it good -- about the aims of Mr. Davis, a dancer who came to public attention as a choreographer for the Fugate/Bahiri Ballet NY.</p>
        <p>And about his practicality. If you don't have enough in the bank for a standard New York engagement, find a welcoming home like the Calhoun School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and its simple black-box theater, one of those spaces whose utilitarian quality suggests a fertile ground where art can simply push through. And work with what you have, in this case a distinctive choreographic voice like Mr. Davis's and a continuing investigation of material: ''The Bends of Life,'' a dance commissioned several years ago by Auburn University in Alabama as a companion piece to an exhibition by the famed quiltmakers of Gee's Bend, Ala.</p>
        <p>''The Bends of Life,'' set to beautifully chosen sacred and folk music and the words of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., is a quick, short trip through American history as reflected in a single Southern community, from sharecropping to the civil rights battles of the 1960s and on to the selling of the quilts, nearly at cost, for resale as high-end art objects. But there is no rancor in ''Bends.'' The worst injustices are, after all, part of a rich history, as an audience member suggested in a post-performance conversation with the artists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis and the eloquent Tanya Wideman-Davis, his wife, portray a couple moving through that history accompanied by two fine actors, Ronald McCall and Diane Parker, speaking the text. Some of the quilts that are woven into the choreography as smoothly as the words were made by the dancers' family members in Alabama. Mr. Davis seems to be working on the piece still. But the look of the movement is as bold and simple as the lines of a Jacob Lawrence painting. Mr. Davis is on to something.</p>
