        <p>General Motors has agreed to edit a commercial that first appeared Feb. 4, during the Super Bowl, after an advocacy organization complained that the spot was callous.</p>
        <p>The commercial, intended to promote the quality of G.M. vehicles, showed the nightmare of a factory robot in which it is driven to suicide after losing its job for making a mistake. After a discussion with officials from the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, General Motors said it would edit the spot to remove the suicide scene.</p>
        <p>The commercial was created by the Marina del Rey, Calif., office of Deutsch, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and has been appearing online as well as on television. Gay and lesbian organizations complained about another Super Bowl spot, for Snickers, centered on an inadvertent gay kiss; Mars, which makes Snickers, withdrew the spot and related video clips online after the groups decried the material as homophobic.</p>
