        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is about time that many colleges and universities realize that students need and want a place where they can relax that is apart from their campus (''Rural Colleges Seek New Edge and Urbanize,'' front page, Feb. 7). Having a vibrant downtown, Main Street or neighborhood commercial district meets that need and serves the school's recruiting process.</p>
        <p>For those colleges and universities that do not have such locations, it is an excellent idea to build such areas.</p>
        <p>Likewise, it behooves those institutions that are fortunate to have such places to make sure they support the challenge of downtown revitalization. In that way, everyone is a winner.</p>
        <p>Norman Mintz  Brooklyn, Feb. 8, 2007</p>
        <p>The writer is a co-author of a book about downtown revitalization.</p>
