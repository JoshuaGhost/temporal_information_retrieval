        <p>With the introduction today of getTrio.com, the short-lived but well-loved cable television channel Trio completes its online comeback.</p>
        <p>Before Trio, which is owned by NBC Universal, stopped broadcasting in January 2006, it was home to original shows like ''Facetime'' with Kurt Andersen and ''Film Fanatic'' with Amy Sedaris.

        <p>With the introduction today of getTrio.com, the short-lived but well-loved cable television channel Trio completes its online comeback.</p>
        <p>Before Trio, which is owned by NBC Universal, stopped broadcasting in January 2006, it was home to original shows like ''Facetime'' with Kurt Andersen and ''Film Fanatic'' with Amy Sedaris. Its companion Web sites, OUTzoneTV.com and BrilliantButCancelled.com, were introduced last June and May and make available some of the programming that appeared on the channel, as well as offering original content.</p>
        <p>The new site, getTrio.com, will offer tips on things to see, buy and do around the world. Those offerings will change daily and will be presented with the same contemporary sensibility that the cable channel aspired to, according to Lauren Zalaznick, the president of Bravo, who was in charge of the Trio channel.</p>
        <p>''The point of the third phase of Trio pop culture TV launching as a daily newsletter is that the original mandate for Trio was as a pop culture filter,'' said Ms. Zalaznick. GetTrio.com users may receive a daily e-mail message of tips and create an archive of their favorite items for later perusal. The information will also be available on a mobile phone platform.</p>
        <p>''You never know where cool stuff comes from, where trends come from, but usually it's a fundamental love of stuff. The Medicis loved their stuff and the Barneys Warehouse sale shoppers love their stuff, and to us, connecting those distant points on the pop culture art continuum is what it's going to be all about,'' Ms. Zalaznick said.</p>
        <p>The getTrio.com filter is overseen by Charlie Suisman, the man behind Manhattan User's Guide, an understated daily e-mail message which also provides information on things to do around town. M.U.G. was an early arrival in an increasingly crowded field of online culture filters that also includes the popular Flavorpill brand.</p>
        <p>GetTrio.com is ''the anti-Google, in a sense,'' said Jason Klarman, Bravo's senior vice president of marketing and brand strategy. It ''helps you find something in a world where you can search for anything.''</p>
