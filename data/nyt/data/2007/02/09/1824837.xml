        <p>Rock Reunions</p>
        <p>The Police, who are reuniting to perform at the Grammy Awards on Sunday in Los Angeles, will celebrate their 30th anniversary at the Whisky A Go Go the following day, The Associated Press reported, with an announcement of a tour expected as well. To enter the drawing for a spot at the Whiskey show, called ''The Police Rehearsals,'' fans must be ''legacy members'' of Sting's official Web site, Sting.com, he said in a posting Wednesday. Twenty winners are to be notified today. Sting, shown above in 1980 flanked by his bandmates Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers, fanned speculation of a Police reunion and tour when he said last month that they had been ''talking about'' doing something to commemorate their anniversary. The tour is expected to be announced at a news conference on Monday  The Who will headline the closing night of the Glastonbury festival in Britain, Reuters reported. The news came in London, where Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend announced a 28-city European tour set to start May 16 in Lisbon. They said the Glastonbury concert would take place on June 24, toward the end of the tour.</p>
        <p>Piaf Film Opens Berlin Festival</p>
        <p>The 57th Berlin Film Festival opened yesterday with ''La Vie en Rose,'' the French director Olivier Dahan's tribute to the chanteuse Édith Piaf, played by Marion Cotillard, The Associated Press reported. The film is among 22 competitors for the Golden Bear, the top prize at Europe's first major film festival of the year. The winner will be announced Feb. 17. Mr. Dahan and Ms. Cotillard are expected to appear at Alice Tully Hall at 8 p.m. on Feb. 28, when ''La Vie en Rose'' opens ''Rendez-Vous With French Cinema,'' the 12th edition of the showcase of French film presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Unifrance USA. Running through March 11, the series will present the American debuts of 16 French films.</p>
        <p>Rostropovich Reported In Cancer Clinic</p>
        <p>Two Russian newspapers reported that Mstislav Rostropovich, below, the cellist and conductor, is a patient at a Moscow clinic specializing in cancer treatment, according to The Associated Press. In Moscow, Natalia Dollezhal, a spokeswoman for Mr. Rostropovich, declined to comment on the reports in Komsomolskaya Pravda and The Gazeta. On Tuesday she said that Mr. Rostropovich was in satisfactory condition and preparing to celebrate his 80th birthday on March 27. On the same day Ronald Wilford, his manager in New York, told The Associated Press, ''It does not look good.''</p>
        <p>Sofia Coppola, Opera Director</p>
        <p>Sofia Coppola, whose films include ''The Virgin Suicides,'' ''Lost in Translation'' and ''Marie Antoinette,'' will make her debut as an opera director when she stages Puccini's romantic tragedy ''Manon Lescaut'' at the Montpellier Opera House in southern France in its 2009-10 season, Agence France-Presse reported. Starring in the opera for Ms. Coppola, right, as the Chevalier Des Grieux will be the French tenor Roberto Alagna, who became the focus of an uproar last year after he stalked offstage at Teatro alla Scala in Milan in response to heckling of his opening aria in a new production of ''Aida.''</p>
        <p>'Coram' Casting</p>
        <p>Jan Maxwell (''Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang''), Dashiell Eaves (''The Lieutenant of Inishmore'') and Bill Camp (''Heartbreak House'') will be among the cast of 40 when the English National Theater production of ''Coram Boy'' opens on Broadway at the Imperial Theater on May 2, after previews beginning on April 16.
