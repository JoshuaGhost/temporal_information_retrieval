        <p>Correction on Nov 27 article about 'contagious shooting' by police</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Nov. 27 about ''contagious shooting'' -- gunfire that spreads among police officers who believe that they, or their colleagues, are facing a threat -- referred incorrectly to a 1995 Bronx bodega robbery in which multiple shots were fired. Officers fired 107 rounds at the robbers -- not 125, the number initially provided by the police; and the robbers did in fact return fire. (The number of shots fired by the police was revised during the investigation, which also revealed that the robbers had fired back, according to law enforcement officials.) A reader pointed out the errors in an e-mail message in November; this correction was delayed while the Police Department and the Bronx district attorney's office checked their records.</p>
