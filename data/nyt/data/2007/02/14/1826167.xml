        <p>A popular candy store in Paramus, N.J., geared up for a day of panic buying ahead of Valentineâ€™s Day and a snowstorm.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>As the official opening hour of 10:30 a.m. neared, it was clear the restless assemblage could not be restrained much longer.</p>
        <p>''Guys, guys, just hold on,'' Linda Manzo hollered from inside Mrs. Hanna Krause Candy Inc. as prospective customers rattled the door outside. She looked around the store. ''Guys, are we ready?'' No one said no.</p>
        <p>She marched to the front door and unlocked the thin latch. About 25 customers, almost all men, surged in, led by Garry Kersten, a truck driver from Sussex with a bad back. A half-hour later he was still pondering, before ending up with chocolate crayons for his daughter's schoolteacher, a chocolate bus for her bus driver, a big chocolate kiss for his daughter and a favorite box of assorted chocolates for his wife.</p>
        <p>''We got the favors for our wedding here; my wife loves it,'' he said. ''On Valentine's Day, you don't want to screw up.''</p>
        <p>Something of a Bergen County monument, Hanna Krause Candy is located in a gingerbread house off Route 17 south, just past the Garden State Plaza mall. Outside is a huge wooden heart reading ''Feb. 14'' like a warning beacon to potential sinners. Inside by the register is a sign reading ''As Seen in The Sopranos.'' (The store was in the background of a shot at the mall.)</p>
        <p>The good news is that the business has an extremely loyal following, and you can bring your children to watch chocolate being made on site.</p>
        <p>The bad news yesterday was that the weather reports were full of dire forecasts of snow, ice, sleet and the dreaded ''wintry mix'' for Valentine's Day, threatening to wipe out a day on which every procrastinator at some point has a come-to-Jesus moment.</p>
        <p>''Snow is deadly,'' said Karl Krause, whose wife's family began the business 79 years ago. (He took her name as a show of fealty either to her or the gods of chocolate.) ''Ice is even worse. As long as we don't get too much snow, we'll be all right. But if you get 6, 8, 10 inches, that's bad. You have problems with ice. That's the worst.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Krause; his wife, Ingrid; and sundry family members and other employees were geared up for a day of premature panic buying. The three days or so of the usual Valentine's Day run are the busiest of the year, rivaled by Christmas and Easter but more interesting than either because people are likely to buy almost anything.</p>
        <p>''On Easter over two weeks we do maybe 14,000 rabbits, all sizes, milk and dark and white chocolate,'' said Mr. Krause's grandson Michael Manzo, whose mother is Mrs. Manzo and who is in charge of chocolate making. ''All day long doing rabbits, doing rabbits, doing rabbits. It gets messy and it gets tedious.''</p>
        <p>The ominous weather, or at least the nonstop panic purveyed by television and radio weather folks, was also on the minds of shoppers who grabbed at heart-shape boxes and chocolate-covered strawberries and peered at display cases of chocolate-covered apricot slices and dates, cashew bark and mint sponge, nut toppers and chocolate roses.</p>
        <p>Before long you could barely move, something that under other circumstances would have occasioned more than a bit of New Jersey attitude, but in this case left the supplicants as patient and meek as Russians lining up for bread during the heyday of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>They came with various agendas. Robert Craig bought boxes of chocolate as gifts for the physical therapists, fans of Krause's, who worked with him after he had knee-replacement surgery. Joseph L. Mecca, the chief judge of the Municipal Court in Paramus, had six boxes for home and office. (''How many girlfriends do you have?'' Mrs. Krause asked him jokingly.) Frank Marinaro of Little Ferry has been married for 46 years and gets his wife a box of chocolates from Krause's every year.</p>
        <p>There was much chatter in line about the weather, the risk of getting caught without the goods today and the wares. (Memo to Krause's: ''Seduction,'' ''Red Satin'' and ''Safari'' are fine names for chocolate assortments, but ''Endure Me'' is probably not the message you had in mind.)</p>
        <p>But, lest we forget, there was plenty of the spirit of the day as well. So SusanJoe Couturier waited patiently in line, reasonably certain her husband, Lionel, had already been there or soon would be.</p>
        <p>''We got engaged a week before Valentine's Day 18 years ago, and he brought me chocolate from here, and I thought, 'That's some of the best chocolate I ever had,' '' she said. ''So now he buys it every Christmas, Easter and Valentine's Day. He's a very romantic man.''</p>
