        <p>There was surprise yesterday at Ben Odierno's murder trial in a Manhattan courtroom when the jury came back with a verdict after only four hours. But in interviews later, several jurors said that while there was some debate, the verdict was inevitable.</p>

        <p>There was surprise yesterday at Ben Odierno's murder trial in a Manhattan courtroom when the jury came back with a verdict after only four hours. But in interviews later, several jurors said that while there was some debate, the verdict was inevitable.</p>
        <p>The defense, they said, painted a compelling portrait of a family in turmoil -- one in which Christine Odierno, the victim, often came across as less sympathetic than her husband, the killer.</p>
        <p>''It was very difficult to side with the prosecution when the majority of the character witnesses called were there for the defense,'' said one juror, Randy Levine, 29, associate media director at an advertising firm.</p>
        <p>One witness, Mrs. Odierno's elderly mother, did not help the prosecution's case when she failed to recognize the defendant in the courtroom, Mr. Levine said. ''She basically discredited herself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Miri Samuel, another juror, agreed and said it seemed that Mrs. Odierno could have been the instigator of the couple's fights. ''Christine Odierno looked like someone who could possibly start the whole thing, and there was nothing to contradict that,'' said Ms. Samuel, a sales representative for Estée Lauder.</p>
        <p>Several jurors wondered why Mrs. Odierno's sisters, who were usually present in the courtroom, were not called to testify. ''We were presented with this one-sided thing where this woman was the puppet master and he was the puppet,'' said Rebecca Welsher, 26, a human resources associate for Bear Stearns. ''Christine was the voiceless one.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, they said, Mr. Odierno came off as kind and grandfatherly.</p>
        <p>''He was a simple, decent man who tried to live a simple, happy life,'' Ms. Samuel said.</p>
        <p>Another juror, Joanne McGrath, assistant dean of admissions at New York University School of Medicine, said Mr. Odierno ultimately saved himself. ''Putting him on the stand was a big, big, big factor,'' she said, ''because he turned out to be a likable guy.''</p>
