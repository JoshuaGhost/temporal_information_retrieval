        <p>Rock Stars and Drug Troubles</p>
        <p>The British pop star Robbie Williams, right, spent his 33rd birthday yesterday in an unspecified rehabilitation center in the United States, where he is being treated for an addiction to prescription drugs, his agent said, Reuters reported. ''There will be no further comment on this matter,'' his public relations agent in London said. Mr. Williams achieved fame with the boy band Take That and was treated for drug and alcohol dependency after it broke up in the mid-1990s. He went on to enjoy a successful solo career.  The former Phish frontman Trey Anastasio, below right, 42, has been charged with a felony count of criminal possession of a controlled substance in connection with his arrest while driving erratically north of Albany in December, The Associated Press reported. Washington County District Attorney Kevin Kortright identified the substance as the painkiller hydrocodone. The indictment includes misdemeanor criminal possession charges for heroin, oxycodone and alprazolam, an antianxiety drug. Mr. Kortright said the maximum penalty for the felony was seven years in prison. Mr. Anastasio is free on his own recognizance. A call to his lawyer was not immediately returned.</p>
        <p>Goldman Family Seeks Simpson Data</p>
        <p>The family of Ron Goldman has subpoenaed records of any payments to O. J. Simpson by the Screen Actors Guild, the Producers Guild of America and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, The Associated Press reported. Lawyers for the family maintain that the records would reveal the residual payments and possibly the disposition of money received by Mr. Simpson for his appearances on television shows and in films, including the ''Naked Gun'' series. There was no immediate response from the organizations. The action was the Goldman family's latest attempt to collect after a 1997 civil judgment held Mr. Simpson liable for $33.5 million in the deaths of Mr. Goldman and his friend, Mr. Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. Including interest, the judgment is valued at $40 million. Last month a California judge barred Mr. Simpson from spending or transferring any earnings from past deals.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Omar Sharif, below, the Egyptian-born actor in ''Dr. Zhivago'' and ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' was sentenced to 2 years' probation and 15 hours of anger management after he pleaded no contest yesterday in Beverly Hills, Calif., to misdemeanor battery for punching a parking valet who refused to accept his European currency, The Associated Press reported. The Hardy Boys of the 21st century will be Tom Cruise and Ben Stiller, Variety.com reported. Actually, they will star in ''The Hardy Men,'' an action-comedy based on the ''Hardy Boys'' novels that originated in the 1920s and detailed the adventures of two mystery-solving brothers. In the film, planned for production next year by 20th Century Fox, the brothers, long estranged, would reunite to solve one last case.</p>
