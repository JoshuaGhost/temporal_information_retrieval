        <p>What does it mean to be the front-runner at a very early stage in a presidential campaign? Well, polling in the summer of 2003 showed that Joseph I. Lieberman and Gen. Wesley K. Clark were the preferred candidates among Democrats. John Kerry, who would eventually win the party's nomination, remained well back in the Democratic pack in the polls until he won in Iowa and New Hampshire in January 2004. Only about 10 percent of voters in a New York Times/CBS News poll in October 1991 could give an opinion of Bill Clinton, good or bad.</p>
        <p>What national polls are measuring, mostly, at this stage is name recognition, which may or may not mean anything when it comes to winning over the voters.</p>

        <p>That said, Republicans tend far more than do Democrats to coalesce around their early front-runners, however they achieve that status. In 1999, the Times/CBS News polls found that a good number of people had the governor of Texas confused with his father, but George W. Bush maintained his poll dominance over the rest of the Republican field even after voters came to know the other candidates.</p>
