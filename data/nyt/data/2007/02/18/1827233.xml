        <p>A police captain has been arrested for the second time in just over two months on charges of assaulting a 32-year-old woman with whom he had a relationship, the police said.</p>
        <p>The man, Capt. Alberto Sanchez, 41, was arrested Friday after the woman, whom the authorities did not identify, reported to the police that he assaulted her on Sept. 2 after an argument at a party on the Lower East Side. The police did not provide additional details but said that the woman declined to press charges at the time.</p>
        <p>Captain Sanchez, of Patrol Borough Queens North, has been suspended without pay for 30 days, a police spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Captain Sanchez was arrested on Dec. 3 in another assault on the same woman. At the time he was the commander of the Police Cadet Corps, a two-year apprenticeship program for college students who are being encouraged to join the Police Department. He was later transferred.</p>
        <p>He was accused in the December case of hitting the woman at a parking lot in the Bronx after she tried to break up with him, bruising her on the right eye, arm and leg, the police said. He was given a desk-appearance ticket and suspended without pay for 30 days, according to the police.</p>
        <p>Captain Sanchez was charged with assault in both cases. He joined the force in January 1992 and was promoted to captain in 2003.</p>
