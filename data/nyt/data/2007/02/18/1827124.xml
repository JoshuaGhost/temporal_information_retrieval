      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>If you should find yourself near Washington Square Park this week, which brings the 275th anniversary of the first president's birth, consider one of these popular restaurants near the western side of the park.</p>
        <p>BABBO ***  [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 777-0303; 110 Waverly Place (MacDougal Street); $$$; Review: 6/9/04.  Some restaurants revel in exquisite subtleties while others simply go for the gut. Babbo, blessedly, hangs with the latter crowd.</p>
        <p>Mario Batali, the culinary spirit behind Babbo and an ever-expanding empire of Italian (and, more recently, Mediterranean) restaurants, is an indulgent ruler. Babbo, a classic Italian, remains his throne, from which he bestows his most lavish favors and intense flavors upon an appropriately grateful dining public.</p>
        <p>BLUE HILL ***  [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 539-1776; 75 Washington Place (Avenue of the Americas); $$$: Review: 8/2/06.  Perhaps no other restaurant in New York City makes as serious and showy an effort to connect diners to the origins of their food as Blue Hill does. The menu, which changes frequently, currently includes Hudson Valley venison with Jerusalem artichoke purée, foraged mushrooms and Stone Barns mâche, and Berkshire pork with fromage blanc, spaetzle and Stone Barns arugula.</p>
        <p>A PALAPA  (212) 243-6870; 359 Avenue of the Americas (West Fourth Street); $; $25 and Under: 12/24/03.  At this sibling to La Palapa, an excellent Mexican restaurant in the East Village, a shiny Rock-Ola jukebox in the front room churns out Latin music at high volume. You won't go wrong starting with a taco. Al pastor is the standard combination of savory pork and sweet pineapple chunks. It's traditional because it's so good.</p>
        <p>LAS RAMBLAS  (646) 415-7924; 170 West Fourth Street (Avenue of the Americas); $; $25 and Under: 7/12/06.  This small tapas restaurant opens onto a busy stretch of West Fourth Street. One side of the room is dominated by a small bar; the other is crowded with counter-height tables ringed by stools.</p>
        <p>The best dish here is a frequently offered special of huge langoustines dusted in pimentón, cooked in cava and vinegar, and served sizzling hot in an earthenware dish. The restaurant's croquetas, or savory fritters, are served piping hot, with a molten core.</p>
        <p>LE GIGOT  (212) 627-3737; 18 Cornelia Street (West Fourth Street); $$; Article: 12/22/00.  If memories of Paris stimulate your romantic nerve, Le Gigot should set you atingle. From the beautiful parquet floor to the mirrored walls crisscrossed with polished wood to the little zinc bar and window seats, Le Gigot pulses with the welcoming spirit of a Parisian hangout. The current menu offers bouillabaisse, duck confit and crab cakes.</p>
