        <p>President Bush urged Congress again Saturday to create a tax break that would help people buy private health insurance outside the workplace.</p>
        <p>Repeating points made in his State of the Union address, Mr. Bush said that he wanted to create a standard tax deduction for health insurance and that he would ''continue to reach across party lines to enact common-sense health care reforms.''</p>
        <p>''Health care costs are rising rapidly, more than twice as fast as wages,'' Mr. Bush said in his weekly radio address. ''These rising costs are driving up the price of health insurance.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he was pleased to receive a letter this week from 10 senators -- 5 Democrats and 5 Republicans -- who wanted to work with him on the nation's health care system.</p>
