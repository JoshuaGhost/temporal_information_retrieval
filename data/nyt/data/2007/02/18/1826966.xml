        <p>''REBA'' and ''THE O.C.'': rarely linked in life, they're now partners in death. ''Reba'' signs off after six seasons with back-to-back episodes on Sunday (CW, 7 and 7:30 p.m.) and ''The O.C.'' ends its fourth and last season on Thursday (Fox, 9 p.m.). The Texas sitcom and the California soap opera had more than a few things in common: divorce, alcoholism, unexpected pregnancy, careers in real estate and pop music. Life in suburban Houston and Newport Beach hasn't been so different after all.</p>
        <p>If you want to understand better the issues surrounding the Geneva Conventions, the Bush administration and American treatment of accused terrorists it holds captive, read the essay ''No Exit'' by Joseph Lelyveld, former executive editor of The New York Times, in the Feb. 15 issue of The New York Review of Books. If you want your anger stoked, watch Rory Kennedy's documentary ''GHOSTS OF ABU GHRAIB'' (HBO, 9:30 p.m. Thursday). Depending on your sympathies, you can be irritated by the way the not-quite-openly polemical film simplifies some of the larger questions about American involvement in Iraq, or you can be outraged by its eyewitness accounts of what went on in the Tier 1 cellblock at Abu Ghraib. Among Ms. Kennedy's interview subjects are former prisoners and former guards and interrogators, including several convicted in courts-martial on charges of mistreating prisoners.</p>
        <p>On the lighter side, the cumbersomely named talk show ''SIT DOWN COMEDY WITH DAVID STEINBERG'' returns for a second six-week season beginning Wednesday (TV Land, 10 p.m.), and Mr. Steinberg kicks it off with a big get: Jerry Seinfeld. And in Sunday's new episode of ''THE SIMPSONS,'' ''Springfield Up'' (Fox, 8 p.m.), Eric Idle reprises his role as the documentary maker Declan Desmond.</p>
