        <p>SINS OF THE INNOCENT: A Memoir. By Mireille Marokvia. (Unbridled, $24.95.) Marokvia is no Sophie Scholl, the Munich student who was beheaded in 1943 for distributing antigovernment fliers, though they seemed to feel the same way about Hitler. The French-born Marokvia was married to an ambitious German artist -- ''handsome, built like a ballet dancer, chic in pants on which he wiped his paintbrushes.'' When she presents her ''best poème en prose,'' he admonishes her, ''Write a sonnet!'' He works as a government-sponsored artist-reporter, painting mines, barracks and soldiers, and she lives quietly in a mill near the Swiss-German border. Her memoir describes what it's like to hate the Nazis -- as she and her husband did -- but to protest unheroically: making a snide comment when a building super rants against ''unpatriotic people''; not finding humor in a party member's joke; walking out of a movie in which a Jewish prime minister is executed (''the audience burst into applause''). In December 1941, Marokvia, the author of a previous memoir called ''Immortelles,'' studies weaving in an art school as ''the Jews of Stuttgart'' board buses and are put on a train ''that never arrived anywhere,'' in the words of a local lawyer. She may have lacked moral courage, but she has literary talent, conveying the everyday horror of Nazi Germany. Eventually, a police chief accuses her of being a spy and tracks her movements -- until a Berlin acquaintance intervenes. ''Why didn't you kill Hitler?'' her husband's Parisian friends ask after the war. In this book, we can all discover the reason.</p>
        <p>VICE: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency. By Lou Dubose and Jake Bernstein. (Random House, $24.95.) If you think Dick Cheney exists in ''a parallel radical-right fantasyland''; if you believe that his chief of staff, David S. Addington, is an ''attack dog''; and if you consider Robert Novak ''the dark doyen of conservative journalism,'' you may find yourself high-fiving Dubose and Bernstein as you read ''Vice.'' Dubose, the co-author (with Molly Ivins) of ''Bushwhacked,'' and Bernstein, the executive editor of The Texas Observer, devote chapters to Cheney's Halliburton stint (''Lawless C.E.O.''), family life (''Lady MacCheney'') and recent achievements (''The Torture Presidency''). They also describe his feelings about the Freedom of Information Act and presidential power (you can probably guess). Despite having little access to Cheney and his colleagues, the authors capture the vice president's interiority with surprising certainty (''Cheney didn't want a normal life; he wanted to live, eat and breathe the White House''). Google, disgruntled civil servants, an ex-Grateful Dead lyricist and Ron Suskind's ''Price of Loyalty'' appear to be their sources. Dubose and Bernstein, who use the word ''cabal'' at least 10 times, seem aghast at Washington behavior, saying, for example, that the former State Department official Elliott Abrams ''apparently had no qualms about misleading legislators and the American people.'' This brings to mind a story that made the rounds in early-1990s Poland. At a briefing under martial law, a journalist supposedly asked the government spokesman Jerzy Urban if he was telling the truth. ''Is this the first time you've ever been to a press conference?'' was his reply.</p>
        <p>WHAT WAS ASKED OF US: An Oral History of the Iraq War by the Soldiers Who Fought It. By Trish Wood. (Little, Brown, $25.99.) During a March 2003 battle in Nasiriya, an ''almost incoherent'' gunnery sergeant ran up to another soldier: ''All he kept saying is 'Did you see what happened to us?' '' the soldier recalls. ''And then we started hearing the stories.'' In this book, dozens of war veterans tell their own stories of ''madness and chaos'' in Iraq. Dismemberment is a unifying theme: ''the severed leg of a marine''; a girl's foot, ''burned and smoldered,'' in a pink sandal; ''a dog running through the city with a femur in its mouth.'' Improvised explosive devices, a surgeon explains, have ushered in ''a whole new era of warfare,'' creating burn victims, amputees and quadriplegics. ''It reminds me of 'Johnny Got His Gun,' '' the surgeon tells Wood, an investigative reporter. The author's oral history seems polemically edited, consisting almost entirely of battle carnage, with a swipe at S.U.V.'s and Wal-Mart. Yet it offers a visceral account of the war, showing what it's like to know how ''bodies look when they're burnt up from bombs'' (like ''meat on the grill''); to smell blood (''It has this copper kind of iron smell''); and to watch ''a pink cloud'' rising from a blown-out building full of bodies. The firsthand accounts are honest, agenda-free and chilling.</p>
        <p>ON HER TRAIL: My Mother, Nancy Dickerson, TV News' First Woman Star. By John Dickerson. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $24.95.) As the first woman news correspondent for CBS Television, Nancy Dickerson interviewed Lyndon B. Johnson shortly after he became a vice-presidential candidate at the 1960 Democratic National Convention. ''Goddamn good news reporting, ma'am,'' Edward R. Murrow told her off camera. A Jackie Kennedy-style beauty, Dickerson also dated John F. Kennedy (before he was married); hung out with Gore Vidal, Frank Sinatra and Truman Capote; and, with her tycoon husband, raised five children in a McLean, Va., mansion. By 1970, she was ''the second-highest-paid correspondent'' on NBC. It was a glamorous life, mercilessly skewered in this sharp-as-a-serpent's-tooth memoir/biography. John Dickerson, Slate's chief political correspondent, chronicles his mother's lackluster cooking, ''clumsy'' tennis game, and rumored and actual affairs. He also includes mean things people said (''What did she have to do in the barn to get that tractor?'' a sound man joked when she borrowed one for a news segment). Indeed, it's an inverted story of child abuse. Dickerson describes how he and his brother tormented their mother: ''My 18-year-old brother held her over the balcony,'' he writes. ''If he'd let go she would have dropped into the front hall. We were laughing. She was terrified.'' Yet Nancy Dickerson, who died in 1997, was a ''steel magnolia,'' according to an NBC director, and, as Diane Sawyer says, ''hard-wired for courtesy.'' She remains legendary -- despite her son's disjointed, sketchy book.</p>
        <p>THE MIDDLE SEA: A History of the Mediterranean. By John Julius Norwich. (Doubleday, $39.95.) Norwich, the author of ''Byzantium'' and ''A History of Venice,'' starts his book about the Mediterranean on a promising note: ''I decided to begin, not with rocks and water, but with people.'' He tells us about a series of colorful kings, including William the Bad, ''a huge ogre of a man''; his son William the Good, a Norman king; Selim the Sot, who died in 1574 ''after consuming a whole bottle of strong Cyprus wine at a single draft and then slipping on the wet floor of the baths''; and (my favorite) a ninth-century monarch, Charles the Fat. Norwich hands out regal report cards, saying William the Good, for example, was ''weak and ineffectual.'' He also covers important milestones like the Crusades, piracy and gladiatorial contests. Too bad the book lacks cohesion, original thought and passion. For 600 pages, Norwich takes us on a pleasure-free cruise, offering up potted histories (''They mistrusted all things military,'' he writes about the Minoans. ''They made love, not war''); recycled Thucydides; and tourist tips, describing 18th-century inns that were ''verminous and foul-smelling.'' Finally, Norwich says dismissively, today's Mediterranean, clogged with Jet Skis and yacht marinas, has turned into ''a playground.'' Not an epithet one would hurl at this book.</p>
