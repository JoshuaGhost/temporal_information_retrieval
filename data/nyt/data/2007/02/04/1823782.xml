        <p>Editorial supports New York Gov Eliot Spitzer's efforts to reform education financing, cut property taxes for middle class, separate judicial pay from legislators' pay, modernize health care system and select expert comptroller who is more than a politician; says campaign donations system also needs overhaul</p>

        <p>New York's State Capitol is like a beehive, a beehive that has just been given a few hearty kicks by Gov. Eliot Spitzer. In almost every quarter, legislators or lobbyists are buzzing about the budget, about ethics reforms, about the election of a new comptroller. Some are so angry that they are threatening to use all the nasty little political weapons at their disposal to bring the energetic new governor down to their level.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer's promise to cut Medicaid costs and consolidate state hospitals has sent the powerful 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East union and hospital lobbyists into a high-intensity flap. The union is opposing Mr. Spitzer's candidate for State Senate in Nassau County, using taped telephone messages -- purportedly from a local nurse -- warning of future problems for ''local hospitals'' if Mr. Spitzer's candidate wins.</p>

        <p>New York's State Capitol is like a beehive, a beehive that has just been given a few hearty kicks by Gov. Eliot Spitzer. In almost every quarter, legislators or lobbyists are buzzing about the budget, about ethics reforms, about the election of a new comptroller. Some are so angry that they are threatening to use all the nasty little political weapons at their disposal to bring the energetic new governor down to their level.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spitzer's promise to cut Medicaid costs and consolidate state hospitals has sent the powerful 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East union and hospital lobbyists into a high-intensity flap. The union is opposing Mr. Spitzer's candidate for State Senate in Nassau County, using taped telephone messages -- purportedly from a local nurse -- warning of future problems for ''local hospitals'' if Mr. Spitzer's candidate wins.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Spitzer's fellow Democrats in the Assembly have been fuming about the governor's ''meddling'' in the Legislature's choice of a new state comptroller. Furious that not a single Assembly Democrat was a finalist for the job, they vented their displeasure at a closed-door meeting Tuesday and are said to be seeking revenge. This in turn has led to rumors that the ethics package that Mr. Spitzer and legislative leaders agreed on last month has moved off the fast track. If the aim is to have more public input, that's fine. If the idea is to nibble these reforms into oblivion, it's not fine.</p>
        <p>The other big power center in Albany -- the State Senate Republicans -- is also in a state of controlled panic about Mr. Spitzer's proposals for education financing. For years, Long Island Republicans have made it clear that one untouchable is the Rube Goldberg formula for parceling out state funds for schools. Mr. Spitzer proposes not merely to adjust the formula, but to shred it. In return, he promises to cut property taxes for the middle class, a vital concern for most residents outside the cities.</p>
        <p>To top it all off, the governor wants to separate judicial pay from legislators' pay. This upsets a lot of legislators because lawmakers have traditionally used judicial pay raises as a way to get increases for themselves. But making sure that judicial pay is not held hostage to legislative pay is clearly the right thing to do. So is revamping the education formulas, and reducing the property tax burden for the middle class. Modernizing the health care system also makes sense, as does selecting an expert comptroller who is more than a politician.</p>
        <p>All this positive energy has left lawmakers wandering around the State Capitol looking like people who had just lost their identity cards. Yet it makes no sense for them to plot revenge on a governor with a national reputation and with local popularity that continues to soar. Instead, they should rally to Mr. Spitzer's cause and clean up their houses together.</p>
        <p>We also have some advice for Mr. Spitzer and how he might court this hive of politicians. He should not, of course, cave on the important changes in government he has proposed, and he should continue to use the bully pulpit to whip them into line. But that's the cudgel. As a carrot, he should be careful to give credit where credit is due -- and sometimes even where it is not quite deserved. Credit is a very big deal in Albany, almost as big as campaign donations. Which, by the way, is something else that needs an overhaul.</p>
