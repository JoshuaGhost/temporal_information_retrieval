        <p>A Queens grand jury weighing evidence in the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man on his wedding day in November is entering its final stages with two prime witnesses set to testify on Friday.

        <p>Lawyers, a union official and others familiar with the process said that the police officers and the two witnesses, both of whom were injured in a hail of 50 police bullets that killed Sean Bell, were likely to be among the final people to appear before grand jurors who are now in their sixth week of hearing testimony and evidence in the case.</p>

        <p>A Queens grand jury weighing evidence in the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man on his wedding day in November is entering its final stages with two prime witnesses set to testify on Friday. Three of the five police officers who fired their guns that day are also set to sit for the panel beginning next week.</p>
        <p>Lawyers, a union official and others familiar with the process said that the police officers and the two witnesses, both of whom were injured in a hail of 50 police bullets that killed Sean Bell, were likely to be among the final people to appear before grand jurors who are now in their sixth week of hearing testimony and evidence in the case.</p>
        <p>The panel will determine whether any of the five police officers involved in the shooting will face criminal charges. One official said a decision could come as early as mid-March, though others cautioned against pinpointing a date for such action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell, 23, was killed on Nov. 25 when the officers fired into his car outside a Jamaica strip club where he was celebrating his bachelor party. Trent Benefield and Joseph Guzman, who were Mr. Bell's friends and were in his car with him, were wounded and will tell their stories to the grand jurors, lawyers for the men said.</p>
        <p>''They will tell the truth as to what occurred,'' said Michael Hardy, a lawyer for the men. ''I can't give you substance.''</p>
        <p>The office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, declined to comment last evening. The grand jury has been at work since the week of Jan. 22, officials said, meeting usually three times each week.</p>
        <p>Four of the five police officers involved in the shooting have voluntarily spoken to prosecutors and Michael J. Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association, said that beginning as early as Monday ''at least three of the four detectives are planning to testify,'' before the grand jury.</p>
        <p>''Since the beginning, they have been anxious to have their side of the story told publicly,'' Mr. Palladino said. ''As far as I'm concerned, I think the grand jury, in order to make an informed decision on this very important case, has to hear from the detectives.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Palladino said that after speaking with the union's counsel, Philip E. Karasyk, he understood that the three officers who were planning to testify include Detective Marc Cooper and Detective Paul Headley as well as a 28-year-old undercover detective who fired the first of the 50 shots and is being represented by Mr. Karasyk.</p>
