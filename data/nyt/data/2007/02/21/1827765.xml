        <p>The EMI Group, the British music company that produces artists such as Coldplay and the Beatles, said on Tuesday that it had received a new takeover approach from Warner Music Group, the latest episode in a seven-year merger effort that includes four failed attempts.</p>
        <p>EMI, which has issued two unexpected profit warnings over the last two months, said in a statement that it has received an approach from Warner Music, but there is ''no proposal currently for the EMI board to consider.'' The two tried to merge several times, the latest attempt being last year in a deal that was valued at around $4.9 billion, but negotiations collapsed each time.</p>

        <p>A seven-year dance between music rivals continues as the industry grapples with online music downloads, piracy and a decline in CD sales.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The EMI Group, the British music company that produces artists such as Coldplay and the Beatles, said on Tuesday that it had received a new takeover approach from Warner Music Group, the latest episode in a seven-year merger effort that includes four failed attempts.</p>
        <p>EMI, which has issued two unexpected profit warnings over the last two months, said in a statement that it has received an approach from Warner Music, but there is ''no proposal currently for the EMI board to consider.'' The two tried to merge several times, the latest attempt being last year in a deal that was valued at around $4.9 billion, but negotiations collapsed each time.</p>
        <p>In London trading on Tuesday, EMI's shares rose 13 percent, their biggest one-day gain in almost three months, giving the company a market value of £1.9 billion, or about $3.71 billion.</p>
        <p>The music industry has been hurt by online downloads of music, and companies have been wrestling with ways to promote online music sales that limit illicit copying. EMI is said to be considering a plan for online sales that do not have anticopying software.</p>
        <p>At the same time, music companies have been trying to merge as a way to compete with a larger rival, Vivendi's Universal Music Group, particularly in the United States.</p>
        <p>Recent merger attempts by EMI and Warner, whose stars include Madonna and Enya, were shelved because of fears that European Union regulators would block a deal.</p>
        <p>A European court in June annulled an earlier approval of a merger of Sony's Sony Music with BMG, a division of Bertelsmann that was created in 2004. The European Commission is expected to rule in March on a new proposal by SonyBMG, which would be the world's second-largest music company after Universal Music.</p>
        <p>Warner Music said Tuesday that it had made an approach to EMI on Jan. 24 after the Independent Music Publishers and Labels Association agreed to support a merger of the two companies before the European Commission. Warner said in a statement that it believes the agreement with the association improves its chances of getting regulatory approval of a combination.</p>
        <p>Sales at both EMI and Warner have slumped over the last year. EMI, based in London, said last Wednesday that it was experiencing an ''unprecedented level of market decline.''</p>
        <p>The company's music catalog includes bands like the Rolling Stones and Arctic Monkeys, but its new releases have not done as well. Sales at its recorded music division are projected to fall 15 percent, and earnings are expected to miss analysts' estimates, the company said.</p>
        <p>EMI reported in November that it had a loss of £30.6 million and said its sales had declined 6.1 percent in the six-month period ending in September 2006, compared with the same period in 2005.</p>
        <p>Warner Music has also struggled. The company said earlier this month that its net income dropped 74 percent in the three months ending in December from a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The company said that it had released fewer albums and that sales had been soft. A combination of the two companies may result in costs savings of about £150 million.</p>
        <p>''There may be some overlapping shareholders pushing for a deal,'' said Mr. DeGroote.</p>
        <p>In January, EMI ousted Alain Levy, chief executive of the recorded music division, and David Munns, the unit's vice chairman. Eric L. Nicoli, the parent's chief, assumed their responsibilities.</p>
        <p>EMI said it will consider any proposal that focuses on improving its business risks and that creates new value through a combination. A spokeswoman for EMI declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>EMI and Warner Music also tried to merge in 2000, but regulators opposed the plan. EMI made a second attempt to buy Warner Music in 2003, but failed when a group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. won the bidding for Time Warner's music unit.</p>
