        <p>When the Altria Group announced in the fall that it was planning to spin off its Kraft Foods division, Wall Street cheered. But among cultural institutions, the response was considerably less upbeat: as part of the restructuring, Altria, formerly Philip Morris, is phasing out its significant support for the arts, which has funneled $210 million to cultural groups over the last four decades.</p>
        <p>''It's the end of an era,'' said Sharon Gersten Luckman, the executive director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. ''Altria and Philip Morris supported dance and Ailey for over 25 years. They were at the forefront. There wouldn't be an Ailey if it weren't for them.''</p>

        <p>When the Altria Group announced in the fall that it was planning to spin off its Kraft Foods division, Wall Street cheered. But among cultural institutions, the response was considerably less upbeat: as part of the restructuring, Altria, formerly Philip Morris, is phasing out its significant support for the arts, which has funneled $210 million to cultural groups over the last four decades.</p>
        <p>''It's the end of an era,'' said Sharon Gersten Luckman, the executive director of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. ''Altria and Philip Morris supported dance and Ailey for over 25 years. They were at the forefront. There wouldn't be an Ailey if it weren't for them.''</p>
        <p>Altria's decision is just part of the changing landscape of corporate financing of the arts. Over the last decade, the portion of corporate philanthropy dedicated to the arts has dropped by more than half, according to the Giving USA Foundation, an educational and research program of the American Association of Fundraising Counsel. In 2004, the most recent year for which figures are available, support for the arts was 4 percent of total corporate philanthropy, compared with 9.5 percent in 1994 -- part of a general shift in giving toward health and social services.</p>
        <p>When companies do support culture, they are increasingly paying for it out of their marketing budgets, which means strings are attached to the funds: from how a corporation's name will appear in promotional materials, to what parties it can give during an exhibition, to the number of free or discounted tickets available to its employees.</p>
        <p>''Corporations are not Medicis; they never have been, they're not supposed to be,'' said Nancy Perkins, a senior vice president at Payne, Forrester &amp; Associates, fund-raising consultants. ''They're not in business to be philanthropic.''</p>
        <p>As a lead sponsor of City Center's Fall for Dance program over the three years of its existence, Time Warner had its logo splashed on everything from 160,000 festival brochures to 150,000 regular-season brochures to 400 subway posters and 5,500 bus ads. Its gift was in the six figures, City Center said, declining to be more specific.</p>
        <p>Arlene Shuler, president and chief executive of City Center, said providing this kind of exposure for a major sponsor was not a problem. In fact, she said, it was City Center's idea to put the Time Warner logo on every ticket envelope. ''We are very aware of the kind of recognition they deserve,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Time Warner was also happy with the deal, said Lisa Quiroz, the company's senior vice president for corporate responsibility. Time Warner gives to arts groups whose activities have ''a direct connection to our business,'' she said, and Fall for Dance brought in audiences of different ages and ethnicities, one of the company's goals.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming increasingly metrics-driven: you've got to show how your money has been leveraged and how that's been to the benefit of your company,'' Ms. Quiroz said. ''Ten years ago, you didn't hear people talking about measuring the impact of your dollars.''</p>
        <p>Some arts groups say they welcome the shift as an opportunity to partner with corporations. Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center -- who has also served as president of the AT&amp;T Foundation and is the author of the 1999 book ''Give and Take: A Candid Account of Corporate Philanthropy'' (Harvard Business School Press) -- calls this ''the sweet spot: the intersection between a company's business interests and charitable need.''</p>
        <p>The Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, for example, has for more than eight years been the exclusive corporate sponsor of the television series ''Live From Lincoln Center,'' underwriting it with $1.2 million annually and receiving, in return, a continuing association with a high-art program before a national audience.</p>
        <p>Hovering in the background, cultural executives acknowledge, is the potential risk to an institution's artistic autonomy: if companies have a say in some decisions, might they eventually demand it in others?</p>
        <p>Ms. Perkins, the fund-raising consultant, said corporations were less interested in dictating programming than in exploiting it -- as entertainment for their V.I.P. clients, for example, or for an image-enhancing connection with a high-end art form. ''They're not saying, 'I want to see more of the ''Bolero'' and less of the Stravinsky,' '' she said. ''They're looking to see the menu of opportunity for them.''</p>
        <p>More worrisome, Ms. Perkins said, is the lengths to which an arts group may go to secure marketing support: ''You've got to be careful that the art institution doesn't turn itself inside out to get the money and lose their identity.''</p>
        <p>Will Maitland Weiss, executive director of the Arts and Business Council of New York, a division of Americans for the Arts, which fosters partnerships between arts and business, agreed. ''The challenge isn't that evil Mr. Businessman is trying to trick you into doing something you don't want to do,'' he said. ''The challenge for an arts group is to go into a meeting thinking strategically: 'We want to reach this audience, you want to reach this market, and we'll both win.' ''</p>
        <p>When the Metropolitan Opera approached Panasonic about simulcasting its opening-night performance of ''Madama Butterfly'' last fall, Panasonic was happy to donate its jumbo screen in Times Square. This season the Met has added Panasonic plasma screens in its lobby areas -- clearly marked with the company logo -- for latecomers to watch performances. The screens also show highlights from past performances, like opera music videos, throughout the day.</p>
        <p>''I think it's good that companies can justify their gifts to the Met through marketing,'' said Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager. ''It's up to institutions like ours to create opportunities for sponsors.''</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn Academy of Music recently closed a $200,000 deal with Visa's Signature card to sponsor its coming production of the dance-theater piece ''Edward Scissorhands'' with both cash and in-kind donations. In exchange, the academy will advertise the card free in its programs, post Visa Signature signs in its patron lounge and provide the company with a block of free tickets to the production.</p>
        <p>That kind of support ''requires much more hands-on servicing of a donor, but that's fine; if that's the pool of money they're tapping, we're thrilled,'' said Lynn M. Stirrup, the academy's vice president for planning and development.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stirrup keeps track of just how the academy's corporate partners are taking advantage of the benefits offered. ''I want to be able to call those memories up and say, 'We entertained X amount of people, here is you making a speech, here is the number of employees who took advantage of employee opportunities,' '' she said. ''They want to make sure the dollars they're spending are worthwhile.''</p>
        <p>But proving a return on investment can be tough for an arts group. ''How do you quantify that in the arts?'' asked Vishaka Desai, president of the Asia Society. ''It's not an impact you can measure in dollars and cents and number of hits.''</p>
        <p>Since arts groups are vying for marketing dollars against major players, like sports events, they have to position themselves as partners. ''We can't compete with the numbers that a Nascar or the N.F.L. can provide,'' said Karen Brooks Hopkins, the academy's president. ''What we can provide is a tremendous impact that's targeted to a specific demographic.''</p>
        <p>Making that case is difficult for smaller groups, like Elevator Repair Service, an avant-garde theater ensemble, which last year received $5,000 from Altria. ''This was the only corporate funding we got,'' said John Collins, the company's artistic director. ''As much as 5 percent of our gross income was coming from them at a certain point.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weiss of the Arts and Business Council noted: ''It's hard for small arts organizations to compete for sponsorships when businesses are looking for a breadth of reach. Sometimes I say to them: 'If you can't be part of a consortium, don't waste your time. You've got an audience of 10,000; they want to reach people in the hundreds of thousands.' ''</p>
        <p>Those kinds of donations often involve specific high-profile programs or building projects that come with so-called naming opportunities. What has become more difficult to land -- from both corporations and wealthy individuals -- is general operating support. Altria was among the few corporations that provided such contributions.</p>
        <p>Of the 272 arts organizations that received grants from Altria in 2006, for a total of $7.5 million, only about half will receive a grant in 2007, which may well be their last. ''This year, the majority of grants we make will be final,'' said Jennifer P. Goodale, Altria's vice president for contributions. (The individual companies spun out of Altria may still support the arts, but they are not expected to do so at the same level.)</p>
        <p>To try to make sure that other companies fill the gap, Altria has been holding events to introduce grantees to various corporations and writing recommendations on behalf of arts organizations. ''I feel very optimistic that other corporations will step in,'' Ms. Goodale said.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether that will happen. Given that, experts say, arts groups have no choice but to play ball in the marketing arena.</p>
        <p>''Can we put a car onstage in the middle of 'The Nutcracker'?'' Mr. Weiss asked. ''No, we're not going to do that. But there is a lot of flexibility out there.''</p>
