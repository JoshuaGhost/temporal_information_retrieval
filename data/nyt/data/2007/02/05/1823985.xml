        <p>8 P.M. (Fox) PRISON BREAK -- Strangers on a train? No more, as Michael (Wentworth Miller) and Sara (Sarah Wayne Callies, right, with Mr. Miller) share a kiss en route to confront the president. Meanwhile, Mahone finds a new ally in his bid to capture he fugitives. And the Hollanders keep up appearances now that T-Bag -- that's Daddy to you -- is home.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (Lifetime) NORA ROBERTS'S MONTANA SKY -- Next up in the Lifetime quartet of movies based on Ms. Roberts's best-selling novels, this story about the three daughters of Jack Mercy, a millionaire cattleman, who must live on his enormous ranch for one year to collect their inheritance. Ashley Williams plays Willa, the daughter who calls the country home; Charlotte Ross is Tess, the one who can't wait to hightail it back to Hollywood. And John Corbett (above, with Ms. Williams) is Ben, the neighbor who supervises the Mercy ranch. Diane Ladd does a turn as Bess, the meddling Irish cook who tries to convince Willa and Ben that they belong together.</p>
        <p>9 P.M. (History) DIGGING FOR THE TRUTH -- Josh Bernstein travels to Egypt to the Valley of the Kings, where he climbs into King Tut's tomb, fires the weapons he took to his grave, and tries to figure out the mystery behind his death.</p>
        <p>9:30 P.M. (CBS) RULES OF ENGAGEMENT -- Boys and girls, playing together -- sometimes nicely, sometimes not. That's the premise of this new sitcom, starring Oliver Hudson and Bianca Kaljichas a newly engaged couple; Patrick Warburton and Megyn Price as an old married twosome, and perennial bachelor David Spade as a single man on the prowl.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (13, 49) AT CLOSE RANGE WITH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC -- Joel Sartore, a photographer with National Geographic, travels to some of the most exotic locations on Earth for his job, but his accommodations are hardly five-star, as he lives in wretched conditions for weeks on end just to get the shot -- during which he has been chased by bears, wolves, alligators and musk oxen. This special follows Mr. Sartore as he travels from the wilderness to the magazine's offices in Washington for perhaps the most difficult part of his job: winnowing down thousands of photographs into the 10 or 20 that typically accompany a story.</p>
        <p>10 P.M. (ABC) IN STYLE CELEBRITY WEDDINGS -- Desperate housewives? Probably not any time soon. This special goes behind the scenes of celebrity nuptials to watch lovebirds like Marcia Cross and Tom Mahoney (right), Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott, Avril Lavigne and Deryck Whibley, and Niki Taylor and Burney Lamar tie the knot for better or worse. Or at least for now.</p>
