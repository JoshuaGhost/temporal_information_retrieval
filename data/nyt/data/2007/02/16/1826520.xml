        <p>Arctic Monkeys and Killers Lead the Brit Awards</p>
        <p>The British rock band the Arctic Monkeys and the Killers, a Las Vegas-based group sometimes called the best British band to have come out of America, were the big winners on Wednesday in London at the Brit Awards, Britain's version of the Grammys, Reuters reported. (Above from left, David Keuning and Ronnie Vannucci of the Killers.) Each of the guitar-driven indie rock groups won two awards, beating out established names like Bob Dylan, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and the Flaming Lips. The Arctic Monkeys were honored as best British group and for having made the best British album. The accolades capped an eventful year for this band, whose first album became the fastest-selling debut ever in Britain. The Killers were cited for best international act and international album. Justin Timberlake won the international male solo artist award, and the Canadian pop singer Nelly Furtado was chosen best female solo artist.</p>
        <p>Wadsworth Atheneum Chief Resigns</p>
        <p>Willard Holmes announced his resignation yesterday after four years as director of the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford. Mr. Holmes, below, previously the chief operating officer and deputy director of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, made his announcement at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Atheneum's board. He agreed to remain indefinitely to assist in the transition to a new director. Among other considerations in his decision to step down, he said, were the completion of two goals. These were the refocusing of the museum on its collections and history and the establishment of a strategy for long-term sustainability of the museum.</p>
        <p>No Kidding: Milli Vanilli, the Movie</p>
        <p>Milli Vanilli will sing again. The pop duo that topped the charts before it was exposed as a fraud will be the subject of a film to be written for Universal Pictures by Jeff Nathanson, who rendered a sympathetic portrait of a con man with his screenplay for Steven Spielberg's ''Catch Me If You Can'' (2002), Variety.com reported. In case anyone has forgotten, Fabrice Morvan and Rob Pilatus were hired by the German producer Frank Farian to front Milli Vanilli, for which he had already recorded the voices of other singers. After the two men topped the charts and sold millions of records, Mr. Morvan and Mr. Pilatus refused to promote the second album unless Mr. Farian allowed them to sing. Instead he exposed the fraud. Their 1990 Grammy for best new artist was revoked, class-action lawsuits were filed, and Arista Records dropped Milli Vanilli. Mr. Pilatus became a drug abuser, served time for robbery and died of an overdose in 1998 before a reunion album could be released. ''I've always been fascinated by the notion of fakes and frauds,'' Mr. Nathanson said. ''But my intention is to tell this story from their point of view.''</p>
        <p>British Stars Go Begging</p>
        <p>Four British nominees for Academy Awards yesterday beseeched the British government, which is trying to cut spending, not to slash subsidies for theater, The Associated Press reported. Helen Mirren (''The Queen'') and Judi Dench (''Notes on a Scandal''), nominees for best actress, were joined in the appeal by Stephen Frears (''The Queen''), a contender for best director, and the screenwriter Patrick Marber (''Notes on a Scandal''). All said they would not have achieved success without their background in Britain's vibrant theater. ''The British subsidized theater is admired and envied throughout the world,'' Ms. Mirren said in a statement released by Nicholas Hytner, director of the National Theater, the country's largest subsidized stage company. Financing for the culture ministry for three years beginning in 2008 is to be announced by the Treasury within the next few months.</p>
        <p>Stoppard's 'Rock' Is Broadway Bound</p>
        <p>Sonia Friedman and Boyett Ostar Productions have confirmed that they will move the newest Tom Stoppard play, ''Rock 'n' Roll,'' a sold-out hit at the Royal Court Theater in London, to a Shubert theater on Broadway in October. Casting details have not been announced.  The Tony Award-winning actor John Glover will replace Bob Martin, the Tony Award-winning star and author of ''The Drowsy Chaperone,'' as the hit musical's Man in Chair. Mr. Glover, who won a Tony in 1995 for his performance in dual roles in Terrence McNally's ''Love! Valour! Compassion!,'' will join the cast in April. Mr. Martin will reprise his pivotal role in the West End production of ''The Drowsy Chaperone,'' beginning previews on May 14 at the Novello Theater in London.  Erika Mallin has been named executive director of the Signature Theater Company. Ms. Mallin, for the last two years the director of development at Atlantic Theater Company, succeeds Kathryn Lipuma, who is to join the Writers' Theater of Chicago next month as executive director.</p>
        <p>Hello Again, Elvis</p>
        <p>Prepare for Elvis sightings in Honolulu in July. To commemorate the 30th anniversary of his death, at Graceland on Aug 16, 1977, TV Land, a division of MTV Networks, has commissioned a life-size bronze statue of Presley to be unveiled in July in front of the Neal Blaisdell Center, site of his 1973 concert ''Elvis: Aloha From Hawaii,'' The Associated Press reported. The statue will depict Presley in his flare-legged, big-collared, bejeweled ensemble. Mayor Mufi Hannemann, left, a crooner who sang a Hawaii-theme medley at his inauguration, said: ''Elvis remains an idol and a hero to so many of us. And because of his time spent here, Hawaii considers him an adopted son.''</p>
        <p>Guards Strike Louvre</p>
        <p>Admission to the Louvre Museum in Paris, which attracted 8.3 million visitors last year, was free on Wednesday, at least for a while, as about 30 striking security guards blocked access to ticket booths, The Associated Press reported. The guards, seeking a pay raise, walked out on Friday, the Louvre said, adding that they represent less than 5 percent of the museum's 1,100 guards. Veronique Petitjean, a museum spokeswoman, said that because the walkout had ''few repercussions, workers decided to block the booths.'' But they eventually moved away, and the entrance fees were reinstated. The museum said that despite the strike, more than 90 percent of the galleries were open on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Loretta Lynn, 71, who came out of Butcher Hollow, Ky., to achieve fame as a country singer with hits including ''Coal Miner's Daughter'' and ''You Ain't Woman Enough,'' will be awarded an honorary doctor of music degree by Berklee College of Boston during a performance on March 17 at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, The Associated Press reported.  The British novelist Martin Amis, whose works include ''Money,'' ''Time's Arrow'' and ''The House of Meetings,'' has been appointed to his first teaching post, professor of creative writing at the University of Manchester in England.  Keith Olbermann has signed a new four-year contract with MSNBC. He will continue as the host of his nightly news program, ''Countdown With Keith Olbermann,'' contribute occasional essays to ''NBC Nightly News'' and will be the host of two ''Countdown'' prime-time specials yearly.</p>
