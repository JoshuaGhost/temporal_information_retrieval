        <p>Ceres  547 West 27th Street, Suite 201, Chelsea  Through Feb. 24</p>
        <p>In a gathering wave of feminist shows this season, ''Agents of Change: Women, Art and Intellect'' is a modest but timely arrival. Organized by the artist Leslie King-Hammond, dean of graduate studies at Maryland Institute College of Art, with an immaculate installation by Lowery Stokes Sims, former president of the Studio Museum in Harlem, it's a multiethnic, multigenerational selection of work by 19 artists spanning some 40 years. If there's a theme, it's a loose one: feminist art happened in many forms; it is still happening in many forms.</p>

        <p>Ceres  547 West 27th Street, Suite 201, Chelsea  Through Feb. 24</p>
        <p>In a gathering wave of feminist shows this season, ''Agents of Change: Women, Art and Intellect'' is a modest but timely arrival. Organized by the artist Leslie King-Hammond, dean of graduate studies at Maryland Institute College of Art, with an immaculate installation by Lowery Stokes Sims, former president of the Studio Museum in Harlem, it's a multiethnic, multigenerational selection of work by 19 artists spanning some 40 years. If there's a theme, it's a loose one: feminist art happened in many forms; it is still happening in many forms.</p>
        <p>The earliest piece is a 1963 painting by Faith Ringgold, ''American People Series: Between Two Friends,'' in which two women, one dark-skinned, one light-skinned, face each other across a solid vertical divide. It was way ahead of its time in pointing to a major rift, along racial lines, in organized feminist politics to come.</p>
        <p>Ana Mendieta's 1974 photographic series, ''Untitled (Body Print),'' mixes sexuality, violence and mortality in a moving and disturbing performance: these pictures could be about Iraq today. Nancy Grossman's ''Sketch for Double Tethered Figure'' from the same year paved the way for her extraordinary leather-bound sculptural heads, which blew conventional images of femininity to smithereens and helped open the door for younger artists like Laura Aguilar, Nicole Eisenman, Catherine Opie and Kara Walker.</p>
        <p>Many artists with roots in the 1970s are now doing their most ambitious work. One is Joyce Kozloff, who has been producing a multipart, installation-scale world history of war and colonialism. And, as always, artists are in communion with other artists: Miriam Schapiro channels Mary Cassatt; Lesley Dill draws on Emily Dickinson; Mimi Gross, in a life-size group portrait, gathers a roomful of female artists associated with the influential cultural critic Arlene Raven, who died last year and to whom the show is dedicated.</p>
        <p>Judging by appearances, most, if not all, of the women in the portrait are white. The old racial rift has not been bridged, and this reality demands concentrated attention and debate, starting now. The Ceres show, an initiative of the Feminist Art Project centered at Rutgers University, coincides with the annual meeting of the College Art Association in Manhattan this weekend. The conference has scheduled a series of panels on feminism, which will, presumably, address ethnicity, ''queerness'' and divide-to-conquer art marketing.</p>
        <p>Of course, art conceived from a feminist perspective has always tried to trip up the machinery of the academic art industry and raise a collective voice, in myriad ways only beginning to be defined. You'll find some evidence of this in the Ceres show; some more in ''Re:Generation,'' a survey of emerging female artists at Smack Mellon in Dumbo, Brooklyn (through March 11), and still more in ''What F Word?'' at Cynthia Broan Gallery in Chelsea (through March 17).</p>
        <p>Other shows are on the way, and be sure to check out the online journal M/E/A/N/I/N/G. Its new issue, ''Feminist Art: A Reassessment'' (writing.upenn.edu/pepc/meaning/04), asks many questions about the past, present and future that will surely shape discussion in this feminist year.</p>

        <p>Correction:  February 23, 2007, Friday  An art review in Weekend last Friday about ''Agents of Change: Women, Art and Intellect,'' at the Ceres Gallery in Chelsea, referred incompletely to a life-size group portrait by Mimi Gross. While some of the women depicted are artists, the portrait includes collectors and patrons who accompanied the critic Arlene Raven on tours of artists' studios. It is not a portrait of female artists associated with Ms. Raven.</p>
