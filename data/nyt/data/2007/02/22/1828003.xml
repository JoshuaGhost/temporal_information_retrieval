        <p>Judge Shira A Scheindlin refuses defense motion to throw out David Price and Ashoka Thomas's lawsuit claiming that Rawson Marshall Thurber's script for 2004 film Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story is so similar to one they wrote that it must have been copied; says humor and details of scripts are so close that jury should decide whether copyright has been infringed; Thomas and Price's script was based on Price's life in competitive dodgeball; photos (M)</p>

        <p>In a lot of ways, David Price is the struggling New York actor from central casting. He once had a role on the NBC show ''Ed,'' he said, but now he works as a nanny between auditions. He has to buy his trendy clothes in thrift stores. He is 30 and hopes his big break is around the corner.</p>
        <p>Once upon a time in Ohio, he tasted another kind of stardom, and it was sweet. He was a national amateur dodgeball champion. ''Dodgeball was my life,'' he said. ''You remember it being so fun and so simple. Yet so barbaric.''</p>

        <p>In a lot of ways, David Price is the struggling New York actor from central casting. He once had a role on the NBC show ''Ed,'' he said, but now he works as a nanny between auditions. He has to buy his trendy clothes in thrift stores. He is 30 and hopes his big break is around the corner.</p>
        <p>Once upon a time in Ohio, he tasted another kind of stardom, and it was sweet. He was a national amateur dodgeball champion. ''Dodgeball was my life,'' he said. ''You remember it being so fun and so simple. Yet so barbaric.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was not nearly so rough as the treacherous world of Hollywood, which Mr. Price says stole his movie idea and his screwball experiences as a dodgeball warrior. A federal judge this month set the stage for a classic show-business battle when she said a suit by Mr. Price and a writing partner could go to trial.</p>
        <p>The suit claims that the script of the 2004 hit movie ''Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story,'' starring Ben Stiller and Vince Vaughn, was so similar to one they wrote that it must have been copied. The judge, Shira A. Scheindlin of United States District Court in Manhattan, said some of the humor and other details were so similar that a jury should decide whether a copyright foul had been committed. She refused a motion to dismiss the suit filed by 20th Century Fox, which distributed the movie.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, the trial could offer a closer look at a game -- comedy writing -- that is not unlike the one portrayed in the two scripts. From a distance, both might seem like frivolous fun. Some teamwork. Sex jokes. Middle school toilet humor. Throwing stuff at one another. But get closer, and you may find thwarted ambition, humiliations. A stolen dream, perhaps, or a ball upside the head.</p>
        <p>Evidence gathered in the case, Judge Scheindlin wrote, showed that both scripts were tales of misfits who form underdog dodgeball teams with demented coaches in wheelchairs who die in freakish accidents, then come back as ghosts to give advice on how to win. Some characters had the same or similar names and characteristics.</p>
        <p>The judge wrote, for example, that Gordo, a character in the unmade script, and Gordon, a timid employee and teammate of Mr. Vaughn's in the 2004 movie, are both fat and have a flaw they must overcome to help the team defeat a team of bullies.</p>
        <p>Gordon, she wrote, must channel his anger while ''Gordo must overcome his fear of using other people's toilet paper.'' It may have been a while since a federal judge wrote a line like that.</p>
        <p>Rawson Marshall Thurber, the 32-year old Hollywood phenom who wrote and directed ''Dodgeball,'' is leading something like the life Mr. Price wants. He is currently finishing an adaptation of Michael Chabon's novel ''The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,'' again as writer and director.</p>
        <p>All of those sued, including Mr. Thurber, declined through a lawyer to comment. But in court papers they argued that Mr. Thurber began working on a dodgeball movie before Mr. Price and his friend, Ashoka Thomas, a scriptwriter and part-time bartender who is now 33. They said Mr. Thurber never saw the other script. One claim by the defense that may not help Mr. Thurber's résumé was that any similarities between the two scripts occurred because both relied on formulaic plot elements.</p>
        <p>The defense lawyers tried to give as good as they got. It was coincidence, they insisted, that both scripts said dodgeball was a major sport in China even though that is not true. And, they pointed out in lawyerspeak, ''the subplot in plaintiffs' screenplay about Gordo and his defecation obsession has no analogue in defendants' motion picture.'' Take that, Judge Scheindlin.</p>
        <p>But the judge did not seem to buy it. She said Mr. Price and Mr. Thomas were entitled to tell a jury their theory that Mr. Thurber may have gotten hold of their script. She noted that Mr. Price and Mr. Thomas finished their script at the end of March 2001. Mr. Thurber finished his draft in late April.</p>
        <p>Not long after Mr. Thomas finished the writing, with Mr. Price's frequent consultation as to dodgeball and other foolishness, Mr. Thomas gave a copy of their script to an agent's assistant with some ties to Mr. Thurber. There was some evidence, Judge Scheindlin wrote, that Mr. Thurber's burst of productivity may have occurred soon after, ''following months of writer's block and frustration.''</p>
        <p>Before ''Dodgeball,'' Mr. Thurber was best known for creating ''Terry Tate, Office Linebacker,'' a Reebok Super Bowl commercial in which a veteran pro football player tackled office workers who misused supplies. Mr. Thurber is a film school graduate who -- on rawsonthurber.com -- describes himself as a sports fanatic. He has said in interviews that he likes working with his own ideas, but that making movies can be difficult unless one is totally committed.</p>
        <p>''It's too hard,'' he told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in October. ''It really is, the actual act of writing and directing something, unless you are 1,000 percent desperately, dopey-eyed in love with it.''</p>
        <p>As far as Mr. Price is concerned, ''Dodgeball'' was his story and he kind of liked it.</p>
        <p>If it was not his story, it could have been.</p>
        <p>Back in Bexley, Ohio, in his early 20s, he was something of a pied piper of dodgeball. He was the force behind the Bexley Reckers, consisting of himself, two of his five brothers and assorted volunteers and draftees with a fan base large enough to get up a caravan of at least five cars.</p>
        <p>In 2000 and 2001, they went to the national dodgeball championships in the Chicago area and cleaned up.</p>
        <p>Which is memorable, his brother Michael said, not just because of their athletic prowess, but also because they were known for weird and nutty garb, like Speedos and midriff T-shirts. David would lead the team in an antic dance, which had a disarming effect on opponents.</p>
        <p>''It involved a flailing of arms and legs,'' Michael C. Price said. ''He'd come up with these ideas and we'd go for it.''</p>
        <p>By the winter of 2001, Mr. Price had the acting bug. A high school and college actor with jet-black hair and a slender build, he had already starred in a low-budget movie, ''Raw Fish,'' made by Mr. Thomas. It involved some college boys in a contest to get a role with an adult movie star. Mr. Price said he believed it might have been distributed on DVD. Perhaps in some foreign countries, he said.</p>
        <p>With that project under his belt, Mr. Price said, the hilarity potential of the dodgeball tournament was obvious. ''Seeing an overweight guy get hit in the face and falling over, that is funny, in my opinion,'' he said in the Manhattan office of his lawyer, Guy Cohen.</p>
        <p>Sure, he was into the sport, Mr. Price said. And there was strategy: ''They thought we were just a bunch of skinny punks. Which we were. But we were skinny punks who could throw a ball really hard.''</p>
        <p>The whole act would produce apoplexy among their competitors. Many of their opponents tended to be dressed in everyday athletic clothes ''like a normal person would wear,'' Mr. Price said. Their competition played with a seriousness that could be alarming.</p>
        <p>It was material.</p>
        <p>As soon as he got back from Chicago, he started in on Mr. Thomas, showing him tapes and describing absurdity that seemed made for the big screen. Soon, they had a plan. Mr. Thomas would draft the script with Mr. Price's input. Mr. Price would star.</p>
        <p>By phone from Argentina, where he is living this winter, Mr. Thomas said that Mr. Price is a likable John Cusack-type with a streak of Conan O'Brien. Their script, ''Dodgeball: The Movie,'' was Mr. Price's story. It was ''his life, extremely exaggerated,'' Mr. Thomas said, ''and then throw in all this other stuff.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Mr. Price and Mr. Thurber met once. It was at a dodgeball tournament, after the movie starring Mr. Stiller and Mr. Vaughn had been green-lighted. Mr. Price was disappointed, knowing there was no room for two dodgeball movies. He did not yet know about the similarities. The two men talked at courtside, Mr. Price recalled. They were a lot alike, he said.</p>
        <p>''I remember saying, 'Keep a part open for me,' '' Mr. Price said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thurber didn't.</p>
        <p>The two now seem likely to meet again. In a different court.</p>
