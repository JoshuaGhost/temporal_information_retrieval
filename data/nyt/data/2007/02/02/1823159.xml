        <p>If Paolo Nutini had a prettier voice, he'd be intolerable. He is a doe-eyed, full-lipped, tousle-haired songwriter from Paisley, Scotland, who just turned 20. He strums an acoustic guitar and sings about what matters most to a teenage boy: romance and lust, with an occasional glimpse of a young man's growing pains.</p>
        <p>He revels in pleasure and suffers over breakups; he's eager but not aggressive, and properly grateful when things work out. ''When you're loving me, I'm loving you/I love the prowess in the things that you do,'' he sang on Wednesday night at the Bowery Ballroom, which was filled with squealing young women. Mr. Nutini's new album, ''These Streets'' (Atlantic), was released here on Jan. 30, but appeared last year in Britain, where it reached the Top 10.</p>

        <p>If Paolo Nutini had a prettier voice, he'd be intolerable. He is a doe-eyed, full-lipped, tousle-haired songwriter from Paisley, Scotland, who just turned 20. He strums an acoustic guitar and sings about what matters most to a teenage boy: romance and lust, with an occasional glimpse of a young man's growing pains.</p>
        <p>He revels in pleasure and suffers over breakups; he's eager but not aggressive, and properly grateful when things work out. ''When you're loving me, I'm loving you/I love the prowess in the things that you do,'' he sang on Wednesday night at the Bowery Ballroom, which was filled with squealing young women. Mr. Nutini's new album, ''These Streets'' (Atlantic), was released here on Jan. 30, but appeared last year in Britain, where it reached the Top 10.</p>
        <p>Luckily, Mr. Nutini's voice doesn't simper. It's cracked and raspy, with the edge of David Gray, the quavers of Jeff Buckley and a streak of the blues. His phrasing is elastic and unpredictable; he jumps into lines after the beat and stretches them with syncopated moans. He doesn't sound as if he's wheedling or complaining, even when he is; in ''Jenny Don't Be Hasty,'' he tries to persuade an older woman not to ''treat me like a baby.'' Instead, the songs take on a precocious gravity.</p>
        <p>Onstage he was almost introverted. When he wasn't playing guitar, he hunched over, as if looking at his feet, or turned toward his musicians, or faced the audience with his eyes closed. But his voice wasn't shy. It romped above the band's well-timed buildups with all the confidence his posture lacked.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nutini's songs are straightforward. In ''Rewind'' he sang about wishing he could rewind a romance back before it ended; in ''These Streets'' he sang about moving to a big city; in ''New Shoes'' he sang about the confidence a pair of new shoes gave him. (He's probably already gotten offers to license it for footwear commercials.) His music looks not only toward John Mayer and Dave Matthews, but also back to the folk-rock and singer-songwriters of the 1960s and 70s. In midset Mr. Nutini sang Fred Neil's ''Dolphins,'' which had been recorded by Tim Buckley, Jeff's father.</p>
        <p>During ''Last Request,'' a hit in Great Britain about a couple's last night together, Mr. Nutini cut the band back to a drumbeat and let the audience sing the chorus. Women's voices filled the club, singing, ''Let's go there, lay down beside me.'' How long can Mr. Nutini keep up that image as a lonely, sensitive guy?</p>
