        <p>Clarence Norman Jr.'s former second-in-command in the Brooklyn Democratic Party testified yesterday that he saw his boss angrily threaten to withhold support for a judge on his ticket in 2002 if she refused to pay for fliers designed by the party's favored vendor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Norman, in the fourth corruption trial against him in two years, is accused of strong-arming two judicial candidates into paying his cronies thousands of dollars. His former lieutenant, Jeffrey Feldman, the party's longtime executive director, was originally charged along with Mr. Norman, but charges against him were dropped when he agreed to testify for prosecutors.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Feldman filled in details of the complex and costly process of mounting a multicandidate campaign, though, a portrait began to emerge of Mr. Norman as a frustrated commander trying to bully some semblance of discipline into his wayward troops. Over the course of daylong testimony in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, the line between hardball business negotiations and illegal acts of coercion began to seem a bit blurry.</p>
        <p>Under cross-examination by one of Mr. Norman's lawyers, Edward D. Wilford, Mr. Feldman depicted one of the judges, Karen B. Yellen, as refusing to commit to the party's spending plan even as she began to reap the benefits of the party's field efforts during the campaign.</p>
        <p>And he spelled out the difficulty that Mr. Norman would have had actually following through on his threat to cut support to the candidates on Primary Day.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilford displayed a ''palm card,'' one of 200,000 cards party workers handed out to Brooklyn voters on their way in to the polls that day, listing the party's choices for eight offices. The two judicial candidates were listed in the middle of the card. Mr. Feldman conceded it would have been hard to remove only their names from the cards. ''Someone could take a Magic Marker to them'' he said, suppressing a smile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilford asked, ''But it would take a lot of effort to do that to 200,000 cards, and a lot of time, wouldn't it?'' Mr. Feldman agreed.</p>
        <p>In the Civil Court primary, Judge Yellen, an incumbent, and the other candidate Mr. Norman is accused of coercing, Judge Marcia J. Sikowitz of Housing Court, ended up losing to upstarts who ran against the machine.</p>
        <p>The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, has spent several years prosecuting Mr. Norman, a former 12-term state assemblyman, as part of an inquiry into allegations that the Brooklyn Democratic Party's endorsement of judicial candidates was for sale. He has won convictions on charges that Mr. Norman solicited illegal contributions and pocketed campaign funds, for which Mr. Norman faces two to six years in prison. He was acquitted of billing the Assembly for mileage on his car.</p>
        <p>The strong-arming charges are the closest Mr. Hynes has come to charging Mr. Norman with selling spots on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say Mr. Norman, after handing the party endorsement to two judicial candidates for Civil Court, then imposed conditions on his continued support. He insisted, prosecutors said, that the candidates pay for joint campaign fliers designed by a printer, Ernest Lendler, and, just days before the primary, that Judge Yellen pay a longtime associate of Mr. Norman's, William H. Boone III, $9,000 for get-out-the-vote efforts on Primary Day in the mostly black districts of central Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors say the judges questioned the wisdom of running a joint campaign and wanted to design their own literature. Judge Yellen, they said, wanted to use her own workers rather than pay for Mr. Boone's in some districts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feldman testified that in a meeting at party headquarters in July 2002, six weeks before the primary, Mr. Norman became enraged at a consultant, Scott Levenson, who was hired by Judge Yellen. The consultant kept asking Mr. Norman what would happen if Judge Yellen simply declined to pay for the joint mailing campaign.</p>
        <p>''He stood up,'' Mr. Feldman said, ''and he said to the effect that 'At the end of the day, if you don't agree to this, you're not going to have any support in this county, your candidate's not going to have any support in this county, and your candidate's going to be dumped.' ''</p>
        <p>The threat worked, Mr. Feldman said. ''It got quiet very quickly,'' he said. ''An agreement was formulated within a matter of seconds.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 26, 2007, Monday  An article on Feb. 3 about the corruption trial of Clarence Norman Jr., the former assemblyman and Brooklyn Democratic Party leader, misstated the profession of Ernest Lendler, who designed a campaign flier for a judge who ran on the party's ticket during the 2002 primary. Mr. Lendler is a political consultant, not a printer. (The error first appeared in an article on Jan. 24 that referred to Mr. Lendler without naming him, and was repeated on Feb. 2 in an article about the trial.)</p>
        <p>An article on Nov. 18, 2003, about the indictment of Mr. Norman referred incorrectly to Mr. Lendler's company, Branford Communications. It is a political consulting firm, not a printing company.</p>
