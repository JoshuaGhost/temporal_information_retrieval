        <p>Steve Swindal, the general partner of the Yankees and the son-in-law of the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, said Monday that Steinbrenner had been supportive since he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence last Thursday in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>

        <p>Steve Swindal, the general partner of the Yankees and the son-in-law of the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, said Monday that Steinbrenner had been supportive since he was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence last Thursday in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
        <p>While Swindal declined to discuss specifics about the arrest, he expressed remorse for embarrassing his family, the Yankees and their fans. Swindal said that Steinbrenner had been a great father-in-law; Swindal has been married for 23 years to Steinbrenner's daughter Jennifer.</p>
        <p>''He supports me,'' Swindal said. ''I don't feel anything but a guy who is looking out after me and supports me.''</p>
        <p>When Swindal was asked if his status with the Yankees had changed since the incident, he said, ''Hopefully not,'' and laughed nervously. When Swindal was asked if Steinbrenner still considered him the heir apparent to run the Yankees, he was also brief.</p>
        <p>''I can't answer that,'' Swindal said. ''I think it would be speculation. I can only address, on a family level, that he's certainly supportive.''</p>
        <p>Wearing a blue jacket, a white polo shirt and tan chinos, Swindal held an impromptu news conference in the press box at Legends Field. A few hours after Alex Rodriguez made lively comments about his relationship with Derek Jeter and created a tantalizing news story, Swindal decided to address reporters. The Yankees alerted the news media a few minutes before Swindal spoke.</p>
        <p>''I know you have a job to do and I didn't want you to have to chase me,'' Swindal said.</p>
        <p>Howard Rubenstein, Steinbrenner's spokesman, said Steinbrenner would not comment about Swindal until the legal matter had been resolved.</p>
        <p>Swindal, 52, was driving his 2007 Mercedes in St. Petersburg when he made a left turn in front of a police vehicle early Thursday morning, according to Bill Proffitt, the public information officer for the St. Petersburg police. Proffitt said the officer in the vehicle, Terri Nagel, had to brake to avoid a collision.</p>
        <p>Proffitt said Swindal was driving 61 miles an hour in a 35-m.p.h. zone at one point. Nagel stopped Swindal's car at 2:12 a.m.. Proffitt said Swindal failed a field sobriety test and was arrested. Swindal, who refused a Breathalyzer test, was taken to a jail in Largo, booked at 4:26 a.m. and released on a bond of $250 at 9:53 a.m.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, in the arresting officer's mind, he was under the influence,'' Proffitt said.</p>
        <p>Kym Rivellini, Swindal's lawyer, said Swindal, who lives in Tampa, was driving to his boat to sleep. Swindal was arrested about 40 blocks from the marina.</p>
        <p>Swindal, who has a date in Pinellas County traffic court on March 15 at 8:30 a.m., made his first appearance at Legends Field since the arrest. When Swindal was asked if the incident caused him to make any personal changes, he would not comment.</p>
        <p>Swindal said he wanted to return to work and avoid being a distraction.</p>
        <p>''I'm here for the duration,'' he said.</p>
