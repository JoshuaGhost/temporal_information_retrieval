        <p>Four former Mamaroneck police officers will split $2 million as part of an agreement with village officials to settle a federal lawsuit stemming from accusations of corruption within the department.</p>
        <p>The Board of Trustees voted 3 to 2 earlier this month in favor of the settlement and 4 to 1 in favor of a $1.5 million bond to pay for it. The remaining $500,000 will come from the village's insurance carrier.</p>
        <p>The settlement brings to an end years of controversy within the department that began with a simple drunken driving arrest in 2003. Insubordination hearings involving the officers followed and brought out allegations of sexual misconduct, ticket fixing and cover-ups within the department.</p>
        <p>''The village decided to settle based upon the advice of our attorney that if we had gone to trial there was substantial risk we would not prevail,'' said Tom Murphy, president of the village Board of Trustees.</p>
        <p>The former officers' lawsuit alleged that their First Amendment rights had been violated when they were brought up on disciplinary charges and punished by the department after stepping forward with allegations of corruption.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed on behalf of three former officers, John DiCioccio, Paul Micalizzi and Jeremy Skehan, and a former sergeant, Peter Monachelli. As part of the settlement, the four agreed to drop all litigation against the village and not to seek reinstatement.</p>
        <p>''If we hadn't put this behind us, it would have meant years and years of litigation,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''There would have been weeks of trial in federal court that would have been extremely bad publicity for the village.''</p>
        <p>Jonathan Lovett, a lawyer for the former officers, said they had no comment.</p>
