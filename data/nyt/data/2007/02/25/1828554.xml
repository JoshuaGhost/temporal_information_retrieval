        <p>VIEWS are a relatively modern travel discovery. Granted, much of the stuff they are made of has very likely been there awhile, but historically speaking, one stopped at the inn to get off the congested and foul-smelling streets, not to look out at them.</p>
        <p>It took the French to show us that cities -- their cities anyway -- were worth ogling. First, Baron Haussmann prettied up Paris, and then Eiffel built his tower from which to look out over it. Pissarro and Sisley took to painting the views from their studios, and photographers like Eugène Atget and Alfred Stieglitz showed us that our modern cities weren't ugly ducklings after all. And as with almost any aesthetic innovation out of Paris, the Japanese have taken the ball and run with it up to the 50th floor.</p>

        <p>VIEWS are a relatively modern travel discovery. Granted, much of the stuff they are made of has very likely been there awhile, but historically speaking, one stopped at the inn to get off the congested and foul-smelling streets, not to look out at them.</p>
        <p>It took the French to show us that cities -- their cities anyway -- were worth ogling. First, Baron Haussmann prettied up Paris, and then Eiffel built his tower from which to look out over it. Pissarro and Sisley took to painting the views from their studios, and photographers like Eugène Atget and Alfred Stieglitz showed us that our modern cities weren't ugly ducklings after all. And as with almost any aesthetic innovation out of Paris, the Japanese have taken the ball and run with it up to the 50th floor.</p>
        <p>But now that we've accepted the charm of traffic lights and neon, how to find the best face a city puts forward? At many hotels, the best views have been commandeered by upper-category rooms, but almost every property has a few standard rooms with views, so it's a question of knowing -- or asking -- when you book. Hotel reservation agents and sales directors can be surprisingly candid in assessing the value of their vistas.</p>
        <p>ROME</p>
        <p>With seven hills, Rome ought to offer some spectacular vistas, and the city does not disappoint those with a penchant for sun-drenched rooftop gardens and horizons of domes and spires. The best lookout is most likely in the grand Hotel Hassler (Piazza Trinita del Monte, 6; 39-06-69-93-40; www.hotelhasslerroma.com) at the top of the Spanish Steps. The luxuriously paneled and tapestry-hung suites like the San Pietro offer the most panoramic views for 2,950 euros a night (nearly $4,000 at $1.33 to the euro). There are several ''classic'' rooms with similar vistas and one deluxe room, 506, which for 710 euros has a balcony over the Piazza di Spagna, offering a big-eyed peek at the skyline, from the marble Victor Emmanuel monument to the domes of the Pantheon and St. Peter's. Rooms like 720 (2,300 euros) peer into the Borghese Gardens and the Villa Medici. Next door, Room 718, a single, costs 460 euros.</p>
        <p>For those who like history at closer range, there is the Hotel Forum (Via Tor de' Conti, 25-30; 39-06-679-24-46; www.hotelforumrome.com; rooms with a view from 350 euros). The lobby reads old-world pensione with marble floors, creaking staircases and fringed swags galore. More than a dozen rooms overlook the Roman forum, with its parade of columns and arches.</p>
        <p>PARIS</p>
        <p>Paris's prized views are more about the city's refined urban context, where even a courtyard view is inspiring. For those with deep pockets, one of the five penthouse suites at the Hôtel de Crillon (10, Place de la Concorde; 33-1-44-71-15-00; www.crillon.com), overlooking the Place de la Concorde, is the ideal. The Bernstein Suite is perhaps the most dramatic, with its slightly lowered ceiling adding to the drama of stepping out onto its terraces from which one recent female guest commented, ''You feel like you own Paris.'' Marie-Antoinette did own Paris, and she came to the Crillon for her piano lessons. As you scan the view of the Egyptian obelisk, the giddy fountains of the Place (where the French queen later lost her head), and beyond to the Pont de la Concorde, the Musée d'Orsay, the Tuileries Gardens, the Beaux-Arts glass roof of the Grand Palais and the Eiffel Tower, issues of ownership seem irrelevant. All you'll need is 8,200 euros. Regrettably, there are no standard rooms that deliver such an eyeful.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, other hotels offer commanding views. At the elegant Hôtel Pont Royal (7, rue de Montalembert; 33-1-42-84-70-00; www.hotel-pont-royal.com; from 380 euros) in St.-Germain-des-Prés, the windows of at least 10 rooms on Floors 6 and 7 frame the city's most romantic images like Impressionist canvases. Room 605 is one such chamber: to the west you see the Eiffel Tower and to the north Sacré-Coeur.</p>
        <p>VIENNA</p>
        <p>Vienna's grandest hotels, like the Imperial and Bristol, offer enough gilded, overstuffed splendor that you may never draw the curtains back and look out at the city's architectural pomp and glory. But a few modern additions allow you to get above the action. The recently opened DO &amp; CO Hotel (Stephansplatz 12; 43-1-24-188-444; www.doco.com; 350 euros for a city-view room) provides a heavenly perch above the city's 12th-century St. Stephen's Cathedral. The hotel is owned by the Istanbul-born entrepreneur Attila Dogudan, and the cozy rooms have a Turkish accent -- dark wood, low-slung sofas and kilims. Many of the new sixth- and seventh-floor rooms at the Hotel Sacher (Philharmonikerstrasse 4; 43-1-51-456-0; www.sacher.com) feature balconies overlooking grand edifices like the Opera and the Albertina museum. Most of these rooms are suites (from about 850 to 2,500 euros), but there are a few rooms for around 555 euros that feature a slice of the same imperial splendor.</p>
        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>As befits the most famous of high-rise cities, New York City has many rooms with a view -- especially those of the High Gotham variety like the Four Seasons and the St. Regis, to name but a few. Others, like the Pierre and the Mandarin Oriental, sell their pastoral Central Park vistas as if they were gold. But in a classic New York story, a downtown upstart is giving the uptown dowagers a run for their money. The 22-story Hotel on Rivington (107 Rivington Street; 212-475-2600; www.hotelonrivington.com; doubles with unimpeded views from $425) on the Lower East Side is removed enough from Midtown's concrete jungle to let you take in the whole sweep of the city, from the Woolworth Building downtown past the Empire State Building and up to the towers of the George Washington Bridge, best viewed from the three-story penthouse. With its minimalist design and floor-to-ceiling views, it has become an obvious choice for fashion photo shoots, especially the spacious Room 185 on the 18th floor, from which one can watch the city that never sleeps while soaking in the free-standing tub.</p>
        <p>TOKYO</p>
        <p>Speaking of soaking up Japanese ambience, no sound stage could have provided the flickering-neon Tokyo backdrop of Sofia Coppola's ''Lost in Translation.'' The vertiginous views from Tokyo's Park Hyatt (3-7-1-2 Nishi Shinjuku; 81-3-5322-1234; www.parkhyatt.com), which occupies Floors 41 through 52 of the three graduated towers designed by Kenzo Tange that rise above the Shinjuku neighborhood, were for many the real star of the film. The hotel's New York Grill on the 52nd floor seems to float above the video-game street life buzzing below. Bill Murray's suite will set you back about $3,000 a night, but a park-facing room looking toward Mount Fuji can be nabbed for $500. The Mandarin Oriental (2-1-1 Nihonbashi Muromachi; 81-3-3270-8800; www.mandarinoriental.com) hovers over the livelier Ginza district, so you can save on cab fare and upgrade to a higher floor.</p>
