        <p>THE ETHICS OF IDENTITY, by Kwame Anthony Appiah. (Princeton University, $19.95.) This elegant, discerning book explores the scope and limits of individual and group rights as they relate to the hot-button controversies of our time: affirmative action, gay marriage, the human rights movement, even the teaching of evolution in the public schools. Drawing on John Stuart Mill's classic essay, ''On Liberty,'' Appiah, a Princeton philosopher, argues for a ''rooted cosmopolitanism,'' emphasizing the individual while recognizing the importance of collective identities based on race, religion, language and sexual preference. Appiah's examples range from the proceedings of the Pueblo tribal council to the experience of his own multicontinental family. ''To read 'The Ethics of Identity' is to enter into the world it describes; it is also to imagine what it might be like to live in so urbane and expansive a place,'' Jonathan Freedman wrote in the Book Review.</p>
        <p>THE MAKING OF A WRITER: Journals, 1961-1963, by Gail Godwin. Edited by Rob Neufeld. (Random House, $16.95.) In 1961, at the age of 24, Godwin fled America for Europe, seeking distance from a failed marriage and a failed job as a cub reporter for The Miami Herald. This revealing journal chronicles her fierce urge to be a writer and her desire to distract herself from this mission with any man who catches her eye. In her more than loosely autobiographical novel, QUEEN OF THE UNDERWORLD (Ballantine, $14.95), Godwin, a three-time National Book Award nominee, highlights the brief but turbulent career of a young woman at a Miami newspaper. Emma Gant (Godwin's alter ego) makes her way through a landscape populated by hard-boiled editors, gangsters, Cuban exiles and the former madam of an elite island whorehouse.</p>
        <p>MUSSOLINI'S ITALY: Life Under the Fascist Dictatorship, 1915-1945, by R. J. B. Bosworth. (Penguin, $20.) An Australian historian, Bosworth is the author of a 2002 biography of Benito Mussolini that was acclaimed as perhaps the best yet written. This absorbing follow-up traces the political and intellectual roots of Fascism and its impact on Italian society.</p>
        <p>TWILIGHT OF THE SUPERHEROES, by Deborah Eisenberg. (Picador, $14.) Eisenberg's stunning collection of stories -- her fifth in 20 years -- peers into the lives of well-meaning people, homing in on unforeseen developments, familial dissolution and heartbreak. The title story involves a group of friends in New York City who face an uncertain future before and after 9/11. ''Eisenberg has given us these remarkable stories,'' our reviewer, Ben Marcus, wrote, ''machines of perfect revelation deftly constructed by a contemporary master.''</p>
        <p>THE ROAD TO REALITY: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, by Roger Penrose. (Vintage, $25.) Starting from scratch with Pythagoras and Plato, and progressing to esoteric topics like hyperbolic geometry and string theory, Penrose, an Oxford physicist and the author of ''The Emperor's New Mind,'' dismantles what is known about the connection between mathematics and the physical world and then puts it back together again.</p>
        <p>BECOMING STRANGERS, by Louise Dean. (Harvest/Harcourt, $14.) A luxury vacation is no picnic for the two couples at the center of Dean's impressive debut novel. Jan, a middle-aged man battling terminal cancer, visits a Caribbean resort with his wife in search of some kind of closure to their tumultuous marriage, while Dorothy and George, after 55 years together, seek simple relaxation.</p>
        <p>GIRLS OF TENDER AGE: A Memoir, by Mary-Ann Tirone Smith. (Free Press, $14.) Smith's sensitive and witty memoir splices a portrait of her 1950s childhood in blue-collar Hartford into the story of a violent sexual predator who wound up in her placid community.</p>
        <p>AFTERLANDS, by Steven Heighton. (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) In his ambitious second novel, Heighton fictionalizes the story</p>
        <p>of the disastrous Polaris expedition, an 1871 exploration of the Arctic led by the American Charles Francis Hall. During a storm, 19 people become separated from the ship, cast adrift on a large ice floe. At the center of the drama lies Lt. George Tyson, the ineffectual ranking officer, and several German crew members, including the ship's meteorologist, Frederick Meyer, who whips up a nationalist mutiny. Heighton extrapolates from historical accounts of the crew's six-and-a-half-month journey, creating a ''sophisticated, densely layered fictional exploration of survival, love, betrayal and the personal cost of history,'' Bruce Barcott wrote here.</p>
        <p>PHYSICAL: An American Checkup, by James McManus. (Picador, $14.) McManus, who plunged into the world of high-stakes poker in ''Positively Fifth Street,'' now reckons with the nation's health care system and baby boomers' looming decline while undergoing a very thorough examination at the Mayo Clinic.</p>
