        <p>Xander Harrison, 4, an American living in Andorra, talks about his favorite things on a weeklong cruise (with additional commentary from his mother, Laurie Harrison). 1. ''Getting cookies and chocolate milk. Big cookies.'' (''I don't know if it was him or my husband, but they discovered they could get free room service, and that included milk and oatmeal cookies in the evening.'') 2. ''The chipmunks. It was really funny.'' (''Chip 'n Dale. They're his favorites. They dressed up as pirates and came over and saw us at the breakfast table.'') 3. ''The swimming pool. My friend was chasing me. He's Casey.'' (''He was with his godmother and her son, Casey Patti, from Portland, Ore. We got together for the cruise, which was wonderful.'') 4. ''Making Flubber. I liked the glue.'' (''It's the green stuff from this movie with Robin Williams. He thought it was really fun. I'm surprised they let us off the boat with it onto U.S. soil.'')</p>
