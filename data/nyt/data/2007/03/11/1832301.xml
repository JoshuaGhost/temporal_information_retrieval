        <p>Re ''Without Health Benefits, a Good Life Turns Fragile'' (front page, March 5):</p>
        <p>I am the medical director of a small program that focuses on uninsured and medically fragile patients. Most of my patients are impoverished. Those who are not are struggling. Some used to be what we refer to as middle-class.</p>
        <p>When I ask, ''What is your most pressing problem?,'' I am invariably told that it is lack of money. The illnesses come second.</p>
        <p>My patients cannot afford their medications or the co-payments for doctor visits and tests. They pick and choose among their options, and some do not choose wisely. I work with a social worker, an assistant case manager and a mental health counselor to try to repair the lives of these individuals and their families, and arrange things so that they do not have to make these choices.</p>
        <p>I am fortunate to be working for an organization that is committed to this goal. I would like to think that we, as a society, are committed to this goal.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In theory, those of us who are healthy today are supposed to subsidize the care of those who are sick, spreading both the cost and the risk among large groups of people. But when health insurers refuse to cover those who are ill, because they cost too much and pose a financial risk to the health insurer, the foundation upon which the American health care system is built is broken.</p>
        <p>If health insurance companies do not want to cover those who need insurance the most, lawmakers should seriously consider whether insurance companies should still have a role in our ailing health care system.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>My son receives health benefits through Medicaid because he has hypotonia, a neurological disorder that weakens motor muscles. His case is extremely mild. After six months of weekly physical therapy, his physical therapist discharged him, confirming that she could not foresee any long-term difficulties.</p>
        <p>Despite this, and the fact that he has never had a day's illness in his four years, he is considered uninsurable by the main health insurance providers.</p>
        <p>Kate Brophy  Venice, Fla., March 5, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>All the reasons cited for the high cost of health insurance boil down to this: most health insurance is ensconced in the private, profit-making sector instead of in the public domain, where it should be. As long as profit-making is the dominant goal (as it must be in any private business), the millions who are not able to afford coverage will continue to suffer.</p>
        <p>We would do better to follow the lead of other industrial countries, like Britain and Canada, which understand that profit must not be the prime aim of public health care.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about Vicki H. Readling, a woman from North Carolina who is unable to obtain health insurance because of a previous cancer diagnosis, comes as no surprise. With 47 million uninsured Americans, this is a deep-rooted problem in every state. However, more than 30 states have taken steps to help by establishing high-risk insurance pools.</p>
        <p>A bill now being considered in the North Carolina Legislature would create such a pool. It would give Ms. Readling and others like her a way to buy health insurance at about 150 percent of the average price for an individual policy in the state.</p>
        <p>It's certainly not the silver bullet that will do away with the 47 million uninsured all at once, but it is a big step in the right direction.</p>
        <p>Wayne Nelson  President  Communicating for America  Bloomington, Minn., March 6, 2007</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Like Vicki H. Readling, I find myself unable to obtain health insurance. But let's remember that some of the uninsured are ''cash'' patients. We often pay much higher prices than the insurers pay.</p>
        <p>So those of us who are uninsured but can pay are subsidizing medical care for those with insurance as well as for those without insurance who cannot pay.</p>
