        <p>The snow-dusted mesas and million-dollar adobes look enchanting as ever, but the political landscape here has shifted sharply since the Justice Department ousted a onetime Republican darling as United States attorney in New Mexico after party loyalists complained that he was not tough enough on crooked Democrats.</p>
        <p>David C. Iglesias is the man out of a job. But political experts here are also assessing the damage to New Mexico's two most powerful Republicans, Representative Heather A. Wilson, who won a re-election squeaker on an ethics platform in November, and the state's six-term senior senator, Pete V. Domenici, Mr. Iglesias's original champion and the man New Mexicans often call St. Pete.</p>
        <p>Both politicians called Mr. Iglesias in late October asking about pending corruption indictments long reported to involve at least one influential Democrat. Some top Republicans here say they urged Mr. Domenici and Ms. Wilson to act after years of complaints about Mr. Iglesias's performance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iglesias says that he interpreted the calls from Mr. Domenici and Ms. Wilson as improper political pressure and that his resistance ultimately cost him his job. The Justice Department dismissed Mr. Iglesias and seven other federal prosecutors in December in what Congressional critics call a political purge by the Bush administration.</p>
        <p>''It's given the public a look under the halo of St. Pete,'' said Randi McGinn, a Democratic lawyer in Albuquerque with a client in the widely discussed corruption investigation underlying the uproar over Mr. Iglesias.</p>
        <p>Mr. Domenici has apologized, saying he was not seeking to intimidate Mr. Iglesias. The senator did not respond to requests for an interview.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilson, after first declining to confirm her own call to Mr. Iglesias, conceded that she had made it but denied trying to pressure the prosecutor. She also declined to be interviewed.</p>
        <p>The consequences are yet to be determined. ''It's like pre-earthquake and post-earthquake,'' said Joe Monahan, a widely read New Mexico political blogger. ''A lot of the same buildings will be standing, but not all of them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Iglesias, 49, whose good looks, evangelical upbringing and Hispanic heritage once made him a rising star in New Mexico state politics, has not gone quietly. And his testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee this week seemed a reminder of his past as one of the Navy lawyers whose defense in a military hazing case helped provide the inspiration for the character played by Tom Cruise in the movie ''A Few Good Men.''</p>
        <p>''I still feel loyalty to the Republican Party, but I feel a greater sense of loyalty to the truth,'' Mr. Iglesias said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>He said he had been guided by a personal admonition from former Attorney General John Ashcroft shortly after he was appointed in 2001. ''He took me into his office and said, 'David, when you come here, you've got to stay out of politics.' ''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Iglesias finds himself at the center of the latest political storm to rock New Mexico, just as the Legislature winds down the frenzied last days of its session, Gov. Bill Richardson is in the throes of a presidential campaign and Santa Fe is preparing for the arrival of its newest celebrity immigrants, Valerie Wilson, the outed undercover C.I.A. operative, and her husband, the former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV.</p>
        <p>It has opened deep fault lines in this proudly proclaimed ''Land of Enchantment,'' where politics has been so exquisitely balanced that the Democratic-majority electorate chose Republicans for its Congressional delegation in Washington, crossover Republican voters helped send a Democratic governor to the statehouse and major elections have often been decided by a handful of votes.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Domenici and Ms. Wilson under fire in Washington, and the possibility of a federal ethics inquiry, prominent state Republicans say they were the ones who urged their Congressional delegates to take action against Mr. Iglesias. Indeed, he had long been a source of frustration for top New Mexico Republicans, who accused him of failing to lead the state out of a morass of public corruption cases, which lately have involved Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Iglesias says he moved as swiftly as the evidence permitted.</p>
        <p>Ms. McGinn, the Democratic lawyer, called Mr. Iglesias ''a profile in courage'' for speaking out against political pressures.</p>
        <p>The bitterness dates back to Mr. Iglesias's handling of election fraud complaints in 2004, which did not result in charges. Republicans also faulted him for what they called his office's anemic prosecution of the biggest political scandal to sweep New Mexico in years: a kickback scheme implicating a state treasurer at the time and his predecessor, both Democrats.</p>
        <p>And state Republicans have been increasingly impatient over a lack of long-anticipated indictments regarding an investigation into possible payoffs for the construction of an Albuquerque courthouse, an inquiry that reportedly involves the former president pro tem of the State Senate, Manny Aragon, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''I fall into the category of those who were ultimately very disappointed in David,'' said Pat Rogers, a Republican lawyer in Albuquerque who has represented Mr. Iglesias, Ms. Wilson and the State Republican Party.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers said he spoke with Mr. Iglesias at a private lunch last October in Albuquerque to discuss the perception that he was not pursuing indictments in the courthouse corruption inquiry expeditiously.</p>
        <p>''I asked him, 'Do you understand that everyone in this community is talking about why there hasn't been any follow-up?' and he said: 'Boy, you're right about that. Someone even told my wife about sealed indictments,' '' Mr. Rogers said. ''I came away from that meeting feeling stunned.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers said he thought Mr. Iglesias was shying away from the kinds of career-making cases prosecutors typically jump at, so he voiced doubts to Mr. Domenici.</p>
        <p>Mickey D. Barnett, another top Republican lawyer in the state, who once served as an aide to Mr. Domenici in Congress and represented the Bush campaign in New Mexico in the 2000 and 2004 elections, said he had also complained.</p>
        <p>''I would say to Pete and Heather: 'Look, you guys have some influence; I don't have any influence. Can we get something done?' '' Mr. Barnett said.</p>
        <p>He said Federal Bureau of Investigation agents had complained to him about Mr. Iglesias as well.</p>
        <p>Special Agent Bill Elwell, a spokesman for the bureau office in Albuquerque, acknowledged frustrations but said, ''We understand that public corruption cases take time, and it's important to get all your ducks in a row before you prosecute.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Iglesias, who is searching for a job in the private sector, defended his tenure. ''One of the things that the public may not understand is that these corruption cases take months of preparation,'' he said. ''We have only a small white-collar section in New Mexico.'' He said he could not discuss the courthouse case.</p>
        <p>He said he had not been aware of how angry some fellow Republicans were with him. ''I heard some general grumblings,'' he said. ''There was always a certain level of white noise, but I didn't pay much attention to it. I tried to stay out of circumstances where I might have felt direct political pressure.''</p>
