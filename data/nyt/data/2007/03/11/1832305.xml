        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Super-Sized Tuesday'' (editorial, March 8) seems to imply that it is more fair to the country to have a national candidate anointed by a few hundred thousand people in Iowa and New Hampshire than to allow the people in populous states like New York and California to have a real say in selecting the nominee. And for what reason? Because New Yorkers and Californians have the misfortune to live in an expensive media market?</p>

        <p>We have a national election. Why not have a national primary?</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Super-Sized Tuesday'' (editorial, March 8):</p>
        <p>The influence of Iowa and New Hampshire in determining a presidential nominee doesn't reflect a problem with our primary system; it reflects a problem with the electorate.</p>
        <p>With only a small fraction of delegates coming from these two states, it should be easy for voters elsewhere to have an impact on the election. Instead, they rubber-stamp the decisions made by the residents of Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>As long as primary voters gravitate toward the winners of earlier contests instead of taking the time to analyze the merits of the candidates for themselves, their laziness shouldn't be rewarded with an earlier primary date.</p>
