        <p>My husband and I are planning a trip to Croatia in the summer. We would like to spend some time in Rome on the way. Our miles are on American. Can you suggest the best way to travel from New York to Rome, from Rome to Split and from Split to New York? -- Sarah Gillespie, Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Multi-leg itineraries are generally best handled through a good travel agent. But as there are no direct flights between Split and New York, I suggest your most cost-effective option is to book separate round-trip tickets from New York to Rome, and from Rome to Split.</p>

        <p>A reader would like to find the best intra-European route for a summer trip with her husband.</p>

        <p>My husband and I are planning a trip to Croatia in the summer. We would like to spend some time in Rome on the way. Our miles are on American. Can you suggest the best way to travel from New York to Rome, from Rome to Split and from Split to New York? -- Sarah Gillespie, Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Multi-leg itineraries are generally best handled through a good travel agent. But as there are no direct flights between Split and New York, I suggest your most cost-effective option is to book separate round-trip tickets from New York to Rome, and from Rome to Split.</p>
        <p>How you travel to Rome depends on how important it is to use your American AAdvantage miles compared with getting the best fare and most convenient routing. Ask American whether award seats are available when you wish to travel (there are often blackout periods in summer months), then check fares. You may wish to use your miles in some other way.</p>
        <p>Go to American Airlines (www.aa.com) to check AAdvantage partner airlines. These include members of the OneWorld alliance, like British Airways (except for trans-Atlantic routes) and Iberia. American AAdvantage members must spend from 40,000 to 100,000 miles (depending on whether they are flying during peak or off-peak periods) to obtain a round-trip economy-class ticket between the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>In recent Web searches, American Airlines listed fares of $1,308 and $1,611 for round-trip direct flights from New York to Rome in June and July. On Orbitz.com, there were direct flights for $941 on Eurofly and $1,263 on Alitalia -- neither of which would earn you AAdvantage miles --and a one-stop, via Madrid, on Iberia for $988, on which you could earn or redeem miles. At the start of March, round trips from Rome to Split on Croatia Airlines in early July ranged from 212 to 570 euros ($340 to $752 at $1.35 to the euro) on www.opodo.it.</p>
        <p>Breaking your trip into two separate segments may seem unnecessarily complicated, but it should save you a significant amount. A quick check on www.kayak.com for the lowest fare in mid July on a New York-Rome-Split-New York ticket (with a four-day layover in Rome) turned up one for $2,551 on Lufthansa (not a OneWorld partner, by the way), and that flight required a layover in Frankfurt between Rome and Split, in both directions.</p>
