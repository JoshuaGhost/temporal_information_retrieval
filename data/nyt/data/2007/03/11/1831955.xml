        <p>It's a testament to the stylist Ray Petri's genius that more than 15 years after his death, his influence is everywhere. At the spring shows, his spirit turned up in collections as diverse as D&amp;G (tribal power), Alexander McQueen (Harlem dandies) and Junya Watanabe (sports gear as high fashion). Even his personal uniform of dark jeans, bomber jacket and porkpie hat has recently been sighted in Lower Manhattan, Omotesando and Hoxton Square.</p>

        <p>It's a testament to the stylist Ray Petri's genius that more than 15 years after his death, his influence is everywhere. At the spring shows, his spirit turned up in collections as diverse as D&amp;G (tribal power), Alexander McQueen (Harlem dandies) and Junya Watanabe (sports gear as high fashion). Even his personal uniform of dark jeans, bomber jacket and porkpie hat has recently been sighted in Lower Manhattan, Omotesando and Hoxton Square.</p>
        <p>''Ray Petri is an inspiration for most people in men's wear,'' says the designer Kim Jones, who, like Petri, makes a point of routinely exploring offbeat cultural signifiers. ''He worked with a loyal group of people to create a new aesthetic, and his references were so on target that they are still relevant today. This is extremely rare in fashion, where everything seems to move so quickly.''</p>
        <p>Ray Petrie (he later dropped the ''e'') was born in Scotland in 1948. When he was 15, he moved with his family to Brisbane, Australia, where he formed a band, the Chelsea Set, playing R&amp;B and Motown. But Australia felt provincial, and in 1969 he landed in London, where he experimented with ambisexual liaisons, swinging parties and the requisite interest in Eastern religion. During his spare time, he kept a jewelry booth at the Camden street market and took classes at Sotheby's to learn about antiques.</p>
        <p>By the early 1980s, the English scene had grown to resemble a supermarket of style -- punk, new wave, dandyism and sportswear converged on the street -- and Petri found his calling as a new kind of fashion arbiter. His passion was for overseeing everything about the creation of a photograph, except actually snapping the picture. Instead of using models and the buff blonds of the time, he cast teenagers, often of mixed descent, to wear designer clothes that he paired with underwear, vintage pieces and athletic basics best suited for bicycle messengers. The resulting look was unflinchingly tough and sexually charged.</p>
        <p>''Ray created an entire personal world,'' recalls the photographer Jean-Baptiste Mondino.</p>
        <p>''He was obsessed with 'bad boys,' Jamaican culture and Native American imagery, and was always surrounded by a crowd of beautiful people. It was a true collective -- in a way it reminded me of the Surrealist movement, but everyone was cool and relaxed. We would sit around listening to music, smoking a joint, and ideas would just come to us.''</p>
        <p>Mondino, who over the years collaborated with Petri on projects ranging from a David Bowie video to editorial spreads and commercials, sees him more as a designer than a stylist. ''He reshaped clothes to create silhouettes that simply didn't exist at the time,'' he says. ''He loved the idea of classic Italian tailoring done in a Caribbean way. From the front, the boys appeared effortlessly dressed, but in the back they were completely pinned, tucked and taped. Ray was obsessed with extra-long shirt sleeves, so he would cut them off at the shoulder and reattach them with big safety pins so that they stuck out under suit jackets.'' On occasion, he would even spray models with cologne during shoots.</p>
        <p>Some of Petri's more daring sartorial propositions, like boxer shorts and combat boots worn on their own under a trench coat, were clearly not the stuff of everyday life. Still -- or perhaps precisely because of that -- his vision had a profound effect on the culture at large. Pace-setting magazines like The Face, i-D and Arena embraced his work, and his circle of collaborators expanded considerably. Besides Mondino, regular members included the designer Jean Paul Gaultier; the himbo singer Nick Kamen, who got his break after Petri used him on the cover of The Face; the hip-hop star Neneh Cherry; and a sweet-tempered teenager named Naomi Campbell, who occasionally helped out at Petri's wardrobe sales, where he famously parted with Mugler jackets and other odds and ends for five pounds apiece.</p>
        <p>As fashion stylists started to become celebrities in their own right, Petri gathered his followers under the umbrella of Buffalo, his visual imaging company. He borrowed the name from Jacques Negrit, the bouncer at Les Bains Douches nightclub in Paris, whose private security business was staffed by large men from Guadeloupe who wore Air Force MA-1 jackets with ''Buffalo'' written on them. It was also an allusion to ''Buffalo Soldier,'' the Bob Marley song about black infantrymen who fought in the United States Army against Native Americans. Petri's posse wore cobalt-blue Buffalo jackets, and soon that word became shorthand for their universe. Neneh Cherry cemented the phenomenon with ''Buffalo Stance,'' her 1988 hit.</p>
        <p>''The song is about our gang, our time and our mentor, Ray, who is still behind every word and every melody,'' says Cherry, who met Petri en route to Tokyo, where he was producing a fashion show using eccentric London kids as models. ''Buffalo meant classic. None of us were into here-today-gone-tomorrow fashion, which is why we gravitated toward each other. Ray was always consistent, and he taught us that we shouldn't be afraid to be honest.''</p>
        <p>Just as Petri was poised to receive the mainstream recognition and financial success that many who followed in his footsteps enjoyed, he became sick with AIDS. ''He was one of the first well-known personalities in London to get the disease, and at the time not everyone knew how to react,'' says the milliner Stephen Jones. ''Sometimes people would move away from him at fashion shows, or they wouldn't invite him at all.'' A notable exception was Gaultier, who held a front-row seat for Petri until his death, in 1989. ''I was actually criticized for that by people working in the business, which made me very upset,'' Gaultier says. ''I felt that it was extremely courageous of Ray to expose himself. It was a show of strength, which I admired and had to support. But others refused to see the truth.''</p>
        <p>How would Petri feel about his posthumous vindication? ''I often think of what it would be like to have him around now,'' Mondino says. ''Ray died just as fashion was becoming more commercial, but I don't think that he would have approached things any differently than he always did. Most of his friends have made some money over the years, but to tell you the truth, we get a little bored a lot of the time.''</p>
