        <p>McCartney Mum After Divorce Hearing</p>
        <p>Paul McCartney, 64, left, whistled, snapped his fingers and flashed a peace sign but said nothing yesterday as he departed High Court in London after a closed preliminary hearing in his divorce case, The Associated Press reported. His estranged wife, Heather Mills McCartney, 38, right, left through a back door about 30 minutes later. The couple separated in May after four years of marriage and began divorce proceedings in July. They have a daughter, Beatrice, 3. British law forbids publication of allegations in divorce cases.</p>
        <p>Furor Over Painting's Move</p>
        <p>Italy may have insured ''The Annunciation,'' a Leonardo Da Vinci masterpiece, for $132 million, but opponents of its planned loan to Japan have appealed to the culture minister, Francesco Rutelli, to cancel the trip, Reuters reported. Some protesters have even threatened to chain themselves to the Uffizi Gallery in Florence to prevent the 15th-century painting, more than six feet long, from leaving on March 12. In Japan, the painting, depicting a seated Virgin Mary being approached by an angel, is to be displayed in a series of exhibitions celebrating Leonardo and other Italian artists. Cristina Acidini, an art historian and the superintendent of the Polo Museale Fiorentino, which oversees Florence's museums, said conservationists had examined the painting and given clearance for the transfer. ''From a conservation point of view there was no reason for us to deny the loan,'' she said. But some experts, including Antonio Natali, the Uffizi's director, say the painting is too delicate and precious for the long flight.</p>
        <p>Judge Warns Rapper</p>
        <p>The rapper Foxy Brown pleaded guilty yesterday in Manhattan Criminal Court to violating her probation by leaving New York without permission, The Associated Press reported. Judge Melissa C. Jackson said the rapper's sentence would continue her current six months' probation but warned against other probation violations, saying, ''I'm reserving the right to resentence you to jail for one year.'' Ms. Brown, 27, whose real name is Inga Marchand, was arrested on Feb. 15 in connection with a dispute at a beauty supply store in Pembroke Pines, Fla., where she was charged with simple battery and resisting an officer. She was sentenced to probation and anger management classes after a fight at a nail salon in Manhattan in 2004.</p>
        <p>Bobby Brown Out of Jail</p>
        <p>The R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown, 38, was released Wednesday after three nights in a Massachusetts jail when he paid $19,000 in child support and court fees, The Associated Press reported. A Boston native, Mr. Brown, left, has a history of failing to pay support on time, and a judge had ordered him held in the county jail in Dedham, after he was arrested while watching his daughter in a cheerleading competition at Attleboro High School. His lawyer, Phaedra Parks, said Mr. Brown has struggled to meet monthly payments to Kim Ward of Stoughton, Mass., the mother of two of his teenage children. Mr. Brown and Whitney Houston, who have a daughter, are divorcing after 14 years of marriage.</p>
        <p>Footnotes</p>
        <p>Mary Gordon, below, has won the $20,000 Story Prize for fiction for ''The Stories of Mary Gordon'' (Pantheon). Written over 30 years, the collection by Ms. Gordon, the Millicent C. McIntosh professor of English and chairwoman of the English department at Barnard College, includes 22 new and previously uncollected stories and 19 published in a 1987 volume, ''Temporary Shelter,'' Reuters reported.  For only the second time in the 29-year history of the Susan Smith Blackburn Awards, no first prize has been given. The $16,000 in top awards recognizing women for works of outstanding quality for the English-speaking theater were divided among Lucy Caldwell of Northern Ireland for ''Leaves,'' Sheila Callaghan of the United States for ''Dead City,'' Stella Feehily of Ireland for ''O Go My Man'' and Abbie Spallen of Ireland for ''Pumpgirl.''</p>
