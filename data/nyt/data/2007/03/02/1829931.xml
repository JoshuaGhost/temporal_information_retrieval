        <p>EVEN before the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was mortified by the uninhibited late-night rat fiesta caught on videotape at a Greenwich Village KFC/Taco Bell last week and broadcast worldwide, Elliott Marcus, the bearish guy who runs the department's rodent patrol, harbored a special feeling for rats.</p>
        <p>''Ugh, I hate rats,'' says Mr. Marcus, a delicate shiver reverberating beneath the black fleece pullover (incongruous over a red silk tie) serving as the sartorial equivalent of comfort food during this week of bureaucratic hand-wringing, finger-pointing and mea culpas. Though rats are the culprits in just 3 percent of vermin-related violations, and fly-borne contamination poses more dire health threats, rats still inspire hysteria. ''People are prejudiced against rats,'' he says.</p>

        <p>EVEN before the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was mortified by the uninhibited late-night rat fiesta caught on videotape at a Greenwich Village KFC/Taco Bell last week and broadcast worldwide, Elliott Marcus, the bearish guy who runs the department's rodent patrol, harbored a special feeling for rats.</p>
        <p>''Ugh, I hate rats,'' says Mr. Marcus, a delicate shiver reverberating beneath the black fleece pullover (incongruous over a red silk tie) serving as the sartorial equivalent of comfort food during this week of bureaucratic hand-wringing, finger-pointing and mea culpas. Though rats are the culprits in just 3 percent of vermin-related violations, and fly-borne contamination poses more dire health threats, rats still inspire hysteria. ''People are prejudiced against rats,'' he says.</p>
        <p>Be that as it may, the department that monitors the cutting-edge culinary technique sous vide (it means ''under vacuum'') in high-end establishments like Per Se, admits to lax inspection last week at the offending KFC/Taco Bell on Avenue of the Americas. The city's irked health commissioner, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, called it ''clearly not up to standard.''</p>
        <p>It turns out the franchise owner, ADF Companies, has committed violations at several of the 22 fast-food outlets it operates in the city, four of which were shut down by the department and 10 others voluntarily closed by Yum Brands Inc., which owns the KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut brands. (Eight of ADF's other restaurants passed inspection this week.) And yes, Mr. Marcus's team of more than 100 inspectors, who close an average of 500 restaurants each year for safety violations and is on track for 700 short-term shutdowns this fiscal year -- will get a refresher course in rodent detection.</p>
        <p>The inspector who responded to a 311 complaint of rodent activity at the KFC/Taco Bell on the Avenue of the Americas last Thursday but did not perform a full inspection -- it took the rat video to accomplish that, spurring a Friday morning visit by a different, less forgiving inspector -- was removed from the rotation.</p>
        <p>''It's difficult to talk about this without sounding defensive,'' says Mr. Marcus, whose inspectors are trained to ferret out vermin and other health hazards at the city's 30,000 restaurants in the course of 80,000 yearly inspections. ''And it always embarrasses me when we don't do our due diligence, but the bottom line is that this is not a health department problem, it's a management problem at those restaurants.</p>
        <p>''We've reviewed this inspector's record; she's certainly not terrible and not among the most lenient. Obviously, we should have shut that place down Thursday, not Friday. But we can't close every place where we cite a violation: there would be no restaurants left in New York.'' Though they close plenty, and not just dives: TriBeCa's Centrico and tourist havens like Stage Deli and Carnegie Deli have done time on the closure list.</p>
        <p>MR. Marcus, a robust 55, attributes his own girth to an insatiable appetite, something that rats know all about. But he gets his exercise by swimming at the gym or using the Nordic trekking equipment in his Bronx apartment rather than hurdling the furniture in less-than-sanitary restaurants. And nobody films him in the act.</p>
        <p>Despite having climbed his way up the city government's bureaucracy -- he managed the health department's employee-assistance program and directed its poisoning-prevention effort before becoming a commissioner for food safety and community sanitation in 2001 -- Mr. Marcus is an upfront speaker. So it takes no prodding for him to explain why he dislikes rats on principle -- and has done so since he was 15 and saw his first one while clearing weeds in a vacant lot in the Rockaways.</p>
        <p>''They scare the heck out of me,'' he says, hunched at the conference table in his panoramic corner office -- he admits he lucked out with water and Empire State Building views -- at 2 Lafayette Street. ''Actually, when it comes to food safety, rats are not our biggest concern, but they do cause a more violent reaction: nobody wants to eat in a place with rodents running around.''</p>
        <p>While the rats were pursuing video stardom, Mr. Marcus, a father of four daughters and grandfather of six, was vacationing in Jamaica with his wife, Jackie, a fifth-grade teacher. He returned on Sunday and instantly got down to the dual business of external damage control and internal knuckle-rapping. The errant inspector's supervisor was chided for not requesting a full inspection after signs of rat activity were confirmed. Which didn't require a magnifying glass.</p>
        <p>Rats, Mr. Marcus notes, are notorious for not cleaning up after themselves: ''They're terrible that way, just like men.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marcus was raised in a family brimming with ''do-gooders.'' His grandmother was a labor organizer, his father a fur industry organizer who served as Paul Robeson's bodyguard at the 1949 Peekskill concert/race riot and his mother a teacher and assistant principal in the city system. He received a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Social Work and wound up in city government because he wanted to work in the field of environmental health policy.</p>
        <p>During a community board meeting held before the city adopted its smoking ban, he was denounced as ''the smoking Nazi.'' That didn't faze him. He points to a framed quotation -- on a menu cover -- from former Czech president (and playwright) Vaclav Havel: ''Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense no matter how it turns out.''</p>
        <p>In this case, he says, ''The rats will not win.''</p>
