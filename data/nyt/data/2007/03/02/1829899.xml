        <p>An unemployed barber who went on a shooting rampage in an East Village wine bar more than four years ago, screaming, ''White people are going to burn tonight,'' was convicted yesterday of attempted murder as a hate crime.</p>
        <p>The barber, Steven Johnson, 39, shot and wounded three people and sprayed several patrons with kerosene, threatening to set them on fire, at Bar Veloce on Second Avenue in June 2002.</p>
        <p>He was disarmed after two women in the bar tackled him.</p>
        <p>The women, Anne Hubbard, who was 34 at the time, and Ann-Margret Gidley, who was 23, were waitresses at the Gotham Bar and Grill. They had gathered at Bar Veloce with other Gotham employees for a farewell party for a waiter moving to Dallas, when Mr. Johnson burst in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson shot Ms. Hubbard in the shin as she tackled him. Shoji Iso, the owner of a sushi restaurant three doors down, heard the commotion and was shot in the wrist when he peeked in the door of Bar Veloce to see what was going on.</p>
        <p>The jury of six women and six men in State Supreme Court in Manhattan convicted Mr. Johnson yesterday after four and a half days of deliberation. They rejected the contention of Mr. Johnson's defense lawyer, Michelle Gelernt, that he was suffering from delusions and therefore not legally responsible for what he did.</p>
        <p>It was the second trial for Mr. Johnson; a jury deadlocked in his first trial in November 2004.</p>
        <p>One of the jurors, Harry Donas, 45, an engineer, said after yesterday's verdict that the jury thought there were other reasons besides delusions to explain Mr. Johnson's behavior. Among them, Mr. Donas said, were that his female companion had died of AIDS, that he planned it two months earlier, and that he was losing his business.</p>
        <p>Attempted murder normally brings a sentence of up to 25 years in prison. But prosecutors said yesterday that Mr. Johnson faced a potentially longer sentence, depending on his prior record, because attempted murder as a hate crime is considered a more serious offense than attempted murder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson has a criminal record for weapons and drug arrests going back to 1985. He showed no reaction to the verdict yesterday. Sentencing was scheduled for later this month.</p>
        <p>On the night of the shooting, Mr. Johnson -- armed with a samurai sword, three pistols, kerosene and plastic handcuffs -- took the train from his Williamsburg, Brooklyn, housing project into Manhattan, later telling the police that he went to the East Village in search of people partying, and that he wanted to kill as many white people as he could.</p>
        <p>The rampage began around 2 a.m., when he demanded a man's wallet and then shot him in the torso.</p>
        <p>Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said after the shooting that the attack was so bizarre that it could only have been the product of someone who was ''clearly deranged.''</p>
