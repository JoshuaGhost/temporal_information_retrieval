        <p>Andrea Rosen Gallery  525 West 24th Street, Chelsea  Through March 10</p>
        <p>Gillian Carnegie's second solo show of paintings in New York is better than her first, but too self-conscious -- occasionally brittle of surface and obscure in thought. At the gallery's entrance, a blow-up of an old postcard of a painting depicting a circus or carnival coming to town suggests that the whole show is a kind of joke, or at least meant to be taken as an installation.</p>
        <p>To the left, the first painting is small and depicts a leafless tree painted in yellow on gray on a small canvas that might be an early Mondrian. The same tree recurs, wrought large in another painting and in the background behind a thickly painted gray gate in a third. The russet checkerboard of tiles in front of the gate is transferred to a drawn curtain in ''Maison Merlin,'' the show's final painting.</p>
        <p>Other paintings reveal that Ms. Carnegie has semiabstract landscape subjects, weirdly parsed flower still lifes and hard-to-read monochrome images under consideration. Furthermore, it appears that each of her exhibitions still requires a saucy rendering of her bare bottom to remind us that she is not as old-fashioned as she often appears to be.</p>
        <p>But some of these works are painted with real command, a capacity that can apparently be varied at will. Ms. Carnegie can either choose between the Conceptual and the painterly or keep trying for a more organic merger of the not-so-distant twain. But she seems to be moving in the right direction.</p>
