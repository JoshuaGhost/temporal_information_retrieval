        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Historians Fight Bush on Access to Papers'' (Arts pages, March 8):</p>
        <p>President Bush should rescind his 2001 executive order to restrict access to presidential records.</p>
        <p>A president of the United States is a historical personage elected by and accountable to the American public. He sacrifices his right to privacy, or ought to, in the public's interest.</p>
        <p>By restricting or denying access to historical documents, Mr. Bush in effect says that he and other presidents should not be held accountable for their actions, and, worse, that we should not learn from the intimate details of their successes and mistakes.</p>
        <p>Those who do not learn from the past are doomed to repeat it. But how can such learning occur when access to the very documents that reveal that past is obstructed?</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush casts this issue as a matter of personal privacy; it is not. This has been a consistent problem with Mr. Bush's presidency. He seems to think it is all about him. It should be all about us.</p>
        <p>Neil Chesanow  Montvale, N.J., March 8, 2007</p>
