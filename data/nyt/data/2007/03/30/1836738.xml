        <p>Ollie's, one of Manhattan's best-known Chinese restaurant chains, was sued yesterday by 43 waiters, deliverymen and other workers who accused it of violating minimum wage laws by paying some employees as little as $1.40 an hour.</p>

        <p>Ollie's, one of Manhattan's best-known Chinese restaurant chains, was sued yesterday by 43 waiters, deliverymen and other workers who accused it of violating minimum wage laws by paying some employees as little as $1.40 an hour.</p>
        <p>At a news conference and protest rally outside the Ollie's Noodle Shop and Grille at 68th Street and Broadway, several dozen workers carried signs saying, ''Slave Labor'' and ''Ollie's Pay Back Our Sweat-Earned Money.''</p>
        <p>Several Ollie's workers complained that they had worked 65 to 70 hours a week, but received just $400 a month in wages, amounting to less than $1.60 an hour before tips. Under New York State law, restaurants must pay tipped workers at least $4.60 an hour -- less than the $7.15 minimum for nontipped workers.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan and involves workers at three Ollie's locations: those on West 44th Street; 68th Street and Broadway; and 84th Street and Broadway, but not the ones at 116th Street and Broadway and at 42nd Street and Ninth Avenue.</p>
        <p>''They've been taking advantage of us,'' said April Dong, a 27-year-old immigrant from China who is a waitress at the 44th Street Ollie's. ''They've stolen the money we earned through our sweat.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dong said she had long worked about 65 hours a week, usually from 11 a.m. to 9:30 or 10 p.m., six days a week and received $400 a month in wages and $1,000 to $1,500 a month in tips. She and several other workers said their paycheck stubs inaccurately showed that they had worked a total of 40 hours every two weeks, far less than the 130 hours or more that they said they worked.</p>
        <p>A receptionist at the office of Ollie's president, Tsu Yue Wang, said he was not available. Mr. Wang's lawyer declined to comment. But restaurant managers for Ollie's denied any violations.</p>
        <p>Benny Li, manager of the Ollie's at 68th Street and Broadway, said his restaurant pays its waiters and deliverymen $4.60 an hour and schedules them just eight hours a day.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dong and several other workers said Ollie's recently reduced their hours to eight a day after they began complaining. Several workers said that they had complained to the state's Labor Department.</p>
        <p>Tommy Chu, manager of the Ollie's on 44th Street, denied that his employees used to work 11-hour days. He said they essentially worked during two peak periods, noon to 2, and 5:30 to 8 p.m., and in between many left the restaurant.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit and protest are part of a widening campaign, called Justice Will Be Served, in which advocacy groups are pressuring Asian restaurants throughout Manhattan to comply with federal and state wage laws.</p>
        <p>Gui Ming Li, 33, a deliveryman for the 84th Street Ollie's, said that his pay of $700 a month before tips barely covered the costs of operating the motorcycle he used for deliveries.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit filed yesterday also accuses Ollie's management of overtime violations and improperly taking employees' tips.</p>
