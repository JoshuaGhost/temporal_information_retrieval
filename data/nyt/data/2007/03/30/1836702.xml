        <p>Last wishes notwithstanding, federal officials are opposed to a Montana woman's plan for a business that would spread the cremated remains of her clients over western Montana's publicly owned wild mountain peaks and flower-studded meadows.</p>
        <p>To Fran Coover, her new business, Ladies in White, seemed a perfect way to blend her interest in the environment and alternatives to the American way of dying. ''It's much less expensive,'' Ms. Coover said. ''And it is far more environmentally benign.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Last wishes notwithstanding, federal officials are opposed to a Montana woman's plan for a business that would spread the cremated remains of her clients over western Montana's publicly owned wild mountain peaks and flower-studded meadows.</p>
        <p>To Fran Coover, her new business, Ladies in White, seemed a perfect way to blend her interest in the environment and alternatives to the American way of dying. ''It's much less expensive,'' Ms. Coover said. ''And it is far more environmentally benign.''</p>
        <p>For $390 Ms. Coover, a former administrator at a project studying end-of-life care here, along with two other ladies, offered to scatter the ashes of clients and provide a ceremony, a photograph, journal notes and Global Positioning System coordinates of the final resting place. Ten percent of the cost would be donated to groups who work to protect wild lands.</p>
        <p>But after Ms. Coover scattered the cremated remains of her first client, she applied to the federal Forest Service, one of Montana's largest owners of wild land, for a special-use permit to continue her business.</p>
        <p>Though some officials told her it was fine to scatter the ashes on public land, she says, officials from Region I of the Forest Service, which covers Montana and Idaho, said it was against national policy and denied a permit.</p>
        <p>She took her request to the Bureau of Land Management, the largest of the country's federal land management agencies. At first the bureau seemed fine with it, she says, until it sent out an e-mail message to stakeholders, or groups with an interest in public lands, and ran into opposition from Indian tribes.</p>
        <p>Exasperated at the barriers, Ms. Coover said, she is preparing appeals. ''Three women in white dresses and hiking boots want to carry a pack on their back into a wilderness area,'' she said. ''How harmful can that be? Does it make sense for people to have land they love logged or torn up by mines, but not available to have ashes scattered?''</p>
        <p>But the Forest Service has long had a firm policy against commercial scattering, said Gordon Schofield, the group leader for land use here in Region I. If ashes are scattered ''the land takes on a sacredness, and people want to put up a marker or a plaque,'' Mr. Schofield said, then they oppose activities they do not see as compatible with the site as a resting place.</p>
        <p>The Forest Service has a version of a ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy for private individuals who want to scatter the ashes of a loved one.</p>
        <p>''We don't prohibit it, but we don't authorize it,'' Mr. Schofield said. ''People should do what they think is right.'' But an allowed commercial enterprises require a permit, he said.</p>
        <p>Wilderness Watch, a conservation group, opposes dissemination of human remains in wilderness areas.</p>
        <p>''I understand wilderness is sacred ground and many people feel closer to the Creator there than they do in church,'' said George Nickas, the group's executive director. ''But it's also a place where commercial enterprise is not allowed. I think the prohibition on Ladies in White is the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nickas said he would allow the women to scatter ashes on public land that is not wilderness because ''we allow all kinds of commercial activity'' on such land.</p>
        <p>As people turn to nontraditional ways of disposing of their loved ones' remains, ash-scattering businesses have blossomed. Families can choose to have ashes scattered in a variety of ways, including from a helium balloon or an airplane flying over an ocean or a volcano.</p>
        <p>In Britain, a company called Heavens Above Fireworks, sends remains into the sky in ''a spectacular fireworks display.''</p>
        <p>While she appeals the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management decisions, Ms. Coover said, she is negotiating with a private landowner, a rancher, to scatter ashes on his mountain property.</p>
        <p>''Cremation is growing by the year,'' she said, ''and people are looking for a place to scatter. The public land is public legacy, and it's where ashes belong.''</p>
