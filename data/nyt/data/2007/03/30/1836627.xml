        <p>7 P.M. (Cartoon Network) BILLY &amp; MANDY'S BIG BOOGEY ADVENTURE (2007) -- Poor Grim Reaper. The Underworld has stripped him of his powers and his ability to frighten in the first movie-length version of this popular cartoon. So, with the help of Billy, Mandy and Irwin, Grim must beat his arch rival, the Boogey Man, to the one thing that can make him the scariest being alive: the Hand of Horror! Repeats at 8:45 p.m.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CBS) GHOST WHISPERER -- Ghost whisperer meets dog whisperer when Melinda (Jennifer Love Hewitt) has to help a four-legged spirit, Homer the Ghost Dog, cross to the other side. The dog whisperer, Cesar Millan, appears as himself.</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (CMT) THE ULTIMATE COYOTE UGLY SEARCH -- A bartender mixes a drink and moves on to the next one. The women of Coyote Ugly mix drinks and move on to bar-top dancing, foot stomping and clothes-skimping. Tonight Liliana Lovell, the founder of the East Village honky-tonk that became a national chain, chooses nine Coyote veterans from around the country to vie for five spots in the competition to be the Ultimate Coyote (and take home $50,000).</p>
        <p>8 P.M. (Travel Channel) MIRACLE QUEST -- Reported miracles draw more visitors than any pre-fab tourist attraction. Flavia Colgan travels the globe to visit sites where miracles have been documented, beginning with southern Italy, a countryside steeped in Catholic tradition. She follows in the footsteps of one of the most famous stigmatics, Padre Pio, and visits the sites of two reported Eucharistic miracles.</p>
        <p>8:30 P.M. (Animal Planet) SAVING GRACE THE OTTER -- One family's commitment to saving an abandoned otter is given a final test as it sees if Grace can survive on her own in the wild.</p>
        <p>11:35 P.M. -- If you are curious about the Will Ferrell male-figure-skating comedy ''Blades of Glory,'' which comes out today, look no further: three late-night shows are playing host to three of its actors. Jon Heder, the comedian formerly known for his turn in ''Napoleon Dynamite,'' appears on CBS's ''Late Show With David Letterman.'' NBC's ''Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' features the actress and ''Saturday Night Live'' cast member Amy Poehler, who plays Mr. Heder's rival in the film. At 12:06 a.m. Will Arnett, Ms. Poehler's skating partner in the movie and husband in real life, takes the hot seat to give his version of events on ABC's ''Jimmy Kimmel Live.''</p>
