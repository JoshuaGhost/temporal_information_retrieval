        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Singular Pain: When Death Cuts the Bond of Twins'' (Thursday Styles, March 1):</p>
        <p>I can't imagine how a twin survives the death of another. My brother died an untimely death at age 32 -- 17 months ago -- and yet my first thought every day is ''he's still dead.''</p>
        <p>He was 10 years younger than I, and was the fourth of six children. When he died, I didn't feel as if anyone who hadn't lost a sibling could understand the particular grief I felt. Among the useless consolations offered were ''but you come from a big family, right?'' or ''you have another brother, don't you?''</p>
        <p>I didn't want sympathy, I needed empathy. I found it with my other siblings. They are far from interchangeable, but they have all suffered the same loss. We saved one another. But I can't conceive of the lonely desolation of losing a sibling, much less a twin, and being left a singleton.</p>
        <p>While there are writings about surviving the death of a parent, spouse and, most awfully, a child, I have found that the ragged and wrong feeling of a sibling's death is relatively unexplored.</p>
