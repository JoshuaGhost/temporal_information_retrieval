        <p>It's a big day for fans of the Internet site cheddarvision.tv, where visitors have been watching a 44-pound round of cheddar mature 24 hours a day since Jan. 1. Today something will actually happen. As of last night, the site had counted more than 500,000 hits. About 55,000 fans are expected today, the BBC reported, when the camera, set up in a farmhouse by the West Country Farmhouse Cheesemakers, Somerset farmers who produces handmade cheddar, is given its first quality check. To ensure that the cheese is maturing properly (it is fully expected to take a year), an expert cheese maker will pull out a core and sniff and taste it, the BBC said. The sampling is at 10 a.m. local time, or 5 a.m. New York time.</p>
