        <p>IN Philip Taaffe's book nothing is ever used up. Any motif, whether man-made or taken directly from nature, can have a new and vital life, with proper placement and adjustments in scale and color, of course. Ditto any technique. This point is driven home by the suavely eye-popping new paintings in Mr. Taaffe's latest show at the uptown Gagosian Gallery. They partake of everything from Northwest Coast Indian masks to Islamic ornamental patterns to marbleizing and gilding, and the word recycling doesn't begin to do them justice.</p>
        <p>These works serve notice that Mr. Taaffe is one of the best painters of his generation, one who has extended both 1970s Pattern and Decoration and the '80s practices of appropriation and juxtaposition into new areas. He has been aided by important cues from his elders -- Warhol's washy colors and ghostly, touch-free surfaces, and Jackson Pollock's all-over dripped unities. He has warmed up and slowed down these twin peaks of technique with his own brand of weirdly nonchalant labor-intensiveness. Once you absorb the dazzle and cultural references of Mr. Taaffe's surfaces, you may spend time simply trying to fathom how they are made.</p>

        <p>These works serve notice that Mr. Taaffe is one of the best painters of his generation, one who has extended both 1970s Pattern and Decoration and the '80s practices of appropriation and juxtaposition into new areas. He has been aided by important cues from his elders -- Warhol's washy colors and ghostly, touch-free surfaces, and Jackson Pollock's all-over dripped unities. He has warmed up and slowed down these twin peaks of technique with his own brand of weirdly nonchalant labor-intensiveness. Once you absorb the dazzle and cultural references of Mr. Taaffe's surfaces, you may spend time simply trying to fathom how they are made.</p>
        <p>True to his 1980s origins, Mr. Taaffe's paintings always involve collage: selected motifs are silk-screened onto nearly transparent paper, cut out and glued like decals onto fields of color or over other printed or stenciled motifs. This piecemeal technique is perfectly suited to his polymorphous, pantheistic sensibility, with its unwavering faith in the spiritual and decorative potential of anything that catches his eye.</p>
        <p>''Cape Sinope,'' ''Cape Vitus'' and ''Cape Zephyr'' combine grainy images of anamorphic stone faces from several cultures: charcoal-toned images from old archaeology books that modern photography has rendered utterly tossable. But here they are again, rendered large, in like company, glued to grounds dappled with fuzzy abstract shapes that suggest giant potato prints and reanimated by eyes, beaks and other motifs excerpted from Northwest Coast Indian carvings -- additions that startle further by introducing a bright white to the surface. The gods terrify anew. But not so fast: several bug-eyed concentric circles bring to mind Duchamp's rotary discs. Attention paid to the different uses of a carved owl face in these three works is rewarded.</p>
        <p>In ''Locus Auratus'' and ''Port of Saints,'' Mr. Taaffe revisits motifs he has used before, specifically the undulating waves from Bridget Riley's Op Art paintings, deployed here in gold across fields of Islamic fretwork patterns, with results that suggest opulent flags or Tiffany's favrile glass. A whole other kind of rhythm is evident in ''Asuka Passage,'' where enlargements of the bronze haloes on early Japanese buddhas combine with generic Persian crescents to create the illusion of rippling flames.</p>
        <p>Other paintings indicate some new directions more bluntly, like the use of brilliantly colored drips and pours in ''Plinth'' and ''Caravanserai'' that rethink Pollock by way of marbleized endpapers, and, in ''Magic Lantern With Rugosa,'' a ground made with positive and negative cardboard relief plates cut with the shapes of various Renaissance lance blades.</p>
        <p>''Dryadic Figures'' makes full-bodied the figurative impulse of the ''Cape'' paintings with images that resemble rough-cut totemic rocks and introduce Mr. Taaffe's first emphatic horizon line. The rocks are actually close-ups of the bark of first-growth Douglas firs in the Pacific Northwest from another old book; the decorative circles that punctuated them are enlargements of ancient bobbins and 19th-century German cabinetry decoration. And so the chain of visual being that Mr. Taaffe is defining, link by link, goes on.</p>
        <p>The show continues through March 31 at Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 78th Street; (212) 744-2313.</p>
