        <p>A sports article on Wednesday about Princeton's struggling men's basketball team misattributed a quotation by a player who supports Coach Joe Scott. It was Justin Conway -- not his teammate Luke Owings -- who said during a postgame news conference on Tuesday: ''I respect Coach Scott a lot. He is the most passionate guy I have ever met, and his passion is directed toward making Princeton basketball as great as it possibly can be. I want to be with a guy who is doing everything he can and is pouring everything into what his goal is. Coach Scott definitely does that.'' Although both players spoke during the news conference, Owings made no comments about the coaching.</p>
        <p>The article also referred incorrectly to a former player, Scott Greenman, who was the team's leading scorer as a senior in the 2005-6 season. He missed 4 of the team's 27 games with a back injury, according to N.C.A.A. statistics -- not ''much'' of that season. Because of an editing error, the article also referred incorrectly in some copies to the time of Greenman's injury. It was last season, not this season. (He graduated last year.)</p>
