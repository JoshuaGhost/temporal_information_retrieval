        <p>''My brother paid $1 to see your underwear.''</p>
        <p>''Gary, by the way, why are we wearing bras on our heads?''</p>
        <p>''Mess with the bull, you'll get the horns.''</p>
        <p>Relive these and other culturally ascendant milestones in ''Don't You Forget About Me: Contemporary Writers on the Films of John Hughes,'' an anthology with a forward by Ally Sheedy. Tonight contributors discuss whether they were jocks, preps, prisses, nerds or outcasts, and how few high school parties actually ended up with a girl stripped to her undies in the center of the dance floor. If you can handle the nostalgia, come early for a screening of ''Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' and pretend you weren't old enough to see it in the theaters the first time around. Anyone? Anyone?</p>
        <p>7:30 p.m. screening; discussion to follow, IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at West Third Street, (212) 924-7771.</p>
