        <p>Basic Books plans to introduce a new series of slim biographies of subjects encompassing Andy Warhol's soup cans, the Alfred Hitchcock classic ''Psycho,'' and Wagner's ''Ring'' cycle. Basic Books, an imprint of the Perseus Books Group, plans to announce today that the new series, ''Basic Ideas,'' is to begin this fall. David Steinberger, the president and chief executive of Perseus, said he has signed 10 authors so far, including William F. Buckley Jr. (to write about Barry Goldwater's ''Conscience of a Conservative''), Stephanie Coontz (Betty Friedan's ''Feminine Mystique'') and Jeff Sharlet (Pete Seeger's ''If I Had a Hammer''). Mr. Steinberger said the series would include brief, powerful books by writers with extraordinary insight about significant works.</p>
