        <p>The men and women who populate contemporary relationship dramas tend to belong to a specific demographic, and when they quarrel, do so on pale sofas and sea grass rugs. Their minds may be cluttered -- with unruly dissatisfaction, with upper-middle-class regret -- but their rooms have the air of 100 oxygen tanks.</p>
        <p>The set of ''Chicken,'' a new play by Mike Batistick at Michael Imperioli's Studio Dante, inflicts a certain stifling anxiety right away.

        <p>The men and women who populate contemporary relationship dramas tend to belong to a specific demographic, and when they quarrel, do so on pale sofas and sea grass rugs. Their minds may be cluttered -- with unruly dissatisfaction, with upper-middle-class regret -- but their rooms have the air of 100 oxygen tanks.</p>
        <p>The set of ''Chicken,'' a new play by Mike Batistick at Michael Imperioli's Studio Dante, inflicts a certain stifling anxiety right away. Designed in exquisite detail by Mr. Imperioli's wife, Victoria Imperioli, the set is a tiny, cramped apartment full of the mess of people who must worry about money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Batistick renders his metaphors in the thickest available chalk, but the story itself is as moving as the jump over the class divide is rare. ''Chicken'' is about marriage and imperiled masculinity. In it a cuckold of a husband, Wendell (E. J. Carroll), who works for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and grew up in foster care, takes an avid interest in cockfighting in the hope that it will bring in much-needed extra income to help support his growing family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Imperioli plays the best friend he enlists to help him win the fight, and while his talents are undeniable, it is Mr. Carroll who dominates, who is such a believable presence onstage that it is hard to shift your attentions away from him. But Sharon Angela, who plays his wife, Lena, more than rises to the challenge of balancing her character's brittle demeanor and soft, ruined spirit.</p>
        <p>Ms. Angela's training on ''The Sopranos,'' in which she plays the widow Rosalie Aprile, has clearly given her a knack for deadpan humor, and here she elevates lines that might easily come off as clich√© with the dexterity of her comic rhythm. When asked why she is smoking while pregnant, she responds not with defensiveness but with mellow resignation: ''People in Ireland do it all the time.''</p>
        <p>In this play her cast mate from ''The Sopranos,'' Mr. Imperioli, again succeeds in bringing us the thug loser, and you cannot watch without wondering when he will do something radically different. (''Law &amp; Order'' doesn't count.) What a pleasure it would be to see him as a temperate financial planner, or maybe a chemist.</p>
        <p>''Chicken'' runs through March 31 at Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444.</p>
