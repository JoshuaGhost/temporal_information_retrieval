        <p>Two Border Patrol agents examining packages of marijuana that had floated ashore along the Rio Grande were fired upon by unseen assailants on the Mexican side of the river, the authorities said. The agents, who returned fire, were not injured, and there was no sign that their bullets had struck anyone, said Oscar Saldana, a Border Patrol spokesman. It was the second such episode this year along a narrow part of the Rio Grande near Donna, about 13 miles northeast of McAllen. Mr. Saldana said the shooting was most likely a response by drug smugglers to the Border Patrol's more intensive searches of the area.</p>
