        <p>British authorities proposed new rules on Tuesday to allow schools to forbid Muslim students to wear full-face veils in class, reflecting a wider debate over Britain's relationship with its Muslim minority.</p>
        <p>The recommendation was the latest episode in a saga of rancorous discussion of the full-face veil, known as the niqab. Last October, Prime Minister Tony Blair described the niqab as a ''mark of separation'' that made ''other people from outside the community feel uncomfortable.''</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>British authorities proposed new rules on Tuesday to allow schools to forbid Muslim students to wear full-face veils in class, reflecting a wider debate over Britain's relationship with its Muslim minority.</p>
        <p>The recommendation was the latest episode in a saga of rancorous discussion of the full-face veil, known as the niqab. Last October, Prime Minister Tony Blair described the niqab as a ''mark of separation'' that made ''other people from outside the community feel uncomfortable.''</p>
        <p>The Department of Education published the new guidelines after a court in Buckinghamshire rejected a 12-year-old Muslim girl's demand to wear the niqab in class last month.</p>
        <p>The proposed regulations, which have yet to be formally adopted, said the individual right to ''manifest a religion or belief'' did not bestow a right to demonstrate faith ''at any time, in any place or in any particular manner.''</p>
        <p>School principals should be allowed to order pupils to show their faces because otherwise ''the teacher may not be able to judge their engagement in class,'' the proposed regulations said. Moreover, they said, ''schools need to be able to identify individual pupils in order to maintain good order and identify intruders easily.''</p>
        <p>The issue of Islamic dress in schools has been contentious in many parts of Europe, sometimes pitting secularist ideologies against the religious beliefs of growing Islamic minorities.</p>
        <p>But Islamic dress made headlines in Britain for another reason recently, when a trial of terrorism suspects included surveillance television footage of a male suspect at a bus station as he fled London in what appeared to be an all-covering burqa-style dress.</p>
        <p>Jim Knight, the schools minister, said Tuesday that schools should consult with parents when setting their regulations on permissible uniforms. ''While they should make every effort to accommodate social, religious or medical requirements of individual pupils, the needs of safety, security and effective learning in the school must always take precedence,'' he said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The government's position drew angry responses from some Muslim groups, including the Islamic Human Rights Commission, whose chairman, Massoud Shadjareh, said it was ''simply shocking'' for the government to ''issue guidance against Muslim communities.''</p>
        <p>''Successive ministers dealing with education issues have failed to give proper guidance when requested by human rights campaigners about schools' obligations regarding religious dress, including the head scarf,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Others sought to defuse the debate by insisting that disagreements over dress codes could be resolved within schools. ''The vast majority of schools are able to solve these issues locally, and that should continue to be the case,'' said Tahir Alam, a spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain.</p>
        <p>The proposed dress regulations also included recommendations enjoining school principals not to discriminate indirectly against minorities by banning hair styles ''more likely to be adopted by specific racial groups.''</p>
        <p>The rules urged school authorities to outlaw forms of dress ''associated with gangs,'' but said students should not be expelled for refusing to wear standard school uniforms except in the event of ''persistent and defiant'' transgressions.</p>
