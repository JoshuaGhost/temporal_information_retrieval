        <p>In the first session of the new military commission system set up by Congress, the first detainee to face a judge sounded for a time as though he was ready for a trial.</p>
        <p>It was David Hicks, an Australian Qaeda trainee who has become by fluke and design one of the best known of the 385 detainees here. Some 75 detainees face similar war crimes prosecutions.</p>
        <p>On Monday afternoon, Mr. Hicks told the judge that he wanted more lawyers ''to give me a better chance in my defense.''</p>
        <p>Between then and a reconvened session after 8 p.m., things changed. He pleaded guilty to providing material support to a terrorist organization. It was the military equivalent of a plea bargain, the rubber-meets-the-road moment that makes it possible for courts all over America to cope with caseloads that would choke them if every defendant insisted on a trial.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday an Australian official said that as part of the deal Mr. Hicks would serve ''a bit'' more time in prison beyond the five years he has been here, but that he would be allowed to serve it in Australia.</p>
        <p>What happened in between the afternoon and evening sessions on Monday, explanations and observations of people at the court here make clear, is just what happens in those tens of thousands of more prosaic cases every day -- an emotion-laden measure by both sides of the costs and benefits of pressing ahead.</p>
        <p>''It's a way to get home, and he's told us he just wants to get home,'' Mr. Hicks's father, Terry Hicks, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday. The father flew out of Guantánamo on Monday between court sessions, after a rare visit with his son.</p>
        <p>Though the rules in the military commissions are singular, Mr. Hicks's case showed that the pressures and calculations were much like those that weigh on people in civilian courts.</p>
        <p>The commissions, the first war crimes trials conducted by the United States since World War II, are heavy with diplomatic, military and legal implications. Still, Mr. Hicks's sudden arrangement with his prosecutors is not likely to be the last deal as the Guantánamo cases stack up and international pressures increase to give the detainees their day in court.</p>
        <p>The events here were not unlike those in the garden-variety case. It was no secret here over the weekend that plea discussions had long been under way. The sole issue seemed to be whether the deal would be done now or down the road.</p>
        <p>Before the hearing on Monday, the chief prosecutor, Col. Morris D. Davis of the Air Force, provided a rough calculation of the terms. Though Mr. Hicks faced a possible life sentence, Colonel Davis said that was not in the cards.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe this is a life-sentence case,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He mentioned the 20-year sentence that an American court gave John Walker Lindh, the American Muslim who was a Taliban soldier, a young man whose history was not unlike that of Mr. Hicks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hicks, now a plump 31-year-old, has been described as another Westerner in search of meaning in his days in Afghanistan in 2001. The prosecutors say Mr. Hicks once complained to Osama bin Laden about the lack of Qaeda training materials in English.</p>
        <p>After the guilty plea, Colonel Davis said Mr. Hicks might be on Australian soil by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The defense, too, had made it plain that anything could occur in court. Before the session on Monday, David H. B. McLeod, an Australian lawyer working with the defense, said he was not sure whether Mr. Hicks would end up pleading guilty, not guilty or entering no plea when he was called on at the planned arraignment by the judge, Col. Ralph H. Kohlmann of the Marines.</p>
        <p>The answer turned out to be no plea from Mr. Hicks. The session in a heavily secured squat building facing sparkling Guantánamo Bay ended after 5 p.m. By 7 p.m., word circulated that the court would soon be back in session.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hicks's decision came quickly after years of delays, setbacks and waiting. The afternoon session was bitter, with disputes between defense lawyers and the military judge over the rules of the tribunals, offering indications that lengthy legal battles were in the offing in the bumpy process.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Hicks's case, all that was required on Monday night was a single word: guilty.</p>
        <p>It took just a minute for Mr. Hicks's military defense lawyer, Maj. Michael D. Mori of the Marines, to say that word. Mr. Hicks's decision came five years after the United States had initially expected to try detainees.</p>
        <p>From the plea, the process is widely expected to take a few days. The lawyers need to cobble together the specific acts that Mr. Hicks will admit to.</p>
        <p>Did he, as the charges state, join with a group of Qaeda fighters near Kandahar Airport in the Afghan conflict? Was he armed with an AK-47 when going by the name Abu Muslim Australia?</p>
        <p>When that is worked out, the judge will summon the panel of commission members, at least five military officers, who will formally decide the sentence. The members, whose names have not been released, are expected here by the end of the week.</p>
