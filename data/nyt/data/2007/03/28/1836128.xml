His commitment to providing our community with the highest level of health care services by furthering the mission of the Medical Center will be forever remembered at Sound Shore. We will miss his guidance and support. Our deepest sympathies are extended to his wife Mayde and their children and grandchildren. Mauro C. Romita, Chairman John R.

He spent his entire professional career with the family firm, Henningsen Foods Inc., founded by his grandfather in 1889.
