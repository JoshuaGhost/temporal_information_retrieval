        <p>By early Tuesday, 7 of the top 10 women's basketball teams had lost in their conference tournaments. And then there was Connecticut, which appeared immune to parity, as if by vaccination.</p>
        <p>And yet, after rolling undefeated through the Big East regular season, the second-ranked Huskies (29-3) also proved vulnerable. UConn came unraveled against Rutgers's disruptive defense, scored only 2 points in the final 7 minutes 55 seconds and lost to the Scarlet Knights, 55-47, in the final of the conference tournament on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>The Huskies played basketball like stressed apprentice jugglers, committing 17 turnovers that led to 23 Rutgers points and providing the Scarlet Knights with their first Big East tournament title after many years of frustration. UConn shot a miserable 20 of 58 (34.5 percent), drawn into the type of unnerving, low-scoring game on which Rutgers thrives.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any team in the country can simulate the kind of pressure we put on,'' Rutgers Coach C. Vivian Stringer said. ''Defense ruled tonight.''</p>
        <p>Guard Essence Carson led the Scarlet Knights with 15 points, 8 rebounds and 3 steals. Guard Epiphanny Prince collected four steals, repeatedly stripping UConn from behind in the first half. Such relentless defense provided victory for a Scarlet Knights team that shot only 20 of 60 (33 percent) from the field.</p>
        <p>''They were trying to steal the ball all the time; they caught us off guard a few times,'' said Renee Montgomery, the UConn point guard, who scored 11 points by halftime, then missed all seven of her shots in the second half.</p>
        <p>Although UConn failed in a bid to win its 14th title in 25 years of the Big East tournament, the Huskies are still expected to gain a No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament, while 19th-ranked Rutgers (22-8) is likely to receive a No. 3 or No. 4 seed.</p>
        <p>UConn will return here to the Civic Center for the first and second rounds on March 18 and 20, and is likely to be placed in a regional in Dayton, Ohio; Dallas; or Fresno, Calif. The women's Final Four will be held in Cleveland on April 1 and 3.</p>
        <p>Tuesday's victory by Rutgers deflated -- at least temporarily -- the billowing confidence of UConn Coach Geno Auriemma. When asked Monday which teams had a legitimate shot at winning the national championship, Auriemma said, ''I think we do, and whoever we're playing that night.''</p>
        <p>His peacock plumage had been on full display again after two seasons of lesser iridescence. For two months, with no Big East team able to muster a victorious fight against UConn, Auriemma had created his own scuffles to amuse himself and keep blustery instincts sharp.</p>
        <p>He threw a few rude verbal punches at Rutgers fans last month, calling them ''miserable'' and ''ignorant.'' Tuesday, though, he found himself picking on someone, or more precisely some team, his own size.</p>
        <p>The payback was harsh.</p>
        <p>''They've come to this tournament for a lot of years'' without winning, Auriemma said of the Scarlet Knights. ''I'm sure it was incredibly frustrating for them. To win it finally, and to win it here -- it's got to be the most rewarding feeling.''</p>
        <p>UConn had not lost since it fell to North Carolina on Jan. 15 and had twice defeated the Scarlet Knights during the regular season -- including by 26 points at Rutgers.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, though, the Huskies grew unsettled early, losing the ball repeatedly. The freshman center Tina Charles committed two awkward fouls and spent the last 10 minutes of the first half on the bench as Rutgers took a 29-26 lead.</p>
        <p>But Charles refused to retreat into caution. An exquisite high-low pass to forward Charde Houston put the Huskies ahead, 45-42, with 7:55 remaining. Then the Huskies went dormant, not scoring again until Houston followed a missed shot with 19.1 seconds left. In defeat, UConn's weaknesses were grimly exposed -- youth, unreliable outside shooting, a shallow bench.</p>
        <p>''We don't have a lot of margin for error to begin with,'' said Auriemma, who has no seniors.</p>
        <p>For Rutgers, Tuesday's persevering victory provided a measure of redemption during a sometimes difficult season, in which it has often struggled to score. At one point, Stringer grew impatient with her young players and would not let the team into its own locker room.</p>
        <p>Five previous times, the Scarlet Knights had lost to UConn in the Big East tournament; this helped to ferment a rivalry that has occasionally strayed from fierce to bitter. On Tuesday, Rutgers finally prevailed.</p>
        <p>''We approached this game like all games -- that the outcome was not determined until it was played,'' Stringer said. ''No one can measure human will and spirit.''</p>
