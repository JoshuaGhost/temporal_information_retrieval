        <p>Late in the third quarter last night, Lincoln High School's plan for winning the Public Schools Athletic League's AA division city championship became abundantly clear, if it was not already. Lance Stephenson demanded the ball, dribbled to his right and buried a 3-point shot.</p>
        <p>It completed a run of 7 consecutive points for Stephenson, Lincoln's star sophomore guard, and it came in a decisive quarter, when the Railsplitters extended their lead over their Brooklyn rival Boys and Girls High to 13 points from 1. They would go on to win, 77-50, at Madison Square Garden, extending a dynastic run that began under the school's previous star guard, Sebastian Telfair.</p>

        <p>Late in the third quarter last night, Lincoln High School's plan for winning the Public Schools Athletic League's AA division city championship became abundantly clear, if it was not already. Lance Stephenson demanded the ball, dribbled to his right and buried a 3-point shot.</p>
        <p>It completed a run of 7 consecutive points for Stephenson, Lincoln's star sophomore guard, and it came in a decisive quarter, when the Railsplitters extended their lead over their Brooklyn rival Boys and Girls High to 13 points from 1. They would go on to win, 77-50, at Madison Square Garden, extending a dynastic run that began under the school's previous star guard, Sebastian Telfair.</p>
        <p>This was the second consecutive P.S.A.L. championship and the fourth in five years for Lincoln (25-6), and in many ways it fit the formula the Railsplitters adhered to under Telfair. Stephenson, who made 11 of 15 shots and finished with 29 points, opened the game by making a 3-pointer, and with the exception of some foul trouble in the first half, he never really faltered.</p>
        <p>But it was not until the third quarter -- around the time a protracted series of fights broke out in the stands, distracting and displacing many of the announced crowd of 13,826 -- that Lincoln Coach Dwayne Morton finally saw what he had been looking for from Stephenson.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you've got to let Lance freelance, and sometimes you've got to get him to slow it down a little bit,'' Morton said. ''With Sebastian, you knew he was going to take over. Lance is in his second year, so he's still learning when he can do it.''</p>
        <p>The victory spoiled the dreams of Boys and Girls and Ruth Lovelace, who became the first woman to coach a boys team in a P.S.A.L. championship game. The Kangaroos (32-3) had lost two of three games against Lincoln earlier this season, but they managed to keep it close for the first two quarters.</p>
        <p>ANOTHER TITLE FOR BERGTRAUM -- Erica Morrow scored 24 points and Shanee Williams added 17 as Manhattan's Murry Bergtraum High won its ninth consecutive P.S.A.L. girls city championship, defeating John F. Kennedy High of the Bronx, 79-56.</p>

        <p>Correction:  March 28, 2007, Wednesday  A sports article in some copies on March 19, about Lincoln High School's victory against Boys and Girls High to win the Public Schools Athletic League's AA division city boys basketball championship, referred incorrectly to an accomplishment by Coach Ruth Lovelace of Boys and Girls High. With that game, she became the first woman to coach a boys team in the P.S.A.L.'s highest division championship game at Madison Square Garden -- not the first woman to coach a boys team in any championship game. (Noreen Begley was the first in 1992 when she coached the Murry Bergtraum boys to the finals in what was known as the B division.)</p>
