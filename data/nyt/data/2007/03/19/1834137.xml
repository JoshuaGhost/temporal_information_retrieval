        <p>Street Sense's victory by a nose in the Tampa Bay Derby on Saturday was a rousing return for the 2-year-old champion. On that performance alone, the colt is our Kentucky Derby favorite.</p>
        <p>By JOE DRAPE</p>
        <p>HORSE: 1. Street Sense  TRAINER: Carl Nafzger  JOCKEY: Calvin Borel  Will try to become the first Derby winner since Sunny's Halo in 1983 to have only two starts as a 3-year-old. Next: Blue Grass.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 2. Nobiz Like Shobiz  TRAINER: Barclay Tagg  JOCKEY: Cornelio Velazquez  Must rebound from a loss to Scat Daddy in the Fountain of Youth. Next: Wood Memorial.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 3. Scat Daddy  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: John Velazquez  This son of Johannesburg is tough and has a big heart. Next: Florida Derby.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 4. Any Given Saturday  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: John Velazquez  Gave Street Sense all he could handle in the stretch of the Tampa Bay Derby. Next: uncertain.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 5. Great Hunter  TRAINER: Doung O'Neill  JOCKEY: Corey Nakatani  An impressive winner of the Robert Lewis Stakes on Saturday. Next: the Blue Grass.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 6. Ravel  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: Garrett Gomez  Another of Pletcher's deep lineup. Won the Sham off a maiden victory and will try to win the Derby off only two preps. Next: Santa Anita Derby.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 7. Circular Quay  TRAINER: Todd Pletcher  JOCKEY: Garrett Gomez  The Louisiana Derby winner is 4 for 7 overall with a stone-cold-closing running style. Next: uncertain.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 8. Stormello  TRAINER: William Currin  JOCKEY: Kent Desormeaux  Hollywood Futurity champion acquitted himself well when he came east and lost by a nose to Scat Daddy in the Fountain of Youth. The six stake races he has run add to his seasoning. Next: uncertain.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 9. Notional  TRAINER: Doug O'Neill  JOCKEY: Corey Nakatani  Has won his two starts as a 3-year-old, most recently the Risen Star Stakes. Next: Florida Derby.</p>
        <p>HORSE: 10. Cobalt Blue  TRAINER: Doug O'Neill  JOCKEY: Victor Espinoza  Owned by Merv Griffin, he was a two-length winner in the San Felipe Stakes. Next: llinois Derby.</p>
