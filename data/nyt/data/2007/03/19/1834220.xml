        <p>It was the usual circle of hysteria by a team trying to get itself ready for a game in the tunnel leading out to the arena in Columbus, Ohio. But it seemed awfully loud.</p>
        <p>The curious came out from behind curtains and put down their lunches to see what the commotion was all about.</p>
        <p>Well, it was not one team but two teams getting their game faces on. Tennessee and Virginia players were jumping up and down next to one another, screaming and shouting and trying to outdo the other. The noise filled the hallways in the bowels of Nationwide Arena.</p>
        <p>It could have been news  if the two teams had been the Florida State and Miami football teams.</p>
        <p>Who was loudest? Virginia, a security guard said.</p>
