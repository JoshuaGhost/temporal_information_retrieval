      <abstract>
        <p>University of Maryland Prof Peter Morici letter holds that March 17 editorial correctly identifies downward pressure on some wages created by imports as reason for growing domestic opposition to free trade, but remedies it recommends are no more than palliatives for what is really torpedoing public support</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Trade and the Home Front'' (editorial, March 17) correctly identifies the downward pressure on some wages created by imports as a reason for growing domestic opposition to free trade. But the remedies you recommend -- upgrading the Trade Adjustment Assistance program and better education -- are no more than palliatives for what is really torpedoing public support.</p>
        <p>China and other Asian countries routinely subsidize exports and domestic industries with below-market bank credit, tax holidays and undervalued currencies. For example, China's purchase of American dollars and securities to keep the yuan cheap creates more than a 20 percent subsidy on China's exports.</p>
        <p>Were these mercantilist practices stopped, many more American products would flow out of West Coast ports to Asia. That would mean many more high-paying jobs for Americans than additional government largess could ever create.</p>
        <p>If China and others won't remove their subsidies, the best United States policy is to impose countervailing duties and tariffs that remove the artificial advantages afforded Asian products.</p>
        <p>That's not protectionism. It's self-defense.</p>
