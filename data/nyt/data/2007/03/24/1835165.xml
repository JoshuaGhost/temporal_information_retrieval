        <p>Private equity firms bidding for Qantas Airways scrambled to keep their proposal on track, extending the closing deadline by two weeks as a key shareholder rejected the terms of their offer of 11.1 billion Australian dollars ($8.9 billion).</p>
        <p>Balanced Equity Management, which holds about 4 percent of Qantas, announced that it would not accept the offer, noting: ''Since the announcement of the bid in December 2006, equity markets have appreciated significantly.'' The bidding consortium issued a terse statement in response: ''Airline Partners Australia is considering a range of alternatives in light of the announcement.'' The consortium has postponed the closing date from April 3 to April 20.</p>
