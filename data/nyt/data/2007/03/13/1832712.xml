        <p>When it came to troubling on-ice behavior in the N.H.L. last week, nothing could top the stick-swinging of Islanders forward Chris Simon.

        <p>When it came to troubling on-ice behavior in the N.H.L. last week, nothing could top the stick-swinging of Islanders forward Chris Simon. But for fans of freewheeling hockey, three games in Buffalo were raising concern because they seemed to signal the return of the neutral-zone trap.</p>
        <p>Buffalo, the highest-scoring team in the league, averaged 3.86 goals through its first 65 games. But against the Colorado Avalanche, the Minnesota Wild and the Devils -- all teams that play a permutation of the trap -- the Sabres scored a total of five goals, a 1.67 average, in three consecutive losses.</p>
        <p>''A lot of teams have been doing that against us,'' Sabres wing Jason Pominville said about the trap. ''They know we're a rush team. Colorado was waiting for us with three, sometimes four guys at the line, and Minnesota plays the same way as well.''</p>
        <p>Conventional wisdom said that after the lockout that wiped out the 2004-5 N.H.L. season, a couple of new rules would mitigate the trap's effectiveness. Two-line passes, intended to encourage teams to attempt longer passes, and stricter enforcement of obstruction seemed to limit the trap, at least for a while.</p>
        <p>Last season, teams scored 3.0 goals a game, up from 2.58 in 2003-4, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Fast, skilled teams like the Sabres thrived, providing flashbacks to the pretrap era of the 1980s.</p>
        <p>But this season, scoring has steadily edged downward. Through Sunday, teams averaged 2.90 goals.</p>
        <p>How much of that can be traced to the trap?</p>
        <p>''Everybody, whether they trap, has a checking scheme in the neutral zone,'' said Colorado Coach Joel Quenneville, whose team sometimes created a human wall against Buffalo by putting four players across its blue line. ''You can call it anything you want, but we like to call it neutral-zone checking because everybody does have a purpose out there.''</p>
        <p>Quenneville said he tinkered with different schemes throughout the season, but with the Avalanche in peril of missing the playoffs for the first time since moving from Quebec in 1995, Colorado has played a more conservative and disciplined style.</p>
        <p>In its 3-2 victory against Buffalo on Wednesday, Colorado mostly played a 1-2-2, using only one forechecker and staggering two forwards and two defenseman in the neutral zone. But the Avalanche sometimes resorted to a system of four skaters back when protecting a one-goal lead.</p>
        <p>Minnesota's Jacques Lemaire is the coach most often associated with the trap. He popularized the strategy while winning the Stanley Cup as coach of the Devils in 1994-95.</p>
        <p>Against Buffalo on Friday night, Minnesota used a 1-2-2 setup to disrupt Buffalo's offense and create turnovers that the Wild turned into odd-man rushes -- and goals. Minnesota won, 5-1.</p>
        <p>''That's our key to our success,'' Wild defenseman Keith Carney said. ''We're a team that likes to keep things tight in the neutral zone. We're trying to funnel them to an area where they can't make plays, where they can't make second passes.''</p>
        <p>Even with the departure of Lemaire as the coach, the Devils have continued to use a trapping system. In defeating Buffalo by 3-2 on Saturday, the Devils relied on a 1-2-2 strategy but sometimes sent two forecheckers deep.</p>
        <p>Other than the Devils and the Montreal Canadiens, however, the trap is mostly used by Western Conference teams. Quenneville said that St. Louis, Detroit, Vancouver and Calgary relied on it.</p>
        <p>Buffalo, the top team in the Eastern Conference virtually all season, has gone 6-3-1 against Western teams. Three of those losses came against teams that trap regularly, suggesting that the book on beating the Sabres may require reading between the blue lines.</p>
        <p>But Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff disagreed.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of people making a big deal of the offense in the East and the defense in the West,'' Ruff said, ''and the argument goes, There's better goalies in the West than there is in the East. I really don't want to debate it. I don't think the style is a lot different.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''Every team traps. Some are better than others.''</p>
        <p>According to Quenneville, eliminating the ban on two-line passing has changed the way the trap is played and made games faster and more unpredictable.</p>
        <p>''I think you coach more on both sides of the puck,'' he said. ''Before, it was strictly defensive. Now there are a lot of options in the middle of the ice. You're looking at ways of taking advantage of things on the offensive side of things.''</p>
        <p>Still, a style designed mostly for defense is offensive to some. Reports out of Chicago suggested that Dale Tallon, the general manager of the Blackhawks, fired Coach Trent Yawney earlier this season in part for using a trap.</p>
        <p>And Alex Kovalev of the Canadiens was the subject of controversy last week in Montreal when a Russian magazine reported that he criticized Coach Guy Carbonneau's trap, blaming it for his poor offensive production. Kovalev denied making the remarks.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Sabres defenseman Henrik Tallinder, willing to criticize of the trap publicly, summed it up best.</p>
        <p>''We knew before the game that they would have four guys back,'' he said about Colorado. ''It was a boring game.''</p>
