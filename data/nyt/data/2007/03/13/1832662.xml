        <p>It's not quite a link-up between the Montagues and the Capulets, but in this superheated political environment it comes close. John Weaver, right, the senior strategist to Senator John McCain of Arizona, is marrying Angela Hession, who was the deputy chief of staff to Rudolph W. Giuliani right through his last day as mayor of New York at the end of 2001. Mr. Weaver and Ms. Hession met when he went to New York after the Sept. 11 attacks to help the city with communication efforts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hession left Mr. Giuliani's inner circle when his term ended. In addition to marrying Mr. Weaver this summer, she is also now a strategist for Mr. McCain, who is Mr. Giuliani's chief rival at this point for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>

        <p>It's not quite a link-up between the Montagues and the Capulets, but in this superheated political environment it comes close. John Weaver, right, the senior strategist to Senator John McCain of Arizona, is marrying Angela Hession, who was the deputy chief of staff to Rudolph W. Giuliani right through his last day as mayor of New York at the end of 2001. Mr. Weaver and Ms. Hession met when he went to New York after the Sept. 11 attacks to help the city with communication efforts.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hession left Mr. Giuliani's inner circle when his term ended. In addition to marrying Mr. Weaver this summer, she is also now a strategist for Mr. McCain, who is Mr. Giuliani's chief rival at this point for the Republican presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Not that this should make the Giuliani camp nervous a bit. ''They've known about it for a long time,'' Mr. Weaver said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Weaver said, Mr. Giuliani's aides had even called to offer congratulations.</p>
        <p>Being a political couple, Mr. Weaver and Ms. Hession are now struggling to find a date for the wedding in this busy season: sometime between the Republican straw poll in Iowa in early August and Labor Day. No word yet on whether Mr. McCain -- or Mr. Giuliani -- will make the guest list.</p>
