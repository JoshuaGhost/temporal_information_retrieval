        <p>Airline passengers who feel reassured when they glimpse a shock of white hair in the cockpit may be on to something.</p>
        <p>A new study finds that in pilots, the declines in physical and thinking skills that come with age may be outweighed by their years of experience.</p>
        <p>Writing in the February issue of Neurology, researchers described the results of a study in which 118 pilots, ages 40 to 69, were repeatedly tested in a flight simulator over three years. The study was led by Joy L. Taylor of the Stanford/VA Aging Clinical Research Center.</p>
        <p>In general, the researchers found, older pilots did not do as well the first time they used the simulators, which tested skills in communicating with air traffic controllers, avoiding traffic, keeping track of cockpit instruments and landing. The tests involved piloting a single-engine aircraft over flat terrain near mountains.</p>
        <p>But as the tests were repeated over the period of the study, the older pilots' skills declined less than the younger ones' did. In traffic avoidance, all the pilots' skills improved over time, but the older pilots improved more than the younger ones. The study also found that pilots with more training scored better on the tests at the beginning, and showed less decline over time.</p>
        <p>Under current regulations, commercial airline pilots must retire at age 60, but some pilots are pushing to work longer, and the results of this study may add to the debate. The researchers suggest that it may not be enough to assess pilots' ability to stay in the job by using just the ordinary array of generalized skills tests.</p>
        <p>The issue, they say, is that these tests do not measure the specific skills pilots have attained over the years. Studies have shown that in many fields requiring expertise, from typing to music, those skills remain even after others fade.</p>
