      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>On Sunday afternoon at City Center, Paul Taylor resurrected a period piece, or more accurately, a ''Piece Period,'' but however one wishes to read the title, the dance is a vintage delight. The work for 10, not seen in New York since 1979, was originally created for 6 performers, including Mr. Taylor, at Hunter Playhouse in 1962. That the comic spoof of national dance styles followed the creation of ''Aureole,'' one of Mr. Taylor's most pure dance works, is indeed a clear indication of his restless mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor takes many liberties in ''Piece Period,'' which unfolds in seven sections and one interlude, with music by Vivaldi, Telemann, Haydn, Scarlatti, Beethoven and Bonporti. Essentially exploring historical period dances through his witty and somewhat twisted lens, Mr. Taylor affectionately mocks court rituals by using them as a platform for his impeccably timed humor.</p>

        <p>On Sunday afternoon at City Center, Paul Taylor resurrected a period piece, or more accurately, a ''Piece Period,'' but however one wishes to read the title, the dance is a vintage delight. The work for 10, not seen in New York since 1979, was originally created for 6 performers, including Mr. Taylor, at Hunter Playhouse in 1962. That the comic spoof of national dance styles followed the creation of ''Aureole,'' one of Mr. Taylor's most pure dance works, is indeed a clear indication of his restless mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor takes many liberties in ''Piece Period,'' which unfolds in seven sections and one interlude, with music by Vivaldi, Telemann, Haydn, Scarlatti, Beethoven and Bonporti. Essentially exploring historical period dances through his witty and somewhat twisted lens, Mr. Taylor affectionately mocks court rituals by using them as a platform for his impeccably timed humor.</p>
        <p>Still, with his light touch and eye for detail, ''Piece Period'' is more imaginative than a broad parody, beginning with ''Uno,'' performed by Richard Chen See in the role originated by Mr. Taylor. With fluttery footwork -- Mr. Chen See traverses the stage in tiny crossing steps and sinks into comically low, wide pliés, sticking his rear in the air -- he is a jester missing a court.</p>
        <p>The fanciful costumes and set, which includes a chandelier made of Ping-Pong balls and richly colored drops by John Rawlings, are an integral part of the production's storybook playfulness. In ''Drei'' Robert Kleinendorst wears a powdered wig; during his solo a hand extends from the wings offering beer in a stein. (He downs it with gusto.)</p>
        <p>During ''Five,'' a trio for Annmaria Mazzini, Amy Young and Michelle Fleet, the dancers wear Elizabethan ruffs and full velvet skirts that graze the floor as they move in unison. With their elbows bent and forearms extended to either side like handlebars on a bicycle, they wiggle their limp wrists, making a mockery of their supposed decorum. In the boisterous finale the dances, so whimsically distorted by Mr. Taylor, fit together like a preposterous puzzle.</p>
        <p>The program also included Mr. Taylor's ''Banquet of Vultures.'' A tour de force for the ferocious Michael Trusnovec, this antiwar dance, lighted to sinister perfection by Jennifer Tipton, is one of Mr. Taylor's most painterly and haunting works. Reprieve came in ''Esplanade,'' Mr. Taylor's invigorating 1975 dance that makes the most of simple steps: skipping, running, jumping and falling.</p>
        <p>''Esplanade'' remains something of a brilliant sunset after a day of soaking rain, captivating for more than the innocence of its movement. The costumes are designed once again by Mr. Rawlings, whom Mr. Taylor described in his autobiography, ''Private Domain,'' as ''one of the few people I've ever really collaborated with.''</p>
        <p>Just as Mr. Rawlings's designs are given new life in the revival of ''Piece Period,'' his simple dresses, trousers and fitted shirts in ''Esplanade,'' along with his immaculate sense of construction and color -- a cascade of orange, pink and fawn -- are still a revelation. Mr. Rawlings dresses more than the dancers; he dresses the stage.</p>
        <p>The Paul Taylor Dance Company performs through March 18 at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 581-1212.</p>
