        <p>A federal judge approved a preliminary settlement between the City of Chicago and lawyers who alleged that the city had violated a federal decree prohibiting the awarding of jobs and promotions to politically connected applicants. The ban, in effect since 1983, applies to about 37,000 city jobs. Among other provisions, the settlement calls for a $12 million fund to pay claims of $100,000 or less to individuals who say they were discriminated against Accusations of corruption in hiring have dogged the administration of Mayor Richard M. Daley. In 2005, a federal monitor was appointed to keep watch on the city's hiring practices.</p>
