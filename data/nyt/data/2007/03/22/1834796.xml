        <p>John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat making a second bid for the presidency, called a news conference for Thursday to discuss the future of his campaign, a day after he and his wife, Elizabeth, visited Mrs. Edwards' doctor to assess her recovery from a bout of breast cancer.</p>

        <p>John Edwards, the North Carolina Democrat making a second bid for the presidency, called a news conference for Thursday to discuss the future of his campaign, a day after he and his wife, Elizabeth, visited Mrs. Edwards' doctor to assess her recovery from a bout of breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Edwards, in a brief interview from her home in Chapel Hill, N.C., said she and Mr. Edwards would discuss her health at the news conference, but she declined to elaborate.</p>
        <p>''I'm still here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Palmieri, communications director for the Edwards campaign, would not comment.</p>
        <p>The news conference is to be held in Chapel Hill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards canceled a campaign appearance in Iowa on Wednesday to join his wife on what he had described as a presumably routine follow-up examination.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Edwards, 57, received a cancer diagnosis in 2004 almost on the day that Mr. Edwards, the vice-presidential candidate, and Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, were defeated in their race for the White House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Edwards has said he waited to announce a second bid for the presidency until he and Mrs. Edwards's doctors were confident about her recovery.</p>
        <p>Since then, he had established himself as a strong third contender in a race that includes Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois. A decision by Mr. Edwards to withdraw, should he decide to do that, could have a profound impact on the dynamics of the Democratic contest.</p>
        <p>After the campaign announced its intention to hold the news conference, concern grew quickly among former and current aides to the Edwards family. One close family friend reached Wednesday evening declined to comment on the announcement, but said it would affect, at least temporarily, the future of the campaign.</p>
        <p>A leading contributor to the campaign, speaking on condition of anonymity, said organizers had not been notified to cancel a long string of events scheduled before the end of March, the deadline for the first-quarter financial reports.</p>
        <p>During the 2004 presidential race, Mrs. Edwards became a fixture on the campaign trail. She often would be dispatched to blue-collar settings, hardly stereotypical audiences for a political spouse. Her military upbringing, she once said, made her perfectly suited for a life on the road.</p>
