        <p>A Congressional committee has begun an inquiry into the marketing and regulation of widely used anemia drugs that have recently raised safety concerns.</p>
        <p>The House Committee on Energy and Commerce has sent letters to Amgen and Johnson &amp; Johnson, the drugs' marketers, requesting information about when they knew of possible risks and about how they have promoted the products.</p>
        <p>The letters also asked them to suspend any consumer advertising of the drugs and any incentive programs for doctors who prescribe them until after the Food and Drug Administration has time to determine whether further safety precautions are necessary.</p>
        <p>The products -- Epogen and Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &amp; Johnson -- are all forms of erythropoietin, or Epo, a protein made by the human kidney to spur production of red blood cells. The drugs are mainly used to treat the anemia caused by kidney failure or cancer chemotherapy and have combined worldwide sales of roughly $10 billion a year.</p>
        <p>On March 9, the F.D.A. and the companies agreed to put a ''black box'' warning, the most serious kind, on the drugs' labels after new evidence showed the medicines might cause blood clots, worsen cancer or increase the risk of death if overused.</p>
        <p>In its letters, the lawmakers said they viewed the reports of safety issues ''with increasing alarm,'' adding that as much as $700 million in annual sales of the three drugs were from uses that did not conform to the label.</p>
        <p>An F.D.A. advisory panel is scheduled to meet May 10 to further discuss the safety of the drugs. In issuing its warning last week, the F.D.A. said the companies had agreed to suspend direct-to-consumer advertising of the drugs on television and radio until after the advisory committee meeting.</p>
        <p>David Polk, a spokesman for Amgen, said Wednesday that the company had never directly advertised Epogen or Aranesp to consumers and did not provide financial incentives to doctors. He said the company would cooperate with the inquiry and that it believed the drugs were safe if used in accordance with the label.</p>
        <p>Kassy McGourty, a spokeswoman for Johnson &amp; Johnson, said the company had not conducted direct-to-consumer advertising for Procrit since 2005. She said the company could not yet comment.</p>
        <p>The letters, dated Tuesday, were signed by John D. Dingell, the committee's chairman, and Bart Stupak, the chairman of its Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, both Michigan Democrats. The Republican leaders of the committee and subcommittee did not sign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dingell and Mr. Stupak said in the letters that the questions about the anemia drugs were part of a larger inquiry into whether the F.D.A. was adequately protecting the public from the risks of prescription medicines.</p>
        <p>Many of the questions to the companies were about their communications with the F.D.A. The lawmakers also asked when the companies had learned about suspensions of clinical trials for safety issues and when they had notified the regulators.</p>
