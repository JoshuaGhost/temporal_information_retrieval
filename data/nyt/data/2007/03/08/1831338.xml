        <p>''Wallpaper,'' by Lachlan Blackley (Laurence King, $40), is a delirious catalog of work by mostly European artists and designers showing how the ornamental and the decorative play nicely as art. Front, a two-year-old Swedish design collective, made one of the best examples, a photosensitive paper that is white until the sun hits it and then its pattern, a repeat of a still life of iconic Nordic design objects -- a vase, a lamp, a mug -- develops. Even better is ''Rat Wallpaper,'' which was actually made by gerbils, left, who gnawed through rolls of white paper, making a lacy pattern (the holes let a previous paper show through, below). ''They were fantastic,'' said Katja Savstrom, one of Front's four designers. ''They are really hard workers.'' Sadly, both papers are still in prototype only.
