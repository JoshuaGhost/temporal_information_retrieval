        <p>Everything seemed to be running smoothly at the gala evening for the Paul Taylor Dance Company on Tuesday at City Center. The curtain rose on time, the inevitable latecomers weren't disruptive, and for once there were no unnecessary speeches by board members about the breathtaking art of dance.</p>
        <p>So while it was unfortunate that the sound system suffered a meltdown during Mr. Taylor's new ''Lines of Loss,'' it wasn't catastrophic. The dancers, heroic and alert, maintained their composure and danced in silence, creating a performance to remember. ''Lines of Loss'' had its premiere on Friday night, but not enough praise can be heaped upon Mr. Taylor's incredible new dance, which seems to be, at its core, a brutal, personal exploration of life and loss.</p>

        <p>Everything seemed to be running smoothly at the gala evening for the Paul Taylor Dance Company on Tuesday at City Center. The curtain rose on time, the inevitable latecomers weren't disruptive, and for once there were no unnecessary speeches by board members about the breathtaking art of dance.</p>
        <p>So while it was unfortunate that the sound system suffered a meltdown during Mr. Taylor's new ''Lines of Loss,'' it wasn't catastrophic. The dancers, heroic and alert, maintained their composure and danced in silence, creating a performance to remember. ''Lines of Loss'' had its premiere on Friday night, but not enough praise can be heaped upon Mr. Taylor's incredible new dance, which seems to be, at its core, a brutal, personal exploration of life and loss.</p>
        <p>As the music crackled and popped and, for a spell, dipped out entirely, Annmaria Mazzini, in her darkly heartbreaking solo, didn't miss a beat. Her breathing was audible, lending her deep, piercing contractions and arching backbends a desperation that seemed to penetrate the deepest, saddest part of this choreographer's soul.</p>
        <p>In ''Aureole,'' Mr. Taylor's sunny, deceptively difficult 1962 dance set to Handel that began the program, Ms. Mazzini also dazzled, imbuing the sharpest of steps with playful sensuality. The tall, muscular Orion Duckstein, performing Mr. Taylor's famed adagio solo for the first time in New York, looked marvelous in his white leotard but had problems holding his balances and, more critically, growing into them.</p>
        <p>The program, which closed with Mr. Taylor's joyous 1981 ''Arden Court,'' also showcased the New York premiere of ''Troilus and Cressida (reduced),'' a romp through Shakespeare's tragicomedy, set to Ponchielli's ''Dance of the Hours.'' The program note, credited to Shakespeare, reads only, ''O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!'' In ''Troilus and Cressida'' Mr. Taylor strips the characters down to three Cupids (Julie Tice, Parisa Khobdeh and Eran Bugge), three Greek invaders (James Samson, Sean Mahoney and Jeffrey Smith) and, most important, the stellar comic team of Lisa Viola as Cressida and Robert Kleinendorst as Troilus.</p>
        <p>Featuring a handsome blue and gold backdrop and appropriately fussy costumes by Santo Loquasto, the production resembles a diorama and the dancers Looney Tunes characters. Ms. Viola, supremely awkward in a short violet dress, lurches and crashes, swatting away the overambitious cupids with hilarious petulance. Mr. Kleinendorst, even more ridiculous in purple velvet, is a broken-down son of a king who never manages to straighten out of his dejected slump, even when lifting Ms. Viola overhead.</p>
        <p>With ''Troilus and Cressida'' Mr. Taylor has perhaps finally created his own version of ''Fantasia,'' the Walt Disney film he has cited in interviews as being an influence since he watched it as a boy. Mr. Taylor, impossibly cagy, isn't above exaggerating for the fun of it, but with the sliver of hilarity that is ''Troilus and Cressida,'' that early inspiration seems real after all.</p>
        <p>The Paul Taylor Dance Company performs through March 18 at City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org.</p>
