        <p>Editorial supports measure sponsored by New Jersey Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle that would put voting record of each state senator and Assembly member online, with daily updates</p>

        <p>It would be an important move toward open government. The New Jersey Legislature seems about to put the voting record of each state senator and Assembly member online. As things stand now, it is virtually impossible for the public to see in one-easy-to-find location how legislators voted on every measure before their house.</p>
        <p>The Assembly this month unanimously approved a bill requiring the postings on the Legislature's Web site, njleg.state.nj.us. The Senate passed the bill last year; its long delay in the Assembly seemed to reflect a lack of zeal among some members for open government. The sponsor, Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle, a Democrat from Bergen County,said she rescued the measure from the back burner only when she realized that National Sunshine Week promoting transparent government was about to begin.</p>

        <p>The bill has one more legislative step to go. Because the Assembly added an amendment requiring daily updating, the measure must be approved all over again by the Senate. Supporters of the bill are confident that this will happen when the Legislature reconvenes in May. Finally, voters will able to easily find out for themselves where and how their legislators stand.</p>
