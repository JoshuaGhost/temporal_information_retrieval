        <p>The Legal Center for My Sisters' Place, a nonprofit group based in White Plains that aids victims of domestic violence, celebrated its 10th anniversary this month.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Noto, a lawyer and former county legislator, said he had been a board member of My Sisters' Place for five years. ''People don't realize how prevalent it is,'' he said of domestic violence. ''Sometimes, when it impacts wealthy families, they're less likely to seek help at a shelter. They fear the social ostracism.''</p>

        <p>The Legal Center for My Sisters' Place, a nonprofit group based in White Plains that aids victims of domestic violence, celebrated its 10th anniversary this month.</p>
        <p>Paul J. Noto, a lawyer and former county legislator, said he had been a board member of My Sisters' Place for five years. ''People don't realize how prevalent it is,'' he said of domestic violence. ''Sometimes, when it impacts wealthy families, they're less likely to seek help at a shelter. They fear the social ostracism.''</p>
        <p>Judy Kaminstein, the owner of Casabella, a household-cleaning-product business in Blauvelt, N.Y., said she joined the board of My Sisters' Place nine years ago. ''This organization works on the issue on a holistic level, looking at the woman as a whole person,'' she said.</p>
        <p>That means helping women with everything from health care issues to legal advice to job training -- an approach, she said, that is not that common across the country, ''although I think people are starting to realize it's the right way to go.''</p>
        <p>The organization, which receives almost half of its budget from the county and the rest from other government grants and fund-raising efforts, runs two emergency shelters, a 15-bed home in Yonkers for women and their children and an 18-bed shelter in Mamaroneck for women.</p>
        <p>''We do safety planning for every person who comes in,'' Karen Cheeks-Lomax, the group's executive director, said. ''All our staff is trained to do that.''</p>
        <p>The organization invited Anita F. Hill, a professor of social policy, law and women's studies at Brandeis University, to speak at the group's fund-raising dinner held in Rye Brook.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hill became well known during the tumultuous Senate hearings on Clarence Thomas's nomination to the United States Supreme Court in 1991 after she testified that he had sexually harassed her when she worked for him years before. Justice Thomas denied the allegations.</p>
        <p>In her speech, Ms. Hill decried popular culture's attempts at humor involving potential violence toward women, using as an example, ''The Honeymooners,'' the television series of the 1950's, which regularly featured Ralph Kramden threatening to send his wife, Alice, ''to the moon!''</p>
        <p>''I know there were women who knew what real brutality lay behind those words,'' Ms. Hill said. ''They weren't laughing at all.''</p>
