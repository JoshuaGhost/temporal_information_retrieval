        <p>THIS was a crowd in desperate need of being warmed up. On a March night that felt like the coldest of the year, a few dozen young comedy fans who had lined up in Chelsea expecting to attend a late-night showcase called Crash Test instead found themselves transported by van to the westernmost edge of 26th Street, to shiver in front of an MTV camera crew.</p>
        <p>In exchange for a cup of coffee or hot chocolate, the brave, trembling souls had agreed to play extras in a skit for ''Human Giant,'' a new series starring Crash Test's hosts, Aziz Ansari, Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Earlier that week the ''Human Giant'' squad had devised a scene about a pair of illusionists whose stunts typically end in carnage and property damage; now they were trying to shoot the sequence as swiftly as possible, and get back to the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in time for the 11 p.m. set.</p>

        <p>THIS was a crowd in desperate need of being warmed up. On a March night that felt like the coldest of the year, a few dozen young comedy fans who had lined up in Chelsea expecting to attend a late-night showcase called Crash Test instead found themselves transported by van to the westernmost edge of 26th Street, to shiver in front of an MTV camera crew.</p>
        <p>In exchange for a cup of coffee or hot chocolate, the brave, trembling souls had agreed to play extras in a skit for ''Human Giant,'' a new series starring Crash Test's hosts, Aziz Ansari, Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer. Earlier that week the ''Human Giant'' squad had devised a scene about a pair of illusionists whose stunts typically end in carnage and property damage; now they were trying to shoot the sequence as swiftly as possible, and get back to the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in time for the 11 p.m. set.</p>
        <p>Dressed in a fright wig and jumpsuit, Mr. Ansari was talking into a megaphone, trying to keep the volunteers entertained. ''Now you're part of TV magic!'' he shouted.</p>
        <p>The extras may not have felt that they were participating in history -- if they could feel anything at all -- but they were bearing witness to a significant shift in the comedy landscape. For comedians who aspire to break into television, it's no longer necessary to spend years cracking one-liners at stand-up clubs in hopes of landing an HBO special or a sidekick role on a network sitcom. With clever material, an act that mixes live skits and multimedia, and, especially, some savvy use of the Internet, members of a young comedy troupe can suddenly find themselves starring in their own cable series.</p>
        <p>At least that's how it's worked for Human Giant, which came together as a group way back in 2005 and now has an MTV show making its debut on April 5. ''Human Giant is just a name we made up last year,'' said Jason Woliner, the nonperforming member of the quartet, who directs and edits the videotaped segments. ''A month later we were taking meetings and people were like, 'We want that Human Giant vibe.' ''</p>
        <p>Last week the music channel Fuse began running its own sketch series, ''The Whitest Kids U'Know,'' starring the Brooklyn-based comedy quintet of the same name, whose founding members met as students at the School of Visual Arts. ''We wanted to make a show that we would have loved when we were younger,'' said the Whitest Kids' frontman, Trevor Moore, who is all of 26. ''The dirty little show you have to hide from your parents.''</p>
        <p>Both shows share an aesthetic that favors rapid-fire, character-driven skits tending toward the absurd, about electronics-store clerks with sinister ulterior motives, naughty woodland animals who seduce their hunters and, of course, Hitler. They wear on their sleeves the influence of comedic institutions like ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'' and ''Saturday Night Live,'' as well as less celebrated 1980s and 1990s touchstones like ''The Kids in the Hall,'' ''The Ben Stiller Show,'' ''The State'' and ''Mr. Show With Bob and David.''</p>
        <p>And both Human Giant and the Whitest Kids have benefited from a trend in the New York comedy scene, where traditional stand-up clubs have been complemented by more experimental downtown sites that attract a younger audience. ''People our age, they don't have money, and you feel sort of guilty if they're paying to get in,'' Mr. Moore said. ''We're the Colt 45 and ramen generation.''</p>
        <p>Though some members of these troupes are relatively young, they were performing comedy before they could legally drink: Mr. Moore was the host of his own public-access show when he was 16, and Mr. Ansari, 24, has been performing stand-up since his freshman year of college in 2001.</p>
        <p>The Internet is a fundamental component of their acts. Both groups routinely produce their own comedy shorts and post them on the Web, not because they need to, but because they can. ''We're not the most experienced film students,'' Mr. Huebel of Human Giant said. ''We do it kind of run and gun, and figure it out as we go along.'' While they were goofing around with computer software like Final Cut and After Effects, their online efforts became widely traded on comedy blogs and YouTube.</p>
        <p>The television industry was also taking notice of this evolving marketplace: NBC, TBS and Comedy Central established Web sites where users could post comedy clips, and ''Saturday Night Live'' made digital shorts like ''Lazy Sunday'' a regular part of its lineup. It was only a matter of time before a network gave some new group an entire series. ''We were thinking the next step would be to make a pilot on our own,'' Mr. Woliner said, ''and before we could do that, MTV just came to us.''</p>
        <p>The music channels behind ''The Whitest Kids U'Know'' and ''Human Giant'' see in these acts a rebellious quality lacking in many of the contemporary rock and pop bands whose videos they broadcast. ''This radical behavior, this distinct point of view, this kind of guerrilla experience that makes you rowdy and not want to conform is something that you can express in comedy to the extreme,'' said Jennifer Caserta, the general manager of Fuse.</p>
        <p>Of course there are compelling financial incentives for Fuse and MTV to schedule comedy shows. ''Get a breakout title like 'Chappelle's Show,' and sell three million copies on DVD at $25 apiece, and you'll find 75 million reasons for MTV to invest in comedy,'' said Nate Sloan, the editor of the comedy blog The Apiary (theapiary.org).</p>
        <p>But some wonder if these new series have less to do with the networks' commitment to emerging comedy groups than with their desire to please a fickle youth audience. ''Trying to figure out MTV's programming strategy is like trying to interpret hieroglyphics,'' said Amelie Gillette, an editor at The Onion's arts and entertainment section, the A.V. Club, who writes a blog called The Hater. ''You can only have so many date-my-mom shows. And the only thing I know about Fuse is 'Pants-Off Dance-Off,' and I have no idea why that's on the air.''</p>
        <p>As with anything that ends up on the Internet, the Whitest Kids and Human Giant have found it difficult to protect the unique sensibilities that first got them attention. They have already noticed a surge in comedy troupes that make short films or videos.</p>
        <p>''It seems like it's pretty competitive now,'' Mr. Ansari said. ''You see things like 'Lazy Sunday' and you think, 'Aw, man, me and my buddies can shoot that.' I think we got really lucky in our timing.''</p>
        <p>Last month the Whitest Kids received some unintended publicity when fans spotted a Budweiser commercial on the Super Bowl that bore an uncomfortably close resemblance to one of their viral video skits, about guys who greet their friends by slapping them across the face.</p>
        <p>''The tone of it just seemed so blatant,'' said Mr. Moore, whose group quickly issued a press release pointing out the similarities but is not pursuing a lawsuit. ''We wanted to get it out there, let as many people as possible know that we're not ripping people off.'' But then, Mr. Moore said, he is used to seeing his work misappropriated by others: ''I had the idea for the second Iraq war like 10 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Comedians who have already been through the television wringer cautioned that these groups would continue to face challenges even if their shows are successful. ''Failure is easy because the thing will dissolve, and you have a group hug and walk into the sunset,'' said Michael Ian Black, who was just 22 when his comedy troupe, the State, was given its own MTV series. ''Success is a lot more complicated, because it brings temptation for individual members to leave and be in movies, or jump ship to 'Saturday Night Live,' or do any number of things that may present themselves.</p>
        <p>''At the same time it's kind of like, so what? They may only be doing these shows for six months, but hey, someone's giving them a shot. Why should they say no?''</p>
        <p>There's only one way for these acts to find out if they're ready to carry their own television shows, and that's by going out there and doing them.</p>
        <p>''When you're ready is relative,'' said Tom Gianas, a comedy veteran who has directed stage shows for Sarah Silverman, Bob Odenkirk and Michael Moore, and who is the show runner on ''Human Giant.'' ''It's not necessarily an age thing or an experience thing. Having a voice, knowing who you are, that's what helps, and that takes time to find.''</p>
        <p>Whether their series last eight seasons or eight episodes, these young comedians are certain the Internet will continue to play a crucial role in bringing new talent to television.</p>
        <p>''Until we all develop psychic powers and are finding our comedy on the astral plane, it's where networks are going to go to find their shows,'' said Zach Cregger, a member of the Whitest Kids U'Know. ''If networks even continue to exist.''</p>
