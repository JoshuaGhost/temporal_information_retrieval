        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''North Haven, Big-Box Central,Shifts Gears'' (March 18) describes a change in development for North Haven, from big-box stores to smartgrowth developments, through a zoning</p>
        <p>amendment passed by the town.</p>
        <p>At the public hearing, the developers spent no time discussing the language in the amendment they proposed and wrote, and most of their time pitching their development. The members of the zoning commission spent most of their speaking time fawning over the developers, and no time questioning whether the language in the amendment is the best vehicle for bringing smart-growth development to North Haven.</p>
        <p>In the end, the developers will decide whatever happens in North Haven, and ''smart growth'' will be whatever the developers want it to be. Zoning regulations are an essential component of ensuring proper smart-growth development. It's important that zoning boards think critically about the language in them.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article doesn't answer the most important question about Rabina Properties' proposal for North Haven: Where is it?</p>
        <p>Rabina's Web site, under ''Newsworthy'' on its home page, links to a September 2005 press release promising construction to begin in ''the second half of 2006,'' on a space that has serious pollution problems. According to your article, Rabina representatives now say they expect to break ground in less than two years.</p>
        <p>There was a town election in November 2005. There is another one coming up. Our commercial tax base is in trouble. Those are facts. The Rabina development is still a fantasy, as is the 20 percent projected increase in the property tax base.</p>
        <p>I'm surprised you didn't quote James J. Giulietti, the one zoning commission member who voted against the zoning change. He didn't oppose the development, but wanted to know more.</p>
