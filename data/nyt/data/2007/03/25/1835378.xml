        <p>When the AMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA played its first concert, in 1977, there was nothing quite like it. This full symphony orchestra was formed to play music by American composers, from Serialists and neo-Romantics to Minimalists (and beyond), and from early-20th-century classics to newly commissioned scores. DENNIS RUSSELL DAVIES, the orchestra's conductor from its founding until 2002, returns Monday to lead a 30th-anniversary program. This typically eclectic venture includes Tania León's ''Indígena,'' as well as a handful of concertos in which the composers are the soloists. They include Steven Mackey's ''Deal'' (for electric guitar), ''Inventions'' by the jazz pianist Vijay Iyer, Kurt Rohde's ''White Boy/Man Invisible'' (for viola), Harold Meltzer's ''Virginal'' (for harpsichord), Andrew McKenna Lee's ''Arabescata'' (for guitar) and Min Xiao-Fen's ''Blue Pipa'' (for the pipa, a Chinese lute). 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $32 to $40.</p>
        <p>NEW SOUNDS LIVE, the concert hall spinoff of John Schaefer's new-music show on WNYC-FM (93.9), offers a tantalizing mixture of the antique and the modern on Wednesday. TRIO MEDIAEVAL, the Norwegian vocal ensemble, mostly performs very old music, as its name suggests, but also recent works composed for it. Also on the bill is the CRASH ENSEMBLE, an Irish chamber group that will perform two new works by a compatriot, Donnacha Dennehy. 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $35 in advance, $40 at the door.</p>
        <p>The violinist MIRANDA CUCKSON has enlivened many a new-music concert in recent seasons, but there is more to her than that. At a recital on Sunday with THOMAS BAGWELL, the pianist, Ms. Cuckson will play works by Copland, Paul Schoenfield, Schubert and Brahms. 3 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920, mapc.com; $15, $10 for students and 65+.</p>
        <p>If you're a fan of PAUL MORAVEC's music, you may have to do some sprinting on Thursday: his ''Tempest Fantasy,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize in 2004, is included on a program by the TRIO SOLISTI and the clarinetist ALAN KAY. Works by Mendelssohn and Piazzolla are also on the program. 7:30 p.m., Thalia at Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $21 in advance, $25 at the door. A few miles south, at Carnegie Hall, the superb flutist MARYA MARTIN is including Mr. Moravec's ''Marya's Song'' in her all-contemporary program, ''The Flute Book of the 21st Century,'' which includes scores by Eve Beglarian, Kenji Bunch, Chen Yi, Melissa Hui, Tania León, Ned Rorem and David Sanford. 8 p.m., Weill Recital Hall; $15.</p>
