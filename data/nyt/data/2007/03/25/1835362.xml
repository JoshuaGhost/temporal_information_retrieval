        <p>Spruce Peak at Stowe, the Vermont ski destination's new base-area development, is the first mountain resort in the country to have earned the Audubon Green Community Award from Audubon International. Some of the property's practices include protecting more than 2,000 acres of wildlife habitat; financial support of the Stowe Municipal trolley system and bike path; and a transfer gondola that eliminates the need for bus transfers (www.livestowe.com).  Campers and road-trippers looking for an environmentally friendly, fast and easy way to wash clothes might want to visit www.laundry-alternative.com, which is selling a mechanism called the Wonderwash. It is compact (12 by 12 by 16 inches), requires no electricity and uses 90 percent less water and detergent than a conventional washing machine. The Wonderwash, which costs $42.95, uses a hand-cranked pressure system that can wash five pounds of clothing in a few minutes.  Travelers visiting Charleston, S.C., for the Spoleto Festival will also be able to enjoy a new exhibition at the Gibbes Museum of Art, ''Rodin: In His Own Words: Selections from the Iris &amp; B. Gerald Cantor Foundation,'' on view May 25 through Aug. 12. The exhibition, which features about 30 original bronze casts of Auguste Rodin's sculptures, including ''Venus'' (left), also includes written works by the artist (www.gibbesmuseum.org).  Norwegian Coastal Voyage Escorted Vacations is offering a 16-day trip, Scandinavian Smorgasbord, which goes by train, bus and cruise from Stockholm, to Copenhagen, Oslo, Lapland and the Lofoten Islands. Prices are $5,369 to $6,709 a person, double occupancy, and include airfare from New York, most meals and first-class hotels. There is a discount of up to $275 a person for booking by March 31. Trips are available from June 21 to Sept. 14. Go to www.norwegiancoastalvoyage.us and click on Vacations.</p>
