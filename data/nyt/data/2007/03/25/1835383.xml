        <p>Pegged to the fury of March Madness, HBO brings us ''THE UCLA DYNASTY'' (Monday at 10 p.m.), a documentary exploring the legend that was the men's basketball team of the University of California, Los Angeles, in the 1960s and '70s. Under the stewardship of the coach, John Wooden, now 96, and interviewed here, the Bruins captured an astonishing 12 N.C.A.A. championship titles from 1964 to 1975 and ignited a national fever over college basketball that has yet to cool down.</p>
        <p>The baby boomers who came of age during that period receive their very own tribute in ''THE BOOMER CENTURY: 1946-2046,'' another documentary, which will appear on PBS on Wednesday at 9 p.m. What more needs to be said of the narcissistic generation? The film doesn't just reflect wistfully on the Woodstock years -- because really, who could stand that? It examines how boomer psychology has shaped the market and the marketplace of ideas, for better and for worse. The great question of how boomers will handle retirement is explored too. Look forward to (or run away from) interviews with Oliver Stone, Erica Jong and Dr. Andrew Weil, among others.</p>
        <p>You've been aching to see them together again, and, your dream will no longer be denied. On Tuesday at 10 p.m., Jennifer Aniston makes a guest appearance on the season finale of FX's ''DIRT,'' the tabloid drama starring her former ''Friends'' cast mate Courteney Cox. Ms. Aniston will play a rival editor to Ms. Cox's Lucy Spiller, and she will play a lesbian.</p>
