        <p>Thousands of doctors and other health professionals who participate in Medicare are delinquent in paying federal income and payroll taxes, owing more than $1.3 billion, but they continue to receive Medicare payments because the government does little to check their background, federal investigators said Monday.</p>
        <p>''Many of these individuals accumulated substantial wealth and assets, including million-dollar houses and luxury vehicles, while failing to pay their federal taxes,'' the investigators said. ''One physician gambled millions of dollars at the same time the individual owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal taxes.''</p>

        <p>Thousands of doctors and other health professionals who participate in Medicare are delinquent in paying federal income and payroll taxes, owing more than $1.3 billion, but they continue to receive Medicare payments because the government does little to check their background, federal investigators said Monday.</p>
        <p>''Many of these individuals accumulated substantial wealth and assets, including million-dollar houses and luxury vehicles, while failing to pay their federal taxes,'' the investigators said. ''One physician gambled millions of dollars at the same time the individual owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in federal taxes.''</p>
        <p>The findings are set forth in a report from the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan watchdog agency, to the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which plans to hold a hearing on the problem on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Medicare has no mechanism to prevent doctors who are delinquent on their taxes from receiving the payments, the report said.</p>
        <p>Gregory D. Kutz, director of forensic audits and special investigations at the G.A.O., said more than 21,000 health care providers, mostly doctors, had tax debts totaling $1.3 billion as of last Sept. 30. That amount reflects tax liabilities that have been acknowledged by taxpayers or certified by a court. The number almost certainly understates the amount owed because it does not include the obligations of people who failed to file tax returns or understated their incomes, Mr. Kutz said.</p>
        <p>About half the amount owed was individual income taxes and 41 percent was payroll taxes. Other taxes, including corporate income and excise taxes, accounted for the remainder.</p>
        <p>Some doctors withheld payroll taxes from their employees and then used the money to buy new homes or to finance their businesses rather than sending it to the government, the auditors said.</p>
        <p>''Our investigation found abusive and potentially criminal activity,'' including willful failure to pay taxes, Mr. Kutz said in testimony prepared for the hearing.</p>
        <p>When an employer withholds taxes from a worker's wages, the employer has a duty to hold the money ''in trust'' for the government, and willful failure to send the money to the government is a felony under federal law, Mr. Kutz said.</p>
        <p>Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, who requested the study, said he did not understand why Medicare continued to pay doctors who owed large amounts in back taxes. Mr. Coleman emphasized that ''we are not casting aspersions on the medical profession'' as a whole, and he said honest health care providers should be angry at ''the 21,000 scofflaws.''</p>
        <p>Leslie V. Norwalk, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said, ''We are very concerned about this issue and are working hard with the Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that we do not overpay providers or other entities who owe the I.R.S. money.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Norwalk said her agency had ''no explicit authority to deny physicians the right to participate in Medicare if they have tax debt.''</p>
        <p>Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the subcommittee, said Medicare officials had for more than five years chosen not to participate in a program that allows the Internal Revenue Service to satisfy tax debts by seizing some of the money paid to federal contractors.</p>
        <p>The investigators compared files from the I.R.S. showing unpaid taxes with files from the Department of Health and Human Services showing Medicare payments to doctors, doctor-owned businesses, laboratories and ambulance operators. The audit did not scrutinize payments to hospitals, nursing homes or suppliers of medical equipment, whose tax compliance will be examined in future investigations, Mr. Kutz said.</p>
        <p>The Government Accountability Office gave these examples of problems:</p>
        <p>Medicare paid more than $100,000 to a doctor in 2005 even though the doctor owed nearly $1 million in federal taxes. The doctor was also delinquent in paying child support and had lost hospital privileges because of ''substandard care.''</p>
        <p>Another doctor was paid nearly $100,000 by Medicare even though the doctor owed more than $600,000 in individual income taxes and had been convicted of laundering money through offshore accounts. The doctor owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support.</p>
        <p>Medicare paid more than $100,000 to a doctor who owed more than $2 million in federal taxes and had an ''extensive history of not filing'' tax returns.</p>
        <p>Medicare paid more than $1 million to a doctor-owned business in 2005, even though the business owed more than $1 million in taxes. The doctor ''owns a million-dollar house, a pleasure boat and several nightclubs while owing taxes.''</p>
        <p>The report did not describe the range of unpaid taxes owed by doctors and other health care providers. Investigators disregarded tax debts of less than $100. The average debt was $62,000. One doctor owed more than $3 million. Another owed ''nearly $3 million.''</p>
        <p>The accountability office said it found tax problems among 5 percent of the Medicare providers it examined. The Defense Department and many civilian agencies allow the Internal Revenue Service to collect overdue taxes by imposing a levy or special assessment on payments to federal contractors.</p>
        <p>In the first nine months of 2005, the report said, ''the federal government lost opportunities to collect between $50 million and $140 million in unpaid federal taxes'' because Medicare did not cooperate with the I.R.S. in making such levies.</p>
        <p>Senator Levin said that ''the vast majority of health care providers are honest,'' but that 21,000 were tax delinquents.</p>
        <p>''While stuffing taxpayer dollars in their pockets,'' he said, ''they are stiffing Uncle Sam by not paying their taxes.''</p>
