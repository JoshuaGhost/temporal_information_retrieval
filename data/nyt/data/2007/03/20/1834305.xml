        <p>Filled with wrangling lawyers, exasperated judges and seemingly intractable landlord-tenant disputes, the housing court in Brooklyn is often an unhappy place. That is particularly true for tenants facing eviction because they cannot pay their rent.</p>
        <p>Franz A. Dextra and Leslie U. McKinnon have helped many desperate tenants avoid homelessness. As court liaisons for the city's Human Resources Administration, they arrange one-time rental assistance for eligible tenants to pay arrears, on the premise that such aid costs less than housing people in shelters.</p>
        <p>Much of their work in housing court -- part of the New York City Civil Court -- involves cultivating relationships with judges, lawyers and landlords. ''Our job is to prevent homelessness,'' Mr. McKinnon said yesterday, before Mr. Dextra chimed in, ''by any means necessary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dextra, 60, and Mr. McKinnon, 54, are among six recipients of this year's Sloan Public Service Awards, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is to present tonight at the Great Hall of the Cooper Union.</p>
        <p>Susan C. Bahn, a Legal Aid Society lawyer who has often fought the city in court, had nothing but praise for the two men. ''They work incredible hours,'' she said. ''They don't say no to our hardest cases. They are always trying to find a way to save families from homelessness and at the same time save the city a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>The awards have been given to city employees since 1973 by the Fund for the City of New York, a private philanthropy established by the Ford Foundation in 1968 to improve the quality of life in New York City. Each winner will receive $7,500. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has helped finance the program since 1985.</p>
        <p>Mary McCormick, president of the fund, said the winners ''stand out for their singular, unwavering focus on innovation, quality and direct service.'' She said they ''elevate even the most routine interaction into an occasion marked by compassion, dignity and respect for those they serve.''</p>
        <p>Members of the public, city employees and past winners submit nominations for the awards. The winners were selected by a panel led by Caroline B. Kennedy, president of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation, and the Rev. Joseph M. Sullivan, a retired auxiliary bishop and a former executive director of Catholic Charities in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The other winners are Kevin J. Bulger, director of the Employee Assistance Program in the city's Office of Labor Relations; Joann B. Gull, deputy executive director and chief nursing officer at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens; Patricia A. Quigley, principal at Public School 61 (also known as Community School 61 and the Francisco Oller School) in the Bronx; and Ralph Simmons, the ombudsman at the Department of Juvenile Justice's Bridges Juvenile Center in the Bronx.</p>
