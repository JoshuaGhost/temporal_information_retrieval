        <p>America's 21st-century wars are inspiring a wave of fact-based filmmaking, and several of the more acclaimed results are washing up on television this week. Sundance Channel presents a double bill on Monday night: Patricia Foulkrod's examination of the American soldier's experience from recruitment to homecoming, ''THE GROUND TRUTH,'' which was shortlisted for best documentary feature at the Oscars (9 p.m.); and Michael Winterbottom's and Mat Whitecross's film about British citizens detained by the United States as terror suspects, ''THE ROAD TO GUANTÁNAMO,'' winner of the Independent Spirit Award for best documentary (10:15). On Tuesday night at 7, Cinemax's Reel Life documentary series presents ''IRAQ IN FRAGMENTS,'' James Longley's impressionistic portrait of daily life in the country. A. O. Scott of The New York Times called the film, an Oscar nominee for best documentary, ''entrancingly, almost disturbingly beautiful.''</p>
        <p>Fallbrook, Calif. -- near Camp Pendleton -- might not be the first place you think of when you think bed-and-breakfast. But what if you could stumble downstairs and have your eggs en cocotte cooked by Tori Spelling? That's the promise of ''TORI &amp; DEAN: INN LOVE,'' a new reality series on Oxygen (10:30 p.m. Tuesday), in which a very pregnant Ms. Spelling, with the help of her husband, Dean McDermott, tries to eke out her $800,000 inheritance by running a B&amp;B in San Diego County. Other stops on the B-list: ''DANCING WITH THE STARS'' begins on ABC (8 p.m. Monday) with built-in plot lines centering on John Ratzenberger, nobly subbing for Vincent Pastore, and Heather Mills, nobly trying a dance competition with a prosthetic leg. And the 2007 MISS USA pageant on NBC (9 p.m. Friday) brings the reign of Tara Conner to an end.</p>
