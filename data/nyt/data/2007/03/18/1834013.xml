        <p>I would direct readers to The Times's Jan. 28 editorial ''New York's Public Schools,'' which observed that the reforms potentially undermine successful schools, deprive principals of necessary support services, and rush into action budgetary reallocations whose consequences have not been fully considered by the administration or aired before the public.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Local Rule,'' by William Ouchi (Op-Ed, March 11), about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's latest proposed reforms of the New York City school system:</p>
        <p>I would direct readers to The Times's Jan. 28 editorial ''New York's Public Schools,'' which observed that the reforms potentially undermine successful schools, deprive principals of necessary support services, and rush into action budgetary reallocations whose consequences have not been fully considered by the administration or aired before the public.</p>
        <p>Although these proposals sound equable and right-minded in the abstract, it is in their application to our particular schools that their flaws become visible, and the chancellor has refused to engage in questions and criticisms about the proposals' application, or to provide parents and school personnel with adequate information to address the proposals' consequences.</p>
        <p>No one I know involved in the public school system knows whether his or her school will gain or lose money this September under these reforms, despite two months of ''public review.'' Several studies of the fiscal dimensions of the proposals have questioned whether they would even benefit underperforming schools.</p>
        <p>Many parents are begging the chancellor's office to delay implementation of the proposals until these concerns have been adequately addressed.</p>
