        <p>Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president and the leader of the Fatah faction, arrived in Gaza on Sunday to meet with Ismail Haniya, the caretaker prime minister from Hamas, in another effort to iron out differences over a possible Palestinian unity government.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen from Fatah and Hamas expressed hopes over the weekend that the new government would be formed this week. But nearly a month after agreeing at Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to create a new government, Hamas and Fatah still disagree on important posts, including interior minister.</p>
        <p>The problem is not just the Interior Ministry portfolio, which controls some of the Palestinian Authority security services, but also the potential inclusion of representatives of other factions that are considered terrorist groups by the United States. Nor is it clear that the factions are agreed on a political document that is supposed to guide the government's work.</p>
        <p>Fatah and Hamas signed the Mecca agreement on Feb. 8, paving the way for a unity government. Under the terms of the agreement, Hamas can nominate an independent candidate for the Interior Ministry, but the appointment has to be approved by Fatah. Two candidates proposed by Hamas have been rejected by Mr. Abbas.</p>
        <p>Mr. Haniya officially resigned as prime minister on Feb. 15 and declared that he would form the new government within three weeks. Palestinian law gives him another two weeks' grace after that.</p>
        <p>The process has already hit delays. Mr. Haniya had asked the factions to submit the names of their ministerial candidates by this past Friday, and he was supposed to have met with Mr. Abbas on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Hamas announced Saturday that it had submitted its names to Mr. Haniya. But Fatah officials have suggested that it will take several days until their party presents its nominees.</p>
        <p>A Fatah spokesman, Ahmad Abdul Rahman, told Palestinian radio that Mr. Abbas would stay in the Gaza Strip for several days.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the unity government is to end internal Palestinian fighting, which has claimed about 100 lives in recent months, and to try to end the international economic boycott that crippled the previous Hamas-led government. Hamas came to power after winning elections in January 2006, but it is defined as a terrorist group by Israel, the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>The countries of the so-called quartet of negotiating partners -- the United States, the European Union, the United Nations and Russia -- have laid down conditions for a resumption of direct aid. In order to qualify, the new government would have to recognize Israel's right to exist, renounce violence and accept previous signed agreements.</p>
        <p>Hamas has so far failed to meet the demands in any explicit way, though Palestinian leaders argue that a unity government would come some way toward doing so.</p>
        <p>A Hamas spokesman, Ismail Radwan, said that in their meeting, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Haniya would discuss the ''broad outlines'' of a political program for the proposed government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radwan told Palestinian radio that Hamas's ministerial candidates ''were chosen from the first, second and third ranks'' of the Hamas leadership and were ''far from the frame of political symbolism,'' suggesting a lower Hamas profile in the new government. Most have not served as ministers before and are not members of the Palestinian parliament, he said.</p>
        <p>A Fatah ''young guard'' leader, Hatem Abdul Qader, said the candidates would also include new faces.</p>
        <p>The post of finance minister has already been promised to Salam Fayyad, a political independent and a former finance minister who has gained the confidence of the West.</p>
        <p>In a new development, the militant Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command has apparently asked to join. The Popular Front is a Marxist splinter group based in Syria and is classified by the State Department as a terrorist organization.</p>
        <p>Like Hamas, it rejected the Oslo accords that gave rise to the Palestinian Authority in the mid-1990s. Unlike Hamas, it has not run for election in the Palestinian territories and has practically no constituency there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radwan said that if its participation were approved, the Popular Front could be assigned one of the portfolios allocated for independents and smaller parties, or one of Hamas's own. ''We are frankly interested in convening all the Palestinian factions in the national unity government,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Small factions like the Popular Front are ''in a struggle for survival,'' said Mahdi Abdul Hadi, director of Passia, a private Palestinian research center in Jerusalem. ''They don't want to be forgotten.''</p>
        <p>Being in government would give them legitimacy, he added, and would empower them for the next round in the post-Mecca reshaping of the Palestinian political system -- namely, the reconstitution of the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>''This is like a business relationship, in which principles are put aside,'' Mr. Abdul Hadi said.</p>
        <p>The small, radical Islamic Jihad faction is an exception, having announced that it would not participate in elections or in any unity government.</p>
