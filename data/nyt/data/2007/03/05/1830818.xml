        <p>Son Volt  ''The Search''  (Transmit Sound/Legacy)</p>
        <p>''I can't stand any more decisions,'' sings Jay Farrar a third of the way through ''The Search,'' Son Volt's sharply bittersweet new album. It's not the only yelp of vexation delivered here by Mr. Farrar, the group's lead singer, chief guitarist and guiding force. But he seems not paralyzed but energized: more driven than he's been in years.</p>
        <p>''The Search'' is largely about distilling sense out of senselessness and culling hope from despair.</p>
        <p>Those are the same American preoccupations that Mr. Farrar memorably tackled with his pioneering alt-country band, Uncle Tupelo. But as songs like ''Automatic Society'' and ''Methamphetamine'' demonstrate, he has contemporary woes in mind. After an opening elegy, ''Slow Hearse,'' the album plunges into a song, ''The Picture,'' with a pointed aphorism: ''War is profit, and profit is war.''</p>
        <p>Simple but effective sonic details -- a chirpy horn arrangement, a reverse-looped guitar part -- prevent ''The Search'' from feeling either preachy or repetitive. And while reality can be bleak in Mr. Farrar's world, there's always a sun-streaked horizon ahead. ''We'll know when we get there,'' he sings confidently, about that unseen place. ''We'll find mercy.''</p>
