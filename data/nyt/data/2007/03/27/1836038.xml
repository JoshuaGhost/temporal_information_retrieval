        <p>CBS said yesterday that it would bring back the former president of its radio division, Dan Mason, to succeed Joel Hollander as head of the 144-station group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason will become president and chief executive on April 16.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason left CBS Radio in 2002. Since then, he has served as a consultant and adviser for a variety of radio clients, including CBS.</p>
        <p>In 1995, he became president of CBS Radio, which merged with Infinity Broadcasting in 1997 and took the Infinity name. Part of his mandate was to integrate the original CBS stations with those owned by Group W, American Radio Systems and others.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hollander, who did not return phone calls seeking comment, is said to have been unhappy with the leadership of CBS's chief executive, Leslie Moonves.</p>
        <p>The station group, like others in the industry, has been struggling, leaving CBS leadership unhappy. Last year, CBS sold 39 of the company's stations for $668 million.</p>
        <p>The industry is under pressure from advertisers who are diversifying their spending into other media, and is losing listeners to a broad array of other media, including the Internet and digital music players.</p>
        <p>CBS Radio's problems have been particularly pronounced. When Howard Stern was preparing to take his talk show to Sirius Satellite Radio, following his former boss, Mel Karmazin, Mr. Hollander argued that the show should be immediately taken off CBS, according to a person knowledgeable about the situation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moonves, however, believed it was better to keep Mr. Stern on CBS Radio as long as CBS retained the rights to the show.</p>
        <p>Eventually that arrangement fell apart, and CBS sued Mr. Stern for promoting his move to Sirius on his morning show on CBS. The two sides settled last spring.</p>
        <p>Despite last year's station sales, Mr. Mason said in a telephone interview that there was no push to sell more stations.</p>
        <p>''To grow our business, it is a combination of two things: executing for our listener and to explore all the new things that high-definition radio will bring,'' he said, using one term for digital broadcast radio.</p>
