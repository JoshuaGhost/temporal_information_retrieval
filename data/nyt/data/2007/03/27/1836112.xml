        <p>Some 800 tribal elders in northwest Bajaur pledged not to give shelter to anyone suspected of terrorist activity. The promise is a bid to bring peace to the tribal region near the Afghan border, where a strike by an American Predator drone in January 2006 came close to killing Al Qaeda's second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, and did kill 18 others. Last October, an airstrike by Pakistani forces on a religious school in the district reportedly killed 83 people. Similar promises made by tribal leaders in North and South Waziristan have been criticized because, in exchange, the government agreed to pull out troops. The Bajaur pledge comes with no such agreement by the government.</p>
