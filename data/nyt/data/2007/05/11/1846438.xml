        <p>BAUMEISTER--Matthew C. 4/5/86--5/11/05. Dearest Matthew, it is now 2 years since we have held you or seen your beautiful smiling face. We suffer your absence with every breath we take there is no escape from the pain of this loss. We had imagined so much happiness for you. For all that you have lost we also grieve. You are loved and remembered every day, every hour, every minute. Sometimes the things we love the most we can no longer touch. Missing you. Mom, Dad and Jared.</p>
