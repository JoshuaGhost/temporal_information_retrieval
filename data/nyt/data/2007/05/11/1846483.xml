        <p>When it comes right down to it, there are precious few DVDs of television series that a modern gentleman or lady absolutely must buy, bind and emboss, and shelve for all time. These include ''My So-Called Life,'' the British ''Office,'' the soon-to-be complete ''Sopranos,'' VH1's ''I Love New York'' and ''Friday Night Lights.'' (That last acquisition should be made this summer, the minute the DVDs of that drama's great first season -- the first of many great seasons, surely -- goes on sale.)</p>
        <p>But even the most selective library would be ruinously incomplete without the boxed set of ''Planet Earth,'' the 11-hour adrenaline rush that wrapped up recently on the Discovery Channel.

        <p>When it comes right down to it, there are precious few DVDs of television series that a modern gentleman or lady absolutely must buy, bind and emboss, and shelve for all time. These include ''My So-Called Life,'' the British ''Office,'' the soon-to-be complete ''Sopranos,'' VH1's ''I Love New York'' and ''Friday Night Lights.'' (That last acquisition should be made this summer, the minute the DVDs of that drama's great first season -- the first of many great seasons, surely -- goes on sale.)</p>
        <p>But even the most selective library would be ruinously incomplete without the boxed set of ''Planet Earth,'' the 11-hour adrenaline rush that wrapped up recently on the Discovery Channel. If you missed the series or the raves it won, know first off that it is as far from nature television's typical lion-gazelle kills as ''The Wire'' is from ''T. J. Hooker.''</p>
        <p>''Planet Earth'' is, instead, an artistic achievement, something we television schmoes in our sectional seats rarely get to witness. It deserves the kind of benedictions that book critics use. It's a tour de force, then. A masterpiece.</p>
        <p>The success of the series has also been certified in TV terms. ''Planet Earth'' is cable's most highly rated natural history program of all time. In college newspapers students report having spent their Sunday nights -- and DVR mornings -- watching ''Planet Earth,'' rapt. One look at the sublime, heroic and often surreal cinematography and you'll see why. Not only would the series inspire an audience in altered states, but it might also induce those states. The scenes of bears, cats, mountains, volcanoes, birds of paradise and the rainforest canopy left this viewer spent, speechless and, before long, ready to watch it again. ''Planet Earth'' has to be seen to be believed. It's a revelation.</p>
        <p>A seemingly more mundane reason to own ''Planet Earth'' is that it represents a technological breakthrough. The founding innovation of the series, which the BBC made over four years with Discovery, is its format. It's shot entirely in high-definition video, a first for a natural history series.</p>
        <p>High-definition video, of course, offers nearly double the resolution of ordinary video, and if you have the right television set and service you can appreciate that hyper-precise image at home. Nature photographers who worked on ''Planet Earth'' have said that the experience made them feel, almost literally, as though scales had fallen from their eyes. Alastair Fothergill, the series's producer, compared upgrading to high-definition to ''having a stocking over your head that you pull off.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps because the series touches on altered states, Mr. Fothergill's statement conjures none other than William Blake, in particular his musing, beloved of druggies, ''If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, infinite.''</p>
        <p>Though much has been written about the practical and impractical aspects of filming in extreme terrain and climates, it's possible that the physical feats that went into making ''Planet Earth'' are not what's gutsiest about it: not the months-long stakeouts of the snow leopard; not the death defiance; not the sleeping with batteries so they won't freeze; not the poisoned eye a producer got from a frog. Enduring physical suffering is stoic, but the real courage of the undertaking is its Romantic and almost hubristic ambitions.</p>
        <p>Isn't there a wonderfully British arrogance -- think Blake, Darwin, Edmund Hillary -- in the cosmic effort to consummate the relationship between man and nature? To cleanse the doors of perception and, thanks to a crew of 70, death-defying aerial shots and magnificent resolution, introduce humankind to its home planet as if for the first time?</p>
        <p>Clearly high-definition television, which betrays secrets like an evil Hollywood friend, was not invented just for red carpets. It does not exist solely to torment starlets with eczema and producers with unusual hairlines. Nor was it created to flaunt the bright, poisonous décor of sports broadcasts. High-definition could not have been created just to irritate us.</p>
        <p>And though we may never realize how good we had it in the lo-fi days of tube-based television -- those fat blurry sets that were generally more humane than today's lean, neurotically clear ones -- high-definition has its virtues. It is made for the few spectacles in this imperfect world that can stand up to its unsparing scrutiny. It also lends an air of high occasion to an experience -- watching television -- that has historically been considered only a step beyond doing nothing.</p>
        <p>What goes well, therefore, with high-def are certain incandescent beauties, from Jonathan Rhys Meyers on ''The Tudors'' to Minka Kelly on ''Friday Night Lights.'' The wonderful intelligence, humor and other-worldliness of gorgeous television environments, on shows like ''Lost,'' ''Entourage'' and (again) ''Friday Night Lights,'' also come through in high-def. But the new technology only meets its match with nature. The team behind ''Planet Earth'' took this seriously and turned the superhuman eye -- the one that sees so lucidly -- on the world. This set of programs is what that grand eye saw.</p>
        <p>The original BBC version with narration by David Attenborough is $79.98, or $99.98 for high definition. The version shown on the Discovery Channel, with narration by Sigourney Weaver, is available at discoverystore.com for $79.95.</p>
