      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Ben Ysursa and Matthew Dunlap, secretaries of state for Idaho and Maine, supports Election Day registration, which allows previously unregistered voters with proper ID to vote in person on election day; holds that this is powerful tool to promote voting, which has been proven by seven states that now use EDR; reject argument that this option might encourage voter fraud because such crime is very rare in EDR states; says that EDR can greatly increase voter participation, especially among 18- to 25-year-olds; maintains that political affiliation is not relevant on this issue and that policy is good for voters and for democracy (M)</p>

        <p>LAST month, Gov. Chet Culver of Iowa signed a bill authorizing Election Day registration, which allows previously unregistered voters with proper ID the opportunity to cast a ballot that day. This is a powerful tool to promote voting and, as secretaries of state of two states that already have this policy in place, we welcome Iowa in joining our ranks.</p>
        <p>With Election Day registration, all qualified voters can participate in the vital American tradition of voting without finding themselves hampered by arbitrary registration deadlines. Seven states -- ours, as well as Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming -- now use E.D.R., and the evidence is convincing: voter turnout in these states is on average 10 to 12 percentage points higher than in other states.</p>

        <p>LAST month, Gov. Chet Culver of Iowa signed a bill authorizing Election Day registration, which allows previously unregistered voters with proper ID the opportunity to cast a ballot that day. This is a powerful tool to promote voting and, as secretaries of state of two states that already have this policy in place, we welcome Iowa in joining our ranks.</p>
        <p>With Election Day registration, all qualified voters can participate in the vital American tradition of voting without finding themselves hampered by arbitrary registration deadlines. Seven states -- ours, as well as Minnesota, Montana, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming -- now use E.D.R., and the evidence is convincing: voter turnout in these states is on average 10 to 12 percentage points higher than in other states.</p>
        <p>While opponents are concerned that this option might encourage voter fraud, such crime is exceedingly rare or nonexistent in states that offer Election Day registration. Citizens of Maine, for instance, have benefited from same-day registration since the early 1970s and no case of voter fraud has ever been attributed to the policy. With simple, fair and safe methods to verify voters, and by relying on effective poll-worker training and sophisticated election administration, our states have ensured the integrity of the process while allowing every eligible citizen to cast a ballot.</p>
        <p>We also reject the oft-used argument that voters not registered in advance should be effectively barred from voting as punishment for not heeding existing deadlines. While it's true even E.D.R. states have deadlines in place for registration by mail, we firmly believe that missing a deadline should not prevent interested and engaged parties from being able to register in person on Election Day. We are committed to leaving no voter behind, including first-time voters, newly naturalized citizens and those who may have recently changed addresses.</p>
        <p>When it comes especially to voters ages 18 to 25 -- a demographic often absent at the polls -- a recent study by Demos projected that in Iowa, Election Day registration could result in a 10.7 percent increase in voting among that group.</p>
        <p>Other beneficiaries are registered voters inadvertently removed from the rolls, newlyweds who just changed their names and people who, because of whatever mix-up, are asked to cast a provisional ballot instead. In same-day registration states, these folks don't leave the voting booth wondering if their ballots will count equally alongside their neighbors'.</p>
        <p>Legislatures from Hawaii to Massachusetts to North Carolina are taking serious steps toward putting Election Day registration into effect. And the need for this critical reform did not escape the notice of Congressional leaders who recently introduced a proposed Count Every Vote act, with an added provision for Election Day registration nationwide.</p>
        <p>Though one of us is a Republican and one is a Democrat, we can attest that political affiliation isn't relevant here: this is a policy that is good for voters, regardless of party, and good for our democracy. When it comes to elections, America is best served when all eligible voters cast their ballots -- even those who missed the registration deadline.</p>
