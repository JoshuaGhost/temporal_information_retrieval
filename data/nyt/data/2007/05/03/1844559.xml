        <p>MY 9-year-old daughter, Clementine, is working in the food service industry these days.</p>
        <p>As soon as school lets out, she ties on an apron and starts flipping burgers. She must be pretty good at it, too, because the other day she earned $50 just for slapping a few pieces of lettuce onto buns.</p>
        <p>''Shouldn't you be wearing a hairnet?'' my husband asked her.</p>
        <p>Clementine barely glanced up from the computer, where she sat clicking away to ''assemble'' fast-food orders -- virtual meat patties, tomato and bun -- as quickly as possible to earn more ''cash.''</p>
        <p>''Dad, pretend I'm not here,'' she said. ''I can't talk right now or I won't make enough to buy a scooter.''</p>
        <p>My daughter lives in two worlds. In one, she is the same small person I have always known, the one who chews on the end of her braid when she reads. But in the other, her imagination runs wild as she plays online at the kids' social network sites where she and many of her friends recently persuaded their parents to open accounts for them.</p>
        <p>When she pretends she's not here, sometimes Clementine is a penguin who waddles around onscreen and visits her friends' igloos at Clubpenguin.com (where a monthly subscription costs $5.95). Other days, she holds down a job or fixes up a house for her onscreen monkey at Webkinz.com (where the cost of membership is $8 to $15, the price of a stuffed animal that comes with a code number to activate an account).</p>
        <p>As online sites aimed at capturing the attention of the pre-MySpace set proliferate, children ages 8 to 12 seem to be effortlessly making the leap from the real world to the virtual, both at these sites and other, free sites like Imbee.com (where parents still must enter a credit card number to activate the free account), Whyville.net (which has advertising) and Nicktropolis.com (where they get a heavy dose of Nickelodeon brands like SpongeBob SquarePants from videos and games).</p>
        <p>It's parents who can't keep up. Even after being reassured by representatives of these sites that they guard my child's privacy and by psychologists that sitting at a screen for hours won't kill her imagination, I wonder what she's doing, whom she's talking to and -- here's the part I find most mysterious -- why it's fun.</p>
        <p>This is a generation gap I may never bridge, having grown up in a time when typewriters roamed the earth and grazed alongside rotary dials. When I was Clementine's age, we had a telephone exchange named ''Terrace'' and my phone number was TE3-2748.</p>
        <p>Am I the only parent lost in the 21st century?</p>
        <p>''No, but it definitely complicates the parenting process,'' Marjorie Taylor, the head of the psychology department at the University of Oregon, said during a phone interview. ''Children fairly quickly are surpassing their own parents' expertise in understanding online worlds.''</p>
        <p>''It reminds me she's going to surpass me in all kinds of other ways, too,'' I said. ''I was hoping to be dead, or at least very old, before that happened.''</p>
        <p>Professor Taylor commiserated. ''These are new territories we're exploring here with this generation of children, with technology moving as quickly as it is,'' she said. ''We tend to think they can't understand the difference between fantasy and the real world, and that's just not true. Here's a way we can see them moving back and forth.''</p>
        <p>Maybe the answer was to explore the territories with her. If I watch her moving back and forth, I'll get my bearings. Won't I?</p>
        <p>''Let me get this straight,'' I said to Clementine the other day as I watched over her shoulder. ''You are hanging out right now with someone named Cleaters, who just invited you to his or her house? Who is this Cleaters person? And don't all those bright colors and beeping things give you a headache?''</p>
        <p>''I don't see anything beeping,'' Clementine said. Taking the concept of multitasking to a new level, she smoothly navigated a pull-down menu to sign up for some shift work in an underground mine; monitored the fluctuations in a chart that tracked the hunger and health levels of her monkey, and clicked on a box that sent a message that said ''Hi'' to this Cleaters person.</p>
        <p>''It's not a Cleaters person, it's Annie,'' she said patiently. ''You know Annie. You're friends with her mom.''</p>
        <p>''I am?'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Sarah,'' Clementine said patiently. ''You were talking to her at school today.''</p>
        <p>''I feel dizzy,'' I said. ''How did that roulette wheel thing suddenly get onscreen and why are you spinning it?''</p>
        <p>''To get a hundred dollars in kidzcash,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''What's that?''</p>
        <p>''Money to buy a backyard for my monkey,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Why?''</p>
        <p>''So we can invite Cosmogrode over to see it and then, if we are lucky, Cosmogrode will invite us over,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''What will we do there?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''See if she has the banana couch.''</p>
        <p>Ah, of course. That makes perfect sense. Not.</p>
        <p>I needed a translator. So I phoned Susan McVeigh, a spokeswoman for Ganz Inc., the Canadian toy manufacturer that launched Webkinz.com two years ago as an accompaniment to its Webkinz line of 41 plush animals.</p>
        <p>''Can you tell me what kids are actually doing on this site?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''No,'' Ms. McVeigh said. ''We are not supposed to be tracking what they do online.''</p>
        <p>''From what I can observe, my daughter appears to be headed for a career in fast food,'' I said. ''Why does she enjoy this?''</p>
        <p>''Kids say it's fun because they get to be a bit more in control than maybe 9-year-olds are in the real world,'' Ms. McVeigh said. ''What we tried to do is appeal to just about every range of interest. Some kids like to work, or look after pets, or decorate. Just like in life, you can follow your fancy.''</p>
        <p>Or, as Karen Mason, the spokeswoman for Club Penguin, put it, ''We offer children the training wheels for the kinds of activities they might pursue as they get older.''</p>
        <p>I went to the kitchen. There, I was happy to find Clementine was now considering a career in veterinary medicine. She had become Dr. Quack's assistant, dispensing bandages, ice packs and medication to various animals.</p>
        <p>''How do you know what treatment to give?'' I asked.</p>
        <p>''By the symptoms,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I don't see any symptoms,'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Shh,'' she said. ''I have to concentrate.''</p>
        <p>''Terrace3-2748,'' I said.</p>
        <p>She asked, ''What's that?''</p>
        <p>At least I know one thing a 9-year-old doesn't.</p>
