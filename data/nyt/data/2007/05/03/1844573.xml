        <p>LIKE any other activity, gardening is more appealing if you have the right equipment. Whether you are watering lawns, hauling dirt or clipping bushes, good tools make it easier on the hands and back. (Just try cutting a thorny bush without gloves.) Organizing and storing the tools is important too, and there are many choices of racks and bins to help keep everything at hand.</p>
        <p>1. The Dual Hose Programmable Timer allows two hoses to be programmed up to seven days in advance to water for any interval of time between one minute and 23 hours. The timer takes a 9-volt battery; $129.95 from Hammacher Schlemmer, (800) 321-1484 or hammacher.com.</p>
        <p>2. The rolling Water Wagon has a three-gallon tank and a wand with a trigger-operated spray, making it possible to water distant corners of the yard without dragging a hose or lugging a watering can. It is $79.95 from Plow &amp; Hearth, (800) 494-7544 or plowandhearth.com.</p>
        <p>3. The Tool Tree will accommodate up to 48 garden tools on a garage wall or in any other storage area; $99.95 from Brookstone, (800) 846-3000 or brookstone.com.</p>
        <p>4. The Large Chicken Coop Cubby stores pots, tools and other garden paraphernalia in individual bins. Made of cedar, the unit is 34 1/2 inches wide by 15 inches deep by 30 inches high; $179 from Smith &amp; Hawken, (800) 940-1170 or smithandhawken.com. It also comes in a smaller size, 27 1/2 inches wide by 11 inches deep by 26 inches high, for $149.</p>
        <p>5. The Garden Rocker's curved bottom permits movement in all directions so you can sit without bending, and an optional seat cushion has pockets to hold tools; $34 (plus $15 for the cushion), at Home Depot, (800) 553-3199 or homedepot.com.</p>
        <p>6. Brookstone's powder-coated metal outdoor sink attaches to a garden hose and comes with its own drain hose. It has a stainless steel faucet and sits in a wood frame with fold-down shelves and a backsplash; $249.95 from (800) 846-3000 or brookstone.com.</p>
        <p>7. The Vigoro Dumping Garden Cart is made of plastic and has a quick-release mechanism; it is $59.99 and is available only at Home Depot stores (for locations, 800-553-3199 or homedepot.com).</p>
        <p>8. Vermont Country Store's machine-washable gloves have small resin plates sewn between the layers of the soft, flexible fabric to prevent thorns and wires from cutting your hands; $34.95 from (802) 362-8460 or vermontcountrystore.com.</p>
