        <p>It is a relatively genteel club, with a membership that has dwindled to four in number: Those who know, firsthand, the pressures and challenges of being the leader of the free world.</p>
        <p>That shared knowledge has traditionally transcended politics to bring together such diverse political figures as President Bush and his predecessor, Bill Clinton; Mr. Clinton and the first President Bush; and Jimmy Carter and the late Gerald Ford.</p>
        <p>But, in a break with this norm, Mr. Carter delivered a blistering critique of President Bush in two interviews released Saturday. And, on Sunday, the White House responded in kind, calling his comments ''sad'' and Mr. Carter himself ''irrelevant.''</p>
        <p>In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation that was broadcast on Saturday, Mr. Carter talked about Tony Blair, the outgoing British prime minister, and his relationship with Mr. Bush, calling it ''loyal, blind, apparently subservient.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview with The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published on Saturday, Mr. Carter said, ''I think as far as the adverse impact on the nation around the world, this administration has been the worst in history.''</p>
        <p>The deputy White House spokesman, Tony Fratto, responded Sunday while speaking with reporters in a middle school gymnasium near Mr. Bush's home here.</p>
        <p>''I think it's sad that President Carter's reckless and personal criticism is out there,'' Mr. Fratto said. ''I think it's unfortunate, and I think he is proving to be increasingly irrelevant with these kinds of comments.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fratto said he could not say whether the president knew about Mr. Carter's comments.</p>
