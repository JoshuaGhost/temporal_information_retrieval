        <p>A report in the Inside Art column in Weekend on May 4 about the entry of Merchandise Mart Properties, a Chicago company, into the art business misstated the name of one of the company's buildings in New York. It is the Architects &amp; Designers Building on East 58th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, not the Design &amp; Decoration Building. (A building called the Decoration &amp; Design Building, on Third Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, is owned by the Cohen Brothers Realty Corporation.)</p>
