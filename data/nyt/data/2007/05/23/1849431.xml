        <p>Opens today in Manhattan.  Directed by Allan King  Not rated; 148 minutes</p>
        <p>In a movie culture filled with fake death and callous killing, ''Dying at Grace'' is not just a shock to the system; it's an accusation. Filmed over 14 weeks in the winter of 2002, in the palliative care ward of the Salvation Army Toronto Grace Health Center, Allan King's wrenching record of five real deaths is a potent reminder of the fearful gap between fiction and reality.</p>
        <p>With almost unbearable intimacy, Mr. King and his director of photography, Peter Walker, film almost entirely in close-up, patiently capturing the fear, confusion and medicated blankness of the terminally ill. One fiercely independent woman worries that her powerful pain medications -- vaguely termed ''breakthroughs'' by the center's unfailingly compassionate staff -- will cause her to die in her sleep, while another is shown coping with the unexpected hope of an agonizingly brief remission.</p>
        <p>Throughout, Mr. King retains the vérité style and inconspicuous approach he pioneered in ''Warrendale'' (his 1967 documentary about emotionally disturbed children); his only narration consists of the nurses' end-of-shift reports and the patients' labored last breaths.</p>
        <p>''Dying is very hard,'' says one of the staff to a distressed relative. ''It's like going through labor.'' And, for this viewer, even more difficult to watch.</p>
