        <p>In the collection of the British Library there are two Gutenberg Bibles, two copies of Magna Carta, five copies of Shakespeare's First Folio and now something new: your e-mail messages.</p>
        <p>Or at least ones like them. Throughout this month the library, in partnership with Microsoft, has been collecting e-mail notes that ordinary Britons and others have sent -- 13,807 so far -- as a way of capturing a sense of life in the 21st century.</p>
        <p>''E-mail is the first major upheaval in written English since the invention of the printing press,'' said Jonnie Robinson, a sociolinguistic and education specialist at the library who has been working on the project, known as Email Britain.</p>
        <p>''And this is the first archive of its kind,'' he added. ''We're looking at it as an electronic time capsule -- for social historians it's going to be an incredibly rich resource.'' (For Microsoft, meanwhile, it serves as promotion for its new Windows Live Hotmail program.)</p>
        <p>As the project's Web site (newhotmail.co.uk/emailbritain) explains, the library wants ''memorable or significant e-mail'' messages that fall into 10 categories: blunders, life-changing e-mails, complaints, spam, love and romance, humor, everyday e-mails, news, world around you and tales from abroad.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the messages detail the indignities of daily life:</p>
        <p>''HAHA the temp in reception got fired after sending this,'' reads one.</p>
        <p>''To: All Users</p>
        <p>Subject: The person who ate my muffin!!!</p>
        <p>It would have been better if U asked for one of my muffins, instead of just taking it without permission.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes little victories are recounted: ''I sent Mum on a mission to Topshop,'' reads one of the submitted pieces, referring to a British clothing store. ''She has already had a glass of Bucks Fizz and has got us both the Kate Moss dresses!''</p>
        <p>As for complaints, this note was sent to a restaurant:</p>
        <p>''I really really really ridiculously enjoy eating chicken and bacon sandwiches. They are, in my mind, the very pinnacle of humanity's pursuit for culinary perfection. Unfortunately however, a Chicken and Bacon and Salad sandwich that I purchased today from your Brighton store, not only was an insult to man's greatest edible achievement, but also taints your own brands impeccable reputation for excellence and customer satisfaction.''</p>
        <p>And here is a description of a life-changing moment:</p>
        <p>''Last night Dave surprised me and took me on the London Eye (I thought I was going to his work do). Anyway to cut a long story short (involving me thinking we were going to Pizza Express  !) he asked me to marry him -- after lots of really girly behaviour of sobbing my heart out I nodded my head!!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson said that the British Library is famous for its collections of ''official history.'' What's great about the collection of e-mail messages, he said, is that ''it's a democratic resource'' that shows how people really lived.</p>
