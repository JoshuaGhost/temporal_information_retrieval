        <p>They know that last season was last season, and this year is this year, but the Mets find it instructive to recall their electric start in 2006 and compare it with how things stand after the first 49 games of 2007.</p>
        <p>Their cleanup hitter has not cleaned up consistently. Their regular second baseman and No. 2 pitcher missed a month with injuries. A starting pitcher went 0-5. Despite that, and more, their 6-4 victory Sunday against the Florida Marlins completed a three-game sweep, improved the Mets' record to 32-17 and put them two games ahead of where they were at this point last season.</p>

        <p>They know that last season was last season, and this year is this year, but the Mets find it instructive to recall their electric start in 2006 and compare it with how things stand after the first 49 games of 2007.</p>
        <p>Their cleanup hitter has not cleaned up consistently. Their regular second baseman and No. 2 pitcher missed a month with injuries. A starting pitcher went 0-5. Despite that, and more, their 6-4 victory Sunday against the Florida Marlins completed a three-game sweep, improved the Mets' record to 32-17 and put them two games ahead of where they were at this point last season.</p>
        <p>Told of the achievement, more than a few players raised their eyebrows, pleasantly surprised.</p>
        <p>''I didn't know that,'' David Wright said.</p>
        <p>Manager Willie Randolph said: ''Just shows how good we are, really. Shows that we're hungry.''</p>
        <p>The Mets' lead over the second-place Braves in the National League East ballooned to four and a half games. Randolph &amp; Company may want to consider sending the Phillies a fruit basket as a token of their appreciation after they completed a sweep of the Braves in Atlanta on Sunday. And so, inevitably, the question must be raised: With all the injuries, slumps and inconsistency that have already accumulated, how is it possible?</p>
        <p>One reason is the Mets' bench is much stronger this season. They can weather injuries to Moises Alou, Shawn Green and José Valentín. Another is their starting pitching, particularly the John Maine of April and Oliver Pérez, which has prevented the bullpen from being overused. That was an issue last season.</p>
        <p>The rotation is gradually looking more formidable. Orlando Hernández is back from shoulder bursitis. And Jorge Sosa allowed two runs and five hits in five and two-thirds innings Sunday to pick up his fourth victory in five starts.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully we can continue this pace,'' said Billy Wagner, who converted his 30th consecutive save opportunity dating to last season, despite allowing a homer in the ninth to his nemesis, Miguel Olivo. Wagner has 12 saves this season.</p>
        <p>A few days ago, the Mets' pace was more of a trot than a gallop. They had lost two of three to the Braves, reinforcing the notion that they could not defeat them unless Pérez was on the mound. But South Florida, and not because of its sultry weather, often proves an elixir for the Mets. They have won all five of their games at Dolphin Stadium this season.</p>
        <p>''It's huge,'' said Wright, who went 2 for 4, drove in a run and scored a run. ''More than anything, it proves to ourselves that we can rebound after a letdown and not let things spiral out of control.''</p>
        <p>With Carlos Gómez (strained left hamstring) and Green (broken right foot) unavailable, the Mets had only two healthy regular outfielders, Carlos Beltrán and Endy Chávez. So after briefly considering inserting Paul Lo Duca, who was given the day off, Randolph started his regular second baseman, Damion Easley, in left field. Easley, who had not taken outfield practice in a month, made his first start in left in 16 major league seasons.</p>
        <p>Before the game, Easley joked that he expected the first ball to be hit to him, but he did not become busy until the sixth. With two on and no outs, Miguel Cabrera ripped a liner to left that Easley made a little leap to snag. The next batter, Josh Willingham, lofted a ball to deep left that Easley grabbed a step in front of the fence.</p>
        <p>''Uneventful,'' Easley said, smiling. ''Just like I was hoping for.''</p>
        <p>Sunday was probably the only time Easley will play there all season. The Mets expect to have a better grasp of their injury situation when Green and Gómez are re-evaluated in New York. They will have additional tests Monday, with a C.T. scan for Green and a magnetic resonance imaging test for Gómez. The Mets will learn the results Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Gómez said his hamstring improved so much overnight that he felt well enough to hit before the game. He said he expected to play Tuesday against San Francisco. Green, walking around the clubhouse with an immobilizing boot, said he could not put weight on the foot, but he remained hopeful that he would not be put on the disabled list for the first time in his career.</p>
        <p>It may not matter, because the Mets appear inclined to swap him on the roster for Ben Johnson, who was summoned from Class AAA New Orleans and who accompanied the team to New York. ''Just going to wait the next couple of days and see what happens,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>The Mets face another decision later in the week. Alou, who stopped by the clubhouse, said he expected to return from a left quadriceps strain that has sidelined him for the last two weeks. Gómez and David Newhan are the candidates to be sent down.</p>
        <p>''Could I play now? Yeah,'' said Alou, who then referred to being on the disabled list. ''But the whole thing about putting me on the D.L. was to get to 100 percent, and I'm not at 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had Lo Duca, Newhan and Julio Franco available on their bench, so they did their best to reduce the possibility of extra innings. They tagged the Florida left-hander Scott Olsen for four runs in the fourth, with Carlos Delgado and Chávez hitting run-scoring singles.</p>
        <p>They added runs in the fifth and eighth on hits by Wright and Franco. By then, the Mets' charter was preparing for the flight home, where a nine-game homestand awaits the team that every day, it seems, does something to surprise itself.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Reliever Guillermo Mota is scheduled to travel to New York on Tuesday before being reinstated Wednesday from his 50-game suspension. The Mets are likely to send Ambiorix Burgos to Class AAA New Orleans.</p>
