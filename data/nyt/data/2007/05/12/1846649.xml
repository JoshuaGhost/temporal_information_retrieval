        <p>LATTIMER--John Kingsley. The faculty and staff of the Department of Urology Columbia University and the J. Bentley Squier Urological Clinic NY Presbyterian Hospital join us in mourning the passing of our chairman from 1955-1980, John Kingsley Lattimer, M.D., M.Sc. A visionary leader, whose passionate commitment to the care of his patients, to the education of future Urologists, to the institutions he served, to his colleagues and the field of Urology set an example that has influenced all who were fortunate enough to come to know him. His advances in Pediatric Urology and the treatment of renal tuberculosis are among his many accomplishments which affected the lives of thousands of children and adults worldwide. We offer our heartfelt condolences to his wife Jamie, his children Evan Lattimer, Jon K. Lattimer, M.D. and Gary Lattimer, M.D. and his entire family. Mitchell C. Benson, M.D. Chairman Carl A. Olsson, M.D. Chairman Emeritus Department of Urology Columbia University J. Bentley Squier Urological Clinic</p>
