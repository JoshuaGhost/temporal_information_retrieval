      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The Kearny Board of Education in New Jersey and the parents of Matthew LaClair, a 17-year-old junior at Kearny High School, settled their dispute on Tuesday night about a teacher who proselytized in class.</p>
        <p>The settlement will include training for teachers and students about the separation of church and state and a public statement by the board praising Matthew for bringing the matter to its attention.</p>
        <p>Matthew recorded his history teacher, David Paszkiewicz, making comments in class in September, including remarks that only Christians had a place in heaven, that the Big Bang and evolution theories were not scientific and that dinosaurs were on Noah's Ark. After the tapes became public, Matthew received a death threat and was shunned and bullied by some of his classmates, he has said.</p>
        <p>In the fall, the board reprimanded the teacher and later adopted a policy barring students from taping in class without a teacher's permission.</p>
        <p>In February, Matthew's parents, Paul and Debra LaClair, filed court papers on their son's behalf saying that they intended to sue the district for violating his First Amendment and civil rights. They faulted the district for not protecting Matthew from harassment by other students and sought public corrections to some of the statements the teacher made in class.</p>
        <p>As part of the settlement, in which neither side admits wrongdoing, the New Jersey regional office of the Anti-Defamation League will start training teachers and students in September about keeping church and state separate in public schools, and about ''the distinction between the scientific theory of evolution and the religious doctrine of creationism.''</p>
        <p>Another part of the deal says the board will make a public statement commending Matthew for his ''courage and integrity,'' and the LaClairs will issue a statement commending the board.</p>
        <p>The settlement does not address the status of Mr. Paszkiewicz, 39, who has remained a history teacher at the high school. Mr. Paszkiewicz, who is also a Baptist youth pastor, had his classes switched in the middle of the school year so as not to have Matthew as a student.</p>
        <p>Demetrios K. Stratis, the lawyer for Mr. Paszkiewicz, said that his client was not involved in the settlement and knew nothing about it. ''There are people who think my client is the victim,'' Mr. Stratis said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Kenneth J. Lindenfelser, the lawyer for the Kearny school board, said the settlement created remedies that go further than any court has gone.</p>
        <p>''This may set the framework for how districts deal with these kinds of situations in the future,'' he said.</p>
        <p>After the settlement passed on Tuesday night -- by a vote of 6-1, with two board members absent -- Matthew said in a phone interview, ''I sincerely hope the board and everybody involved possibly learned something from this whole thing.''</p>
        <p>He said that he had learned plenty, ''like how hard it can be sometimes to go against the grain, and that a lot of times, even though things may be tough, you still have to go through with it and finish it.''</p>
