        <p>Lyubov Denisova, a 35-year-old Russian who has finished in the top 10 in the New York City Marathon four times, has tested positive for an elevated testosterone level.</p>
        <p>Both her A and B samples tested positive, her agent said yesterday. She faces an international ban of up to two years.</p>
        <p>Denisova, who has won the Los Angeles Marathon twice, lives in Gainesville, Fla. Her agent, Andreas Baranov, lives in New York. He said the Russian track federation had informed him that Denisova failed an out-of-competition drug test March 20. Four weeks after failing that test, but before receiving the laboratory report, she finished seventh in the Boston Marathon.</p>
        <p>Baranov said Denisova bought vitamins in January on the Internet. At the same time, he said, she bought Orastan-E, a testosterone drug she did not know was banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency.</p>
        <p>''She read the label,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''She said the label said it helped oxygen capacity and was legal, and she started taking it in February. Her English is not very good, and maybe she misunderstood the label. This is a big surprise for me and for her. We were 100 percent sure she was clean. She took all the blame on herself, and I'm not sure if she will continue running.''</p>
        <p>If she does, it will not be in New York. She has run the New York City Marathon four times, finishing second in 2002, fifth in 2003, third in 2004 (with a career best of 2 hours 25 minutes 18 seconds) and ninth in 2005. She also won the Los Angeles Marathon in 2002 and 2005 and ran second in Boston in 2003.</p>
        <p>''It didn't make sense for us to invite her last year because she had fallen from the top echelon,'' said Mary Wittenberg, the New York race director. ''She ran in our half-marathon March 25 and she and her teammate won it. If she is banned, we won't invite her back. Our athletes are held to a higher standard and they know it.''</p>
        <p>Instead of the New York City Marathon last November, Denisova ran the Honolulu Marathon in December and won in 2:27:19, a course record. The Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported yesterday that Denisova's record would stand and she would be allowed to keep the $67,000 prize and bonus money. The Honolulu Marathon did not have a drug-testing program.</p>
        <p>''I will never invite her to Honolulu,'' said Dr. Jim Barahal, the president of the Honolulu Marathon Association, according to The Star-Bulletin.</p>
        <p>The Russian federation will determine Denisova's penalty. A positive testosterone test usually results in a two-year suspension.</p>
        <p>''She ran 15 years and never tested positive,'' Baranov said. ''I don't know what the ban will be, but running is the biggest part of her life. Maybe she will keep training for the 2012 Olympics in London. She will be 41 then, but I believe she has the power to do it.''</p>
