        <p>DARREN E. HIGGINS wants to help your immune system in a hurry and on the cheap.</p>
        <p>Dr. Higgins is a co-founder of Genocea, a biotechnology start-up company working on a novel method of vaccine development. His goal is to find the quickest way to make inexpensive vaccines that fight numerous complex and aggressive viruses and bacteria.</p>
        <p>In a laboratory in Boston, Dr. Higgins, a 40-year-old associate professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School, oversees graduate students tending samples of proteins drawn from infectious disease cells.</p>
        <p>They are trying to determine which proteins, or combination of proteins, stimulate an immune system response. Once discovered, these proteins could, in theory, be administered to people to prepare their immune systems to resist attacks by the likes of tuberculosis, H.I.V. or malaria.</p>
        <p>The process, Dr. Higgins said, is ''a major breakthrough.''</p>
        <p>''We are mimicking the human body immune response,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His efforts are part of a broad renaissance in vaccine research and development that may hold great promise but also faces considerable challenges. In the case of Genocea, identifying proteins is just a first step. They must still be incorporated into vaccines, which then must be tested for safety and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. After that, they must be manufactured and distributed effectively.</p>
        <p>Those expensive and time-consuming steps have made the vaccine business a high-cost, low-profit one, dominated by giant corporations, with little room for innovation by smaller companies.</p>
        <p>Yet the momentum is shifting. Scientists and entrepreneurs -- and their financial backers -- are taking a new interest in vaccine research and development, aided by a confluence of social, technological and economic changes.</p>
        <p>From a social standpoint, the ravages of infectious disease in poor nations are more visible and have a greater economic impact on wealthier countries than in the past, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
        <p>Not coincidentally, private charities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have pledged more resources for vaccine development. And governments, including the United States, have directed public funds to the fight against potential pandemics and bioterrorism attacks.</p>
        <p>Technological developments in microbiology and genetics have provided new tools for creating vaccines and manufacturing them quickly and economically in huge quantities. Examples of the new generation of vaccines include Gardasil, which helps prevent cervical cancer, and Prevnar, which is used to prevent infections in infants and children.</p>
        <p>Investments are starting to follow. In the first quarter of 2007, venture capitalists invested $192 million in start-ups working on infectious-disease technology (a category that includes but is not limited to vaccine development). At that rate, investors would put $800 million into such start-ups this year, outpacing any of the past six years.</p>
        <p>''I see a renaissance not only in vaccine development, but in the availability of vaccines,'' Dr. Fauci said. Still, he added, change will not come overnight, given the complexity of both the business issues and the scientific ones. He noted, for example, that there was no H.I.V. vaccine yet despite the enormous amounts of money, intellectual and political capital and social good will that have been fighting the disease.</p>
        <p>When it comes to creating vaccines, the devil is in the many details, or the micro-organisms.</p>
        <p>Enter Dr. Higgins, who earned a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan Medical School, then did postdoctoral work at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>At Berkeley, he focused on intracellular pathogens -- infections that can be insidious because they are not easily detected by the immune system. Cells infected by these pathogens can appear normal to the immune system, even though they carry disease inside them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Higgins and his colleagues wondered how they could help the immune system recognize these stealthy diseased cells. Could there be a way to identify the clues that are given by the diseased cells but often missed by the immune system during infection?</p>
        <p>Dr. Higgins determined that they could be identified by using a number of scientific advances. The approach developed by Genocea relies on breakthroughs in microbiology but also in human and disease genome mapping, and on technology that allows more effective delivery of vaccines into the body.</p>
        <p>The traditional method of vaccine development entails the trial and error of modifying infectious disease cells, then injecting them into humans or animals to see if the immune system responds with a near-perfect defense. Such testing can take decades and can include great safety concerns for patients who receive the unproven vaccines.</p>
        <p>Dr. Higgins said that Genocea removed an important area of guesswork by giving vaccine developers the critical disease components -- protein building blocks -- around which to create the prospective drugs. It could save years and, in turn, millions of dollars in research costs, he said.</p>
        <p>In 2006, the market gave him some validation. In two separate rounds of financing, venture capitalists invested about $5 million in Genocea, giving the company seed money for two to three years of development. The company has about 15 full-time employees, and has begun applying its technology to numerous diseases to try to discover their immune-system-provoking proteins. (For competitive reasons, the company declined to say which diseases it is researching.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Higgins's work takes place in two locations. The one in Boston is in a cramped lab at Harvard Medical School, pulsing with activity. The other, at Genocea, has its own state-of-the-art laboratory in a renovated office building across the Charles River in Cambridge.</p>
        <p>Its investors are hopeful, up to a point.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to be able to speed up the F.D.A. approval process, but we are going to speed up the time it takes to discover vaccine candidates that you would ultimately bring to the F.D.A.,'' said Robert Paull, a co-founder of Genocea and managing partner at Lux Capital, the lead investor in the company.</p>
        <p>The process of finding vaccine candidates ''could go from 10 years' worth of development to a couple of months,'' Mr. Paull said. He added that he believed the company could, in the next year, begin licensing some of its technology to vaccine developers.</p>
