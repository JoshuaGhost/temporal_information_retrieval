        <p>The Yankees and the Boston Red Sox extended their rivalry all the way to Asia in November, when the Red Sox beat the Yankees in their bid to sign the star Japanese pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka. Next March, Japanese baseball fans could experience the rivalry up close.</p>
        <p>As reported by The New York Post yesterday, Major League Baseball is in preliminary negotiations with several teams, including the Yankees and the Red Sox, about playing exhibition games in China next March and opening the regular season in Japan, according to several individuals briefed on the negotiations.</p>
        <p>Although other teams are involved, baseball would prefer the Yankees and the Red Sox, who have the league's most contentious rivalry and would conceivably feature four Japanese players, to open the season in Asia. The Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Diego Padres are believed to be two other choices.</p>
        <p>''We are talking to a number of different clubs about a number of different possibilities,'' Patrick Courtney, a spokesman for Major League Baseball, said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Courtney said that the plans were in the preliminary stages and he did not want to comment further.</p>
        <p>Baseball has opened the season outside North America before, most recently in 2004 in Japan when the Yankees played the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. But the possibility of the Yankees and the Red Sox playing regular-season games in Japan is complicated because home games between these teams are so valuable. M.L.B. would have to sufficiently compensate each team for money lost on attendance and concessions. Two regular-season games would probably be scheduled to prevent one team from losing home-field advantage.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are particularly interested in playing in China. Last winter, Randy Levine, the team president, and Brian Cashman, the general manager, went to China on a good-will trip to promote baseball and to try to tap into the Chinese market. The Yankees agreed to help establish baseball academies in China and also send coaches and scouts to develop talent.</p>
        <p>''They would be very interested in playing in Beijing and Japan to start the season,'' the Yankees spokesman Howard Rubenstein said in a telephone interview. ''Because the Yankee brand is so well known in Asia and all over the world, the Yankees would be interested.''</p>
        <p>The Red Sox, through a team spokesman, declined to comment.</p>
