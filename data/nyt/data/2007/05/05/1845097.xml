        <p>He said that it was easier to handle a slump when the team was winning; the Yankees swept three games from Texas earlier this week before losing to the Mariners last night, 15-11.</p>
        <p>''I'm starting to hit the ball a few times the opposite way,'' Abreu said before last night's game. ''I'm close to getting the rhythm. I'm opening up a little too quick.'' Right now, I'm hitting a lot of ground balls to second and popups to first. I'm just rushing. I don't let the ball get deep.''</p>
