        <p>The Sea and Cake  ''Everybody''(Thrill Jockey)</p>
        <p>Voices usually become deeper and wiser as singers get older, but not Sam Prekop's. In the 12 years he has spent making records with the Sea and Cake, and making his own albums in the intervals, his singing has floated up like a balloon. His syllables come out in light puffs of generalized pitch, stylized and consistent and full of will.</p>

        <p>The Sea and Cake  ''Everybody''(Thrill Jockey)</p>
        <p>Voices usually become deeper and wiser as singers get older, but not Sam Prekop's. In the 12 years he has spent making records with the Sea and Cake, and making his own albums in the intervals, his singing has floated up like a balloon. His syllables come out in light puffs of generalized pitch, stylized and consistent and full of will.</p>
        <p>''Everybody,'' the Sea and Cake's seventh album, sounds like some of its others; the band has only very gradually grown fuller through textures and tones. Whether its records pull more toward electronic pop or indie-rock, the band always sounds breezy. This album nearly reaches 1970s AM radio breeziness with its sanded-down, slightly machinelike funk and marmalade guitars.</p>
        <p>The more beautiful the songs on ''Everybody'' -- ''Up on Crutches,'' ''Middlenight'' -- the more they throw you off. It's not quite music for dancing (''Exact to Me,'' with a Nigerian-sounding rhythm, comes close), and though there are some interesting changes it's nowhere near jazz-fusion or progressive rock. What is this music for? What is it about? And who is it for, other than some generalized idea of adults?</p>
        <p>Throwing you off the scent is the Sea and Cake's job, and possibly the key to its longevity. Most of that impetus comes from Mr. Prekop, a powerhouse of indirection, with his easeful sighs, his shrewd and surprising phrasing and his language-poetry lyrics that mean everything and nothing. (What's he so satisfied with? Why doesn't he sound like he's smiling?)</p>
        <p>Before a swelling part of the bridge in ''Up on Crutches,'' where other lyricists might lodge their boiled-down message, Mr. Prekop evenly sings, ''Storm breaks qualify randomly/That's all I see/Directions have got to be clear.'' Study that for a minute. Or don't, because Mr. Prekop seems more interested in words as sounds.</p>
