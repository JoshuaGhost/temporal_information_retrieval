        <p>The United States took a 2-0 lead in the first half on goals by Sheanon Williams and Alex Nimo. But Jamaica rallied to tie the score in the second half with three goals in the final 12 minutes. Jamaica won the match on John Ross Doyley's penalty kick in injury time.</p>
        <p>The United States is the only country to have qualified for all 13 world championships in this age group, dating to 1985.</p>
