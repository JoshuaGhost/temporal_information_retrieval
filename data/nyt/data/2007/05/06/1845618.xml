        <p>It made its mark on sailing's most prestigious regatta, with its rainbow coalition of a crew and its ability to give stronger, richer syndicates plenty of trouble.</p>
        <p>But making the semifinals proved too much to ask of Team Shosholoza, the first team from South Africa -- or Africa, for that matter -- to challenge for the America's Cup.</p>
        <p>Captain Salvatore Sarno's unlikely mulitnational collection still has three races left in the round-robin phase of the challenger series known as the Louis Vuitton Cup. But its loss to Desafio Español on Saturday eliminated its chances of advancing to the final four.</p>
        <p>''What makes it tougher is we were so close, so much in the ballpark,'' said Charles Nankin, Shosholoza's mastman. ''It's bittersweet because we know we have the potential.''</p>
        <p>In truth, they were closer during the races than they were in the standings. With 16 points, the South Africans are in seventh place over all, well behind Desafio Español, which solidified its hold on the fourth and final qualifying spot Saturday by beating Shosholoza and then defeating Mascalzone Latino-Capitalia of Italy in a resail of a match that it had lost the first time before making a successful protest.</p>
        <p>The South African team, started and managed against the odds by Sarno, struck a chord with its pluck and ethos. Viewed at first as a novelty act staffed by amateurs, it evolved into a legitimate professional sailing team. It earned the respect of the top crews with its upbeat attitude and steady improvement in the years of preliminary racing. And it produced a sentimental high by upsetting the heavyweight Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy.</p>
        <p>While other would-be Cup pioneers like China Team failed to establish credibility, Shosholoza pushed top teams, including BMW Oracle Racing, the powerhouse American entry whose luxurious base here sits next to Shosholoza's more modest compound.</p>
        <p>''They're our neighbors across the fence,'' said Rod Daniel, a BMW Oracle crew member. ''You talk about a good, friendly bunch of people; we've had a lot of good racing against those guys. They've certainly given South Africa a boost on the yachting scene.''</p>
        <p>BMW Oracle clinched its spot in the semifinals Saturday with a straightforward, 1-minute-28-second victory against Areva Challenge of France. Luna Rossa also secured its semifinal place and remains tied with BMW Oracle atop the standings with 31 points, although the Americans have four round-robin races remaining to the Italians' three.</p>
        <p>Emirates Team New Zealand, with 30 points, is one victory away from clinching its spot, and the only team with a legitimate, if slim, chance of keeping Desafio Español, with 27 points, from becoming the fourth semifinalist is the Swedish-based Victory Challenge, with 22.</p>
        <p>Five of the 11 challengers have already been eliminated from contention, with Shosholoza and Areva joining that group Saturday and with Mascalzone now on the verge.</p>
        <p>''It's a bit sad, this part of the regatta,'' Daniel said. ''People start to leave.''</p>
        <p>But Sarno, a self-described dreamer, said Saturday that he intended for Shosholoza to return for the next Cup, wherever it is staged.</p>
        <p>''I am a fighter and I want to do another, and I will do another with the same people and with that little bit that we were missing,'' Sarno said. ''We have seen that against the top teams that we are there. But with the experience, they can get the very best from what they have. In each of the top three teams, I think there are probably 150 years of Cup experience, and they can exploit that. And if you make a little mistake, they take 20 or 50 meters from you. But we learned a lot.''</p>
        <p>Sarno, 60, is Italian by birth but since 1988 he has lived in South Africa, where he is the chief executive of Mediterranean Shipping Company South Africa. His interest in the America's Cup began when Azzurra became the first Italian yacht to challenge in 1983 in Newport, R.I.</p>
        <p>Sarno began to seriously consider his own challenge in 2001. At that stage, he had developed a sailing program for underprivileged children in Cape Town and had already recruited several black sailors as crew members of his private yacht.</p>
        <p>''I decided I wanted to present the new South Africa on an international stage, a very important one like the America's Cup, because it is a new country with new ideas, a new government and new hopes,'' Sarno said.</p>
        <p>What he could not manage was attracting South African corporate sponsors. ''I can never forget; I wrote to De Beers, the diamond company, perfect match,'' he said. ''You know what they wrote to me? They wrote that, 'Sailing is an elitist sport, so we prefer to sponsor more normal sports like soccer or things like that.' I mean, can you imagine that a diamond company writes you that something is elitist?''</p>
        <p>But Sarno says he believes he will get more financial support from home now that Shosholoza has made waves here. He told his team Saturday that he intended to launch a two-boat program for the next Cup and that the plan was to start building the first boat in August and have it ready for racing by May 2008.</p>
        <p>Not all of his crew was prepared to sign up right away. Nankin said that the years of climbing the learning curve with limited resources have taken ''a big toll on a lot of the guys in their relationships to their families and the good careers we left behind.</p>
        <p>''But I'm very proud the South African flag has been flown,'' he said. ''If there is any platform for promoting your country, this is it.''</p>
        <p>Sarno said that Shosholoza's overall budget for this one-boat campaign was about $20 million, which is roughly one-tenth of what BMW Oracle spent on its four-year campaign. But Sarno sounded confident that he can do more with a small budget next time, especially if the Cup is staged again in two years.</p>
        <p>''If we do two years with the same budget, believe me, I can win the America's Cup,'' he said.</p>
