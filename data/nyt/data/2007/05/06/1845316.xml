        <p>It's hard to tell without the benefit of seeing Terry Eagleton's body language and facial expressions whether he was pulling Deborah Solomon's leg when he said, ''If I want to read a book, I write one myself'' (April 22). But what does seem clear is that Eagleton was having some posthumous fun with Benjamin Disraeli. According to an early biographer, upon being asked whether he had read a novel by George Eliot, Disraeli famously replied, ''When I want to read a novel, I write one.'' No joke there; Disraeli, when he wasn't busy being Britain's prime minister twice, published no fewer than 16 works of fiction, not to mention one additional book he left unfinished at his death.</p>

        <p>Terry Eagleton asks, ''What would it be like to find our fulfillment through each other rather than against each other?'' He then proceeds to put down Richard Dawkins, Clive James, ''redneck fascists from Texas'' and the ''general culture'' of Americans. I can't help wondering whom else he would have found fulfillment through if the interview ran longer than a page.</p>
