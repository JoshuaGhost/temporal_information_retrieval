        <p>Forty years after it first appeared in the L. L. Bean catalog, the women's French Sailor shirt, knit from fine Peruvian cotton that doesn't fade or fray, is enjoying a fashion renaissance. Stylish shoppers are snatching up the seaworthy topper, which comes in six color varieties. Due to demand, the company has recut the shirt in a Henley style, in addition to the classic crew neck and the popular quarter-zip pullover. This season, kids can be equally chic in pint-size versions of the original. Best of all, the shirt is easy to wear and to afford. The price range for women's shirts is $29.50 to $34.50; the price range for children's sizes is $14.50 to $19.50 (at www.llbean.com).</p>
