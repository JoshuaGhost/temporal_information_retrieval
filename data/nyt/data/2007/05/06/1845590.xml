        <p>A wave of suicide attacks in four provinces of Afghanistan on Saturday killed two police officers and wounded a NATO soldier and two other Afghan policemen, and eight other Afghan police officers were killed in a gun battle with the Taliban, officials said.</p>
        <p>A suicide bomber struck on Saturday morning in Nad Ali District in Helmand Province in the south, killing two policemen, an Interior Ministry statement said. The policemen were guarding a checkpoint, local television reported.</p>
        <p>Half an hour later, the police became suspicious of a man in Samkani District of Paktia Province in the southeast and shot him. The man then blew himself up; he was killed and two policemen were wounded.</p>
        <p>''Another man who accompanied him escaped, and the police are still looking for him,'' said the provincial police chief, Abdul Rahman Sarjang.</p>
        <p>The eight policemen were killed in a gunfight that lasted for hours and broke out after dozens of Taliban fighters opened fire on an Afghan police convoy in the western province of Farah, according to Reuters.</p>
        <p>Also on Saturday morning, a suicide bomber attacked while a NATO convoy was passing in Urgun District in the border province of Paktika, killing himself and wounding a soldier. American forces are operating in Paktika Province.</p>
        <p>''We can confirm the attack and what we know is one ISAF soldier was injured,'' said a NATO spokesman, Maj. John Thomas, referring to the NATO force, the International Security Assistance Force.</p>
        <p>In the western province of Farah, Afghan police officers followed a man driving a car that they suspected was rigged with explosives. The police fired on the car as the driver tried to escape and the car exploded, killing the driver, a statement from the Afghan Interior Ministry said.</p>
        <p>Taliban insurgents meanwhile announced they were extending the ultimatum for a French hostage and his three Afghan colleagues until after the French presidential elections.</p>
        <p>The United States military in a statement from Bagram Air Base said coalition forces killed 10 Taliban commanders during fighting in the Shindand District of Herat on April 27 and 29.</p>
        <p>Afghan officials have said at least 42 civilians were killed in the battles.</p>
