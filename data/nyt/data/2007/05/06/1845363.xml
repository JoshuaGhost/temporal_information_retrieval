        <p>I STUMBLED over the accordion in the basement, its case already as deep in water as I was -- water pouring in from foundation crevices, billowing up through floor tiles into the fringed magenta rug and, more repulsively, backing up from the street through the sewer cap that we had opened in a feeble attempt to drain away the flood. The April northeaster had hit New Jersey, and we were in its path.</p>
        <p>The accordion, which had belonged to my father-in-law, had been there for the eight years since his death. I could almost hear him say to my husband, ''Richie, it's O.K. to get rid of it now.'' But my husband couldn't bring himself to do it, despite the cracked bellows, keys and valves that rendered it beyond reasonable repair. It sat on the floor behind the bar, untouched. Now the muddy, insistent waters lashed at the seams of its old case, worming their way into the blue velvet interior.</p>

        <p>I STUMBLED over the accordion in the basement, its case already as deep in water as I was -- water pouring in from foundation crevices, billowing up through floor tiles into the fringed magenta rug and, more repulsively, backing up from the street through the sewer cap that we had opened in a feeble attempt to drain away the flood. The April northeaster had hit New Jersey, and we were in its path.</p>
        <p>The accordion, which had belonged to my father-in-law, had been there for the eight years since his death. I could almost hear him say to my husband, ''Richie, it's O.K. to get rid of it now.'' But my husband couldn't bring himself to do it, despite the cracked bellows, keys and valves that rendered it beyond reasonable repair. It sat on the floor behind the bar, untouched. Now the muddy, insistent waters lashed at the seams of its old case, worming their way into the blue velvet interior.</p>
        <p>Our basement had been a family room when we moved into our house 20 years ago. Its old-fashioned chestnut-toned paneling, burgundy-and-black tiled floor, and bar were a throwback to the home's first owners. Our daughter, Daria, and her friends used to head downstairs to build Lego Ferris wheels, catch up on cartoons and mold Play-Doh sculptures, the crumbs spilling onto the carpet. As a family we had watched TV there, snacking on pizza and relaxing. Plastic bins of discarded toys and a few soda-stained games with missing pieces lingered as a reminder of those precious years.</p>
        <p>Eventually the basement became my husband's makeshift office and film library. Then, as usable space gave way to piles of memorabilia from his parents, books, records, papers, videos and photos, I stopped going downstairs. The place had moved from cozy to cluttered to chaotic. Now that chaos was in danger.</p>
        <p>I quickly abandoned the accordion and ran, my boots slurping in the murky lake. With a surge of nervous energy, I grabbed at books, files, knickknacks -- whatever came within my grasp on the lowest shelves -- cramming them into the higher crannies that remained. I prayed that old photographs from my in-laws weren't on the bottom of a pile that was totally out of reach.</p>
        <p>My husband gave a mournful groan as a box collapsed and neatly packed mesh containers of films on DVD crashed into the water. I screamed and raced over to retrieve at least some of the tumbling discs. Water reached the tops of my boots; it trickled down my arms as I scooped up two of the remaining containers.</p>
        <p>For years I had tried to spearhead an effort to organize, sort and clean the growing mess. And for years, my husband had procrastinated. ''I'll get started on it during my next vacation.'' That vacation never seemed to arrive. Most of the mess was his, and parting with things came hard, some of it representing good memories of people and places. But then again, some of it was junk -- from broken garden tools to old wallpaper and paint. Only a random sense of order could be seen.</p>
        <p>One thing was certain: more passing time equaled more clutter.</p>
        <p>''How's the basement coming?'' my friends asked regularly, always eager to see how someone else handled the everyday challenges of domestic life. ''Next vacation,'' I would answer. ''Right now, it's 'Basement, the Epic.' '' I continued my jokes, and my husband continued to add more piles, along with reasons to wait for yet another vacation to clean up. Now the flood threatened to carry away the treasures along with the junk. Who could tell which was which anymore? In an attempt to head off any more damage, I frantically dialed for plumbers with 24-hour service.</p>
        <p>''Message box full'' was a recording I heard more than once, as I listened to the storm blasting against the side of our house. Other calls produced actual humans, profusely sympathetic, who told me that no one would be available until at least 7 the following morning.</p>
        <p>After two dozen calls, I found a plumber who arrived just before midnight. Hauling in his rain-drenched equipment through our muddy driveway, the best he could do was snake out our main sewer pipe in case some of the problem was there. The town sewer replied in kind, sending back an ominous river of mud-colored liquid. The floor and foundation kept leaking. The plumber had no water pump or vacuum; they were on another truck at another house.</p>
        <p>The next morning -- we managed only a few restless hours' sleep that night -- a layer of undefined grime streaked the floor in crazy patterns as the water receded back into the offending sewer pipe. Already a musty reminder of last night's events had begun to waft up the stairs, and I shuddered to think of what lay ahead -- the discovery of what might have been ruined, what we didn't even know might have been there.</p>
        <p>I gingerly stepped into the middle of the mess in winter boots lined with plastic bags. An old chair had been damaged; I moved it to the middle of the floor on a rug that was completely ruined, to the accompaniment of a squishing soundtrack. An overnight bag, a box of forgotten school papers, some dropcloths, files of unused recipes, a Scrabble game from my mother-in-law, two ancient vacuum cleaners and assorted parts, an exercise machine, a $10 coffee table from a yard sale -- all joined them. My husband started in with me, and the pile soon grew five feet tall and about as wide.</p>
        <p>Then suddenly it hit me as I stood there covered in grime. I was finally getting my wish. We were cleaning up, and cleaning out, the basement. It wasn't going to be finished in a day, but it had to be done soon before the mold and the smells took hold. I didn't want it to happen this way, but without the storm, it wouldn't have happened at all. Most of the items that were lost were probably destined to go anyway. Like my father-in-law's accordion, they were long overdue. The storm had just been the catalyst.</p>
