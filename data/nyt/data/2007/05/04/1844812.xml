        <p>Ipsco, a leading Canadian supplier of steel pipes to the oil and gas industry, agreed to be acquired by a Swedish steel maker, SSAB Svenskt Stal, for $7.7 billion in cash, the two companies said on Thursday.</p>
        <p>If the transaction is approved by the required two-thirds of Ipsco's shareholders, the purchase will leave two major steel makers in Canada under domestic control: Stelco, which recently emerged from a bankruptcy reorganization, and Algoma Steel, which has been seeking a buyer.</p>
        <p>Speculation about a potential takeover of Ipsco, which is based in Regina, Saskatchewan, but has executive offices in Lisle, Ill., started over a month ago. After a Russian newspaper reported that the company was in talks with the Evraz Group, a Russian steel maker, Ipsco announced that it was in negotiations with another company, which it did not identify.</p>
        <p>It is not clear if that company was SSAB. In an interview, Ipsco's president and chief executive, David S. Sutherland, declined to comment about the negotiations that led to Thursday's announcement.</p>
        <p>But much of Canada's financial community was surprised by the news that the Swedish company, which itself has been viewed as a potential takeover target, was the buyer.</p>
        <p>SSAB sells relatively little steel in North America. But the two companies are prominent in the high-strength plate steel business. That high-margin steel is used to make ships, heavy machinery like bulldozers, bridges and railroad cars.</p>
        <p>With Ipsco, SSAB will become this continent's largest plate steel provider and the second-largest provider of steel pipe to oil and gas companies, after United States Steel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutherland said that Ipsco has recently focused on expanding its energy-related business to include specialized steels for offshore oil rig construction as well as alternative energy sources like wind turbines. Energy companies purchase up to 57 percent of Ipsco's total production by volume.</p>
        <p>''We like energy,'' Mr. Sutherland said.</p>
        <p>Analysts had mixed opinions about the likelihood of another bid coming for Ipsco. While some suggested that might happen, other steel companies have previously said that the company is too costly for their acquisition budgets.</p>
        <p>SSAB said that it had arranged bank financing for the purchase.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 9, 2007, Wednesday  An article in Business Day on Friday about the acquisition of the pipe maker Ipsco by a Swedish steel maker, SSAB Svenskt Stal, referred incorrectly to the status of another steel maker, Algoma. It has agreed to be purchased by Essar Global; it is not seeking a buyer.</p>
