        <p>Bill proposed by Assemblyman Felix Ortiz of Brooklyn would force strippers in New York City and elsewhere to obtain state permit to perform; proposal may be included in package against labor- and sex-trafficking being considered in Albany; strippers comment on why they oppose bill; photo (M)</p>

        <p>It was another Tuesday night at HeadQuarters, a ''gentlemen's cabaret'' on West 38th Street. The women dance topless there, but if a bill proposed this month by Assemblyman Felix Ortiz of Brooklyn becomes law, they will have to obtain a state permit to perform their job, ostensibly to protect them from sex trafficking. According to Mr. Ortiz, the proposal may be included in a package of bills against labor- and sex-trafficking now being considered in Albany.</p>

        <p>A SVELTE brunette in black stilettos and a skimpy, rhinestone-accented outfit gyrated seductively on stage to the beat of reggaeton. In the audience, two women dressed only in black thongs wiggled in men's laps.</p>
        <p>It was another Tuesday night at HeadQuarters, a ''gentlemen's cabaret'' on West 38th Street. The women dance topless there, but if a bill proposed this month by Assemblyman Felix Ortiz of Brooklyn becomes law, they will have to obtain a state permit to perform their job, ostensibly to protect them from sex trafficking. According to Mr. Ortiz, the proposal may be included in a package of bills against labor- and sex-trafficking now being considered in Albany.</p>
        <p>Though she hadn't heard of the permit proposal until that evening, Mia DeFeo, a petite 26-year-old who was working the floor in a sapphire blue gown with a neckline that plunged to her navel, was not impressed. She felt singled out.</p>
        <p>''What about the Rockette girls?'' Ms. DeFeo said. ''Look at them -- they show their crotches. Please.'' Then, with a flip of her long, highlighted hair, she sashayed toward the bar, where a cluster of lanky colleagues in similarly revealing outfits were surrounded by admiring males.</p>
        <p>One of the women, a 21-year-old law student who was wearing a ruby red dress and three-inch silver heels that she called ''short,'' also opposed the bill. ''It would affect my privacy and I wouldn't want it,'' said the woman, who asked to remain anonymous because her parents do not know about her job.</p>
        <p>Besides, she didn't think human trafficking was an issue. ''The women I know are here of their own free will,'' she added. ''Women here are making money and gaining financial freedom they could never get somewhere else.'' Working three days a week, she said, she earns about $8,000 a month.</p>
        <p>Not everyone disliked Mr. Ortiz's bill. One supporter was Vincent Parco, a bald, mustachioed private investigator and star of the former Court TV reality show ''Parco P.I.'' He had stopped by the club to attend a book party for his friend Jeffrey Gurian, co-author of a book of jokes called ''Filthy, Funny and Totally Offensive.''</p>
        <p>''It's a great idea to give them a license -- that way if they get caught scamming guys, they get their license taken away,'' Mr. Parco said as a woman with a pair of tiger eyes tattooed on the small of her back danced for a moment in front of him. ''The only ones who are going to object to this are illegals, those who don't want to pay taxes or if they have criminal backgrounds.''</p>
        <p>The dancing woman, 24-year-old Lydia Nikolevic, paused to offer her opinion.</p>
        <p>''It really wouldn't affect me much,'' Ms. Nikolevic said as she slid onto the banquette. ''To some extent, I think it would help. It's overcrowded.''</p>
