        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Highway Debris, Long an Eyesore, Grows as Hazard'' (front page, May 11):</p>
        <p>Several summers ago, as we returned to New York City from a long weekend at the beach, a boogie board flew off the roof top of the car in front of us. Catching the wind like a sail and snapping the ties that had ''secured'' it, the board came hurtling toward our car, smacked our windshield and by a stroke of good fortune flew over the roof without shattering the glass.</p>
        <p>The speed and impact of this projectile were frightening, and it took all of my control not to veer off the highway.</p>
        <p>Most Americans use their cars to vacation. As summer approaches, securing gear to be used on holiday should be a priority. Simply tying equipment to a car roof should be prohibited and deemed a traffic offense.</p>
        <p>At the very least, bike racks and roof racks with accompanying equipment that can safely secure objects at high-speed travel (ropes, clamps, enclosures) should be a requirement.</p>
