      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Baci Gelato in Albertson opened last September, but many people who live nearby have only recently discovered this sweet spot, tucked away on a commercial stretch of Willis Avenue. A cheerful dessert cafe with orange walls, a blue-tiled floor and a half-dozen tables with chairs in rainbow colors, it seems ready made for summer crowds looking to cool off.</p>
        <p>Two domed gelato freezers display up to 40 flavors at a time, made fresh on the premises. Classics like stracciatella (Italian-style chocolate chip), coffee and pistachio share the bill with lemon, Amarena cherry and mango in a rotating selection of gelato and sorbetto that includes soy, sugar-free and yogurt-based varieties ($2.99 for a small cup or cone, $3.99 for medium, $4.99 for large). The gelato is used to make creamy milkshakes and the sorbetto for fruit smoothies that cost $4.25 ($5.25 for large).</p>

        <p>Baci Gelato in Albertson opened last September, but many people who live nearby have only recently discovered this sweet spot, tucked away on a commercial stretch of Willis Avenue. A cheerful dessert cafe with orange walls, a blue-tiled floor and a half-dozen tables with chairs in rainbow colors, it seems ready made for summer crowds looking to cool off.</p>
        <p>Two domed gelato freezers display up to 40 flavors at a time, made fresh on the premises. Classics like stracciatella (Italian-style chocolate chip), coffee and pistachio share the bill with lemon, Amarena cherry and mango in a rotating selection of gelato and sorbetto that includes soy, sugar-free and yogurt-based varieties ($2.99 for a small cup or cone, $3.99 for medium, $4.99 for large). The gelato is used to make creamy milkshakes and the sorbetto for fruit smoothies that cost $4.25 ($5.25 for large).</p>
        <p>In addition to frozen treats, Baci has a crepe counter with two griddles for made-to-order dessert crepes. Nutella banana ($6) and marshmallow caramel ($6) are big enough to share. Add your favorite gelato to the confection for $2 more.</p>
        <p>A full menu of hot and cold coffees complements the desserts. In addition to espresso ($2), cappuccino ($3.25) and hot chocolate ($2.50), there are nine kinds of flavored frozen coffee drinks (including cinnamon, caramel and double fudge mocha), frosty favorites for those on the go ($4.25 for a medium, $5.25 for large).</p>
        <p>Doron Ben Susan and Allen Aingorn, the owners, have a wholesale business supplying Baci Gelato to restaurants, hotels and gourmet markets by the multigallon tub. At this, their first retail store, you can take it home for $7.50 a pint, $14 a quart.</p>
        <p>Baci Gelato, 1136 Willis Avenue, Albertson; (516) 801-1706.</p>
