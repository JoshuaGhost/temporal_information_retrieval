        <p>''Are you restless like me?'' Tom Gabel of Against Me! sings in ''Up the Cuts,'' a song from his band's next album, ''New Wave,'' due in June. Hey, who isn't? Short attention spans pace 21st-century culture: Web-surfing, sampling, channel-hopping, multitasking. Even live rock music, although it's tied to the limitations of a fixed number of musicians on a stage in real time, jumps all over the place. That explains the improbable triple bill at Roseland that Against Me! shares with Cursive and Mastodon on Thursday. And it's a good part of the charm of Deerhoof, which headlines Irving Plaza that same night.</p>
        <p>DEERHOOF's music juxtaposes the tricky structures of progressive rock -- odd meters, dissonant counterpoint, sudden stops and starts -- with brief stretches of pop, funk or psychedelia. The songs switch from soft to loud, from sweet to fierce, from sparse to overstuffed and back. At one moment, Satomi Matsuzaki (on bass) sings a perky melody; the next, Greg Saunier on drums and John Dieterich on guitar are churning out a sinewy riff; then all three mesh in something danceable. Somehow, the music becomes more than a technical feat; all those ideas arrive with a silly exuberance. 9 p.m., Fillmore New York at Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $16.50 in advance, $17 on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The Roseland bill brings together multiple constituencies. MASTODON is on the progressive end of metal, assembling grand concept albums and songs that slam away for a while, rev up even faster, flaunt twin guitars and might even swerve toward a melody. AGAINST ME! merges the drive and earnest political intentions of punk with touches of Southern rock. The indie-rock of CURSIVE, a band from Omaha, is harder to pin down; its songs embrace bruising post-punk dissonance, swinging trumpet lines and an Anglophile streak that includes both the Kinks and the Cure, all stoked with an impassioned discontent. 6:15 p.m., Roseland Ballroom, 239 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800; $25.</p>
