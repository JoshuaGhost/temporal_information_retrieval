        <p>INTERNATIONAL A3-10</p>
        <p>Taliban Operational Leader Is Killed in Afghanistan  The man who probably was the Taliban's foremost operational commander, Mullah Dadullah, was killed in a joint operation by Afghan, American and NATO forces in Helmand Province, according to an Afghan official and NATO.  A8</p>
        <p>Jordan's King Postpones Visit  A rare visit to the West Bank by King Abdullah II of Jordan was called off at the last minute because of bad weather, Palestinian officials said, and in Gaza, serious fighting between Palestinian factions continued.  A10</p>
        <p>Sunni Offers Plan to Congress  In meetings in Washington with members of Congress, Muhammad al-Daini, a Sunni Arab member of the Iraqi Parliament who says he has survived eight assassination attempts, has offered a pitch that emphasizes the need for American troops to withdraw.  A8</p>
        <p>Pope Assails Economic Tacks  Pope Benedict XVI, in a major speech in Brazil, condemned capitalism and Marxism as ''systems that marginalize God'' and urged the Latin American clergy to feed people's spiritual hunger as the way to ease poverty and halt the Roman Catholic Church's steady decline in the region.  A10</p>
        <p>Pakistan Clashes Press Leader  After political clashes killed 39 in Karachi, analysts said the violence -- and accusations that the government had done little to stop the killings -- had renewed pressure on the president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.  A3</p>
        <p>U.S. Seeks to Keep Data Deal  In an effort to reduce the odds that terrorists will enter the United States, the Bush administration is asking the European Union to lift its objections to the sharing of airline passenger information with American intelligence agencies, the secretary of homeland security said.  A3</p>
        <p>Iran and U.S. Lobby in Mideast  The diplomatic tussle between Iran and the United States intensified as leaders from both countries toured Middle Eastern capitals, seeking to shore up relationships, even as signs of new cooperation over Iraq emerged between them.  A6</p>
        <p>NATIONAL A12-17</p>
        <p>A Weaker Dollar Expected To Aid Growth in Economy  A weaker dollar is helping to make American goods and services more competitive in foreign markets. As a result, the vast disparity between what Americans import and export is expected to narrow, which would allow trade to contribute to economic growth in the United States for the first time in more than a decade.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Chrysler Unit May Be Sold  DaimlerChrysler may be on the verge of selling the struggling Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management, a private investment firm, unwinding a 1998 merger that was meant to create a trans-Atlantic automotive powerhouse, people with direct knowledge of the discussions said.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>For Cerberus Capital Management, the 15-year-old private equity firm, buying DaimlerChrysler is the logical culmination of an automotive strategy that it has pursued for several years. And for two of its top executives, the deal will be a triumphal return to an industry that not so long ago forced them out.</p>
        <p>A17</p>
        <p>Rash of Native Alaskan Suicide  The suicide rate among Native Alaskans was three times that of all Alaska residents and nearly four times higher than the national rate from 2003 to 2006, according to a study conducted for the Alaska Statewide Suicide Prevention Council and other groups. Suicide among Native Alaskans is commonly linked with depression, alcoholism and cultural stress.</p>
        <p>A12</p>
        <p>Land Sale for a Bush Library  The prospect of the George W. Bush Presidential Library's being built on the campus of Southern Methodist University received a lift o when voters in a Dallas suburb passed a proposition that paves the way for the city to sell a piece of parkland to the university.  A12</p>
        <p>Obama Talks of Tax Cuts  If elected president, Senator Barack Obama, the Illinois Democrat, said he would seek to repeal President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and use the money to pay for health care. But he did not suggest he would raise other taxes to pay for expanded services.</p>
        <p>A16</p>
        <p>NEW YORK/REGION B1-6</p>
        <p>Ground Zero Illnesses Cloud Giuliani's Legacy  Most agree that Rudolph W. Giuliani presided over ground zero in the days after 9/11 with decisiveness, determination and self-confidence. But today, with evidence that thousands of people who worked at ground zero have become sick, many regard Mr. Giuliani's triumph of leadership as having come with a human cost.  A1</p>
        <p>Serving in the New York Guard  While there are many loyal members the New York Guard -- a little-known volunteer corps dating to World War I -- critics contend that among the organization's main beneficiaries is a small cadre of politicians who rarely show up for meetings but proudly show off their quasi-military honorifics. A1</p>
        <p>Mayor's Trip Fuels Speculation  Despite multiple denials, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has increasingly fueled speculation that he will run for president by sharpening his national profile and delivering speeches across the country. B1</p>
        <p>BUSINESS DAY C1-10</p>
        <p>U.S. Companies Look Abroad  This year, for the first time, the 500 companies that make up the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's stock index may generate more than half of their sales in foreign countries, as a weaker dollar helps to make American goods and services more competitive in foreign markets.</p>
        <p>A1</p>
        <p>Wall Street Journal's Woes  Despite weekday circulation of more than two million, The Wall Street Journal has lagged behind most major papers in profit margins. High-cost journalism and changes in its ad sales strategy produced a performance that makes its publisher, Dow Jones &amp; Company, attractive to Rupert Murdoch.</p>
        <p>C1</p>
        <p>Clothing Tops Online Sales  For the first time since the birth of online retailing, clothing sales, which hit $18.3 billion last year, have overtaken those of computer hardware and software, suggesting that consumers have reached a new level of comfort on the Web.</p>
