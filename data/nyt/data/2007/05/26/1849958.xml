        <p>It's like a hot beach without a blanket, or a barbecue sadly bereft of sizzling meat. On Friday night, the minor-league Newark Bears gave fans one summertime treat -- a baseball game on a balmy evening -- without another:</p>
        <p>Beer.</p>
        <p>No beer has been sold in the Den, as the Bears' riverfront stadium is affectionately called, this season, which began in early May, and no one is quite sure when it will start flowing again. In the off-season, the team switched food vendors, and the new concessionaire is still waiting for a liquor license, explained Joe Montefusco, a spokesman for the team. The matter is in the hands of city and Essex County officials, he said, adding, ''We don't know when it's coming.''</p>
        <p>Until it does, the Bears, still struggling to fill seats, will have to rely on the understanding of fans navigating a time-honored summer ritual without a time-honored refreshment. The stadium does not allow fans to bring in their own beer.</p>
        <p>So on Friday night, as the temperature in the Bears and Eagles Riverfront Stadium hovered around 85, the Bears battled the Lancaster Barnstormers, a Pennsylvania team, and the fans battled their thirst.</p>
        <p>A few fans, surprised to be in a dry ballpark, found themselves wishing they had smuggled a six-pack past the gates. ''Baseball. Summer. Draft beer: Which of those three things don't belong together?'' asked Andy Pickard, whose son's Little League team got to spend time with some of the Bears players. ''It's Memorial Day weekend,'' he added, with some frustration.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the team said: ''The Newark Bears are delivering fun, affordable family entertainment and creating a stadium atmosphere to match this fan-friendly environment. Whether or not we serve alcohol at the stadium has had no impact on this central mission nor on attendance.'' Mr. Montefusco said that while the team was eager to sell beer again, attendance was not suffering because of the drought. The new vendor's food is better and cheaper, he said, even if there is nothing frothy and alcoholic to wash it down with. The team did not provide exact figures for the share of concession sales accounted for by beer, except to say that it was ''much lower than 25 percent.''</p>
        <p>And attendance, always a problem for the Bears, is up slightly this year, he added. The stadium, with a capacity of 6,200, saw an average crowd of 2,659 at last season's games, compared with 2,764 this season.</p>
        <p>Told of the dry start to the Bears' season, some in the world of minor-league baseball winced.</p>
        <p>''I've never had that happen before,'' said Bill Larsen, the general manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish, a Connecticut team that plays in the same league as the Bears, the independent Atlantic League. ''I wouldn't wish that on anyone.''</p>
        <p>Beer sales at the Bridgeport ballpark make up as much as 25 percent of concession sales, and perhaps more in summer's hottest weeks, he said. ''Hopefully, they're doing well without it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mike Cummings, a spokesman for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees in Pennsylvania, said: ''From a financial standpoint, I'm sure it hurts. We've never been without.''</p>
        <p>On Monday, Roger Clemens may start as pitcher for his team, and the game has sold out -- but that would probably be the case even if the stadium did not sell beer, Mr. Cummings said.</p>
        <p>Before their stadium was constructed, the Brooklyn Cyclones played for a season at St. John's University, where they were not allowed to serve alcohol. Steve Cohen, the team's general manager, said no one complained, but added, ''I would much rather be able to sell beer.''</p>
        <p>In the Bears' nine seasons at the stadium, they have collected a few loyal fans, some of whom said that the benefits of Bears baseball -- $9 tickets and a clean, family-friendly ballpark, easily reached via public transportation -- made the temporary lack of beer more than tolerable.</p>
        <p>David C. Miller said he had adjusted easily to the new reality. ''There's a bar just across the street,'' he said. ''You can leave the park and come back.'' His uncle played for the Bears before World War II, when they were a farm team for the Yankees. This season, they have a record of 12 wins and 7 losses, including a 6-3 victory on Friday night. ''They could use one more pitcher,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>Early in the game, the sun reflected off a nearby office building, bathing the field in a soft orange. Keith Reed, the Bears' leadoff batter, stole second base and made it to third on an error. The stadium's public address system played the song ''Smooth Criminal.'' Rob Derfler, from his seat on the third-base line, raised his hands. He said he was not bothered by the lack of alcohol for sale. ''I don't come here for that,'' he said. ''If they're serving it, fine.''</p>
        <p>Jennifer Shine came with her family, and they carried their own entertainment: a 12-pack of Heineken. After winning a special dispensation from one of the guards -- Ms. Shine's company is a stadium sponsor -- the group made its way to a skybox.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shine, who is to be married on Sunday, was playing host to a group of relatives, including some visiting from out of town, and they could not survive on baseball alone. ''I knew they were going to want something to drink,'' she said.</p>
