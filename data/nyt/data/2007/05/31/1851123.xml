        <p>A proposed ban of alcohol on New York-area commuter trains received an overwhelmingly negative response.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The city banned cigarettes in bars, and the smokers trooped out to the sidewalk. Trans fats in restaurants were next, and the French fry addicts mostly shrugged. But since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that it was considering banning alcohol on commuter trains, it has been a different story.</p>
        <p>Bankers and brokers and blue-collar workers spoke out in defense of the tradition of a Scotch and soda or a cold Budweiser on the ride home to Huntington or Greenwich.</p>
        <p>And the authority listened.</p>
        <p>Faced with an overwhelmingly negative response to the proposed ban, a committee of the authority's board has recommended that the cocktail hour be allowed to continue on the trains and platforms of the Long Island and Metro-North railroads, according to a member of the committee and two people briefed on its findings. The full board is expected to take up the issue next month, and appears likely to follow the recommendation.</p>
        <p>The panel, which has been meeting for the last few months, received a thick sheaf of petitions signed by what officials estimated were thousands of commuters. And it met with representatives of rider groups who wanted to retain the end-of-day ritual.</p>
        <p>''It's one of the things that makes this slog north or east palatable,'' said Richard Shea, a public relations executive who helped start a group called Commuters Allied for Responsible Enjoyment, to defend what he described as ''the romantic ideal'' of the suburban commuter enjoying a drink on the way home -- in his case, a Bud Light on the 6:52 to Chappaqua, in Westchester County. Mr. Shea encouraged fellow passengers to write to authority board members, urging them to block the proposal.</p>
        <p>At Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal yesterday, as riders stocked up on chardonnay and Bass ale for the trip home, many could not resist casting the issue in terms that went far beyond one evening's round of beers.</p>
        <p>''People don't like to have eyes over their shoulders 24/7,'' said John Carnival, 43, an operating engineer from Massapequa Park, on Long Island, who bought two cans of Budweiser, packed in a plastic bag with ice, from a bar cart at Penn Station. He called the proposed ban ''a little too much Big Brother.''</p>
        <p>Liquor service on commuter rail is a vestige of earlier days. Peter Derrick, a transit historian, said the commuter lines were modeled after interstate railroads, on which alcohol was a traditional amenity.</p>
        <p>Uniformed bartenders employed by Metro-North sell beer, wine, hard liquor, sodas and snacks from carts stationed near platforms at Grand Central Terminal on weekdays, beginning shortly after noon. The Long Island Railroad has carts staffed by bartenders on the platforms at Pennsylvania Station, and at the Hunterspoint Avenue, Jamaica and Flatbush Avenue stations, beginning about 3 p.m.</p>
        <p>During the evening rush, bartenders wheel their carts onto two Long Island-bound trains leaving Penn Station and sell alcohol to passengers during the trip. On Friday afternoons in the summer, the Long Island also sells alcohol from carts on the Cannonball, a train that travels from Hunterspoint to Montauk, carrying weekenders to the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>The only full-fledged bar cars that remain are on Metro-North's New Haven line, and are run in cooperation with the State of Connecticut. On a typical weekday, 17 trains leaving Grand Central for cities like Stamford and Bridgeport from 12:07 p.m. to 9:07 p.m. include a bar car.</p>
        <p>The authority first agreed to consider a halt to alcohol sales on commuter trains and in rail stations in December, at the urging of Mitchell H. Pally, a board member from Long Island. Mr. Pally said he was concerned that passengers would drink on the train and then drive home, creating a liability for the authority if they became involved in an accident. He also said he worried that rowdy drinkers might be disturbing other passengers.</p>
        <p>A committee of five board members was created shortly afterward to study the idea.</p>
        <p>But data provided by the authority's Police Department does not indicate widespread problems stemming from the sale of alcohol by the railroads.</p>
        <p>The police issued 287 tickets on the Long Island and Metro-North lines last year to people on trains or in stations who were drinking alcohol and creating a disturbance. Far more prevalent, the police said, were instances of people on commuter lines who needed medical help because of extreme drunkenness. There were 994 such cases on the two railroads last year, but officials said that in virtually every case, the riders appeared to have done most or all of their drinking before they ever got on a train.</p>
        <p>Each year, the railroad bartenders rank high in a customer satisfaction survey of Metro-North riders. In 2006, they received a favorable review from 97 percent of riders, who rated their courtesy and responsiveness second only to that of conductors, who scored 98 percent.</p>
        <p>Gene Colonese, the rail administrator for the Connecticut Transportation Department, said that an official from the department met with the committee in April and strongly urged it not to change the policy, saying alcohol sales were ''a valuable service to our customers.''</p>
        <p>The committee also met with the presidents of the two railroads, conductors and a representative of the authority's police force, which patrols the commuter trains and stations. ''There was no overwhelming evidence of drunkenness or anything like that, or accidents,'' the board member said.</p>
        <p>He said the only person who met with the committee to speak in favor of the ban was Mr. Pally.</p>
        <p>The committee finished its work earlier this month and submitted a report to Peter Kalikow, the authority's chairman, and Elliot G. Sander, the chief executive and executive director. Mr. Kalikow and Mr. Sander declined to be interviewed about the committee's recommendation.</p>
