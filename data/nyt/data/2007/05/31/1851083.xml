        <p>The humor site FunnyOrDie.com, which first appeared in April, is exactly where venerable, broad, obvious, stable venture capital belongs. There is nothing there to frighten viewers or the tech market. Like, for example, a joke you haven't heard.</p>
        <p>Familiar comedians are easy on the nerves. For quick reassurance that this phase of the Web economy is no bubble, you can always turn to FunnyOrDie to catch pleasant Will Ferrell again in that sketch with that toddler. Is it something you might have seen on Carson in 1973? Yes. And pleasant Jimmy Fallon sends up silly teenagers with video blogs. Silly girls don't know anything about war! That will always be true!</p>

        <p>The humor site FunnyOrDie.com, which first appeared in April, is exactly where venerable, broad, obvious, stable venture capital belongs. There is nothing there to frighten viewers or the tech market. Like, for example, a joke you haven't heard.</p>
        <p>Familiar comedians are easy on the nerves. For quick reassurance that this phase of the Web economy is no bubble, you can always turn to FunnyOrDie to catch pleasant Will Ferrell again in that sketch with that toddler. Is it something you might have seen on Carson in 1973? Yes. And pleasant Jimmy Fallon sends up silly teenagers with video blogs. Silly girls don't know anything about war! That will always be true!</p>
        <p>The charming comedy hacks on FunnyOrDie evidently don't see a lot of online videos, can't keep a scene brief and enjoy showing off their singing voices and upper bodies in the name of parody. The site's attitude is -- how to put it? -- accessible. Not funny, exactly. It works best if you need a placeholder in your life for ''I am now watching funny online humor videos.''</p>
        <p>SuperDeluxe.com, which also started this year, recently featured a Christopher Walken impersonator. The performer is someone a person might leave a party early and take an endless subway ride home alone to get away from.</p>
        <p>That subway rider, granted, is a person who sees a lot of humor videos on YouTube, where Christopher Walken impersonators attack all unprotected flanks. But, dare I say it, if SuperDeluxe.com is going to put a Walkenator up, they must at least invite video responses, so the audience members can submit their own impersonations. Because while it's true that almost nobody likes to listen to people do Walken, everybody seems to like to do Walken themselves.</p>
        <p>The online premiere of ''Flight of the Conchords,'' an HBO comedy, has also been posted on SuperDeluxe. It's straight television, something like Ricky Gervais's ''Extras'' for musicians. In the same spirit, the site shows ''Derek and Simon,'' a bona fide sitcom in bite-size episodes, probably because it's the handiwork of Bob Odenkirk, who has Emmys. It looks like second-rate TV, not like YouTube. And it has too many guys in it.</p>
        <p>These two shortcomings are endemic on humor sites: too much fake television and too many guys. When pornography failed to swamp YouTube, as some expected it would, and was instead effectively banished, women seemed to disappear from online humor. Beer-ad jokes prevailed. With Tina Fey and Sarah Silverman running cool comedies on television, why do we have to settle for the also-ran clique online?</p>
        <p>Fortunately, there's CollegeHumor.com, which started in 1999, long before YouTube. It was the creation of two high school buddies who wanted to swap jokes. You can tell.</p>
        <p>No one can accuse this site of not understanding Web video, and nothing here looks like it was developed by a policy group in a bagels-and-brainstorming meeting. (There is tons of swearing, which people with commercial sensibilities typically try to avoid, so as not to frighten advertisers.)</p>
        <p>An obscene rap video about drunken driving -- with surprising rhymes that coincide with mug shots of celebrity D.U.I.'s -- has an unexpected civic sweetness. An equally underproduced speech by a burned-out English Pac-Man who can't be bothered to eat pellets is also winning, and comes in so modestly short you want to watch it a half-dozen times.</p>
        <p>College Humor is also junky-looking, piled high with knickknacks like a teenager's room, and plastered with garish ads. The videos are often funny, but it's also enervating. You stumble on a crass, clanging home movie that's wrapped in an ad for the theatrical feature ''Epic Movie'': a photo of the star Jayma Mays tricked out in cheerleading garb.</p>
        <p>At least it's an image of a woman, I guess.</p>
