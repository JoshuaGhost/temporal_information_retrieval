        <p>Paul Krugman (column, March 5) says that he has been unable to find any economics research papers published after 1991 that attempt to explain the high oil prices of the 1970's. He asks, ''If we don't know why it happened then, how can we be sure it won't happen now?'' But we do know why it happened then: a system of complex price ceilings artificially limited supply and raised the price of oil.</p>

        <p>We no longer have the arcane and complex oil price controls we had in the 1970's. The oil-producing countries still find it in their best interests to maximize total return, which means they will not raise prices to the point where demand is seriously affected. The result is that even with occasional fluctuations in the price of crude, we are still paying less for oil in constant dollars than we did before the 1970's oil embargo.</p>
