        <p>Robert F LaPorta letter warns that new Federal amnesty would be signal to illegal aliens that they can break law and then wait for next amnesty; notes that estimated six million illegals have entered US since 'one-time' amnesty in 1986 (S)</p>

        <p>Re: '' 'Hidden' Workers Nurse Hope of Amnesty'' [Feb. 27]. Such an amnesty would be a major mistake.</p>
        <p>In 1986 Congress granted amnesty to three million illegal aliens. This was to be a one-time amnesty. Since then an estimated six million immigrants have entered this country illegally. Granting amnesty again would send a signal that you can become an American by breaking the law, then waiting for the next amnesty. This is unfair to those who have waited so long to enter this country legally.</p>

Granting amnesty again would send a signal that you can become an American by breaking the law, then waiting for the next amnesty. This is unfair to those who have waited so long to enter this country legally.</p>
        <p>It has been estimated that half the gap in wages between high school dropouts and other workers is due to the immigration of unskilled laborers. While economic conditions may be harsh in other countries, those countries are responsible for their citizens' lot. The United States does not exist to improve the lives of citizens of other countries by hurting the lives of Americans. Permitting illegal immigration is not the answer.</p>
