        <p>THE old Fruit of the Loom plant here is a short walk from the center of town, just past an elementary school, on a winding country road lined with stone walls and tumbling yellow gorse bushes. Employees used to joke about how the factory windows overlooked the white and black crosses of the local cemetery. Now the symbolism is too rich to mention without a bitter grin.</p>
        <p>The plant is one of four Fruit of the Loom sites that closed last year in County Donegal. More than half of the company's roughly 2,000 Irish employees have lost their jobs in the turmoil that has accompanied its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the United States.</p>
        <p>Because of its remote location in the north of Ireland and its proximity to sectarian violence, Donegal has seldom enjoyed prosperous times. But Fruit of the Loom's arrival in 1987 seemed a godsend. ''People saw a light at the end of the tunnel,'' said Bridie Burns, who worked for 12 years at the principal location, in the town of Buncrana. ''There was nothing else there.''</p>
        <p>Now, the locals' role as a tiny cog in the global economy has hit home. ''The rag trade is a risky business,'' said Jim Sheridan, a county councilor in Buncrana. ''People came to terms with the fact that a multinational has a certain life span.''</p>
        <p>Everything started on the right foot, as Fruit of the Loom acquired W. P. McCarter &amp; Company, a textile manufacturer. John McCarter, who with his brother Willy had taken over the company from their uncle, described the combination as ''a very willing and good match'' -- a partnership to jump-start the local economy. By maintaining impeccable labor relations and a commitment to local communities, Fruit of the Loom tied itself to the region. It sponsored soccer teams and St. Patrick's Day parades.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCarter and his brother were ousted from the company six years later in an episode that Ms. Burns compared to ''a death in the family.'' But workers and union officials attribute the company's woes to vague management issues like poor communication and a failure to motivate workers, not on William F. Farley and his executive team.</p>
        <p>''We can't criticize Farley, because he came from America and put this here, and we got 12 good years out of it,'' said Nuala Lynch, a union steward at the plant in Malin Head.</p>
        <p>Only sewing plants have been closed -- leaving behind industrial operations like dyeing and spinning. Nearly all who lost their jobs are women. Now living on generous severance packages, most families have yet to feel the economic impact. But they are anxious about the future.</p>
        <p>When she was laid off in January, Eithne Fullerton, 60, had spent 28 years working for the McCarter Company and Fruit of the Loom, earning a little over $300 a week. Her 27-year-old son, Patrick, who has worked at the Buncrana plant since he was 14, sometimes brings home more than $375 a week, but he is moving out soon to get married. Her husband hasn't worked in 18 years, after two hip replacements.</p>
        <p>With unemployment in Donegal at 22 percent -- compared with a national average of less than 5 percent -- emigration again threatens to depopulate the region. The Irish government, which owns the closed plants, is busily courting new employers and hopes to retrain residents to work in tourism and information technologies.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, some of the laid-off workers, aware that Irish cities are thriving, say Dublin's efforts are too little, too late.</p>
        <p>''We feel that the government have forgotten about this part of the world,'' said Ms. Lynch, 47, now working part time as a substitute clerk in the post office in Malin.  ''They promised us the sun, the moon, and the stars, and we haven't seen any one of them.''</p>
