        <p>Talbot's article will no doubt horrify and reassure secular readers in about equal measure. If the Scheibners are primitives, at least they seem unlikely to make trouble. But the real problem with the fundamentalist counterculture is not that it is backward by liberal standards, but that it is bad theology. Religious conservatives ''cocooning'' with their own simply re-enforce the dominant liberalism of our society and economic system. Retreat into a cozy enclave, after all, is for those who can afford to do so. This hardly seems consistent with a Savior who led a vulnerable existence, often in the company of the poor and outcast.</p>
