        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the conclusion to his review of Eric A. Johnson's ''Nazi Terror'' (Feb. 20), Barry Gewen constructs an erroneous -- and absurd -- hypothetical situation (''What if word had begun seeping back that Japanese-American children were being murdered . . .?'') in his attempt to compare German silence during the mid-1940's, when Jews were being rounded up for murder, to American silence regarding the internment of Japanese-Americans.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In the conclusion to his review of Eric A. Johnson's ''Nazi Terror'' (Feb. 20), Barry Gewen constructs an erroneous -- and absurd -- hypothetical situation (''What if word had begun seeping back that Japanese-American children were being murdered . . .?'') in his attempt to compare German silence during the mid-1940's, when Jews were being rounded up for murder, to American silence regarding the internment of Japanese-Americans.</p>
        <p>It is important to remember that except for a brief period (the Weimar Republic), Germans had lived under authoritarian rule for many decades. Moreover, church-inspired anti-Semitism had been part of the German experience for centuries. It was the unique combination of ultranationalism (the Jew as foreign body) and anti-Semitism (the Jew as Christ-killer) that doomed the Jews, as it did elsewhere whenever this nefarious combination came about.</p>
        <p>For Gewen to create an impossible hypothesis and then presume that the California population would have remained silent defies both logic and the history of democratic tradition.</p>
