        <p>Addressing the nettlesome question of what race people will be considered if they check more than one racial category on their census forms, the Clinton administration declared today that those listing themselves as white and a member of a minority will be counted as a minority.</p>
        <p>The 2000 census will be the first that allows people to check more than one category under race.</p>
        <p>''The first allocation rule is that if you are white and anything else, you are allocated to the minority,'' said Anita Hodgkiss, deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights.</p>
        <p>Guidelines issued today by the Office of Management and Budget are intended to clarify the confusion sown by the administration's decision last October to allow people to identify themselves as members of more than one race.</p>
        <p>The new policy was hailed at the time by groups representing parents of mixed-race children who disliked the old rule that forced them to pick one race for their offspring.</p>
        <p>But civil rights groups expressed concern that the new policy would reduce the number of people who are officially considered black or Asian or American Indian, and would harm minorities when it came to enforcing civil rights and voting rights laws.</p>
        <p>In announcing the new guidelines, Sally Katzen, counsel to the director of the budget office, said the decision to consider those who check the white and minority categories as being minorities reflected a determination that people who have suffered discrimination in the past should be subject to certain protections.</p>
        <p>As a result of last fall's decision, people can now list themselves on census forms that are just now being mailed out as members of any one or more of five racial categories: American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian, African-American, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or white.</p>
        <p>The new policy means that there are 63 racial combinations that the federal government will officially recognize. And, because Hispanic is considered an ethnic group, not a race, the policy also means there are 63 racial classifications for non-Hispanics and 63 ones for Hispanics.</p>
        <p>The guidelines issued today also seek to clarify the responsibilities of businesses or state and local government agencies that are required to provide the federal government with a racial breakdown of their work force, student body or clientele.</p>
        <p>Rather than asking these entities to provide data on all 63 racial permutations, the budget office said it would require a breakdown of a smaller set of categories. Five will be the already-recognized single-race categories: American Indian, Asian, African-American, native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and white.</p>
        <p>Numbers would also have to be supplied on people who listed four racial combinations: American Indian/Alaskan Native and white, Asian and white, African-American and white and American Indian/Alaskan Native and African-American.</p>
        <p>Budget office officials said these four categories were the most commonly selected combinations in tests conducted by the Census Bureau.</p>
        <p>Finally, institutions reporting to the federal government will also have to provide numbers on any other combination of people that make up 1 percent of their work force, student body or clientele.</p>
        <p>Some intellectuals who oppose policies like providing preferences based on race and sex in college admissions see the efforts as a dual-edged sword.</p>
        <p>''I think it's a step forward to stop forcing every American into one racial box, which the Census Bureau has always done,'' said Stephan Thernstrom, a Harvard history professor who is a caustic critic of affirmative action. ''On the other hand, in some ways it's even worse. It's not just one of four or five boxes they're putting you into, it's 63!''</p>
        <p>''And that's not even counting Hispanics,'' Professor Thernstrom continued. ''I just think the absurdity and byzantine complexity of this will become so cumbersome that people will say, 'Let's forget about this stuff.' ''</p>
        <p>But the budget office guidelines were praised as a necessary step, but only an initial one, by civil rights groups that had lobbied the administration to make sure the new racial classifications did not dilute the power and protection of minorities in the enforcement of anti-discrimination and voting rights laws.</p>
        <p>''This is an important first step to make sure that civil rights enforcement is not compromised by the implementation of these racial classification guidelines,'' said Todd Cox, a lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc. ''However, it's just the beginning of the process. We're looking forward to have further conversations on the actual implementation of the guidelines.''</p>
