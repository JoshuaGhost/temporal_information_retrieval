        <p>Janet, My Mother,</p>
        <p>and Me</p>
        <p>A Memoir of Growing Up With Janet Flanner and Natalia Danesi Murray.</p>
        <p>By William Murray.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 318 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Simon &amp; Schuster. $24.</p>
        <p>Janet Flanner has been dead for 22 years. She is no longer remembered at the Hotel Saint-Germain-des-Pres in Paris, where she lived for more than 16 years, and probably many people who today devotedly read The New Yorker, where her column ''Letter From Paris'' appeared for decades, have never read a word she wrote. Yet for a while she was celebrated in reading America, and in the smart lesbian literary Paris of the 20's, ruled by Nancy Cunard, Djuna Barnes and Gertrude Stein, an epoch when the glamorous, literary, newly liberated americaines and anglaises were conspicuous for their witty talk, smart tuxedos and modernist works.</p>
        <p>Flanner's coverage of the French scene ran from 1925 until 1975, and a collection of her pieces, ''Paris Journal,'' won the National Book Award in 1966. They were graceful, trenchant and penetrating; hers was not really a reporter's impulse so much as an observer's, though she did go to Germany after the war and cover the Nuremberg trials. (She left Europe in October 1939, a month after war was declared, and did not return until the end of 1944, when she wore smartly custom-tailored uniforms and was photographed with Hemingway -- a brandy in front of him, two in front of her.) Nonetheless she seems to have regretted that she ''had thrown away her talent through her devotion to churning out the Paris Letter year after year 'as if it were one of the important communications of mankind instead of merely the rather disgraceful means to an end -- my livelihood -- which when handed to me I stuck to in my laziness.' ''</p>
        <p>William Murray's graceful memoir of Flanner's affair with his mother, Natalia Danesi Murray, is a memento mori, a lesson in the ephemeral nature of fame, especially artistic fame, where immortality is reserved for Tolstoy and Picasso, and not for the foot soldiers of newspapers and best-seller shelves, as Flanner noted. The two women had met in 1940, and their affair was to last until Flanner's death in 1978, though Flanner always had several relationships at a time. ''You complain that I have three wives and the truth is, as you know, that I also have a husband, 'The New Yorker,' ''she wrote to the reproachful Natalia. They lived together on and off, but spent much of their time apart, Flanner in Paris, Natalia Murray in New York.</p>
        <p>Strange to say, or perhaps not strange -- Murray could be excused for any ambivalence he may have felt about this prickly and apparently imperious personage -- Flanner comes off as the least pleasant character of his tale. When Murray's father died, she wrote to Natalia that he ''displeases me and disappoints me, dead, as much as he did in the little I knew him in life,'' and she appears to have often felt the same about the son. ''Yes, youth is boring and tiresome, as you say about Bill,'' she wrote tartly to Natalia. ''But he knows an unusual lot for a youth his age and his theme of not doing what he does not want to do, based ever so firmly on what he considers degrading,'' has given ''increasingly firmer proofs of something besides mere restlessness and unreliability.''</p>
        <p>A rather backhanded compliment from someone he kept thinking was a guardian angel; later, she bitterly derided his first novel, behind his back, partly on the grounds that he hadn't worked long enough at it: ''The mystery about Bill is to me how he can talk in conversation with such maturity yet when it comes to writing write in so callow a manner of thinking and vocabulary.'' She vented her ''whole grief and despair at the plight of the American writer and his imagination and problem, without education as a rule, and in his case using an education, as an Italian-American, principally to compare the simplicity he aims for to that of Stendhal -- yes, yes, can it be believed? -- and it . . . filled me with a really despairing grief at the plight of the U.S.A.''</p>
        <p>We all tend to make sense of our lives by the light of some ''narrative,'' to use the fashionable word -- by the light of some suggested pattern that seems to make sense of things once we become aware of it. Someone may have asked William Murray, How was it, being raised by a pair of famous lesbians? To the reader, that may seem the least of it; we find ourselves getting involved with the fate of an attractive, hapless boy towed in the wake of dynamic parents and their worldly friends.</p>
        <p>Murray was born in 1926, and though his mother was Italian, there will be no spaghetti or spumone here. His grandmother Ester was founding editor of a glossy women's magazine in Rome, La Donna; she had lovers and did not cook. His mother also had a distinguished publishing career, at Mondadori, and once was seduced by Gabriele D'Annunzio, the poet. His American father, William Murray, ran the New York branch of William Morris, the talent agency that at the time represented vaudeville stars like Sophie Tucker and Al Jolson.</p>
        <p>Young Billy had a privileged youth of prep schools and Harvard, and served in the military -- but in his determination to stick to the Flanner/Natalia story and with a certain diffident belief that his life is not the object of the reader's inquiry, he tells all this with a reticence that, though becoming, is rather a pity. The reader cannot help getting absorbed in his failed dream of becoming an opera singer, a goal he pursued over the objections of his parents, and in his various setbacks and mistakes. It is clear he was a trying child for these busy and talented but insensitive-sounding adults.</p>
        <p>Murray picks his way among the events of his life and the affairs of his parents with admirable circumspection. What was it like being raised by Flanner and Natalia? Rather like the experience of anyone with a stepparent who comes on the scene when you are 14 and points out all the defects of your previous upbringing. What was it like being raised by lesbians? Rather pleasant, with lots of female attention and parties on Fire Island. ''Envisioning my mother in bed with anyone, male or female, was not something that preoccupied me. I didn't believe that women, unlike men, could be exclusively homosexual. My mother had married my father and given birth to me, hadn't she? All women were susceptible to the male. I imagined no exceptions.''</p>
        <p>Billy, as Flanner acidly noted, makes his way on his own terms, but it is a difficult road. Not really happy at school or university, he leaves Harvard after a year. His father takes him to Hollywood in hopes of manipulating his return to college with promises of a future job. Here we are reminded again of the brevity of fame. Many of the people he mentions need explanation now -- who was Carole Landis? Who was Landis's boyfriend, a name so revered or feared his father would not mention it beyond warning Billy not to flirt with her? Who was Sylvia Sidney's lover, a handsome director Billy meets? Who was Sylvia Sidney?</p>
        <p>He tries reporting, writing, singing. No one in either his Italian or his American family is happy about his desire to be an opera singer, so he passes lonely months in walk-up flats, taking lessons, answering cattle-calls for chorus jobs, and hanging out at the racetrack. He marries -- there is Doris, then, somewhat mysteriously, Alice, then trouble brewing with Alice. What untold stories are abridged here? Children arrive -- Julia, Natalia and Bill Jr. are mentioned. One senses the living beings reading over his shoulder as he writes.</p>
        <p>His mother would publish her and Flanner's letters in the successful book ''Darlinghissima'' in 1985. The boy would become an established writer, a fiction editor at The New Yorker for a time, staff writer there for more than 30 years, and author of such good books as ''The Last Italian.'' Flanner, though censorious about what she considered his early flippancy when it came to the writer's life and craft, something she took with utter solemnity, acknowledged his abilities at last. Her impression of frivolity on his part was based on a misunderstanding. He denies ever approaching writing with anything but dedication, and he tells us he formed his ideas from her own principles. As she had once written to Natalia, all that was really necessary for a writer to succeed -- besides talent -- was ''really working, exhaustingly as is often necessary, over one's writing, to make it good, to make it better and above all to learn what it is one wants to say and how best to say it.''</p>
