        <p>The Caregiver</p>
        <p>A Life with Alzheimer's.</p>
        <p>By Aaron Alterra.</p>
        <p>Steerforth, $21.</p>
        <p>Alzheimer's disease, Aaron Alterra writes, is a ''warren of unexpected nuances that those who have been caregivers try to prepare others for.'' In ''The Caregiver,'' Alterra -- the pseudonym of a novelist who lives on Cape Cod -- offers a guidebook to what he encountered when Alzheimer's disease started shutting down his beloved wife's mind and body five years ago. In that time, he has educated himself about the disease and has investigated both traditional and experimental treatments, both to ease his wife's decline and to satisfy himself that in her years of most need she has not been neglected. He describes the thoroughness of her memory loss with an affecting economy. Sorrow over her sister's death, for example, was lost, as were the mechanics of eating (she now requires a plastic siphon meant for feeding infants). Alterra expresses little anger about an irreversible situation, and is frank about his ethical struggle writing this book: ''Instead of protecting her inadequacies I am exposing them. It violates the privacy of a marriage.'' He is discreet in discussing his wife's condition, and even finds comfort knowing ''that if I were to go into a hospital and not come out, she would not be as affected as I would be to lose her.''</p>
