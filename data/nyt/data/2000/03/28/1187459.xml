        <p>Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York has declined to participate in a review that began in January for the United States Army account. The Army's ad spending is estimated at $110 million annually.</p>
        <p>Philippe Krakowsky, a spokesman for Y.&amp; R., confirmed a report this week in Adweek of the agency's decision against taking part. He declined to comment further.</p>
        <p>Y.&amp; R. Advertising, which has worked for the Army since 1987, was operating under a contract negotiated in 1997 that provided for an initial one-year period plus four one-year renewal options. The Army surprised the agency by deciding against exercising the renewal option and undertaking the review.</p>
        <p>David Beals, a senior partner at Jones-Lundin Associates in Chicago, the search consultant for the Army, said that plans called for the next agency to accept a contract with performance-based compensation. The current contract with Y.&amp; R. Advertising, which expires on July 31, does not have such terms. The new contract could reward the next agency for exceeding recruitment goals; the Army has had difficulties attracting enlistees as the economy improves and young men and women seek jobs in the private sector.</p>
