        <p>Qwest Fails to Reignite Deutsche Telekom Talks  A last-ditch effort by Qwest Communications International to rekindle its negotiations to be acquired by Deutsche Telekom of Germany ended as Qwest failed to persuade U S West, its previous merger partner, to go along with a Deutsche Telekom deal.</p>
        <p>Qwest, which has never publicly acknowledged that it was in talks with the German company, said in a statement that a ''major telecommunications company has withdrawn from discussions to acquire Qwest and U S West.'' Deutsche Telekom saw no realistic way to extricate Qwest from its previous agreement to acquire U S West.</p>

        <p>German Banks Detail Merger Plan  Declaring that the era of ''Germany Inc.'' is over, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, outlined a radical plan to merge his bank with Dresdner Bank in a stock swap worth $30 billion. With $1.2 trillion in assets, the new Deutsche Bank would be second only to the forthcoming union between three of Japan's biggest banks. The planned combination would also unravel the labyrinthine cross-holdings that have for decades bound together German banks and insurance companies.</p>

        <p>Money Laundering Plan Criticized  Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said that he planned to ''toughen up'' legislation proposed by the White House to combat money laundering. He said that the measure left penalties against offshore banks or countries to the discretion of the authorities and that an effective policy required that suspect offshore banks be automatically forbidden access to the United States banking system.</p>
