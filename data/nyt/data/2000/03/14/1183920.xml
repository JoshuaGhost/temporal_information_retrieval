        <p>Christine Andreas  Oak Room at the Algonquin</p>
        <p>When Christine Andreas sings a word like ''thrill,'' the rapid pulse of her rich, rounded soprano races, and she finds a blend of lyricism and sweet sensuality that only the finest Broadway voices can conjure. Ms. Andreas became a star playing Eliza Doolittle in the 20th-anniversary Broadway production of ''My Fair Lady.'' A high point of her newest cabaret act, which plays through April 1, is a medley that includes two songs from that show, ''I Could Have Danced All Night,'' and ''Wouldn't It Be Loverly,'' both executed with a supremely graceful finesse.</p>

        <p>Christine Andreas  Oak Room at the Algonquin</p>
        <p>When Christine Andreas sings a word like ''thrill,'' the rapid pulse of her rich, rounded soprano races, and she finds a blend of lyricism and sweet sensuality that only the finest Broadway voices can conjure. Ms. Andreas became a star playing Eliza Doolittle in the 20th-anniversary Broadway production of ''My Fair Lady.'' A high point of her newest cabaret act, which plays through April 1, is a medley that includes two songs from that show, ''I Could Have Danced All Night,'' and ''Wouldn't It Be Loverly,'' both executed with a supremely graceful finesse.</p>
        <p>Ms. Andreas is so richly endowed with vocal gifts that the beauty of her singing alone can carry a show. And her Oak Room act is generously stocked with classic ballads, including ''Bill,'' ''All the Things You Are,'' ''He Loves Me'' and ''People Will Say We're in Love.'' Joseph Thalken, who accompanies her on piano, supplies competent but mechanical support for a voice that imparts gorgeous semi-operatic flourishes to several numbers.</p>
        <p>As lovely as Ms. Andreas's singing at Saturday's show sounded, the show lacked two ingredients that have made Barbara Cook, the godmother of maturing Broadway ingenues, a cabaret legend. One was rhythm. Working without a bass player and having keyboard support that lent her vocal flights no balancing bottom end, Ms. Andreas's show often seemed musically incomplete.</p>
        <p>What Ms. Andreas needs to reach the next step as a solo performer is a serious and sympathetic collaborator (like Ms. Cook's musical director Wally Harper) who will flesh out the music and help her take the songs into more personal territory.</p>
