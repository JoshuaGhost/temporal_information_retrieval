        <p>The new Sony PlayStation 2 game console, introduced last week in Japan, has already sold more than a million units there and is expected to be equally popular when it reaches the United States this fall, despite a list price of nearly $400.</p>
        <p>Besides its highly advanced 3-D graphics capabilities, its ability to play DVD movies with surround-sound output and its broadband-ready Internet connections, the PlayStation 2 is also backward-compatible with thousands of existing PlayStation game titles. In the past, each new generation of game console was incompatible with the previous one, leading to a scarcity of new game titles and a flood of older consoles at local garage sales. With PlayStation 2, consumers will be able to keep their favorite first-generation PlayStation games while building a collection of new games. Eager game players in the United States are already trying to smuggle the Japanese consoles into the country, even though they cannot play Region 1 (North American) DVD discs without serious unauthorized tinkering with the DVD copy protection system.</p>

        <p>The new Sony PlayStation 2 game console, introduced last week in Japan, has already sold more than a million units there and is expected to be equally popular when it reaches the United States this fall, despite a list price of nearly $400.</p>
        <p>Besides its highly advanced 3-D graphics capabilities, its ability to play DVD movies with surround-sound output and its broadband-ready Internet connections, the PlayStation 2 is also backward-compatible with thousands of existing PlayStation game titles. In the past, each new generation of game console was incompatible with the previous one, leading to a scarcity of new game titles and a flood of older consoles at local garage sales. With PlayStation 2, consumers will be able to keep their favorite first-generation PlayStation games while building a collection of new games. Eager game players in the United States are already trying to smuggle the Japanese consoles into the country, even though they cannot play Region 1 (North American) DVD discs without serious unauthorized tinkering with the DVD copy protection system.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Microsoft Corporation, which used to be the second-largest software company in Redmond, Wash., before overtaking Nintendo, is preparing to announce tomorrow its own game console, whose code name is X-box. Details are scarce, but sources say the X-box will feature an Advanced Micro Devices Athlon processor and an nVidia 3-D graphics card.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's bid to enter the game console market with its X-box, which is not expected to reach the market until the 2001 holiday season, follows the software giant's apparently unsuccessful attempt to establish Windows CE as an alternative operating system for the Sega Dreamcast game console last year. Sega says it has sold more than 1.5 million Dreamcast systems so far, but software developers prefer Sega's own proprietary operating system.</p>
        <p>''The PlayStation 2 is the most powerful product ever introduced to the consumer market,'' said Richard Doherty, director of Envisioneering Group, a technology consulting company in Seaford, N.Y., who described its 3-D graphics capabilities as the equal of a $20,000 Silicon Graphics workstation vintage 1997. He also said the new PlayStation is so popular that thieves are ambushing Japanese teenagers when they emerge from stores carrying the new game machines.</p>
        <p>Nintendo is preparing to introduce its own high-end console, code named Dolphin, later this year. The Dolphin system is expected to include a PowerPC G4 microprocessor and a DVD drive, and like the PlayStation 2 it will also sell for about $350.</p>
