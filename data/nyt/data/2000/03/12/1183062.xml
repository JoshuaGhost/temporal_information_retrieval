      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The great Italian painter Giotto was born in the second half of the 13th century, and little is known of his childhood; even the date of his birth is disputed. The one story the historical record does provide, though, is a vivid one. Lorenzo Ghiberti's ''Commentaries,'' written about a hundred years after Giotto's death, describe a country shepherd more interested in drawing sheep and goats than in caring for them. The young Giotto used sticks to draw outside on rocks and in the dirt; he was discovered doing this by the master painter Cimabue, who was so taken with the boy's work that he immediately asked if he could become his teacher and mentor. The Italian art critic and writer Paolo Guarnieri and his wife, the illustrator Bimba Landmann, have used this anecdote to good effect as the inspiration for their picture book A BOY NAMED GIOTTO, translated by Jonathan Galassi (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $17; ages 5 to 9). Guarnieri's young Giotto struggles with his artistic calling and talent and with his lack of technique. When he spies a beautiful painting being carried in a religious procession he is enthralled. '' 'Who made it? And how?' he asks in amazement.'' When he discovers the picture was created by someone named Cimabue he thinks, ''Certainly a painter would understand me.'' Later, when he meets Cimabue and goes to his workshop to see how pigments and gesso work, the young shepherd observes, ''Neither rain nor wind will ever erase this picture.'' The book's rich, gilded illustrations evoke the Byzantine style that preceded Giotto, while suggesting as well the more subtle colors and the emotional intensity for which he later became famous. In ''The Divine Comedy,'' Dante, a contemporary of Giotto, wrote, ''In painting, Cimabue thought to hold the field / Now Giotto is acclaimed by all / So that he has obscured the former's fame'' -- an achievement also alluded to in this gorgeous, deceptively simple book.</p>
