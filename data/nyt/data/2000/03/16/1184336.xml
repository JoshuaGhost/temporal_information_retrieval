        <p>The South Korea semiconductor giant Hyundai Electronics will buy back some of its shares this year in a bid to prop up the stock price while auctioning off several of its struggling overseas units. Hyundai's president, Park Jong-sup, said the proposed share purchases could be about as large as last year's profit of 200 billion won, or $178.7 million. The company will also sell two semiconductor plants, in Scotland and Wales, Mr. Park said.</p>
