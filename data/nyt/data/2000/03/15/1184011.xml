        <p>It was about noon on a Wednesday, and the retired Silicon Valley executive in a black V-neck sweater was considering a much more relaxed range of choices than he was accustomed to: Should he start with a merlot? Or perhaps a cabernet sauvignon? And should it be a recent vintage or an older, riskier one?</p>
        <p>Eventually, he dived in, nose first, and, after a long sniff, took a generous sip of the 1988 merlot. Pronouncing it acceptable, he moved on to the 1990, 1991 and 1994 versions. Then came the cabernets and finally a single chardonnay to wrap up the tasting.</p>

        <p>It was about noon on a Wednesday, and the retired Silicon Valley executive in a black V-neck sweater was considering a much more relaxed range of choices than he was accustomed to: Should he start with a merlot? Or perhaps a cabernet sauvignon? And should it be a recent vintage or an older, riskier one?</p>
        <p>Eventually, he dived in, nose first, and, after a long sniff, took a generous sip of the 1988 merlot. Pronouncing it acceptable, he moved on to the 1990, 1991 and 1994 versions. Then came the cabernets and finally a single chardonnay to wrap up the tasting.</p>
        <p>After each tilt of a glass, however, came a clue that this was not a typical northern California retiree: the man swished the wine around in his mouth and then spit it into a red plastic cup. It was still before lunch, after all, and the man, Lewis E. Platt, had hours more work in front of him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt, it turns out, is retired only from Silicon Valley, not from the business world. In one of the more unusual corporate job changes in years, Mr. Platt, 58, left Hewlett-Packard last year after 33 years, including an up-and-down seven-year term as chief executive, and promptly took the top job at Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates.</p>
        <p>It was quite a transition. Since December, he has moved from Palo Alto and a global company with 124,000 employees at the center of the new economy, to Wine Country and a private firm with 1,200 workers in one of the world's oldest industries.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Platt accepted the Kendall-Jackson job late last year rather than take the more common path of sitting on corporate boards, teaching business school classes or leading a foundation, he generated a buzz among executives around the country. Gerard R. Roche, the headhunter who selected him, said he had since received calls from at least six ''big-name C.E.O.'s'' asking for help in finding similar posts when they retire.</p>
        <p>One executive said, ''Get me something like that! What a way to go out,'' according to Mr. Roche, the chairman of the search firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt's new job certainly seems romantic. A wine enthusiast with a 2,500-bottle cellar at home, he works in Kendall-Jackson's headquarters here, about 60 miles north of San Francisco, with a first-floor corner office that looks out on a vineyard and the mountains that separate Napa and Sonoma Counties. He has come to the industry in good times, when the long economic expansion has inspired many Americans to drink more expensive wine. Kendall-Jackson has been one of the main beneficiaries, becoming perhaps the biggest California success story of the last decade on the strength of its $10 chardonnay.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Platt's switch has also brought a management problem the textbooks do not discuss: how does an executive who has already climbed his way to the top, and grown used to the trappings that come with one of corporate America's plum jobs, start anew? The question is particularly relevant because both the average age and the average tenure of chief executives at large companies are dropping. As the calls to Mr. Roche indicate, even those chiefs with sterling resumes and lots of energy will be pondering what to do in the coming years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Platt's answer has been to sublimate his ego, forget about the trappings and pretend he is 20 years younger, running a division of Hewlett-Packard. He has thrown himself into the number crunching and small decisions that he once relegated to underlings. ''I'm actually back doing things,'' the burly, mild-mannered Mr. Platt said with satisfaction.</p>
        <p>In his previous life, he made millions, dined with President Clinton and swapped ideas with foreign leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Now, Mr. Platt says, he wants to turn his attention to one of his passions and get the satisfaction that comes from having direct responsibility for products.</p>
        <p>In truth, he had plenty of reasons to take up fishing, one of his hobbies, after leaving Hewlett-Packard. Though the company flourished under him at first, profits slumped in his final years. Some employees and investors blamed his relaxed style, contrasting him with more aggressive corporate leaders who have remade hidebound companies. His successor, Carleton S. Fiorina, has even become the star of Hewlett-Packard's current advertising campaign, saying, ''The original start-up will act like one again.''</p>
        <p>At Kendall-Jackson, Mr. Platt is at a company with a firebrand of its own. Jess Jackson, a San Francisco trial lawyer who founded the winery, and his former wife, Jane, were the only people ever to have run it, and he remains its chairman. ''Jess Jackson took K. J. from a small, second-tier producer and placed it squarely among the top 10 premium producers in California,'' said David I. Freed, the chairman of Silverado Premium Properties, a company in Napa, Calif., that sells grapes to wineries. (Kendall is a family name of Mr. Jackson's former wife, who is no longer in management.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson has the strong entrepreneurial personality and will not have an easy time relinquishing control, say people who have worked with him. Mr. Platt, in other words, went from the undisputed head of a $50 billion company to one of two bosses at a $400 million concern.</p>
        <p>All of which has led some industry analysts to speculate that Mr. Platt is mostly window-dressing to help Kendall-Jackson go public, a move that it has been considering for two years. Even some of his friends think his venture into the wine business is something of a lark, Mr. Platt says.</p>
        <p>''I've had more trouble convincing my friends this is work -- they think I sit around and do tastings all day long,'' he said. Not so, he said: ''This is a real job.''</p>
        <p>One of his first tasks has been to tinker with parts of his management style to fit his new job. Although Hewlett-Packard is a relatively flat organization where all executives work out of cubicles, Mr. Platt still relied on dozens of analysts to comb through information for him. Though he is known for his mild manners, he once stood up in front of a crowd of managers, told them they were falling down on the job, asked them for new ideas and then blasted those new ideas the next day.</p>
        <p>At Kendall-Jackson, by contrast, he has stepped gingerly. He has told his new employees that he does not consider himself a wine industry expert simply because he is a collector. On a tour of Kendall-Jackson's storage rooms and bottling plant, for example, he met some employees for the first time and spoke to them as if he were a tourist visiting the winery, asking them about everything from the speed of a conveyer belt to the level of tannic acid in a wine. During the tasting of merlots and cabernets, he proclaimed his judgment of various vintages, but then turned to Kendall-Jackson's winemaster to see how close to the truth he was.</p>
        <p>Only when Mr. Platt stepped into a laboratory and noticed a Hewlett-Packard chemicals machine did he try to show off some of his own knowledge. ''I actually managed Hewlett-Packard's chemicals business for many years,'' he said, smiling, to the workers in the room.</p>
        <p>He has brought a similar care to his relationship with Mr. Jackson. The two speak frequently, and Mr. Platt says he has been mindful of not grabbing the reins too quickly. ''There are always some issues when the owner or founder is still involved,'' said Mr. Platt, who was Hewlett-Packard's chief when David Packard was still chairman. ''You can't just storm in and take over.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson said, ''Lew has a selflessness about his leadership.''</p>
        <p>He also has the kind of corporate experience that almost every other professional oenophile lacks, and in a few ways he is trying to reshape Kendall-Jackson instead of himself. His laid-back approach, he hopes, will allow him to bring discipline to an enterprise that has sprouted some bureaucracy as it has grown.</p>
        <p>When he arrived in January, Mr. Platt found an approval process for travel and other expenditures that often required five signatures for a single trip. Kendall-Jackson also had little in the way of a formal bonus plan, and employees say they received extra money largely at the whim of their bosses.</p>
        <p>Now, all employees know their bonus depends on some combination of their year-end review, their department's performance and the company's profits. And managers receive a budget and can spend money on travel as they see fit. ''As you start to give people a little more freedom,'' Mr. Platt said, ''you can actually transfer a lot of responsibility.''</p>
        <p>(One byproduct of bureaucracy that Mr. Platt will not eliminate is the door to his office. This is the first time he has ever had one, he said.)</p>
        <p>All the while, Mr. Platt says he has been enjoying taking more direct responsibility for the nuts-and-bolts decisions of running a company. He is studying Kendall-Jackson's vineyards to determine those that can be replanted to produce red wine, which became much more popular in the 1990's as some doctors credited moderate drinking of it with lowering the risk of heart disease. More than 70 percent of Kendall-Jackson's wine is now chardonnay.</p>
        <p>Another priority is to sell more Kendall-Jackson wine overseas. Now, just 3 percent of its output leaves the United States.</p>
        <p>In some ways, his current education resembles his intense introduction to wine in the 1980's. Shortly after moving to California for Hewlett-Packard, he immersed himself in the subject, buying books, attending tastings and pumping for information from his boss at the time, who was Hewlett-Packard's chief operating officer and a wine aficionado.</p>
        <p>It was all a reaction to the first dinner parties he gave in his new state and the wine he served. ''People made fun of me,'' he remembers, ''and I didn't like that.''</p>
