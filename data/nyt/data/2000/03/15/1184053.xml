        <p>Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, said today that there would be no state budget this year until the Pataki administration commits to building the Second Avenue subway the full length of Manhattan, and to a big increase in the state's contribution to the project's cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver's demands raise the first significant obstacle to budget negotiations between the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that would build the subway. Each house of the Legislature has the power to block the M.T.A.'s capital plan, and both have done so this year, demanding a variety of changes.

        <p>Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, said today that there would be no state budget this year until the Pataki administration commits to building the Second Avenue subway the full length of Manhattan, and to a big increase in the state's contribution to the project's cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver's demands raise the first significant obstacle to budget negotiations between the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that would build the subway. Each house of the Legislature has the power to block the M.T.A.'s capital plan, and both have done so this year, demanding a variety of changes. But by linking his demands to the budget, the speaker has raised the stakes considerably.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Silver's statement represents his opening bid in what could be a protracted budget fight, he has made it clear that he considered the authority's capital plan unacceptable because it envisioned only a piece of the Second Avenue line, a project that has been postponed for decades. The last time he made such an ultimatum on the budget, in 1997, he said there would be no budget until Republican lawmakers dropped their plan to eliminate rent controls, and held firm for months until the rent laws were renewed.</p>
        <p>''It is clearly an essential component of this budget, the Second Avenue subway, and it has to come out of this budget,'' Mr. Silver, who is from Manhattan, said in an interview today. ''It is important that we invest in the infrastructure so that 20 years from now, the infrastructure will be there to serve the city. A Second Avenue subway, full build, will be one of the lifelines of a city mass transit system in 2020.''</p>
        <p>All of the players in the process signaled, albeit cautiously, a willingness to negotiate with the speaker. Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's press secretary, said that the Second Avenue subway ''has a lot of merit'' -- perhaps the most positive statement the administration has made about the project -- and that it would be considered ''in the context of the overall budget.''</p>
        <p>Marc V. Shaw, executive director of the M.T.A., said, ''We clearly understand that the Second Avenue subway is the speaker's top priority on the M.T.A. capital plan, and we plan on working with him to accomplish whatever we can.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans who control the State Senate said they could accept the speaker's demands. ''We don't object to that,'' said John McArdle, spokesman for the Senate Republicans, a group whose members hail mostly from suburban and rural areas. ''All we're saying is that there must be parity between mass transit and the capital plan for highways.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called today for a $2.4 billion bond act for highway construction as part of his $77 billion budget proposal -- potentially fertile ground for a trade between him and Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>The M.T.A., which owns the New York City transit system, the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North, has proposed a $17.5 billion capital plan for this year through 2004 to buy new trains and buses, repair existing equipment and start work on new rail routes.</p>
        <p>The plan commits the authority to building a Second Avenue line only on the Upper East Side, with stations from 125th Street to 72nd Street, a piece derided by critics as ''the stubway.'' It would merge with the N and R lines at 63rd Street, providing access to Lower Manhattan, but that would not provide service on the East Side below 72nd Street.</p>
        <p>The capital plan includes $700 million to begin the work -- nearly all of that would be spent in the last two years of the five-year plan -- and it envisions finishing the limited line, at a cost of $3.6 billion, in 2015 or later.</p>
        <p>M.T.A. officials have refused to make a commitment to the full Second Avenue line, and the governor, without explicitly taking a position on the subway, has praised the authority's plan.</p>
        <p>In contrast, the M.T.A. and Mr. Pataki want to move aggressively on a $4.3 billion project to build a tunnel connecting the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal, an effort known as East Side Access. The proposed capital plan would commit $1.5 billion to the planning and construction over the next five years, with a projected completion date of 2009.</p>
        <p>But critics, ranging from legislators to riders' groups to the New York City Partnership, an alliance of major corporations, insist that the two projects must go together. Linking the L.I.R.R. to Grand Central would dump legions of new passengers on the Lexington Avenue subway line, already one of the most crowded. The Second Avenue subway, they say, is needed even without East Side Access because it would relieve some of the pressure on the Lexington line, but the L.I.R.R. project makes it essential.</p>
        <p>''The Second Avenue subway is a part of East Side Access,'' Mr. Silver said. ''They go together.''</p>
        <p>The speaker, a Democrat, attributed the imbalance between the two projects to Mr. Pataki, a Republican, favoring the interests of suburbanites. ''The governor has looked at where his base is, where his Republican votes have come from, and is trying to respond to their needs in that fashion,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If there is a drawn-out fight over the capital plan and the state goes without a budget into the summer, that could create problems for members of the Legislature. It is an election year for all legislators, so they are eager to get home early to campaign, and the state's chronically late budgets are an issue that could be used against them by opponents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver's demands break down into three parts. First, he wants an explicit commitment by the Pataki administration and the M.T.A. to building the Second Avenue line -- which would run through his Lower East Side district -- the full length of Manhattan, a project whose cost has been estimated as high as $12 billion. He is not insisting that it be built by a particular date.</p>
        <p>Such commitments have been made before, most recently in the 1960's, when some of the tunneling was done, only be to reneged on when money got tight. And the project would extend far enough into the future that it would doubtless fall to a new administration in Albany and a new crew at the authority to keep the promise. But making the commitment would carry an undeniable political and psychological weight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver's second demand is that the project be accelerated so that at least a piece of it opens at about the same time as the Long Island Rail Road connection. Again, he did not cite a specific date, and he left his position vague enough that it could be accommodated without a large shift in the overall cost of the five-year plan, by moving money from other projects.</p>
        <p>And third, he argued that at a time when the state has a large budget surplus, it must commit much more money to the capital plan than the $800 million over five years that the governor has proposed, though he did not call for a specific figure.</p>
        <p>''I think the speaker's right on,'' said Robert R. Kiley, president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, an alliance of businesses that has lobbied hard for the subway line. ''The current plan for a Second Avenue subway is neither a wing or a prayer.''</p>
        <p>When told of the speaker's remarks, Gene Russianoff, staff attorney at the Straphangers' Campaign, said, ''My hero.''</p>
        <p>The debate over the subway comes as the state budget process begins to heat up, with the Assembly and the Senate making their budget proposals this week.</p>
