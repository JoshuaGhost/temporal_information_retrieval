        <p>The likely suspension of Scott Niedermayer by the National Hockey League would leave the Devils very thin on defense because of injuries to Vladimir Malakhov and Brian Rafalski and Ken Daneyko's illness. It is uncertain whether they will be able to play when Carolina visits on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>It is all but certain that Niedermayer will be suspended after a hearing Tuesday with Colin Campbell, the league's chief disciplinarian. Niedermayer hit Florida's Peter Worrell on the helmet with his stick in the Devils' 5-2 victory over the Panthers here Sunday night and was assessed a match penalty with intent to injure. ''I deserve something because it was a stupid play,'' Niedermayer said when asked if he expected to be suspended. ''It's obvious that I hit him and I can't take it back. But I don't think I hit him hard enough to hurt him.''</p>

        <p>It is all but certain that Niedermayer will be suspended after a hearing Tuesday with Colin Campbell, the league's chief disciplinarian. Niedermayer hit Florida's Peter Worrell on the helmet with his stick in the Devils' 5-2 victory over the Panthers here Sunday night and was assessed a match penalty with intent to injure. ''I deserve something because it was a stupid play,'' Niedermayer said when asked if he expected to be suspended. ''It's obvious that I hit him and I can't take it back. But I don't think I hit him hard enough to hurt him.''</p>
        <p>Niedermayer might get a light sentence from Campbell because he is a first-time offender. Worrell made repeated slashing motions across his throat as he left the ice after the incident, which came with 1:45 left in the game.</p>
        <p>''I guess he'd get fined in the N.F.L.,'' Niedermayer said of Worrell's slashing motions, ''but not in the N.H.L. We like that stuff.''</p>
