        <p>As many as 1,900 Queens residents were unknowingly infected with the West Nile virus last fall, New York City health officials have concluded in the aftermath of the outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus that killed 7 people and sickened at least 62 in the New York area.</p>
        <p>Extrapolating from a survey in October across a three-square-mile swath of northern Queens, the epicenter of last year's outbreak, officials concluded that 533 to 1,903 people, or about 2.6 percent of the area's 46,000 residents, had been infected with the virus, according to survey results released yesterday. The officials said they did not consider the results surprising. But only a fraction of those infected with the virus -- nine cases, three of them fatal, were confirmed in the northern Queens hot spot -- contracted encephalitis, which often mimics the flu, but infrequently leads to deadly brain swelling.</p>

        <p>As many as 1,900 Queens residents were unknowingly infected with the West Nile virus last fall, New York City health officials have concluded in the aftermath of the outbreak of the mosquito-borne virus that killed 7 people and sickened at least 62 in the New York area.</p>
        <p>Extrapolating from a survey in October across a three-square-mile swath of northern Queens, the epicenter of last year's outbreak, officials concluded that 533 to 1,903 people, or about 2.6 percent of the area's 46,000 residents, had been infected with the virus, according to survey results released yesterday. The officials said they did not consider the results surprising. But only a fraction of those infected with the virus -- nine cases, three of them fatal, were confirmed in the northern Queens hot spot -- contracted encephalitis, which often mimics the flu, but infrequently leads to deadly brain swelling.</p>
        <p>Illness caused by the West Nile virus is typically short-lived and can lead to lifelong immunity, Health Department officials said, although they were unable to say definitively that exposure guarantees lifelong immunity. There is no vaccine to protect against the disease.</p>
        <p>Health Department officials said yesterday that the survey did not examine the rate of infection for the other boroughs because the virus was most prevalent among birds and mosquitoes in the northern Queens epicenter, where the outbreak was first detected last August.</p>
        <p>Officials said the average percentage of the population found to be infected, through anonymous blood sampling, was similar to the rate of infection among residents of Bucharest, Romania, where there was an outbreak of West Nile encephalitis in 1996.</p>
        <p>The survey involved 677 people who gave blood last fall at mobile health vans parked in the northern Queens neighborhoods of Whitestone, Auburndale, Linden Hill and Murray Hill. Nineteen of them tested positive for antibodies to the West Nile virus. That led officials to estimate that 1.2 percent to 4.1 percent of the population in that three-square-mile section had been infected.</p>
        <p>John Gadd, a spokesman for the Health Department, said none of the 19 people who tested positive for the virus had become seriously ill, reporting either no symptoms or mild illness, like a low-grade fever.</p>
        <p>West Nile virus is endemic in Africa, the Middle East and western Asia and has periodically emerged in Europe, but the outbreak in New York City and its suburbs last summer was the first time it had struck the Western Hemisphere. The results of the survey were announced as the city and other towns and counties in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are bracing for this year's mosquito season, which begins next month.</p>
        <p>The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned earlier this month that the disease would probably recur this year. Health officials in many municipalities are planning programs to kill mosquito larvae before they hatch, in an attempt to avoid a repetition of the aerial insecticide spraying used to control adult mosquito populations last year.</p>
