        <p>THE modem industry had one of those handwriting-on-the-wall moments last week as the market leader, the 3Com Corporation, announced that it was getting out. The company said it wanted to concentrate on higher-growth markets like broadband communications and Internet telephony, implying that plain old modems, which let computers send and receive data over wires, had become a boring commodity.</p>
        <p>And yet worldwide modem sales nearly doubled in 1999, to 120 million units. That's not high growth?</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of paradoxes in the modem market right now,'' said Ernie Rapiere, an analyst with VisionQuest 2000, a market research firm based in Moorpark, Calif. Mr. Rapiere noted that sales of modem chip sets, the active ingredients of outboard modems and of modem cards, games and set-top boxes with built-in communications capabilities, grew ''as much in 1999 as in any year in the past 10.''</p>
        <p>One problem is that prices were falling at the same time, so fast that higher unit sales did not necessarily translate into higher revenue or even profitability.</p>
        <p>A big part of that price pressure comes from new computers' learning to do a modem's work without needing modem chip sets. ''The sub-$700 PC and sub-$2,000 notebook went heavily to host-based modems,'' said Mr. Rapiere, using the industry term for software-only communications arrangements. Sales of host-based modems quintupled in 1999, to 30 million units, he said.</p>
        <p>Software-only modems have existed for years, but until recently the burden they put on a computer's microprocessor degraded performance too much for most users. Today's much faster processors have speed to spare, Mr. Rapiere said. ''Unless you're trying to do a lot of complex things all at once, you're probably not going to notice.''</p>
        <p>To exit the business, 3Com said it would form a joint venture with Accton of Taiwan and NatSteel Electronics of Singapore that would buy 3Com's desktop analog modem business, including the U.S. Robotics brand, and its operations making modems for use in laptop computers. Together, they had given 3Com some 60 percent of the market, according to Instat, a market research firm.</p>
        <p>The handoff gives competitors an opportunity to gain share, said Frank Manning, president and chief executive of Zoom Telephonics in Boston, which sells modems under the Zoom and Hayes brand names. ''What 3Com's doing is taking their valuable shelf space and selling it off,'' he said. ''Do I think analog modems are a highly lucrative part of our business? No. But it's very dangerous to just focus on the high-growth areas and abandon customers when a segment slows down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Manning said there were still ways to differentiate modems, through better firmware (the programming embedded in the chip set), better packaging and customer support. A new industrywide technical standard called V.92, due later this year, will make possible new features like call-waiting, higher upload speeds and faster connection setup. ''People think modems are more of a commodity than they actually are,'' he said. ''There actually is room for doing a good job.''</p>
        <p>Branded modem sales were flat in 1999, at about nine million, according to VisionQuest; many more were sold bundled into PC's. But Mr. Manning said it was too soon to say broadband services like D.S.L. and cable had killed off analog modems.</p>
        <p>''The United States is way ahead of the rest of the world in cable modems and D.S.L., but it's still true that most people can't get them,'' Mr. Manning said. ''The base Internet functionality five years from now will still be an analog modem.''</p>
