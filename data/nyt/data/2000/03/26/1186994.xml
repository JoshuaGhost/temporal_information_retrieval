        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your terrifically exhaustive article was just about the final word on a night 30 years ago. There was one slight mention upon which I would like to expand: ''Three bomb makers, Theodore Gold, Diana Oughton and Terry Robbins, were killed.''

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your terrifically exhaustive article was just about the final word on a night 30 years ago. There was one slight mention upon which I would like to expand: ''Three bomb makers, Theodore Gold, Diana Oughton and Terry Robbins, were killed.'' I suppose this mention was obscure to most, but I remember Terry Robbins, and it has always haunted me that he should be in that notorious building and yet die so unnoticed.</p>
        <p>Terry and I attended the same public high school, in Lawrence, L.I. He wasn't particularly political (like Ira Magaziner, a best friend in my class as well) but he was most charming and of a good heart and improvidently for me, we both were infatuated by the same girl. Only he not surprisingly won her heart and then we all went off to college and to live our lives. Yet in no time I read a too familiar ''three people including Terry Robbins died in a bomb blast'' and have never stopped questioning how could he, in just two years, have staked so much and lost it all. What seduced this handsome fellow of intelligence and ingenuous charm. How was it that he was here?</p>
        <p>That was a time of radical transformations, of war and outrage and young men who didn't go off to war and I guess, didn't marry the girl either. But to cook the bomb meant to explode on Morningside Heights . . .? And to end ignominiously forgotten. It didn't and still doesn't make any sense. I have always been fascinated by the ''between.'' Something in the middle doesn't compute.</p>
        <p>Of course I could imagine the filling. Innocence corrupted. Idealism misguided. Or just, wrong place, wrong time. And yet, Terry was so ordinarily balanced it is just startling that perhaps this might have been any one of us.</p>
