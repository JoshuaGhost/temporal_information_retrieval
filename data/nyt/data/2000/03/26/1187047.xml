        <p>Mike Hargrove will not soon forget the Pedro Performance. In a season filled with memorable Pedro performances, the one against the Cleveland Indians last October was the piece de resistance. It was Pedro Martinez at his most resourceful and absolute finest.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely amazing'' was how Hargrove described it, five months later.</p>
        <p>''The thing that Pedro Martinez showed me last year was not so much that he put it on the line for his team,'' Hargrove said. ''It was that Pedro went out and threw the ball 86, 87 miles an hour and was just as dominant a pitcher as he was throwing 95 miles an hour. Not a lot of power pitchers can do that, but Pedro did.''</p>
        <p>The Indians' presence in the playoffs and, as it turned out, Hargrove's job, were on the line when Martinez entered the fifth game of the division series as a relief pitcher in the fourth inning. Martinez would ordinarily have started that final game of the playoff series or the previous one for Boston, but he pulled a muscle in his back in his opening-game start and was not available.</p>
        <p>But with the score tied, 8-8, after three and a half innings, Martinez became available. He pitched the final six innings, allowing no hits or runs, walking three and striking out eight as the Red Sox won, 12-8.</p>
        <p>Martinez is the leader of a starting rotation that has the potential to be very good and very deep this season. Not many teams can boast of such a unit. But this staff comes with a caveat: except for Martinez, the rotation offers no guaranteed winners. Each of Pedro's pitching pals has a question mark attached to his arm. If the pitchers come through, the Yankees could find a huge Red Sox roadblock between themselves and another World Series.</p>
        <p>''I like our players,'' Jimy Williams, Boston's low-key manager, said when asked about his pitchers. ''How well we're going to do I don't know. We got some kids who like to compete. We got some good arms, guys who know how to pitch. Can Ramon sustain what he did at the end of last year? He's shown good arm strength here so far. He feels good about himself. When you have those injury situations, you take one start at a time and build on it hopefully.''</p>
        <p>Ramon Martinez, Pedro's older brother, returned to the major leagues late last season, 14 months after rotator cuff surgery. Gambling that he could return, the Red Sox signed him last year as a future performer. He started four times for them in September (two victories, one loss, a 3.05 earned run average), then twice in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Ramon Martinez, a winner with Los Angeles, who just turned 32, has the prospect of an open-ended victory total -- if his arm remains strong and he remains healthy. Consider where the Red Sox could go if the Martinez brothers were to match the 49 victories the Dean brothers (Dizzy and Paul) gained for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1934, or the 47 they had the next season or even the 38 the Perry brothers (Gaylord and Jim) earned for Cleveland in 1974.</p>
        <p>Jeff Fassero has not been injured, but Joe Kerrigan is trying to nurse him back to good pitching health nevertheless. Kerrigan is the Red Sox pitching coach who held the same job with Montreal when Fassero was building an attractive career there.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox signed Fassero as a free agent, believing his 4-14 record and 7.38 E.R.A. with Seattle last year were an aberration, coming only two seasons after a 16-9, 3.61 season.</p>
        <p>Asked if there was any secret to a turnaround, Williams said: ''Oh, I don't know any secrets. A change of uniform, change of ideas. Joe Kerrigan was with him before. John Cumberland is in the bullpen. If they can help this kid, he could be a big plus for us.''</p>
        <p>Just as they don't know which Fassero they will get, the Red Sox can't be certain about Tim Wakefield. If his knuckleball flutters the way he wants it to and his fielders catch the ball behind him, he could approach the 16-8 record he had in 1995 or the 17-8 he produced two years later.</p>
        <p>Then comes the No. 5 spot in the rotation. It will go to one of two youngsters, both of whom made good impressions last season. Brian Rose, a 24-year-old right-hander, beat the Yankees in his first two starts six days apart. Juan Pena, a 22-year-old right-hander, made only two starts before suffering a shoulder ailment, but in those games he allowed only one run in 13 innings and won them both.</p>
        <p>''Rose and Pena are trying to establish themselves as major leaguers,'' General Manager Dan Duquette said. ''Rose has a little more experience. But they both look like they're capable of helping.''</p>
        <p>The one who doesn't make the rotation for the start of the season will be a short ride away in Pawtucket, R.I. A far more veteran pitcher will be waiting in the on-deck circle, too. Bret Saberhagen, who has vast experience at coming back from injuries, is working his way back from a torn rotator cuff. He has been throwing on the side and hopes to be ready around June 1.</p>
        <p>''The courage that kid showed with a torn muscle in his shoulder trying to play the game is about as good as it gets,'' Williams said. ''Shows a lot of heart. A lot of kids who had this injury, it would be monumental. But because of what he's already gone through, it ain't quite so big. The guy knows how to pitch. He knows what he's doing in a game, what he means to our team as a pitcher. He helps the rest of our staff.''</p>
        <p>The Genius of Maddux</p>
        <p>Before there was Pedro Martinez, Atlanta's Greg Maddux dazzled everyone who faced him or watched him pitch. He still does.</p>
        <p>''I'll tell you what he does better than anyone I've seen since Catfish Hunter,'' said Phil Garner, the Detroit Tigers' manager, who saw Maddux pitching for the Braves when he was managing the Milwaukee Brewers. ''He watches everything. He can see what hitters are doing. He knows when to throw it in and he knows when to throw it away. That's his genius.</p>
        <p>''His skill is that he can do that when he wants to, but his genius is that when he throws the ball, he can see what the hitter is doing. He knows absolutely where to go with it. He's a genius.''</p>
        <p>Astros Need Their Rest</p>
        <p>Jeff Bagwell has played every one of the Houston Astros' 162 games in three of the past four seasons. Craig Biggio has missed a total of four games in the past four seasons. Larry Dierker, their manager, said he would like them to take a few more days off this year.</p>
        <p>''We've talked about it,'' Biggio said. ''Last year we didn't have that luxury to take off days, because we had everybody hurt. I told him I'd take some more off days this year. It depends on when you get them. You don't want an off day in the middle of a week, like a Wednesday night game. You want one like on a travel day and a day game. The older you get, you don't bounce back as quickly.''</p>
        <p>Bagwell said the amount of rest he gets will be up to Dierker. ''That was his intention last year, but we lost so many guys to injuries I didn't have time to take off,'' the first baseman said. ''I was tired in August a little bit. I think everybody's tired in August.''</p>
        <p>Second baseman Biggio said he would not want to take 20 days off in any season. ''That's not going to happen unless I have an injury,'' he said. ''I'll take a couple more days off this year. I'm not down on that. In the long run you will feel better.''</p>
        <p>Bagwell was one of five players who played 162 games last season. The others were John Olerud with the Mets, Sammy Sosa with the Chicago Cubs, Andruw Jones with Atlanta and B. J. Surhoff with Baltimore.</p>
        <p>A Million-Dollar Memory</p>
        <p>His career highs in home runs (38) and runs batted in (112) certainly pleased Jay Bell, but the Arizona Diamondbacks' second baseman was most impressed with the career-high 132 runs he scored last season.</p>
        <p>''Probably the one place that I really put emphasis on my game is runs scored,'' Bell said. ''From the two hole, that is one thing I have to do. Driving in runs is a bonus; scoring runs is mandatory. With everything that happened last year, the home runs, the R.B.I.'s, those things are great. But if those go down a little bit, no big deal. With runs scored, I want to maintain what I did last year.''</p>
        <p>At age 33, in his 12th year in the major leagues, Bell had the season of his life. He had never hit more than 21 home runs, driven in more than 92 runs (and that total was his only one exceeding 71) and scored more than 102. But he was an offensive force in the Diamondbacks' 100-victory, division-championship season.</p>
        <p>''I didn't take a long look at what happened last year,'' Bell said. ''What was fun for me was the one at-bat where I won the lady a million dollars. That's probably the thing I looked at more often than anything else.''</p>
        <p>Bell referred to the grand slam he hit July 11 against Jimmy Haynes of Oakland in an inning that was used for a promotion. If an Arizona batter hit a grand slam, a designated fan would win $1 million.</p>
        <p>''It was ironic how everything happened,'' Bell said. ''Going up there, knowing the situation, bases loaded, two outs, pretty good hitter's count and hitting a home run. It was exciting. The individual stuff was fantastic, but I didn't think about it much. The grand slam and the team success we had, when I did think about the season, that was the focus.''</p>
