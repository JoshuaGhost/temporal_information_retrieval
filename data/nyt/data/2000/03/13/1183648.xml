        <p>The floodwaters in Mozambique have subsided, but the need to provide for the victims is by no means diminished. The United States and other wealthy nations should be generous in providing aid. Nearly a million of Mozambique's 17 million people have lost their homes, farms or food supplies. The official death toll of 400 is expected to rise into the thousands. Tens of thousands of villagers have fled their homes for the safety of high ground. The United Nations says 250,000 Mozambicans are now living in makeshift camps, and another 250,000 remain in ruined villages around the country.</p>
        <p>The most urgent needs are food, tents, medicine and plastic sheeting and blankets. The U.N. estimates that a third of the country's corn, the staple crop, has been destroyed. More than 40,000 head of cattle have drowned, and 141 schools have been obliterated.</p>

        <p>The floodwaters in Mozambique have subsided, but the need to provide for the victims is by no means diminished. The United States and other wealthy nations should be generous in providing aid. Nearly a million of Mozambique's 17 million people have lost their homes, farms or food supplies. The official death toll of 400 is expected to rise into the thousands. Tens of thousands of villagers have fled their homes for the safety of high ground. The United Nations says 250,000 Mozambicans are now living in makeshift camps, and another 250,000 remain in ruined villages around the country.</p>
        <p>The most urgent needs are food, tents, medicine and plastic sheeting and blankets. The U.N. estimates that a third of the country's corn, the staple crop, has been destroyed. More than 40,000 head of cattle have drowned, and 141 schools have been obliterated.</p>
        <p>The long-term economic consequences could be devastating for a country that is still struggling to rebuild from a 16-year civil war that ended in 1992. Mozambique remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita annual income of barely $150. But it had made impressive gains in recent years. The government of Joaquim Chissano had embraced economic reform, encouraging foreign investment, increasing exports and boosting economic growth to close to 10 percent a year, one of the highest rates in the world.</p>
        <p>But flood damage could reduce the country's domestic product by as much as a third. After the first floods in early February, the government and the U.N. issued an urgent appeal for $65 million in foreign aid. They are expected to double or even  triple that request in the coming weeks. So far, foreign donors have pledged more than $100 million. Debt relief would also help. Washington has said  that it will forgive Mozambique's remaining debt.  Britain, Italy, Spain and Portugal will do the same.  The World Bank has accelerated its debt relief program and diverted money from long-term infrastructure to emergency road-building. These are welcome expressions of support for a country that could take years to recover from this disaster.</p>
