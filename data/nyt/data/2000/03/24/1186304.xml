        <p>Bacteria beneath the long fingernails of nurses have been linked to the deaths of babies in an intensive care unit in a hospital in Oklahoma City, federal and Oklahoma health officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Epidemiologists who investigated the outbreak of bacterial infection at Children's Hospital found that about half of the 16 deaths from Jan. 1, 1997, to March 12, 1998, were apparently due to contamination from the long fingernails.</p>
        <p>No deaths from the bacteria have been reported since the hospital imposed measures like requiring that nurses in the neonatal intensive care unit have short nails, Dr. William R. Jarvis, head of the hospital infections program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The infections were caused by bacteria known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The ubiquitous bacteria like moist environments and find their way into respirators and similar devices in hospitals.</p>
        <p>They have been a particular problem in neonatal intensive care units because the sick and underdeveloped babies have compromised immune systems, needles and tubes in their bodies and have become more susceptible to infections because they have often been given antibiotics.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jarvis's study, published in the journal Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology, found that genetic and environmental evidence supported, but did not prove, the link between the deaths of the babies and the long fingernails.</p>
        <p>Although the study could not determine whether the nurses transmitted the bacteria to the babies, or vice versa, once the nurses acquired the bacteria, they could spread them.</p>
        <p>Still, the evidence was strong enough for Dr. Jarvis's team to recommend against use of artificial and long nails in intensive care and transplant units, where the nature of the patients' conditions puts them at greater risk of infection.</p>
        <p>In guidelines issued last year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said workers should not wear long nails in operating rooms. But there were no recommendations for other health care settings.</p>
        <p>Some hospitals have banned long nails, but there has been no uniform policy, in part because some experts believed that more evidence was needed before imposing national rules.</p>
        <p>Dr. J. Michael Crutcher, the Oklahoma state epidemiologist, said cultures of the ears and hands of 104 doctors, nurses and other health care workers showed that three nurses had pseudomonas and two had long fingernails. One had artificial nails, the other's were natural.</p>
        <p>Studies of the genetic types of the pseudomonas showed a strong similarity between those in the three nurses and among the babies.</p>
        <p>The epidemiologists studied possible variables, but found the long nails were the only link.</p>
        <p>After finding the connection, hospital officials began control measures like restricting the use of artificial fingernails and limiting nail length.</p>
