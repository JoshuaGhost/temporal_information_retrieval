        <p>I have to admit, I've never bought anything online, but I do shop around. Window-shop, that is. I guess that's lame, but even though I know it's secure, I still don't trust giving my credit card number out. I mostly look for books.</p>

        <p>CHRISANN KYI, 17  South Salem, N.Y.; John Jay High School</p>
        <p>Project: arteriosclerosis in mice</p>
        <p>I have to admit, I've never bought anything online, but I do shop around. Window-shop, that is. I guess that's lame, but even though I know it's secure, I still don't trust giving my credit card number out. I mostly look for books.</p>
        <p>I go on Amazon.com and on  BarnesandNoble.com to look for obscure books and journals. I've been doing research that is very specific, and there are a lot of sources online that charge for the material.</p>
        <p>I guess I'm lucky, because I have access to the city and the real libraries. I much prefer the personal experience of looking for the books in the library instead of staring at the screen. But for kids doing the same type of research living in some remote place, I think you would have to shop online for all your books and materials.</p>
