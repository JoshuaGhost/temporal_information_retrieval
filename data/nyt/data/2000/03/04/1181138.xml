        <p>An American balloonist's solo bid to circle the world ended well short of that goal yesterday when he landed safely in Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Kevin Uliassi, who had lifted off from a quarry in Rockford, Ill., 10 days before, brought his balloon down in central Myanmar, formerly Burma, about 300 miles north of Yangon, formerly Rangoon. He had traveled 13,246 miles, more than halfway around the globe.</p>

        <p>An American balloonist's solo bid to circle the world ended well short of that goal yesterday when he landed safely in Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Kevin Uliassi, who had lifted off from a quarry in Rockford, Ill., 10 days before, brought his balloon down in central Myanmar, formerly Burma, about 300 miles north of Yangon, formerly Rangoon. He had traveled 13,246 miles, more than halfway around the globe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Uliassi's wife, Renee, said in a telephone interview from the mission's command center in Homewood, Ill., that transmissions from the balloon indicated that her husband had made a controlled descent from about 30,000 feet. He suffered bruises in landing and was taken to a hospital, where he was to spend the night, Mrs. Uliassi said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Uliassi left a message on a family answering machine to report that he was safe, but his support team had not heard directly from him.</p>
        <p>''We have no idea why he came down,'' Mrs. Uliassi said.</p>
        <p>She added that the last conversation with him was about 3:30 p.m. Central time Thursday, about 13 hours before the landing. At that time he reported no problems.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Uliassi said that by coincidence a British balloonist and his team were in Myanmar and had offered to help her husband pack up the balloon for shipment home.</p>
        <p>''I'm not disappointed whatsoever,'' Mrs. Uliassi said. ''For Kevin and me it was a success just to put a balloon together.''</p>
        <p>After a relatively slow start across the Atlantic, the 160-foot-high balloon, named the J. Renee in honor of Mrs. Uliassi, had caught favorable winds in the middle of the week and had traveled at more than 100 miles an hour as it crossed India on Thursday. Mr. Uliassi had been scheduled to have a discussion with his support team on Friday about whether he had enough fuel and oxygen to proceed over the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Mr. Uliassi, 36, was trying to become the third person to fly a balloon nonstop around the world, and the first to do it alone. A team of two Europeans accomplished the feat in a similar balloon last year. Mr. Uliassi's trip, however, did not even set a record for solo balloon travel; that mark, of more than 14,000 miles, was established by Steve Fossett, a wealthy Chicago businessman, in 1998.</p>
        <p>This was Mr. Uliassi's second bid at an around-the-world trip and was far more successful than the first, which ended shortly after launching when the balloon ruptured. Like that mission, this one was run on a shoestring, with an all-volunteer support crew and no deep-pocket backers.</p>
        <p>''He's basically flying all his assets,'' a spokesman, Scott Lorenz, said on Thursday.</p>
