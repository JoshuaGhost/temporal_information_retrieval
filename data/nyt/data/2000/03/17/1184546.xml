        <p>Dow Up Nearly 500 Points In Biggest Daily Point Gain  Investors bought stocks furiously, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 500 points in its biggest one-day point gain ever. Broader indexes also rose sharply as investors -- at least for the day -- put aside fears that the Federal Reserve will aggressively raise interest rates and slow the economy to a crawl.</p>
        <p>The Dow gained 499.19 points, or nearly 5 percent, to 10,630.60. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index ended three days of sharp losses with a gain of 134.77 points, or nearly 3 percent, to 4,717.39. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 66.32 points, or 4.8 percent, to 1,458.47.</p>

        <p>Disk Drive Breakthrough Reported  A group of I.B.M. scientists said it had achieved a breakthrough that could result in one-inch disk drives capable of holding 100 times the data of the most sophisticated existing hard drives. The breakthrough is significant for the emerging field of nanotechnology, an effort to build microscopic circuitry and machines only a few molecules in size.</p>

        <p>U.S. Candidate Out of I.M.F. Race  The five-month-long scramble to find a new leader for the International Monetary Fund came to a de facto conclusion as the Japanese and American rivals for the job -- Eisuke Sakakibara and Stanley Fischer -- formally withdrew their nominations and cleared a path for a German, Horst Kohler.</p>

        <p>Nasdaq Spinoff Plan Is Released  The fine print on the National Association of Securities Dealers' plan to issue stock and spin off the Nasdaq stock market later this year became public. While N.A.S.D. executives predict the deal will pass a membership vote easily, some small brokerage firms expressed hostility to the offering in a conference call. Another group may file suit to stop the deal.</p>

        <p>Wall St. Urged to Disclose All Orders  The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt, called on Wall Street to voluntarily put together a system that would disclose all stock orders that have not yet been filled. All markets are now required to disclose any limit orders -- orders to buy or sell a stock at a particular price -- if that order represents the best available price in the market. Mr. Levitt proposed going further than that, but he also said that he was ''deeply troubled'' by evidence that even the disclosures required are often not being made.</p>

        <p>Peapod Exploring a Possible Sale  Peapod, the pioneer of the online grocery business, announced that its chief executive, Bill Malloy, would be leaving for health reasons. Then a group of investors who had promised to put $120 million into the company said they would not be doing so, given the departure of Mr. Malloy. The company said it had asked its investment bank to explore alternatives, including a sale.</p>

        <p>Credit Suisse Comes Under Scrutiny  Allegations of improprieties in the way the Ukrainian central bank managed International Monetary Fund loans are raising serious questions about the role of Credit Suisse, the European banking giant, in the matter.</p>

        <p>February Producer Prices Rose 1%  Prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers rose 1 percent last month, but excluding food and energy costs they rose 0.3 percent. Reports showing gains in housing starts and manufacturing suggested that the economy was continuing its robust expansion.</p>

        <p>Some Mutual Funds Not Available  About 735 mutual funds that are normally listed in the tables were not available because of a technical problem at the Interactive Data Corporation, which provides some pricing data.</p>
