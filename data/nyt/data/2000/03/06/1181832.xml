        <p>Israel's cabinet pledged today to withdraw its soldiers by July from the embattled strip of southern Lebanon that they have occupied since 1982, preferably, but not necessarily, in the context of an accord with Syria.</p>
        <p>The resolution, adopted unanimously, gives extra teeth to the solo promises of a withdrawal made in the last eight months by Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who set ambitious deadlines when he took office for securing regional peace on the Lebanese, Syrian and Palestinian fronts.</p>
        <p>As an official statement of government policy, as opposed to simply Mr. Barak's word, it stands particularly as a challenge to Syria, which has used the Israeli presence to justify its support of the Lebanese guerrillas who have waged a costly war of attrition against the Israeli troops.</p>
        <p>The resolution stressed that the withdrawal would preferably take place in the context of a peace agreement. If there is none, it added, the cabinet will hold another discussion about how to carry out the withdrawal. It did not specifically make the withdrawal contingent on an accord.</p>
        <p>''We have cut today the Gordian knot between Syria and Lebanon,'' said Haim Ramon, a cabinet member who is close to Mr. Barak. ''If the Syrians want to reach an agreement, and it is preferable that an agreement be reached, good.''</p>
        <p>If not, he added, ''we will leave without an agreement, we will bring the boys home, and we will defend the northern communities from the international border with all of our might.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak's negotiations with Syria have been stalled for nearly two months, a period that saw a sharp rise in attacks by Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The prime minister said today that he could not predict whether the pullout would take place under the umbrella of a peace deal.</p>
        <p>''We have contacts with the Americans,'' he told Israel 2 television. ''We do not have any contacts with the Syrians. I cannot say that I know whether the talks will be renewed at all, and therefore I certainly cannot say whether they will succeed.''</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Barak's ministers have openly advocated a unilateral pullout, with or without a peace treaty with Syria. But the prime minister, clearly hoping to get a peace deal in partial exchange for leaving Lebanon, has not gone so far in his public statements.</p>
        <p>Israeli experts have said the Barak government believes that if there is no agreement within the next two to three months, then there will be no chance for one until well into next year, when a new American president might be able to turn his attention to the Middle East.</p>
        <p>In 1978, Israel sent troops to Lebanon to crush Palestinian guerrillas who were attacking across the border. After the full-scale invasion of Lebanon in 1982, Israeli leaders argued that the impotence of the government in chaotic Lebanon meant that they could secure their northern border only by stationing troops inside Lebanon. A nine-mile-deep ''security zone'' was formally created in 1985.</p>
        <p>The occupation has exacted a high price: From 1995 through 1999, 123 Israeli soldiers and one civilian have been killed in southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Upon taking office on July 7, Mr. Barak set a deadline of one year for bringing the troops home. While the prospect of leaving the killing zone in southern Lebanon appeals to much of the Israeli public, the cabinet did not start discussing it until this month.</p>
        <p>Recently, a series of Hezbollah ambushes and bombings killed seven Israeli soldiers in the zone within three weeks, prompting a wave of retaliatory Israeli missile attacks that continued today.</p>
        <p>The recent surge in violence has led some Israeli military officials to question whether they could withdraw in a diplomatic vacuum without exposing Israeli civilians and soldiers to guerrilla attacks.</p>
        <p>A pullout under the terms of an agreement with Syria, on the other hand, would presumably mean that Syria would rein in Hezbollah and provide security for the departing Israelis and their Lebanese Christian allies.</p>
        <p>Arab officials have expressed similar misgivings about a unilateral Israeli withdrawal that could invite Hezbollah attacks on departing troops and deteriorate into another destabilizing conflict.</p>
        <p>In Beirut, for instance, Prime Minister Selim al-Hoss of Lebanon reacted with restrained enthusiasm today to the cabinet vote.</p>
        <p>''We wish the pullout will take place in accordance with an agreement,'' he said. ''But should Israel decide to withdraw unilaterally, Lebanon would accept that.''</p>
        <p>In Israel, the grinding occupation of southern Lebanon has long been unpopular and becomes even more so whenever young army conscripts are killed or wounded. Opinion polls have indicated recently that nearly two-thirds of Israelis would support a withdrawal even without an accompanying peace treaty.</p>
        <p>Some opponents of Mr. Barak's peace initiatives with Syria, among them Ariel Sharon, have also pushed for a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon. Mr. Sharon, the chairman of the opposition Likud Party and one of the architects of the Israeli invasion 18 years ago, said today that a withdrawal should start now.</p>
        <p>Israeli experts have said the right wing thinks that if Syria and Israel do reach a peace accord, Mr. Barak might well link it in a public referendum to the troop withdrawal. Presented with the choice, then, Israelis might well vote to accept peace with Syria, even at the cost of giving up the Golan Heights, if getting the soldiers home is the reward.</p>
        <p>Whatever the domestic implications, an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon would shift the ground under many of the region's political and military forces.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah, for instance, established itself as a resistance movement of Shiite Muslims fighting the Israeli occupation. But it has since moved into the political arena in Lebanon and holds seats in Parliament.</p>
        <p>Still, its military operations depend on Syria's acquiescence to arms transfers from Iran. Syria has traditionally unleashed Hezbollah, as it apparently did in recent weeks, to remind Israel that it counts in the regional peace equation. Iran, too, has used Hezbollah, mostly as a lever on Lebanon.</p>
        <p>If the Israelis are gone from Lebanon and Hezbollah's need for arms is reduced, the role and the influence of its patrons may lessen as well.</p>
        <p>Last week, Syria's foreign minister, Farouk al-Shara, predicted that unilateral withdrawal would be akin to Israel's committing ''suicide.''</p>
        <p>''If they want to pull out unilaterally, let them do that,'' he said in an interview in the London-based Arabic daily Al Hayat. ''They will bear the consequences and should never use this possibility as a means of pressure against us.''</p>
