        <p>Pope John Paul II opened the first official visit by a pope to Israel today, declaring after he landed in Tel Aviv that he felt ''deep emotion'' on setting foot ''in the land where God chose to pitch his tent.'' Immediately on his arrival, he was also given a taste of the fierce politics that are likely to vein his long-awaited pilgrimage to the Holy Land.</p>
        <p>The outspoken Israeli president,  Ezer Weizman, welcomed the pope  with a blunt, at times defensive speech that instantly bore into one of the issues dividing the Vatican and the Jewish state.</p>
        <p>''You are arriving this evening in Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel, the heart of the Jewish world, which is also a holy site for Christianity and Islam,'' Mr. Weizman told the frail 79-year-old pope.</p>
        <p>The pope listened, hunched under an umbrella beneath a light drizzle in Tel Aviv, after a military band played ''Jerusalem of Gold,'' a song that celebrates the return of Jewish holy sites after the 1967 war. ''Jerusalem is the city of eternity, a city that has been reunified,'' Mr. Weizman said.</p>
        <p>Like most states, the Vatican has never recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and has argued that it should be granted ''internationally recognized'' status as a holy city. A top Vatican diplomat recently angered Israeli officials by saying East Jerusalem, the part of the city seized by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, was ''illegally occupied.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli viewpoint was driven home even more directly tonight when the pope's helicopter arrived at a heliport in East Jerusalem. Jerusalem's mayor, Ehud Olmert, greeted him there, saying ''Welcome to the eternal capital of Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Abu Ala, speaker of the Palestinian legislature, watched the helicopter's arrival on television, and said he was stunned and appalled by Mr. Olmert's unscripted presence in East Jerusalem, whose final status remains to be negotiated.</p>
        <p>The pope arrived in Israel from Jordan, where this morning he held a Mass for 40,000 people in Amman, and prayed on the eastern bank of the Jordan River at Wadi al Kharrar, one of the sites held to be the place where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.</p>
        <p>The import of John Paul's visit to Israel, the first by a pope officially as a head of state, was underscored by the welcome he received at Ben Gurion International Airport. He was greeted by President Weizman, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and several cabinet ministers -- though no  ultra-Orthodox government minister attended.</p>
        <p>A few rabbis joined a contingent of  Muslim clerics and representatives of all Christian faiths, including Greek Orthodox. But neither of the two Israeli chief rabbis was present. A Foreign Ministry official said they were attending prayer services for the eve of Purim, the holiday celebrating Jewish survival.</p>
        <p>Three children from Jesus' boyhood town of Nazareth -- one Jewish, one Muslim and one Christian -- were on hand on the tarmac as the pope arrived in a Jordanian Airlines jet, which was fitted with Israeli and Vatican flags after landing. The pope's white skullcap blew off in the strong wind, and he raised a trembling hand in the air in a wave before kissing a pot of Israeli soil offered by the children. When he finished his speech, delivered in English, he saluted his hosts with the Hebrew word ''shalom,'' or peace.</p>
        <p>John Paul showed no sign of being taken aback by Israeli officials' public broaching of a sensitive political topic usually left to diplomatic channels.</p>
        <p>He has long dreamed of leading a Holy Year pilgrimage to the sites where Jesus lived and died. But in his remarks at the Tel Aviv airport, he also raised a larger mission in the Middle East.</p>
        <p>Addressing President Weizman as a ''peacemaker,'' the pope said, ''We all know how urgent is the need for peace and justice, not for Israel alone but for the entire region.'' He said the world closely followed ''the peace process which finds all the peoples of the region involved in the difficult search for a lasting peace with justice for all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weizman did not suggest that Israel needed help in resolving territorial disputes. ''From the very outset, our hand has been outstretched in peace to our Arab neighbors,'' he told the pope.</p>
        <p>The pope hopes to use his visit to Israel to promote interfaith reconciliation and lend his moral authority to the quest for peace. But his unique international stature is equally coveted by Israelis, who want him to reinforce their sovereign rights, and by Palestinians, who hope his visits to Palestinian leaders and a Palestinian refugee camp on Wednesday will lend legitimacy to their cause.</p>
        <p>The relationship with Israel, however, is more complex, clouded by Jewish memories of centuries of anti-Semitism and charges that the Catholic Church failed to speak out sufficiently against the Holocaust during World War II.</p>
        <p>When Pope Paul VI visited the Holy Land in 1964, he was gratefully received by Israeli officials of the time, who welcomed those early, pioneering efforts toward reconciliation between Jews and Catholics. But few Israelis have forgotten that Pope Paul spent only 12 hours in their country, and pointedly never referred to it as Israel.</p>
        <p>The Vatican and Israel established diplomatic relations in 1994. The pope, who has on several occasions apologized for some Catholics' failure to protect Jews during the Holocaust and repeated that regret this month in a sweeping apology for the historic sins of his church, wants to use his visit to heal lingering wounds.</p>
        <p>Tonight, saying the Vatican's diplomatic recognition of Israel ''set a seal on efforts to open an era of dialogue,'' the pope urged continued progress. ''With new-found openness toward one another, Christians and Jews together must make courageous efforts to remove all forms of prejudice,'' he said tonight. ''We must strive always and everywhere to present the true face of the Jews and Judaism, as likewise of Christians and Christianity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weizman, who mentioned the Holocaust twice in his remarks, said he ''appreciated'' the pope's ''request for forgiveness for deeds carried out in the past by representatives of the church against the Jewish people.'' Saying he was mindful of how the church's teaching has shifted to recognize ''the Jewish people as it defines itself,'' the Israeli president said it was now ''important for the men and women in the church to also become familiar with the modern Israeli reality.''</p>
        <p>The Israel John Paul glimpsed tonight is radically different from the one he explored in 1963, when he went on a pilgrimage there as a bishop from Cracow. In a letter he wrote to fellow Polish bishops describing his trip, he focused on the religious sites he toured, painstakingly describing shrines and churches few of his colleagues in Communist Poland could visit themselves. But the political strains of the time did not entirely escape his notice.</p>
        <p>''Today's Jerusalem is divided between Jews and Arabs, and the Jews do not have access to the Wailing Wall,'' he wrote then. ''All the temple area belongs to the Muslims.''</p>
