        <p>Who wants to be a millionaire? Almost every character in ''Romeo Must Die,'' the first English-language starring vehicle for the Hong Kong action star Jet Li. There's Isaak (Delroy Lindo), who is waging an intimidation campaign against waterfront business owners so he can buy up their properties, like that of Silk (DMX), whose club may end up as the last standing opposition to Isaak's ambition. Mac (Isaiah Washington), Isaak's bad-tempered right-hand man, pushes around the people clinging to their shops and businesses while dreaming of his own day in the sun.</p>
        <p>Everybody's scrambling to get paid. There are only two honorable people in the undercooked picture, Trish (Aaliyah), Isaak's daughter, and Han (Mr. Li), a Hong Kong cop doing time in a Chinese prison; he took a rap so that his brother and father could slip out of the country. When word that his little brother has been killed gets back to Han, he stages an escape so daring that even the prison's guards are shaking their heads in disbelief, and he makes his way to the United States to investigate his brother's death. He kicks the story into gear.</p>

        <p>Who wants to be a millionaire? Almost every character in ''Romeo Must Die,'' the first English-language starring vehicle for the Hong Kong action star Jet Li.

        <p>Everybody's scrambling to get paid. There are only two honorable people in the undercooked picture, Trish (Aaliyah), Isaak's daughter, and Han (Mr. Li), a Hong Kong cop doing time in a Chinese prison; he took a rap so that his brother and father could slip out of the country. When word that his little brother has been killed gets back to Han, he stages an escape so daring that even the prison's guards are shaking their heads in disbelief, and he makes his way to the United States to investigate his brother's death. He kicks the story into gear.</p>
        <p>''Romeo,'' which doesn't really include a Romeo and has only the most fleeting reference to Shakespeare, is the first movie that looks as if it was cast from the rap magazine The Source due to its relatively chaste marriage of hip-hop and kung fu. In fact, there's barely a shot in the movie that wouldn't make a great magazine cover. The movie is overly dutiful in dragging itself through the exercise of playing out its plot elements, ignoring the chief lesson of its Hong Kong antecedents: extend the martial gymnastics.</p>
        <p>If the academy ever decides to give out Oscars for sheer physical exertion, the other contenders will have to line up behind Mr. Li. His mastery of the martial art known as wushu made Mr. Li a star years ago to the fans of Hong Kong movies, with their exhilarating blur of stunts and minimal-to-the-point-of-confusion story lines. For the first half-hour or so, ''Romeo'' is very smart about giving Mr. Li little dialogue  since his command of English doesn't match his grasp of hand-to-hand combat. Mr. Li is a comical presence because of his Bruce-Lee-on-a-key-chain size. Even the willowy Aaliyah seems to have a couple of inches on him, so his bouts with the SUV-size thugs who snort vengefully into his hairline are jokey.</p>
        <p>''Romeo'' is a come-on, with cooing hip-hop songs popping up whenever Aaliyah, who's a natural, glides across the screen. The picture was conceived as a spotlight dance for Aaliyah and Mr. Li, but they have so little chemistry together you'd think  they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Mr. Li's filmography includes the revered ''Fist of Legend,'' a picture whose awe-inspiring assemblage of flying feet and soaring fists was the basis of the mano-a-mano choreography of ''The Matrix,'' and he's much better when he bursts into hyperactivity than when batting around coy badinage.</p>
        <p>When the action gets serious and a fatal blow is struck, there's a cut to a computer-animated version of viscera taking the impact. All in the name of good taste, of course. Unfortunately, it's Western technology that gets in the way of Eastern thrill-seeking workouts, and since Mr. Li does all of his own stunts, it's a peculiar annoyance.</p>
        <p>Instead of the snarling come-hither of Bruce Lee and his imitators, Mr. Li's round face takes on a beatific serenity before he goes to work on one of his Cinemascope beatdowns. Those are more dramatic than the rest of the picture, but they're chopped together like a ransom note, all slivers and pieces. You catch Mr. Li in bite-size chunks instead of the family-style helpings in his other work, like the bravura punches and stag's leaps of the ''Once Upon a Time in China'' series, films that raised the deadly swift Mr. Li to a myth. (They're worth seeking out, no matter what part of town you have to get to in order to rent them.)</p>
        <p>The camera prowls into each shot as if it's searching for an opponent to throw down against; the movie itself seems to be spoiling for a fight, though it doesn't have the attention span to concentrate on the battles it does have. Mr. Li beats up his foes the old-fashioned way: one at a time. Dreary as it is, ''Romeo'' is bound to be a hit, thanks to its well-selected and wall-to-wall hip-hop soundtrack -- particularly good songs by Timbaland and, yes, Aaliyah -- that's so pervasive ''Romeo'' might as well be a musical. DMX emerges as a star in the scattered proceedings. He establishes so much audience rapport in his brief time onscreen that the film suffers from his absence. DMX showed star power in ''Belly,'' his debut, and he clearly takes acting seriously. More seriously than ''Romeo'' regards the able Jet Li. Sadly, if this movie was a fight, they'd have stopped it.</p>
        <p>This film is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extended scenes of Mr. Li's action choreography and violence, strong language and gunplay.</p>
