        <p>If members of the United States Alpine team rode horses instead of skis, Daron Rahlves and Kristina Koznick might be considered white knights. The connotation comes with good reason -- although part fun and part serious.</p>
        <p>Both Alpine skiers, they have in the past dyed their sandy-colored hair white, and now they are about to do it again. But if that isn't enough to single them out, then check their World Cup ski results for the last month.</p>
        <p>Rahlves, a 26-year-old speed specialist from Truckee, Calif., and Koznick, 24, a technical expert from Burnsville, Minn., streaked through the final races of the international Alpine circuit with career-boosting victories.</p>
        <p>Now they are primed for an appearance beginning tomorrow in the Chevy Truck U.S. Alpine championships in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The event ends next Wednesday with the men's and women's slalom at nearby Snow King, Wyo. Not since the heyday of Tommy Moe and Picabo Street at the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, has the United States Ski Team had so much hope for a comeback to the medal podium.</p>
        <p>Rahlves rocketed to the upper echelon of cup skiing by capturing two first-place finishes this month at the World Cup races in Kvitfjell, Norway. Then he earned fifth- and sixth-place finishes in subsequent super giant slalom races -- one after losing a pole near the top.</p>
        <p>Entrenched at the same pinnacle of skiing achievement are members of the nearly indomitable Austrian team, including the powerful Hermann Maier, overall World Cup champion this year. Rahlves finished the season in 20th place over all, and 10th in both super-G and downhill.</p>
        <p>''For sure, the biggest thing for me is knowing that I can do it,'' Rahlves said in a telephone interview from Truckee. ''I was struggling earlier this season and really bummed about how things were going. But no one intimidates me now. Maier is an incredible athlete, but I beat him twice in the downhill.''</p>
        <p>The dips between his best and his worst have been particularly steep for Rahlves. Having dealt with the pain and frustration of a dislocated hip twice during his seven seasons on the United States ski team, Rahlves has become a slave to physical conditioning. At 5 feet 9 inches and 180 pounds, he can't depend on brawn to bail him out. Instead, he has depended on determination.</p>
        <p>''He's been very doggish, very persistent,'' said Randy Graves, Rahlves's ski and boot technician during the early 1990's. ''I was sitting down with him last year at the nationals, and out of the blue, he mentioned how his dislocated hip had caused him the most excruciating pain. I thought to myself, any other kid would have said, 'That's enough.' But with Daron, it's always, 'What's the next step?' ''</p>
        <p>The same could be said for Koznick. Recurring back problems nearly crippled her in the middle of her nine-year stint on the United States team. But now the back pain has become a nagging ache softened by regular physical therapy. She has also recovered from a single but stultifying moment of mental anguish -- skiing off course during her much ballyhooed debut at the 1998 Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan.</p>
        <p>Finishing the season last week with back-to-back victories in the slalom, and placing second and fourth in the two previous slalom races, Koznick rocketed into fifth place in the event, and 19th over all.</p>
        <p>Early on, shorter shaped skis stilted her progress. But the equipment produced a swing up the learning curve; everyone else was on shaped skis and registered better finishes.</p>
        <p>''As the year went on, I was patient with my new skis,'' Koznick said in a telephone interview from Italy. ''Every time I had a good run, I got more and more confident.''</p>
        <p>The decision to dye her hair white has nothing to do with her improved results. Rather, she still remembers having fun with her new look during the world championships last year. ''I definitely did it so people would notice me more, and it definitely worked,'' she said. ''That's the way it is. Sports is entertainment.''</p>
        <p>As for Rahlves, the white hairdo goes with his ''Beach Boy'' nickname, which mostly comes from his love of surfing. But white hair or no, Rahlves said, ''I think the best way to  grab attention is to ski fast.''</p>
        <p>Rahlves and Koznick will be available for questions in an Internet chat room (http://chat.yahoo.com) today from 9 to 10 p.m. Eastern time.  THE SKI REPORT</p>
