        <p>An immigration lawyer went on a shooting spree on the outskirts of Pittsburgh yesterday afternoon, killing five people, including a Jewish woman, two Asian men, one Indian and one black man and critically injuring a sixth, police officials said.</p>
        <p>The suspect, Richard Baumhammers, 34, was pulled over in his Jeep and arrested at 3:30 p.m. in the town of Ambridge, two hours after the police uncovered a 15-mile trail of death that ran through two shopping centers and crossed three townships.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baumhammers stays with his parents on Elm Spring Road in Mount Lebanon, where neighbors described the family as ''pillars of the community.'' His father, Andrejs, is a periodontist who teaches part time at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baumhammers is licensed to practice law in Georgia and Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>He was arraigned last night on one count of criminal homicide in the shooting at a martial arts school, and the F.B.I. has joined the investigation  to determine whether the shooting spree was a hate crime.</p>
        <p>The killings followed another shooting spree with racist overtones in Pittsburgh, which occurred on March 2. In that incident, a black man opened fire in two fast-food restaurants during lunchtime, after proclaiming, ''I'm just out to shoot white men.''</p>
        <p>The gunman in that case, Ronald Taylor, surrendered to police, but his actions left a deep reservoir of fear and grief.</p>
        <p>Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania,  addressing a Republican group in Pebble Beach, Calif., last night said: ''Not again. Those are the first words that come to mind. Not again.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Across Pennsylvania, and particularly in southwestern Pennsylvania, we are struggling to make sense of what appears to be yet another brutal racist rampage.''</p>
        <p>The grim afternoon began for law enforcement officials at 1 p.m., when a fire alarm went off at 792 Elm Spring Road, said Paul Wolf, acting superintendent for the Allegheny County Police.</p>
        <p>When police officers and firefighters arrived at the house next door to Mr. Baumhammers's, Mr. Wolf said, they found the body of a neighbor, Anita Gordon, 63, who had been shot to death. The house was also burning after a rug was set on fire.</p>
        <p>At 1:49 p.m., the police received a call about a shooting in neighboring Scott Township. There, at a store called India grocery in the Scott Town Center, a 30-year-old man was found with multiple gunshot wounds.</p>
        <p>He was pronounced dead at Allegheny General Hospital at 5:32 p.m.  Another victim was taken to Mercy Hospital, and remained in serious condition last night. Police did not release the victims' names, but the wounded man was identified by The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last night as Patil Sandip, 24, of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Kent Kretzler, the owner of Travel Connection, was working next door to the grocery when he said he heard loud sounds.</p>
        <p>''I thought they were pounding on the wall next door,'' he said. ''I thought, 'What in the world are they doing over there?' ''</p>
        <p>He said he then saw a man walking away from the grocery with his arm extended backward pointing a revolver at the grocery. ''Then he calmly and coolly walked along the sidewalk to his car,'' Mr. Kretzler said, adding that the man sat in his black Jeep Cherokee for about a minute before driving off.</p>
        <p>The police said they believed Mr. Baumhammers next fired shots through the windows and front door of a nearby synagogue, the Beth El Congregation in Mount Lebanon. He then went on to another synagogue, Ahavath Achim, in Carnegie, and fired shots outside, shattering the windows, the police said. No injuries were reported in those incidents.</p>
        <p>The next report came at 2:25 p.m., said Mr. Wolf, when the police in Robinson Township received reports of a shooting at a Chinese restaurant, Ya Fei Chinese Cuisine. Two Asian men there were shot from five to six feet away, Mr. Wolf said, one in the face and one in the chest. Both were pronounced dead at the scene.</p>
        <p>A cook there, Vinh Truong, said an employee ran into the kitchen and told everyone to escape, but Mr. Truong said he found his brother-in-law, whom he identified as Tony, on the floor.</p>
        <p>Some time after that, a dispatcher in Beaver Township received the next call. This time, the police found the body of a 25-year-old black man at the C. S. Kim Karate School, who died from a single gunshot wound to the chest.</p>
        <p>After the shooting at the martial arts school, the police said, Mr. Baumhammers drove toward Pittsburgh. The police in Aliquippa spotted his Jeep and followed it across the Ohio River into Ambridge, where officers from both towns arrested Mr. Baumhammers about 3:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Officers cornered his vehicle and drew their weapons, but Mr. Baumhammers calmly surrendered, police officials said. A handgun and spent shells, along with unused bullets, were found in his vehicle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baumhammers was taken to the Center Township police station were he was questioned for five hours. During the interrogation, his only comment was to ask to speak with a lawyer, an official with the Center Township police told a reporter in a televised interview.</p>
        <p>His sister, Daina Baumhammers Pack, a radiologist in Millersville, Md., said last night when reached by telephone: ''This is an absolutely devastating thing for our family. It's the most awful thing that can happen to a family, and I feel terrible for the victims' families and for my own parents.''</p>
        <p>A resident of Elm Spring Road, Lois Castello, said that the Baumhammers had lived on the street a long time. She said the son lived there, ''but not all the time.''</p>
