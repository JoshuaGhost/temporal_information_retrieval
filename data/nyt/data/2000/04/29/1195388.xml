        <p>In 1994, offended in an argument, a young Brazilian named Leandro Luis Bernardo Dias strangled a man and dumped his body in a river. Now he sits in Carandiru prison, the world's largest, with 7,200 people. It is a place seething with suspicion, drugs, betrayals, stabbings and AIDS, with hymns that come at close of day and cries of protest that announce the night.</p>
        <p>The prison is the underside of Brazil's startling development in the past decade. Luxury goods have arrived, but violence has soared as the gulf between rich and poor has become more glaring. Murders in Sao Paulo now exceed 8,500 a year -- constituting ''an undeclared civil war,'' in the words of a social worker.</p>

        <p>In 1994, offended in an argument, a young Brazilian named Leandro Luis Bernardo Dias strangled a man and dumped his body in a river. Now he sits in Carandiru prison, the world's largest, with 7,200 people. It is a place seething with suspicion, drugs, betrayals, stabbings and AIDS, with hymns that come at close of day and cries of protest that announce the night.</p>
        <p>The prison is the underside of Brazil's startling development in the past decade. Luxury goods have arrived, but violence has soared as the gulf between rich and poor has become more glaring. Murders in Sao Paulo now exceed 8,500 a year -- constituting ''an undeclared civil war,'' in the words of a social worker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dias is one of the many killers. At 25, he has known violence, despair and fear, and now, in the cells of Carandiru, he has found faith. ''Fear lives inside every prisoner,'' he says. ''Fear of the violence. Fear of this all-male darkness. Fear you will never get out. But I talk to God every day and ask him to see me through.''</p>
        <p>Two days spent with Mr. Dias inside Carandiru and an investigation of the murder reveal a nuanced story of personal redemption far more complex than the brutal killings suggest.</p>
