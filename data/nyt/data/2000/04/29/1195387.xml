        <p>As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani pursues his treatment options for prostate cancer, the person he will be relying on more than ever is the man who runs the city when the mayor is out of town or otherwise unavailable: Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, who is as hot-tempered and bombastic as his boss.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lhota, 45, is also known for his independence, irreverence and relative openness in a City Hall inner circle that is as fearful of the mayor as it is loyal. Colleagues say that he has an unmatched knowledge of city government, while City Council members praise him for a willingness to compromise -- a quality not in abundance in this administration.</p>

        <p>As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani pursues his treatment options for prostate cancer, the person he will be relying on more than ever is the man who runs the city when the mayor is out of town or otherwise unavailable: Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, who is as hot-tempered and bombastic as his boss.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lhota, 45, is also known for his independence, irreverence and relative openness in a City Hall inner circle that is as fearful of the mayor as it is loyal. Colleagues say that he has an unmatched knowledge of city government, while City Council members praise him for a willingness to compromise -- a quality not in abundance in this administration.</p>
        <p>It is Mr. Lhota who would be in charge of the city should the mayor undergo prostate surgery, and it is Mr. Lhota who may run the city if the mayor is in the hospital for an extended time.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Lhota at first declined to be interviewed on the subject, perhaps worried that he would be seen as promoting himself during Mr. Giuliani's illness. But his method of saying no was unique in Mr. Giuliani's tightly wrapped City Hall.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to talk about that subject!'' Mr. Lhota bellowed yesterday from his office to a reporter standing several hundred feet down a corridor at City Hall. ''Do it without me!'' Mr. Lhota also declined to have his picture taken. When a reporter said it would be good to have a photograph displaying his recent weight loss (he has previously been described as barrel shaped), Mr. Lhota rolled his eyes, smiled wickedly, and cheerfully made an obscene gesture.</p>
        <p>Later in the day, Mr. Lhota relented and gave a brief interview, although he was careful to say that he relied on three other deputy mayors -- Anthony P. Coles, Robert Harding and Rudy Washington -- when Mr. Giuliani was out of town. And he added: ''While I am on paper acting mayor, my job is to keep the mayor informed at all times.'' Mr. Giuliani, in any case, is the kind of mayor who phones frequently.</p>
        <p>Although the City Charter has lengthy and elaborate provisions for a line of succession should a mayor have ''an inability to discharge the powers and duties'' of his office, those conditions are not interpreted to include treatable illnesses like prostate cancer. ''It's designed to be an extreme case, and that's appropriate to keep government orderly and stable,'' said Laurel Eisner, the general counsel in the office of Mark Green, the public advocate.</p>
        <p>But should a mayor fall into a serious, extended illness, the charter provides for the mayor to either voluntarily declare an inability to discharge his powers, or for an ''inability committee'' to do so. Such a committee is composed of five officials, including the public advocate and the city comptroller, who are next in the line of succession.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 2, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Saturday about Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota of New York misstated the composition of an ''inability committee'' that would decide on succession should a mayor be unable to serve out the term. The committee comprises the corporation counsel, the comptroller, the speaker of the City Council, a deputy mayor designated by the mayor, and the borough president with the longest consecutive service. The committee does not include the public advocate.</p>
