        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>It is a sad day for society when sports teams must issue travel advisories to their fans similar to airlines warning passengers flying to dangerous foreign countries. Unfortunately, that is what is needed to protect New York sports fans attending events in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Try wearing your Giants jersey to a Philadelphia Eagles football game. Maybe wear your Mets jersey to a Phillies game. Or your Rangers jersey to a Flyers game. Sit quietly, try to enjoy the game and see how long it takes to be verbally and/or physically abused by people purporting to be Philadelphia sports fans.</p>

        <p>It is a sad day for society when sports teams must issue travel advisories to their fans similar to airlines warning passengers flying to dangerous foreign countries. Unfortunately, that is what is needed to protect New York sports fans attending events in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Try wearing your Giants jersey to a Philadelphia Eagles football game. Maybe wear your Mets jersey to a Phillies game. Or your Rangers jersey to a Flyers game. Sit quietly, try to enjoy the game and see how long it takes to be verbally and/or physically abused by people purporting to be Philadelphia sports fans.</p>
        <p>After my family's horrible experience on April 10 at the Phillies' home opening game, letters to and responses from the Philadelphia Phillies and the baseball commissioner Bud Selig, it is obvious this climate of danger is not only accepted in Philadelphia, but also fostered.</p>
        <p>In the wake of international terrorism, United States airlines feel obligated to protect their passengers. Since Major League Baseball, the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania are unconcerned about the safety of fans attending events at their venues, it is our team's obligation to warn us of fans' terroristic activities in cities like Philadelphia.</p>
