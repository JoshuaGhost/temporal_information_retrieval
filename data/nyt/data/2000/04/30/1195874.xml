        <p>To the Editor: I feel compelled to write after reading ''It's a Jungle Out There,'' by Gretchen Schoenhof, (Feb. 13) on the Amazon and the Ariau Amazon Towers Hotel. We stayed there a year ago and had an entirely different reaction.</p>
        <p>After our three-hour boat ride along the Amazon, we arrived at the tower. We had arranged to be picked up at a dock in Manaus by an English-speaking guide. We were way above the ground, but secure. We were warned not to be frightened if monkeys jumped on our shoulders as we walked along the bridge, that they just wanted to play.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: I feel compelled to write after reading ''It's a Jungle Out There,'' by Gretchen Schoenhof, (Feb. 13) on the Amazon and the Ariau Amazon Towers Hotel. We stayed there a year ago and had an entirely different reaction.</p>
        <p>After our three-hour boat ride along the Amazon, we arrived at the tower. We had arranged to be picked up at a dock in Manaus by an English-speaking guide. We were way above the ground, but secure. We were warned not to be frightened if monkeys jumped on our shoulders as we walked along the bridge, that they just wanted to play.</p>
        <p>The Brazilian who owned the place had a generator, so we did have electricity. We went out on a starlit night in a canoe looking for alligators and with our guide's help, found a few. We walked through the jungle, got rained on in the rain forest -- but in no time, the sun came out. Our guide took us fishing for piranhas, which we tasted at lunch.</p>
        <p>Generally, our three-day adventure there was one of the best my husband and I have ever experienced.</p>
