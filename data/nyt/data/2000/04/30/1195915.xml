        <p>Yale University Assistant Prof John Halle letter on Matthias Kreisberg's April 16 article advocating serialist tradition in music; says belief is undercut by his failure to name single work of this soon-to-be century-old practice that has kind of secure place in the concert hall that its adherents were predicting</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Matthias Kreisberg's articulate advocacy for the serialist tradition [''The Musical God That Failed? Says Who?'' April 16] is undercut by his failure to name a single work of this soon-to-be century-old practice that has the kind of secure place in the concert hall that its adherents were predicting. While the absence is revealing, however, it should not be overstated: that dodecaphonic works will occupy an important, but nonetheless indisputably peripheral, region around a center dominated by nonserial -- indeed, largely tonal -- 20th-century works by Bartok, Stravinsky, Sibelius, Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Strauss and others only means that some serialists were great composers but lousy prophets.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Matthias Kreisberg's articulate advocacy for the serialist tradition [''The Musical God That Failed? Says Who?'' April 16] is undercut by his failure to name a single work of this soon-to-be century-old practice that has the kind of secure place in the concert hall that its adherents were predicting. While the absence is revealing, however, it should not be overstated: that dodecaphonic works will occupy an important, but nonetheless indisputably peripheral, region around a center dominated by nonserial -- indeed, largely tonal -- 20th-century works by Bartok, Stravinsky, Sibelius, Ravel, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Strauss and others only means that some serialists were great composers but lousy prophets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kreisberg also (not surprisingly) categorically rejects the by now uncontroversial comparison of serialist orthodoxy in the academy with Stalinism. Most of those who lived through the period find the comparison of the intellectual atmosphere of each more than a little apt. That being said, I must register my agreement with his equation of the facile neo-Romanticism that began to dominate establishment musical institutions about two decades ago, and the Reaganite supply-side ideology that arose concurrently.</p>
        <p>It is worth pushing these analogies a little further. Recent history has revealed, to our great distress, that the social ruthlessness, brutality and decadence of the unbridled free market in present-day Russia has offered, on balance, few advantages over the harsh command-economy police state that preceded it. I don't believe it is overly dramatic to suggest that the nonmusical future there and, possibly, the musical future here may depend on our finding a viable third way.</p>
