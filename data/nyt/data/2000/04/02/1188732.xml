        <p>Homeowners along Wilkinson Avenue in Morris Park section of the Bronx consider asking New York City to 'demap' their street, to get rid of rowdy intruders who congregate on quiet street at night; photo; map (S)</p>

        <p>Every morning before breakfast, Charles Lieberman gets up, walks outside armed with a rake and a garbage bag, and cleans up the broken beer bottles and used condoms on the sidewalk along his house on Wilkinson Avenue.</p>
        <p>The routine has hardly varied for more than 40 years, as the little street, nestled between Seminole Avenue and Bronx Municipal Hospital, has been a popular hangout spot for young people.</p>
        <p>But changing times have brought a  rougher crowd to the quiet, 50-foot dead-end street. Now, homeowners along Wilkinson Avenue want something done about the nightly revelries and the debris left behind.</p>
        <p>''It's gotten so bad that I think about moving,'' said one homeowner.  ''It's like a motel alley. They wake me up at all hours, litter on my property. It's a sin. I used to have a beautiful garden, but I can't keep it up anymore.''</p>
        <p>Some community leaders are proposing a novel solution: removing the street from city maps.</p>
        <p>The idea behind ''demapping'' is to wrest the property from a city that, the homeowners believe, cannot maintain or police it, said John Fratta, the plan's author and the  district manager of Community Board 11.</p>
        <p>If the street is no longer mapped, then city services, like sanitation, would no longer be provided. The property essentially becomes a city-owned lot, which the homeowners could then seek to buy from the city. If the city agrees, the homeowners could cordon off the street or otherwise protect it.</p>
        <p>''We'd like to install a light there, too,'' Mr. Fratta said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the community board has asked the police for help, and officers of the 49th Precinct have  increased surveillance of the street.</p>
        <p>At the request of State Senator Guy J. Velella, the city has also recently installed ''No Dumping'' signs on the road and increased street cleanings by the Sanitation Department.</p>
        <p>But the homeowners say that while those efforts are appreciated, only constant surveillance would solve the problem if the street remains mapped.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to buy the lot,'' Mr. Lieberman said. ''Then we could fence it off. The neighbors would all like that.'' He added that safety also now concerns him, saying that some of the revelers are more belligerent than those who gathered when he bought his house in 1958.</p>
        <p>Demapping is not unprecedented. It was done 16 times in 1999, for reasons as varied as the needs of a new construction project to the discovery that a street ran through private property. But demapping is a complicated process, said Jennifer Chait, a spokeswoman for the City Planning Commission.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, homeowners on Wilkinson Avenue say they would like to give the demapping solution a try.</p>
        <p>''What else can you do?'' Mr. Lieberman said.</p>
        <p>''I've taken to throwing the broken glass on the street to give them flats,'' he said. ''Let them complain about something for a change.''</p>
