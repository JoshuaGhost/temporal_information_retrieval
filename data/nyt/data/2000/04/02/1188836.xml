        <p>After Michelle Kwan finished third in the short program at the figure skating world championships on Friday, a sympathetic fan told her, ''I wish the Russians would fall, just for you.''</p>
        <p>Kwan told her supporter to hope for something constructive. ''Wish for me to skate well,'' she said. The fan agreed.</p>
        <p>If that fan watched today as Kwan leapt and spun with uncommon resolve and then took the top place on the medal stand, she would know it all had gone exactly as Kwan had hoped.</p>
        <p>Though her Russian rivals Irina Slutskaya and Mariya Butyrskaya did falter, they did not fall, and Kwan skated as well as she had ever skated to win her third and most unexpected world title. It is a championship that put an abrupt end to any suggestions that she might be in inexorable decline.</p>
        <p>''My dad always laughs at me, and says I have to be up against the wall to fight back,'' said Kwan, who on the medal stand had tears in her eyes. ''He always says, 'Why don't you fight back before?' It's true, and I think after the short program it was clear that I have to do what I say.''</p>
        <p>What Kwan had been saying for much of the last two rather unsatisfactory seasons was that she had to take bigger risks in her programs. According to her coach, Frank Carroll, Kwan has never performed two more technically demanding programs back to back than she did here in Nice. In Friday's short program, she inserted the trickier triple flip for a triple toe loop and had only a slight bobble on one landing. Today she landed six triple jumps with style in the first two minutes of her free program and finished with a total of seven, including a triple toe-triple toe combination that turned out to be the afternoon's only clean triple-triple.</p>
        <p>''To me, she's the best skater in the world; it's really up to her,'' Carroll said. ''I think she's learned more and more that you can't hold back and achieve anything.''</p>
        <p>Slutskaya, the European champion, ended up with the silver medal, and Butyrskaya, the defending world champion, the bronze. Sarah Hughes, a 14-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., finished fifth, two spots better than in her world championships debut last year. ''I feel like I have arrived,'' Hughes said.</p>
        <p>Kwan's free program was a blend of eye-catching technical difficulty and fluid moves set to a subdued, reflective piece from the soundtrack to ''The Red Violin,'' which never left the French fans much room to express their enthusiasm until the final strains had faded and the broadest of grins had spread across Kwan's face. The judges were impressed but not overwhelmed, giving her marks ranging from 5.6 to 5.8 for technical merit and 5.8's and 5.9's for presentation. They had left some narrow passing lanes for Butyrskaya and Slutskaya, who had finished first and second, respectively, in the short program.</p>
        <p>But Kwan told herself: ''Michelle, you skated the best program of your life. Whatever happens, be happy.''</p>
        <p>Butyrskaya went first, landing her first two triple jumps but then failing to complete her combination and downgrading a triple salchow to a double. And though her presentation marks are typically her strength, Kwan beat her there, as well.</p>
        <p>Butyrskaya could still have won the gold by finishing second to Kwan in the free program. In order for Kwan to win, she needed Butyrskaya to drop to third, which was exactly what happened after Slutskaya skated well enough to beat her teammate but not aggressively or cleanly enough to beat Kwan.</p>
        <p>In January, Slutskaya defeated Kwan at the Grand Prix final by becoming the first woman to land two triple-triple combinations in the same program. Today she could not land one, and though the Ukrainian and Croatian judges still placed her first, the other seven judges saw it Kwan's way.</p>
        <p>Many champions dominate for a stretch and then fade from prominence. But Kwan's career has been less linear. She won her first world title in 1996 and lost to Tara Lipinski in 1997 and at the 1998 Winter Olympics. She regained her world title later in 1998, only to lose it again last year when Butyrskaya became the oldest women's champion in history at 26.</p>
        <p>Now, less than a year after leaving the familiar cocoon of her training center in Lake Arrowhead, Calif., and enrolling at U.C.L.A., the 19-year-old Kwan is back on top again.</p>
        <p>''What happened to the odd years?'' Kwan said today with a laugh before putting this title, her most unexpected title, in perspective. ''I think this is the most satisfying championship for me,'' she said. ''There was a lot of pressure from outside: 'You've got to do triple-triple; got to do this; got to up the ante.' ''</p>
        <p>For much of the fall, she and Carroll struggled to train consistently or well, but they are firmly re-established at a rink near Los Angeles. Their goal remains a gold medal at the 2002 Olympics, and Carroll made it clear today that though he supports Kwan's academic career, he hopes she will put school on hold in the Olympic year, which happens to be an even year.</p>
        <p>''That's good,'' Kwan said.</p>
