        <p>This sort of thinking is reminiscent of the ''old age'' values that supported our society's throwaway mentality and its view that it was convenient and natural to use the earth as a receptacle for our unwanted goods. I would have preferred to see more earth-friendly suggestions, such as rinsing out the shirts, giving them away or taking them home.</p>
