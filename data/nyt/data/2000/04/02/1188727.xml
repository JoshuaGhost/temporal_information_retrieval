        <p>In February, most of the roughly 150 dealers renting space in the Chelsea Antiques Building at 110 West 25th Street were told by the landlord to vacate the building by April 29, when the building would close.</p>
        <p>By now, many tenants of the 12-story building, which housed the largest indoor flea market for antiques in the city, have already moved out, because most leases allow termination with 60 days' notice.</p>
        <p>But several vendors with no such clauses and with years left on their leases are refusing to go.</p>
        <p>They say, however, that Dezer Properties, which owns the building, has already stopped putting out sidewalk store signs and no longer pays a weekend doorman to greet customers. As a result, the vendors say, business has declined.</p>
        <p>''I've paid my rent through May and have a lease through 2002, and they're already shutting the place down,'' said Lonnie Coffman, who owns New York Galleries. He opened his store in 1997 and signed a three-year lease last November, he said, paying more than $2,000 a month for his second-floor space.</p>
        <p>''I've built a steady following of foreign clients,'' he said. ''How will they find me if I'm suddenly forced to move?''</p>
        <p>Richard Maurer, the manager, said the building's owner would keep its own consignment gallery open on the ground floor and renovate the upper floors. He would not say what those floors would be used for.</p>
        <p>Dezer bought the building in 1992 and rented largely to vendors from the nearby outdoor flea markets, helping many to move on to larger stores, he said, adding, ''We've kept most rents the same all these years, despite rising expenses.''</p>
        <p>Most vendors have easily rented space in buildings close by, he said, adding that Dezer would help tenants like Mr. Coffman find space in other buildings it owns nearby.</p>
        <p>Development is pushing out other local dealers in this antiques district. Much of the Avenue of the Americas  and Seventh Avenues in the West 20's was rezoned last year from manufacturing to a zone allowing larger residential buildings, several of which are being built on lots long used for weekend flea markets for antiques. Soaring local rents also fuel the conversion, with Wall Street and Silicon Alley companies paying in the millions for full-floor spaces.</p>
        <p>''They're not evicting us, but they're making it impossible for us to stay,'' said Julian Benfield, who owns Julian's Books, a store with  30,000 rare and antique volumes. ''You just can't pick up a store like this and move with two months' notice.''</p>
