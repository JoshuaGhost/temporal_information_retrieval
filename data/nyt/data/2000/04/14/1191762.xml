        <p>Even as the South Carolina Senate gave its overwhelming final approval to a compromise plan that would remove the Confederate battle flag from the State Capitol's dome, the bill ran into heated opposition today from black members of the state's House of Representatives, who said the flag's location in front of the building would be no less an affront to black citizens.</p>
        <p>The flag issue has exposed a deep rift between black senators -- six of seven voted for the bill -- and black House members, who represent smaller districts and tend to be less inclined to compromise. One legislator said that 24 of the 26 black representatives were opposed to this compromise and that many would actually prefer to keep the flag on the dome rather than move it out front. The House is likely to vote in the next two or three weeks on the bill, which cleared the Senate by 36 to 7 on Wednesday and by the same tally in one last, technical vote today.</p>

        <p>Even as the South Carolina Senate gave its overwhelming final approval to a compromise plan that would remove the Confederate battle flag from the State Capitol's dome, the bill ran into heated opposition today from black members of the state's House of Representatives, who said the flag's location in front of the building would be no less an affront to black citizens.</p>
        <p>The flag issue has exposed a deep rift between black senators -- six of seven voted for the bill -- and black House members, who represent smaller districts and tend to be less inclined to compromise. One legislator said that 24 of the 26 black representatives were opposed to this compromise and that many would actually prefer to keep the flag on the dome rather than move it out front. The House is likely to vote in the next two or three weeks on the bill, which cleared the Senate by 36 to 7 on Wednesday and by the same tally in one last, technical vote today.</p>
        <p>In addition, the N.A.A.C.P., which is engaged in an economic boycott of the state because of the flag's display, said today that the boycott would continue if it was moved to the front of the Capitol. James Gallman, president of the group's South Carolina chapter, said a flag in front of a public building conveyed the same sense of sovereignty as a flag above it.</p>
        <p>Several state officials said privately that they expected the bill to pass the House with the approval of most black members, after some initial resistance intended largely to satisfy the black lawmakers' constituents. The legislation's chances will improve, these officials said, when members realize that it is the only way to get the flag off the dome. In fact, the speaker of the Republican-controlled House, David H. Wilkins,  an avid flag supporter, said today that the Senate compromise was the only plan he would allow to pass.</p>
        <p>Under that plan, the rectangular Confederate flag would be removed from the dome and from the two legislative chambers. A smaller, square version of the flag, similar to the one carried by Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, would be placed on a 20-foot flagpole in front of the Capitol, adjacent to a 33-foot-high memorial to the state's Confederate soldiers.</p>
        <p>Atop the dome, the flag can be seen throughout the city, but it is so high  that it is actually hard to see on the Capitol grounds. Its position closer to eye level near the main entrance to the Capitol, several black representatives argued, would make it more prominent to anyone passing by.</p>
        <p>''It's right in your face,'' said Representative J. Todd Rutherford, a black Democrat from Columbia. ''Any rally or march or protest at the Statehouse will have to take place directly under that flag. It's not the proper place for it, and I'd rather leave it up on the dome than put it there.''</p>
        <p>Although one black senator has said he voted for the plan because the flag would be smaller, that argument did not seem to carry much weight among blacks in the House.</p>
        <p>''Would you ask the Jewish community to accept a smaller swastika flag?'' said Representative Fletcher N. Smith, a black Democrat from  Greenville. ''This is the flag of treason against the United States government, and it should not be celebrated or put in any kind of prominent position.''</p>
        <p>But Darrell Jackson, the Senate's leading black opponent of the flag,  said the proposal, distasteful though  it was to him, was the best compromise that could be struck.</p>
        <p>''At the end of the day, this will pass,'' said Mr. Jackson, a life member of the N.A.A.C.P. ''This gets rid of three flags in positions of sovereignty, and replaces them with one. My colleagues in the House will have to realize they can accept the compromise or maintain the status quo. And if we adjourn and leave the flag up there on the dome, they will have to answer to themselves and their constituents.''</p>
        <p>The bill could pass the 124-member House without any black votes, but the majority leader, Representative Richard M. Quinn Jr. of Columbia, said today that the Republicans would not support it without being joined by a substantial number of Democrats.</p>
        <p>The issue has festered in South Carolina since legislators first unfurled the flag in 1962 as part of the centennial observance of the Civil War. Later the state kept it flying in defiance of the civil rights movement. This year, after the boycott made it a national issue that reached even into the presidential campaign,  lawmakers have been under tremendous pressure from business and political leaders around the state to adopt any kind of compromise that would get the flag off the dome. The South Carolina Chamber of Commerce, for example, has said it does not care where the flag goes, as long as it does not fly from the Capitol.</p>
        <p>Several House members suggested today that the pressure for a compromise had led the Senate to be too generous to flag supporters, whose standard would be the only one flying in front of the Capitol. (Atop the dome, it flies with both the American flag and the state flag.)  But even critics said they could understand such an accommodation, given the fiercely held belief among many white lawmakers that the flag is a noble symbol of their families' Southern heritage.</p>
        <p>Representative Curtis B. Inabinett, a black member from the coastal town of Ravenel, noted that he reluctantly voted on Wednesday for a bill creating a state holiday to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., making South Carolina the last state  to do so. His reluctance, he said, resulted from a provision, attached by white lawmakers, that would also create a Confederate Memorial holiday.</p>
        <p>''That was the hardest vote I ever cast, but it was that or nothing,'' Mr. Inabinett said. ''And if it turns out this is the best we can do on the flag, well, then, I suspect a lot of us will turn around and vote for it.''</p>
