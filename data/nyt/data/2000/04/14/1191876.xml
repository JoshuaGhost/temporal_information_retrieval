        <p>'Strange Moments'</p>
        <p>Howard Greenberg Gallery</p>
        <p>120 Wooster Street</p>
        <p>SoHo</p>
        <p>Through April 22</p>
        <p>Diane Arbus is a hard act to follow. The standards she set for straightforward portraiture of a certain kind -- psychological, private, permanent -- are so high that photographers who venture into that territory run the risk of having their work found wanting. In  ''Strange Moments,'' Mary Ellen Mark's Arbus-like photographs invite that kind of comparison, and they fall short.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mark is known for making humanist concerns a central part of her work, but in these pictures, taken mostly in the 1990's, that concern isn't always apparent. Many of her subjects are Arbus subjects -- people masked or unmasked who might seem unusual or bizarre to the average person. But where Arbus showed a wry sense of humor and a belief in the lonely courage of being different or just being alive, Ms. Mark's photographs here seem voyeuristic, even cold.</p>

        <p>Diane Arbus is a hard act to follow.

In  ''Strange Moments,'' Mary Ellen Mark's Arbus-like photographs invite that kind of comparison, and they fall short.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mark is known for making humanist concerns a central part of her work, but in these pictures, taken mostly in the 1990's, that concern isn't always apparent. Many of her subjects are Arbus subjects -- people masked or unmasked who might seem unusual or bizarre to the average person. But where Arbus showed a wry sense of humor and a belief in the lonely courage of being different or just being alive, Ms. Mark's photographs here seem voyeuristic, even cold.</p>
        <p>A hydrocephalic girl in Italy sits in her chair, her face turned away, while her sister, standing, looks somberly at the photographer, as if  questioning the camera's intrusion. There's more that looks wincingly intrusive. Usman the Clown in Bombay, who is a dwarf, lies affectionately beside his baby son. With his lower face in white paint, Usman is shown as a disturbing oddity.</p>
        <p>Some of the images are uncomfortably derivative. An elderly couple sit on their sofa, three ceramic dolls on the wall behind them, the busily patterned floor and wallpaper providing lots of visual noise. Two dwarfs, twin brothers in a Calcutta circus, pose: one holds his gorilla mask; the other, mask on, holds a small dog.</p>
        <p>When she isn't trying to be Arbus, Ms. Mark can create beautiful images. In ''Tashara and Tanesha Reese, Twins Festival, Twinsburg, Ohio,'' she catches a timeless moment of childhood: two children playing house. Surrounded by household rejects, including a broken computer on a metal stand, the girl fiddles with a grill while the boy sits in a lawn chair, a phone handset to one ear, deep in a conversation of his own imagining.</p>
