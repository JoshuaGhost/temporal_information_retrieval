      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The singer and pianist Steve Ross is such a master at putting a debonair spin on Cole Porter and Noel Coward's musical high jinks that his persona is that of a sophisticated party entertainer who holds off the blues with a froth of wit. But there is an introspective side to Mr. Ross that has increasingly peeked out in his recent cabaret performances.</p>
        <p>That side is shy, dreamy and wryly self-knowing. And in his wonderful new show, ''Love and Laughter, Part 1,'' which opened an eight-week engagement at the Firebird Cafe on Wednesday, the humor is balanced by songs that have the feel of wistful sighs.</p>

        <p>The singer and pianist Steve Ross is such a master at putting a debonair spin on Cole Porter and Noel Coward's musical high jinks that his persona is that of a sophisticated party entertainer who holds off the blues with a froth of wit. But there is an introspective side to Mr. Ross that has increasingly peeked out in his recent cabaret performances.</p>
        <p>That side is shy, dreamy and wryly self-knowing. And in his wonderful new show, ''Love and Laughter, Part 1,'' which opened an eight-week engagement at the Firebird Cafe on Wednesday, the humor is balanced by songs that have the feel of wistful sighs.</p>
        <p>For every two moments of delicious fun (Porter's hilarious list song of mythic sexual conquests, ''They Couldn't Compare to You,'' from ''Out of This World'' is a particular highlight) there is one of sobriety. Mr. Ross's version of ''I Can Dream, Can't I?'' finds a core of truth in a ballad that nobody else has uncovered. In his quiet, resigned interpretation, the narrator who tells an absent sweetheart, ''I'm aware my heart is a sad affair'' isn't just putting on dramatic airs. The song becomes the confession of a man who is so wounded he can love only at a distance, in fantasy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross imparts a similar resonance to Porter's ''All Through the Night.''</p>
        <p>The narrator is an obsessive fantasist who prefers his nocturnal visions to daytime reality. ''One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)'' also undergoes a striking transformation, from a loudmouthed barfly's tale of romantic woe to the monologue of someone so stunned by disappointment he can barely put words together.</p>
        <p>This is not to say the show isn't fun. The sad songs make the laughter brighter by revealing how merriment can camouflage the diffidence of a wounded dreamer.</p>
