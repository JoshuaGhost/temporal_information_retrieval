        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You say (editorial, April 16) that the tax system in the United States is in danger of being subverted, and you conclude that this subversion is due to Congress's weakening of the enforcement arm of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>I would suggest that the principal reason that tax returns are inaccurate is the complex and convoluted nature of the tax code.</p>

        <p>You say (editorial, April 16) that the tax system in the United States is in danger of being subverted, and you conclude that this subversion is due to Congress's weakening of the enforcement arm of the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>I would suggest that the principal reason that tax returns are inaccurate is the complex and convoluted nature of the tax code.</p>
        <p>When half a dozen accountants can arrive at as many different interpretations; when the I.R.S. itself is unable to provide consistent advice regarding the same question; and when a sample return is often too confusing for an average person to prepare without assistance, the taxpayer loses all hope of accurate compliance.</p>
        <p>If it is impossible for the umpires to understand the rules, the players cannot be faulted for interpreting them in their favor and playing the game accordingly.</p>
