        <p>Editorial on disclosures about Central Intelligence Agency meddling in Iran holds both United States and Iran must face history honestly</p>

        <p>If the United States and Iran are ever to restore good relations, both nations must understand the events that helped drive them apart. That history begins with the 1953 coup orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency that restored a reluctant Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi to power. The shah helped modernize his country and kept it firmly allied with Washington. But his harsh American-backed dictatorship suppressed dissent and stunted the development of democratic politics.</p>
        <p>A report in The Times on Sunday by James Risen provided the most extensive account yet of how that coup unfolded, based on portions of a long-secret C.I.A. history. It reveals how the agency's initial plans badly misfired and how some military officers and conservative religious leaders recruited by the C.I.A. toppled the secular leftist government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.</p>

        <p>If the United States and Iran are ever to restore good relations, both nations must understand the events that helped drive them apart. That history begins with the 1953 coup orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency that restored a reluctant Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi to power. The shah helped modernize his country and kept it firmly allied with Washington. But his harsh American-backed dictatorship suppressed dissent and stunted the development of democratic politics.</p>
        <p>A report in The Times on Sunday by James Risen provided the most extensive account yet of how that coup unfolded, based on portions of a long-secret C.I.A. history. It reveals how the agency's initial plans badly misfired and how some military officers and conservative religious leaders recruited by the C.I.A. toppled the secular leftist government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh.</p>
        <p>Those disclosures raise tantalizing questions. For example, what role, if any, might some of the religious militants employed by the C.I.A. in 1953 have gone on to play in Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979? The C.I.A. reports that some of its records on the Iranian events have been destroyed. But much of what remains should be promptly declassified.</p>
        <p>Washington had legitimate security concerns about Iran, a strategically important oil country bordering the Soviet Union. It had understandable misgivings about the Mossadegh government, which had nationalized Iran's oil industry and was supported by the country's increasingly powerful Communist Party. Yet the C.I.A.'s meddling in internal Iranian politics was wrong and had negative long-term consequences for the United States.</p>
        <p>The repressive rule of the shah helped turn Iranians away from their traditionally pro-American views. The subsequent weakness of secular reform politicians made it that much easier for conservative religious militants, with their anti-American slogans, to consolidate power after the 1979 revolution. Even today, Iran's few remaining secular democratic leaders remain marginalized.</p>
        <p>Iranians, for their part, must come to terms with the 444-day captivity of the hostages seized by Islamic militants in 1979 at the United States Embassy in Tehran. President Mohammad Khatami, to his credit, has expressed regret for the embassy seizure. But Iran's top religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still hails the hostage-taking as a great national victory. Nor have Iranian authorities ever acknowledged Iran's assistance to terrorist groups that target Americans, among others. It is not easy to face history honestly, but both Washington and Tehran must do so.</p>
