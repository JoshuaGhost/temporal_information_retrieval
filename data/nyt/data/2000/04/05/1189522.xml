        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the Legislature agreed today on the outlines of a roughly $77 billion spending plan that generously finances education, health care, transportation and tax cuts, clearing the way for one of the earliest budgets in a decade.</p>

        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki and leaders of the Legislature agreed today on the outlines of a roughly $77 billion spending plan that generously finances education, health care, transportation and tax cuts, clearing the way for one of the earliest budgets in a decade.</p>
        <p>With the state running a large surplus, the accord sets the boundaries for a budget that is all but certain to include an array of programs that the governor did not call for in his original budget proposal -- from expansion of prekindergarten classes and reductions in class size to low-cost prescription drugs for the elderly. And state leaders also agreed to let voters decide in November whether to spend money on a host of transportation projects, including a new Second Avenue subway line.</p>
        <p>The deal calls for spending $1.4 billion more than the governor proposed in January. It propels the budget talks further along than they have been at this date in most recent years, and it places Mr. Pataki and the Legislature on a course to enact a final budget by the end of the month.</p>
        <p>The deal also calls for $1.2 billion in new tax cuts. But the cuts are not expected to have a significant impact on this year's final budget because they will be structured to take effect in future budget years, legislative aides said.</p>
        <p>The agreement frees Governor Pataki from dealing with business in Albany and allows him to turn his attention to campaigning for Gov. George W. Bush and in the process possibly secure a place in a Bush administration for himself.</p>
        <p>The budget was due on April 1, but for the 16th consecutive year, the governor and the Legislature failed to meet that deadline. Last year's budget was adopted on Aug. 4 -- 126 days overdue. With today's agreement, the action shifts to the Legislature, where rank-and-file members of both houses will have to negotiate the final details publicly in conference committees.</p>
        <p>The swiftness of the budget negotiations this year has been propelled by the legislators' desire to get home early to campaign for re-election, and by a continued surge in tax revenue that allows lawmakers to avoid having to make many of the hard choices of the past. It has also helped that Medicaid spending, traditionally one of the most contentious areas of the budget, was determined in a separate agreement in December.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers and their leaders faced another incentive for a timely budget: a one-year-old law that withholds their pay for as long as the budget is late.</p>
        <p>Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the Senate, predicted today that the budget, the main business of Albany, would be completed in slightly over a week. ''Today we have come together and resolved the differences that have separated us these last few weeks on a budget that will ultimately provide investments in education, transportation and other essential needs,'' he said in a statement.</p>
        <p>The accord announced today calls for $1.2 billion in new tax cuts to be phased in over the next five years, including tax credits for low-wage New Yorkers, as well as a reduction of a tax that adds several dollars a month to the average utility bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders also agreed to place a $3.8 billion bond act on the November ballot that would help, among other things, to pay for a new Second Avenue subway line -- demanded by the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver -- as well as repairs to highways and bridges upstate and in the New York City suburbs, a demand made in turn by Mr. Bruno and his Republican colleagues.</p>
        <p>The agreement also adds $750 million in a reserve fund to hedge against an economic downturn and to make up for revenue lost to future tax cuts that the governor and the Legislature had enacted in previous years. Mr. Pataki had insisted that the money be placed in reserve.</p>
        <p>In the past, agreement on how much to spend above the governor's proposal has been the most difficult part of the budget negotiations. But with tax revenue streaming in, it was hard for Mr. Pataki to resist the Legislature's call for more spending. Mr. Pataki had proposed spending $76.8 billion in the budget he released earlier this year. But lawmakers said he had overestimated the cost of some programs, so that the $1.4 billion of new spending in the budget accord would actually raise total spending by a lesser amount.</p>
        <p>As part of the deal, Mr. Pataki has promised that he will not attempt the sort of widespread vetoes he made in 1998, when he cut more than $1 billion in programs, mostly Democratic, from the budget lawmakers sent him. But Mr. Pataki has privately warned Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver that he will abide by the deal only if  they do not spend any more than the $1.4 billion that they agreed to add to his original budget proposal.</p>
        <p>The deal reached today by Mr. Pataki, Mr. Bruno and Mr. Silver settles the main issue that had held up negotiations for weeks: an overall spending figure that all sides could accept. But aides to Mr. Pataki and legislative leaders cautioned that some details still had to be worked out before the budget was completed and then submitted to lawmakers for approval. Conference committee hearings to consider the budget will start as early as Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The additional spending that Mr. Pataki, a Republican, and the leaders agreed upon for the 2000-2001 fiscal year will largely finance programs that both houses of the Legislature have been seeking in recent months. In that respect, the deal allows all sides to claim victory.</p>
        <p>The governor and legislative leaders tentatively agreed that some of the new money would finance a program that Democrats who control the Assembly had sought: expanding prekindergarten classes statewide and reducing classroom size over the next few years.</p>
        <p>The deal also calls for setting aside part of the additional money for a program that is strongly supported by the Republicans who control the Senate: expanding a state subsidy of prescription drug purchases for elderly New Yorkers, along with expanded tuition assistance for college students and their families.</p>
        <p>While the deal calls for spending significantly more than Mr. Pataki had proposed, it allows him to achieve one of his main objectives this year: saving $750 million to help balance the budget in future years, particularly if the economy slows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki and the leaders agreed to set aside roughly $950 million for several tax cuts that rank-and-file members will specify. But aides to the governor and legislative leaders said that much of that money would be used to scale back the so-called gross receipts tax, which adds several dollars a month on average to New Yorkers' utility bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki and the leaders also agreed to earmark $125 million to expand the earned-income tax credit, a break to the working poor. The deal also calls for setting aside at least $120 million to provide tax credits to businesses with high utility costs, according to aides to the three leaders. But Republicans said they would also push for a plan to make college education fully deductible as part of a final agreement.</p>
        <p>The deal to provide $3.8 billion for transportation projects will not have an impact on this year's budget either. That is because leaders plan to ask voters in November to let the state borrow the money by issuing bonds. The last time such a measure went before voters was in 1997, when state leaders put a $2.4 billion school construction bond act on the ballot. The measure was defeated.</p>
        <p>One crucial part of the budget that has not been decided is how much will be spent on school aid. But legislative aides say they expect that the budget will increase overall aid to school districts by at least $1 billion, which would be largest annual increase ever for education spending.</p>
        <p>HIGHLIGHTS  Proposed State Budget: Few Sacrifices</p>
        <p>Legislative leaders in Albany have agreed to spend $1.4 billion more than what was proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki, though that is offset somewhat by reducing the governor's estimates of what some programs will cost. In all, they estimate that the final budget will be $77 billion to $78 billion, an increase of 5 to 6 percent over last year.</p>
        <p>EDUCATION -- Legislative leaders said the state would increase school aid $900 million to $1.2 billion over last year, with the exact figure to be negotiated in conference committees. The state would continue the planned expansion of its program to provide prekindergarten classes to all 4-year-olds, and to reduce class sizes in the early grades, at a cost of $190 million.</p>
        <p>TAXES -- Officials agreed to tax cuts that, when fully enacted in a few years, would be worth more than $1 billion -- the exact figure has not been decided -- but would most likely be worth a small fraction of that in the first year. Most elements of the tax cut package still must be negotiated, but the lawmakers have agreed to expand the earned income tax credit for the working poor by $125 million a year, matching the increase enacted last year. One issue still undecided is whether to reduce or eliminate what amounts to an income tax on electrical utilities, one that raises power rates. The budget also reflects $2.3 billion worth of tax cuts enacted in past years that will take effect this year.</p>
        <p>HEALTH CARE -- State leaders remain undecided about two contentious items sought by the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno. Mr. Bruno wants to expand the program that subsidizes prescription drugs for the elderly poor, and to have the state pay for all of a new effort to provide health coverage for the uninsured, rather than pass on part of the cost to local governments. Officials say the lawmakers are likely to accept the prescription drug subsidy, but insist on passing on some new costs to cities and counties.</p>
        <p>TRANSPORTATION -- The lawmakers agreed that apart from the budget, they would approve two $17 billion capital plans, one for mass transit and one for highways and bridges, with a $3.8 billion bond act going before the voters in November to help pay for them. As part of that deal, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority will plan for a Second Avenue subway line the full length of Manhattan, rather than from 125th Street to 63rd Street, as the M.T.A. had proposed in its capital plan.</p>
