        <p>CONSIDERING the setting for the following interview a big, bustling gun factory in Brooklyn -- what comes next may be hard to believe. But Anthony F. Imperato and his family have never really been all that crazy about guns.</p>
        <p>''Guns were just not a part of our lives,'' he said. ''Other than the fact that we sold them.''</p>
        <p>These days, the business that supports the Imperato family seems about as out of place in New York City as a kosher deli would be in West Texas: The family owns both the gun factory, the only such factory in the city, and a gun shop, the oldest in the city, in Little Italy.</p>
        <p>But growing up in Bensonhurt, Mr. Imperato said, he and his father, Louis, never once went hunting. ''We didn't shoot at targets. None of our hobbies ever involved guns. Guns were a job.'' He reaches for an apt analogy: ''Maybe the guys who run Lobel's meat market are, you know, vegetarians. You never know.''</p>
        <p>So over the last several years, as New York's gun laws have become among the most restrictive in the country, and especially over the last several weeks, as the national debate over gun control has grown even more polarized, Mr. Imperato, 42, has become a man in a strange spot.</p>
        <p>When the workday is over, he would much rather talk about food than firearms. In a three-hour interview that started on a desolate industrial street near the Gowanus Canal, continued through the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and ended in Little Italy, he did not once mention the Second Amendment. But he is a member of the National Rifle Association. And he is a businessman -- ''a very responsible businessman,'' he said -- who has watched his livelihood come under assault even though he feels he has never done anything wrong.</p>
        <p>''My viewpoint on the right of people to own guns is the same as it has always been,'' he says. ''But like anything else, the more you're attacked, the more you think about whether to fight or flee.''</p>
        <p>''And we're not going to flee,'' he adds resolutely. But the family is certainly finding it more difficult to hold its ground.</p>
        <p>The Imperatos' storied Manhattan gun shop, with its famous wooden pistol sign aiming due west, has seen better days. Called John Jovino after its founder, a former Italian leather smith who moved the shop to its address on Centre Market Place in 1911, it was once in the middle of a block of busy gun shops that catered mostly to the gun-toting men who worked across the street, at the old Police Headquarters.</p>
        <p>''When I would go there as a kid with my father,'' Mr. Imperato recalled, ''it was a sea of blue. It smelled like holster leather.''</p>
        <p>HE got into the business without thinking much about it. He grew up wanting to play either center field for the Yankees or the piano for Bruce Springsteen, ''but somehow that didn't happen.'' He studied business at New York University, thinking vaguely about the restaurant trade because he had always been something of a gourmet.</p>
        <p>But then his family gave him an apartment above the gun shop, where he lived from the late 1970's to early 1980's. And so, he said, smiling broadly and quoting from a character in ''The Sopranos'' who was quoting Al Pacino in ''The Godfather, Part III,'' ''Just when I thought that I was out, they p-u-l-l me back in.''</p>
        <p>But by the time Mr. Imperato got into the business, it was a different world on Centre Market Place. The police moved south in 1973. The city's gun laws gradually became tougher, requiring buyers to wait anywhere from six to nine months for a permit. And mostly for the first reason, but also for the second, said Mr. Imperato (pronounced Im-per-AH-to), he and his father, who is now semi-retired, were looking for a way to stay afloat by the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>They ended up looking into the past. In 1993, hoping to capitalize on the growing interest in Civil War memorabilia, they opened the Brooklyn factory, which now makes newly issued Colt pistols and cap-and-ball revolvers, first manufactured in the mid-1800's, along with reproductions of Henry rifles, first used in the Civil War. (Henry's motto: ''Load on Sunday and shoot all week long!'')</p>
        <p>The powder guns made do not require a permit, luckily. Like the modern guns beneath the glass case in the store, they can still be used to kill someone, of course. But the shooter first must learn a whole lot about black powder, percussion caps, wadding, lead balls and hand-strengthening exercises. ''The revolvers have a pretty good kick,'' he explains.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. Imperato spends most of his time at the factory, which cranks out about 5,000 guns a year. ''This is where we put the butter on the bread now, is right here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He speaks of trying to keep the Manhattan store open at least until its centennial, in honor of his grandfather, Frank Albanese, who bought it from Mr. Jovino. But these days the store is mostly in the hands of its manager, a friendly Chinese man who is known around the neighborhood simply as ''Gun King Charley.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Imperato never apologizes for his work. ''Over the years,'' he says, ''we know we've sold lots of guns to people who have used them to protect their lives, and that's a good feeling.'' But he adds that he sometimes worries about what his three children, 14, 11 and 8, will end up thinking of his career. ''Honestly, it occurs to me. They don't ask about it, but I know they probably hear about the issues in school, about how gun dealers are bad. And I don't want them to think their father is bad.''</p>
