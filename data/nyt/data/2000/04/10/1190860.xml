        <p>British Airways and the online business-travel service GetThere.com plan to announce on Monday that they will create customized Web sites to provide corporate travel agency services for small and midsize businesses in Britain and Europe.</p>
        <p>The new sites will be based on GetThere's Global Manager, an electronic travel service used by large corporations like Nike and Cisco Systems to book business trips for employees.

        <p>British Airways and the online business-travel service GetThere.com plan to announce on Monday that they will create customized Web sites to provide corporate travel agency services for small and midsize businesses in Britain and Europe.</p>
        <p>The new sites will be based on GetThere's Global Manager, an electronic travel service used by large corporations like Nike and Cisco Systems to book business trips for employees. British Airways will enable small and midsize business users to book air, car and hotel reservations with the same management and reporting tools that large corporations use. While companies will be able to book flights on other airlines, British Airways will be the default choice.</p>
        <p>A small business, for example, could identify certain employees who would be allowed to book business-class fares and designate other employees as eligible only for coach fares. The employer might also create guidelines governing the kind of accommodations various types of employees are allowed to book. The system would allow employees to identify preferred airlines or hotels with which the company has negotiated discounts.</p>
        <p>Companies would be able to create their own customized sites within the portal.</p>
        <p>The new site is part of British Airways' push into electronic commerce, particularly into the vaunted business-to-business portion of that market. The new site also fits with the airline's shift, after recent losses, toward attracting more customers willing to pay business-class fares, which have a significantly higher profit margin than coach seats.</p>
        <p>Simon Parks Smith, manager of British Airways' business-to-business ventures, said the new site was ''an opportunity for us to use e-commerce'' to reach small and midsize European businesses.</p>
        <p>For GetThere, based in Menlo Park, Calif., the link-up with British Airways gives the young company considerable marketing strength without having to spend the large sums that some dot-com companies are forced to invest to build their brands.</p>
        <p>GetThere has been eyeing the European market for some time. It opened a London office here recently and is adding new features to its site to offer European customers services like booking reservations on trains and ferries.</p>
        <p>Whether GetThere will ever put American Express's corporate travel service out of business remains questionable -- or perhaps the wrong question. The company's clients include American Express, which uses the GetThere service for some of its own clients.</p>
