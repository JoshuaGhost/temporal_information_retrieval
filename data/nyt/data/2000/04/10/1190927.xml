        <p>In a harrowingly close vote that showed more indecision than clear favor, Greek voters on Sunday narrowly re-elected the Socialist prime minister, Costas Simitis, a reserved technocrat who brought the faltering Greek economy into line with the European Union.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simitis's mandate was jolted by Costas Karamanlis, leader of the New Democracy Party, a fresh but untested politician who tapped into voters' thirst for change.</p>
        <p>With 90 percent of the vote counted, Mr. Simitis's party, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or Pasok, was ahead by less than 1 percentage point, about 30,000 votes.</p>
        <p>After a long, emotional roller coaster of a night, a smiling Mr. Simitis, 64, arrived at the central election headquarters at 1:45 a.m. as fireworks in the green-and-white Pasok colors went off in the sky. He claimed a victory he described as ''greater than the numbers.'' He promised to work for stability and greater prosperity and called for an end to political differences. He did not mention his opponent.</p>
        <p>The first partial exit polls had projected that New Democracy would be ahead by 1 percentage point, which drove supporters and even some party leaders to predict victory, exultantly but prematurely.</p>
        <p>The waves of excitement and crashing disappointment so whipped up supporters of both candidates in Salonika, where Mr. Karamanlis's district is situated, that the riot police were called in to separate the two fevered crowds.</p>
        <p>The results were clearly not the ringing endorsement Mr. Simitis sought when he called early elections. But the virtual dead heat also reflected an unprecedented absence of deep ideological differences. Mr. Karamanlis, 43, espoused the same pragmatic path taken by his rival -- fiscal restraint to meet European prerequisites for inclusion in the European currency, the Euro, and rapprochement with Greece's historic enemy, Turkey.</p>
        <p>In a concession speech given at 2:30 a.m., Mr. Karamanlis referred to the new leverage his party won in the close race. ''It's obvious the government cannot proceed without our consent,'' he said. ''Our battle for a better Greece continues.''</p>
        <p>Voting is compulsory in Greece, and turnout among the nine million registered voters was close to 75 percent. Under Greece's system, the party that gets the largest percentage of the vote is assured of a parliamentary majority.</p>
        <p>Voters weighed Mr. Simitis's proven, stolid experience against their yearning for new blood after nearly 20 years of Pasok rule, interrupted only by a fragile New Democracy government from 1990 to 1993.</p>
        <p>Many voters who supported Mr. Simitis simultaneously expressed disenchantment with his party, Pasok, whose longevity in power bred corruption and inertia.</p>
        <p>''I was tempted until the last minute to vote for a new face, but in the end I chose the interests of the country,'' Konduvas Constantinos, 39, said after voting in an elementary school in central Athens. ''Greek membership in the Euro is very important, and when the future is uncertain, it's hard to choose someone who is also uncertain. I prefer a more experienced leader, even if I am a bit tired of Pasok.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the Greek economy fell embarrassingly short of the European Union's mimimum standards for membership in the Euro. Greece has since caught up, and is almost certain to be included in the Euro next January. But that also proved a liability, since few voters said they felt that Greece's inclusion remained at risk, and many complained about the punishing effects of the government's fiscal austerity.</p>
        <p>Greeks only recently -- and unevenly -- began feeling the benefits of economic growth, now 3.5 percent.</p>
        <p>Even many hard-core Pasok voters defected. ''I voted for Costa, the untested one,'' a 44-year-old civil servant in the Finance Ministry named Maria said. ''We saw the results of what the tested candidate did, and we think it is time for someone else.''</p>
        <p>Strangely, it is a tribute to Mr. Simitis's efforts to curb the Greek tradition of political control of civil service jobs that she felt no risk in voting for the opposition, though she declined to give her last name.</p>
        <p>Mr. Karamanlis, a lawyer who got his doctorate degree at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts in 1985, ran an energetic, skillful campaign, but he is chiefly known as the nephew and namesake of Constantine Karamanlis, the founder of New Democracy and a former president and prime minister. Many voters warmed to his gregarious campaign style, which contrasted with the incumbent's stolid diffidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simitis, an academic who was driven into exile by the military junta that ruled Greece between 1967 and 1974, was a co-founder of his party. Since taking office in 1996, he has moved the party sharply away from its anti-NATO, anti-European, anti-capitalist roots. Like Tony Blair with his ''new Labor'' in Britain, he represents a ''new Pasok,'' aimed at the center. That shift alienated old party loyalists, even as it attracted younger independent voters.</p>
        <p>The vote count was hair-raising, but the nine-week campaign was bland by Greek standards, which in itself marked a significant change from the past. ''This is the first time since World War II that the U.S. was not an issue in the campaign,'' said the American ambassador, Nicholas Burns. ''Its also the first campaign since 1965 that hasn't been marked by a huge ideological chasm.''</p>
        <p>Mostly, the battle was over social issues. Mr. Karamanlis sought to exploit discontent over unemployment, which is now at 11 percent, bloated and inefficient social services, and antiquated state monopolies.</p>
