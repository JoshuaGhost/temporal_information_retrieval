        <p>Comment on decision by Computer Associates to have founder Charles B Wang and executives Sanjay Kumar and Russell J Artzt return 22 percent of millions of shares of stock they received following decision by Delaware Chancery Court, which ruled shares were given under plan that lacked clause adjusting their awards for splits (S)</p>

        <p>When Charles B. Wang, founder of Computer Associates, received more than $600 million in stock, and two other executives -- Sanjay Kumar, the president, and Russell J. Artzt, the executive vice president -- a total of more than $400 million in 1998, shareholders screamed, asking why so much to so few. Had these shares, equal to 3.75 percent of the company's value, been divided among all employees, each would have received $113,000.</p>

        <p>When Charles B. Wang, founder of Computer Associates, received more than $600 million in stock, and two other executives -- Sanjay Kumar, the president, and Russell J. Artzt, the executive vice president -- a total of more than $400 million in 1998, shareholders screamed, asking why so much to so few. Had these shares, equal to 3.75 percent of the company's value, been divided among all employees, each would have received $113,000.</p>
        <p>Last November, Vice Chancellor Myron Steele of Delaware Chancery Court ruled that the executives had to give back about half those shares because they received them under a stock plan that lacked a clause adjusting their awards for splits. The company appealed, but last month it quietly agreed to have the executives return more than 22 percent of their shares, and to pay the New York law firm, Tenzer &amp; Greenblatt, that had challenged the awards.</p>
