        <p>LONG before the $3.4 billion write-off, the nasty Warner lawsuit and a tsunami of bad press, Vanity Fair called Sony's botched 1989 acquisition of Columbia Pictures ''a comic epic.''

        <p>LONG before the $3.4 billion write-off, the nasty Warner lawsuit and a tsunami of bad press, Vanity Fair called Sony's botched 1989 acquisition of Columbia Pictures ''a comic epic.'' The question lingers: how did Sony, the savvy Japanese electronics and entertainment giant -- the company that brought you Walkmans, Trinitrons and Playstations -- get fleeced so badly by Hollywood?</p>
        <p>It wasn't, it turns out, merely ''unprecedented naivete,'' as Forbes snidely remarked before the ink on the deal was dry. Sony had plenty of street-smart American advisers, including Michael Ovitz, the former superagent, and Pete Peterson, the investment banker, and the company knew it was being held up. Indeed, a month before the purchase was announced, Sony's top leadership decided not to go ahead with the deal.</p>
        <p>In August 1989, at an executive committee meeting in Tokyo, Norio Ohga, then chief executive and the strongest advocate of the acquisition, acknowledged that he had gotten cold feet. Akio Morita, Sony's charismatic founder and chairman, immediately announced that he, too, had reservations. ''Per chairman, Columbia acquisition abandoned,'' the meeting minutes read.</p>
        <p>So what breathed life back into the  deal that would prove a bigger bomb than Columbia's subsequent remake of ''Godzilla''? During the dinner break, it appears, several board members overheard Morita, who died last October, say under his breath: ''It's really too bad. I've always dreamed of owning a Hollywood studio.'' As John Nathan tells it in ''Sony: The Private Life'' (Houghton Mifflin, $26): ''No one spoke. But when the committee reconvened, Ohga announced that after careful consideration he now felt strongly, assuming the chairman concurred, that Sony should move ahead after all.''</p>
        <p>In short, faced with overwhelming evidence that Columbia was a bad deal, Sony allowed an even more overwhelming desire not to disappoint the company's father figure -- what Mr. Nathan calls ''sentimental logic'' -- to triumph.</p>
        <p>This and other delicious revelations make Mr. Nathan's authorized corporate biography of Sony highly intriguing, to put it mildly. The author treats Sony's rise from a tiny radio repair shop in a bomb-ravaged Tokyo after World War II to a $50 billion, globe-straddling giant as a convoluted family saga. He sees the key to Sony's triumphs and setbacks in the ''skein of personal relationships'' at the company's pinnacle rather than in hard-headed calculation of the bottom line.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nathan, an Emmy-winning documentary filmmaker as well as professor of Japanese culture at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has a huge edge over the legions of reporters who have scrutinized Sony in the past. For one thing, Sony, which has refused to cooperate on other books, granted him unprecedented access to its top executives and its archives. For another, Mr. Nathan, the translator of Kenzaburo Oe and biographer of Yukio Mishima, two of Japan's greatest novelists, is not merely fluent in Japanese but, as a former colleague of Mr. Nathan's said, ''can speak Japanese like a truck driver. And also like a member of the emperor's household.''</p>
        <p>MR. NATHAN uses his filmmaker's eye, intimate knowledge of Japanese culture and uncanny ability to tease the most surprising confessions from his interviewees to dispel stereotypes of Japanese management.</p>
        <p>From the book's beguiling opening scene, in which Sony's founders -- Morita, the 14th-generation sake scion, and Masuru Ibuka, the older, impulsive engineer -- play with toys and gadgets on the carpet, Mr. Nathan makes a persuasive case that Sony was an autocracy run by aloof fathers in search of adoptive ''sons.'' Of Morita and Ibuka, a Sony insider said, ''They were closer than lovers.''</p>
        <p>Biological sons, by contrast, tended to be ignored and shunted aside. After Morita's stroke in 1993, his younger son, Masao, said forlornly: ''It's not fair: now I'll never hear him tell me I'm doing a good job no matter how hard I work or how I succeed. It's not fair!''</p>
        <p>From Sony's early days, yearning to fulfill the elder's dream sometimes meant a willingness to satisfy any whim. ''For Akia Morita, interfering with a plan conceived by his senior partner, obstructing his dream or vision, or in any ways disappointing whatever desire he chose to entertain, however childish or irrational, would always be unthinkable,'' Mr. Nathan writes. Ibuka, we learn, almost bankrupted the company through his stubborn refusal to abandon an unworkable technology for color television.</p>
        <p>Even today, in what is supposedly a new era of more professional management, the father-son dynamic looms large. Toward the end of the book, Sony's current president, Nobuyuki Idei, reveals that Mr. Ohga, the current chairman, ''confronts me once a week, every time we meet, with the same challenge: I created the CD, the Minidisc, the this and that: What have you done? What are you going to do?''</p>
        <p>''So I promise to behave the way he expects the president of Sony to behave. After all, he's the daddy.''</p>
        <p>For an authorized biographer, Mr. Nathan doesn't pull many punches. Star-struck as he sometimes sounds, he lets us know that Ibuka, the visionary innovator, was clueless when it came to information technology; that Morita, Japan's premier business statesman, was a domestic tyrant, womanizer and social climber; that Mr. Ohga, an accomplished musician and daring pilot, lacks the magnetism of his predecessor. Better still, almost all this information comes by way of on-the-record quotations from intimates.</p>
        <p>Yet ''Sony: The Private Life'' isn't nearly as good a book as it could -- or should -- have been. It doesn't have the narrative punch of Nancy Griffin  and Kim Masters's ''Hit and Run,'' a chronicle of Sony's Hollywood misadventure, much less the novelistic sweep of dynastic stories like Ron Chernow's ''House of Morgan.''</p>
        <p>By abandoning chronology for a series of overlapping profiles, Mr. Nathan falls into the trap that has bedeviled many a biographer of parallel lives, frequently losing sight of the bigger story he's trying to tell. His writing is too often formulaic and bland; the portrait of Morita, surely of greatest interest to American readers, is particularly disappointing. And, given the rich trove of reporting on Sony by journalists and Mr. Nathan's contention that he is writing ''history,'' the lack of endnotes or a bibliography is unforgivable.</p>
        <p>STILL, I admit I burst into tears a couple of times while reading it, including during the poignant scene in which Morita's wife, Yoshiko, simply can't bring herself to tell her husband, silenced and confined to his wheelchair by his stroke, that his best friend, Ibuka, has died.</p>
        <p>And I found myself wholly absorbed by Mr. Nathan's retelling of the Columbia Pictures debacle. In short, there are enough unforgettable characters, great lines and killer scenes to make ''Sony: The Private Life'' an entertaining script -- one that kept me glued to my seat until the very end.</p>
