        <p>YUJI YODA and Michelle Marroquin wear the joyful expressions of children lost in a candy store. But they are not children, nor are they surrounded by sweets; they are grown-up dancers who have just stepped into New York City's oldest synagogue building, on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Mr. Yoda and Ms. Marroquin, members of Zvi Gotheiner and Dancers, are the first to arrive for rehearsal at the site of Mr. Gotheiner's new work, ''The Amber Room.''</p>
        <p>''Wow!'' Ms. Marroquin gasps, her voice echoing high into the upper reaches of the 7,000-square-foot space with its 50-foot ceiling.</p>
        <p>Instead of waiting outside for Mr. Gotheiner and the remaining 12 dancers and 2 understudies, the pair decide to explore the basement of the 19th-century building, now called the Angel Orensanz Foundation and Center for the Arts. Squeals of pleasure announce the company's arrival a few minutes later.</p>
        <p>Gathering his flock around him, Mr. Gotheiner asks, ''So, people, what do you think?''</p>
        <p>More shrieks ensue, but as the excitement wears off, the climate of the sanctuary begins to sink in. It is cold, which will cause the dancers' muscles to tighten up, a serious matter because the performance will take place throughout the building. Mr. Orensanz, a sculptor who bought the synagogue in 1986 and maintains a studio in one of its balconies, assures Mr. Gotheiner that it takes the heaters about a half hour to warm the space. But the temperature in the basement, a 3,500-square-foot room decorated with white columns, never reaches comfort level.</p>
        <p>Many choreographers have staged dances at places of worship, where the biggest challenge often is to create a piece that is not overwhelmed by the grandeur of the space. Mr. Gotheiner, 47, has toyed with the idea of presenting a dance at the former synagogue for 10 years and recently discovered the perfect source of inspiration: the Amber Room, an early-18th-century Russian masterpiece made of walls of carved amber and stolen by the Nazis during World War II. ''It's a frame for possibilities,'' he says. ''I'm not going to tell the story of the Amber Room, but I will use it as a springboard for a stance on art and power.''</p>
        <p>While the original room is believed to be lost (it is currently being replicated in Pushkin, Russia, with the help of a German corporation), Mr. Gotheiner hopes to bring it back to life through dance for seven evenings at the Orensanz Center on April 20, 21 and 24 through 28.</p>
        <p>''The Amber Room,'' in a way, harks back to performance practices of the 60's and 70's, when audience participation was sometimes solicited. The synagogue is a good space for that interactive notion as well as for Mr. Gotheiner's choreographic sensibility, which favors earthy, lush movement and an invigorating blend of balletic clarity and modern weightiness.</p>
        <p>For the first 50 minutes of ''The Amber Room,'' audiences will enter the basement from a path at 172 Norfolk Street between East Houston and Stanton Streets. What starts out to be an intimate church-basement sort of dance will erupt into powerful group performances in the main sanctuary. But right now, the basement is deemed too cold for dancing and Mr. Gotheiner reluctantly decides to rehearse a downstairs section upstairs.</p>
        <p>Since Mr. Gotheiner's plan is to have the audience move with the action -- in some cases gliding alongside the dancers -- he initiates some improvisation, first frowning at the uneven wooden floor, from which a few shiny nailheads protrude. ''This is not suitable for dancing,'' he says. ''We'll have to build a floor, so be careful. But downstairs we'll use what they have -- it's nice.''</p>
        <p>He separates the company into two groups -- the ''audience'' and the performers. Rebecca Chisman assumes a pose in the audience, places a hand on her cocked hip and taps her foot humorously.</p>
        <p>''What are they doing over there?'' she mutters. ''Is this a dance concert?'' Mr. Gotheiner grins, then instructs the dancers to find a partner in the audience and puts on a tape of a lively tango. As the music begins, the dancers improvise in Mr. Gotheiner's trademark style: graceful tilts and lunges, extended arms and legs with exuberant turns. Gradually they slink up to their audience counterparts, initiating tangolike dips and spins. They pull their partners to the wall and place them in various poses against it. The music stops, but the dancers hold their positions for several seconds, during which the people set against the wall take on an eerie resemblance to silhouettes in early Roman murals. Mr. Yoda, whom Mr. Gotheiner has designated the ''eraser,'' pulls each body off the wall, rendering it once again three-dimensional.</p>
        <p>''O.K., this time you had a very willing audience,'' Mr. Gotheiner says, laughing. ''But have a sense of who to approach. If somebody disagrees, don't fight it.'' He picks up the portable CD player. ''Put some clothes on,'' he advises the dancers. ''We're going downstairs.''</p>
        <p>At this point, there's no set order for the pieces, a concern that Mr. Gotheiner brushes aside. The basement is the site for a series of short solos and duets; as the dancers move to their individual ''stages'' throughout the room, the audience will follow. Mr. Gotheiner selects June Balish, a sensuous dancer, to begin; she pulls a chair close to a column and as the music starts, wraps and unwraps her arms and legs around the pillar while poised on the chair.</p>
        <p>Instead of waiting her turn, Ms. Marroquin jumps onto the only raised platform in the basement and launches into her duet with Mr. Yoda. Turning to the others, she points out her superior cheekbones, nose, waist and legs; Mr. Yoda watches her in half-embarrassment, half-horror. ''Here it is,'' she boasts, running a hand down the side of her body. ''What you can see is what you can't have. Look at this nose. It's from my father. It's mine now.''</p>
        <p>While ''The Amber Room'' isn't specifically about the Holocaust, there are several references to it; for example, Ms. Marroquin's unsettling, vain dissection of her features recalls Hitler's obsession with genetic perfection. At Mr. Gotheiner's command, the dancers ascend a short flight of stairs to the sanctuary, where the choreographer arranges them in a pyramid with the smallest row at the bima, or pulpit. He selects Russian music similar to the kind he marched to as a boy living in a socialist kibbutz in Israel. As the dancers begin a series of forceful turns and lunges, swinging their arms in unison like soldiers, it is evident that Mr. Gotheiner has expanded much of the material from the earlier solo and duets. But intimacy is replaced by the power of a collective.</p>
        <p>In ''The Amber Room'' Mr. Gotheiner hopes to show a relationship between dance's elusiveness and the mysterious whereabouts of the famed Amber Room. But the piece is not finished yet. ''I have no idea what else we're going to do up here,'' he says dismally, but his excited eyes reveal something else. ''For a lot of this process, on purpose, I am keeping a gray area. If I can move aside and let it flow on its own that would be great.</p>
        <p>''There is a place, I think, when creativity starts to take off, and there's nothing intellectual about it. All of a sudden, there is a miracle. I don't want to manipulate it.''</p>
