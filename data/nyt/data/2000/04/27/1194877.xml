        <p>While one high-profile candidate to fill the Rangers' vacancy at general manager is telling people close to him that he is willing to listen to overtures, another person who was believed to be high on the Rangers' list is officially out of the running.</p>
        <p>Glen Sather, the Edmonton Oilers' president, now says he is willing to listen to a Rangers' proposal, a person familiar with Sather's thinking said. But Mario Lemieux, the owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins, said yesterday that he would not give the Rangers permission to speak with Craig Patrick, his general manager.</p>
        <p>''Craig is a big part of our organization,'' Lemieux said yesterday through the team spokesman, Tom McMillan. ''He's not going anywhere. We intend to sign him to a long-term contract this summer.''</p>
        <p>Patrick, who turns 54 on May 20, was the Rangers' general manager from 1980 to 1986. He has been with the Penguins since 1989, and was the architect of their Stanley Cup-winning teams in 1991 and 1992. Patrick is entering the last year of a five-year contract believed to be paying him nearly $800,000 next season.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old Sather, who has spent the last 24 years with Edmonton, has two years remaining on his contract, which will pay him nearly $2 million a season. But Sather has an escape clause written into the contract.</p>
