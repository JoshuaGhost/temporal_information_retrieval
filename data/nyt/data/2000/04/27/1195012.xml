        <p>Andy Pettitte has started 14 postseason games for the Yankees -- games in pressure-filled Octobers, games that would help determine if the team had life remaining. Pettitte has pitched in five straight Septembers -- important, season-turning months when the Yankees were trying to insure that they rolled into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>It is fair to estimate that Pettitte has started several dozen games that were much more critical than yesterday's chilly April encounter with the Twins. This game looked like another blip on the schedule as recently as one week ago. The Yankees were cruising with the best record in the major leagues, the Twins were terrible and no one expected distress in Yankeeland.</p>

        <p>Andy Pettitte has started 14 postseason games for the Yankees -- games in pressure-filled Octobers, games that would help determine if the team had life remaining. Pettitte has pitched in five straight Septembers -- important, season-turning months when the Yankees were trying to insure that they rolled into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>It is fair to estimate that Pettitte has started several dozen games that were much more critical than yesterday's chilly April encounter with the Twins. This game looked like another blip on the schedule as recently as one week ago. The Yankees were cruising with the best record in the major leagues, the Twins were terrible and no one expected distress in Yankeeland.</p>
        <p>Still, by yesterday, Pettitte's first start in 19 days had escalated in significance because of the diminishing fortunes of the Yankees. Joe Torre said that the start was much more important for Pettitte than it was for the Yankees because he was returning from a strained back muscle, but this is the same calm manager who has been begging for a starter other than Orlando Hernandez to pitch crisply. Even in April and even against the Twins, with their meager $16 million payroll, it was a pivotal afternoon for Pettitte and for the Yankees at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Pettitte acknowledged that. He lasted five innings, but they were strong, almost dominating innings, that helped the Yankees defeat the Twins, 2-0, and avoid being swept by them in a three-game series at the Stadium for the first time since 1968. That was a mediocre year for the Yankees, but this is not supposed to be mediocre. It just seemed mediocre lately as the Yankees lost four of their last five, causing words like urgency to creep into questions.</p>
        <p>''Urgency?'' Pettitte said. ''I don't know about that, but we haven't been playing good. Obviously, there's a sense of pride in this clubhouse. You don't want to get beat by anybody. I was watching the game last night and they said we hadn't been swept by them since 1968. You start thinking about that.''</p>
        <p>So what did Pettitte think when he turned off the television and went to bed knowing that a possibly embarrassing end to a 32-year drought rested in his left hand?</p>
        <p>''I said, 'You had better be sharp tomorrow,' '' Pettitte said. ''That's what it made me think. You block it out once you get out there. You try to get ahead in the count and make your pitches.''</p>
        <p>It is a simple strategy. Get ahead. Make your pitches. Every pitcher in the world knows those steps are essential for being successful. Pettitte told himself that and then he went out and did it, yielding just three hits, striking out four and walking one. It was a refreshing sight for the Yankees because their starters were 1-4 with a 10.66 earned run average and 10 homers allowed in 25 1/3 innings during the five-game skid.</p>
        <p>''That was a big lift for us,'' Torre said. ''We're getting back in shape, slowly but surely.''</p>
        <p>From the moment Pettitte put his toes on the rubber in the first inning, he looked determined and it seemed as if he were working with a 15-second clock. Pettitte threw a pitch, he got the ball back from Jorge Posada and he was ready to throw again in a few seconds. He barely moved off the rubber and only stopped his swift pace to blow warm air onto his hand.</p>
        <p>Since Pettitte's fastball was moving, he constantly pumped it inside on right-handed hitters while mixing in some curveballs and changeups. He used sinkers against left-handed hitters, not even showing the pitch to the right-handers because the fastball was so effective.</p>
        <p>Unlike in Pettitte's first start, when he shook off Posada on 9 of 12 pitches in the fourth inning of a 7-5 loss to the Mariners, the pitcher and the catcher were in sync. Pettitte retired Denny Hocking on a slow roller to third to strand two in the third, he got Butch Huskey to hit into a double play to end the fourth and he struck out Jason Maxwell with a 3-2 fastball in the fifth. That was Pettitte's 76th and final pitch, as the Yankees did not want him to exceed 80 pitches. Three relievers finished the shutout, Derek Jeter and Tino Martinez had homers and Pettitte's back felt a little stiff, but fine.</p>
        <p>''You want to be able to make some pitches when you have to and pitch some big games when you have to,'' Pettitte said. ''I was very happy with the command I had with that much of a layoff.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte felt like more of a bystander then a teammate when he was on the disabled list because all he could do was ''get treatment all day and junk like that'' while the Yankees were playing. But the Yankees faltered, none of the starters beside El Duque were competent and Torre was fortunate that he had the perfect weapon for what was a big game in April. He had Pettitte.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to think you're something special, but I'd like to think I'm a big part of this team,'' Pettitte said. ''It was nice to get out there and give us a good performance. I'm just another piece of our team, getting us back to being complete.''</p>
