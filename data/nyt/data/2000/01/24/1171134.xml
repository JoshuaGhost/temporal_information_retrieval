        <p>With two minutes left and ahead by 19 points, the Tennessee Titans paced their sideline and offered mild and measured congratulations among themselves. The Titans, though, looked worried. They wondered if this three-peat against the Jacksonville Jaguars was really complete, if their apparent spot in Super Bowl XXXIV would somehow vanish in an odd twist of surprise.</p>
        <p>Was it truly over?</p>
        <p>Had Jacksonville hidden a miracle in its pocket? Or, indeed, were the Tennessee Titans these playoffs' lone miracle team?</p>
        <p>With 1 minute 22 seconds left, Titans linebacker Eddie Robinson forced a fumble -- the sixth Jacksonville turnover this afternoon -- and cornerback Denard Walker recovered the ball near midfield. Jeff Fisher, the Tennessee coach, then jumped higher than any player had managed all afternoon. Fisher leapt into the waiting arms of Titans place-kicker Al Del Greco. Their embrace was joyful and their words flowed while they focused on each other's eyes.</p>
        <p>''It's over with!'' Fisher yelled.</p>
        <p>''We're going!'' Del Greco responded.</p>
        <p>To the Super Bowl. To play the St. Louis Rams, 11-6 winners over Tampa Bay today.</p>
        <p>As Fisher and Del Greco completed their merry spin, all of the Tennessee Titans turned Jacksonville's Alltel Stadium into their house. Their dance floor. Their party. It was fitting, especially since the Titans had done that all afternoon in a too-physical, too-confrontational, too-tough game for the Jaguars. It was Tennessee in a breezy 33-14 victory in the American Football Conference championship game today before 75,206 fans, the largest crowd ever in this stadium and the quickest group ever to exit, exasperated after their Jaguars were disjointed and exposed.</p>
        <p>As the game's final seconds ticked away, the Titans -- having scored the game's final 26 points -- were celebrating on the sideline full throttle, handshakes and hugs all around. Some players were even shooting with their own personal video cameras, savoring the scene, the moments. Out came the A.F.C. championship shirts and hats. It was bizarre that in this conference championship title game, with a Super Bowl berth at stake, with Tennessee on the road trying to beat Jacksonville in a historic manner, that the final seconds would end this way, not with any twinge of drama, but so relaxed and carefree for the Titans.</p>
        <p>But that was exactly what happened for Tennessee, a team that has won seven straight games. A team that opened its postseason with a victory at home in the wild-card game, beating Buffalo on a miracle lateral on a last-seconds kickoff, on a majestic play when it seemed there was no Titans pulse, no Titans chance. A team that won at Indianapolis against Peyton Manning and Edgerrin James and Marvin Harrison, controlling a dynamic offensive threesome that few teams contained this season.</p>
        <p>The Tennessee Titans are a team of destiny and more.</p>
        <p>''We were here today to make history!'' yelled receiver Yancey Thigpen across the Titans' locker room. Thigpen, who will miss the Super Bowl because of a broken right foot sustained today, knew that no team had ever won a conference championship game on the road as part of a three-games-in-one-season sweep of an opponent.</p>
        <p>Tennessee did it today and made glimmering history.</p>
        <p>''We believe in ourselves, we've got a lot of talent, a lot of depth, team speed and aggressive guys that fly to the ball and with the ball,'' said Anthony Dorsett, a Titans safety. ''We expected Jacksonville to start fast. We also expected them to be unable to sustain that.''</p>
        <p>Those expectations became reality.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville exploded to a 7-0 lead. Tennessee tied the game at 7-7. Jacksonville jumped ahead, 14-7, with 4:36 left before halftime. And then, with 1:34 left, came one of the game's two signature plays -- the Jaguars' Reggie Barlow fumbled a punt at his 19-yard line that was recovered by Titans safety Steve Jackson. That play led to Del Greco's 34-yard field goal only 20 seconds before halftime. The Jacksonville lead at halftime was 4 points instead of 7 points.</p>
        <p>Tennessee absorbed that momentum. It won the third quarter, 16-0. It won the final quarter, 7-0.</p>
        <p>In the second half there were two 1-yard touchdown runs by quarterback Steve McNair, a safety and Derrick Mason's 80-yard return of a free kick for a touchdown.</p>
        <p>A fast Jacksonville start -- and then a Jaguars crawl.</p>
        <p>''They talked all week about matching us as a physical team,'' Thigpen said. ''But their mouth said one thing and their mind said another. Any time you've already lost twice to a team that stays close at the start of the next game, you start to doubt yourselves. That's what they did. They made a lot of mistakes but we forced them into some of those mistakes. They tried to get physical with us, but if you haven't played that way all year, how are you going to do that in one game?''</p>
        <p>In the second quarter, Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, on a pass from the Tennessee 6, was intercepted in the Tennessee end zone by safety Marcus Roberston. (Roberston later broke his left ankle and, like Thigpen, will miss the Super Bowl.) And then, to end the half, there was the Barlow fumble.</p>
        <p>''When I looked up, they weren't that close to me,'' Barlow said. ''But those guys came full speed and after I dropped it, I should have just fallen on it. I messed up. I catch balls like that every day during the week, in practice before the game, and that happens.''</p>
        <p>After the first two turnovers, Jacksonville was tight. It would make four more for a total of two interceptions and four fumbles. It would commit nine penalties for 100 yards.</p>
        <p>''The penalties, the turnovers, you're not going to win football games that way,'' said Tom Coughlin, the Jacksonville coach. ''They work you to the point where you are the team that makes the errors. When we play them, we find the way to make the errors. However it happens, when we play Tennessee, we get a little out of our element and we turn the ball over, for whatever reason. We were never able to get the crowd back in the game and energize ourselves.''</p>
        <p>It was the stern Tennessee defense and the marvelous legs of McNair that helped bury Jacksonville for good. In addition to scoring twice in the second half, he offered the game's second signature play in spectacular fashion.</p>
        <p>It was McNair's third-and-1 run of 51 yards to the Jacksonville 1 that set up his final 1-yard touchdown run, with 6:59 left. It put the game squarely in Tennessee's hands. McNair scrambled 9 times for 91 yards, outrushing running back and teammate Eddie George (25 carries, 86 yards).</p>
        <p>And McNair did it with a sore big toe that had hampered him in practice all week. McNair passed for a touchdown and ran for two more and that easily offset Brunell's 226 passing yards and minus-1 rushing yards.</p>
        <p>Jacksonville too frequently lost both line battles. It got pushed around more than it shoved. It could not effectively tackle McNair.</p>
        <p>The game proved too big for too many Jaguars.</p>
        <p>''When the fourth quarter came, they couldn't score and pretty much knew it was over,'' Tennessee safety Blaine Bishop said. ''They knew we had their number.''</p>
        <p>The Tennessee Titans are made of miracles and more.</p>
