        <p>On the day after Robert Wood Johnson IV won the right to buy the Jets for $635 million, the losing bidder, Charles F. Dolan, expressed frustration, not bitterness.</p>
        <p>''Here I am, rejected three times,'' he said yesterday with a slight laugh, referring to past bids for the Cleveland Browns and the Washington Redskins. ''The exercise of buying an N.F.L. team is good for one's humility. You find things wrong about you that you never knew existed.''</p>

        <p>On the day after Robert Wood Johnson IV won the right to buy the Jets for $635 million, the losing bidder, Charles F. Dolan, expressed frustration, not bitterness.</p>
        <p>''Here I am, rejected three times,'' he said yesterday with a slight laugh, referring to past bids for the Cleveland Browns and the Washington Redskins. ''The exercise of buying an N.F.L. team is good for one's humility. You find things wrong about you that you never knew existed.''</p>
        <p>Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision, said his pursuit of the Jets reflected his satisfaction with Cablevision's ownership of Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers. ''When you're so close to the fire, and one of these come around so rarely, you have to be interested,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dolan refused to say if Cablevision's attention would now turn to trying to buy the Mets from Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday.</p>
        <p>''There are no discussions in progress,'' he said. ''We have to wait to see if there's a role for us.''</p>
        <p>Dolan offered $612 million for the Jets, but he had a far more difficult task than Johnson did in convincing National Football League owners of his worthiness. Cablevision's ownership of cable systems serving 3.4 million subscribers, and its sports assets, proved to be his undoing.</p>
        <p>But Dolan believed that covenants he signed -- which would have created a division between the Jets and his Cablevision assets -- provided adequate protection against his corporate power in the N.F.L., which bars corporations from owning teams.</p>
        <p>''They needed to be convinced that you would operate the Jets as if it was the only interest you have, without reference to anything else you have an interest in,'' Dolan said after returning from a Caribbean cruise with his extended family.</p>
        <p>''At first it gave me pause. If you operate the Jets and have the best sports organization in New York with Cablevision, there would be efficiencies by bringing them together. But the reality of their concerns was obvious.''</p>
        <p>He described how the league sought to ensure that the Jets would be run as a stand-alone organization, with no input from Madison Square Garden or Cablevision executives.</p>
        <p>In addition to agreeing to operate the Jets separately, Dolan agreed that if he became an N.F.L. owner, he would not vote on television issues.</p>
        <p>''The covenants were negotiated over a long period of time,'' he said. ''We came to agreement a number of times, and each time they had to be redrafted and they became more restrictive. The N.F.L. was encountering opinions from various owners, and the league wanted to satisfy them. It was clear the N.F.L. was trying to preserve some institutional ideas about how it should be run.''</p>
        <p>Joe Browne, a league spokesman, said: ''While everyone in the N.F.L. has a high regard for Mr. Dolan, there were management covenants that would have established precedents that troubled finance committee members. They continued to work to try to overcome the issues that ultimately could not be overcome. There were concerns about the next set of circumstances.''</p>
        <p>Dolan knew of the owners' concerns about his corporate assets but was surprised by how long the concerns lingered.</p>
        <p>''But I'm the sitting chairman of a company involved in media,'' he said. ''That's a specter for them. But don't ask me why. It's personal and subjective to the owners. They kept assuring me it was nothing personal: 'You're a wonderful guy, Chuck.' ''</p>
        <p>By the time John Hess, the son of the Jets' late owner, Leon Hess, met with the N.F.L.'s finance committee Tuesday morning, Dolan knew his bid faced virtually implacable opposition.</p>
        <p>''We knew we were in trouble,'' he said. He added, ''I don't think money had anything to do with it.''</p>
        <p>During the meeting, Johnson increased his bid by $10 million to cinch Hess's decision to recommend Johnson's offer. Dolan did not call from the cruise ship, which was docked at Barbados, to raise his bid.</p>
        <p>''Whatever I did wouldn't have mattered,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The finance committee voted by 8-0 to recommend Johnson to the league's full ownership, which meets next Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Had Dolan acquired the team, he said, he would have tried to build a new stadium. He declined to say if he would have tried to buy out the Jets' lease at Giants Stadium before it expired after the 2008 season.</p>
        <p>But he said he was intrigued by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's proposal to build a football stadium and a new Madison Square Garden over the rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan. ''We declared ourselves very much for that,'' Dolan said.</p>
