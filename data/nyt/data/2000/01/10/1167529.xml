        <p>When Jay Walker first introduced the Priceline ''name your own price'' system of buying airline tickets, he promised that other, similar markets would follow soon.</p>
        <p>And indeed, Priceline.com now offers a range of products including hotels, cars and groceries. In each of these areas, the concept is the same: customers get to propose the price, but Priceline gets to pick the actual hotel, car dealer or brand of chicken soup.</p>
        <p>From the start, Mr. Walker said credit cards were a perfect market. If customers can get a Visa card with the interest rate and features they want, why would they care which bank actually offered the card?</p>
        <p>But in practice, the idea was not so easy to execute. Priceline is finally set to announce a name-your-own-price credit card system today. But there is only one card issuer -- NextCard Inc. -- rather than competing providers as in most of Priceline's  other markets.</p>
        <p>Credit cards, it turns out, are harder in some ways even than airplane tickets, said Richard Braddock, Priceline's chief executive. While NextCard had the technology Priceline needed to be able to evaluate and respond to bids instantly, other banks did not have comparable systems.</p>
        <p>Under its existing system, NextCard, a two-year-old San Francisco company takes applications online (NextCard.com), looks up the applicant's credit history and offers a choice of three different card products with different rates, fees and other features. People with better credit records and those willing to transfer big balances, get better deals.</p>
        <p>On Priceline.com, by contrast, customers will fill out a short application and will also describe the credit card features they want: An interest rate, an annual fee, a credit limit, and optionally a rewards program (like travel miles). The system will instantly respond, either by offering that card, or offering alternative structures that are close to what the applicant wanted.</p>
        <p>In particular, NextCard will check how much the applicant owes on other cards and will offer lower rates if customers transfer all their balances to the new card.</p>
        <p>It is unclear, however, that in the absence of competing banks, whether NextCard will offer any better deals on Priceline than it does on its own site.</p>
        <p>Dan Springer, NextCard's director of marketing, said the company had every incentive to satisfy those customers who go through the bother of expressing interest on Priceline.</p>
        <p>''If someone says they want a 7.9 percent card, and I normally would give them a 9.9 card, I'm highly motivated to give them what they want,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But on the other hand, Mr. Springer concedes that NextCard could well find itself charging higher prices to Priceline customers because they turn out to be less loyal than card holders from other sources.</p>
        <p>''I have some concern that a Priceline type of customer may be less attractive because they are more focused on finding the best deal,'' said ''Many people don't shop around and just want a simple solution.''</p>
