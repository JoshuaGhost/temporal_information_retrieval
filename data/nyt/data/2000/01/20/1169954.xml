        <p>THE feminist revolution of the 1970's hasn't exactly upended the top echelons of the corporate world. But it has achieved a slow, significant evolution of women joining the ranks of top corporate officers at large corporations.</p>
        <p>This year, some 13 percent of corporate officers at Fortune 500 companies are expected to be women, up from 10 percent in 1996, according to projections by Catalyst, a nonprofit research organization in New York that works to advance women in business. Even so, just 5 percent of the top positions at the Fortune 500 companies -- with titles ranging from executive vice president to chairman -- were women in 1998, Catalyst said.</p>

        <p>THE feminist revolution of the 1970's hasn't exactly upended the top echelons of the corporate world. But it has achieved a slow, significant evolution of women joining the ranks of top corporate officers at large corporations.</p>
        <p>This year, some 13 percent of corporate officers at Fortune 500 companies are expected to be women, up from 10 percent in 1996, according to projections by Catalyst, a nonprofit research organization in New York that works to advance women in business. Even so, just 5 percent of the top positions at the Fortune 500 companies -- with titles ranging from executive vice president to chairman -- were women in 1998, Catalyst said.</p>
        <p>One woman who has made it is Abby Kohnstamm, the first woman to serve as senior vice president of marketing at International Business Machines. She is also a member of the elite 13-member corporate executive committee that governs the corporation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kohnstamm, who oversees more than $1 billion in advertising and marketing spending, is credited with helping to transform Big Blue's global image as a stodgy old mainframe business to a cutting-edge corporation focused on electronic business. The focus on electronic business can be seen in I.B.M.'s ongoing advertising campaign about e business using the slogan, ''Solutions for a small planet.''</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Kohnstamm is being named the Advertising Woman of the Year by Advertising Women of New York for her role at I.B.M., taking her place next to other stars among women in advertising, marketing and the media. The award from the club clearly signals that Ms. Kohnstamm has become one of the most powerful women in advertising today.</p>
        <p>What Ms. Kohnstamm said she had learned over the years is to forget the numbers not in her favor and to just persevere.</p>
        <p>''I tell people, when they ask, that the first thing is to decide what you're trying to accomplish and not get distracted with this other stuff,'' said the soft-spoken Ms. Kohnstamm in a phone interview from her Armonk, N.Y., office. ''Just keep your eye on the ball, develop a bit of a tough skin. Take some chances; do some things; make some things happen.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kohnstamm took I.B.M.'s marketing helm in 1993 after being recruited by Louis V. Gerstner Jr., the chief executive -- whom she had once served as executive assistant at American Express.</p>
        <p>Led by Mr. Gerstner, I.B.M.'s  stock has moved from the low- to mid-$20's to the $114 range, according to split-adjusted figures from Steve Milunovich, a computer industry analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>But while the financial and operational overhaul was extensive, marketing also played a strategic role in I.B.M.'s success, he said.</p>
        <p>''Initially the job was a financial restructuring,'' Mr. Milunovich said. ''But marketing played a very big role -- they had to reposition the company. Our surveys find the perception of I.B.M. has definitely improved and that they are seen as a key beneficiary of e-commerce spending, which is the future.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kohnstamm's challenge was to completely change the public's perception of I.B.M. as yesterday's news. To do that, Ms. Kohnstamm, in 1994, dismissed I.B.M.'s 80 advertising agencies around the world and consolidated all advertising at Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, a unit of the WPP Group.</p>
        <p>In choosing O.&amp; M., she selected a shop she had a long relationship with at American Express and an old friend and colleague, Shelly Lazarus, Ogilvy's chairwoman and chief executive. Ms. Kohnstamm said the consolidation was intended to give I.B.M. one voice and one focus around the world.</p>
        <p>''A lot has been made of our personal relationship,'' Ms. Kohnstamm said. ''It was a factor, but it wasn't the only factor. Ogilvy &amp; Mather really had a passion, and it wasn't just Shelly. They believed we could collectively relaunch this brand and they wanted that challenge.''</p>
        <p>The edict to O.&amp; M. was to tap into I.B.M.'s equities and reinvigorate the brand, but do so in a manner that would surprise people. They came up with ''Solutions for a small planet,'' a campaign that shows the problems of the electronic revolution and how I.B.M. has the solutions. The campaign also came up with a language for the electronic revolution -- e-business, which appears in all I.B.M. communications as a sort of symbolic shorthand for the consumer to understand that I.B.M. is integrally involved in Web marketing and applications.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to talk about the company in a manner that was surprising, and that would take people a bit off guard, that maybe I should reconsider I.B.M.,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''In some respects, we pulled out the latent equities we always had --  our enormous technical and business expertise and our image as a company that you can count on.''</p>
        <p>The mother of two children, ages 10 and 15, Ms. Kohnstamm said she had also been lucky to work in companies and for people who allow flexibility for women. She said companies need to recognize that women and men have a balancing act between work and family.</p>
        <p>Her own philosophy is that when her family needs her, she is there for them. But, she said, she also doesn't abuse that privilege.</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Kohnstamm did not start out so focused. She pursued a career as a professional dancer and even received a master's degree in dance education before switching gears and gaining an M.B.A. from New York University.</p>
        <p>It is fitting, perhaps, that she ended up at I.B.M. Her father, Chuck Francis, retired from I.B.M. in 1987 after 30 years, eventually as head of advertising. The famous Little Tramp campaign using a Charlie Chaplin character was developed under his leadership, she said.</p>
        <p>''I guess it's in my blood,'' she said.</p>
