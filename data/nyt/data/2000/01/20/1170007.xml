        <p>Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's resignation  as honorary chairman of his beloved Christian Democrats was forced on him by his own embattled proteges. But it will not stop the unraveling of his own reputation or that of his party. By defiantly flouting his legal obligation to reveal the names of donors to a secret campaign fund, Mr. Kohl compounds the damage he has already caused.</p>
        <p>For 16 years Mr. Kohl dominated German politics. He guided the peaceful reunification of his country, helped fashion the political framework for a united Europe and led the way to economic cooperation on the Continent and the adoption of a common currency. But his admission that for years he operated a system of secret accounts to handle undeclared cash donations to his party has dealt a heavy blow to his formidable reputation. Now it threatens to consume the party as well.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors in Bonn last month opened a preliminary criminal investigation of Mr. Kohl, who has acknowledged that he received more than $1 million in undisclosed political contributions while in office. The former chancellor had stunned Germans in November when he admitted, after previous denials, that he had used illegal bank accounts to channel secret political contributions to local branches of his party. But he has refused to disclose the names of the contributors, citing his ''word of honor'' not to do so. Mr. Kohl's image as a statesman is rapidly degenerating into that of a corrupt and arrogant machine boss.</p>
        <p>The Kohl affair is a reminder that the United States is not the only advanced democracy where the insatiable demands of campaign finance threaten to undermine democracy. Since the reckless fund-raising of the 1996 American presidential campaign, France, Spain, Italy and Britain have all been rocked by fund-raising scandals. It is troubling that this huge scandal is occurring in Germany, which has the most generous system of state financing of political parties in the world -- a result of similar scandals in the 1980's. Clearly, public financing of elections has to be linked to vigorous enforcement.</p>
        <p>The current scandal grew out of a public prosecutor's investigation into cash payments of a half-million dollars to party officials linked to an arms export deal with Saudi Arabia. Party officials also allegedly received large sums of money from a French oil company that took over a chemical plant in eastern Germany in 1992.</p>
        <p>The widening investigation has exposed extensive deceit in the upper reaches of Mr. Kohl's party.  Last week his protege and successor as party leader, Wolfgang Schauble, admitted accepting $52,000 in cash from the same fugitive arms broker who gave secret donations to Mr. Kohl's intermediaries. And yesterday the party said that $4.5 million more in apparently illicit funds had been uncovered. Nobody has yet alleged that the former chancellor benefited personally from secret accounts. But he must not be allowed to hide behind his stature as a statesman. If Mr. Kohl is to salvage his diminished reputation -- and his party's -- he should disclose what he knows.</p>
