        <p>Britain declared tonight that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was medically unfit to stand trial in Spain and that it was now inclined to abandon the extradition case against him.</p>
        <p>The statement opens the way for the former Chilean dictator to avoid charges of crimes against humanity and to return to his homeland.</p>
        <p>Home Secretary Jack Straw released the results of a Jan. 5 examination of the 84-year-old general by four British specialists and said he was ''minded'' to ''take the view that no purpose would be served by continuing'' the extradition proceedings.</p>
        <p>The medical report and Mr. Straw's reaction to it appeared to mark the closing stages of a case that has shaken international law, galvanized human rights and exile groups, and stirred passionate old antagonisms in Chile.</p>
        <p>General Pinochet has been under house arrest in England for nearly 15 months awaiting the outcome of  complicated legal and judicial moves surrounding a Spanish judge's request to send him to Madrid, where he would face 35 charges of torture and conspiracy to torture dating from the days of his strongman rule in Chile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straw did not make clear how soon he might exercise his power to end the extradition proceedings, on compassionate grounds of age and health. But he said he was writing to various rights groups that have been party to the case and to Spain, Chile and countries like France, Belgium and Switzerland that have made extradition requests of their own. He is asking for answers back within a week.</p>
        <p>Patrick Robertson, a spokesman for General Pinochet, said he was delighted at the announcement. The general's principal lawyer, Michael Caplan, said only that it was ''a very important development in the case at this stage.''</p>
        <p>England's highest court, the Law Lords of the House of Lords, fundamentally altered the law of sovereign immunity when it threw out the general's claim that he could not be tried for acts during the time that he was a head of state. The court also established new international powers for people seeking redress of rights abuses, even in courts outside the country where crimes were alleged to have been committed.</p>
        <p>The point was reflected in the response of Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said today, ''Heads of state no longer enjoy impunity for crimes against humanity.''</p>
        <p>The medical tests held last week were scheduled after the Chilean Embassy submitted evidence in October from General Pinochet's doctors that his health had declined markedly. He was said to have suffered a series of small strokes in September.</p>
        <p>Mr. Straw then asked General Pinochet to consent to an independent examination, and his office selected the four doctors, specialists respectively in gerontology, geriatric medicine, neurology and neuropsychology. The seven-hour examination was conducted in Spanish -- General Pinochet does not speak English -- and two of the physicians, Mr. Straw said, were fluent in the language.</p>
        <p>He said that it was the ''unequivocal and unanimous'' conclusion ''that following recent deterioration in the state of Senator Pinochet's health, which seems to have occurred principally during September and October 1999, he is at present unfit to stand trial, and that no change to that position can be expected.''</p>
        <p>The general was originally arrested on Oct. 16, 1998, as he lay in a London clinic recuperating from back surgery. The British police made their surprise move in response to an application from a Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon. He asked for General Pinochet's extradition to Madrid to stand trial on charges of genocide, torture, kidnapping and murder in connection with the disappearance of more than 3,000 people in the 17 years after he seized power in a 1973 coup.</p>
        <p>Judge Garzon, considered something of a maverick in the Spanish judiciary, had gathered his evidence during an investigation into the so-called dirty wars in Latin America in the 1970's. The Spanish Government, forced by circumstance to pursue the case, has shown little enthusiasm for it and tonight Spain's Foreign Ministry said it would ''respect the decisions of the British Government.''</p>
        <p>General Pinochet won his first legal battle to overcome the charges when the High Court upheld his claim to sovereign immunity. But in a ruling that was to create the case's legacy, the Law Lords overturned that decision, saying that being a head of state did not excuse crimes against humanity.</p>
        <p>The case returned to the House of Lords after one of the original judges was found to have had an association with Amnesty International, a party to the case. But the second Lords' decision was even more emphatic on the principle than the first one, though it reduced the number of charges and narrowed the scope to torture and conspiracy to torture.</p>
        <p>The case then moved on to the validity of the extradition order itself. It was upheld by a London magistrate last October and then appealed, leading to a plan for another hearing on March 20.</p>
        <p>In the one appearance in court that General Pinochet has been obliged to make, he maintained the defiant attitude he adopted from the beginning, saying he did not recognize the jurisdiction of any court outside of one in Chile to try him and saying he was innocent of ''all the lies of Spain.''</p>
        <p>Every hearing and court date has seen crowds of supporters and opponents hurling taunts and jeers and holding aloft flags and placards with accusatory slogans and pictures of missing friends and relatives.</p>
        <p>For the last 13 months, the general has been living under house arrest with his wife, Lucia, in a rented mansion in one of London's exclusive southern suburbs. He had periodic visits from Chilean supporters and backers of his in this country, the most visible of whom has been former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Her office said tonight that she was delighted with the doctors' report and that she expected Mr. Straw to be a ''very fair man'' and order the general's freedom.</p>
        <p>Carlos Reyes, a former journalist imprisoned by the Pinochet government who speaks for a group representing Chileans abroad, said, ''It's unbelievable that a criminal should escape justice because perhaps he is ill.''</p>
        <p>But other opponents of General  Pinochet were more resigned to the apparent inconclusive end of the case. ''I am not surprised to hear this, and much as I regard Pinochet as a blood-soaked tyrant, if the doctors say he is unfit to stand trial then he is unfit to stand trial,'' said George Galloway, a Labor member of Parliament. ''It would be reducing ourselves to Pinochet's level if we pursued the matter vindictively in the teeth of medical evidence.''</p>
