        <p>''On the Retirement Road, 65 Is Still Their Limit'' (Seniority, Jan. 2), by Fred Brock, suggested that raising the retirement age to 70 would be difficult for Americans whose jobs required hard physical labor -- construction workers, for example. The column drew varied responses from readers.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I think your conclusion is correct that the people making the rules (a small minority) don't need to retire on Social Security as early as possible. They are in high-paying jobs that allow them to carry on with a minimum of pain and strain. That is not so with the vast majority of people.</p>

        <p>''On the Retirement Road, 65 Is Still Their Limit'' (Seniority, Jan. 2), by Fred Brock, suggested that raising the retirement age to 70 would be difficult for Americans whose jobs required hard physical labor -- construction workers, for example.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I think your conclusion is correct that the people making the rules (a small minority) don't need to retire on Social Security as early as possible. They are in high-paying jobs that allow them to carry on with a minimum of pain and strain. That is not so with the vast majority of people.</p>
        <p>I happen to be in another well-hidden class of people. I hold a Ph.D. in chemistry and was forced to retire at the age of 53. Because of my age and the fact that I have 25-plus years of experience I am virtually unemployable. A company can hire a person straight out of graduate school for half what it would cost for a person with my experience. I have offered to work for the reduced amount, but it does no good since they feel that I will keep looking for another job and leave at the first opportunity.</p>
        <p>I receive about $14,000 in pension benefits from my old company. The bottom line is simple. I can't support my wife and 17-year-old daughter on my current income.</p>
        <p>I think there are a lot of people in the same position. I paid the maximum into Social Security for the first 25 years of my working life, because I was making a high salary. Now that I'm making much less money, my contribution is far lower. I wonder if I will ever get anything out.</p>
