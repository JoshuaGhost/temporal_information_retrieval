        <p>Officials, health workers and nightclub owners have been arguing for months over developing a municipal policy to get the denizens of the freewheeling night life mecca here to obtain and use condoms.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the West Hollywood City Council approved a plan to give 320,000 free condoms this year to 33 gay bars, which would voluntarily supply the condoms to their clientele. But, feeling the step insufficient, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which treats 5,000 patients throughout the Los Angeles area, has proposed a competing initiative that would ask West Hollywood voters to make the program apply to all bars in the city and would require participation.</p>

        <p>Officials, health workers and nightclub owners have been arguing for months over developing a municipal policy to get the denizens of the freewheeling night life mecca here to obtain and use condoms.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the West Hollywood City Council approved a plan to give 320,000 free condoms this year to 33 gay bars, which would voluntarily supply the condoms to their clientele. But, feeling the step insufficient, the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which treats 5,000 patients throughout the Los Angeles area, has proposed a competing initiative that would ask West Hollywood voters to make the program apply to all bars in the city and would require participation.</p>
        <p>''It's about protecting the public health,'' said Michael Weinstein, the foundation's president. ''Not only the public health in H.I.V. transmission, but unwanted pregnancy and other sexually transmitted diseases. We're in an epidemic in West Hollywood.''</p>
        <p>The toughest opponents may be the bar patrons themselves. To a man, customers at the gay discotheque Revolver said they were skeptical of government sponsorship of such programs.</p>
        <p>In part, the debate reveals much about the character of West Hollywood, a two-square-mile, 40,000-resident enclave flanked on three sides by Los Angeles and on the fourth by  Beverly Hills, which is is a premier night life destination known for its risque Halloween parade.</p>
        <p>The debate has not been about whether the program is right, but how extensive it should be.</p>
        <p>In West Hollywood, where roughly a third of the residents -- and many more of its club and bar patrons -- are gay men, there is concern over a return of promiscuity brought on by the success of protease inhibitors in treating H.I.V. and AIDS, combined with a new generation of less careful men.</p>
        <p>City officials and AIDS care workers note that although West Hollywood has only one-half of 1 percent of Los Angeles County's population, it has 7 percent of its AIDS cases. And, in data soon to be released as part of a nationwide study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, half of 548 men under age 30 surveyed in West Hollywood said they had had unprotected sex with other men in the previous six months.</p>
