        <p>After Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel decided to postpone a withdrawal from the West Bank due to take place later this week, senior Palestinian officials reacted today by condemning the Israelis, saying they were souring the relationship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak, who is scheduled to leave on Tuesday for Washington to resume peace talks with Syria, told his cabinet today that he would attend to the land transfer on his return. Officials said the Prime Minister had not had sufficient time to review the maps and present them to his cabinet for approval before leaving.</p>
        <p>Coupled with that explanation, Mr. Barak's postponement heightened Palestinians' concerns that the Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations would adversely affect them. Some Palestinians fear that Israeli officials and American mediators will be distracted and that their peace track will be relegated to second-class status.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a senior Israeli official, in discussing the delay tonight, said, ''You have to take into consideration the Syrian track. It takes our energy.''</p>
        <p>The land transfer was supposed to take place on Thursday under the interim peace agreement signed last September in Sharm el Sheik, Egypt. It was to have been the third and final Israeli withdrawal under the interim agreement, giving the Palestinians full or partial control over about 40 percent of the West Bank.</p>
        <p>''This decision is totally rejected, and it is a blow to all our attempts to create a partnership,'' said Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian negotiator. He added that the Israelis did not consult with the Palestinians, despite regular talks between the two sides, but made a ''unilateral decision.''</p>
        <p>Israelis and Palestinians have been speculating that the Israeli government might include some Arab neighborhoods just outside Jerusalem in the next withdrawal. If true, this would make the land transfer a very sensitive political issue for Mr. Barak.</p>
        <p>In the view of many Israelis, giving back land near Jerusalem under the interim agreement would be premature since the final status of Jerusalem is under negotiation in the permanent peace talks.</p>
        <p>With Jerusalem as one of the most complex issues before them, Israelis and Palestinians are heading into an intensive period of negotiations to hammer out a framework agreement for final peace by Feb. 13. It is another deadline that may well end up being postponed.</p>
        <p>At different moments, both Israelis and Palestinians have accused each other of stalling the framework negotiations.</p>
        <p>In postponing this withdrawal, Mr. Barak seems to be inching closer to the position he put forth last summer -- that the third withdrawal should take place in mid-February. Before the Sharm el Sheik agreement was signed, Mr. Barak unsuccessfully tried to persuade Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to link the third withdrawal with the successful completion of a framework agreement.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arafat did not agree, and a Jan. 20 deadline was set for the third withdrawal. The prime minister's office said today that when the Sharm el Sheik agreement was signed, the Palestinians also verbally agreed that a three-week extension would be acceptable.</p>
        <p>''They wanted to make sure it happened before the framework agreement, and this will be the case,'' said Gadi Baltiansky, Mr. Barak's spokesman.</p>
        <p>''Barak doesn't intend to violate the Sharm agreement,'' he added. ''But Barak wants to see the overall picture first.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arafat is flying to the United States this week, too, to meet with President Clinton and to present him with the Palestinian outline for the final status. It is possible that there will also be a three-way meeting with the Israelis, to discuss where final negotiations stand.</p>
        <p>Israeli officials said Mr. Barak did not want to risk a miniature crisis with the Palestinians before that meeting, in the event there was a dispute about the territory Israel selected for the land transfer.</p>
        <p>The second withdrawal was significantly delayed because of a bitter disagreement over the maps, but took place earlier this month.</p>
