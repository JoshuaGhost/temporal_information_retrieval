        <p>When Roberto Cavalli's designs  were popular in the 1970's, Sally Marsh did not wear them, but she isn't missing the chance now that they have made a comeback. Passing the Roberto Cavalli boutique, which opened in September at 711 Madison Avenue (63rd Street), she found that the mannequins in feather-trimmed jeans, metallic print tops and painted leather jackets made her nostalgic for her wilder days in the 70's, when she was a publicist for a London nightclub.</p>
        <p>''It was bizarre and glitzy,'' Ms. Marsh, 46, said of the display, which included banners decorated with giant roses sewn out of candy-color paillettes.</p>

        <p>When Roberto Cavalli's designs  were popular in the 1970's, Sally Marsh did not wear them, but she isn't missing the chance now that they have made a comeback. Passing the Roberto Cavalli boutique, which opened in September at 711 Madison Avenue (63rd Street), she found that the mannequins in feather-trimmed jeans, metallic print tops and painted leather jackets made her nostalgic for her wilder days in the 70's, when she was a publicist for a London nightclub.</p>
        <p>''It was bizarre and glitzy,'' Ms. Marsh, 46, said of the display, which included banners decorated with giant roses sewn out of candy-color paillettes.</p>
        <p>''The whole store is a fantasy,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Now a casting agent for clothing catalogs and a producer of fashion shoots, Ms. Marsh said she and her colleagues have been buying up Cavalli's animal-inspired creations because they like the ''borderline tarty'' look.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, she wore the ensemble on the left -- gold stretch jeans printed to look like wolf fur (on sale for $234) and a matching velvet cardigan with a fox collar (on sale for $492) -- to a black-tie affair.</p>
        <p>She could hardly say she fitted in with the elegant crowd, Ms. Marsh remarked, ''But everyone thought it was really fun.''</p>
