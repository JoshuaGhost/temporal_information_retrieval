        <p>Often working the sidelines of the red carpet in New York and Los Angeles, Diane Clehane, a writer who covers fashion and entertainment, shrugs and smiles when she is asked whether her shoes are Manolo Blahniks or Jimmy Choos.</p>
        <p>''My mom always told me it's not what you wear, it's how you wear it,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clehane, who calls herself a ''shoe freak,'' owns 200 pairs. But many of her favorites are not from hot-name designers. Rather, they come from the Sears, Roebuck shoe department.</p>
        <p>''They must have thought I was Imelda Marcos last time I went to Sears,'' she said. At last count, she had 20 pairs of Sears shoes.</p>
        <p>While many fashion-conscious types may be under the impression that anything from Sears screams ''grandma style,'' the chain has made a serious effort to attract customers who pride themselves on a sharp style sensibility.</p>
        <p>Many Manhattanites are traveling to Sears stores in Kings Plaza in Brooklyn, in New Jersey and on Long Island to pick up designer knockoffs for under $40.</p>
        <p>A Sears buyer, Sue Hopper, said the chain's Apostrophe line was a big seller in stores in urban areas. ''We've made a real effort to be on the cutting edge,'' she said. The shoes, some made in Italy, bear some similarities to high-end Gucci and Prada styles.</p>
        <p>Keith Sherry Vine, a drag artist who performs regularly around the city, swears by Sears shoes. And it's not about kitsch. ''Sorry, Payless,'' he said, ''there's nothing like a Sears shoe for style. There's just no comparison.'' Many of his drag queen friends also wear them regularly because they are sturdy and look like designer shoes.</p>
        <p>''I own a pair of Thierry Mugler shoes, and they are sheer torture,'' Mr. Vine said. ''So I just covet them in their box.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Clehane is quick to point out that she owns quite a few pairs of beautiful and expensive designer shoes. But, she said, she can't always depend on her ''limo shoe'' when she is working. So when she was covering the red carpet at the Academy Awards last year, she wore a pair of Sears shoes. ''Quite a few celebrities inquired,'' she said.</p>
        <p>And at a recent tribute to Tom Hanks at the Waldorf-Astoria she wore a simple black Chanel dress she has owned for years and beaded black shoes from Sears. ''Rita Wilson, who's no fashion slouch, by the way, stopped me and asked if they were Manolos,'' Ms. Clehane said. ''I just laughed.''</p>
