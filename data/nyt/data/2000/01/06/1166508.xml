        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Bold Effort Leaves Much Unchanged for the Poor'' (front page, Dec. 30): Welfare reform is no panacea. After 35 years of handouts and helping hands, the poor are faced with the same intractable dilemma: With or without work, they still can't make ends meet. That's because as earned income rises, welfare benefits are taken away.</p>
        <p>Recognizing that welfare is the problem, there's a simple solution. Close down our social programs and return the savings to the people. Our studies have shown that there is enough money in the federal budget to provide a taxable annual rebate of $4,000 per adult and $2,000 per child. That's enough to turn even the lowest wage into a living wage while providing real tax relief for the middle class.</p>
