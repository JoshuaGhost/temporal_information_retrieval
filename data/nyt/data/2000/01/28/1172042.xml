        <p>Feature  530 West 25th Street  Chelsea  Through Feb. 4</p>
        <p>Like a cross between Kandinsky and Richard Tuttle, B. Wurtz's painting seems both cosmic and mundane. On loose, unprimed canvases that hang on the wall by loops of thread from plain nails, Mr. Wurtz has painted circles and straight lines with dry economy and has strategically sewn buttons onto the fabric. At first these works seem too unfinished and too slight to sustain interest, but they have a cheeky intelligence and a material presence that can grow on you.</p>

        <p>Feature  530 West 25th Street  Chelsea  Through Feb. 4</p>
        <p>Like a cross between Kandinsky and Richard Tuttle, B. Wurtz's painting seems both cosmic and mundane. On loose, unprimed canvases that hang on the wall by loops of thread from plain nails, Mr. Wurtz has painted circles and straight lines with dry economy and has strategically sewn buttons onto the fabric. At first these works seem too unfinished and too slight to sustain interest, but they have a cheeky intelligence and a material presence that can grow on you.</p>
        <p>Part of the interest is in the simple games the artist plays with his elemental vocabulary. In one picture, the painting is all black and white, while colored buttons are stitched to the centers of each floating circle. In another, a multicolored field of buttons drifts between two groups of glowing spheres in primary colors, each with a white button at its center. Looking at these compositions, one thinks of early Modernist pioneers who found intimations of spirituality in the archetypal elements of design. Mr. Wurtz turns that high-minded tradition into a hobbylike craft, democratically blurring the line between the exalted and the ordinary.</p>
