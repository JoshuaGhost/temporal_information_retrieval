        <p>Nolan/Eckman Gallery  560 Broadway, at Prince Street  SoHo  Through Feb. 5</p>
        <p>Since his death in 1997 at the age of 43, Martin Kippenberger's reputation has continued to soar in Europe, where he was a ubiquitous roustabout of contemporary art. In the United States, where he was less visible personally, he remains too little known despite his inclusion in the current Carnegie International.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is the scope of his output. Fueled by natural and chemically induced energy, he released a flood of no-two-alike objects. His work in every medium was both inventive and antivirtuosic. His refusal to settle on a signature style makes his career hard to pin down.</p>
        <p>There is probably no more manageable, small-scale way to approach him than through the drawings and collages in this show, which date from the last decade or so of his life. The drawings, mostly in pencil on hotel stationery that the artist collected in his travels, look like off-the-cuff sketches at first. But Kippenberger conceived them in thematic series (portraits of scientists, portraits of Frank Sinatra, depictions of war etc.), and they combine conceptual audacity with a sovereign, fine-tuned formal control.</p>
        <p>The collages are more complicated. They incorporate photographs (Polaroids, film stills, magazine clips), prints (one by Sigmar Polke), exhibition posters from past Kippenberger shows, some folded up origami-style, self-produced decals (''I Love Betty Ford Klinik,'' one reads) and photographed and rephotographed drawings.</p>
        <p>Imbedded with all this loquacity are poisonous darts directed at any number of cultural targets, including the artist's own self-punishing, perpetual-motion career. Perhaps an American museum will undertake a full-scale retrospective, with all the gathering and sorting such a project entails. Kippenberger may never come entirely into focus, but it sure would be great to have a whole lot of him in one place in this part of the world for a while.</p>
