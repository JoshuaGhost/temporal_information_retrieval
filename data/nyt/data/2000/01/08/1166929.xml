        <p>After 10 years of reporting sports news with a humorous yet politically incorrect edge, Mike Breen will leave WFAN Radio's Imus in the Morning Show on Jan. 19.</p>
        <p>''I've been thinking about this for some time, and my contract was up at the end of the year,'' Breen, who is also the TV voice of the Knicks on the MSG Network, said yesterday from Orlando, Fla.</p>
        <p>''The lifestyle was too much for me. I'm tired of being tired. I've become a professional napper. I've been getting sick. I got pneumonia. And I wanted to spend more time with my kids.''</p>
        <p>Breen said the occasional criticism that some of his remarks were offensive to ethnic groups and gays -- at odds with his very straightforward calls of Knicks and Women's National Basketball Association games for NBC Sports -- did not contribute to his decision to leave Don Imus's raucous program.</p>
        <p>Breen's reports are frequently delivered with out-of-context sound bites and complemented by contributions from members of Imus's cast.</p>
        <p>''If I thought anything I said was racist or mean, I wouldn't do it,'' Breen said.</p>
        <p>Imus said: ''I know he's sensitive to criticism, and some people called NBC or the N.B.A.Breen said he received no pressure from his employers to tone down his radio act.</p>
        <p>''It's not worth it for him,'' Imus said. ''His future is as a big-time sportscaster, not making fun of athletes on my program, and my advice is to pursue that.''</p>
