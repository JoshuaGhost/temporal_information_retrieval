        <p>Andrew Sullivan comment speculates that Ernestine Schlant, undemonstrative feminist and solid academic who is also Bill Bradley's wife, would be First Lady quite different from demure, perky appendages of other candidates; adds that Schlant is also the opposite of Hillary Clinton, who gave up her own career to seek marital alliance to wield power she could never have won on her own (M)</p>

        <p>Compare her with her rivals for first lady, and it's hard not to get a little excited about Ernestine Schlant. Compare her with Hillary Clinton, and it's hard not to get ecstatic. The wife of Bill Bradley, Schlant is an undemonstrative feminist, a mother of two (one of whom is from a previous marriage) and an academic with her own solid career. She has had the same simple, close-cropped haircut for 30 years. Her relationship with her husband seems devoid of any agenda but that of simple romance. When she met him, she was eight years his senior and barely knew what a New York Knick was. She has never even hinted at the idea of gaining political power through marriage, and yet she is anything but a demure or perky appendage to her lofty spouse. Barring an upset, she won't ever be first lady of the United States. But given what has happened to the East Wing of the White House in recent years, this is one small reason for hoping that upsets can happen.</p>
        <p>Everything about Schlant makes her a refreshing figure for the wife of a president. Unlike Tipper Gore and Laura Bush, she has not subsumed her own career into her husband's. Unlike Cindy McCain, she wasn't born privileged or wealthy. Unlike all her rivals, she is attractive rather than pretty, and at 64, with a mastectomy, elegantly subverts conventional notions of beauty. She is an immigrant, born in Nazi Germany, with a father who fought in Hitler's Luftwaffe but who was not, according to Schlant, a Nazi Party member. As a child, she delivered tea to wounded German soldiers in makeshift hospitals. She made her way to the United States in 1957 as a Pan Am flight attendant, before studying at Emory University, where she got her Ph.D. in comparative literature. She still has the traces of a light German accent, but her story is quintessentially American. It is one of immigration, self-reinvention and obsession with her roots.</p>

        <p>Compare her with her rivals for first lady, and it's hard not to get a little excited about Ernestine Schlant. Compare her with Hillary Clinton, and it's hard not to get ecstatic. The wife of Bill Bradley, Schlant is an undemonstrative feminist, a mother of two (one of whom is from a previous marriage) and an academic with her own solid career. She has had the same simple, close-cropped haircut for 30 years. Her relationship with her husband seems devoid of any agenda but that of simple romance. When she met him, she was eight years his senior and barely knew what a New York Knick was. She has never even hinted at the idea of gaining political power through marriage, and yet she is anything but a demure or perky appendage to her lofty spouse. Barring an upset, she won't ever be first lady of the United States. But given what has happened to the East Wing of the White House in recent years, this is one small reason for hoping that upsets can happen.</p>
        <p>Everything about Schlant makes her a refreshing figure for the wife of a president. Unlike Tipper Gore and Laura Bush, she has not subsumed her own career into her husband's. Unlike Cindy McCain, she wasn't born privileged or wealthy. Unlike all her rivals, she is attractive rather than pretty, and at 64, with a mastectomy, elegantly subverts conventional notions of beauty. She is an immigrant, born in Nazi Germany, with a father who fought in Hitler's Luftwaffe but who was not, according to Schlant, a Nazi Party member. As a child, she delivered tea to wounded German soldiers in makeshift hospitals. She made her way to the United States in 1957 as a Pan Am flight attendant, before studying at Emory University, where she got her Ph.D. in comparative literature. She still has the traces of a light German accent, but her story is quintessentially American. It is one of immigration, self-reinvention and obsession with her roots.</p>
        <p>Other candidates for first lady have had their ''issues,'' from planting flowers in public parks to the ''war on drugs.'' Laura Bush has safely adopted her mother-in-law's literacy campaign. Tipper Gore is an advocate for the mentally ill. Cindy McCain is an expert on children's health. Schlant's issue is the Holocaust, and coming to terms with it. She didn't adopt it late in life, as a way of complementing her husband's political career. She took it on from the beginning of her adult consciousness because it challenged to the core her own identity, even her family's moral integrity. She took it on because her own father's somewhat muddled denials of knowledge of the Holocaust forced her to confront her own and her homeland's responsibility for the greatest crime in history.</p>
        <p>Maybe I'm a sap for intellectuals, but there's surely something quietly impressive about this. Her book, ''The Language of Silence: West German Literature and the Holocaust,'' was clearly written with no possible political motive in mind. You have to read deep into the acknowledgments and notice who took the author photograph to figure out who her husband is. The book itself is an unsparing analysis of West German literature from the end of World War II to reunification and exempts very few writers from the charge of avoidance and denial in their treatment of the Jewish catastrophe. Schlant wants more than ritual regret about the past; she wants empathy, remembrance, engagement, penance. Silence is a form of speech, she argues. It is ''constituted by the absence of words but is therefore and simultaneously the presence of their absence.''</p>
        <p>The cover of her book is her own photograph of a Holocaust memorial at the Grunewald train station in Berlin, the station where many Jews departed for their deaths. The memorial is a long concrete wall, with figures carved out of it, empty human spaces who look as if they are walking to catch a train, symbols of people once here and now gone forever.</p>
        <p>There are times, to be sure, when she overstates her case. A telling review in The New Republic pointed out how some postwar German writers may not have been able to convey detailed depictions of Jews because they didn't know many. The Holocaust had already done its hideous work. Schlant criticizes West Germans' engaged response to the broadcast of the American miniseries ''Holocaust'' in 1979 as overly self-absorbed. But would it have been better had they ignored the miniseries altogether? She accuses the author Heinrich Boll of ''unconscious'' anti-Semitism. But can bigotry be unconscious and still be blameworthy? There are times indeed when her unrelenting moral demands of her former countrymen resonate rather closely with her husband's disdain for many Americans on the subject of race. ''That's why we love each other,'' Bradley told The Washington Post. ''There's this 'Let's go deeper, let's go deeper.' ''</p>
        <p>But these are quibbles. Reading Schlant's book, I find it hard not to think of Hillary Rodham Clinton's ''It Takes a Village.'' Perhaps it's an unfair comparison -- one a deeply serious work of scholarship, the other a potboiler designed for political gain. But what Schlant reminds us is that marriage to a politician need not mean marriage to politics. It's odd, but this very basic tenet of feminism has come to seem alien in America in the age of Clinton. Like Cherie Blair's in Britain, Schlant's politics may well echo her husband's, but her career is utterly separate, her achievements completely admirable in their own right.</p>
        <p>When you look at Hillary Clinton, you see a corruption of feminism in which a woman forsakes her own career and seeks a marital alliance to wield power she could have never won on her own. When you look at Laura Bush or Tipper Gore or Cindy McCain, you see throwbacks to another era. You see talented and able women who are still wedded in public to the identity of their husbands, women who would most likely perform the role of first lady in the mold of Barbara Bush or Nancy Reagan: adjunct spouse and national matriarch. But when you look at Schlant, you see the potential for something much more interesting and subversive. You see a first lady with the potential to become a first woman.</p>
        <p>Given the marginal ideological differences between most of the candidates, this strikes me as a genuine, if overlooked, issue on the table. We have in this election a subplot with real traction in the culture war. Of course, it would be yet another corruption of feminism to vote for Bradley in the hope of getting Ernestine, but other things being equal, a quiet assertion of feminist principles wouldn't be such a bad development come the fall. Perhaps, by her mere presence in the East Wing, Schlant would do what true feminism would dictate in the first place and abolish the role of first lady altogether. Perhaps she would do what the spouses of Western European premiers do and aim to conduct her career independently, live somewhere other than the White House some of the time and delegate the social duties to others.</p>
        <p>I'm dreaming, of course. But isn't that what Bill Bradley has said he wants us all to do? One of the quiet but powerful messages of his candidacy is not simply the appeal of the un-Clinton, but the appeal of the un-Rodham too. Sign me up for the latter, before it really is too late.</p>
