        <p>ON a 4,025-mile tour through America's heartland, Yoshi Higa dodged wild animals, weathered violent storms and endured 104-degree heat -- all from the precarious vantage point of a bicycle seat.</p>
        <p>But to the art and photography professor from Long Island University's Southampton College, the cross-country solo bike tour was more than a test of endurance. It was his 60th birthday celebration.</p>
        <p>''I see 60 as a turning point,'' Mr. Higa said. ''So I wanted a challenge. I wanted to do something outrageous and crazy.''</p>
        <p>Mission accomplished.</p>
        <p>He did nothing to prepare his body for the journey, took no maps, guidebooks or cell phone. The only belongings he carried along were a sleeping bag, tent, a change of clothes and his cameras.</p>
        <p>Traveling alone on long, lonely highways made him vulnerable to rattlesnakes and wild dogs (he outpaced them by pedaling furiously) and the forces of nature, like the torrents of rain and snow. Yet it also brought him closer to the scenery he sought. Instead of whizzing by in a car or tour bus, he could linger over any flower or weed that struck his fancy.</p>
        <p>He also discovered the American landscape.</p>
        <p>''This country is so beautiful,'' said Mr. Higa, whose tour took him into 13 states and 2 Canadian provinces. ''In some places, it is a very wild landscape that looks like the surface of the moon. In other places there were snow-covered mountains or farmland. Since I was on a bike, I felt more attached to the ground. I saw beautiful light and clouds. I saw the road. I saw a lot of small things close up; the wildlife, flowers, trees and grass.''</p>
        <p>A photographer whose work has been published in Life magazine and displayed at the Museum of Modern Art, Mr. Higa captured his daily observations from the road with three Nikon cameras and 150 rolls of film. He will share his awe for the American panorama with viewers of his exhibition, ''Across America,'' at the Southampton College Avram Art Gallery through March 7.</p>
        <p>Among the prints through which non-cyclists can relive Mr. Higa's three-month odyssey are scenes of the snow-capped peaks of the Cascade Mountains outside Seattle, a child bathing in Lake Erie and Mr. Higa's shadow self-portrait in a vast field of flowers in Montana.</p>
        <p>He launched his journey on May 17 from Anacortes, just north of Seattle, crossed the Cascades and puffed his way 5,575 feet up the snow-covered Sherman Pass. Then he climbed the Rocky Mountains, followed rail tracks through Big Sky country, rode alongside the Mississippi River and the Great Lakes and then through the Finger Lakes region and Catskill Mountains. In mid-August, he rolled through the gates of Southampton College, where he was received with a marching band and cheers from colleagues and students.</p>
        <p>Mr. Higa, who got his first bicycle as a teenager, was never much of a sportsman. After leaving Japan, he did not own a bicycle until he was in his 50's, when he bought a bicycle to ride in a charity bike-a-thon. The last time he did any cycling was eight years ago when he rode 1,000 miles to raise money for Southampton College's photography department.</p>
        <p>Despite the sporadic nature of his cycling experience, the gray-haired optimist with the slight, unathletic frame didn't bother training for the rigors of the road. ''That came during the trip,'' he said. ''I just started out slow.'' To Mr. Higa, slow meant pedaling 50 miles a day at 12 miles per hour instead of 100 miles a day, as he did toward the end of his trip.</p>
        <p>At times, his shoulders ached so much he could barely grasp his camera to shoot a scene. ''I could hold onto the handlebars but that was it,'' he said. Nonetheless, with magnificent scenery surrounding him, his mood remained nearly as high as the mountains he photographed. ''I felt great,'' he said. ''I felt strong.''</p>
        <p>He spent nights at makeshift campsites and motels and rarely dismounted from the pedals during the day, unless it was to snap a picture, sketch a scene or eat. He dined on oatmeal, fruit, nuts and, at the occasional local restaurant, ''too much meat and potatoes,'' he said, grumbling that it was hard to find his typical diet of fish and vegetables during much of his journey.</p>
        <p>When the road seemed long and endless, what often kept him going was sheer curiosity. ''I thought, 'Gee, I wonder what is coming next,' '' he recalled. ''I had no idea because I didn't read any guidebooks.''</p>
        <p>What also kept him pedaling were the people he encountered. There were young children who chased after his bike with questions, adults who cheered him on, strangers who offered him refuge during rainstorms and bartenders who learned of his wild venture and promptly offered drinks on the house.</p>
        <p>''Before I left, a lot of people told me to carry a gun and said I would need two cell phones in case one got stolen,'' Mr. Higa said. ''I didn't need any of those.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''I discovered how helpful and kind people in this country are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Higa's marathon across America was inspired by more than the camera lens, sketch pad and desire for craziness. He also sought to raise money for the arts and media department at Southampton College, where he has taught since 1977. Though pledges and sponsors, he succeeded in raising more than $8,500.</p>
        <p>Growing up on a farm in Okinawa, Mr. Higa aspired to be an artist from his early teens and spent his spare moments sketching landscapes. He studied fine arts at Tama Art University in Tokyo and, in 1964, decided to move to New York because it was the center for contemporary art. Although Mr. Higa was penniless, spoke no English and knew no one in New York, he was undaunted. He took whatever work he could find -- handcrafting, carpentry and freelance art projects. Eventually, he earned degrees from Columbia University and Pratt Graphic Center, where he met his wife, Madeleine Lewis, also an artist. The couple live in lower Manhattan and Hampton Bays.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewis, whom Mr. Higa occasionally called from the road to get directions, had no doubts about her husband's ability to survive the bike-a-thon.</p>
        <p>''When he first told me his idea, I told him he was crazy,'' she said. ''But I knew he could do it. He has always had wild ideas, but whenever he says he's going to do something, he does it. He has lots of internal strength.''</p>
        <p>His adventure has since inspired others. ''People say they get energy and courage from me,'' Mr. Higa said. ''I say, 'Anyone can do this.' ''</p>
        <p>His friends advise him not to stop now. They needn't worry. Mr. Higa is already thinking ahead.</p>
        <p>''Now I want to run,'' he said, adding that he ran his first five-mile race in Central Park several weeks ago.</p>
        <p>Is a 4,025-mile cross-country run in the works for his next birthday? Mr. Higa grinned. ''I'll see how far I can go,'' he said.</p>
