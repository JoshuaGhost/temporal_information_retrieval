        <p>The announcement in November 1999 of the Suffolk County area code change to 631 has been a joke perpetrated by the telephone company on the residents.

        <p>The announcement in November 1999 of the Suffolk County area code change to 631 has been a joke perpetrated by the telephone company on the residents. We had our stationery reprinted, our millennium calendars sent out with the new area code and our business cards redone. But attempting to dial our office from around the country simply results in a constant busy signal.</p>
        <p>Recently we had a problem with one of our office telephone lines and reported it to the Bell Atlantic automated repair service, which requests that you report the number in trouble by dialing into their system the area code and phone number that is in trouble. Upon doing this, we got an automated answer that we had used an invalid area code -- 631.</p>
        <p>When confronted with the problem, Bell employees offered replies ranging from ''we have no idea of the change of area code in Suffolk to 631'' to ''the switching has not been taken care of yet.''</p>
        <p>I rue the day in March when the unprepared Bell system ends the grace period for using 516 to dial Suffolk County phone numbers.</p>
