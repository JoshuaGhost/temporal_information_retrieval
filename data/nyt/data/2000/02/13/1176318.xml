        <p>In his  nonthreatening but persuasive way, David Stern laid down an ultimatum tonight. Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner, all but begged the city of Houston to help finance a new arena for the Rockets by 2003, or else.</p>

        <p>In his  nonthreatening but persuasive way, David Stern laid down an ultimatum tonight. Stern, the National Basketball Association commissioner, all but begged the city of Houston to help finance a new arena for the Rockets by 2003, or else.</p>
        <p>''I think it's more than probable'' that the Rockets would change cities without a new arena, Stern said at his annual news conference at the All-Star Game. ''I think it's certain the team will be relocated.''</p>
        <p>The comments came in response to the uncertainty about the franchise; in a referendum last fall, voters in Houston turned down a measure for the city to pay half the cost of a new arena. Stern also said that Houston, or any other current N.B.A. city, would not be in line for an expansion franchise should the city lose its team in the next few years.</p>
        <p>''The chances for an expansion team going to Houston are nonexistent,'' Stern said. He added, ''N.B.A. owners are not going to be an impediment to a Houston move at such time as their lease is over, because by then every single N.B.A. team will be in a renovated or new building and their building will not be adequate for the N.B.A.''</p>
        <p>The Rockets would move only if plans are not in place for a new arena when their lease on the Compaq Center expires after the 2002-3 season, Stern said.</p>
        <p>Stern also said Las Vegas would not be considered a viable expansion city as long as it carried league games in its sports books. Other cities mentioned as expansion possibilities were Memphis, Louisville, Ky., San Diego and New Orleans.</p>
        <p>Stern and his deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, discussed a range of topics, including the effectiveness of  the league's new drug program. In particular, Granik addressed the fact that all players were tested for marijuana in training camp for the first time last fall. The New York Times reported last week that 12 of 430 active players tested positive for the drug after the first tests.</p>
        <p>''I think it does appear that some of the speculation about how many players would test positive was substantially exaggerated,'' Granik said without discussing numbers. He added: ''Some people have said, 'Well, since everybody knows that they're being tested, it's easy to avoid testing positive.' But I think with marijuana, in particular, that's not necessarily so, because it can stay in your system for a number of months. And I think for the most part, the players in the N.B.A. have gotten the message.''</p>
        <p>Stern also announced that the league had reached agreement with its referees on a four-year contract next season that includes raises of roughly 10 percent per season. N.B.A. referees will remain the highest-paid officials in professional sports. Currently, the referees make from $85,000 to $250,000, based on experience.</p>
        <p>Stern also ruled that Dennis Rodman would have to find another place to live. The league said Rodman would have to move out of the guest house he is renting for $3,000 a month from the Dallas Mavericks' prospective owner, Mark Cuban. The agreement violates salary cap rules, the league said.</p>
        <p>Rodman signed with Dallas earlier this month and played his first game last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''Those kinds of arrangements are just prohibited,'' Granik said. ''So I think in due course Mr. Rodman will be moving out. But it's not a major crime that was committed.''</p>
        <p>A Healthy O'Neal Dominates</p>
        <p>He occupied the farthest corner of the hotel ballroom, away from the madness encompassing Kevin Garnett or Vince Carter. You cannot keep a low profile at 7 feet 1 inch and 320 pounds. But Shaquille O'Neal tried Friday afternoon, attracting less attention from reporters than some of his more acrobatic peers did.</p>
        <p>Asked if he was surprised about not being asked to participate in the dunk contest, he laughed and said, ''They didn't want me to win it.''</p>
        <p>On the surface, it is the same old Shaq. Cornball humor. Life of the party. A man who is said to be renting an entire hotel this weekend for a grand total of $700,000. But beyond O'Neal's extravagances and carefree attitude off the floor, he is a different kind of player this season.</p>
        <p>He moves his feet better on defense, helping out and playing with passion on both ends. And he keeps extending the range on that pretty little jump hook, enough so that you wonder why he just does not start shooting his free throws that way.</p>
        <p>He is averaging more than three blocked shots a game, double his output last season. In 12 games this season, he has scored more than 30 points and grabbed 15 rebounds. Second in scoring, first in field-goal percentage, he is playing on a Lakers team that has dabbled with the league's best record.</p>
        <p>If this keeps up and he overcomes his team's recent string of being swept out of the playoffs, a most valuable player award may be in the offing. Only Tim Duncan, Kevin Garnett, Grant Hill, Alonzo Mourning or Jason Kidd can compete.</p>
        <p>You can credit Coach Phil Jackson, O'Neal's injury-free status or the lack of many bona fide centers to contain such an awesome force. But maybe that little, fragile Shaq action figure is growing up into a bona fide superhero, the self-proclaimed Man of Steel he always wanted to be. Maybe O'Neal is less sensitive about criticism and more secure about his game and his goals?</p>
        <p>''I think you're reaching a little bit,'' he said, laughing. ''You just make that stuff up or they tell you to write that? Honestly, I'm healthy. That is a big thing.''</p>
        <p>Of playing for Jackson, he added: ''Obviously, he's a great coach. He never gives me any room to slack off. He expects a lot out of me; I expect a lot out of myself. We don't have a problem and I'm sure we'll never have a problem. I don't have a problem with respecting authority.''</p>
        <p>Knee injuries robbed him of 31 games in 1996-97, his first season with the Lakers. A strained abdominal muscle, small but intensely painful, knocked him out of 22 games in the 1997-98 season. He missed just one game last year in the lockout-shortened season, but that abdominal strain never healed completely.</p>
        <p>In the past O'Neal was not committed to protecting the paint and providing a safety net for teammates. He was not rebounding aggressively enough. He often forced shots way out of his range.</p>
        <p>''Now, there's no stopping him,'' his teammate Rick Fox said. ''None whatsoever. The Diesel is just too big, strong and skilled.''</p>
        <p>Coaches at Carlesimo's Place</p>
        <p>They began rounding the corner in the North Beach section of San Francisco on Thursday night, filing in, one by one. Chuck Daly. Mike Fratello. Brendan Malone and his wife, Maureen. Fred Carter, the former 76ers coach, now an ESPN analyst. And a truckload of news media types, all kibitzing about the state of the league. Dick Harter, the Indiana assistant coach, was supposed to show after watching the Stanford game 45 minutes away.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, P. J. Carlesimo's recently opened restaurant had morphed into a venerable coach's corner.</p>
        <p>''All that was missing from the night was Jack Ramsay jogging down the middle of the street, saying, 'Hi guys,' '' Malone, a Knicks assistant coach, said. ''My wife and I were on our way back to the hotel when we decided to stop in. It turned into a great night, almost serendipitous. It was like Runyon's West.''</p>
        <p>Since being relieved as coach at Golden State before the new year, Carlesimo has been putting much of his time into the restaurant with his partner and friend, Bobby Mulhern, hence the name, P. J. Mulhern's. But Carlesimo has made it clear this past week working as an analyst: he wants to coach again.</p>
        <p>''I miss it; of course, I miss it,'' Carlesimo said. ''It's what I do.''</p>
        <p>Malone said: ''He's a lifer. He has a passion for the game.''</p>
        <p>Carlesimo has often been branded as taskmaster. But to see him working the room on Thursday night was to see a genuinely relaxed man enjoying the company of good food and friends.</p>
        <p>With the All-Star Game in town and Carlesimo having no role with the Warriors, there was something right about some of the coaching fraternity showing their support for one of their own. Of course, a free gourmet meal and merlot probably didn't hurt matters.</p>
        <p>Just the same, once a coach. . . .</p>
        <p>''I went up to Adolph Rupp at the Garden once in the late 1970's after he had retired,'' Malone said. ''I said, 'Baron, I always wanted to meet you.' He was watching a game, I think it was Providence-Kentucky during a Christmas tournament.</p>
        <p>''I asked him what it felt like to give up coaching. He told me, 'It's like losing a wife.' Then I asked him what he was doing at that game. 'I'm looking and I'm learning,' he said. He was 81 years old.''</p>
