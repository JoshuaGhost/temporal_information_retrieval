        <p>AFTER a few visits to the Freelance Cafe and Wine Bar, you begin to realize that what seems simply casual is in fact meticulously orchestrated. The Freelance Cafe, which started in 1989, is part of Xaviar's restaurant group, a no-reservations, no-dress-code contrast to two fine-dining establishments named Xaviar's (one next door and the other in a country club in Garrison, N.Y., offering weekend wine dinners) plus an enormous chophouse called Restaurant X in Congers, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Such a place as this could easily get away with filling its assigned role without necessarily taking on a life of its own. In fact, New Jersey and New York are littered with small places that combine the foods and attitudes of American cafes, French bistros and Italian trattorias. But how many of them feature local artwork that changes every couple of months, offer small and large plates instead of appetizers and entrees, or make a point of serving dinner at the bar?</p>

        <p>AFTER a few visits to the Freelance Cafe and Wine Bar, you begin to realize that what seems simply casual is in fact meticulously orchestrated. The Freelance Cafe, which started in 1989, is part of Xaviar's restaurant group, a no-reservations, no-dress-code contrast to two fine-dining establishments named Xaviar's (one next door and the other in a country club in Garrison, N.Y., offering weekend wine dinners) plus an enormous chophouse called Restaurant X in Congers, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Such a place as this could easily get away with filling its assigned role without necessarily taking on a life of its own. In fact, New Jersey and New York are littered with small places that combine the foods and attitudes of American cafes, French bistros and Italian trattorias. But how many of them feature local artwork that changes every couple of months, offer small and large plates instead of appetizers and entrees, or make a point of serving dinner at the bar?</p>
        <p>All this is the work of Peter Xaviar Kelly, his brother Ned and his knowledgeable bartender, Michael Cimino. Ned and Michael have mastered the arts of accommodating guests, and thanks to a stint in sommelier school, of selecting wine.</p>
        <p>The subtitle of this place is, after all, Wine Bar and the list of 800 entries more than justifies that. Diners can choose wines from the Old and New Worlds at reasonable prices, and Mr. Cimino can help differentiate among several vintages from one vineyard. He will also offer a taste of one of 10 daily wines by the glass, accompanied by a water chaser.</p>
        <p>The food is as fine and as varied as the rest of the Freelance Cafe. It is hard to resist any of the small plates, like crisp, succulent coconut shrimp, lightly fried and served with a piquant mustard sauce. The crabmeat dumplings were also a winner, resting in a Thai carrot and ginger broth that I would gladly spoon over a main course. I'd do the same with the roasted garlic soup, studded with moist slivers of roasted chicken.</p>
        <p>The smoked chicken and fontina quesadilla and the lobster sausage with red pepper and watercress sauce were less compelling than the other small plates. The quesadilla needed a sprig of green cilantro for zest and color, and the lobster sausage, while healthily steamed in plastic wrap, cried out for a crisp crust to offset the mealiness of the ground meat. But two specials drew me back in. The Belgian endive salad with Roquefort and walnuts was tart, creamy and crunchy, its long, julienned strips of apple and endive adding a playful but elegant touch. And the perfectly caramelized bay scallops, cradled in a phyllo basket, were held in place by a bed of spinach and spiked with a refreshing orange beurre blanc.</p>
        <p>The large plates were large indeed, and given the variety of small plates, it would be hard to settle for just one entree, regardless of its size. For example, one special featured a whole, tender rainbow trout with a bowl of vegetable-studded basmati rice, a container of sauce, and a full serving of snow peas and carrots. It was a lot to take in. The Pacific ahi tuna with wasabi and seaweed salad was also intimidatingly hefty. Slicing it into more manageable bites could make the dish more appealing.</p>
        <p>There were a few dishes, though, that I would eat every last bite of no matter what the size. The pan-roasted chicken with parsley risotto was one. I enjoyed the crisp, salty skin, the smooth, green rice and the hidden nuggets of orange zest that teased me to find every last strip. All the components of the loin of lamb with layered Maxime potatoes, broccoli rape and roasted mushrooms were expertly cooked and worked well together. The steak au poivre with leaf spinach and mashed potatoes came with a thinner sauce than typical (and, happily, with less cream) and the spaghetti with soft zucchini, grana and butter was as simple and calming as a meal at home.</p>
        <p>Look for the pecan-diamond petits fours -- perfect caramel bundles -- before your dessert arrives. Ned should be passing them around on a silver tray. I would highly recommend the almond tuiles with fresh fruit and sorbet; the pear and raspberry versions are excellent, sprinkled with delicately diced strawberries, cantaloupe and blueberries. The special, a chestnut soup with caramel ice cream, was rather gritty, though creative as a sweet take on an item that is normally savory. The warm baked square of Callebaut chocolate, wrapped in phyllo with crunchy rice noodles on top, was puzzling: while it may have been a play on a Nestle's Crunch bar, its flavors and textures just didn't come together. The creme brulee, the chocolate souffle cake and the chocolate pecan tart were all satisfactory but none particularly stood out.</p>
        <p>THE word ''freelance'' suggests that Mr. Kelly knew that his clientele would surely include an interesting mix of artists, musicians and writers. Yet he also envisioned a broader interpretation of the word. Mr. Kelly wanted to have a free hand himself in the kitchen, to work with a diverse array of foods ranging from signature dishes (like French onion soup) to au courant items such as grana cheese. Similarly, he felt that his artistic clientele should be able to float from one region or style of food -- or even one way of dining -- to another: to experiment with Mr. Kelly at his restaurant as they do in their own lives.</p>
        <p>I can't think of a better theme to tie the primary ingredients of a restaurant together.</p>
