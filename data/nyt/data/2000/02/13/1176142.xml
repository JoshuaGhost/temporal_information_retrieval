        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jon Pareles has it right when he says, ''People buy discs, or trade MP3 files, not to accumulate goods but to hear the music they want when they want it'' [''Post Mergers: A Modest Proposal,'' Feb. 7].</p>
        <p>He is also correct when he notes that ''musicians have to be paid. . . . They could collect royalties based on how many times their songs had been played.'' However, his modest proposal already has a working model in the way authors of music (composers, lyricists, songwriters -- and their publishers) have been licensing the performance of musical works for 150 years. They do it through ''copyright collectives'' called performing right societies.</p>
        <p>Performing right societies don't provide physical copies of particular works. Rather, they grant ''blanket licenses'' to music users to use (that is, to perform or communicate) any of the musical works in their repertories. Virtually every country has a performing right organization (the United States has three in Ascap, BMI and Sesac). Reciprocal agreements between these international organizations insure that the world's authors are licensed in each country on a similar basis.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, authors and publishers of musical works are compensated when their copyrights are publicly performed. Music-use royalties are paid based on a census, survey or proxy analysis of that use. As tracking technology improves, so does the analysis. Now, record companies and performers are asserting a similar right to those long held by copyright owners of musical works.</p>
