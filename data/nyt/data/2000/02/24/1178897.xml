        <p>Mrs. Neuberger, a Democrat, served in the Senate from 1961 until January 1967.

        <p>Maurine Brown Neuberger, an Oregon teacher who became the third woman elected to the United States Senate and was an early consumer advocate, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Portland, her hometown. She was 93.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Neuberger, a Democrat, served in the Senate from 1961 until January 1967. She was expected to run for re-election in 1966 but decided against it, mainly, she said, because of the amount of money she would have to raise to campaign; she estimated it would cost ''well over $250,000.''</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Neuberger entered the Senate, her only female colleague was Margaret Chase Smith of Maine, a Republican who was elected to the Senate in 1948 and served until 1973. (The first woman to serve in the Senate was Hattie Wyatt Caraway, an Arkansas Democrat who was appointed to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband, Thaddeus, in 1931; she subsequently won a special election in 1932 and was re-elected twice, serving until 1945.)</p>
        <p>Mrs. Neuberger was the widow of Senator Richard L. Neuberger, who died in 1960, but she was not appointed to fill his unexpired term. Instead, she ran in the general election and won, saying she would follow her husband's path as a liberal Democrat but with a mind of her own.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Neuberger devoted much of her efforts to consumer issues. She sponsored one of the first bills to mandate health-warning labels on cigarette packages and wrote a book highly critical of the tobacco industry, ''Smoke Screen: Tobacco and the Public Welfare'' (1963).</p>
        <p>She urged pollution controls for automobiles years before meaningful action was taken. Cosmetic manufacturers drew her scorn for charging buyers more for fancy packaging and advertising than for the product itself; she herself did with just a touch of lipstick.</p>
        <p>''No industry I know of has ever been able to regulate itself to the interest of the consumer public,'' Mrs. Neuberger declared.</p>
        <p>After leaving the Senate, Mrs. Neuberger taught American government at Boston University and Radcliffe College for two years before returning to Oregon. There she tutored Portland elementary school pupils in reading and arithmetic until she was well into her 80's.</p>
        <p>Maurine Brown was born on Jan. 9, 1907, in Cloverdale, Ore., into a family of pioneers. She studied at the Oregon College of Education and graduated from the University of Oregon in 1929. After taking graduate courses at the University of California at Los Angeles, she taught high school English and physical education in Oregon public schools.</p>
        <p>She was married in 1945 after Richard Lewis Neuberger, then a young writer interested in politics and government, finished his wartime service as an Army captain. Already active in precinct politics and civic programs, she campaigned for Mr. Neuberger when he won election to the Oregon Senate in 1948.</p>
        <p>She herself entered the State House of Representatives two years later. That earned the Neubergers a footnote in political handbooks as the nation's first husband and wife to serve simultaneously in two chambers of a state legislature.</p>
        <p>The couple also worked together as freelance writers, collaborating on articles about the Pacific Northwest. They also wrote a book, ''Adventures in Politics: We Go to the Legislature'' (Oxford, 1954).</p>
        <p>Mrs. Neuberger astonished Oregonians when she took on the powerful dairy industry and a state law, backed by dairy interests, that banned the sale of margarine with yellow coloring. Putting on an apron and using a mixing bowl, she showed her House colleagues, all men, how to color the pale butter substitute. After that, the ban was lifted.</p>
        <p>The Neubergers served in the Oregon Legislature until 1955, when Mr. Neuberger moved to Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>There are no immediate survivors.</p>
        <p>Correction:  February 25, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Maurine Neuberger of Oregon, the third woman elected to the Senate, referred incorrectly to the precedent set by an earlier senator, Hattie Wyatt Caraway. She was the first woman elected to the Senate, not the first to serve there. The first to be seated -- though for only one day -- was Rebecca Latimer Felton; she was appointed.</p>
