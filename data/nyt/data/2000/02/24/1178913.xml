        <p>Both Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley are viewed favorably by registered Democrats who are likely to vote in New York's presidential primary election next month, but Mr. Gore to a greater degree than Mr. Bradley, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.</p>
        <p>When asked to choose between them, twice as many people said they were likely to vote for Mr. Gore instead of Mr. Bradley.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore is viewed favorably by 48 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, while 13 percent hold an unfavorable view of him. Mr. Bradley is viewed favorably by 28 percent, while 14 percent hold unfavorable opinions. The remainder in both cases said they were undecided or had not yet heard enough about the candidate to express an opinion.</p>
        <p>The new poll interviewed 1,897 adults throughout New York State, of whom 542 said they were registered as Democrats and would definitely or probably vote in the primary on March 7. The margin of sampling error for the latter group is plus or minus five percentage points.</p>
        <p>When asked whom they would vote for if the New York Democratic presidential primary were held today, 59 percent said they would vote for Mr. Gore, while 28 percent said they would vote for Mr. Bradley. But half of Bradley supporters and 4 in 10 Gore supporters said their minds were not entirely made up.</p>
        <p>The telephone poll was taken from Feb. 16 to 22, the third week after the New Hampshire primary, which Mr. Gore won.</p>
        <p>Pre-primary polls are notoriously variable because many voters begin thinking about the contest only a week or so beforehand, and because turnout is often low and individual turnout difficult to predict.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's supporters cited his experience and the accomplishments of the Clinton administration as their chief reasons for backing him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley's supporters cited his honesty and integrity, his general policies, and their dislike of other candidates as their chief reasons.</p>
        <p>Seven out of 10 Democratic primary voters said Mr. Gore could be trusted to keep his word as president. Six out of 10 said the same about Mr. Bradley. Only 16 percent said Mr. Gore had ever made or changed a policy decision as a direct result of money he received from a major campaign contributor. Only 11 percent said Mr. Bradley had done that.</p>
