        <p>Lori Beth Greifer, a social worker, and Glenn David Kaufman, the president of an Internet start-up company in Boston, were married last evening by Rabbi Myron Fenster at the Shelter Rock Jewish Center in Roslyn, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The couple met in Palm Beach, Fla., on New Year's Day 1999, while on vacation with their families. ''My father fixed me up,'' Mr. Kaufman recalled. But when he went to pick up Ms. Greifer at her parents' house, she seemed so shy that he thought, ''Not for me.'' During lunch, however, he decided that she was shy only around her parents.</p>
        <p>She is the daughter of Carol Greifer and Dr. Ira Greifer of Manhasset Hills, N.Y., and he is the son of Elaine Kaufman and Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist, who live in Wyckoff, N.J.</p>
        <p>The bride, 39, received bachelor's and master's degrees in social work from New York University. Until recently, she worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York as a social worker. Her mother is a psychotherapist and the vice president of the Family and Children's Association, a social service agency in Hempstead, N.Y. Her father is a professor of pediatrics and nephrology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 38, holds bachelor's and M.B.A. degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. He is the president of CorporateAlumni.com, which develops Web sites where former co-workers can keep in touch with one another, much like alumni of colleges and universities. His father, a former vice chairman of Salomon Inc., the New York investment bank, now heads the economic consulting firm bearing his name. His mother is president of the Elaine Kaufman Cultural Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>After the couple met in Palm Beach, their relationship progressed along with the new year. On Jan. 2, they had dinner with friends and family. The following day, the couple took the same plane back to New York, where Mr. Kaufman was to have made a connection to Boston. But bad weather canceled his flight, and Ms. Greifer invited him to stay at her Manhattan apartment. Later that evening, Ms. Greifer was opening mail and Mr. Kaufman was checking e-mail. He recalled thinking: ''This is nice. It's as if we've been married for 20 years.'' Ms. Greifer remembered thinking: ''This is nice. It's as if we've been married for 30 years.''</p>
        <p>In June, Mr. Kaufman proposed with roses and a card that read, ''Please join me for life.'' She said yes. The next day was Father's Day, and the Greifer and Kaufman families were celebrating together but did not know of the marriage plans. In response to a teasing comment by his father, the younger Mr. Kaufman said casually, ''Dad, is that any way to talk to my future wife?''</p>
        <p>His father continued talking, but upon a later mention of ''future wife,'' stopped midsentence, blinked and said, ''I want full credit!''</p>
