        <p>House Republicans unveiled their own proposal today to give a tax cut to married couples, stepping up pressure on President Clinton and Democrats to agree to an election-year compromise on taxes.</p>
        <p>The Republican plan, laid out by Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was intended in part to reduce the so-called marriage penalty paid by many two-income couples and represented a counteroffer to a more narrowly drawn provision proposed last week by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer said his plan, which would give a tax break to nearly all married couples, would be worth $182 billion over 10 years, more than four times as much as Mr. Clinton's plan.</p>
        <p>The benefits of the Republican plan would go to couples across the income spectrum whether or not they pay a marriage penalty and would include couples where only one spouse worked.</p>
        <p>The president's proposal, valued by the White House at $45 billion over 10 years, would limit benefits largely to two-income couples who claimed the standard deduction on their federal income taxes, nearly all of whom are in low-income and middle-income brackets and most of whom pay some marriage penalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer said his bill would be taken up by the Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday and would come to the floor for a vote by the full House in two weeks.</p>
        <p>It is the first in a series of separate tax cuts, each with powerful constituencies, that the House leadership intends to bring up this year in a change of strategy from the last few years, when Republicans assembled catchall tax bills that the White House and Democrats cast as fiscally irresponsible.</p>
        <p>''Fixing the marriage penalty would be the best Valentine's Day present we could give to millions of couples,'' Mr. Archer said today.</p>
        <p>Democrats said Mr. Archer's approach was too expensive, and they criticized the Republicans for not seeking a bipartisan deal before moving ahead with their own bill.</p>
        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, said the bulk of the tax relief under Mr. Archer's bill would go to the most affluent 25 percent of taxpayers. And he said the $180 billion cost of the tax cut would drain the projected federal budget surplus before Congress and the administration worked out plans to shore up Social Security and Medicare.</p>
        <p>Republicans have long made reducing or eliminating the marriage penalty a goal of their tax-cutting efforts. The penalty mostly hits couples in which the two partners have  similar incomes.</p>
        <p>In some cases, the penalty arises when the combined income of the partners pushes them into an income tax bracket higher than they would be subject to if single and filing separately. In other cases, couples pay the penalty because the standard deduction for couples filing jointly is less than half the standard deduction for a single filer.</p>
        <p>But not all couples pay a marriage penalty. Last year, of 51.4 million joint returns filed, 24.8 million, or 48 percent, paid a marriage penalty, according to a study by the Treasury Department. Another 21 million, or 41 percent -- mostly couples in which only one partner worked, or in which one partner made much more than the other -- actually got a marriage ''bonus,'' meaning a lower tax bill than they would pay if single.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer's bill would raise the standard deduction for couples so that it is twice that for single taxpayers. Most high-income couples itemized deductions and would not benefit from that change. Mr. Clinton's proposal is built around a similar increase in the standard deduction.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Archer also proposed to expand the 15 percent income tax bracket to higher income limits than under current law. Under his plan, the 15 percent bracket for married couples, which is adjusted for inflation each year and currently ends at $43,850 of taxable income, would rise gradually until 2008 when it would reach twice the level of single filers, currently $26,250.</p>
        <p>Mr. Archer's plan would also increase by $2,000 the income level at which married couples lose the earned income tax credit, a cash payment made by the government to working families below and just above the poverty line.</p>
        <p>Because of the way it is structured, Mr. Archer's plan would help all couples, not just those paying the marriage penalty, making his plan as much a broad-based tax cut for families as a marriage penalty bill.</p>
        <p>''We're basically trying to help people also who are at home with a single earner,'' he said. ''We certainly should be encouraging that homemaker who stays at home and takes care of the children.''</p>
        <p>The bill would provide no tax cut for single people.</p>
