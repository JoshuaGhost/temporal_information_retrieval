        <p>In a deeply troubling voting rights decision last month, the Supreme Court greatly weakened a powerful tool that the federal government has long used to end racial discrimination in voting rights. The tool, known as ''preclearance,'' has acted as an important deterrent to efforts by local communities to change their voting laws in ways that could discriminate against minority voters.</p>
        <p>The case involves the Bossier Parish School Board in Louisiana, which after the 1990 census drew up 12 districts, none of which had black majorities even though African-Americans make up about 20 percent of the parish's population. Under Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Bossier Parish, like other jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices, was required to seek preclearance from the Justice Department or a Federal District Court before enacting any voting change. The jurisdiction had to prove that the change ''does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.''</p>

        <p>In a deeply troubling voting rights decision last month, the Supreme Court greatly weakened a powerful tool that the federal government has long used to end racial discrimination in voting rights. The tool, known as ''preclearance,'' has acted as an important deterrent to efforts by local communities to change their voting laws in ways that could discriminate against minority voters.</p>
        <p>The case involves the Bossier Parish School Board in Louisiana, which after the 1990 census drew up 12 districts, none of which had black majorities even though African-Americans make up about 20 percent of the parish's population. Under Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Bossier Parish, like other jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices, was required to seek preclearance from the Justice Department or a Federal District Court before enacting any voting change. The jurisdiction had to prove that the change ''does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department found that the school board's plan had a discriminatory purpose  and refused to preclear it after the N.A.A.C.P. proposed an alternative plan showing that it was possible to create two majority-black districts. For years, the Justice Department has denied preclearance unless the jurisdiction could show that its  plan had no discriminatory purpose and would not weaken black voting power. Both tests are important because there have been cases where there  was a discriminatory purpose but no actual backsliding because minority voting strength was so  low that it was almost impossible to make things worse.</p>
        <p>Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the 5-to-4 majority, defied decades of practice and precedent in reinterpreting the ''purpose'' test. He argued that general discriminatory intent is not reason enough to deny preclearance. Instead, he maintained that the only prohibited purpose under Section 5 is  the specific intent to cause backsliding. That severely weakens the Justice Department's power to stop discriminatory plans before they take effect.</p>
        <p>The majority points out that illegal discriminatory intent and practices, though they cannot be stopped in advance, can still be challenged in court. But the victims of discrimination would have to bear the burden of proof and spend years in litigation. As Justice David Souter wrote in dissent, the point of Section 5 is to prevent defiant jurisdictions from staying one step ahead of court challenges to any particular voting scheme by replacing it with an equally discriminatory alternative.</p>
        <p>This harmful decision comes on the eve of the 2000 census, which will be the basis for redistricting plans in all states. Discrimination in voting rights is still a problem. Yet the federal government will now be forced to preclear illegal redistricting schemes intended to perpetuate that evil.</p>
