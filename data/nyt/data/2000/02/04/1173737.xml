        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>ITALY: ELECTION REFORM VOTE -- The constitutional court gave the go-ahead to seven referendums between April and June, including one that its supporters say would end political instability by abolishing election by proportional representation to a quarter of the seats in Parliament's 630-member lower house. In a vote last April, some 90 percent favored doing away with proportional representation. But the ballot was declared void when the turnout reached only 49.6 percent.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: FIVE BASQUES SEIZED -- The police arrested Juan Carlos Iglesias Chouzas, 36, considered a top commander of the Basque separatist group E.T.A., and four other suspected Basque separatists in a two-day sweep. It came just days after Spain detained eight people, including four leftist politicians, on charges of providing logistical aid to the rebels. The Spanish government holds E.T.A. rebels responsible for a bombing in Madrid that killed an army officer.</p>

        <p>FINLAND: CONSERVATIVE SURGES -- Support has surged for Esko Aho, the conservative candidate in the presidential vote on Sunday, and polls put him in a dead heat with a liberal seeking to become the first woman to be head of state. A survey of more than 1,400 voters gave Mr. Aho, of the conservative Center Party, a 49 percent rating, a big increase from results in two polls after the first round vote on Jan. 16. The same poll, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, put support for Foreign Minister Tarja Halonen of the Social Democrats at 51 percent, down sharply.</p>

        <p>GREECE: TURK VISITS -- Ismail Cem, the first Turkish foreign minister to visit Greece in 40 years, arrived in Athens to sign five accords and discuss the next steps for easing tensions between Greece and Turkey.

        <p>MEXICO: GOVERNOR FACES TRIAL -- The Supreme Court approved an impeachment trial of Gov. Jorge Carrillo Olea of Morelos, who took a leave of absence in May 1998 after two top aides were jailed in connection with the torture death of a kidnapping suspect. The Morelos legislature voted to impeach him last June, but the top state court said governors could not be put on trial.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: SWEDISH PEACE TALKS -- Leaders of Colombia's main rebel force and government officials arrived in Stockholm to hold peace talks and to study Scandinavia's socioeconomic system. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia commanders are meeting with government officials on a Swedish-sponsored trip as part of a plan to end Colombia's four-decades-old conflict.</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: TAX FRAUD DRIVE -- President Fernando de la Rua showed his determination for cracking down on tax fraud by starting a sweeping sting operation in which 72 tax officials coordinated raids on various businesses to find workers who are off the books and do not pay income tax. An estimated $20 billion a year is lost in taxes due to fraud.</p>

Indian paramilitary troops were stationed around the grounds and visitors had to pass through two separate security checks.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: KASHMIR HOLIDAY -- The military rulers have declared Saturday a public holiday in solidarity with militants fighting in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Rallies are planned and all government offices, banks and businesses will be closed.
