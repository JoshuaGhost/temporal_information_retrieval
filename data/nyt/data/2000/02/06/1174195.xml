        <p>THEY'RE all over Manhattan, taped to bus shelters, tacked to bulletin boards in Laundromats, their multiple telephone numbers hanging from the bottom like so many paper legs, trying to make matches in a city of millions. ''Wanted: Nanny for adorable child'' or ''Nonsmoking neat male needed'' or ''Moving sale: Everything must go.''</p>
        <p>Maya Perkins, who moved to New York nearly three years ago after she graduated from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass., was paying more attention than usual to the signs because the apartment she was sharing in Washington Heights was being reclaimed by its owner.</p>
        <p>One day last July, after fruitlessly answering newspaper ads, she noticed a piece of paper at a bus stop near Columbia University offering a room in a two-bedroom apartment on Broadway near 125th Street for $550 a month. She took down the number. Why not?</p>
        <p>She called the woman, and they had a good conversation, an instant rapport. A day later, when she rang the bell, she was buzzed right in. Climbing the stairs to the sixth-floor walkup, anticipating their meeting, she was hopeful. The woman, a 26-year-old music student and temp worker, had even included the dimensions of the room, a bit of honesty in advertising that appealed to her.</p>
        <p>She got to the top of the stairs and rang the bell. ''I said, 'I'm here to see the apartment,' '' she remembered. A furious voice on the other side told her to go away. A crazed, hysterical voice. ''She just totally flipped out and said, 'I'm going to call the police,' '' Ms. Perkins said. Completely bewildered, she went back down the six flights of stairs.</p>
        <p>At the bottom, she told her story to a woman who was entering the building, who in turn asked whether she was sure she had the right place.</p>
        <p>She didn't. And so she went to the building next door, rang the bell and repeated the process. This time, at the top, she was greeted by Melissa Bennett, as cheerful and warm as she would have expected from their phone call. ''I was just so happy she let me in,'' Ms. Perkins said. In a strange way, it made their introduction even easier.</p>
        <p>The two women have been sharing the apartment ever since, in that loose big-city way that agrees to no commitments and no rules. If Ms. Perkins, 25, wants to leave, she need only give a month's notice to Ms. Bennett, 26, whose name is on the lease and who has lived in the apartment for five years.</p>
        <p>It's a classic railroad flat, sunny and clean, with the rooms laid out in a line, linoleum flooring and a kitchen large enough to hold a table and two chairs.</p>
        <p>Both women seem grateful to have found a roommate who doesn't seem really strange. Ms. Perkins decided to move in even though she is allergic to cats, and Ms. Bennett has Rajah, a sleek and sinewy creature. ''It's hard to find a place without a cat,'' Ms. Perkins said.</p>
        <p>Both have used telephone conversations to get a sense of prospects. Ms. Bennett said she screened several dozen people on the phone before she found Ms. Perkins. ''With some, it's right away bye-bye,'' she said. Others reveal themselves more gradually. ''One guy said, 'I'm going to need to take over part of the living room.' Another guy wanted to bring his bike and build something for it in the bedroom.'' With Ms. Perkins, she said, ''We totally clicked right away. We had a great conversation.''</p>
        <p>MS. BENNETT, being the original tenant, has the larger bedroom, with swirls of blue sponge painting and an empty fish tank. ''I had a Jack Dempsey, but it ate all the others, and then he got a fungus,'' she explained. Ms. Perkins has the small bedroom at the front, where she has hung the head and arm pieces from the Wonder Woman costume she wore in last fall's Greenwich Village Halloween parade.</p>
        <p>Both women work downtown, but western Harlem is where they want to live. Ms. Perkins, who has friends living near Columbia, works at the Center for Urban Justice, a 15-year-old nonprofit group based in NoHo that helps homeless people, or nearly homeless people, cope with welfare problems. The center's workers introduce themselves to people at soup kitchens and food pantries.</p>
        <p>''Everyone thinks we're lawyers,'' she said. ''They call me 'lady lawyer.' '' And in fact, she recently took the law school admission test. She may become a lawyer, she said, or a teacher. Whatever she does, she said, she has one clear goal: ''I feel like my life's work is to stop people from going to prison.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bennett originally moved to the neighborhood to study oboe at the Manhattan School of Music. Now, though, she is working as an administrative assistant in a financial-services firm, getting ready to apply to graduate school in social work at Columbia. The life of a musician is too financially precarious, she said, and the instability was ruining her joy.</p>
        <p>''It was making me hate my art,'' she said. She decided on graduate school, she said, ''to preserve the fire'' that music gives her.</p>
