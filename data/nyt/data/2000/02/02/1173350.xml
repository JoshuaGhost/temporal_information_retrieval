        <p>Ballot Rules Overturned  A federal judge forced Republicans on Long Island to drop efforts to remove Steve Forbes from the New York State primary ballot. The judge suggested that he would rule in favor of Senator John McCain.  PAGE B1</p>
        <p>For Bush, a Nasty Surprise  Gov. George W. Bush and his advisers knew he might lose to Senator McCain in New Hampshire, but they had trouble imagining that his opponent's margin of victory would be in the double digits.  PAGE A17</p>
        <p>McCain's Gamble Pays Off  Senator McCain bet all on New Hampshire and was rewarded with a Republican primary jackpot that seemed to stun even him. He called it a victory for reform.  PAGE A17</p>
        <p>The Pundits: Past Imperfect  Thanks to exit polls, television commentators were so sure of the results in New Hampshire that some spoke in the past tense even before the voting had ended.  PAGE A16</p>
        <p>In South, a Different Story  As the race moves to South Carolina, Senator McCain will find that Governor Bush is several laps ahead, with polls last month giving him a lead of 22 percentage points. PAGE A18</p>
