      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Shortly after President George Bush lost his re-election bid in 1992, George W. Bush told a friend that his father ''should never have let Bill Clinton dictate the terms of debate.''</p>
        <p>When his turn came, the younger Mr. Bush did not make the same error. Having been trounced by Senator John McCain of Arizona in the New Hampshire primary, having been branded as the stick-in-the-mud candidate, Mr. Bush came to South Carolina, recast himself as a hard-nosed conservative, as an outsider and as a reformer who gets results.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush and his surrogates suggested, was a bit too liberal, too Beltway-bound and too flaky.</p>
        <p>The governor, in other words, stole Mr. McCain's clothes.</p>
        <p>He righted his campaign, regained the momentum he enjoyed before New Hampshire and re-emerged as a strong favorite to win the Republican presidential nomination. Severely wounded here, Mr. McCain will have a chance to rebound in the voting on Tuesday in Michigan, where the ideological coloration of the electorate may be more favorable to him, and he has vowed to fight on in what could develop into a drawn-out struggle not unlike the one between Ronald Reagan and Gerald R. Ford in 1976. But the electoral calendar grows more favorable to Governor Bush as it moves through March.</p>
        <p>The religious right provided Mr. Bush's margin of victory in South Carolina, where it is vastly more powerful than in the North.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of those who identified themselves as Christian conservatives supported the Texas governor, who made a controversial campaign appearance at Bob Jones University, an evangelical stronghold in Greenville. Among those who said they had no links to the religious right, Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush fought to a draw.</p>
        <p>Both candidates, a survey of voters in today's Republican primary suggested, were seen as reformers, but when they were pitted against one another, Mr. Bush was seen as the more effective one -- precisely as he had portrayed himself in a late blitz of television commercials here.</p>
        <p>Other commercials flailed away at Mr. McCain's advocacy of campaign finance reform. Nearly half the voters said that the senator says one thing and does another when it comes to campaign finance, and they were mostly Bush backers. That was a second building block of the governor's victory.</p>
        <p>A third was his success in capitalizing on what Mr. McCain now sees as a major error, an intemperate commercial in which he compared Mr. Bush to President Clinton. By election day, voters were much more likely to see Mr. McCain than Mr. Bush as an unfair aggressor, even though Mr. McCain had come into the state with a reputation as a proponent of cleaner politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's television blitz, which dangerously depleted his treasury, appeared to have paid off among those who made their decisions in the frantic final hours of the campaign here. About a third of the voters told interviewers for a consortium formed by the television networks and The Associated Press that they made up their minds in the last week or so, and most went to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>For Senator McCain, the critical failure was an inability to broaden the electorate sufficiently. Knowing that he was trailing Mr. Bush among the state's unusually conservative Republican voters, he made an unabashed appeal to Democratic and independent voters to cast ballots in the Republican primary, hoping that the absence of a Democratic primary would make it easier to attract those groups.</p>
        <p>He vowed last week to create ''a new Republican party'' in South Carolina by bringing thousands of new voters into the primary. The exit polling showed that 30 percent of today's voters were new to Republican primaries, but traditional Republicans, apparently worried that they were losing control of their primary, turned out in droves for Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCain got 8 out of every 10 Democratic votes, but they constituted less than a tenth of the electorate, not enough to have a major impact.  Likewise among independents, who constituted about a third of those who cast ballots today. Mr. McCain took about twice as many of their votes as his principal rival.</p>
        <p>Overall, Republicans accounted for only a slightly smaller percentage of the electorate than they did four years ago, marking a signal lack of success for Mr. McCain's efforts.  The electorate was nearly all white, more than half male and older than most, with 4 voters in 10 over 60.</p>
        <p>One important element in the relatively modest crossover vote was the decision by black voters, who form the backbone of the modern Democratic party in this state, to resist any suggestion that they vote in the Republican primary. They told interviewers earlier this week that the two candidates had forfeited any claim on their support by refusing to condemn the flying of the Confederate battle flag over the Capitol in Columbia.</p>
        <p>Immediately after his loss in New Hampshire, Governor Bush boldly announced that South Carolina was ''Bush country.'' His aides calculated that the same party organization that carried his father to victory in 1988, originally assembled by former Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., would do the same for him. They proved prescient. Voters told interviewers that they prefer a candidate who is loyal to the Republican party and has ties to its local leaders, and they overwhelmingly saw Mr. Bush as embodying that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also succeeded in portraying himself as the more reliable foe of abortion in a state where opposition to abortion is strong. Nearly two-thirds of the most vehement anti-abortion voters went to Mr. Bush; in New Hampshire, competing in a more crowded field, he got one-third.</p>
        <p>Although he did not gain the upset he had hoped for here, Mr. McCain rode his New Hampshire victory to something approaching parity with Mr. Bush in financial terms. Now, with two days to campaign, he will go after the conservative white voters known as Reagan Democrats in the counties clustered north of Detroit.</p>
        <p>Michigan has a long history of backing protest candidates and insurgents, like the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who won its 1988 Democratic caucuses. Its Republicans are less conservative than South Carolina's.  And Gov. John Engler, who used to talk about providing an asbestos wall there to protect Mr. Bush, has been sounding a much different note lately.</p>
        <p>Nobody in Michigan, the governor said the other day, likes to be taken for granted and to be told that one candidate is a certain victor.</p>
        <p>But Michigan is followed by a big group of primaries on March 7, the most important of which, New York's and California's, are effectively closed to all but Republican voters. Among the big states voting on that day, only Ohio's is open -- a considerable advantage for Governor Bush. Then on March 14, Texas, his home base, and Florida, where his brother Jeb is governor, will cast their votes. As the nation's second and fourth largest states, they will wield considerable influence at the 2000 Republican convention.</p>
        <p>Had Mr. McCain won here, none of those details would have mattered nearly as much. As he himself exulted this week, ''If we win here, I don't see how we really can be stopped.''  But he could not bring it off. For the fourth time in a row, South Carolina resurrected a New Hampshire loser.</p>
        <p>How The Poll Was Conducted</p>
        <p>The Election Day poll was based on questionnaires completed by voters leaving voting stations throughout South Carolina on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The poll was conducted by Voter News Service, an organization created by ABC News, CBS News, CNN, NBC News, the Associated Press and Fox News.</p>
        <p>The results are based on the responses of 2,078 Republican primary voters in 40 randomly selected sites across the state.</p>
        <p>In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results from such polls should differ by no more than plus or minus 3 percentage points from what would have been obtained by trying to interview all primary voters on Saturday in South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Results based on smaller sub-groups have a larger potential error.</p>
        <p>As well, the practical difficulties of conducting a survey of voter opinion on Election Day, such as reluctance to fill out a questionnaire, may skew the results.</p>
