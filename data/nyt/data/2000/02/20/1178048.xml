        <p>The headline on an article regarding the permit granted to us for a clinic in Massapequa [''Planned Parenthood Gets Limited Permit,'' Feb. 6] implied that Planned Parenthood of Nassau County had agreed to restrict its activities at the health center. This is simply not true.</p>
        <p>Through his representatives, Supervisor John Venditto of the Town of Oyster Bay asked us to put into writing a statement that Planned Parenthood would never perform abortions at the Massapequa site, a request we refused. While I did inform Mr. Venditto in writing that at this time, Planned Parenthood has no plans to perform surgical abortions at this site, the permit we received from the Town of Oyster Bay places no restrictions on the kinds of services we can perform in Massapequa, now or in the future.</p>

        <p>What is most unfortunate about the town's nearly yearlong delay in issuing a building permit is the deliberate denial of health care services to thousands of people in an area that has one of the highest incidences of teenage pregnancy in Nassau.</p>
