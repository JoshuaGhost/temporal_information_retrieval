        <p>Those who champion the low-fat vegetarian vegan diet have long made broad health claims for the regimen. Now one of the diet's biggest advocates is making a new claim; he says it can greatly reduce menstrual pain and the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.</p>
        <p>Not all of the 33 women studied reported benefits, but most did, said Dr. Neal D. Barnard, the diet's advocate and the president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which helped conduct the study. ''In some of them, it was quite profound,'' Dr. Barnard said.</p>

        <p>Those who champion the low-fat vegetarian vegan diet have long made broad health claims for the regimen. Now one of the diet's biggest advocates is making a new claim; he says it can greatly reduce menstrual pain and the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.</p>
        <p>Not all of the 33 women studied reported benefits, but most did, said Dr. Neal D. Barnard, the diet's advocate and the president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which helped conduct the study. ''In some of them, it was quite profound,'' Dr. Barnard said.</p>
        <p>On average, researchers said, the women reported having pain one and a half fewer days a month. The study, by Georgetown University Medical Center researchers, appears this month in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology.</p>
        <p>The vegan diet includes grains, vegetables, legumes and fruits, but no animal products, which include dairy and eggs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Barnard said those women who benefited saw improvements in a month.</p>
        <p>The women studied were divided into two groups. One ate a vegan diet, and the other ate normally, but its members were given placebos. The women then switched.</p>
        <p>The researchers said they had based the study on their theory that if women reduced the fat in their diets, their bodies would produce less prostaglandin, a chemical implicated in menstrual pain that is made from fat traces stored in cell membranes.</p>
