        <p>The price of crude oil jumped to more than $30 a barrel yesterday for the first time since the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and a sharp run-up in gasoline prices looks increasingly likely this summer.</p>
        <p>The price of crude oil neared $30 in mid-January, slipped and then rallied again last week. All the time, traders were weighing concerns about declining inventories of crude oil, home heating oil and gasoline against the possibility of a production increase from major oil producers when they meet at the end of March.</p>
        <p>As new data showed some inventories tightening last week, only promises of increased production by unnamed OPEC officials kept the price of crude oil from piercing $30. But several reports yesterday put a damper on the prospect of a production increase, and the $30 barrier was breached. The price of crude oil for March delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped 81 cents, to $30.25 a barrel.</p>
        <p>Of course, new comments from OPEC officials holding out the hope of production increases could depress the price again. In fact, yesterday's comments contradicted what appeared to be clear signals last week that Venezuela and Saudi Arabia would ask for an increase by June at a meeting of OPEC countries at the end of next month.</p>
        <p>Even if the producers relent, the production cuts that began last March -- equal to 4.3 million barrels a day -- may have already set the stage for a sharp rise in gasoline prices later this year and a stronger political response from the United States and Europe.</p>
        <p>''If OPEC eases in June, it's too late,'' said Irene King, senior oil markets analyst for J. P. Morgan &amp; Company, referring to peak gasoline demand in the summer. Because of the lag time between increased crude oil production and the refining of gasoline, she said, ''we will have to go through the early summer driving season with very low gasoline inventories; that would make the heating oil squeeze we had a few weeks ago look like a piece of cake.''</p>
        <p>Retail gasoline prices, according to the Department of Energy, rose to $1.356 a gallon this week, up 48 percent in the last year and the highest since late 1990.</p>
        <p>In the futures market, the price of unleaded gasoline for March delivery rose 2.3 cents yesterday, to 83.41 cents a gallon. Gasoline is now above the price of home heating oil, which rose 1.5 cents, to 75.70 cents a gallon yesterday. But it is far below the 95.20 cents a gallon price of Jan. 31.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has no plans now to dip into the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, although he is being pressed to do so by Northeastern politicians, including Sen. Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. A spokesman for the Energy Department said yesterday that this was ''not an option in the current environment and the last four words are key.'' The weather has moderated in the Northeast, reducing concern about home heating oil inventories. But in California, where gasoline prices are a concern to the state's many drivers, the prices could be  thrust into the spotlight as its presidential primary nears.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson is scheduled to meet with energy officials in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait at the end of the month, but had to cancel a meeting with Venezuelan oil officials because of a scheduling conflict.</p>
        <p>Anticipating what OPEC and the price of oil are going to do is complex in part because of politics, both in OPEC and the United States. The Iranian elections are this week, and some analysts have said that OPEC wants to look determined to bolster oil prices to help moderates win there. An OPEC that bowed to the West by increasing production, analysts argue, could be used against the moderates. In addition, the United States does not want to threaten Saudi Arabia and lose its support, which could happen if the Clinton administration dipped into the the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
        <p>It is also possible that OPEC members would argue for a production increase only after the price of crude topped $30 a barrel and world inventories fell. At this point, they may find it easier to persuade members that a modest production increase of about a million barrels a day would not send crude oil prices tumbling.</p>
        <p>But even if this is the goal, analysts say, OPEC leaders like Saudi Arabia do not want oil prices to climb too quickly. A sharp rise could prompt a stronger reaction from United States and European leaders who have to worry about the impact of higher prices on consumers, voters and the economy. So the recent comments from OPEC officials may have been intended to keep the price of crude oil from rising too fast.</p>
        <p>A report from Venezuela helped jar the oil market yesterday, said James R. Steel, an energy analyst at Refco Inc. Alvaro Silva, the vice oil minister of Venezuela, told Dow Jones newswires that there were no plans to ask for a crude oil production increase at the March OPEC meeting. His comments contradicted the signal Friday of a production increase from an unnamed Venezuelan official. Dow Jones also reported that Shokri Ghanem, the director of OPEC's research division, said that ''support is growing among OPEC members for an extension of the cuts'' beyond March. And over the weekend, Iraq repeated its threats to cut its oil production.</p>
        <p>''This is really pouring cold water on this idea that took hold last week that Saudi Arabia would allow a production increase,'' Mr. Steel said.</p>
        <p>The sharp decline in inventories of crude oil and products showed up in a report by the International Energy Agency on Friday.</p>
        <p>The report said inventories among the 29 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development were the lowest since February 1997.</p>
