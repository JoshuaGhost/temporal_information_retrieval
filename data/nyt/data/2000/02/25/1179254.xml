        <p>Robert Mann Gallery  210 11th Avenue, near 25th Street  Chelsea  Through March 18</p>
        <p>The title of this excellent presentation of works from the 1950's reflects not only the subject matter -- stone walls on Martha's Vineyard and divers in flight -- but also the paradoxical nature of Aaron Siskind's art.</p>
        <p>Starting in the 1940's, Siskind sought to create a kind of photographic equivalent of abstract painting by getting rid of anecdotal imagery and focusing on flat, boldly frontal subjects. One of the works here, a picture of a crumpled, oil-stained piece of paper made in 1950, looks suspiciously like a painting by the photographer's friend Willem de Kooning, and it is interesting to learn that de Kooning owned a copy of the image.</p>

        <p>The title of this excellent presentation of works from the 1950's reflects not only the subject matter -- stone walls on Martha's Vineyard and divers in flight -- but also the paradoxical nature of Aaron Siskind's art.</p>
        <p>Starting in the 1940's, Siskind sought to create a kind of photographic equivalent of abstract painting by getting rid of anecdotal imagery and focusing on flat, boldly frontal subjects. One of the works here, a picture of a crumpled, oil-stained piece of paper made in 1950, looks suspiciously like a painting by the photographer's friend Willem de Kooning, and it is interesting to learn that de Kooning owned a copy of the image.</p>
        <p>The paradox is that Siskind's works remain traditionally photographic: machine-made, crisply focused and transparently illusionistic, they have none of the material immediacy or gestural spontaneity of the painting that inspired them. Siskind's always perfectly framed boulders or sections of graffitied or peeling walls can make one think of Motherwell, Kline, Twombly and others, but rich as they are, they have an almost clinical sobriety to them; they are like specimens collected by a scientist.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, in monumentalizing pictures of bare feet, formality is animated by a comical strangeness that verges on the surrealistic. And in pictures of young men diving, the subjects are at once frozen, emblematic shapes on white squares and exhilarating images of the expressive freedom that one suspects the photographer envied in his painter friends.</p>
