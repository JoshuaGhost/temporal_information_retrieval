        <p>Aimee Mann and Michael Penn are a two-career couple who live in Los Angeles and share the same line of work: songwriting. The other night at Joe's Pub, they shared the stage in affectionate teamwork. They backed up each others' songs and laughed at each others' humor. For an encore they did a fond Sonny and Cher imitation, singing ''I Got You Babe.'' It was a show of companionable partnership that contradicted nearly everything they sang about, as if to prove that art doesn't imitate life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mann has just been nominated for an Academy Award for ''Save Me'' from the film ''Magnolia,'' which was based on her songs. She and Mr. Penn are close observers of crumbling relationships, of festering distrust, of dependence turned to desperation, of lovers who can't bear to break up or to stay together. ''Have you reached the point,'' Mr. Penn sang Thursday night, ''where you must choose between what you lost and what you stand to lose?''</p>

        <p>Aimee Mann and Michael Penn are a two-career couple who live in Los Angeles and share the same line of work: songwriting. The other night at Joe's Pub, they shared the stage in affectionate teamwork. They backed up each others' songs and laughed at each others' humor. For an encore they did a fond Sonny and Cher imitation, singing ''I Got You Babe.'' It was a show of companionable partnership that contradicted nearly everything they sang about, as if to prove that art doesn't imitate life.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mann has just been nominated for an Academy Award for ''Save Me'' from the film ''Magnolia,'' which was based on her songs. She and Mr. Penn are close observers of crumbling relationships, of festering distrust, of dependence turned to desperation, of lovers who can't bear to break up or to stay together. ''Have you reached the point,'' Mr. Penn sang Thursday night, ''where you must choose between what you lost and what you stand to lose?''</p>
        <p>They don't write with each other. But they are obvious Beatles fans, slipping harmonic twists and chiseled lyrics behind graceful melodies, and both lean toward ballads.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mann's songs are like private conversations and arguments, often expecting trouble but unable to avoid it: ''You got what you want/Now you can hardly stand it,'' she sang in ''Wise Up.'' Her voice sublimates the lyrics' resentment and cynicism; it's a cool croon that can effortlessly float up an octave, with a vibrato that suggests a lingering ache. Mr. Penn's lyrics are more imagistic, with a touch of tall-tale humor, while his melodies are constrained by a reedy voice that's part John Lennon, part James Taylor.</p>
        <p>Their joint tour, which they call ''Acoustic Vaudeville,'' piles on additional contradictions. It is scheduled to return to New York in April. The format includes comedians -- on Thursday night, Janeane Garofalo and Andy Kindler -- who ad-lib banter between songs while the musicians tune up.</p>
        <p>Instead of dwelling on the mood of wounded love, the comics deliberately rupture it, putting show business quotation marks around the songs. Mr. Kindler previewed ''Save Me'' as the source not of ''Magnolia'' but of the hospital comedy ''Patch Adams,'' perhaps responding to its first couplet: ''You look like a perfect fit/ For a girl in need of a tourniquet.''</p>
        <p>But the songs weren't played for laughs. The band had a finely detailed restraint. Patrick Warren used a Chamberlin -- an old mellotronlike keyboard -- for surreal approximations of clarinet or strings; John Sands on drums deployed brushes, bongos and triangles for pinpoint effects. Often the rhythm section didn't join in until the last verse and when the band did unfurl an expansive crescendo, the songs became anthems of isolation.</p>
        <p>Venturing some banter herself, Ms. Mann said, ''We're very comfortable with awkward silences.'' In the songs, she and Mr. Penn revealed what those silences could conceal.</p>
