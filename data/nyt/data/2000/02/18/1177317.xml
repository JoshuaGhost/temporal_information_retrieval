        <p>They look as if they're waiting to be immortalized by Norman Rockwell, these open-faced Brooklyn lads, but it's clear that they've got the itch, and bad. Restless, randy, hungry for action: you've seen their kind before in American musicals, ready to erupt into violent dance and show-stopping anthems of youth.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, when this quartet sings, in the opening minutes of ''Saturday Night,'' a 40-some-year-old show that is just now having its official New York premiere, the voices are often soft and reflective, and the melody they carry keeps sliding away from forthright buoyancy, as if retreating from hope.</p>
        <p>It's a charming, even funny number about nothing more serious than being single and not having a date. But its wistful quality is bottomless. And when the singers observe that ''alive and alone on a Saturday night is dead,'' the hyperbole is sincerely felt.</p>
        <p>That mood tinges all of ''Saturday Night,'' which opened last night at the Second Stage Theater, lending a gentle power to a show with a slight, contrived book and a decidedly dated air. It also sets off echoes sure to stir the hearts of aficionados of the American musical.</p>
        <p>The title song of ''Saturday Night,'' written for characters on the cusp of adulthood, was created by a young composer on the edge of maturity. Stephen Sondheim, then in his mid-20's, had been given his first chance to write the complete score and lyrics for a Broadway show. The musical, which was tabled after the death of its 40-year-old producer, Lemuel Ayers, would remain unproduced for four decades, itself a story of hopes brightening and dimming.</p>
        <p>During its long consignment to limbo, Mr. Sondheim quickly graduated into shiny success. He also continued to write about the pain of hoping to connect. ''Alone is alone, not alive,'' goes a lyric from ''Company,'' the show that established his reputation as the bard of urban anxieties. Look closely and you'll see the same yearning face in ''Saturday Night.''</p>
        <p>The startling, expressive talent that gives voice to that yearning may still be embryonic in ''Saturday Night,'' but it is definitely there. Kathleen Marshall, the inventive choreographer (''Kiss Me, Kate'') and the artistic director of the Encores! musical concert series, has staged ''Saturday Night'' with an understanding that it has to be treated delicately for its particular and prophetic charms to emerge.</p>
        <p>This tale of coming of age in Flatbush on the eve of the 1929 stock market crash is burdened with a sluggish book by Julius J. Epstein and characters who suggest a middle-class answer to the Bowery Boys. It is not made for slam-bang showmanship. Overselling its  tame-seeming streetwise comedy and tentative love story would sink it.</p>
        <p>Wisely, Ms. Marshall has encouraged her fresh-faced cast, led by the Australian cabaret star David Campbell and Lauren Ward (''Violet,'' ''1776''), to shimmer instead of dazzle. Ms. Marshall's choreography correspondingly emphasizes imaginative wit over calisthenic flash. It is as if the production were introducing a shy but very talented child, who must be coaxed instead of pushed into the limelight.</p>
        <p>Like Derek McLane's sets, which present a vision of New York as storybook-innocent in its way as that of the movie ''Stuart Little,'' the overall production has an aura of nostalgia that's knowing without being snide. Based on ''Front Porch in Flatbush,'' an autobiographical play by the brothers Julius J. and Philip G. Epstein (screenwriters on ''Casablanca''), ''Saturday Night'' follows the fortunes of a group of Brooklyn chums eager to get lucky, both financially and sexually.</p>
        <p>At their center is the charismatic Gene (Mr. Campbell), at the house of whose conveniently absent father much of the action takes place. An order clerk on Wall Street, Gene has been infected with get-rich fever and a taste for glamour. Trying to crash a dance at the Plaza Hotel, he meets a fancy Southern debutante type who turns out to be Helen (Ms. Ward), just another pretender from Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The central, oddly gnarled plot is about how Gene's aspirations to grandeur get him into trouble. It is not, to tell the truth, a gripping or believable story, and its adult version of adolescent humor, wide-eyed with the hint of a leer, must have seemed stale even in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>What's more, the show's message -- abandon ambition, be yourself and stay at home -- is a downer, given the subliminal ache of longing that informs so much of the music. You get the idea that most of these characters will indeed spend all their Saturday nights at home in Brooklyn. No matter what the script intends, this does not register as a gladdening thought.</p>
        <p>But the composer of ''Saturday Night'' is already aware that ''happy endings can spring a leak,'' as a Sondheim lyric from a later show observes. And it's the tug between the conventional all-American hominess of the script and the suggestions of ambivalence in its score that make ''Saturday Night'' more than a dismissible piece of juvenalia. The show has dreary stretches, but it leaves a sweetly haunting afterglow.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as orchestrated by the extraordinary Jonathan Tunick, a longtime collaborator of Mr. Sondheim's, the score seems forever balanced between wise-guy jauntiness and lyric gravity. It's an appealing combination that gives us, on the one hand, several truly exquisite ballads (''So Many People,'' ''What More Do I Need?'') and, on the other, comic treats like the ensemble number ''That Kind of a Neighborhood,'' a paean to life in Brooklyn that anticipates the satiric lyrics of ''West Side Story.''</p>
        <p>You can see glimmers of the hungry words to ''Some People'' from ''Gypsy'' in ''Class,'' Gene's hymn to upward mobility, a song notable for underpinning brassy affirmation with minor-key doubts. And the pastiche master that Mr. Sondheim would prove himself to be in ''Follies'' is prefigured here in the piano rag of the overture and the wonderfully droll crooner piece ''Love's a Bond,'' which translates the language of romance into that of Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sondheim's celebrated verbal dexterity comes through slyly in the sustained financial metaphors of that song, performed in wry period style by Donald Corren, with simple language in deft combinations. (''This bond if you get it/is stable and yet it/will grow if you let it/ mature.'') Not every set of lyrics is that smooth. But who else would manage to find an internal rhyme for sex in the middle initial of Francis X. Bushman, the silent movie star?</p>
        <p>''Saturday Night'' has been given full productions only twice previously, at the Bridewell Theater in London (1997) and by the Pegasus Players in Chicago (1999). In introducing the show to New York, Ms. Marshall doesn't make the mistake of deconstructing something that most people haven't seen in any form. There's neither retrospecitve winking nor heavy-handed dragging of dark emotions to the surface.</p>
        <p>Instead, the approach is largely to let the score set the tone for everything else in the show, starting with the soft-pedaled whimsy of Ms. Marshall's choreography. There's a delightful sequence in which Gene's pals float through a Park Avenue apartment on roller skates brandishing the accouterments of high-society life and a winningly graceful and unsalacious interpretation of ''Exhibit A,'' a lesson in the art of seducing a girl, adroitly performed by Christopher Fitzgerald.</p>
        <p>In vocal terms, it's hard to imagine a better cast. Michael Benjamin Washington, Kirk McDonald, Greg Zola and Joey Sorge bring just the right sharpness and restraint to the intricacies of the twice-reprised title song. Clarke Thorell and Andrea Burns, as the show's token married couple, generate a spontaneous feeling of speech in singing a duet about their first date.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell, the image of the Arrow Shirt man come to life, looks perfect for a magnetic leader of a fledgling white-collar pack, and as expected, he sings with clear and appealing tunefulness. What he fails to convey, crucially, is his character's explosive, unstable side; this Gene is too easy to domesticate.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ward isn't entirely comfortable with the comic Southern accent of her first song, which has to be exaggerated for the number to work. Once that's out of the way, she inhabits her sketchily written character with a thoroughness that makes her the focal point of every scene she's in. And she brings a fine emotional elegance to her love songs.</p>
        <p>There is also one heart-stopping scene in which the faces of Mr. Campbell and Ms. Ward betray almost too much. ''Saturday Night'' ends, as musicals of its period usually did, with a finale promising domestic bliss for its leading lovers. But it's the number that concludes the first act that you're more likely  to remember.</p>
        <p>It happens just after Gene has announced to his friends his intention of marrying Helen, a declaration that takes everyone, including Helen, by surprise. As the ensemble rousingly sings of the pros and cons of marriage, it hoists the lovers onto its shoulders. Gene and Helen exchange a glance just then, and it is filled with naked terror. Relationships are scary things. Mr. Sondheim has spent much of his subsequent career exploring this basic truth.</p>
