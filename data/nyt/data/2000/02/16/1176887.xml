        <p>Comedy and dance, music and songs, tributes, video highlights and prayers were offered today in a high-spirited memorial service for Derrick Thomas here at Kemper Arena before several thousand people.</p>
        <p>The three-hour service marked the end of this city's emotional two-day goodbye for Thomas, the Kansas City Chiefs linebacker who died of a blood clot on Feb. 8 after an auto accident here on Jan. 23 had left him paralyzed from the chest down. Thomas's final services will be held on Friday in Miami, his hometown, where he will be buried on Saturday.</p>
        <p>For the people of Kansas City, however, this was his home and he was their own. This was a recurrent theme throughout today's service, which was filled with laughter and with tears.</p>
        <p>Carl Peterson, the Chiefs' president and general manager, described Thomas, 33, as ''the son I never had.''</p>
        <p>Peterson recalled the first time he met Thomas, 11 years ago, when he scouted the swift and strong linebacker from the University of Alabama. Thomas, he said, put ''28 hours in a 24-hour day'' and played football and offered charity work in similar overdrive fashion.</p>
        <p>''We would see his heart grow over the next 11 years, and he always went back and kept in touch with the people who touched his life,'' Peterson said. ''Derrick came to the heartland of America, and it was here that he gave his heart. It was always my desire that Derrick would play his entire career here; I would not have allowed anything else. By the grace of God, he will always be a Kansas City Chief. He was so special. Was he perfect? No. Did he make mistakes? Yes. Did I have to reprimand him? Yes. I watched him grow to become a great ambassador for Kansas City, the Chiefs and the National Football League. He will always be my son. In truth, he will always be our son.''</p>
        <p>Peterson asked the crowd to remember Thomas by always wearing a seat belt. Thomas was not wearing one in the accident.</p>
        <p>Lamar Hunt, the Chiefs' owner, noted that Thomas was born on Jan. 1, 1967, the day the Chiefs beat Buffalo to qualify for the first Super Bowl. He said that Thomas's hospital infant numbers included 58, which was his Chiefs jersey number.</p>
        <p>''He was just meant to be a Chief,'' Hunt said. ''In America today, there is a void.''</p>
        <p>Paul Tagliabue, the N.F.L. commissioner, said that Thomas was the inspiration behind the league's annual teacher of the year award because of a speech Thomas once gave about a teacher's impact on his life. Tagliabue said that since Thomas's death he had been reading about the deep affection for him here and that one quotation from a fan was among those most memorable: ''We're not here because Derrick Thomas died; we're here because he lived.''</p>
        <p>A letter of condolence was read from President Clinton. It was announced that there would be a Kansas City highway and school named after Thomas. There was little doubt that he would one day be placed in the Chiefs' Ring of Fame at Arrowhead Stadium and would be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio.</p>
        <p>One of Thomas's former Chiefs teammates, Tony Richardson, while speaking, reached into his pocket and put an Alabama cap on his head, a special act for a player from the Auburn University, Alabama's chief rival.</p>
        <p>The comedian Joe Torry asked the crowd to celebrate the children present ''because you know this man was a success when you see these kids who followed him.''</p>
        <p>One of them, Rahman McGill, a student from Thomas's charity, the Third and Long Foundation, spoke about what Thomas had meant to him.</p>
        <p>''I'm here today to tell you about my friend, confidant, mentor and brother, Derrick Thomas,'' McGill said. ''I'm here to tell you about the soul of the man.</p>
        <p>''Derrick was at his best around young people who he could mold and motivate. I told him once that I wanted to be a Supreme Court justice. He started calling me Justice. And soon after that he arranged for me to meet Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Derrick's voice still echoes in my ear, and his pride is still vivid in my mind. I'm talking about the soul of the man. I thank God for Derrick. I promise to be to Derrick's sons what he has been to me.''</p>
