        <p>Wading back into an area that brought her both national prominence and a high-profile defeat, Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged today to push anew for universal health care coverage, proposing legislation that would give  consumers unrestricted access to low-cost prescription drugs sold in Canada.</p>
        <p>''We have to keep moving,'' Mrs. Clinton declared to an audience of doctors, nurses and researchers at Strong Memorial Hospital. ''I didn't give up then, and I won't give up now. I have always believed health care is a fundamental human right.''</p>

        <p>Wading back into an area that brought her both national prominence and a high-profile defeat, Hillary Rodham Clinton pledged today to push anew for universal health care coverage, proposing legislation that would give  consumers unrestricted access to low-cost prescription drugs sold in Canada.</p>
        <p>''We have to keep moving,'' Mrs. Clinton declared to an audience of doctors, nurses and researchers at Strong Memorial Hospital. ''I didn't give up then, and I won't give up now. I have always believed health care is a fundamental human right.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''We can never give up until we figure out a way to provide quality health insurance to everyone in our country.''</p>
        <p>With that declaration, Mrs. Clinton began setting out the ways she would try to make health care coverage a central issue in her campaign for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>In contrast to 1994, when Mrs. Clinton and the president pushed a wide-ranging universal health care coverage that collapsed in the face of opposition in Congress, Mrs. Clinton argued today for incremental steps, starting -- at least for the purposes of her campaign -- with the prescription drug bill.</p>
        <p>Under the legislation, pharmacists in the United States would be allowed to buy medicines from their counterparts in Canada, where, because of cost controls imposed by the government, prices are typically one-third lower.</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Clinton did not mention it, similar legislation has been introduced in Congress by Representative Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, but it has faced strong opposition from pharmaceutical manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton said that the drugs, both those shipped to Canada and those sold in the United States, were typically made with the same ingredients, in the same factories and under the same controls. ''The only difference is that Americans are paying more in retail costs than the rest of the world,'' she said. ''I was told that New Yorkers never bought retail. Well, that's wrong when it comes to drugs.''</p>
        <p>The restriction on reimporting drugs was contained in legislation passed by Congress in 1988.</p>
        <p>That measure was an effort not to control the cost of prescription drugs, but to assure their safety. The concern was that the Food and Drug Administration could not monitor the potency or the quality of drugs that were imported into the United States, even if they had been manufactured here.</p>
        <p>Jackie Cottrell, a spokeswoman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade association, denounced Mrs. Clinton's announcement as ''an election year proposal.''</p>
        <p>''Mrs. Clinton's proposal would overturn landmark consumer protection legislation by a partisan Congress, led by her own party, passed 10 years ago to protect consumers from unsafe, potentially adulterated medicine,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's Republican opponent, had no reaction to her proposal, said his campaign spokeswoman, Kim Serafin.</p>
        <p>As Mrs. Clinton campaigned slowly across the state, Mr. Giuliani followed her -- but over the radio, not in person. He gave a series of interviews to upstate radio stations throughout the day, denouncing her qualifications and campaign at every turn.</p>
        <p>In an early morning interview with WBEN in Buffalo, he did address health care in general, saying it was an important issue.</p>
        <p>''My approach to health care is to expand coverage for people,'' Mr. Giuliani said, ''instead of a government-controlled, government-dominated, basically government-run medical program.''</p>
        <p>In an interview with a Rochester station, he mocked Mrs. Clinton's proposals to encourage job development upstate, which include measures to promote Internet access and lower air fares. ''I don't think she has any sense of what is going on in upstate New York,'' he said. ''This information comes from a poll, rather than actually having lived in the state, or being part of the state.</p>
        <p>''On the other hand, I have lived here all my life and have been mayor for seven years,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Also today, the mayor signaled that he did not believe that the Conservative Party endorsement was necessarily closed to him, contending that if the party were to have a  primary, he would win it.</p>
        <p>The party's state chairman, Michael Long, has said he would prefer that Mr. Giuliani not run, all but saying that the mayor would not get the nomination.</p>
