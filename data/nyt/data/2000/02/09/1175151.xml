        <p>Can He Carry Vote As Well as a Tune?</p>
        <p>VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE was saying, ''The occasion is piled high with difficulty,'' adding, ''We must rise with the occasion.'' Another campaign speech? No, those were the words of Abraham Lincoln, and Mr. Gore was the celebrity narrator on the podium Monday night for Aaron Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait,'' in Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center. Cued by LEON BOTSTEIN, conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Gore was the draw at a fund-raising event for charities including the Harlem School of the Arts, Bard College and the New York Housing Authority Symphony Orchestra. After three standing ovations, the audience joined the vice president in a revival-meeting rendition of ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic.''</p>
        <p>''I made sure my microphone wasn't on'' during the singing, the vice president said in a private moment of candor at the post-performance reception. ''I'm not a bad singer, but I'm not ready for Lincoln Center!''</p>
        <p>A Veteran's Strut</p>
        <p>At OZWALD BOATENG'S men's fashion show at the Metropolitan Pavilion the other night, after a parade of suits and shirts in iridescent blues, purples and oranges passed along the catwalk, the last model in the spotlight, wearing a comparatively staid, black suit, received the loudest ovation. Maybe it was the exaggerated walk, part Mick Jagger, part Naomi Campbell. But more likely, it was the fashion crowd, which included the actress ANGIE HARMON, acknowledging LAURENCE FISHBURNE'S first strut down a runway.</p>
        <p>''I used my veteran walk,'' Mr. Fishburne said after the show, where the actors BILLY ZANE and STEPHEN BALDWIN also modeled Mr. Boateng's suits.</p>
        <p>''Veteran walk of which war?'' someone asked.</p>
        <p>''Veteran of my craft, of the stage,'' Mr. Fishburne said with a laugh. ''To me, this is another stage to perform on.''</p>
        <p>But he's not just a suit-and-tie guy. ''I've always loved the rags that Stevie wore,'' said Mr. Fishburne, referring to Stevie Van Zandt, Bruce Springsteen's guitarist, and his custom-made bandannas. ''So I had someone make up a  bunch for me.''</p>
        <p>But Is It a Crime Or a Misdemeanor?</p>
        <p>WOODY ALLEN'S on-screen personas include hypochondriac, sports reporter and human chameleon, but the filmmaker turned up at City Hall yesterday afternoon playing a neighborhood advocate.</p>
        <p>At a hearing held by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, Mr. Allen stepped up to a lectern to testify against a developer's plans to put up a 17-story apartment building on the northeast corner of Madison Avenue and 91st Street, a block away from the building Mr. Allen recently moved into.</p>
        <p>In the self-deprecating style shared by many of his film characters, Mr. Allen noted that he had a losing record when battling on behalf of the community, and joked that local property values had declined since he moved to Carnegie Hill last year. The area, which stretches from 86th to 96th Streets between Fifth and Lexington Avenues, is often depicted in his films, including the one he distributed yesterday to the commission's members: a three-minute video he made.</p>
        <p>Since much of the area is designated a historic district, plans for new buildings must be approved by the landmarks commission.</p>
        <p>Approving the 17-story building, said Mr. Allen, would be ''an egregious mistake'' because it is too tall for the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''It's the wrong building for that site,'' he said. ''This is a beautiful, beautiful, small, human-scale neighborhood, and to suddenly come into it and throw up a 17-story building seems, you know, like an obvious, obvious, awful thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the hearing, architects for the project contended that the plans had already been revised to incorporate the neighborhood's style.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Allen recalled ''an old joke'' about a man drowning a hundred feet from shore who is thrown a 50-foot rope by people claiming that they are ''meeting him halfway.''</p>
