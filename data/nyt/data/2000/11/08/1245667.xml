        <p>Voters in 11 states cast ballots for governor yesterday, and early results showed Democrats prevailing even in some states where Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was defeating Vice President Al Gore in the presidential race.</p>
        <p>Democrats won seven of the governorships, including West Virginia's, the only one to change hands. There Representative Bob Wise defeated the Republican incumbent, Cecil H. Underwood, at 78 the nation's oldest governor. Republicans won two states and two states were still too close to call.</p>

        <p>Voters in 11 states cast ballots for governor yesterday, and early results showed Democrats prevailing even in some states where Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was defeating Vice President Al Gore in the presidential race.</p>
        <p>Democrats won seven of the governorships, including West Virginia's, the only one to change hands. There Representative Bob Wise defeated the Republican incumbent, Cecil H. Underwood, at 78 the nation's oldest governor. Republicans won two states and two states were still too close to call.</p>
        <p>From the very beginning, it was an encouraging night for the Democratic Party, which holds only 18 governorships, compared with 30 for the Republicans. Two more states, Maine and Minnesota, are led by independents.</p>
        <p>Officials in both major parties said the results would say less about any  apparent trend than what results might reveal in 2002, when 36 states hold gubernatorial elections.</p>
        <p>In Indiana, one of the first states claimed by Mr. Bush, Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, a Democrat, was making electoral history, winning a second four-year term by defeating David M. McIntosh, who gave up a safe seat in the House to challenge him. A victory by Mr. O'Bannon would give Democrats 16 consecutive years of leadership in the state for the first time since the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Bannon, who won four years ago with 52 percent of the vote, ran the entire race this year as a front-runner.</p>
        <p>Polling over the last 16 months showed him consistently in the lead over Mr. McIntosh, who was first elected to the House in 1994.</p>
        <p>In North Carolina, another state won by Mr. Bush, a Democratic candidate who tried to keep a concerted distance from Mr. Gore was also prevailing. Mike Easley, the state attorney general, defeated Richard Vinroot, the former Republican mayor of Charlotte, in what was considered the most competitive gubernatorial campaign in North Carolina in 16 years.</p>
        <p>Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., a Democrat, was barred by law from seeking a third four-year term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Easley, who began pulling away in recent polls, called attention to himself among prominent Democrats by his absence from the Democratic National Convention in August. He contended he needed to remain in North Carolina to campaign; the Republican interpretation was that he was avoiding Mr. Gore, who was never especially popular in the state.</p>
        <p>The Democratic governors in two New England states, New Hampshire and Vermont, succeeded in their re-election efforts -- Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire and Howard Dean in Vermont. Mr. Bush won New Hampshire while Mr. Gore won Vermont.</p>
        <p>In winning a third two-year term, Ms. Shaheen held off a former senator, Gordon Humphrey, in a race that was highly contentious, in part over how the state would pay for new education initiatives. Mr. Humphrey  tried to sell the notion that a blue ribbon panel appointed by Ms. Shaheen to devise solutions would result in higher property taxes.</p>
        <p>The only uncertainty about Mr. Dean's projected victory was whether his final vote totals would keep him above 50 percent, which he had in the early results, to avoid a runoff.</p>
        <p>He defeated a Republican challenger, Ruth Dwyer, a former state legislator and her party's 1998 gubernatorial nominee, as well as a Progressive Party candidate, Anthony Pollina, but state law requires the winner to have a clear majority.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore carried Delaware, and so did the Democratic Lieutenant Governor, Ruth Ann Minner, a 65-year-old widow and one-time high school dropout. Leading comfortably in polls through most of the campaign season, she defeated John M. Burris, a Republican and former president of the Delaware Chamber of Commerce. Ms. Minner will succeed Tom Carper, a two-term Democrat who won a seat in the Senate by beating a five-term senator, William V. Roth Jr.</p>
        <p>Among Republican-held seats, results in North Dakota and Utah, both of which Mr. Bush carried, kept them in Republican hands.</p>
        <p>John Hoeven, former president and chief executive of the Bank of North Dakota, easily defeated the state attorney general, Heidi Heitkamp, to succeed Edward T. Schafer, a Republican who is stepping down after two terms.</p>
        <p>Ms. Heitkamp had led in the polls as late as early October, but her lead began to wither, perhaps in part over her disclosure that she was suffering from breast cancer. She ran advertisements to assure voters she was still fit to serve. But by the closing weeks, Mr. Hoeven had taken a six-point lead in a statewide poll that was beyond the margin of sampling error.</p>
        <p>In Utah, an overwhelmingly Republican state, Gov. Michael O. Leavitt cruised to a third four-year term, turning back a former Democratic congressman, Bill Orton. For Mr. Leavitt, it brought to an end a tumultuous campaign season, one in which right-wing members of his own party branded him a liberal for favoring legislation that denied people the right to carry guns into churches and schools.</p>
        <p>Gary Locke, the Democratic governor of Washington, was projected as the winner in his state, fending off a challenge from John Carlson, a Republican radio talk show host who never mounted much of a threat, according to statewide polls.</p>
        <p>Races in two other states, Missouri and Montana, were virtually deadlocked even hours after their polls closed.</p>
