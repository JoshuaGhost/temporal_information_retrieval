        <p>As the polls closed and the Republican Party faithful began to trickle into the Hyatt Regency ballroom here, a rousing five-piece rock band did little tonight to lift the spirits of those who had believed that Representative Bob Franks would upset  his better-financed Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine.</p>
        <p>The mood picked up for a few hours as preliminary returns, projected on large screens, showed the race to be close. But about 11:20 p.m., Mr. Franks suddenly showed up, with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman at his side, to concede.</p>
        <p>In his speech, he assured the crowd that his opponent was ''a good and decent man,'' but managed one more time to voice his misgivings about Mr. Corzine's lavish spending.</p>
        <p>''Although we didn't win tonight, I'm extraordinarily proud of the campaign we ran,'' he said. ''We were outspent 10 to 1. The assault on the airwaves -- it never stopped. The fact is that every pollster and pundit wrote us off months ago, but we never gave up. We stood by our principles.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I lost the election, but what I gained over the course of the past 14 months is something that $60 million will never be able to buy.''</p>
        <p>A lone shout went up from the crowd: ''We love you, Bob.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, Mr. Franks had watched the close returns with his family, sequestered in a hotel room upstairs.</p>
        <p>''Cancel your dinner plans,'' Peter DeMarco, Mr. Franks's spokesman, advised a group of reporters. ''It's going to be a long night.''</p>
        <p>It was a very long night indeed, with emotions swinging wildly as the outcome seemed to teeter between victory and defeat. Even long after a number of news organizations had called the election in Mr. Corzine's favor, supporters of Mr. Franks carried themselves like winners.</p>
        <p>As late as 11:15 p.m., five minutes before Mr. Franks conceded, the cocktails were flowing and the crowd was buzzing with expectation. After a frenzied year of politicking, the last few weeks of it jumping on and off a campaign bus from dawn until long after dusk, Mr. Franks spent most of Election Day with friends and family. He took his 2-year-old daughter, Kelly, to a park, lunched with some friends and then went bowling.</p>
        <p>''This has been a long, hard-fought race,'' said Mr. DeMarco, the campaign spokesman. ''After 14 months of campaigning, he figured he had done everything he could do.''</p>
        <p>Through the campaign, despite the candidates' talk of saving Social Security, stopping sprawl and improving health care, the most gripping issue -- and the most fertile for Mr. Franks -- was Mr. Corzine's money.</p>
        <p>''After a while, Corzine's money became a negative, and I think the money issue overshadowed their differences, which are considerable,'' said Gerald M. Pomper, a political scientist at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>For many months, most voters did not seem to care that Mr. Corzine, a political neophyte, was spending nearly $1 million a week of his own money on television commercials, campaign literature and consultants. In a New York Times poll three weeks ago, nearly two-thirds of those interviewed said his spending made no difference to them; Mr. Corzine led by 12 percentage points. But later surveys showed a tightening race.</p>
        <p>It was a long road for Mr. Franks, 49, who was an assemblyman for seven terms before being elected to Congress in 1992. Although he promoted a moderate social agenda, including support for abortion rights and limited gun control, Mr. Corzine tried to make hay out of his voting record in the House, which sometimes mirrored the more conservative views of the former speaker, Newt Gingrich.</p>
        <p>From the outset, Mr. Franks seemed to be running uphill. A four-way Republican primary in June was bruising and financially draining. And because it was largely drowned out by the Democratic runoff between Mr. Corzine and Jim Florio, Mr. Franks did not emerge as a household name.</p>
        <p>Some Republican leaders in New Jersey and elsewhere, disappointed by Governor Whitman's decision to back out of a Senate run, viewed Mr. Franks as a second-stringer and gave him lukewarm support.</p>
        <p>Faced with Mr. Corzine's daunting wealth -- and the fact that New Jersey had not elected a Republican senator in 26 years -- party rainmakers turned off the spigot, leaving Mr. Franks to make do with a campaign budget that until recently hovered around $3 million.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Franks's resources grew to nearly $6 million, thanks to a last-minute surge of donations, Mr. Corzine, by Election Day's end, had  probably spent $60 million. Mr. Franks's first television commercials began only two weeks ago, three months after Mr. Corzine's.</p>
        <p>Short on cash, the campaign learned to rely on extensive glad-handing, Mr. DeMarco said. As a raft of newspaper endorsements buoyed Mr. Franks's prospects, the money began to flow more freely, allowing the campaign to buy television time. Many of those ads focused on Mr. Corzine's spending.</p>
        <p>In the end, the voters decided that Mr Corzine's money was not the paramount issue. But for Governor Whitman, the race signaled a need for change. ''If we come away with no other overall message,'' she said, ''we need to look seriously at campaign finance reform and how we can get the cost of elections under control so people can participate without being a multimillionaire.''</p>
