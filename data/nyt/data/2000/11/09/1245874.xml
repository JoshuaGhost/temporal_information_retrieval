        <p>Unnerved slightly by the unresolved presidential election and concerned about a slowdown in profit growth for technology stocks, investors sent the American financial markets lower in tepid trading yesterday.</p>
        <p>For much of the day, the unanswered question of whether Gov. George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore would replace Bill Clinton in the White House did not seem to bother investors.</p>
        <p>Stocks opened broadly higher, though the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index quickly turned sour after an analyst published a negative report on optical networking companies, some of the Nasdaq's most important stocks.</p>
        <p>But stocks slid lower throughout the afternoon and closed down across the board. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 22.59 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,409.28, while the Nasdaq plunged 184.09 points, or 5.4 percent, to 3,231.70. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 45.12 points, to 10,907.06, a 0.4 percent drop. Treasury bonds and the dollar showed little change.</p>
        <p>Investors still appear to believe that Mr. Bush will win, since cigarette and energy companies and drug makers, which are perceived as likely to benefit if Mr. Bush is elected, all rose. Philip Morris, the leading tobacco company, rose $1.75, to $36.75, while the drug maker Merck leaped $3.81, to $90.81.</p>
        <p>But the closeness of Tuesday's vote has denied either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore a mandate for their proposals, professional stock strategists and money managers said. After a day of uncertainty, Wall Street does not particularly care who wins, as long as the election is quickly resolved, they said.</p>
        <p>''Markets hate uncertainty,'' said Fred Kobrick, chief executive of Kobrick Funds, which manages more than $1 billion. ''This was a worry day; a lack of leadership; don't know where the market is going; may take forever to get a president.''</p>
        <p>In another sign of Wall Street's confusion, Microsoft, which investors believe would benefit from a Bush victory, rose as high as $72.38, a $1.88 rise, before giving up its gains on broader concerns about technology stocks. It closed the day at $69.44, down $1.06. Other technology companies fared much worse.</p>
        <p>The chip maker Intel sagged $3.50, to $42.69, while the computer storage manufacturer EMC slid $7.50, to $90.</p>
        <p>Optical networking equipment companies, which are among the most highly valued and volatile Nasdaq stocks, fell heavily in the face of a report from Bluestone Capital that warned of waning demand and called the stocks overpriced.</p>
        <p>Cisco Systems fell $4.63, to $52.13, while Juniper Networks plunged $22.50, to $188.19.</p>
        <p>The weakness in technology stocks was mainly unrelated to the election, said Byron Wien, strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ''There were still some excesses in the Nasdaq,'' Mr. Wien said. But he warned that the markets were likely to remain unsettled until Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore was declared the winner.</p>
        <p>Once that happens, investors may return to stocks again, said Charles Pradilla, chief investment officer at SG Cowen. Like other analysts, Mr. Pradilla assumes that the close election means more gridlock in Washington, with neither big tax cuts nor big new spending programs on the horizon.</p>
        <p>And with the United States in the midst of the longest economic expansion in its history, investors should be happy with a stalemate, he said. ''This is the best of all possible results,'' Mr. Pradilla said. ''The background economics remain superb, and if you want to keep those unmolested, this political outcome is the best that you could have.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street's conventional wisdom is that a Bush victory will provide a short-term boon for stocks, especially those of the drug makers, tobacco companies, health maintenance organizations, energy companies and military contractors.</p>
        <p>Neil B. Sweig, an analyst at Ryan, Beck &amp; Company, said drug stocks rose yesterday because investors continued to believe that Mr. Bush would win. But if Mr. Gore is declared the winner, ''drug stocks will come crashing down,'' he said. ''We're truly in a twilight zone.''</p>
        <p>A Bush victory might hurt bonds, because the big tax cut that Mr. Bush has proposed could eat up the federal government's surplus. Such a tax cut could also stimulate excessive economic growth and inflationary pressures, forcing the Federal Reserve's policy makers to raise short-term interest rates to slow the economy.</p>
        <p>Financial stocks, which might suffer if rates rise, also dropped slightly, though it was unclear whether the drop was related to fears of a Bush tax cut or broader investor unease about the election. Chase Manhattan dropped $1.26, to $43.63, while Citigroup dropped $1.69, to $53.06.</p>
        <p>Because stocks are unlikely to rise for very long if bond yields increase and prices fall, investor euphoria over a Bush victory may not last, said Hugh Johnson, chairman and president of First Albany Asset Management, which invests $630 million.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush wins, ''life is going to be made more difficult for the Federal Reserve,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, bond investors may view a Gore victory as more positive for bonds, because Mr. Gore has proposed smaller tax cuts than Mr. Bush has.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore has unnerved some investors, who are concerned he may be unfriendly to business. Mr. Gore proposed an expansion in Medicare prescription drug benefits that the pharmaceutical industry fears and has sharply attacked big oil companies. He is also part of an administration that has sued to force the breakup of Microsoft.</p>
        <p>Now, neither candidate can claim much support for his proposals, Mr. Johnson said. ''There's pretty clearly no mandate -- that's the understatement of the year,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Gore wins, he will have to work with Republican majorities in both the House and Senate to pass legislation, which will force sides to moderate their policies, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Bush wins, the Republicans will control the presidency and the Congress for the first time since the 1953-1955 period.</p>
        <p>But they will have tiny majorities in both houses of Congress, and Mr. Bush will have won despite receiving a minority of the popular vote. That hardly indicates overwhelming support for Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts, said Jeff Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
        <p>''The notion that Congress is going to pass a $1.3 trillion tax cut in the first three months of 2001 is just out the window,'' Mr. Applegate said. ''Rather than a landslide, we got a mudslide -- a mudslide that effectively submerges the prospect of any significant change in U.S. fiscal policy.''</p>
