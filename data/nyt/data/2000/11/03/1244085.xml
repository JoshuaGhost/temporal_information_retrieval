        <p>The campaign of Hillary Rodham Clinton last night began televising this 30-second advertisement, ''Exactly,'' in New York City.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Callahan Creative</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- Clips of Mrs. Clinton's opponent, Rick A. Lazio, speaking during the Senate candidates' first debate in Buffalo as well as blurry, slow-motion footage of him at a news conference with Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. Some of the announcer's text also appears, including the final word, ''Exactly.'' Newspaper articles about themes raised in the text are also shown.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Lazio: ''It is not what you say, it's what you actually do.'' Announcer: ''O.K., Rick Lazio said ----'' Mr. Lazio: ''Right here, right here, sign it, sign it.'' Announcer: ''But then he broke the soft-money agreement. Lazio said he was a moderate, but he was Newt Gingrich's deputy whip for four years. Voted for the largest education and Medicare cuts in history. Lazio said he'd run a positive campaign . . . but he's been caught making 500,000 'reprehensible' phone calls.'' Mr. Lazio: ''It's not what you say . . . it's what you actually do.'' Announcer: ''Exactly.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The agreement by Mr. Lazio and Mrs. Clinton to stop their use of the unregulated contributions known as soft money for television ads was never committed to writing and therefore has been open to interpretation. But both sides said political parties would not use soft money to buy ads on their behalf. Mr. Lazio insisted that the two ads paid in part by the national Republican Party were allowed by the agreement, and they technically were not financed by soft money. Mr. Lazio returned the party's money. He favored proposals by the House Republican leadership in 1995 that would have sharply cut education financing, but he also voted for the most recent federal budget, which allocates a record amount of aid for public education. He  supported reducing the growth in Medicare financing, not cutting Medicare itself. The telephone campaign was run by the state Republican Party, not Mr. Lazio, though he said he agreed with it.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- This is one of the few negative ads in the campaign. It uses several production techniques to try to portray Mr. Lazio in a menacing way. Use of the scene during the debate when he approached Mrs. Clinton's lectern is a reminder to voters of Mr. Lazio's actions, which were roundly criticized as too aggressive. The ad effectively makes its central point:  that Mr. Lazio should be judged by his actions, not his words on some of the race's highest visibility issues. It uses sloppy shorthand, however, to characterize his record, and its production techniques suggest a highly negative approach.</p>
