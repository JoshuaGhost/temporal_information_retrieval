        <p>The Quaker Oats Company informally rejected a $13.7 billion offer to be acquired by PepsiCo yesterday, according to executives close to the negotiations. Executives of the two consumer products giants had been meeting privately to discuss a sale, but could not agree on a price.</p>
        <p>It is unclear whether the talks will resume. An executive close to PepsiCo suggested that the company would most likely abandon its attempt to take over Quaker Oats, whose brands include Rice-a-Roni, Aunt Jemima, Cap'n Crunch and Gatorade, the product that Pepsi most coveted because of its market dominance.</p>
        <p>Pepsi, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., offered 2.2 of its shares for each Quaker Oats share, the executives said. That would value Quaker's shares at $103.68, or 26 percent above yesterday's closing price, but Quaker Oats executives rejected the offer as insufficient, the executives said. Executives close to Pepsi said it was unlikely the company, the No. 2 soda maker, would return with a higher offer.</p>
        <p>Without a deal with PespsiCo, Quaker Oats could become the target of a fierce bidding war from rival suitors like Coca-Cola, Nestle and Danone.</p>
        <p>Shares of Quaker Oats closed yesterday at $82.25 on the New York Stock Exchange, unchanged from Wednesday. Shares of PepsiCo fell 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $47.13 yesterday in New York.</p>
        <p>In addition to Pepsi Cola, PepsiCo makes Tropicana Pure Premium orange juice, Lay's and Doritos chips and Rold Gold pretzels.</p>
        <p>It remains unclear whether PepsiCo would have kept all of Quaker Oats' product lines or sold off brands like Rice-a-Roni and Aunt Jemima. The executives hinted that some brands would certainly be auctioned off if a deal were completed.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for PepsiCo declined to comment. A spokesman for Quaker Oats could not be reached.</p>
        <p>The offer epitomizes PepsiCo's unbridled thrust to stake out a commanding position in the noncarbonated beverage industry, a fast-growing frontier that soft drink makers have traditionally been slow to explore but have been forced to take seriously in recent years.</p>
        <p>At a time when soda sales in the United States are stagnant and show few signs of rejuvenation, sales of juices and sports drinks have been growing more than 8 percent a year. Gatorade, the clear leader in the field with a market share of more than 83 percent, has done even better, racing along at nearly 12 percent this year.</p>
        <p>For months, investors have been clamoring for soft drink companies to either buy such promising juice, tea and other nonbubbly brands or develop their own. But while Coca-Cola continues to be distracted by a painful reorganization process that has included layoffs of roughly 18 percent of its work force, Pepsi is seizing every opportunity to nip at the heels of its larger rival.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Pepsi announced that it had purchased a 90 percent stake in the South Beach Beverage Company, the maker of the still-small but increasingly popular SoBe juices and teas, for $370 million in cash. Coke officials had been entrenched in unsuccessful negotiations to buy a stake in the drink manufacturer for months. As soon as the talks broke down, Pepsi officials swooped in and struck a deal.</p>
        <p>If Pepsi were to acquire Gatorade, the challenge to Coke would be far more serious. Sales of Gatorade topped $1.8 billion last year, compared with $4.4 billion for Pepsi drinks. If PepsiCo grabs it, analysts say, there will be few comparable brands in the noncarbonated segment left for Coke to acquire.</p>
        <p>''If Pepsi does this, it's a hugely aggressive deal,'' said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter. ''Gatorade is a gem of a brand.''</p>
        <p>Some analysts feel that Coke, moving cautiously to avoid conflicts with the Federal Trade Commission, has missed out on a series of acquisitions in the industry's biggest growth areas. In a $910 million deal last month, Cadbury-Schweppes bought Snapple, a brand that Quaker bought in 1994 for roughly $1.7 billion and sold for just $300 million a few years later after stifling its growth.</p>
        <p>Without Snapple in Quaker's portfolio, a deal could be less likely to conflict with regulators should one be reached. But Pepsi does own All-Sport, a drink in the same category as Gatorade, but has been losing market share recently.</p>
        <p>Analysts also speculate that Pepsi would be apt to sell off some of Quaker's food businesses as well, particularly in cereals, a market that has been stagnant recently and shows few signs of a turnaround.</p>
