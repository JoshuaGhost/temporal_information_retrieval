        <p>As far as I'm concerned, the issues are simple. I work at home. I am never not working. My apartment is small, one bedroom and you have to go through it to get to the bathroom. The measure of my hospitality therefore depends on two things: an extremely close relationship to the invitees and their willingness to see Washington on their own.</p>
        <p>The attractions of Washington are well known, widely advertised and best of all, mostly free. Walk on the Mall between Smithsonians and what you see are happy tourists, even those with children too small to endure that much constructive fun. In museums and monuments and pure green lushness, the nation's capital can't be beat and never disappoints. Everybody should come here. I have a guidebook, handily slim.</p>

        <p>As far as I'm concerned, the issues are simple. I work at home. I am never not working. My apartment is small, one bedroom and you have to go through it to get to the bathroom.

        <p>The attractions of Washington are well known, widely advertised and best of all, mostly free. Walk on the Mall between Smithsonians and what you see are happy tourists, even those with children too small to endure that much constructive fun. In museums and monuments and pure green lushness, the nation's capital can't be beat and never disappoints. Everybody should come here. I have a guidebook, handily slim.</p>
        <p>But I may or may not want to go along. I've been to the Holocaust Museum and someday I'll go back. But not yet.</p>
        <p>Now, make no mistake, I love my friends and I love my family and one of the first things I did when I moved into this apartment was to buy a pull-out couch. I want my beloveds to come see me. And so to prevent crabbiness on my part, I provide a fare card for our superb underground public transportation system. I may even accompany my guests down to Connecticut Avenue and show them how it works. Maybe we'll stop for coffee and a muffin at my favorite haunt, the Firehook Bakery -- my treat.</p>
        <p>And then they go. And I walk back home. And when they return, I graciously offer tea or wine and little tidbits and they tell of their day and we go out together or cook together or -- whatever the evening brings. And sometimes I sleep on the couch and give them my bed, and everyone feels fine and happy and we all sleep just very well indeed.</p>
