        <p>Republican state lawmakers here are homing in on an obscure, never used federal statute that, they contend, could offer them a decisive hand in choosing Florida's precious 25 electors if the normal voting process somehow leaves the outcome unclear.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, presidential electors are chosen through the popular vote and are expected to cast their ballots for the winning candidate.

        <p>Republican state lawmakers here are homing in on an obscure, never used federal statute that, they contend, could offer them a decisive hand in choosing Florida's precious 25 electors if the normal voting process somehow leaves the outcome unclear.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, presidential electors are chosen through the popular vote and are expected to cast their ballots for the winning candidate. But Republican leaders, who control both houses of the State Legislature, say they are examining a federal law  that they believe gives them power to seat electors if the outcome of the popular vote in Florida is unclear. The development was first reported Friday by The Pensacola News Journal and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>''The specter is raised,' said Tom Feeney, a state representative from Oviedo expected to be elected as speaker of the House on Tuesday. ''If the courts don't allow the executive branch to do their duty, then at some point we would have to review our constitutional responsibilities.''</p>
        <p>''At this point we're watching and waiting,'' Mr. Feeney added.</p>
        <p>Electors must be seated by Dec. 12. Republicans and Democrats interviewed today said they hoped the matter would be resolved long before then. But if that did not happen, Republican lawmakers said today that they could invoke the federal statute. They were far from certain exactly how to apply the law, and they said they were looking at retaining election law experts to help them wade through the statute.</p>
        <p>In fact, only one thing seemed certain today: The Republicans were sorely disappointed that the Florida Supreme Court on Friday enjoined the secretary of state, Katherine Harris, from certifying her state's vote -- an act that could have put Florida's 25 electoral votes in the Bush camp, pending the outcome of other lawsuits.</p>
        <p>Johnny Byrd, a Republican state representative from Plant City, added, ''If the secretary of state is still under an injunction at noon on Tuesday, at that point it's just a question of when to pull the trigger.''</p>
        <p>The trigger he is referring to is the Republicans' interpretation of Title 3, Section 2 of the United States code.</p>
        <p>''Whenever any state has held an election for the purpose of choosing electors and has failed to make a choice on the day prescribed by law,'' the law reads, ''the electors may be appointed on a subsequent day in such a manner as the Legislature of such state may direct.''</p>
        <p>The law has never been used, and by all accounts it is most likely to invite a bitter political tussle.</p>
        <p>''To end an election with the Legislature taking over for the will of the people, that would be politically very risky,'' Lois Frankel, a Democratic state representative from West Palm Beach, said today.</p>
        <p>Indeed, she added, she was doubtful of the prospect. ''I can't even imagine why they would want to go there,'' Ms. Frankel said. ''It almost leaves me speechless.''</p>
        <p>The state Republicans' latest announcement was seen by some, though, as political posturing to speed up a political compromise. The fact that the Legislature is considering intervening may accelerate the process of reaching a comprehensive compromise, said John Shubin, an election lawyer from Miami.</p>
