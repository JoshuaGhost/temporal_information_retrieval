        <p>Citing what it said were numerous telephone threats, including a bomb threat, Toronto-based Cuba Cruise Corporation recently announced an indefinite postponement of its inaugural cruise between Nassau and Havana on its 400-passenger Habana, scheduled for yesterday.</p>
        <p>Sam Blyth, the president of Cuba Cruise, said that the threats made it impossible to guarantee the safety and security of passengers and crew, and he promised full refunds for passengers already booked.</p>
        <p>''There has been continuous harassment, for months and months and months,'' said Mr. Blyth, who also owns a Toronto travel company. Pending an investigation by Canadian authorities, he added, he was not at liberty to disclose when or under what circumstances the threats occurred. But he said they increased after President Clinton signed a law three weeks ago that retained longstanding restrictions on travel to Cuba.</p>
        <p>To comply with United States regulations covering travel to Cuba, the cruises, scheduled to depart twice a week, were to have featured educational programs and seminars on Cuban history and culture. During their stay in Cuba, American passengers were to have been guests of the Center for Education and Training, a nonprofit Canadian organization specializing in high school courses for adults.</p>
        <p>Because of the cruises' educational component, and because the Americans would be nonpaying guests of Canadian hosts on the island, Cuba Cruise said the voyages did not violate American law, including a Treasury Department prohibition against the spending of money in Cuba.</p>
        <p>Last May, the second of two around-the-world voyages of the World Cruise Company, also headed by Mr. Blyth, was aborted in Papeete, Tahiti, stranding some 140 passengers, according to Mr. Blyth. He attributed the cancellation and the World Cruise Company's subsequent bankruptcy to problems with the delivery of a ship the company had planned to use, as well as high fuel prices. Refunds for canceled Cuba cruises, he said, can be obtained by calling (416) 964-2569.</p>
