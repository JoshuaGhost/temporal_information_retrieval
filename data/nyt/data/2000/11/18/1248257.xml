        <p>Today's KEY GAMES</p>
        <p>NO. 4 FLORIDA 9-1  NO. 2 at FLORIDA STATE 10-1  As always, the stakes are high. If Florida State wins, it should move up in the Bowl Championship Series rating and get into the national-championship game. Florida is headed for a major bowl, too. The main concerns are Florida State at running back, where three players were injured last week, and Florida at quarterback, where Jesse Palmer and Rex Grossman will both play. TV: CH7, 8:00 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 12 OREGON 10-1  NO. 8 at OREGON STATE 9-1  For the first time ever, when these old rivals meet, both are in the running for the Rose Bowl. If Oregon wins, it goes. If Oregon State wins, it goes only if Washington loses to Washington State, which is unlikely. Oregon has won its last eight games. Oregon State has won its last eight home games. TV: CH7, 3:30 P.M.</p>

        <p>Today's KEY GAMES</p>

The main concerns are Florida State at running back, where three players were injured last week, and Florida at quarterback, where Jesse Palmer and Rex Grossman will both play.

If Oregon State wins, it goes only if Washington loses to Washington State, which is unlikely. Oregon has won its last eight games. Oregon State has won its last eight home games. TV: CH7, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>NO. 23 MICHIGAN 7-3  NO. 16 at OHIO STATE 8-2  Michigan, Ohio State, Purdue and Northwestern are tied for the Big Ten lead. Michigan and its big offense can sneak into the Rose Bowl only if Purdue and Northwestern lose, a long shot at best. If Purdue loses, Ohio State and its big defense are still alive. TV: CH7, Noon</p>
        <p>NO. 3 MIAMI 8-1  at SYRACUSE 5-4  If Miami beats Syracuse and Boston College in its last two games, as expected, it may be bound for the national-championship game. Syracuse can land in a bowl by beating Miami (tough) or Rutgers (easy). TV: espn, 6:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>EAST  No. 7 Notre Dame (7-2)  at Rutgers (3-6)  If Notre Dame gets by Rutgers and Southern California, it has a strong shot at the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl. TV: CH2, 3:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Michigan State (5-5)  at Penn State (4-7)  Michigan State must win to get a bowl bid. It could stumble here as Penn State tries to salvage something from Coach Joe Paterno's worst season.</p>
        <p>Alabama-Birmingham (6-4)  at Army (1-8)  A lost season for Army, even if it beats Navy.</p>
        <p>Penn (6-3)  at Cornell (5-4)  They are tied at 5-1 for the Ivy League lead, and the winner becomes the champion.</p>
        <p>Yale (6-3)  at Harvard (5-4)  Despite winning records, this has been a frustrating season for both.</p>
        <p>Columbia (3-6)  at Brown (6-3)  Brown's passing game could make this one-sided.</p>
        <p>Lehigh (10-0)  at Lafayette (2-8)  This the 136th game in college football's most played rivalry.</p>
        <p>SOUTH</p>
        <p>No. 14 Auburn (8-2)  at Alabama (3-7)  If Auburn wins, the Citrus Bowl may come calling. If Alabama loses, it will end its worst season since 0-10 in 1955.</p>
        <p>Arkansas (4-5)  at No. 10 Mississippi State (7-2)  Mississippi State's strong offense faces a shaky defense.</p>
        <p>No. 11 Georgia Tech (7-2)  at Maryland (5-5)  Georgia Tech shut out Virginia with 627 yards in total offense, 34 first downs, no turnovers and no punts.</p>
        <p>Kentucky (2-8)  at No. 17 Tennessee (6-3)  In routing Arkansas, Tennessee got five touchdown passes from Casey Clausen and improved running.</p>
        <p>South Carolina (7-3)  at Clemson (8-2)  Despite losing to Georgia Tech and Florida State in its last two games, Clemson is headed for the Gator Bowl.</p>
        <p>MIDWEST</p>
        <p>Indiana (3-7)  at Purdue (7-3)  If Purdue wins, and it should win comfortably, it is Rose Bowl bound.</p>
        <p>Illinois (5-5) at Northwestern (7-3)  If Purdue and Ohio State lose, Northwestern goes to the Rose Bowl.  TV: ESPN2, Noon</p>
        <p>No. 13 Kansas State (9-2)  at Missouri (3-7)  A victory by Kansas State clinches the Big 12 North and a probable rematch with Oklahoma for the conference title.</p>
        <p>SOUTHWEST</p>
        <p>Texas Tech (7-4)  at No. 1 Oklahoma (9-0)  Oklahoma needed a 22-point fourth quarter to beat Texas A&amp;M.</p>
        <p>No. 24 Texas-El Paso (8-2)  at Texas Christian (8-1)  T.C.U., which had hoped for bigger, is headed back to the Mobile Alabama Bowl.</p>
        <p>FAR WEST</p>
        <p>No. 6 Washington (9-1)  at Washington State (4-6)  Washington's Rose Bowl fate is out of its hands.  TV: MSG, 6:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>Southern California (4-6)  at U.C.L.A. (6-4)  Southern California is doomed to the Pacific 10 cellar.</p>
        <p>Stanford (4-6)  at California (3-7)  The Big Game. California can be tough, as Oregon State and Oregon learned the last two weeks.</p>
