        <p>Fountain of Folly</p>
        <p>Q.: Until about 10 years ago, a towering jet of water issued from a tiny structure at Roosevelt Island's southern tip. What happened to it?</p>
        <p>A.: Upon its completion in 1969, the Delacorte Fountain, as the geyser was known, was almost immediately shut down by the commissioner of health, who insisted that East River water was too polluted to shoot hundreds of feet into the atmosphere every day. After an elaborate chlorination system was installed, the geyser blossomed twice a day, from noon to 2 p.m. and from 8 to 10 p.m., when it was illuminated by a circle of eight floodlights.</p>
        <p>George T. Delacorte, the philanthropist and founder of the Dell Publishing Company, donated the fountain to the city, at a cost of over $400,000. It was designed by the architects Pomerance &amp; Breines and patterned after the 425-foot Jet d'Eau in Lake Geneva. The Worthington Pump Company of Newark designed a two-tiered system -- an 800-horsepower horizontal stroke pump and a 700-horsepower submerged vertical turbine -- that forced 4,000 gallons of water a minute through a four-inch diameter nozzle and into the sky. It was said that the plume was twice the height of Old Faithful.</p>
        <p>A steeply roofed, stainless-steel building, designed to take the full weight of the falling water column, housed the engineering works. To prevent water from spraying the shores of Manhattan or Queens, a wind-measurement device automatically shut off the pumps when gusts exceeded 12 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Scorned by critics, plagued by mechanical breakdowns and threatened by a succession of development schemes, the fountain lasted less than 20 years. In 1986 it was alleged that the mist from the plume threatened a newly planted grove of pines at the island's southern tip, and after a final breakdown, it was not repaired. The problem with the mist  was that it was chlorinated.</p>
        <p>Mansion and Steamship</p>
        <p>Q.: I have always assumed that Claremont Avenue in Manhattan was named after Robert Fulton's pioneering steamship of that name. Am I mistaken?</p>
        <p>A.: So it would seem. Claremont, which runs from 116th Street to Tiemann Place in Morningside Heights, takes its name from the old Claremont Mansion, a rambling country estate built at the turn of the 18th century in what is now Riverside Park, overlooking the Hudson. After the house was bought by Michael Hogan, a wealthy Irish immigrant, he named it, and the hill on which it stood, for County Clare, his native land, and for Claremont Castle in Surrey, England. Coincidentally, perhaps, it was on the nearby Hudson in 1807 that Robert Fulton first piloted his similarly named steamship -- the Clermont.</p>
        <p>The green-trimmed, white-framed manor house, which stood on a site just above Grant's Tomb, was converted to a restaurant and inn before the Civil War, and remained a popular destination for uptown excursions for almost a century. It was demolished, after a fire, in 1951.</p>
        <p>Self-Portrait in Bar</p>
        <p>Q.: Bemelmans  Bar, in the Carlyle Hotel on Madison Avenue and 76th Street, has long been associated with Ludwig Bemelmans, who painted the ochre walls with animal scenes while living in the hotel in the mid-1940's. I'm told that the artist actually painted himself in one scene, but where?</p>
        <p>A.: In exchange for free rent, Bemelmans -- author of the popular Madeline books -- spent 18 months covering the bar with his hurried, painterly cartoons, and several friends and frequent patrons are portrayed there. He depicted himself as a waiter or bartender holding a bill, and can be found a few feet to the right as you face the cash register.</p>
