        <p>EVERY May, bus drivers from companies throughout the state hold rodeos: competitions in which they turn, park, back up, stop and maneuver an ordinary passenger bus along an obstacle course, coming within five inches of traffic cones, barrels and tennis balls without touching them.</p>
        <p>Winners of regional competitions go to the state rodeos, where the best driver gets a $500 savings bond, a monogrammed jacket and a free trip to the North American city that is host for the that year's International Bus Rodeo (it's international because Canadian drivers also compete).</p>

        <p>EVERY May, bus drivers from companies throughout the state hold rodeos: competitions in which they turn, park, back up, stop and maneuver an ordinary passenger bus along an obstacle course, coming within five inches of traffic cones, barrels and tennis balls without touching them.</p>
        <p>Winners of regional competitions go to the state rodeos, where the best driver gets a $500 savings bond, a monogrammed jacket and a free trip to the North American city that is host for the that year's International Bus Rodeo (it's international because Canadian drivers also compete).</p>
        <p>In six years with New Jersey Transit, Daniel Bruey of Hammonton has won the state rodeo four times, driving a 1995 49-seat ''city style'' New Jersey Transit bus. In 1999 he finished in third place at the International in Orlando, Fla. On Sept. 27 of this year, he finished fourth in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''You have to have the desire to want to do it,'' said Mr. Bruey, who is currently driving on Route 319 between Atlantic City and the Port Authority Terminal in Manhattan. ''You need to focus and you'd better not hit anything.''</p>
        <p>Speed as well as accuracy are measured at the International Rodeo sponsored by the International American Public Transportation Association, a Washington trade organization and mass-transit lobbying firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruey's best time so far has been just under 7 minutes. His best event: the twisting, swerving ''serpentine.''</p>
        <p>''That's when I can pretend I'm skiing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>There is a $1,000 cash prize, but Mr. Bruey said pride, not money, is his objective.</p>
        <p>''My son Joshua is 2 years old and he just loves buses,'' he said. ''The International will be in Philadelphia next year and I want him there with me when I win.''</p>
