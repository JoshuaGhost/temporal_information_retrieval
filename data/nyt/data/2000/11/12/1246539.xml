        <p>VICTORIA NESNICK, a schoolteacher for 30 years,  could not understand why there was a hall of fame for cockroaches and not one for children. So she quit her job in the Bethpage school district and began working full time on the Kids Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>While the cockroach tribute has an actual physical location in Texas, Ms. Nesnick's project now consists of a quarterly newsletter, three rooms in her Dix Hills home and a Web site (www.thekidshalloffame.com). She expects to offer trading cards soon and books detailing the accomplishments of young achievers, with a museum as the ultimate goal.</p>

        <p>VICTORIA NESNICK, a schoolteacher for 30 years,  could not understand why there was a hall of fame for cockroaches and not one for children. So she quit her job in the Bethpage school district and began working full time on the Kids Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>While the cockroach tribute has an actual physical location in Texas, Ms. Nesnick's project now consists of a quarterly newsletter, three rooms in her Dix Hills home and a Web site (www.thekidshalloffame.com). She expects to offer trading cards soon and books detailing the accomplishments of young achievers, with a museum as the ultimate goal.</p>
        <p>''In all the years I was teaching, I saw that adults were being held up as role models,'' she said. ''What kids need and want are peer role models.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nesnick first approached the Disney corporation and its publishing arm, Hyperion, with her book-series idea. She also discussed creating a pavilion dedicated to children's accomplishments. ''They were not as receptive as I would have liked,'' Ms. Nesnick recalled with a laugh. So she decided to pursue her idea on her own, beginning with a newsletter.</p>
        <p>In 1997, she retired and took on the project full time. The next year, she and her husband, Robert, began the business with minimal assets. She collected stories about extraordinary children and included them in a four-page newsletter that was distributed to her board of advisers, which included educators, business people, , psychologists, authors, parents, a Nassau County judge and a student.</p>
        <p>The concept soon caught on. She received financing from local businesses like Computer Associates, which donated several used computers and printers. Within two years the newsletter grew to 40 pages and the circulation rose to 8,000, some of it paid subscriptions. It is distributed to 67 public libraries on Long Island (and a few in Florida), as well as to school districts and Parent-Teacher Associations statewide. Mr. Nesnick, assisted by a friend, Nancy Liepa, serves as copy editor.</p>
        <p>Approximately 50 children have been spotlighted in the newsletters and Web site, and Ms. Nesnick said that, surprisingly, most had not been submitted by pushy parents. Nominations are accepted if they fill the criterion of notable achievement, and only two have been rejected.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nesnick, 55, said that while she herself was not a distinguished child, her daughter, Amy Gilvary, now 25, was -- and although Ms. Gilvary was never inducted into the Kids Hall of Fame, she helped inspire it.</p>
        <p>The first child featured by Ms. Nesnick was a scholar, Jennifer Mazzoli, formerly of Smithtown, now living in Florida. Children are nominated by their parents, teachers, organizations and even themselves.</p>
        <p>Honorees include Jonathan Estrada, who at 2 years old was able to identify all the states; At 4, he chewed out the shape of the states from cheese slices, leaving a tooth mark where the capital was located. Clinton Brown III of Hicksville is a gold-medalist disabled athlete who starred in several Emmy-winning documentaries. He carried the Olympic torch in Atlanta in 1996. There are inventors, chefs, singers and even historical figures like Louis Braille.</p>
        <p>''You have to achieve something that has to be above and beyond what's typically expected of kids that age or in that particular situation,'' Ms. Nesnick said. 'We are not looking for kids who win medals in soccer.'</p>
        <p>The Kids Hall of Fame is a labor of love for Ms. Nesnick, who makes no money from it, but hopes eventually to turn it into a profitable business. It is not a vanity press, nor are there nomination fees.</p>
        <p>''You can't buy a nomination,'' said Ms. Nesnick. ''It's an honor that's earned.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Nesnick hopes to connect with celebrity child advocates like Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell, who can help her evolve from newsletters to books, and eventually a museum.</p>
        <p>''''I don't understand why, as adults, we read books on the keys to success,'' Ms. Nesnick said. ''Why not learn those habits as children, so that the keys to success are ingrained? When children read these stories about their peers, they will know that they can achieve the same things. It bothers me when people ask a child, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' It gives the sense that they are nothing now. We should ask, 'What are you now?' ''</p>
