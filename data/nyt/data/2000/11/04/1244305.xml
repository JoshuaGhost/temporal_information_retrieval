        <p>As a not-so-recent immigrant to this country, I doubt that the ''recent  immigrants'' in Eugenie Allen's children's school are as ''bewildered'' by the school-supplies list as she is (Op-Ed, Oct. 28).</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a not-so-recent immigrant to this country, I doubt that the ''recent  immigrants'' in Eugenie Allen's children's school are as ''bewildered'' by the school-supplies list as she is (Op-Ed, Oct. 28).</p>
        <p>I grew up in Romania and attended two years of private primary school and the rest of my pre-college years in public school under the Communist government. Not only were we expected to carry our own pencil boxes, but we also had to buy our textbooks every year. Back-to-school shopping meant trips to the stationery and bookstores, not to the mall for a new wardrobe.</p>
        <p>Yet as children, most of us enjoyed buying stationery and reading books (though not necessarily textbooks, which were tainted with propaganda). ''Technological'' innovations, like a mechanical pencil someone might have received from America, were used as currency for bribes and barter.</p>
