        <p>AT&amp;T, under pressure to reduce its holdings in the cable industry, said yesterday that it planned to spin off Liberty Media, the company that owns stakes in programming companies and is controlled by the entrepreneur John C. Malone.</p>
        <p>Liberty Media now trades as an AT&amp;T tracking stock but operates independently. AT&amp;T plans to convert the Liberty shares into a new publicly traded stock in the second quarter of 2001, assuming a favorable tax ruling. AT&amp;T will own no stake in Liberty after the spinoff.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T acquired Liberty Media as part of its purchase of Tele-Communications Inc. in March 1999. With Liberty a tracking stock of AT&amp;T, Mr. Malone has grown increasingly unhappy with AT&amp;T's poor performance and the constraints placed on Liberty because of its affiliation with the struggling phone giant.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Malone has been outspoken in his displeasure with AT&amp;T, where he holds 0.86 percent of its shares and sits on the board, the impetus for the Liberty spinoff comes as much from the Federal Communications Commission as from Mr. Malone.</p>
        <p>When AT&amp;T bought MediaOne in June, after first acquiring Tele-Communications Inc., the commission said AT&amp;T had to reduce its power in the cable industry by one of several strategies: spinning off Liberty, selling cable subscribers or selling the 25.5 percent stake in Time Warner Entertainment that it acquired with the purchase of MediaOne.</p>
        <p>For AT&amp;T, the problem has been that striking a deal with Time Warner is difficult because as Scott Cleland, an analyst at the Precursor Group, an independent research group in Washington put it: ''Time Warner does not want to swap $12 billion of an AT&amp;T passive investment in Time Warner Entertainment for debt.'' AT&amp;T also does not want to sell cable subscribers.</p>
        <p>As a result, AT&amp;T is spinning off Liberty, a move generally considered valuable for Liberty but far less appealing for AT&amp;T, analysts said yesterday. ''This benefits Liberty far more than it benefits AT&amp;T,'' Mr. Cleland said. ''But AT&amp;T painted itself into a corner when they bought MediaOne. No one forced them to buy it.''</p>
        <p>But AT&amp;T and Liberty will still have to receive a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the spinoff is tax free. Otherwise, the government would treat the spinoff as if AT&amp;T sold all of Liberty's assets, leading to hefty capital gains taxes for AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>The tax code prohibits certain types of tax-free reorganizations and spinoffs until a company has owned the entity it plans to spin off for at least two years. AT&amp;T bought TCI, the parent of Liberty, in March 1999 and said yesterday that it did not plan the spinoff until at least March 2001.</p>
        <p>If the government decides that AT&amp;T planned to do a spinoff before the two-year period was up, even though it waited to carry it out, the government could decide that AT&amp;T does not qualify for the ruling and therefore treat the spinoff as a sale.</p>
        <p>The deal is beneficial to Mr. Malone for several reasons. For one thing, it appears that Liberty will receive a cash payment from AT&amp;T of about $800 million as part of the spinoff.</p>
        <p>That payment results from $2 billion of net operating losses that TCI had and Liberty was able to use for tax purposes when AT&amp;T bought the company. Under the terms of Liberty's contract with AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T must buy those benefits out for cash.</p>
        <p>The way it works, according to one analyst who insisted on anonymity, is that if Liberty had $2 billion in profits, then it could use those losses to offset the profits. That means it would have no profits for tax purposes. The value of the $2 billion is equal in real dollars to the value of the taxes it did not have to pay. Depending on the tax rate and certain other factors, the cash compensation could be anywhere from $500 million to $800 million, Liberty said yesterday.</p>
        <p>If the government approves the spinoff, it will give Liberty more flexibility to borrow money to make acquisitions. Under the current arrangement beyween the companies, Liberty could have only up to 25 percent of its market value in debt if exceeding that limit caused AT&amp;T's debt ratings to be downgraded. If the spinoff goes through, Liberty will not be limited by those considerations, nor will it be limited in deals by government concerns that Liberty and AT&amp;T are consolidating too much power in a single entity.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T had fought for a reversal of the government limitations imposed on it after the MediaOne purchase. It lost that battle, however, making the Liberty spinoff more likely. But the announcement yesterday still does not address AT&amp;T's goal of paying down its $61.7 billion in debt.</p>
        <p>Eileen Connelly, a spokeswoman for AT&amp;T, reiterated that the company was firmly committed to that goal. Though AT&amp;T has never put a number on the amount of debt it wants to reduce, Standard &amp; Poor's has said that the company could keep its A rating if it lowered its ratio of debt to cash flow to 1.5 by the end of 2001. That would signal that the company must shed about $15 billion in debt.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T has said it will sell nonstrategic assets. Those still include its stake in Time Warner Entertainment, which owns cable systems, Warner Brothers and Home Box Office. But AT&amp;T has very little power at Time Warner Entertainment, so it is unlikely to find a third party interested in its minority stake. Thus it has been going back and forth trying to strike a deal with Time Warner, which is embroiled in a struggle with the government over approval of its proposed merger with America Online.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T said last month that it would split into four separate companies: a consumer business, a wireless group, a cable operation and a business-services company. That split would occur over time with wireless and consumer units set for spinoff next year and the cable operation in 2002.</p>
