        <p>As the city's five-year contract with the United Federation of Teachers ran out yesterday, the Giuliani administration told the union that it would soon make its first proposal for a new contract.</p>
        <p>The union, which represents 78,000 New York City public-school teachers, has called a rally at City Hall this afternoon to protest what it called Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's foot-dragging in contract negotiations. Union leaders have complained for weeks that City Hall officials have declined to negotiate with them since the two sides held an initial bargaining session in early September.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani and Randi Weingarten, the union's president, continued to attack each other yesterday even though James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, has scheduled a new negotiating session with the union on Nov. 29.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani threatened on Tuesday to put Ms. Weingarten in jail if her union went on strike. Ms. Weingarten said the union did not have any plans to strike, although she added that she had not ruled out any option. Teacher strikes are banned under New York State law.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten accused the mayor of seeking to score debating points instead of pushing vigorously for a contract, which she says is badly needed to raise salaries and help attract more teachers.</p>
        <p>''Instead of negotiating, he threatened me with jail,'' Ms. Weingarten said in a telephone interview. ''It shouldn't take a rally of thousands of teachers after the expiration of a contract for any employee to put its demands on the table.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten had a provocative suggestion of her own yesterday, saying that the teachers' union planned to lobby the State Legislature to reduce the penalties in the Taylor Law, which bars strikes by government employees. She said that law should be changed so that when the city or another government body refused to negotiate in good faith, a union's leaders and members would face reduced penalties if they went on strike.</p>
        <p>At a news briefing yesterday, Mr. Giuliani said city officials were ready to negotiate with the teachers' union, but he added that he would not sign a collective bargaining agreement that put the city's finances in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>''I am more than willing to continue to negotiate with them,'' he said. ''I am not willing to give the city away, or put the city in a situation of fiscal irresponsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani did not look charitably at the union's call for raises of at least 20 percent in a two-year contract to enable its members to catch up with higher salaries in the suburbs. Salaries for the city's public-school teachers range from $31,900 to $70,000, while in many suburbs the top salary is $90,000 or more.</p>
        <p>''In exchange for a generous raise, they are going to have to make a lot of changes in the way in which the whole system works, because the system doesn't work,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''The system that is there is hurting the children.''</p>
        <p>Union officials contend that a large raise is in order because of the city's budget surplus and because the teachers' recently expired contract, like that of other municipal employees, included a pay freeze in its first two years. The last three years of that five-year contract provided for a 13 percent raise.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has repeatedly called for an individualized merit pay system for teachers and other municipal employees. He has called for basing merit pay increases on how well a teacher's students perform on standardized tests compared with the previous year's results.</p>
        <p>But many teachers have denounced that proposal, saying it would divide teachers against one another and discourage cooperation among teachers.</p>
        <p>The mayor suggested yesterday that if teachers were less self-centered, there could be a compromise that produced a settlement.</p>
        <p>''If they make the necessary changes that make it a system that is more about the children than about them, then we could work out the pay issue,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Weingarten said many teachers felt insulted that the mayor and the Board of Education were waiting until the teachers' contract expired before presenting their first set of contract proposals. ''This is no way to do the business of resolving contracts, particularly when you have real problems that have to be resolved, like a teacher shortage,'' she said. ''You should roll up your sleeves and get to the bargaining table.'' Ms. Weingarten said teachers should not let attending the rally prevent them from going to open-school night.</p>
