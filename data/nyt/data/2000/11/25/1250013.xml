        <p>Republicans who control both houses of Florida Legislature harbor long animosity against state's Supreme Court, which time and again has struck down laws they have passed; ill will is exacerbated by fact that all of court's seven justices were named by Democrats who preceded Jeb Bush as governor; Legislatures efforts to pack court or judicial nominating committee so as to move it to the right have died because of protest from bar groups and newspaper editorials (M)</p>

        <p>Early this year, after some stinging losses before the Florida Supreme Court, Republican legislators had a few ideas about how to handle the judiciary.</p>
        <p>Several of them endorsed a plan to pack the court with appointees of Gov. Jeb Bush and tilt it rightward by expanding the numbers of seats on the bench. Many also supported a bill to pack the judicial nominating commissions -- which choose the field of candidates from which a governor can pick a nominee -- by increasing Mr. Bush's appointments to the commission and cutting those of the state bar association. And the Legislature's Republican leaders refused the judiciary's request for new judgeships for overburdened courts, in part to protest the way those judges would be chosen.</p>

        <p>Early this year, after some stinging losses before the Florida Supreme Court, Republican legislators had a few ideas about how to handle the judiciary.</p>
        <p>Several of them endorsed a plan to pack the court with appointees of Gov. Jeb Bush and tilt it rightward by expanding the numbers of seats on the bench. Many also supported a bill to pack the judicial nominating commissions -- which choose the field of candidates from which a governor can pick a nominee -- by increasing Mr. Bush's appointments to the commission and cutting those of the state bar association. And the Legislature's Republican leaders refused the judiciary's request for new judgeships for overburdened courts, in part to protest the way those judges would be chosen.</p>
        <p>The plan to add justices to the Florida Supreme Court and the bid to take control of the nominating commissions both died amid a storm of protest from bar groups and newspaper editorials.</p>
        <p>But they demonstrated the bitterness toward the Supreme Court that Republican lawmakers here felt long before Tuesday, when the court ruled in Vice President Al Gore's favor in the vote-recounting case that could decide the presidency.</p>
        <p>The Republican leaders of the Legislature, eager to humble a court they describe in scathing terms, are promising to find some way to undo that decision. Gov. Jeb Bush -- the brother of Mr. Gore's opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas -- has tried to stay at arm's length from the fray, but legislative leaders say he is very much on their side in seeking to undo the court's decision.</p>
        <p>''The relationship has been very strained, because of the gall, the absolute gall, of those judges,'' said Ginny Brown-Waite, president pro tem of the State Senate. ''Talk about thwarting the will of the voters. Regularly, I hear from constituents, 'How can the court have ruled that way?' I think the court is stuck in the liberal '60's, and hasn't caught up to the fact that the majority of Floridians are conservative.''</p>
        <p>In 1998, Republicans took control of the governor's office and both houses of the Legislature for the first time since the Reconstruction era in the 19th century. But time and again, after they have written their policies into law, the Supreme Court has ruled them unconstitutional.</p>
        <p>The court has struck down Mr. Bush's school-voucher program, one of his proudest achievements; a law that limited death row inmates' appeals; a voter-approved initiative on the death penalty that, among other things, substituted lethal injection for the electric chair; and a law requiring parental notification for girls seeking abortions. To the Republicans, it was like hitting a series of home runs, only to have the umpire take them away.</p>
        <p>''It has very quickly become a very combative relationship,'' said Lance DeHaven Smith, a professor at Florida State University's Institute on Government. ''My sense is that, whether they know it or not, what the Republicans don't like isn't so much the court as the State Constitution, which I think the court has been pretty consistent with. Some of these rulings just blew their minds. They couldn't believe the court would do that to them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith said that the Florida Republicans, much like the Republicans who took control of Congress in the 1994 elections, ran roughshod over their opponents in their eagerness to do everything at once, both because they were trying to make up for years of slights suffered when they were the outsiders, and because they did not know when the opportunity would come again.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court remains on a collision course with the Republicans. The state's term-limits law -- supported by many conservatives -- and a law the Legislature and Mr. Bush approved that strictly limits lawsuit damages are both thought likely to end up before the court.</p>
        <p>''There are members of the Legislature who do not understand the role of the judiciary,'' said Gerald Kogan, a retired chief justice of the State Supreme Court, ''who believe the courts are an agency of the Legislature, and that the courts have no authority to declare anything they do unconstitutional.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans' animosity toward the court is exacerbated by the fact that all seven justices were named by Democratic governors, though one was appointed jointly by Mr. Bush, who was then the governor-elect, and his predecessor, Lawton Chiles, a Democrat.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bush has been quieter about his feelings than many of the legislators, his allies and foes alike say he particularly disliked the late Mr. Chiles, who appointed five of the justices outright, and anyone associated with him. When Mr. Bush made his first run for governor, against Mr. Chiles, then the incumbent, in 1994, he lost in one of the nastiest state campaigns in memory. Mr. Chiles's campaign all but accused Mr. Bush of illegal business dealings and called him a danger to the elderly's government benefits.</p>
        <p>''Chiles and his crowd acted like they owned this place for a long time, and like we were nobodies,'' said one Republican legislator. ''A lot of people couldn't stand them, but Jeb really can't stand them, and everyone knows that's Chiles's court.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has another reason for hard feelings toward the Supreme Court that the legislators may not share: Last year, the Republican leaders of the Senate sued the governor, saying he overstepped his powers in applying a line-item veto, and the Supreme Court ruled in their favor.</p>
