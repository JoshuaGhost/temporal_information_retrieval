        <p>The line is placed in the mouth of Trudy, the shrewdly nutty bag lady (and ''creative consultant'' to aliens she refers to as ''my space chums'') who is more or less the show's narrator, and in the mouth, of course, of Lily Tomlin, who plays Trudy and every other character -- including herself -- in this one-woman tour de force.

        <p>''In the future, we will still be using the phrase 'History repeats itself.' '' It's a funny enough quip, characteristic of the playwright Jane Wagner and the free-standing observations of the ironies and paradoxes of life on earth that pepper her play ''The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe.''</p>
        <p>The line is placed in the mouth of Trudy, the shrewdly nutty bag lady (and ''creative consultant'' to aliens she refers to as ''my space chums'') who is more or less the show's narrator, and in the mouth, of course, of Lily Tomlin, who plays Trudy and every other character -- including herself -- in this one-woman tour de force. But it is the collective aphorisms of the menagerie that serve to represent Ms. Wagner's appealingly crusty view of the world.</p>
        <p>''I worry that humanity has been 'advanced' to its present level of incompetency because evolution works on the Peter Principle.''</p>
        <p>''One thing I have no worry about is whether God exists. But it has occurred to me that God has Alzheimer's and has forgotten we exist.''</p>
        <p>Wait. Haven't we heard this before? Well, yes, of course. This is a revival, after all. Still, even with its crowd-pleasing star in fine, welcoming form, ''The Search for Signs,'' enormously popular in its first go-round in 1985, gives off an unmistakable whiff of deja vu. The history that is repeating itself on Broadway at the Booth Theater, where the show opened last night with its once-trenchant social commentary virtually unchanged, feels a bit too much like, well, history.</p>
        <p>Let's not be too harsh. Many of Ms. Wagner's witticisms retain their vitality: ''Did you know, in the entire universe, we are the only intelligent life forms thought to have a Miss Universe contest?'' And the narrative shape of the show, which is outwardly fragmented by the tales of the various personae, is held deftly together with subtle (and often amusing) cross-references.</p>
        <p>More important, the characters themselves -- including Chrissy, the feckless young woman who can't hold a job, whom we meet at a gym trying to keep up appearances; Agnus Angst, the teenage punk performance artist; Kate, the affluent socialite with an irksomely trendy haircut; the humane prostitutes, Brandy and Tina; and Lyn, whose coming-of-age-in-the-feminist-era story commandeers most of the second act -- are vivid and shrewdly observed.</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago they were variations on types that would become stereotypes (though truth be told, Trudy has always been a bit of a cutesy, wise-fool cliche); but even now the details of their lives, the idiosyncrasies of their speech, persuade us that they are still with us, still out there struggling to make art of soup, to appropriate the Andy Warhol reference that is one of Ms. Wagner's most prominent metaphors. However, their familiarity undercuts their power.</p>
        <p>''All my life I've always wanted to be somebody, but I see now I should have been more specific'': that's Chrissy. ''I am sick of being the victim of trends I reflect but don't even understand'': that's Kate.</p>
        <p>These are good lines, revealing lines, even realistic ones; you know people who might say them. But don't they ring a bit, well, stale? As if whoever said them would have heard them somewhere? Doesn't the humor remind you of a laugh before it makes you laugh?</p>
        <p>Much of ''The Search for Signs'' has this elusive, echoey quality, which now and then becomes concrete. At one point, Lyn, exhausted from child rearing, accommodating her preoccupied former-hippie husband and working at a public relations firm, complains in a one-liner: ''It's hard to be politically conscious and upwardly mobile at the same time.'' The humor of the line, so dependent on buzz phrases from another era, is pure nostalgia. It's hard to imagine anyone under, say, 30 perceiving it as anything other than a pithy, literal remark.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the particular story of Lyn and her friends, Edie and Marge, is on ground that seems to have evanesced underneath it. Certain elements remain timely -- Lyn's disillusioned romanticism, Marge's personal misfortunes and depression -- because they reflect perennial issues. But set against the backdrop of the 1970's and early 80's, with the characters growing to maturity in direct parallel with the feminist movement, the story no longer has the crisp and bittersweet quality of a societal mirror.</p>
        <p>Quite aside from the references to macrame, sensitivity training and geodesic domes, isn't it well accepted by now that the opportunity for women to ''have it all'' wasn't a panacea for them, nor for relations between the sexes, nor for the family, nor for the economy? The story made me merely impatient, but -- forgive the chauvinism -- if I were a young woman I think I might feel cheated by a show that purported to tell a contemporary female story but stopped before I could recognize my world in it.</p>
        <p>No such reservations apply to Ms. Tomlin, however, who, at 61, lays claim to far more youthful zing than her material. The show, with its range of characters and virtual lack of costumes or props (the lighting, by Ken Billington, is a more palpable presence than any set) is a hugely demanding one, verbally and physically. Each character has her distinctions that require the careful attention of an inner choreographer. (Or his: Ms. Tomlin's mimicry of a man lifting weights is textbook bicep work, down to the breathing.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Tomlin has a remarkable command of individual parts: her fluttery hands, for instance, as she fluffs and brushes Chrissy's hair, or her elastic mouth, as she delivers Trudy's evidentiary reports to her space chums with a moue relocated to the side of her face. And in loose-fitting black attire, Ms. Tomlin accomplishes her protean changes at a coltish gallop. The shifts from Trudy's shuffle -- she keeps her pantyhose rolled down to her ankles -- to Agnus's full body rage to Kate's brisk boredom is sometimes so rapid that it's evident there was more to memorize here than the script.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more impressive are the natural glee with which she embraces her performer's task and her fondness for the audience that allows her to be gleeful. There is text in Ms. Wagner's play to support these qualities: ''The play was soup, the audience art'' is the conclusion drawn by Trudy's space chums, not to mention the playwright. But if Ms. Tomlin were merely meeting the script requirements, the evening would be considerably less buoyant than it is. And that's something it doesn't require a long memory to appreciate.</p>
