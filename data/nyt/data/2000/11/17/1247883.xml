        <p>Susan Sontag won the National Book Award for fiction on Wednesday night for ''In America,'' a postmodern novel about a 19th-century Polish actress's attempt to establish a utopian community in California. The book, published this year by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, was partly inspired by the true story of the Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who came to America in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>The awards were announced at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan, with the comedian Steve Martin, who has just published his first novel, ''Shopgirl'' (Hyperion), as host. ''It's slowly dawning on me that I will not be receiving an award tonight,'' he said.</p>

        <p>Susan Sontag won the National Book Award for fiction on Wednesday night for ''In America,'' a postmodern novel about a 19th-century Polish actress's attempt to establish a utopian community in California. The book, published this year by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, was partly inspired by the true story of the Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who came to America in the 19th century.</p>
        <p>The awards were announced at the Marriott Marquis in Manhattan, with the comedian Steve Martin, who has just published his first novel, ''Shopgirl'' (Hyperion), as host. ''It's slowly dawning on me that I will not be receiving an award tonight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The award for nonfiction went to Nathaniel Philbrick for ''In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex'' (Viking Penguin). It focuses on the true story that inspired Melville's ''Moby-Dick,'' that of a 238-ton Nantucket whaler that was sunk by a sperm whale in the Pacific in 1820. Mr. Philbrick, a sailboat racer, is director of the Egan Institute of Maritime Studies on Nantucket.</p>
        <p>The poetry award went to Lucille Clifton for ''Blessing the Boats: New and Selected Poems, 1988-2000,'' a collection of 19 poems about transformation. The book was published by BOA Editions Ltd., a small, independent press in Rochester. Ms. Clifton lives in Maryland.</p>
        <p>Gloria Whelan won the award in young people's literature for ''Homeless Bird,'' a book set in modern-day India. It tells the story of a 13-year-old girl who is married off, then immediately widowed, and sets out to forge her own identity. Ms. Whelan lives in Mancelona, Mich.</p>
        <p>Each winner receives $10,000 and a crystal sculpture.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sontag's novel ''In America'' has received mixed reviews, but she said, ''I don't read them.'' She has also been criticized for drawing too heavily on historical sources for the book, but she said, ''Every time you write a novel from the past you use sources from the past.'' She had noted the sources in the beginning of the book, she said, but ''these materials are completely transformed.''</p>
        <p>The National Book Foundation, which sponsors the prizes, also gave a medal for distinguished contribution to American letters to the science-fiction writer Ray Bradbury.  ''What you're hearing tonight is not myself, but the ghosts of other writers,'' Mr. Bradbury, the author of ''Fahrenheit 451,'' told the audience. He recalled writing ''The Martian Chronicles'' and thinking about Sherwood Anderson's ''Winesburg, Ohio.'' He remembered thinking, ''Wouldn't it be great to write a novel as good as this but put it on the planet Mars?''</p>
        <p>Working, he said, has been ''a surprise and a delight.'' He cherishes those mornings when he wakes up, his head ''full of metaphors,'' he said, and he jumps out of bed to collect them.</p>
