        <p>Dick Cheney campaigned exclusively in California today, a lavish commitment of time and resources on a state that many pollsters believe is securely in the Democratic camp.

        <p>With only 48 hours left in the presidential race, the Bush campaign's decision to send Mr. Cheney to California, where polls have consistently shown Vice President Al Gore ahead, was extraordinary: Time spent here, after all, was time spent away from closely contested swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>

        <p>Dick Cheney campaigned exclusively in California today, a lavish commitment of time and resources on a state that many pollsters believe is securely in the Democratic camp. Democrats called the move a sophisticated feint, but Republicans said it stemmed from their conviction that they could win the state and its 54 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>With only 48 hours left in the presidential race, the Bush campaign's decision to send Mr. Cheney to California, where polls have consistently shown Vice President Al Gore ahead, was extraordinary: Time spent here, after all, was time spent away from closely contested swing states like Florida, Pennsylvania and Michigan.</p>
        <p>But Republicans insist that the polls have tightened enough to give them hope of a victory in California. They have showered money on television advertisements and have set up large get-out-the-vote operations for Tuesday.</p>
        <p>And as Mr. Cheney entered the homestretch -- actually, he spoke at a rally from a stage set up in the paddock at the Del Mar Fairgrounds and Racetrack -- he taunted the opposition as being forced to defend its base in the closing days.</p>
        <p>''We were in Tennessee just last week,'' the Republican vice-presidential candidate said in this suburb of San Diego. ''Every time we go to Tennessee I notice Al Gore is in Tennessee, or he's just been in Tennessee, or he's going back into Tennessee. He's campaigning there this weekend. I thought that was his home state. Maybe they know something we don't know.''</p>
        <p>Referring to his own home state, Mr. Cheney said: ''We're going to carry Wyoming just fine, I'm not worrying about Wyoming. And of course, with Governor Bush at the top of the ticket, we're going to sweep Texas. But I also am convinced that we are going to carry Tennessee and California.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney, a former defense secretary, campaigned with a colleague from the Persian Gulf war, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell, who offered his own forecast for California. ''There should never have been any doubt that California would be in play,'' General Powell said. ''I knew that California would do the right thing when faced with the right choice, and that's what you're going to do on Tuesday.''</p>
        <p>The two men spent their day outside San Diego -- ''a great military town,'' General Powell noted -- renewing their calls to strengthen the nation's armed forces. Mr. Cheney stuck close to his stump speech calling for lower taxes, a stronger military and privatizing part of Social Security, hardly varying a phrase. The men spoke beneath palm trees to a crowd that was warmed up by a mariachi band that had ''Viva Bush'' bumper stickers on its instruments.</p>
        <p>At a rally for Mr. Cheney here tonight in Pleasanton, in Northern California, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts was shouted down by an angry crowd as he arrived to give the Democratic counterspin to local reporters. ''Go Bush Go!'' the crowd shouted as they surged around him, forcing him to retreat to less partisan territory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cheney planned to stay in the West for the rest of the race. He planned to campaign in Las Vegas on Monday, then head to Washington and Oregon before flying home to Jackson, Wyo., where a rally was being planned for him and where he is registered to vote. Then, on Tuesday morning, he planned to fly to Austin, Tex., to wait for the returns to come in.</p>
