        <p>WITH the New Jersey Turnpike at last wired into the E-ZPass system, the trip through pinelands or vinelands to Grandma's House can now be a seamless voyage starting at the Hudson River. That is, assuming Dobbin is wearing his E-ZPass gizmo.</p>
        <p>If Grandma lives along the New York Turnpike or the Mass Pike, the same transponder will work its magic. But if she lives in Portland, Me., the family is out of luck: the electronic toll-zappers on the Maine Turnpike turn a blind eye to the E-ZPass. And there is a lot of other clashing technology on the roads.</p>
        <p>Neil Schuster, executive director of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association in Washington, compared the situation to the days of the video-format wars. ''We are in the state that things were in when Sony's Betamax was going against VHS,'' he said. ''VHS became the standard, and one format will become standard in toll-collecting. Right now, the market is testing the systems.''</p>
        <p>According to the Electronic Toll and Traffic Management organization, which has a Web site at www.ettm.com, tolls are collected electronically in 19 states and Puerto Rico, by an even larger number of agencies. There are 20 brand names, but the E-ZPass has by far the biggest scope: it is the only system in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware and West Virginia. And it can also be read by the Massachusetts Turnpike's FastLane system. Florida alone has five systems: O-Pass, C Pass, LeeWay, EPass and SunPass. None is compatible with the E-ZPass, and, according to Steve Pustelnyk of the Orlando-Orange County Expressway, they are not all in harmony with each other yet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schuster said that such organizations as the Interagency Group, which consists of 16 transportation agencies in seven Middle Atlantic states -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Massachusetts and West Virginia -- were working on the basics: setting standards and establishing how to share revenue through their compatible systems.</p>
        <p>Rena Barta, manager of technology for the group, said it was ''delighted'' with the results in New Jersey. Any agency may apply to join the group, she said. The Delaware River and Bay Authority, which just joined, signed a contract to equip the Delaware Memorial Bridge just after the Jersey Turnpike came on line Sept. 30, which was soon after the Garden State Parkway tied its last toll gate into the system in mid-September. James E. Salmon of the Delaware agency said that the bridge should be collecting electronically by June 30.</p>
        <p>The ''seamless'' auto trip envisioned by technology advocates comes with a caution for those using coins as well: be alert for lane markers. Start to move to the correct side early; stopping is hazardous. As Mr. Shuster says, ''The most dangerous speed is zero.''</p>
        <p>Transponder Nirvana</p>
        <p>The Maine and Florida systems, both of interest to vacationers from the Northeast, are more advanced than the E-ZPass: the holder of the transponder, a palm-size computerized box, can press a button and find out where the device last recorded a toll, and how much is in the account. Florida charges $25 for the device -- not counting tolls -- and Maine a $15 deposit.</p>
        <p>Dan Parrety, a spokesman for the Maine Turnpike Authority, said that in 1995, when the agency began to consider electronic tolls, its real concern was to drop the use of tickets, which were expensive to administer and caused drivers to stop twice -- once to get the ticket and then to pay.  ''It wasn't clear what kind of transponder would dominate,'' he said. ''We were ahead of a lot of states.'' Maine's Transpass went into use three years ago, about the same time New York State completed installation of E-ZPass on the 556 tollable miles of its turnpike.</p>
        <p>The Maine Transpass is principally used by commuters. Tourists taking the Maine Turnpike 106 miles from York, close to the New Hampshire border, to Augusta, pause to pay three cash tolls, although there are 15 toll gates for drivers entering on local plazas. However, Mr. Parrety said that conversations were continuing and that a unified system was eventually going to come about.</p>
        <p>Florida has been phasing in its Sunpass. Kimberlee Poulton, the director of Florida's Turnpike, said electronic toll-readers are in place from Boynton Beach to Miami, and on the Sawgrass Expressway around Fort Lauderdale. The northern section from Three Lakes and Kissimmee, including Orlando, should be done by year end, she said.</p>
        <p>The toll gates on the central portion, from Lake Worth up to Kissimmee, will have to be converted as a single unit, Ms. Poulton said. Work will start next year. Ms. Poulton said 277,000 Sunpasses were in use --  none, so far as she knew, in the cars of New Yorkers. ''They don't commute,'' she said. But Jorge Figueredo, operations manager for the Orlando-Orange County Expressway, said that his roster showed 300 people with metropolitan New York ZIP  codes held his system's E-Pass.</p>
        <p>Days to Avoid</p>
        <p>Jerry Kraft, a statistician for the New Jersey Turnpike, said that the day before Thanksgiving and the day before July 4 were the road's heaviest days. On Thanksgiving Wednesday last year, he said, the turnpike handled 721,000 vehicles, in contrast with the previous Monday's 614,000. On Thanksgiving Day itself, the figure was 495,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kraft had not begun to draft his forecast for Thanksgiving. He suspects the Wednesday traffic this year will reach 740,000.</p>
        <p>I had a revelation recently about  electronic toll-taking, and even if the statisticians consider Thanksgiving Day a light day, I do not. A year ago, a theoretically simple trip became a nightmare. We picked up my rather fragile aunt in Fairfield County, Connecticut, to drive to a family dinner  near Boston, an interstate trip of two and a half hours: some in toll-free Connecticut, and on to the toll-taking Massachusetts Turnpike. One traffic tangle followed another and we were on the road five and a half hours.</p>
        <p>My aunt, in her 90's, grew angry, and I could only gaze despairingly at the Mass Pike's gaping gateways for FastLane transponders, of which there are 417,000 in use, and the E-ZPasses. I knew Massachusetts had gone fully into the system that June, but having no car in New York, I did not have an E-ZPass to take along.</p>
        <p>The next week, I ordered one. I put the gadget in my purse for taxi trips to La Guardia, but even on a chest in my front hall, it serves as the equivalent of a garlic necklace to ward off holiday traffic vampires.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Bliss of the Massachusetts Turnpike said that despite my experience, things were quiet on Thanksgiving: 346,000 toll transactions, in comparison with 582,000 the day before.</p>
        <p>One vision of the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association is the use of transponders for purchases. A test has begun, in Orange County, Calif., where FasTrak went into use in 1993. Lisa Telles, a spokeswoman for the agency there, said that in April four McDonald's gave cars with FasTrak devices the option to charge their Happy Meals and chicken fajitas to their transponders in the drive-through lane.</p>
