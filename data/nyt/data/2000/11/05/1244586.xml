        <p>These days, investors looking for stock tips are likely to go online, talk to friends or consult their psychics.</p>
        <p>But read a book? By the time any book hits the stores, won't its picks be out of date?</p>
        <p>A book released last week, ''100 Best Stocks You Can Buy, 2001'' (Adams Media), by John Slatter, a financial adviser based in Cleveland, puts that notion to the test. It is the fifth in a series that Mr. Slatter started with his picks for 1997.</p>
        <p>The key to investment success, he said, is to get into the stock market and stay there. He compiles his annual lists by reading the business sections of 10 newspapers every day and consulting reports from Value Line and Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>Most of his picks are well-established, blue-chip companies. ''Internet companies don't interest me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What does he look for? Companies with steady earnings per share and dividend growth that do not pay out too much of their earnings but instead put money into research and development.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slatter finished his latest book in June. Already, the outlook for many of his picks has changed. His list includes AT&amp;T, which announced last week that it was splitting itself into four companies; Eastman Kodak, whose stock is down about 29 percent since mid-August; and Williams-Sonoma, whose price has fallen by more than half, to $22, since mid-September.</p>
        <p>But his picks also include Duke Energy, up 70 percent this year; Varian Medical Systems, a medical equipment supplier, up 83 percent; and American Home Products, which has recovered from its unsuccessful attempt last year to acquire Warner-Lambert to post a 53 percent gain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Slatter said that such abrupt movements were inevitable, but that in most cases, his recommendations were still sound. Following his own advice, he has become a millionaire, he said, although he does not claim to be a stock-picking genius. ''You can't be,'' he said. ''But buying common stock will make you so rich that you can do it blindfolded.''</p>
