        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Chicago News Experiment Is Calling It Quits'' (news article, Oct. 31):</p>
        <p>Your article is disheartening to those many of us in television journalism who had hoped that WBBM-TV's format would be successful and lead the way to a wide adoption of more serious and informative news broadcasts.</p>
        <p>The critics are right that WBBM's program had production flaws that probably contributed to its failure to gain ratings satisfactory to management, but there is a more serious cause for its failure -- one that plays right into the presidential election's concentration on the failure of our educational system.</p>
        <p>Television, in news and entertainment, has suffered a huge dumbing down because that is where the audience is.</p>
        <p>Television, which is primarily a for-profit enterprise, can only realize this objective by appealing to the lowest common denominator.</p>
        <p>If we want better television (and newspapers, magazines and movies), a dumbing down of the media is not going to do it.</p>
        <p>Instead, we had better look to a smartening up of the people. That would produce a more discerning and demanding audience.</p>
