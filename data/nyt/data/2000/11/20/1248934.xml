        <p>ANITA GATES</p>
        <p>EBENEZER SCROOGE  ''A Christmas Carol''  By Charles Dickens (1843)</p>
        <p>Scrooge, an elderly, stone-hearted London financier, is not big on philanthropy in the beginning. Approached for a contribution (''A few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth''), Scrooge responds, ''Why?'' He suggests prisons and workhouses instead. But after a challenging night, during which three spirits show him just what a hideous human being he is, Scrooge, played by Alastair Sim in the 1951 British film version, is a changed man. He has the butcher's prize turkey delivered to the house of his clerk, Bob Cratchit. And apparently -- if we are to believe the epilogue of the 1951 film -- he even pays for Tiny Tim Cratchit's surgery.</p>
        <p>JOHN BERESFORD TIPTON  ''The Millionaire''  CBS (1955-1960)</p>
        <p>We never saw his face, but Tipton was the most generous philanthropist of television's golden age. Every week for five seasons, he gave away a cashier's check for $1 million, tax free, to a deserving stranger. Recipients could never try to uncover the identity of their benefactor and could tell no one but their spouses how they had come into so much money. (This was before a one-bedroom in Manhattan cost $750,000.) Tipton (the voice of Paul Frees) was either a saint or a bored elitist who got his kicks out of seeing how badly most people handle new wealth. But at least he was forward-thinking enough to have a male secretary, Michael Anthony (Marvin Miller), in the 1950's.</p>
        <p>C. MONTGOMERY BURNS  ''The Simpsons''  Fox (1990 to present)</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns, the liver-spotted owner of Springfield's nuclear power plant, is a serious skinflint. But in one episode he writes a check for $200,000 to Springfield Hospital and asks Homer Simpson to deliver it. The hospital people misunderstand, think Homer is the benefactor and name a new wing for him. The gift was Homer's idea: ''How about donating money to charity?'' he suggests to his boss. ''I've seen crazy old coots do that.'' Mr. Burns will give again. In a forthcoming episode, he will present young Bart Simpson with a penny.</p>
        <p>TREVOR McKINNEY  ''Pay It Forward''  Warner Brothers (2000)</p>
        <p>Trevor, 12, is the John Doe of his day. He turns a seventh-grade social studies assignment about changing the world into a national movement. If someone does you a favor, suggests Trevor (Haley Joel Osment), do three favors for strangers and pretty soon the world will be filled with good. Trevor befriends a homeless man, feeding him Cap'n Crunch cereal and letting him sleep in the garage. Six degrees of separation later, a gray-haired lawyer walks up to a reporter whose car has just been totaled and gives him a Jaguar. Maybe that lawyer should be at the top of the list.</p>
        <p>IRENE BULLOCK  AND GODFREY PARKE  ''My Man Godfrey''  Universal Pictures (1936)</p>
        <p>Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) is a Park Avenue girl who has to find a ''forgotten man'' (a homeless person) for a scavenger hunt at a benefit. ''All the money goes to charity,'' she tells him. ''That is, if there's any money left over, but then there never is.'' But that doesn't mean she's insensitive. In fact, she rescues the man, Godfrey Parke (William Powell), from the city dump where he's living, and hires him as the family butler. It turns out Godfrey isn't as needy as he seems. Inspired by Irene, he sponsors a project to give food, shelter and jobs to the poor.</p>
        <p>OLIVER WARBUCKS,  a k a  DADDY WARBUCKS  ''Little Orphan Annie''  Created by Harold Gray (1924)</p>
        <p>As everyone in Depression-era New York knows, he's the richest man in the world, and until Little Orphan Annie melted his profiteering heart, he wasn't that nice a guy. Warbucks decides to take in an orphan at Christmastime for thoroughly uncharitable reasons: to counter ''all the negative press you've been receiving,'' as his secretary reminds him in the 1999 ABC film ''Annie,'' with Victor Garber and Alicia Morton. But this orphan is so lovable that Warbucks decides to keep her. He showers Annie with gorgeous clothes, gifts and a servant-enhanced life on Fifth Avenue.</p>
        <p>ABEL MAGWITCH  ''Great Expectations''  By Charles Dickens (1860)</p>
        <p>Magwitch doesn't look like the benevolent type. An escaped convict in chains, he threatens Pip, the working-class boy who crosses his path in a country churchyard, telling Pip that unless he brings Magwitch food and a file, ''your heart and liver will be tore out.'' But Magwitch (Finlay Currie in David Lean's 1946 film version), who goes on to become a wealthy sheep farmer in Australia, repays Pip's kindness many times over, anonymously sending Pip everything he needs to become a gentleman. Years later, he takes the chance of being arrested by visiting England to see how Pip turned out.</p>
        <p>J. B. BALL  ''Easy Living''  Paramount Pictures (1937)</p>
        <p>From the pen of Preston Sturges comes Ball (Edward Arnold), the country's third-biggest banker. Ball gives away his wife's $58,000 sable coat because he's fed up with her overspending. Actually, he throws the coat away, but it lands on the head of Mary Smith (Jean Arthur), a working-girl passerby. Ball insists that she keep it and buys her a new hat; the milliner starts rumors of a romance. Mary is soon living virtually rent-free in the world's largest hotel suite, but she, too, shares the wealth, inviting in an automat worker (Ray Milland). In the end, everybody is rich, and Ball throws the coat at another deserving young woman.</p>
        <p>LONG JOHN WILLOUGHBY  ''Meet John Doe''  Vitagraph (1941)</p>
        <p>Willoughby (Gary Cooper) is a former minor-league baseball player down on his luck who accepts an unusual job offer. A newspaper columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) hires him to impersonate John Doe, a character she made up who plans to commit suicide to protest social ills. Willoughby plays Doe so well that what was a circulation-building stunt turns into a third political party based on helping others. Unfortunately, he's being used by a mogul with political ambitions and fascist tendencies. Good triumphs in the end. It has to; Frank Capra directed.</p>
        <p>POLICE OFFICER CHARLIE LANG, N.Y.P.D.  ''It Could Happen to You''  TriStar Pictures (1994)</p>
        <p>Charlie (played by Nicolas Cage) is a darned nice guy, and he doesn't change when fortune comes his way. One morning he doesn't have change to tip Yvonne (Bridget Fonda), a struggling coffee shop waitress. So he promises Yvonne that if he wins the lottery he will split the proceeds with her. Sure enough, he wins $4 million and gives Yvonne $2 million, to the great dismay of his self-centered wife, Muriel (Rosie Perez). ''A promise is a promise,'' says Charlie, who gives money to blind men on the street and pledges $10,000 to the policemen's widows' fund. Muriel ends up taking his winnings in a divorce, but New Yorkers send Charlie $600,000 in small bills to support his good Samaritanism. It makes a nice wedding gift for him and Yvonne.</p>
