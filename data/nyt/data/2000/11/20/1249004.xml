        <p>On a verdant farm carved from thick jungle, Leonardo Arevalo raises 7,000 fish, a small herd of cattle and plenty of yucca and corn. Yet, in eight years of farming in this corner of southern Colombia, Mr. Arevalo says with a tired look, none of it has brought him much of a living.</p>
        <p>Then there are the five isolated acres lying far off the main road, where Mr. Arevalo raises the only cash crop to speak of in this region: coca. Harvested every three months, the bright, green leaves are sold for processing into coca paste, the gummy base for cocaine. Coca growing has not made Mr. Arevalo rich, but the earnings have helped feed his family.</p>
        <p>By early December, Mr. Arevalo and thousands of farmers on the rolling hillsides near this tiny farming community will agree in writing to become the first to take part in an ambitious government program that calls for them voluntarily to replace coca plants with legal crops, or risk having their farms destroyed.</p>
        <p>The plan, supported with American funding, is a crucial component in the government's $7.5 billion effort to eradicate coca in this prime coca region and thereby weaken the rebels, who use coca profits to finance their guerrilla war.</p>
        <p>''During a long period of time, the strategy in this battle was based on the idea of fumigation, and now what we want to do, from a strategic viewpoint, is increase the importance of voluntary interdiction,'' said Gonzalo de Francisco, President Andres Pastrana's special adviser on the Putumayo Province, where the program is beginning. ''What we're hoping for is that they will work the land with other crops until they have no more room for coca.''</p>
        <p>Under the plan, eligible farmers -- those with less than eight acres of coca -- would immediately replace their coca with corn, plantains or other subsistence crops. Later they would cultivate hearts of palm, black pepper, fish or medicinal plants for the export market.</p>
        <p>The government, in return, is promising subsidies and technical help and tens of millions of dollars to pave roads so farmers can take their crops to market, and to build plants to process crops for sale worldwide.</p>
        <p>If successful, the program would be repeated across Putumayo and beyond, lessening dependence on the aerial spraying that will still be used to destroy large coca fields.</p>
        <p>Crop-substitution, however, faces an array of difficult challenges in this Vermont-sized province, home, the government says, to about half the nation's 255,000 acres of coca.</p>
        <p>First, government officials do not know how the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the rebel group that has taken control of many roads in Putumayo, will react. The rebels see the program as a strategy aimed at defeating them.</p>
        <p>Then there are the farmers' deep suspicions about the government. In Putumayo, a poor and isolated province of farms and dusty towns carved out of Amazonian jungle, farmers remember how a government agency in 1996 prodded them to give up coca for the spiny palm trees that produce heart of palm.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Arevalo's case, he replaced his coca with 10,000 palm trees. Today, the trees -- palmitos, in Spanish -- are fully grown. A swipe of a machete reveals the soft, white insides, popular in salads at upmarket American and European restaurants. So far, however, not one of Mr. Arevalo's palmitos has made it to market because the processing factory the government promised is only now on the verge of opening.</p>
        <p>''They came and they brainwashed me,'' said Mr. Arevalo, 53. ''I did so much work on that field that in 14 months I was ready to harvest. Then, when we had to cut the palmito, we had nowhere to sell.''</p>
        <p>Eduardo Gamarra, who has extensively studied alternative development programs, said weaning farmers off coca with subsidies was nearly impossible in regions like Putumayo that have poor soil and marketing structure. In Chapare Province in Bolivia, where coca has nearly been wiped out, farmers who were paid to switch to other crops often kept growing coca, Mr. Gamarra said, and outsiders attracted by subsidies started arriving. Success only came after Bolivian army troops forcefully destroyed the coca plants, he said.</p>
        <p>''When you cost in all the money you're going to invest, this is not the most rational market-driven mechanism,'' said Mr. Gamarra, director of the Latin American and Caribbean Center at Florida International University in Miami.</p>
        <p>Colombian and American officials acknowledge the obstacles, but they already cite modest success in eradicating heroin poppies in Colombia through alternative development. In the last year, a $15 million American-backed program run by the United States Agency for International Development has led to the voluntary eradication of 1,500 acres of poppies, out of 20,000 acres nationwide.</p>
        <p>George Wachtenheim, director of A.I.D. in Colombia, said the program could work in Putumayo in large part because the farmers are being presented with a stark choice: replace coca or pay the consequences.</p>
        <p>''The threat of forced eradication has to be just as credible as the offer of assistance,'' said Mr. Wachtenheim, who worked on similar projects in Peru and Bolivia. ''We found that one doesn't work without the other, neither the stick nor the carrot. They really do need to go hand in hand, and that's the approach that the Colombian government has crafted.''</p>
        <p>Colombian officials also insisted that while promises to farmers were not always honored in the past, Colombia now has the money and the commitment to make alternative development work. A.I.D. is pumping in $47 million. The Colombian government has budgeted another $15 million for eradication, road improvements and social programs in Putumayo. And more will be spent next year.</p>
        <p>''There are revenues for this,'' said Eduardo Pizano, President Pastrana's chief of staff. ''Before, this was something that was improvised, and -- depending on budgetary availability -- the programs existed or didn't exist. In this case, the money is here.''</p>
        <p>Getting the message across to farmers, however, has not been easy.</p>
        <p>In the small farming communities across the coca belt of southwest Putumayo, the central government in Bogota has enlisted the help of Mayor Manuel Alzate of Puerto Asis and other town officials who have long been staunchly opposed to fumigation. On a recent three-day swing through rebel-controlled territory, the mayor and his aides talked farmers into signing letters of intent, meaning they are on board, at least in spirit, with the government's plan.</p>
        <p>Standing on a stage outside a school in one community, La Carmelita, Mr. Alzate told several hundred farmers that the government planned to honor its pledge. He also warned that not complying could be disastrous.</p>
        <p>''They won't just fumigate your coca, they will fumigate all your plants,'' the mayor said as the audience, weathered men wearing machetes and straw hats, listened intently. ''They will fumigate your homes. Fumigate your chickens. Coca does nothing but bring fumigation.''</p>
        <p>Many farmers later said they would not touch their coca until the government paid them, a proposal the government rejects. Others said they would not replace their coca until roads are paved and processing plants are built. The farmers, and even local officials like Mr. Alzate, also want the government to give them two years -- not one -- to destroy all the coca.</p>
        <p>''If I pull out those plants, there goes all I have,'' explained Marcos Acosta, 48. ''We have all heard the promises. We have all heard that they would help -- and then nothing.''</p>
        <p>Yet the farmers were also clearly intrigued with the idea of somehow seeing legal crops from Putumayo sold in American and European markets, as the government has proposed. And they grudgingly acknowledged that they had few other options.</p>
        <p>''We will pull them out,'' said Jorge Garcia, who has seven acres of coca. ''But we need to see the government act in good faith. They haven't sent us anything before, just soldiers. That's all we get.''</p>
