        <p>On a clear November day here, the sun glitters off the Mediterranean, dancing among the pine trees and the fuchsia bougainvillea. The village retirees gather to play petanque, a game similar to boccie, along the port.</p>
        <p>And there is plenty of parking because the 100,000 tourists who come here in the summer have all gone home and the village's 5,000 residents are back in charge.</p>
        <p>But these days journalists keep dropping by. The mayor of Le Lavandou, Gil Bernadi, has grabbed headlines all over France. Last month he enacted a law that does not permit dying in Le Lavandou. Just mentioning it brings a smile to the faces of the elderly petanque players. They rather like the idea.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' the mayor admitted with a shrug, ''it is an absurd law. But this is an absurd situation and one must have some humor.''</p>
        <p>The problem is that Le Lavandou's one cemetery is full and the plans to build a new one were rejected in June by a Nice court, which ruled that the project violated a law on seafront construction. The environmental group that took the village to court has proposed another site -- an abandoned quarry in the hills. But Mr. Bernadi rejects this as an insult to the dead and a practical impossibility.</p>
        <p>''These environmentalists have chosen the wrong issue this time,'' Mr. Bernadi said. ''A cemetery? It isn't a housing block or a disco. And we aren't even allowing headstones. People around here are really angry. This is about the way we do things here, our customs.''</p>
        <p>The issue has clearly divided the people of Le Lavandou, drawing lines between the families who have lived and died here for generations and the environmentalists. These are seen as part-time residents from Paris who should mind their own business and who do not understand the local traditions, including the need to have a cemetery in walking distance from the village.</p>
        <p>Tradition here calls for the mourners to walk from the church to the cemetery with the coffin.</p>
        <p>Glitzy as they are in the summer months, many of the small villages along the French Riviera are underneath it all run by a small number of year-round residents whose values and means are a long way from yachts and designer clothes. And their populations are aging, even more rapidly than in the rest of Europe since even those who went away to make a living come back to the sun to retire.</p>
        <p>In Le Lavandou, 30 percent of the residents are over 65. A new cemetery is an issue that can bring out a crowd.</p>
        <p>At the end of October, Mr. Bernadi started a petition on the subject and within a day got more than 150 people to go to sign it at the pink stucco City Hall.</p>
        <p>One signer was Marie-Louise Cavatore, 79, who walks from her house to her husband's grave two or three times a week, just to say hello. There is still a space for her in the plot, so a new cemetery is not directly her own worry. But she signed the petition because of her less fortunate friends.</p>
        <p>''This quarry thing is just terrible,'' she said, watering the six pots of chrysanthemums at the base of the Cavatore headstone. ''Maybe the people from Paris have the cars to go wherever they want. But a lot of us do not.''</p>
        <p>Right now, there are nearly 20 people awaiting a final resting place in Le Lavandou. Some are being temporarily lodged above ground in modern stacks built a few years ago, but rejected as inadequate by almost everyone in the village. A few are staying in other people's plots, which could certainly lead to some awkward situations but has not yet.</p>
        <p>''A friend has her uncle with my mother,'' said Lisselotte Glemee, 88. ''They have been in there quite a while. But they seem to get along. I have not heard an argument yet.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Glemee thinks the mayor's ban on dying is very funny. ''The only problem though is I don't think that everyone is going to listen to him,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But the environmentalists are not amused at what they see as a publicity stunt that makes them look bad. The head and founder of the group, Martine Lafontaine, is offended that she is described as a newcomer. She has spent part of the year in Bormes-les-Mimosas, the village next to Le Lavandou, for 40 years. She says she has 300 members supporting her organization, though she will not say how many are part-time residents of the area.</p>
        <p>She is eager to tick off a list of projects she has managed to stop. For her, the cemetery is just one more development project -- a foot in the door leading to more development nearby where there are protected species of plants and a turtle.</p>
        <p>But she admits that she is not too popular these days. ''We are attacked constantly,'' she said. ''We are presented as people who are blocking a culture. Here if you do not have generations behind you, you cannot express an opinion. They will sell their land to you at a very dear price, but don't tell them anything.''</p>
        <p>The issue is far from resolved. The village is appealing the ruling but this could take three years. In the meantime, about 80 people a year die in Le Lavandou. Only one has passed away since the new law, though he had a plot and so was not a problem, Mr. Bernadi said. (Actually, he confides, there is no punishment for dying.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Bernadi says he may just go ahead and build, though Ms. Lafontaine says she will have the project blocked immediately.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens, Mr. Bernadi seems to be winning points with his constituency. Even the younger people like the decree. And all the hoopla may just help bring in more business.</p>
