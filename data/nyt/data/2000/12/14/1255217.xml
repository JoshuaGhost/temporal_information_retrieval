        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Bloom Is Off the Robe'' (column, Dec. 13), Maureen Dowd gets it right when she portrays the justices of the Supreme Court as subject to ''ambition, partisanship, political debts and revenge.''</p>
        <p>But once we accept that they are only human, one must also assume that the framers of our Constitution meant that through lifetime appointment to this highest judicial body of our land, they intended not only to encourage judicial independence, but also to provide a flywheel of continuity over the course of many executive administrations.</p>
        <p>While the decision on Tuesday to disallow recounts may have been a partisan one, the Supreme Court is in fact fulfilling its political role in our system of government. In the final analysis, we will have an orderly transfer of power, and our democracy is intact.</p>
        <p>EDWARD ROSENFELD  Woodstock, N.Y., Dec. 13, 2000</p>
