        <p>''The Emperor's New Groove'' is a timely reminder that animated films don't have to be grandiose visual circuses with full Broadway scores to entertain.</p>
        <p>Not even the parting of the Red Sea can substitute for a sprightly sense of humor and sharply etched cartoon characters swapping wisecracks and doing pratfalls.</p>
        <p>On the surface, Disney's newest animated film looks and sounds like a poor second cousin to Dreamworks's far more splendiferous (but dreary) ''Road to El Dorado.'' But once it hits its groove, so to speak, the new movie exhibits a cheeky effervescence and spunk that were conspicuously absent in its glittering dud of a predecessor.</p>
        <p>The obvious resemblances between the two begin with their pseudo-ancient settings. Where ''The Road to El Dorado'' evoked a gilded Disneyland version of the Mayan empire, ''The Emperor's New Groove'' paints a much less glamorous Saturday morning cartoon version of the Incas in Peru. Their monarch, Kuzco (David Spade), is a glib, sarcastic, monstrously selfish teenager who thinks nothing of having his subjects thrown out the window should they accidentally interfere with his upbeat ''groove.'' Both movies also involve a struggle for the crown and feature characters trading comic banter as they trek through the jungle.</p>
        <p>As the story begins, Kuzco is a happy little despot who is so self-involved that he fails to notice that his chief adviser, Yzma (Eartha Kitt), an ancient, embittered diva, hates his guts and is scheming for his downfall. Aided by her personal assistant, Kronk (Patrick Warburton), a stupid, muscle-bound oaf, Yzma tries to poison Kuzco, but the deadly potion succeeds only in turning him into a llama, which Kronk throws out of the castle.</p>
        <p>Lost in the jungle, Kuzco teams up with Pacha (John Goodman), a kindly peasant who helps him even though Kuzco once threatened to turn Pacha's mountain village into a private resort and send all the residents packing. The movie turns into a standard fable of initiation and growing up in which Kuzco learns enough about friendship and trust in his llama incarnation to acquire some humanity before his restoration to his old self and imperial rank.</p>
        <p>''The Emperor's New Groove,'' directed by Mark Dindal, shrewdly avoids pompous moralizing in favor of zany high jinks and snide, adolescent jokes, which Mr. Spade delivers with a typically smug twerpiness that suits the role just fine. David Reynolds's screenplay is particularly nasty toward old folks. Yzma is the butt of endless jokes about what a frightful old hag she is.</p>
        <p>When she learns that Kuzco is still alive, she and Kronk go looking for him with murder in their hearts.</p>
        <p>While visiting Pacha's family and claiming to be the emperor's great-aunt, Yzma is secretly mocked by  Pacha's children, who snicker that she looks too old to be merely a great-aunt. She must be a ''great-great-great-great-great-aunt,'' they insist.</p>
        <p>The movie has an abundance of clever acrobatic sight gags and giddy nonsense. During a farcical chase in a roadside restaurant, Kronk turns into a chef dishing out his speciality, spinach puffs, as doors slam open and shut. The final struggle for the magic potion that can transform Kuzco from a llama back into a human is an acrobatic free-for-all in which Kuzco and Yzma (who drinks from the wrong bottle and turns into a cat) compete to pounce on the elusive vial.</p>
        <p>Even the movie's lessons in cooperation have a springy touch. Twice, the squabbling Pacha and Kuzco are forced to save themselves from plunging into an abyss by shimmying back-to-back up opposing rock faces.</p>
        <p>If ''The Emperor's New Groove'' ultimately doesn't amount to much, its brand of mindless fun is easier to like than the morally freighted humor of many more expensive animated films that take their allegorical pretensions far too seriously.</p>
