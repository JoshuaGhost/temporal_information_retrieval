        <p>The Vanguard Group has raised the minimum initial investment in the Vanguard Health Care fund from $10,000 to $25,000, to slow its growth. The fund grew to $17.5 billion at the end of November, from $10.4 billion at the end of 1999, both from new investment and appreciation.</p>
        <p>As a fund gets bigger, trading and choosing investments large enough to have an impact become more difficult. ''The fund's board concluded that taking this proactive measure will protect the interests of existing shareholders,'' said John J. Brennan, Vanguard's chairman.</p>

        <p>As a fund gets bigger, trading and choosing investments large enough to have an impact become more difficult. ''The fund's board concluded that taking this proactive measure will protect the interests of existing shareholders,'' said John J. Brennan, Vanguard's chairman.</p>
        <p>The fund is one of the oldest health sector funds, and the best-performing over the last decade. Over the past 12 months, however, its 54.8 percent return has been about average. The change in the fund's minimum does not affect the ability of current shareholders to invest more.</p>
