      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I am one of the dozen or so Williams College students who have the privilege of learning in the physical presence of Mark Taylor. Feeling the floor vibrate as he leaps around the room is a unique experience that an online class could never perfectly replicate or replace. And it is exactly my belief in the uniqueness of the experience that allows me to view online education as a territory of new possibility, rather than as a threat.</p>
        <p>Global Education Network and companies like it will never replace institutions like Williams, and they aren't trying to. GEN offers a new kind of relationship, a network with enough branches to share the education that I so value with more people. How can anyone who truly values education resist a medium that will allow a greater number of students to participate? It is not a substitution; it is an addition. I am an adamant supporter of any system that would increase the number of people exposed to teachers like Taylor. I can tell you that his classes are an incredible experience. Then again, if GEN pierces those academic walls, you might not have to take my word for it.</p>
