        <p>Wang Shuxian, a former farmer who now drives a Cadillac, built his successful textile company with money from friends and family. As a private businessman, he could never sell shares on the country's state-run stock markets. Now he can, in a change signaling that China's economy is preparing to take a sudden turn.</p>
        <p>Few entrepreneurs in this socialist country have been able to raise money from public investors without government support, as Mr. Wang was the first to do in September. But many more people like him should soon be closer to realizing the same dream. Absent a political U-turn in Beijing, new rules are allowing privately owned companies access to the country's capital markets, which so far have been effectively off limits  for nearly all of them.</p>
        <p>While the government will continue to play a heavy role in the market, that simple reform could ultimately reshape China's economic landscape as radically as Deng Xiaoping's breakup of the country's Maoist communes did in the late 1970's. With easier access to capital, private companies have a chance at becoming the main engine of China's economy for the first time since a brief period earlier this century and otherwise since the Song Dynasty nearly 1,000 years ago.</p>
        <p>The change also has political implications: as China's ranks of private businesses grow in number and wealth, their owners will become an increasingly powerful constituency whose demands the government will not be able to easily ignore.</p>
        <p>''The rule of law and access to finance are the two things that will make China's private companies independent from political power,'' said Andy Xie, an economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>Under the existing system, the government, not the market, decides which companies can sell stock to the public. That system puts the power over which concerns get investment money in the hands of local Communist Party bureaucrats, who are most concerned with helping state enterprises in their province survive. The system also encourages bribery and crams the markets with low-quality state companies that would otherwise never be able to list their shares.</p>
        <p>State-owned companies get almost all the money raised on Chinese markets. Entrepreneurs remain politically isolated and financially hobbled, unable to sell stocks or bonds or get significant bank loans.</p>
        <p>But that should begin to change, as China's securities firms decide which concerns will go public, just as securities firms do in the United States and most other places around the world.</p>
        <p>Like most of China's entrepreneurs, Mr. Wang scraped together seed capital from family and friends when he started out 14 years ago. He bought a small textile factory in northeastern Chengde, an impoverished region once the summer playground of China's emperors, and his $6,000 initial investment has grown into the Chengde Dixian Textile Company, with assets worth $53 million and 10,000 employees. He drives a black Cadillac Brougham between rows of yarn-spinning machines to inspect his huge textile mill.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Wang, with about $31 million raised from the first stock offering, plans to expand production and marketing. (He still owns 43 percent of the company.)</p>
        <p>And he is confident that he represents China's future. ''In less than 10 years private companies will dominate the stock market,'' Mr. Wang said. ''State-owned enterprises are an endangered species.''</p>
        <p>Allowing private companies to compete with the state for capital is part of a sweeping overhaul of China's economy accelerated by the country's effort to join the World Trade Organization early next year. Beijing realizes that much of the country's floundering state sector will not stand up to the global competition that W.T.O. membership is expected to bring.</p>
        <p>Beijing grudgingly accepts that a growing private sector is the country's best chance for saving the economy from foreign domination. Strong private companies are also the quickest solution to the rising unemployment that will come as failing state enterprises throw droves of people out of work.</p>
        <p>The transition will take some time. China's private companies disappeared along with all other private property shortly after the Communist Party came to power in 1949. They did not reappear until Deng initiated his sweeping economic reforms in the late 1970's, and they still account for only a small fraction of the overall economy.</p>
        <p>Now, once a company has found an underwriter and meets the exchange's listing requirements, it will be free to sell its shares.</p>
        <p>''Even private companies will be able to raise capital on the markets,'' said James Liu, executive vice president of the Shanghai Stock Exchange.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liu said the opportunities for private companies will broaden further with the establishment of a Nasdaq-style market in the southern city of Shenzhen as early as next year. This ''second board'' will have looser listing requirements, enabling smaller, younger companies to raise capital.</p>
        <p>China established its stock exchanges a decade ago in an attempt to shift the burden of financing state companies from the country's state banks to the public. It worked in part: about 1,000 companies have listed so far, and the combined market capitalization of the two exchanges, in Shenzhen and Shanghai, is more than $500 billion. That will make the market the third largest in Asia, behind Tokyo and Hong Kong, when China eventually merges its two exchanges as expected in the next few years.</p>
        <p>The poorly regulated market is manipulated by the government and industry insiders, and its movement up or down has little to do with the country's economy or the quality of the listed companies. Long-term investors are rare.</p>
        <p>Still, with roughly 50 million people trading shares -- more than in any other country except the United States -- and with personal bank deposits totaling nearly $800 million, China's markets have the potential to finance a private-sector boom.</p>
        <p>''We wish the market were more for investment instead of speculation,'' said Zhang Zhuying, a retired factory clerk who spends her days staring at a market-tracking computer screen in the room of a Shanghai brokerage house reserved for people with trading accounts worth at least $60,000.</p>
        <p>Companies now compete for the right to list their shares by lobbying the country's provincial governments, which are given quotas by China's stock market regulators limiting how many companies they can approve for listing.</p>
        <p>But that means the money all goes to state-owned companies, and there is often corruption. When the Kangsai Group, a maker of Mao suits, wanted to go public in the mid-1990's, its managers distributed shares to any government official who could possibly make a difference.</p>
        <p>A subsequent government investigation found that Kangsai gave more than 100,000 shares to each official crucial to approval -- 50,000 to those with an indirect role and 1,000 to any official who asked for shares and might have made trouble if turned away.</p>
        <p>Kangsai got its market listing in 1996, selling shares to the public for about $1.33 each. The stock's price quickly surged to $3.61, and dozens of officials became rich selling their shares.</p>
        <p>But Kangsai's outdated business ran into trouble as soon as the company had used up its cash. Today, the company is laboring under huge debt, and the stock is trading around $1.50. Several of the officials involved are in jail.</p>
        <p>The result of such cases is a stock market larded with sluggish, barely profitable state companies, some with managers who have little idea what to do with the money they have raised. In some cases, the money has gone to pay workers' salaries or simply been lent to other cash-short enterprises at exorbitant rates of return.</p>
        <p>Mr. Liu is pushing for the existing stock markets' listing quotas to be used up as soon as possible, so the new rules opening the market to private companies can take effect as soon as possible. ''In nine months, the current quotas will be gone,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Even with the expected changes, the state will have plenty of opportunities to steer the system.</p>
        <p>China's regulators will continue to control the market in many ways. Earlier this month, they arranged the bailout of the Zhengzhou Baiwen Company, an insolvent state-owned department store operator and wholesaler of household appliances, because they feared that if the company went bankrupt it would frighten investors, set off a market rout and ruin the chances of other low-quality state-owned enterprises to sell shares.</p>
        <p>That kind of government manipulation has led to an increasingly dangerous stock market bubble. Despite the low quality of China's listed companies and the poor performance of other Asian markets this year, China's stock market has rocketed higher the last 12 months.</p>
        <p>More dud companies. meanwhile,  will list on the stock market before the quota system expires. Imminent listings include Gansu Jiugang Group Hongxing Iron and Steel, a remote state-owned enterprise in a glutted industry, and Inner Mongolia Lantai Industrial, a salt maker.</p>
        <p>And giving the securities industry the power to decide who has access to capital will not solve all the problems. Securities firms in China are still all state-owned and could be subject to political pressure in picking clients.</p>
        <p>The underwriters will also have the power to price initial offerings well below prevailing market prices, as all new shares are priced now. The artificially low pricing ensures that shares surge in early trading, allowing substandard companies to raise capital by selling shares.</p>
        <p>Nor will corruption disappear. Bribery and cronyism have allowed low-quality companies to issue shares on exchanges in countries in which there is much less government involvement, from Hong Kong to the United States.</p>
        <p>But if underwriters do pick prospective listing candidates on the basis of economics, not politics, China's economic revolution will be under way.</p>
        <p>Already, the quota system has expired in the so-called B-share market, where shares are denominated in foreign currencies and intended for foreign investors. (Because of China's tight exchange control rules, foreigners are not allowed to invest in the much larger A-share market, denominated in Chinese yuan.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Wang was the first private businessman to test the new rules by issuing B shares.</p>
        <p>''It took us about a year, but we didn't have to go through the complicated quota approval process,'' he said recently. ''We went public on the basis of our business, not connections.''</p>
