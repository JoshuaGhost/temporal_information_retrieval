        <p>Helen Anne Feingold, the daughter of Susan Feingold and Dr. Alfred Feingold of Coral Gables, Fla., was married last evening to Noah David Kaplan, a son of Carol Kaplan and Dr. Mark Kaplan of Merrick, N.Y. Rabbi Mitchell Chefitz officiated at the Great House, a catering business in North Miami, Fla.</p>
        <p>The bride, 26, and bridegroom, 27, met at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, from which both graduated and where the bride also received a master's degree in social work.</p>
        <p>The bride is a social worker with the Monroe County Intermediate School District in Michigan. Her father is an anesthesiologist and the former chief of anesthesiology at Cedars Medical Center in Miami. Her mother, who is retired, was the office manager for her husband's practice in Miami.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom is an artist and an owner of Noah's Underground Gallery, an art gallery in Ann Arbor. His parents work at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. His mother is the director of the Peer AIDS Education Program, which focuses on teaching teenagers about preventing the spread of H.I.V., and his father is the director of the Center for AIDS Research and Treatment. Dr. Kaplan is also a professor of clinical medicine at New York University.</p>
        <p>Ms. Feingold and Mr. Kaplan became engaged in October 1999, and soon afterward, they attended a Thanksgiving party at a vacation home Dr. and Mrs. Kaplan had rented in Sag Harbor, N.Y. There, 20 or so of Mr. Kaplan's cousins, aunts, uncles and siblings had gathered. The group improvised a game to test the knowledge Ms. Feingold had accumulated about the Kaplan clan during the six years she and Noah had dated.</p>
        <p>Patterned after ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the game offered the candy bars called 100 Grand as its top prize -- 10 of them. In place of trivia from reference books, the questions revolved around the Kaplans' secrets, stories and idiosyncrasies. (What is the last line of the Kaplan family ''hug song''? The answer: ''Doopa, doopa, doopa!'')</p>
        <p>''She knew more than a lot of family members,'' Mr. Kaplan said proudly of Ms. Feingold, who walked away with the million in candy.</p>
        <p>''Everyone was pretty impressed,'' she admitted. ''And I only had to use one lifeline.''</p>
