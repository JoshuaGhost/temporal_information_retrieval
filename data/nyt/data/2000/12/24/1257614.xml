        <p>THE buckskin ceiling is what some American Indian artists call the invisible barrier that keeps them from rising to the top of their field. Not everyone agrees on its definition, or its origins. Some people even deny that such a barrier  exists. But those Indian artists who claim to have bumped their heads against it blame the buckskin ceiling for keeping them out of major museum and gallery shows, and out of positions of power in the art establishment. For them, the buckskin ceiling is an art-world bias that makes space for traditional beadwork, buckskins and trading-post blankets, and ignores almost everything else.</p>
        <p>''The buckskin ceiling is that beyond which native  people cannot rise in the art world,'' Suzan Shown Harjo said. Ms. Harjo, a Cheyenne and Muscogee Indian, is president of the Morning Star Institute, an American Indian legislative group based in Washington. She spoke at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in New York during a recent Atlatl Native Arts Network conference. Atlatl, which takes its name from the Aztec word for a wooden device used to catapult spears in battle, is a national service organization for Indian artists. The Atlatl conference ran parallel to ''Who Stole the Tee Pee?,'' an exhibition at the museum through Jan. 21.</p>

        <p>THE buckskin ceiling is what some American Indian artists call the invisible barrier that keeps them from rising to the top of their field. Not everyone agrees on its definition, or its origins. Some people even deny that such a barrier  exists. But those Indian artists who claim to have bumped their heads against it blame the buckskin ceiling for keeping them out of major museum and gallery shows, and out of positions of power in the art establishment. For them, the buckskin ceiling is an art-world bias that makes space for traditional beadwork, buckskins and trading-post blankets, and ignores almost everything else.</p>
        <p>''The buckskin ceiling is that beyond which native  people cannot rise in the art world,'' Suzan Shown Harjo said. Ms. Harjo, a Cheyenne and Muscogee Indian, is president of the Morning Star Institute, an American Indian legislative group based in Washington. She spoke at the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian in New York during a recent Atlatl Native Arts Network conference. Atlatl, which takes its name from the Aztec word for a wooden device used to catapult spears in battle, is a national service organization for Indian artists. The Atlatl conference ran parallel to ''Who Stole the Tee Pee?,'' an exhibition at the museum through Jan. 21.</p>
        <p>''A lot of museum directors and gallery owners are still stuck in trite images of the past, of Indian fatigue or ennui,'' Ms. Harjo said. ''There is very little room for contemporary images, little room for anything except those stereotypes that are laid on us by people who are not part of our communities.''</p>
        <p>Many American Indians say that a recent history of genocide, resettlement and forced assimilation has left them with a fragmented sense of themselves as a people. Severed from their culture, Indian artists and curators are often divided over what real Indian art was and is. Today, some of the most persistent images in Indian art are not Indian at all.</p>
        <p>''The imagery created in white American art, literature and early film has probably had its most profound impact on our Indian sense of self,'' said Richard Hill, an artist, educator and activist and a member of the Tuscarora tribe who is one of the curators of ''Who Stole the Tee Pee?''</p>
        <p>''Some of our own people began to adopt these cliches and stereotypes,'' Mr. Hill said. ''They get an old picture from 1830 or 1850 and think it's real Indian stuff. This image of the poor Indian on the back of the horse, they both look like they're about to take their last step. Today that image is probably the most popular image in Indian country. You can find it in all the reservations, in beadwork, paintings, quillwork. We took that white man's image, and somehow we adopted it. Partly because we know the consumer will buy it. But partly because a lot of Indians thought the image was true. 'Look what happened to us,' they thought. 'We are at the end of our trail.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill said Indian arts were hampered by a penchant for stereotype, a reflexive tendency to codify both traditional and contemporary forms of expression. Part of this, he said, is a response to the Indian art market, a multimillion-dollar global industry that he says is controlled primarily by non-Indians.</p>
        <p>But part of this habit of cliche also comes from within the Indian community. ''There is, for example, a Southwest contemporary style or school,'' Mr Hill said. ''It began with the introduction of Abstract Expressionism as a legitimate art form for Indians. But it also led to the development of a certain color palette, a certain mode of expression that quickly became standardized. Now many Indian artists believe that this is the authentic Indian art, and the only authentic Indian art. They want to do that, and nothing else. Once again we end up replicating our own past.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Marie Mithlo, an anthropologist and director of the Native American Arts Alliance in Santa Fe, N.M., disagrees. ''If you look at native tribes today,'' she said, ''there is an office for children's services, an office for senior nutrition, an office for housing, education, for land issues. We don't have an office for stereotypes. It's not on the landscape. Of course stereotypes affect us. But native people have ways to deal with that, to take control of our own destiny. If we are still complaining about stereotypes, that means we are a disempowered people. And I just don't buy that.''</p>
        <p>Like many ethnic or minority artists, American Indian artists must negotiate between their own culture and that of the mainstream art world. And it is in that transaction where many Indian artists get stuck. American Indians are usually socialized to think of themselves mainly as members of clans and tribes. Individual affirmation is discouraged. In the contemporary art world, sublimation of ego is not an attribute usually associated with success.</p>
        <p>''I recently participated in a symposium on art and community at New York University, where I was the only Native American,'' said Bob Haozous, an American Indian artist who lives in Santa Fe. Mr. Haozous is best known for politically provocative in situ sculptures, most recently a 16-foot-high steel gate in Santa Fe. The gate is marked with dollar signs, Christian imagery, model airplanes and bullet holes. Razor wire is strung along the top. On the bottom, Mr. Haozous has painted the names of 458 extinct North American Indian tribes.</p>
        <p>''All of the other artists claimed that their community was the art community,'' he said. ''I was the only one who said my community is an actual people.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Haozous, the survival of American Indian art -- and culture -- depends less on adequate gallery or institutional representation than on the ability of his people to define themselves beyond belonging to a certain tribe or territory. ''We can claim bloodlines and land masses, but we don't know the essence that made us different from modern man,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It's not the decorative. It's not the romantic. It's not the historic,'' he added. ''It's how we deal philosophically with this earth. Today we've lost that essence that made us different from modern man. But our intellectual discussions are muted, because we are watching for that Big Brother over our shoulder. We don't want to talk about what we've lost. Our elders don't want to talk about it. And their elders knew better than to talk about it because it meant death. This fear is still within us. So we don't know how to define ourselves as contemporary artists. We'll use New York or world art to tell us what art is. I guess that's the buckskin ceiling right there. But it's ours, not theirs.''</p>
        <p>There are, along with Mr. Haozous, other contemporary Indian artists who have learned to mediate between ethnicity and ego. Bently Spang, an Indian of mixed blood who lives in Billings, Mont., believes he can best serve his people by affirming himself as a contemporary artist. Mr. Spang's ''Modern Warrior Series: War Shirt No. 1,'' on view in ''Who Stole the Tee Pee?,'' is a series of snapshots and film negatives hung from a wooden dummy that reproduces the form of a Cheyenne war shirt. The materials that replace the traditional buckskin sleeves and feather decorations are humble, yet the posture of the piece is proud, almost boastful, like a bird spirit emerging from a faded pile of scraps.</p>
        <p>''When I look back at the artwork and culture of my ancestors, I learn that they were tremendously adaptable people,'' Mr. Spang said. ''They used traditional materials, but also materials of their own time. This shows me how they survived the difficulties of their times and teaches me how to survive as a native person today. I want my great-great-grandchildren to be able to look back at this time period and see how we, as people and artists, learned to survive. That's something useful for them. What are they going to learn from if they only see romantic depictions of the past?''</p>
        <p>If there is a consensus among American Indian artists, it is that work, not discussion, is the only viable response to the buckskin ceiling, and that they, and no one else, must decide what their culture is, and how it should be represented.</p>
        <p>''We've been making art for 50,000 years, and we've only been arguing about it for 50,'' said Mr. Hill, who began his career as an artist before moving into advocacy and education. ''Until recently, we've been apologists for our own culture, trying to say 'Our art is just as good as yours.' Today we're no longer manning the trading post. Some of our art is good. Some of it isn't. But one thing is certain: if we empower people or outsiders to define or evaluate us, we're just a bunch of fools.''</p>
