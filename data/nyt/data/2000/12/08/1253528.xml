        <p>THE annual flood of holiday albums has poured onto record-store shelves. Stars are ready to personalize the old songs or put a wintertime twist on their usual styles; unknowns hope familiar material will help them find new listeners. Pious or raunchy, ethnic or homogenized, blue or sentimental, unabashedly corny or determinedly hip, they all try to pack holiday feelings into cozy commodities. At the same time the holidays also bring out music packages that won't be obsolete on Dec. 26: compilations, greatest-hits albums and reissued albums. Below, the rock and jazz critics of The Times survey the seasonal bounty. (Individual CD's range from $11.97 to $28.97; two-CD sets range from $19.97 to $31.97.)</p>

        <p>''SING CHRISTMAS AND THE TURN OF THE YEAR'' (Alan Lomax Collection/Rounder). Multiculturalism sounded like this in 1957, when the famed folklorist Alan Lomax presented a Yuletide program live on the BBC. Exquisite, quaint and shocking as only living history can be, it includes the contributions of folk singers and storytellers in seven corners of the British Isles. Highlights include the Trinidadian guitarist Fitzroy Coleman extolling the virtues of a Christmas morning rum and an anonymous choir singing the Lord's Prayer in Welsh. The low point is Lomax's recitation of a ''Negro'' spiritual in a voice dangerously reminiscent of blackface. But such jolts only add to the fascination this fragment of yesterday provides.</p>
