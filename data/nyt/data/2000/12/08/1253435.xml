        <p>Judge Nikki Ann Clark of Leon County Circuit Court knows a thing or two about toughness and politics, having witnessed the Detroit race riots and having made her way to the bench after serving as a top aide to Gov. Lawton Chiles. The politically charged case before her now may be the ultimate test of her toughness.</p>
        <p>Appointed to the bench in 1993 by Governor Chiles, a Democrat, Judge Clark is hearing what will no doubt be a defining case in her career, a lawsuit brought by local Democrats who say Seminole County elections officials improperly allowed Republican workers to add missing information to hundreds of absentee ballot applications from Republicans.</p>
        <p>Democrats want all of the county's 15,000 absentee votes thrown out. Republicans say such a move would disenfranchise voters whose ballots are not in question. Judge Clark's decision could determine whether Gov. George W. Bush preserves his  lead over Vice President Al Gore in Florida's presidential election.</p>
        <p>Known for her even-tempered, businesslike manner, Judge Clark, 48, is the first African-American and the first woman named to the Second Judicial Circuit. She is widely considered to have a sharp command of the law and of her courtroom. But Judge Clark, who was unavailable for comment, is also described in legal circles as either a too-liberal political appointee or an independent-thinking  stickler for legal precedent, depending on whether you ask a Republican or a Democrat.</p>
        <p>''She is one of the few members of the bench who comes from a political background instead of coming up through the bar without much prior experience in private practice or as a magistrate,'' said Peter M. Dunbar, a former Republican member of the Florida Legislature. ''It certainly will prepare her for the political spin and swirl around this case.''</p>
        <p>Judge Clark was nominated in September to the First District Court of Appeal, but passed over for the job by Florida's governor, Jeb Bush. The judgeship became an issue in the ballot case when lawyers for the Bush campaign asked Judge Clark to recuse herself, arguing that some people might question her objectivity because of Governor Bush's decision. Judge Clark declined to step aside, saying she was ''not persuaded'' by the defense's argument.</p>
        <p>Some prominent Republicans question the wisdom of that decision.  ''In this world of political visibility, perception does take on shades of  reality,'' Mr. Dunbar said. ''I'm a little surprised that it didn't concern Judge Clark.'' Some local Republican lawyers say they were initially concerned that Judge Clark seemed to land on the bench because of her Democratic political activism.</p>
        <p>''When she first came on the bench there were some misgivings because trial lawyers want trial lawyers on the bench,'' said Richard McFarlain, general counsel for Florida State University and former general counsel to the Republican Party in Tallahassee. But, he added, ''I think she handled the learning curve well.''</p>
        <p>Judge Clark's supporters say she has been unfairly criticized.</p>
        <p>''I think the idea that she is liberal is a racist stereotype,'' said Robert Rivas, a Democratic lawyer who knows Judge Clark and whose wife, Florence Snyder Rivas, also a lawyer, serves with her on the board of the Florida Bar Foundation. Mr. Rivas, who has appeared before the judge, considers her ''judicially conservative.''</p>
        <p>''She works very hard to just apply the law without intentionally being creative, just trying to determine what the precedents are and sticking by them,'' Mr. Rivas said.</p>
        <p>Judge Clark, five feet tall and soft spoken, is regarded as possessing a toughness larger than her stature. The sixth of seven children, she developed survival skills growing up in a Detroit neighborhood that she once likened to a war zone.</p>
        <p>During the Detroit race riots of the 60's, ''I remember tanks driving up and down our streets and alleys,'' Judge Clark said in a 1995 interview with The Tallahassee Democrat. ''From our front porch, we could see black smoke of the city burning down. Within the block, though, there was a feeling of cohesiveness. We were all going to make it through if we'd just help each other.''</p>
        <p>Make it through she did. The daughter of teacher and a rubber factory worker, Judge Clark graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit in 1974 and Florida State University School of Law in 1977. She worked briefly as an assistant state attorney in Miami and as an assistant public defender in West Palm Beach before becoming a lawyer for Legal Services of North Florida.</p>
        <p>For more than a decade until 1991, Judge Clark was an assistant attorney general for the state. She then served as director of legislation and policy development for the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation until Governor Chiles named her director of cabinet affairs in 1993. He appointed her to the circuit court six months later.</p>
        <p>The absentee ballot lawsuit is not her first high-profile case. Five years ago she presided over a trial in which three teenagers were convicted of killing a British tourist.</p>
        <p>In her court biography, Judge Clark says that her work includes ''every kind of case over which the circuit court has jurisdiction.'' The ballot case may be one of a kind.</p>
