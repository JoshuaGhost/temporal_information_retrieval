        <p>The Palestinians failed tonight to muster enough votes in the United Nations Security Council to send an international protection force to the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Israel and the United States have strenuously opposed the proposal, and the American ambassador, Richard C. Holbrooke, said he would veto the resolution if it got the necessary majority of nine votes on the 15-member Council. In the end, an American veto was not needed. The vote on the resolution was eight in favor, with seven abstentions.</p>
        <p>The nations abstaining were the United States, Argentina, Britain, Canada, France, the Netherlands and Russia. The resolution's sponsors -- Bangladesh, Jamaica, Malaysia, Mali, Namibia and Tunisia -- were joined by China and Ukraine. The United States preferred to let the measure be defeated by failing to get the needed number of votes rather than to use the veto that the five permanent members can use to defeat a measure.</p>
        <p>Russia's decision to abstain and not to back the Palestinian resolution was regarded as a major factor in the defeat. By abstaining, the Russians also avoided a confrontation with the United States.</p>
        <p>''This is a resolution that will never be adopted,'' Mr. Holbrooke said as he left the Council before the vote, which followed a long afternoon and evening of negotiations, caucuses and huddles in corridors and meeting rooms around the Council chamber. Last-minute efforts were made to tone down the resolution, which had already been revised over several weeks.</p>
        <p>The Palestinians originally wanted an armed protection force of 2,000 soldiers, but the last draft of the resolution called only for an unspecified number of ''military and police observers.'' The resolution asked Secretary General Kofi Annan to consult both sides about how and where the force would function, although Mr. Annan has said that the stationing of international troops was impossible as long as Israel opposed the idea.</p>
        <p>Arab and Palestinian diplomats rejected the suggestion that with peace talks resuming in Washington, even on a modest scale, it would be an inappropriate time to press for a resolution that is anathema to Israel and the United States. Several members of the Council said that this had been a consideration in the vote. Ambassador Jean-David Levitte of France said the timing had prevented him from voting for the measure. The Netherlands and Argentina expressed similar views.</p>
        <p>Nasser al-Kidwa, the leader of the Palestinian observer mission at the United Nations, said there was no relationship between events in Washington and the effort to create a protection force in the occupied territories. He said  the vote had been delayed long enough. The Palestinians had hoped to finally have a vote last Friday, only to see it postponed again.</p>
