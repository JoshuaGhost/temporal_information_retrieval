        <p>Tenants could be evicted for harassing landlords under revamped New York State housing codes that take effect today. The codes cover about 2.4 million people in rent-regulated apartments in New York City and Nassau, Westchester and Rockland Counties.</p>
        <p>But tenant groups say they will challenge the rules in court, charging that the harassment provision and many other changes are illegal. The revised codes wrongly give owners wider latitude to overcharge, deregulate apartments and evict tenants, the critics said.</p>
        <p>The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal adopted the regulations, saying it was updating and consolidating various legislative amendments, court rulings and policy directives since the last recodification, in 1987.</p>
        <p>''The code continues to provide strong protection for current tenants and their families,'' said the state housing commissioner, Joseph B. Lynch, ''including limitations on rent increases, provision of required services, renewal leases and now even stronger antiharassment penalties.''</p>
        <p>State officials dispute the interpretations of the tenant groups and say they are prepared to defend the codes in court.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the city's largest apartment landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association, said they had not seen the final codes but generally supported an earlier draft as long overdue. The group's president, Joseph Strasburg, said: ''Overwhelmingly, 90 percent of it is codifying existing case law, statutes and operational bulletins. These things have been in effect for years. It's a little late to be complaining about them now.''</p>
        <p>Tenant advocates, pro-tenant lawyers and legal groups that represent the poor met yesterday to plan their lawsuit. ''For one change out of hundreds that might benefit tenants, dozens and dozens favor the landlords,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition. ''It's totally one-sided.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKee said, ''One of the worst parts is the gutting of the rent-regulation system,'' adding that the changes would enable landlords to falsify records and charge illegally high rents.</p>
        <p>The new codes let landlords base rent increases on past rents that are not registered with the state, as required every year, said another tenant advocate, Judith Goldiner, a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society.</p>
        <p>Critics say other new provisions let landlords get around rent regulations by improperly declaring apartments vacant, loosening standards for luxury decontrol, and limiting the rent a tenant may charge to roommates. The critics also object that the codes remove the limit of one 20 percent rent increase upon a vacancy in a two-year lease period, permit surcharges for appliances and utilities, list new criteria for determining primary residency in eviction cases and allow concessions made by a tenant in settling litigation with a landlord to be imposed on later tenants.</p>
