      <abstract>
        <p>People of Al-Ribat, Yemen, are proud that Osama bin Laden, America's most wanted terrorism suspect, is descended from residents of their dusty village; bin Laden's father left Al-Ribat in 1931, but distant relatives remain; project to bring piped water into village is gift to ancestral home from wealthy bin Ladens living elsewhere; residents of Al-Ribat see Osama bin Laden as holy warrior, but one Muslim cleric does speak out against bin Laden's intolerant form of Islam, saying it harms Yemen's reputation; photos; map (M)</p>

        <p>Hemmed in by 2,000-foot rock massifs, this village seems, by measure of its beauty and mystery, altogether more like a place to stay than to leave. Yet Al-Ribat's villagers, driven by poverty, have migrated for centuries -- in recent decades, mostly northward, out of Yemen and across the vast desert known as the Empty Quarter that forms a barrier between here and Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>Historically, few places anywhere in the Arabian Peninsula have been less exposed to outside influences, except for the experiences -- rarely liberalizing -- of those who have migrated to Saudi Arabia and returned.</p>
        <p>Al-Ribat, in consequence, remains an archetype of the deeply conservative, devoutly Islamic and, toward outsiders, insistently wary community that typifies much that is unchanging in remoter parts of the Arab world.</p>
        <p>One migrant, in 1931, was a baggage carrier bound for Jiddah, the Saudi Arabian port city that is a gateway to Mecca, Islam's holiest place. His name was Muhammad bin Laden. In time, he and his brothers founded a construction company, now known as the Bin Laden Group, which prospered by building roads and palaces under the patronage of the Saudi royal family, and made the bin Ladens a fortune estimated at billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>But what has drawn attention to Al-Ribat is not Muhammad bin Laden, who died in the 1960's, so much as Osama, the 17th of his 51 children. Osama bin Laden, in recent years, has been America's most wanted terrorism suspect, with a $5 million reward on his head for his alleged role in the August 1998 truck bombings of two American embassies in East Africa that killed more than 200 people, as well as a string of other terrorist attacks.</p>
        <p>In the indictment drawn up by the F.B.I. against 15 men accused in the embassy bombings, Mr. bin Laden is listed first, as leader of ''an international terrorist group,'' Al Qaeda, that has been largely financed out of Mr. bin Laden's inheritance from his father, estimated at about $300 million. Most recently, the F.B.I. has named Mr. bin Laden as a prime suspect in the suicide bombing of the American destroyer Cole, which was attacked in Aden harbor, 350 miles by road southwest of here, on Oct. 12, with the loss of 17 sailors' lives.</p>
        <p>In Al-Ribat, there are no direct connections, at least none that are known, to the attacks mounted by Mr. bin Laden, who has taken sanctuary since 1996 in Afghanistan. He was born in Jiddah, to a Syrian mother, in 1957, and educated through university level, in civil engineering, in Saudi Arabia. But Mr. bin Laden, himself, has frequently cited his Yemeni ties, speaking often of his hope of leaving Afghanistan and seeking sanctuary somewhere in the ''high mountains and deserts'' of Yemen, where, he has said, he could breathe ''fresh air.''</p>
        <p>This, and the restaints Saudi Arabia has placed on any reporters attempting to delve into Osama bin Laden's roots, has made Al-Ribat an obvious destination for anybody seeking to learn more about one of the F.B.I.'s most wanted men. But with at least three hours of driving to the closest strip of paved road, the village is as remote as any in Yemen, and guards its privacy with care -- much like Yemeni authorities who, since the Cole bombing, have insistently discouraged efforts to probe into the domestic links of all suspects in the attack.</p>
        <p>In October, a reporter trying to reach Al-Ribat was halted 50 miles north of the village by agents of Yemen's secret police. Later, they ordered villagers elsewhere in this part of Hadhramaut Province, in eastern Yemen, not to discuss Mr. bin Laden, or the bombing. But by December, with official surveillance of reporters easing, a visit to Al-Ribat became possible.</p>
        <p>When Britain was the ruling colonial power in this region of the Arabian Peninsula, up to 1967, this part of the Hadhramaut region was a remote hinterland, reachable only by donkey or camel. The village lies at the extreme southern end of Wadi Doan, a dried-up river valley bordered by rocky mountains that narrows and deepens until it reaches a cul-de-sac at Al-Ribat.</p>
        <p>Along dusty alleyways that run between mud brick homes, villagers willing to speak of Mr. bin Laden refer affectionately to ''Osama,'' smiling proudly. Ali Ahmed Bagader, a bright-eyed, keen-witted 8-year-old studying at the Bin Laden Madrassah, or Islamic school, met visitors as they pulled up in the dusty square near the village's main mosque. Along with Salim Saeed al-Gerin, a 26-year-old baggage carrier, Ali offered a guided tour of the village's bin Laden sites.</p>
        <p>''A lot of Yemenis love him,'' he said during a pause at the madrassah, which operates in a wing of a home belonging to Abdullah bin Laden, Osama's uncle and one of the three brothers who founded the construction company. Holding a boxed copy of the Koran, Ali said villagers had come to know Osama bin Laden mainly through television, piped into the village via satellite dishes.</p>
        <p>''We love him because he's a mujahid,'' he said, using the Arabic term for a holy warrior. ''We know that he fights for his faith, and for his country, that he has God's protection, and that he lives in Afghanistan.''</p>
        <p>The only remaining member of the bin Laden family living in the village is Khaled al-Omeri, a 30-year-old second cousin of Osama, who runs a small grocery store, having failed to secure a niche in Saudi Arabia as an automobile mechanic. He, his wife and five children share a three-room apartment in a large, ramshackle home that belongs to Abdullah bin Laden, his grandfather.</p>
        <p>The home, with rotting wooden shutters and rain-stained walls, is known among villagers as the bin Laden house, and the dirt track that runs past it, on the edge of the dried-up riverbed running through the village, is called Bin Laden Street. Nearby is a one-room office for the Bin Laden Group, overseeing a project to bring piped water into Al-Ribat; the project is the bin Laden family's gift to their ancestral home.</p>
        <p>But like many villagers, Mr. Al-Omeri judged it wiser to keep his views of Osama bin Laden to himself. ''This is my jihad,'' he said, motioning to his small son, as he sat on a stoop outside his store. As for Mr. bin Laden, he smiled.</p>
        <p>''On that matter, I'd just as soon keep my peace,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Al-Ribat, with a population of about 7,000, is dotted with mosques and lives, still, mainly from porterage -- the trade of Osama bin Laden's father when he left here by donkey 70 years ago. But for nearly 3,000 years, Hadhramaut has been renowned for its extraordinary agglomerations of 10-  and 12-story mud brick skyscrapers, clustered together for defensive purposes behind high mud walls.</p>
        <p>Al-Ribat, typical of such villages, has traditionally combined its porterage business with a specialization in construction -- thus, in all probability, the transition that Muhammed bin Laden made, once established in Saudi Arabia, from porterage to building.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Gerin, the porter who assisted in the visitors' tour, was asked about what made the village the main center of construction in Wadi Doan, he offered an incredulous response that said much about the persistence of all things in this remote hinterland.</p>
        <p>''Why are we builders?'' Mr. Gerin said, leaning on a cane. ''Well, that's the way it is, and always has been, and always will be, until Judgment Day.''</p>
        <p>Along with this steadfastness come heavy doses of faith. Some of this was echoed in the pamphlets stuck to Al-Ribat's walls by an Islamic summer school, with question-and-answer strictures that reflected a deeply conservative attitude. One of these, on Bin Laden Street, posed the question,''Is it all right to shake hands with a foreign woman?'' and offered the answer, ''It is forbidden to shake hands with any women you can marry'' -- meaning any woman outside a man's own home.</p>
        <p>But at least one of the village's Muslim clerics, who doubles as headmaster of the madrassah in the bin Laden house, was willing to speak out against intolerant forms of Islam, including Mr. bin Laden's.</p>
        <p>''What do I think of Osama's 'holy war against Crusaders and Jews?' '' he said. ''Well, I'll tell you: I am against it, because it harms Yemen's reputation more than it harms America. What I say is, if Osama wants to harm Americans, let him do it in America, not here in Yemen. From my point of view, Osama is a Saudi Arabian, not a Yemeni, and he and his beliefs do not belong here.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 1, 2001, Monday  An article and a map yesterday referred inconsistently to the Yemeni ancestral home of Osama bin Laden, the man wanted by the F.B.I. on suspicion of organizing terror attacks against American targets. The Times's preferred rendering of the Arabic name is Al Rubat, not Al-Ribat.</p>
