        <p>THE MERCIFUL WOMEN</p>
        <p>By Federico Andahazi.</p>
        <p>Grove, $22.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1816, Lord Byron rented a Swiss villa along with the Shelleys; Mary Shelley's stepsister, Claire Clairmont; and Byron's physician and secretary, John Polidori. To amuse themselves on stormy afternoons, Byron proposed that they each write a ghost story. The ultimate winner was Mary Shelley, who turned her sketch into ''Frankenstein,'' but in his new novel Federico Andahazi turns this situation into its own Gothic thriller. What if Polidori were approached by a horrible creature, a ''monstrous excrescence'' of flesh that grew alongside twin-sister vampires, that offers to write Polidori's story for him in exchange for certain sexual favors? These sisters live not on blood but on another bodily fluid coyly described as ''white elixir.'' Sex and death lurk everywhere. Yet Andahazi, an Argentine psychiatrist whose first novel was ''The Anatomist,'' doesn't provide much psychological depth for his characters. Nor do lines like ''Polidori sank into a renewed and inconsolable state of anguish'' seem to be the fault of the translation by Alberto Manguel. The effects here are stagy, and the characters move as if jerked by marionette strings.</p>
