        <p>Ever since the media and business magnate Silvio Berlusconi entered politics, television -- particularly the three highly successful private networks he owns -- has been the main battleground of Italian political warfare.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi, who was elected prime minister in 1994 but lost power in less than a year after his center-right coalition collapsed, is running again in elections expected in April. The center-left government is pulling out every stop to try to block him from using his media advantage. But in seeking to paint its opponent as a right-wing tycoon whose assets represent a towering conflict of interest, the government is revealing its own highly proprietary approach to television.</p>
        <p>The latest clamor took place this week, when Mr. Berlusconi appeared on the country's leading political talk show, ''Porta a Porta,'' and unveiled his political platform, using a giant board and markers to illustrate his plans for Italy. The show is broadcast on RAI-Uno, Italy's state-controlled network.The host, Bruno Vespa, had invited the center-left's candidate, Mayor Francesco Rutelli of Rome, to unveil his platform on the program the week before.</p>
        <p>But that seeming show of balance did not appease Vincenzo Vita, the government's communications under secretary, who complained that the host had allowed Mr. Berlusconi to monopolize the microphone and that the show was nothing more than a campaign commercial for Mr. Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vespa retorted that he had cut 12 minutes from Mr. Berlusconi's taped appearance in an effort to conform to Italy's new law on political advertising, which requires broadcasters to give political adversaries equal time.</p>
        <p>The law, passed in February, bans all paid political ads on national TV and requires public broadcasters like RAI to give all parties free television time at certain hours. Private broadcasters, including Mr. Berlusconi's Mediaset, are not required to give free airtime, but if they give time to one party, they must do so to all.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Mr. Berlusconi took umbrage at a government-sponsored public service ad that ran on RAI, insisting that it was a thinly veiled promotional ad for the center-left. It featured Lino Banfi, the star of one of Italy's top-rated television dramas, talks about how the government has helped families, ticking off state payments to new mothers, tax cuts for couples with children, and paternity leave. ''Thank goodness they have made new laws that help families,'' Mr. Banfi said jovially.</p>
        <p>Mr. Berlusconi is quite familiar with the public service ruse. When he was in office, his government used so-called public service ads to promote his political achievements.</p>
        <p>This time, he immediately appealed to the Italian Communications Authority, but the agency ruled that it did not have standing to rule on public service ads. Mr. Berlusconi's Mediaset reluctantly ran the Banfi ad.</p>
