        <p>THE first person to greet customers at the Burger Heaven restaurant on East 53rd Street near Fifth Avenue is Marguerite Eleanor Cyprus, who welcomes people in an old New York way: with a huge but not too long-lasting smile, quick jokes and her eye on the clock. She grew up working in her family's four Burger Heavens, all in Manhattan, and now at 36 she deals out the menus as quickly as a card shark.</p>
        <p>She also appears to live her life at the high-energy pace of lunchtime at Burger Heaven. She speaks and walks quickly, goes to the gym constantly, loves 1970's disco music and never shies away from dessert. ''Food is a huge part of my life,'' she said. ''Most women try and act delicate and petite. Not me.''</p>

        <p>THE first person to greet customers at the Burger Heaven restaurant on East 53rd Street near Fifth Avenue is Marguerite Eleanor Cyprus, who welcomes people in an old New York way: with a huge but not too long-lasting smile, quick jokes and her eye on the clock. She grew up working in her family's four Burger Heavens, all in Manhattan, and now at 36 she deals out the menus as quickly as a card shark.</p>
        <p>She also appears to live her life at the high-energy pace of lunchtime at Burger Heaven. She speaks and walks quickly, goes to the gym constantly, loves 1970's disco music and never shies away from dessert. ''Food is a huge part of my life,'' she said. ''Most women try and act delicate and petite. Not me.''</p>
        <p>In her love life, she was looking for a man, she said, whom she could ''gut-wrench laugh with'' -- and someone with whom she could also share dessert and her love of disco music. She found him in Dr. Emmanuel Robert Loucas, known as Michael, a family friend who is a dermatologist with Advanced Dermatology, a group practice in Roslyn, N.Y. But it took her awhile to recognize it.</p>
        <p>''We met at a barbecue a couple of years ago,'' she said. ''I guess I just wasn't ready then. I kind of blew him off. Then, my brother and I went to the wake for his father. I looked at Michael and I thought, I made a mistake -- he's such a sweet man. But what was I going to do? I couldn't hit on him at his father's wake.''</p>
        <p>Finally, at a wedding last summer, she spotted him again. ''I thought, Oh, man, I'm not letting him go,'' she remembered. ''It was sunny and I had my big, huge sunglasses on, and I kept my eyes on him. At the reception, I just plopped myself down next to him. The entire night, we danced, we laughed. I ate off his plate. He ate off my plate. He doesn't eat dessert, so I just took my fork and like Jacques Cousteau spearing a fish, I ate his dessert.''</p>
        <p>A week later, they went out for their first date, which ended with them dancing to disco music at a crowded party in Greenwich Village. ''We're loud people,'' she said. ''We both work like crazy, but when we're at a party, we're the first ones on the dance floor and the last ones off.''</p>
        <p>It wasn't long before she knew she wanted to marry Dr. Loucas, 36, not only because he made a habit of writing ''I love you'' in lipstick on her mirror, but because he's so self-effacing. ''I believe Michael is a far better human being than I am,'' she said. ''I'm a little cocky. I can be full of myself. He's so humble. He never tells anyone he's a surgical dermatologist, and when people ask what he does, he says, 'Skin.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cyprus said that her dating a dermatologist brought out the uninhibited side of family members, especially those with worrisome moles or sun spots. ''I'd bring him around my house, and people were lifting up their pants, showing their veins, lifting up their skirts,'' she recalled.</p>
        <p>Dr. Loucas proposed last Easter while ''breaking eggs,'' a Greek tradition in which people knock hard-boiled eggs on a table -- if they don't crack, it signifies good luck for the year. But Dr. Loucas gave Ms. Cyprus a trick egg. He hollowed it out with his scalpel, inserted a diamond ring and glued the shell back together as seamlessly as a plastic surgeon.</p>
        <p>''So, I smack it and he gets down on his knee and says, 'Will you marry me?' '' Ms. Cyprus remembered. ''I started crying instantly.'' Ms. Cyprus, who has wanted to start a family for a while, added, ''My word of the year is 'phew!' because my biological clock is definitely ticking.''</p>
        <p>On Nov. 25, they were married in a traditional Greek Orthodox ceremony at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on the Upper East Side, followed by a rollicking reception at the University Club. (The couple's first dance was to Barry White's 70's hit ''Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe.'')</p>
        <p>She and Dr. Loucas are soul mates, the bride said, especially since she runs fattening burger restaurants and he treats patients who want to slim down. ''We'll put his shop above my shop,'' she said.</p>
