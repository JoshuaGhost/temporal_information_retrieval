        <p>Ending several months of speculation in the video game industry, Electronic Arts said it planned to make titles available for the forthcoming Microsoft game console, the xBox. Microsoft hopes the xBox, scheduled for a fall 2001 introduction, will provide competition to the Sony Playstation and other leading consoles, for which Electronic Arts already makes titles. Robbie Bach, chief xBox officer for Microsoft, said that the decision by Electronic Arts, the largest independent game maker, to also support xBox ''raises the profile'' of the game system. Electronic Arts said it would make 10 unspecified titles available within six months after xBox appears. Electronic Arts shares rose $1.94, or 4.9 percent, to $41.69.</p>
