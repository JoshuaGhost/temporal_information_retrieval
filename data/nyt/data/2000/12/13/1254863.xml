        <p>A Queens contractor that illegally underpaid workers on renovations of New York City buildings will pay $1.9 million to more than 100 employees.</p>

        <p>A Queens contractor that illegally underpaid workers on renovations of New York City buildings will pay $1.9 million to more than 100 employees.</p>
        <p>Alan G. Hevesi, the city's comptroller, said an agreement by Classic Electric Inc., of Astoria to pay the wages due plus interest represented the largest amount of back pay ever from a contractor that violated the city's prevailing wage provisions.</p>
        <p>Under the provisions, the comptroller determines the rates contractors must pay their workers on city construction and renovation projects.</p>
        <p>Public officials and labor union leaders have long said that violations of the prevailing wage law in the state are persistent and widespread. They say that those cheated of the pay due under the law are generally nonunion workers and often members of minority groups or recent immigrants.</p>
        <p>The workers in this case will get from $122 to, for one steamfitter,  $130,000, Mr. Hevesi's office said. The amounts were determined on the basis of underpayments in the various trade classifications -- which also included plumbers, sheet-metal workers and laborers -- and the time worked.</p>
        <p>An agreement settling the case was signed by Mr. Hevesi's aides and Classic's president, Arthur N. Batsidis, on Nov. 27.</p>
        <p>It says that ''the failure of Classic to pay prevailing wages and supplements was a willful violation for each of the four contracts'' involved in the case.</p>
        <p>The agreement said that Classic disagreed with amounts that the comptroller's office found were owed to certain workers, but it agreed not to contest those amounts.</p>
        <p>The company also agreed to pay a $172,000 fine, and it was barred from bidding on or receiving any public contracts in the state for five years, said Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for Mr. Hevesi.</p>
        <p>The four contracts in the case involved $30 million worth of renovations on eight buildings in four boroughs, including the Municipal Building in Lower Manhattan and the Municipal Building in downtown Brooklyn.</p>
