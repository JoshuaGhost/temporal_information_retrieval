        <p>The state's education commissioner added 18 New York City schools to a list of failing schools yesterday and announced that three others would be overhauled. For the first time, the additions include five schools that had been taken off the list but are being put back on, largely because of plummeting test scores.</p>
        <p>Richard P. Mills, the commissioner, said that a total of 25 schools statewide were added to the list yesterday, and 17, all in New York City, were removed. The schools that came off the list included two -- Public School 92 in Flatbush, Brooklyn and Public School 38 in East Harlem -- that had been on the list since its inception in 1989. Most schools on the statewide list -- 98 out of 114, or 86 percent -- are in the city.</p>

        <p>The state's education commissioner added 18 New York City schools to a list of failing schools yesterday and announced that three others would be overhauled. For the first time, the additions include five schools that had been taken off the list but are being put back on, largely because of plummeting test scores.</p>
        <p>Richard P. Mills, the commissioner, said that a total of 25 schools statewide were added to the list yesterday, and 17, all in New York City, were removed. The schools that came off the list included two -- Public School 92 in Flatbush, Brooklyn and Public School 38 in East Harlem -- that had been on the list since its inception in 1989. Most schools on the statewide list -- 98 out of 114, or 86 percent -- are in the city.</p>
        <p>Schools are identified as failing based on their standardized test scores and attendance rates. The designation is a stigma, but also has a silver lining. The teachers there will get additional training, smaller class sizes and other supports.</p>
        <p>The three schools that will be reorganized are Junior High School 82 in the Bronx, and Intermediate Schools 111 and 320 in Brooklyn. Up to half their teachers will be transferred, new principals will be brought in and new curriculums will be introduced. The process takes up to two years, state officials said.</p>
        <p>More middle schools were placed on the list this year than ever before, a sign that they are struggling more than elementary and high schools to keep up with the tougher new standards, Mr. Mills said. Eleven of the 25 additions are middle schools, all of them in New York City.</p>
        <p>The state has revamped its standardized tests in recent years, making them more rigorous by conforming them to new graduation standards it imposed. That could explain why several schools that had come off the dreaded list in recent years found themselves back on it yesterday, state officials said. The five schools, all in the Bronx, that returned to the list are William Howard Taft High School, Theodore Roosevelt High School, I.S. 183, P.S. 64 and P.S. 57.</p>
        <p>''We have continually raised the standards and raised the bar,'' said Sheila Evans-Tranumn, associate commissioner of the State Education Department. ''It's harder for a school to stay above the threshold now that expectations are so high.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Evans-Tranumn said she would urge the state and city to increase resources to schools that leave the failing list, to keep them from sliding backward. Such schools would benefit from training for teachers, small class sizes and a requirement that only certified teachers be hired, she said. All those things are mandatory for schools on the failing list, which get more city money than regular schools.</p>
        <p>About half the city schools identified by the state as failing have been put in the ''chancellor's district,'' under which they receive more money and resources and are required to follow a strict curriculum. Ms. Evans-Tranumn said it was important for those schools to stay in the chancellor's district for at least a while after being removed from the state's failing list.</p>
        <p>But Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said the chancellor's district was ''a hospital ward'' and that schools should be returned to their home districts as quickly as possible after going off the state list.</p>
