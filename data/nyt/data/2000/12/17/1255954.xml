        <p>Whether you consider this New Year's Eve the dawn of the millennium or not, Toronto is gearing up for two big public celebrations. First Night Toronto, the family-centered, nonalcoholic cornucopia of entertainment, turns 10 this year and features more fire eaters, face painters, magicians, professional thumb piano players, bands, dance troupes and comedians than ever.</p>
        <p>More merrymaking takes place at Nathan Phillips Square in front of City Hall, where several bands, thousands of lights and what seems like a significant percentage of Torontonians fill the square for the annual countdown to the new year.</p>
        <p>Aside from the cheap loonie (the Canadian dollar coin, currently worth about 65 cents in United States currency), Toronto is a salutary choice for a midwinter holiday. Its cold is exaggerated, particularly in recent years, when temperatures in January have ranged from 18 to 30 degrees. But even when it's frigid, the city is well supplied with subways, streetcars and buses, as well as an underground web of malls that spans more than six miles and passes more than 300 shops and restaurants (ask for the PATH map at City Hall).</p>
        <p>And, just as a Christmas cake (what Americans call fruitcake) is studded with raisins, Toronto is studded with museums large and pocket-size -- perfect for a gray winter day.</p>
        <p>Visitors to Toronto be warned: an infestation of some 300 moose has been stalking Toronto, especially downtown, since the summer. Variously baubled and costumed according to their location, the fiberglass beasts, a variation on the American and Swiss cows, are the brainchild of Mayor Mel Lastman. Almost all children and some adults love them.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>First Night features more than 400 artists at 14 indoor and outdoor sites, although most events take place around Harbourfront Center, at 235 Queens Quay West. The revels begin at 2 p.m, with a $6.50 admission button in United States funds good for everything from Ballet Creole to Ice Quake!, a speedy figure skating show, to prestidigitators, psychics and Moscow Circus veterans. To guarantee a seat at a particular show, however, $1.30 tickets must be bought in advance; call (416) 973-4000. First Night also offers places to hang out with the kids. Children's Village has rides, games and a petting zoo; Imagination Market provides the wherewithal to make masks, headdresses and costumes. There's even Minimidnight, 8:30 to 9:15 p.m., for those too young -- or too sensible -- to stay up until midnight. It ends with confetti fireworks. For more information: (416) 973-3000, www.firstnight.toronto.com.</p>
        <p>For the older and less sensible, there's the New Year's Eve countdown at Nathan Phillips Square at City Hall, 100 Queen Street West, www.city.toronto.on.ca, (416) 395-7350. Depending on the weather, the remains of a score of vast ice sculptures (judged on Dec. 29 at 6:30 p.m.) will also be in attendance. New this year, fireworks will illuminate the still-futuristic, curved twin towers of Viljo Revell's 1965 City Hall. Admission is free.</p>
        <p>''Larry's Party,'' a new musical based on Carol Shields's novel about an ordinary man with a passion for mazes and starring the Tony Award-winning actor Brent Carver, will be presented by the Canadian Stage Jan. 11 to Feb. 3 at the Bluma Appel Theater, 27 Front Street East; (416) 368-3110, www.canstage.com. Tickets are $35 and $50.</p>
        <p>The National Ballet of Canada's winter season, Feb. 10 to 25, includes James Kudelka's revamped ''Swan Lake,'' the premiere of ''The Comforts of Solitude'' by Jean-Pierre Perreault and ''The Dream'' by Frederick Ashton. At 1 Front Street East, www.national.ballet.ca, (416) 345-9595. Tickets from $17 to $62.</p>
        <p>Tafelmusik, Toronto's celebrated Baroque orchestra, presents Handel's Harp Concerto as well as works by Purcell, Locatelli and Vivaldi. The lute player Paul O'Dette conducts, on Jan. 18, 19 and 20 at 8 p.m., and on Jan. 21 at 3:30 p.m. Tafelmusik's home is Trinity-St. Paul's Center, 427 Bloor Street West, www.tafelmusik .org, (416) 964-6337, fax (416) 964-2782. Tickets are $17 or $26.</p>
        <p>At Mackenzie House, 82 Bond Street, (416) 392-6915, or at www .city.toronto.on.ca/culture, you can absorb some Canadian history along with Scottish food and drink. A leader of the 1837 Rebellion, William Lyon Mackenzie lived there after he returned from his 10-year exile in the United States in 1849. Now a museum that contains artifacts of middle-class Victorian life (open daily; tickets cost $3.25), the house will be the site of a Scotch-tasting evening, with a buffet of Scottish finger foods like meat pies, on Jan. 19 from 7 to 9 p.m. Tickets are $26 and guests must register in advance. On Jan. 21, from 12 to 4 p.m., the museum plans a Robbie Burns Day party with food (including haggis), music and dance.</p>
        <p>Until Jan. 7, almost 50 ceramic collaborations by Joan Miro are on display at the Gardiner Museum, 111 Queen's Park, (416) 586-8080, www .gardinermuseum.on.ca. At times satiric and surreal, always graphic, they reveal a relatively unknown side of the Catalan artist. Open daily; general admission $6.50.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>As well as Miro at the Gardiner, Toronto has another modern master visiting this winter. At the Art Gallery of Ontario, 75 works by Matisse -- intimate paintings of odalisques and music-making, sculpture and drawings -- are on loan from the Baltimore Museum of Art until Jan. 14. A permanent resident at the gallery, with more than 900 works, is Henry Moore. Another standout in the permanent collection is Kenneth Thomson's collection of small-scale sculptures from 1100 to 1800 -- tiny contrivances fashioned from ivory, boxwood and precious metals. The gallery is at 317 Dundas Street West; (416) 977-0414, www.ago.net. Closed Mondays; admission to the Matisse is $6.50, otherwise $4 is suggested.</p>
        <p>One of Toronto's secret gems and its newest art museum is tucked away at the University of Toronto. Highlights of its collection are Lucas Cranach's 1538 ''Adam and Eve''; a cache of Byzantine objects, including bronze pieces and icons; and work from some of Canada's most influential painters, the early 20th-century Group of Seven. All works are on display after Jan. 3 (the gallery is closed for the holidays). University of Toronto Art Center, 15 King's College Circle, (416) 978-1838, or www .utoronto.ca/uc. Tuesday through Friday, 12 to 5 p.m., Saturday 12 to 4; free admission.</p>
        <p>The Bata Shoe Museum, 327 Bloor Street West, (416) 979-7799, fax (416) 979-0078, www.batashoemuseum.ca, marches across 4,500 years of footwear. The permanent exhibition, ''All About Shoes,'' is full of diverting information (why we measure things by feet, the status implications of high heels) and examples of arcane and/or exquisite footwear. Other exhibitions cover early Canadian shoes and contemporary athletic shoes. ''Every Step a Lotus,'' the story of Chinese bound feet, opens on Jan. 24. Closed Mondays; admission is $4.</p>
        <p>It's hard to think of a taste that couldn't be sated at the Royal Ontario Museum, 100 Queen's Park, (416) 586-8000, fax (416) 586-5863, or www .rom.on.ca. Whether you want to spend time with recreated bats, Chinese tomb art or 18th-century English furniture, the choice is yours in one of the grandest granny's attics imaginable. Open daily; $12.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>One of Toronto's more surprising makeovers happened last spring at the Hilton, 145 Richmond Street West, M5H 2L2, (416) 869-3456, fax (416) 869-1478, www.hiltontoronto .com, when all 601 bedrooms as well as the public spaces were revamped into a smashing 21st-century hotel. Comfortable rooms are furnished with teardrop-shaped desks, one-armed armchairs and contemporary photographs of Toronto. Some double rooms now start at $142 but will start at $94 from Jan. 10 to Jan. 31.</p>
        <p>The 1,590-room Delta Chelsea, 33 Gerrard Street West, M5G 1Z4, (416) 595-1975, fax (416) 585-4393, or www .deltachelsea.com, is a good bet for families. It offers separate adult and family recreation areas, including two pools and, for no extra charge, a supervised center for children ages 4 to 12. Standard doubles start at $100 this month, $77 in January; each room has a fax machine and a Nintendo system, and is comfortable but decidedly compact.</p>
        <p>Budget: The 209 cheerful double rooms at the Quality Hotel Midtown, 280 Bloor Street West, M5S 1V8, www.choicehotels.ca/cn312, (416) 968-0010, fax (416) 968-7765, are more spacious than at most other budget places. The hotel is near the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Toronto, and extras include free morning coffee, speaker phones in the rooms and passes to a nearby health club. Doubles: $78.</p>
        <p>Near downtown theaters and the Eaton Center mall, the Bond Place Hotel, 65 Dundas Street East, M5B 2G8, (416) 362-6061, fax (416) 360-6406, or www.bondplacehoteltoronto .com, has 287 small but well-furnished rooms that cost $64.</p>
        <p>Luxury: Windsor Arms, 18 St. Thomas Street, M5S 3E7, (416) 971 9666, fax (416) 921-9121, or at www .windsorarmshotel.com, is a Toronto landmark. It reopened last year with 26 suites, 2 rooms, a restaurant, a nightclub, a tearoom, a spa and an even tonier atmosphere than the original. All rooms have Jacuzzi baths, VCR's, stereos and the only butler's closets in town -- for  unobtrusive delivery of newspapers, room service and the like. A double room costs $191; suites start at $275.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Open since May, Tundra -- in the Hilton Hotel, at 145 Richmond Street West, (416) 860-6800 -- is soothing, neutral (dark wood, white linen, brown upholstery) and chic. The decorative use of rocks suggests Japan, but the food makes sophisticated use of local ingredients. Dinner might begin with grilled quail on polenta, move to Ontario pheasant, and end with gingered creme brulee. Two can dine with wine for about $97.</p>
        <p>Not quite a year old, Patriot also does canny things with Canadian ingredients such as Ontario venison and Huron whitefish. The squab terrine looks like a piece of edible stained glass, and the double pork chop with prune-plum compote is succulent cold-weather fare. The restaurant, on the second floor at 131 Bloor Street West, overlooks one of the busiest shopping streets. Dinner for two with Canadian wine will cost about $65; (416) 922-0025.</p>
        <p>Sintra, 588 College Street, (416) 533-1106, is a blue-and-yellow slice of upscale Portuguese eating. The marinated rabbit with migas, a sublime hash of cornbread, sausage, kidney beans and collards, is a typical offering. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine will cost about $52.</p>
        <p>The Gallery Grill, at Hart House at the University of Toronto, (416) 978-2445, open only for lunch on weekdays and for brunch on Sunday, is one of Toronto's nicest places to eat. The atmosphere is collegiate Gothic, with stone fireplace, stained glass and paintings. The menu offers dishes such as Roquefort souffle on endive with thyme-poached pears. Lunch for two with wine: $42.</p>
        <p>One hits with stars and filmgoers at this year's Toronto International Film Festival was Green Mango, (416) 928-0021, a cafeteria-style Thai restaurant at 730 Yonge Street with rock-bottom prices. A heaping plate of ginger chicken, rice and Thai cabbage salad costs less than $4. There's no liquor and it's cash only, but two can dine well for $13.</p>
