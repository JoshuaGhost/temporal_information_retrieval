        <p>The stock market has stumbled and the economy is slowing, but the holiday party is alive and well.</p>
        <p>Vault.com, a Web site about the workplace and careers, reports that 64 percent of employers it surveyed planned to increase or maintain their spending on parties this year, compared with 1999. Xylo, a research firm in Bellevue, Wash., says 52 percent of employees work at companies that hold office holiday parties.</p>
        <p>Far from an excuse to get drunk or rowdy, the office party often has become an extension of work itself. Some consultants even recommend that the party-goers rehearse.</p>
        <p>''You're giving people a chance to see the richness of you as a person,'' beyond the narrow role they see each day, said Frank Carillo, president of the Executive Communications Group in Englewood, N.J., which coaches executives on effective presentations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carillo recommended arriving at the party with a mental list of conversation topics that go beyond work-related matters, speaking crisply and in complete sentences, asking open-ended questions and avoiding discussions about religion or, God help you, politics.</p>
