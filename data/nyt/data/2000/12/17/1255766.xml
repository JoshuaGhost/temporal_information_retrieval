        <p>Let's say it's holiday feast time, and you want to quell the din at the family dinner table. Do you drag a wet finger around the rim of your water glass or your brandy glass? A new acoustics study has the answer.</p>
        <p>The study is not a holiday trifle, says Andy Piacsek, an associate physics professor at Central Washington University. Such investigations may help engineers prevent seemingly solid objects from shaking themselves to bits.</p>
        <p>In 1940, in a famous case history in engineering, the 2,800-foot-long Tacoma Narrows Bridge in Washington State collapsed in winds of only 40 miles per hour. While there are several schools of thought about the cause, one theory is that as the wind blew across the bridge, it began shaking till it reached its ''characteristic resonance frequency,'' the point at which a small force causes a huge reaction. The roadway cracked like a champagne glass at a Wagner opera.</p>
        <p>Since it is, to say the least, prohibitively expensive to collapse bridges, Mr. Piacsek and an undergraduate student, Dennis Hamilton, have chosen a simpler way to learn more about the resonance frequencies of what Mr. Piacsek calls ''funky'' shapes, or amalgams of different forms. They bought 20 kinds of wine and cocktail glasses at yard sales,  aimed a loudspeaker at each and  measured the glass's vibration.</p>
        <p>They predicted that, like tuning forks, the smaller the glass, the higher the frequency. But the comparatively large brandy glass, it turned out, produced the higher, more annoying, screech. Cheers!</p>
