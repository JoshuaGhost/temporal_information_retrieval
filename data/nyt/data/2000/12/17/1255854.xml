        <p>Tiki Barber remembers his second season as a Giant. He remembers every tormented detail.

        <p>Tiki Barber remembers his second season as a Giant. He remembers every tormented detail. Sitting in a Giants Stadium meeting room last week, he could relate every wound -- physical and mental -- in a season that left him wondering if his National Football League career were destined to be brief and unmemorable.</p>
        <p>''There were times I thought that I'd be an average guy who plays four years and never amounts to anything,'' Barber said.</p>
        <p>After a promising rookie year in 1997, in the next season Barber seemed to lose everything there was to his football life -- his starting job, his ability to catch the football, his breakaway speed, his confidence and his health.</p>
        <p>''My right knee was swollen and I hurt my hamstring compensating for it,'' Barber said. ''I took a ton of anti-inflammatory pills but it didn't help. I was taking a pounding because I wasn't fast anymore and couldn't run away from people so my shoulders hurt. If they threw me a pass, I'd be thinking about not dropping it, so naturally I would.</p>
        <p>''I knew there were people in the organization who wanted to run me out of here. They said I didn't have it anymore. I don't blame them. I know the business; we're all investments and if the investment isn't producing a return, you dump him.''</p>
        <p>Barber smiled.</p>
        <p>''That was only two years ago,'' he said. ''Now, I'm having the most fun in my life.''</p>
        <p>In a Giants season of striking change, Barber has been the most consistent, most versatile, most valuable player on the offense. With two games remaining in a regular season that continues tonight in Dallas, Barber is on pace to rush for nearly 1,000 yards and have more than 700 receiving yards. He has also returned 35 punts for 292 yards. With 3 more yards he will surpass David Meggett's team record of 1,807 all-purpose yards in a season. Already, Barber has become the first Giants player since Frank Gifford in 1959 to have more than 500 yards both rushing and receiving.</p>
        <p>Barber is the Giants' most feared offensive weapon, a player defenses must prepare for because he could be anywhere -- the featured running back, as a receiver out of the backfield, even split wide as a receiver.</p>
        <p>Moreover, with the exception of Jason Sehorn, whose popularity and celebrity are unparalleled on the team, Barber has become the face of the Giants in the metropolitan area. With a weekly radio show and a regular weekend appearance on local television -- which follows a four-month off-season gig as a weekday morning sportscaster -- Barber is ubiquitous and accepted. The concession stands at Giants Stadium did not sell Barber's jersey when the season opened. They did after two weeks. Now they are sold out.</p>
        <p>And when the Giants' season ends, Barber, 25, will become a free agent. Re-signing Barber is among the team's chief off-season priorities. But those negotiations will be complicated because it is hard to classify or categorize Barber, and if you attempt to do so, he won't help you. He does not like the exercise.</p>
        <p>For example, from the time Barber was drafted, people said Barber could be another Meggett. From his first day in Giants training camp, Barber rejected the comparison.</p>
        <p>''I'm faster than David Meggett,'' Barber said. ''I can do things he couldn't do. No disrespect to him, but I never have seen myself as a third-down back and kick returner. I've been fighting that label all my life. But that's what people want to say about me, that I'm not going to be big enough, that I'm not going to be a regular contributor, that I'm not going to be a superstar. Basically, that I'm not going to be.''</p>
        <p>Which is precisely what made the realities of his second N.F.L. season so disturbing -- it gave ample evidence to those who had a limited view of his potential. Still, in the off-season that followed, Barber decided that what he had done most wrong was listen to other people.</p>
        <p>''I had gained weight in part because people told me I was too small for the N.F.L.,'' Barber said. ''That was completely wrong. It made me slower and took away my primary asset -- speed and quickness. It probably contributed to my knee problems, too.''</p>
        <p>So between the 1998 and 1999 seasons, Barber started working out harder and longer, with an almost maniacal devotion to his regimen. When he vacationed in France with his wife, Ginny, he called ahead and made sure every spot they visited had a full-service gym. Barber lost 10 pounds, returning to his playing weight at the University of Virginia, which was 197 pounds.</p>
        <p>Team doctors gave him a new, all-natural medicine for his knees and he changed shoes. His problematic right knee stopped hurting. He watched tons of film and wore out the Giants' quarterbacks with requests to practice running pass routes at the team's indoor facility.</p>
        <p>''I worked harder than I ever did in my life and I trusted in the instincts for the game that had made me successful,'' Barber said.</p>
        <p>Everyone associated with the Giants agreed that 1999 brought out a new Tiki Barber. But the Giants had already decided to relegate him to a typecast role: third-down back and punt returner.</p>
        <p>''I had to accept that given what happened the year before,'' said Barber, who set a team record in 1999 for receptions by a back (66) and whose punt-return average (11.5 yards) was among the best in the league. ''It was part of the road back. The important thing is that I was running away from people again.''</p>
        <p>As the 2000 season dawned, the Giants installed a new version of their offense as seen through the eyes of the team's new offensive coordinator, Sean Payton.</p>
        <p>''When Sean brought the playbook out, I thought: 'This is perfect for me,' '' Barber said. ''These are running plays I like to run -- tosses and misdirections. The passing game fit me. I started telling everyone around me that I was going to have a big, awesome year.''</p>
        <p>The Giants also drafted Ron Dayne, who would handle all the pounding, brutal inside runs that did not play to Barber's strength and only served to wear him down.</p>
        <p>''Ron and I complement each other really well,'' Barber said. ''And neither of us have an ego about how we're used.''</p>
        <p>The coaching staff could not be more pleased.</p>
        <p>''I give Tiki all the credit because he did it himself,'' Coach Jim Fassel said. ''And we found the best way to use him.''</p>
        <p>Last week, at the end of a day at Giants Stadium that began for Barber at 7 a.m. with film study, the team's best all-around offensive player sat with his feet on a table reminiscing -- enjoying, in an odd way, recalling his worst days as a Giant.</p>
        <p>''In my second season, I was like a ball rolling down a mountain and there was no way to stop it until it hit the bottom,'' Barber said. ''Only then, when everyone gave up on me, could I start over.''</p>
        <p>This spring, Barber and fullback Greg Comella would travel to the base of the Ramapo Mountains in northern New Jersey. There was a piece of the Appalachian Trail that went straight up the hillside for two miles. They did it over and over, day after day.</p>
        <p>''There are times in games now when I feel tired in the huddle,'' Barber said. ''And I remember running up against that mountain. And I think, 'I've been through worse.' ''</p>
