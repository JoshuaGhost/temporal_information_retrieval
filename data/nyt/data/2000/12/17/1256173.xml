        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Debra Galant's misguided attempt to find humor in spousal homicide  might have been easier to stomach if  not for the fact that it is not the equal opportunity crime she implies. If Ms. Galant had ever spent time in a family violence shelter, she might be more reluctant to chuckle at the thought of one's spouse having murderous intentions. Bureau of Justice statistics indicate that 70 percent of  victims of homicide by an intimate are women.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Debra Galant's misguided attempt to find humor in spousal homicide  might have been easier to stomach if  not for the fact that it is not the equal opportunity crime she implies. If Ms. Galant had ever spent time in a family violence shelter, she might be more reluctant to chuckle at the thought of one's spouse having murderous intentions. Bureau of Justice statistics indicate that 70 percent of  victims of homicide by an intimate are women.</p>
        <p>Domestic homicide is often the culmination of an escalating history of  abuse, and women's chances of being  victims of domestic violence are 10 times greater that those of men.</p>
        <p>While the Bierenbaum case and others Ms. Galant described are bizarre and sensational, domestic violence remains a far too common event, with fatal results for about 1,400 women in the United States each year, many of whom leave children behind. While family violence has been taken more seriously in recent years, it seems clear we still have a long way to go. As long as the violence persists, Ms. Galant will find many New Jersey readers indeed can't take a joke.</p>
