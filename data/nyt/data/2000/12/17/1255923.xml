        <p>Robert W Creamer letter on Patricia Bosworth November 26 review of book I'd Hate Myself in the Morning: A Memoir by Ring Lardner Jr (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Patricia Bosworth's review of Ring Lardner Jr.'s ''I'd Hate Myself in the Morning'' (Nov. 26) says that Lardner's three brothers, James, David and John, all ''died too young to achieve what their talent promised.'' That may be true for James and David, who were quite young when they were killed, but John lived to be nearly 50 and produced a large and admirable body of work. He was a highly praised weekly columnist for Newsweek for many years, beginning before World War II and continuing long after it. His war correspondence for The New Yorker from the Southwest Pacific and from Italy was superb and was later published in book form. His columns and essays on sports and other matters were collected and published in several books.</p>
        <p>Admirers of fine writing about sports consider John Lardner to be at least the equal and possibly the superior of such masters of the craft as Red Smith and W. C. Heinz. If he had lived longer, there is little doubt that he would have produced more excellent work, but what John Lardner achieved was certainly what his vast talent promised.</p>
