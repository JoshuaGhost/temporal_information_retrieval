        <p>LEAD: For the last four weeks, 28 Chilean exiles, including 10 children, have been occupying the local offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as part of a campaign to obtain political asylum in a country other than Brazil.</p>
        <p>For the last four weeks, 28 Chilean exiles, including 10 children, have been occupying the local offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees as part of a campaign to obtain political asylum in a country other than Brazil.</p>
        <p>The exiles say they became vulnerable to reprisals from both the Chilean secret service and the Brazilian police after a Chilean Army colonel who was kidnapped by leftist guerrillas in Santiago, the Chilean capital, was mysteriously released several weeks later in Sao Paulo early in September.</p>
        <p>The exiles, most of whom are former leftist campaigners, decided to take over the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in a residential district of Rio de Janeiro on Dec. 7 to seek the protection of an international organization and to put pressure on the agency for resettlement elsewhere.</p>
        <p>But while the case has served to illustrate the poverty and insecurity in which low-income exiles must often live, it has also drawn attention to the problems frequently faced by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in dealing with political exiles around the world.</p>
        <p>In this case, representatives of the High Commissioner do not in fact believe that the exiles are threatened here and insist that, as a matter of principle, they cannot negotiate under the pressure of an illegal occupation. Demands Called Unreasonable</p>
        <p>But they are also reluctant to call in the Brazilian police to evict the exiles and, having managed to recover their filing cabinets from the occupied buildings late last month, they have now set up temporary quarters in another United Nations office here.</p>
        <p>The specific demand of the exiles is that the High Commissioner for Refugees arrange for them to be taken directly from the occupied building and put on flights to countries they consider to be more secure. Requests have variously been made for asylum in Australia, Canada, Norway and Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>But George Gordon Lennox, regional representative for the United Nations agency, said these demands were ''totally unreasonable'' because asylum and even migration requests often take several months to process. ''We also feel there is no evidence that any of them is likely to have a security problem in Brazil,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The result is a deadlock that is increasingly testing the patience of both sides. The exiles, for example, were only dissuaded from starting a hunger strike on Friday when Mr. Lennox pledged to obtain status reports on the various asylum requests from the foreign embassies involved. But a hunger strike is still provisionally scheduled for later this week.</p>
        <p>Carlos Lizama, a 33-year-old construction foreman and member of Chile's Socialist Party who escaped to Brazil almost two years ago, said he had never felt safe here because of what he described as traditional collusion between Chilean and Brazilian security forces, particularly from 1973 to 1985 when both countries were under military rule. Lack of Support Noted</p>
        <p>But he also expressed disenchantment over the lack of support that he and other exiles have received from Brazilians who themselves sought exile in Chile in the late 1960's and early 1970's. The High Commissioner for Refugees, however, believes that conditions for political exile have improved noticeably since civilian rule returned here in March 1985. ''Brazil used to be considered a transit country for refugees,'' Mr. Lennox said, ''but we've made a lot of progress toward making Brazil a country of first asylum and of permanent residence.''</p>
        <p>He said the United Nations office now does its utmost to persuade refugees to remain in Brazil since work permits were often available here. ''We're not a travel agency, you know,'' he added.</p>
        <p>But the exiles contend that, even with work permits, they cannot find jobs. ''People see from our papers that we're exiles and immediately say they won't hire subversives,'' one longtime exile, Basilio Espinoza, said.</p>
