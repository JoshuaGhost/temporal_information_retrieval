        <p>How weary I am of having the marketing world tell me I am old and worthless (''The Make-Over at Estee Lauder,'' by Lisa Belkin, Nov. 29)! Movies are made for yuppies. Clothes are designed for people in their 20's and early 30's with the figures of nymphs. And now, even Leonard Lauder has decided that the future of his Estee Lauder empire rests primarily with the young.</p>
        <p>As a successful businesswoman in her middle 50's, I am forever amazed at the marketing geniuses who counsel their clients to attract the younger crowd and make no attempt to appeal to those of us in their parents' generation. After all, we are the generation that has finally ''called in the chips.'' We have sold the businesses. We no longer have the expense of children's camp and college. We have the money to travel, buy expensive clothes, eat out as often as we choose and spoil ourselves with expensive cosmetics and perfumes. We are the generation that threatens to live longer and be healthier in our sweat clothes and running shoes. Why on earth doesn't Madison Avenue recognize the value of our dollars and counsel the Estee Lauders of this world not to abandon us?  PHYLLIS KRAEMER  Pacific Palisades, Calif.</p>
