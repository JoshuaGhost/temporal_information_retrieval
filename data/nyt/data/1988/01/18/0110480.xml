        <p>LEAD: If an athlete tests positive for use of a banned substance, and it is his first offense, should he alone bear the responsibility of sanction?</p>
        <p>If an athlete tests positive for use of a banned substance, and it is his first offense, should he alone bear the responsibility of sanction?</p>
        <p>A subcommittee of the General Association of International Sports Federations - an umbrella group made up of the international sports federations - has decided he should not.</p>
        <p>The eight-member group has drafted a new set of regulations that would expose coaches, trainers and other officials involved with the athlete to punishment even stronger than that imposed on the athlete. The regulations would also standardize sanctions among the international sports federations.</p>
        <p>''We strongly believe that repression of the athlete alone is not enough to reduce the problem,'' Francesco Gnecchi-Ruscone, a member of the group and president of the International Archery Federation, said from his office in Milan. ''If officials, at all levels, are taking the problem much too lightly, we really ought to pull up our socks and recognize where the real dangers lie.''</p>
        <p>The proposal includes the recommendation that if an athlete tests positively, and it is a first offense, the international federation of his sport conduct an inquiry to determine the extent of involvement of his trainers, coaches and other officials. Then, with indisputable evidence that a banned substance was used with outside encouragement, the athlete would receive some leniency. The same consideration would not extend to the others involved.</p>
        <p>''Our philosophy is that an athlete may not know what he's doing or he may be under pressure from his federation's authorities or he may be persuaded to do something illegal,'' Gnecchi-Ruscone said. ''There is no such case with an official.</p>
        <p>The proposals also seek to standardize sanctions. Each international federation now creates its own, which means an athlete in one sport may be subject to a short suspension while one in another may face expulsion for life.</p>
        <p>In any case, the regulations would have to be agreed upon by the full organization. They would also have to be accepted by the international federations.</p>
        <p>''The adhesion of the general agreement would be voluntary,'' Gnecchi-Ruscone said. ''I just hope there is enough concern on the matter that it is accepted by a majority.''</p>
        <p>The United States Olympic luge team is getting a $50 donation from an unusual source: David Letterman.</p>
        <p>Last week on his show, ''Late Night,'' he stuffed $10 into a jar for each laugh generated by unusual newspaper items he read aloud. The first three items were amusing enough, and he put three $10 bills into the jar. The next bombed, and he took one out. By the end, the team had a nice little bonus.</p>
        <p>How did Letterman decide on the luge team? He didn't. His staff did. ''It's such an obscure sport,'' said Dave Rygalski, a writers' assistant. ''We picked it out.'' Not that Letterman wouldn't have done the same. Rygalski said that Letterman is quite a sports fan. ''He'll watch anything ESPN puts on,'' Rygalski said. ''If he saw luge, he'd even watch that.''</p>
        <p>The Cuban Olympic committee is considering bowling for the program of events for the 1991 Pan American Games, assuming the games are not taken away from Havana because of Cuba's decision not to participate in the Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.</p>
        <p>Cuba has just two bowling centers, both of which were built before the revolution and are substandard for international competition. Rather than improve them, the Government is planning to build a bowling center as a part of a sports center on property adjacent to the Palace of the Revolution, the seat of government in Havana.</p>
        <p>Because of the trade embargo between the United States and Cuba, the Cubans are looking elsewhere for help in buying and building equipment for the center. In all likelihood, they will get what they need from Venezuela or Panama, both of which are trading partners with Cuba. Their equipment is American-made.</p>
        <p>''They have a lot of used equipment and rebuilt equipment,'' said Roger Tessman, the executive director of the American Bowling Congress and director of the Federation Internationale des Quilleurs, the international federation of bowling.</p>
        <p>On a recent visit to Havana, Tessman met with Cuban sports officials, who showed him their plans for the center. He advised them they would need at least 24 lanes to accommodate a tournament in the Pan American Games.</p>
        <p>Now that the Chicago Bears' season is over, Willie Gault is resuming his attempt to win a spot on the Olympic bobsled team. The wide receiver left last week for Europe, where he will train and compete, and hope to convince coaches he deserves a place on the team.</p>
        <p>''His chances are not fantastic,'' said David Heim, the executive director of the United States Bobsled Federation. ''He's behind all the other guys, so he'll slide every day. He has got to show the coaches that there is a significant difference in his push times.''</p>
        <p>More than likely, Gault would be a pusher, the second or third man on a four-man team. He might make it as the second man on a two-man team. His assets are strength and explosive power in his legs, the same attributes that make him a successful receiver.</p>
        <p>The 12-member team will be named Feb. 2.</p>
        <p>Researchers have determined that the 1994 Winter Olympics in Anchorage would bring $1.5 billion into the local economy. Anchorage is one of six cities bidding for the Games, which will be awarded in September. Sofia, Bulgaria, is regarded as the leading candidate. . . . Greg LeMond, the 1986 Tour de France winner who missed the 1987 cycling season because of injuries resulting from a hunting accident, is planning a comeback, starting with the Ruta del Sol races in Spain Feb. 2-7. . . . The United States Soccer Federation, which is campaigning to win the bid for the 1994 World Cup, is opening an office in Washington today for fund-raising and marketing.</p>
