        <p>Shelly Finkel, a manager involved with the negotiations for a proposed Mike Tyson-Michael Spinks fight on June 24, said late yesterday that the match seemed ''very close.'' Finkel said that Butch Lewis, Spinks's promoter, is seeking a buyout rather than a guaranteed advance.</p>
        <p>The issue of how much money Lewis would receive has been a major stumbling block.</p>
        <p>Rock Newman, a spokesman for Lewis, said last night that Lewis was seeking a lump sum out of fear that Lewis could not get a fair accounting of fight revenues from Don King, who would be the promoter of a Tyson-Spinks bout.</p>
        <p>Last Saturday, Lewis turned down a $10.8 million offer made by Tyson's managers, Bill Cayton and Jim Jacobs. In doing so, he alienated Cayton, who said that he would deal with any authorized representative of Spinks, except Lewis.</p>
