        <p>LEAD: Growing up on Long Island during the Depression was not easy, Kjeld R. Eriksen recalls. When he was young, his father died and his mother, a Dane, had to raise her four American children.</p>
        <p>Growing up on Long Island during the Depression was not easy, Kjeld R. Eriksen recalls. When he was young, his father died and his mother, a Dane, had to raise her four American children.</p>
        <p>The entire family pitched in, working to pay the rent and buy food and clothes, Mr. Eriksen remembers.</p>
        <p>''There were occasions, Thanksgiving and Christmas,'' he wrote, when the Elks in Great Neck ''brought a bushel basket of food - a turkey and all the trimmings - to our door. We did not know we were poor, as many families were in the same boat during the Depression, the lean years. There were many children with fathers, and many of them could not find work.''</p>
        <p>''I thank God for being born in the U.S.A. and for the many people who joined in their hearts to help others in bad times,'' Mr. Eriksen, who now lives in East Killingly, Conn., wrote. He sent $100 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund in honor of his mother, the late Thora E. Eriksen, and his father, Emil.</p>
        <p>Many immigrants and children of immigrants send contributions to the fund out of gratitude for good fortune in this country.</p>
        <p>Paulette Anagnostaras, who arrived here from France in 1941, writes: ''Made good; thank you, U.S.A.'' Her husband, Ted Anagnostaras, who came from Greece as a music student in 1950 and is today a recognized painter, wrote, ''Thank you America; I made it.'' Their daughter, Marie Georgette, added, ''God Bless America.''</p>
        <p>The Anagnostaras family, which lives in Manhattan, sent $25, designated for the Children's Aid Society, with mention of Dr. Michael Carrera and the Program for Teen-Agers. They also sent two sketches by Mr. Anagnostaras: of the Brooklyn Bridge and of a young man carrying a goat.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 20, 1937, the Herz family arrived in New York as refugees from Germany. To commemorate this 50th anniversary, Werner, Marcia and Hannah Herz sent $50 to the fund.</p>
        <p>''Our gift is made in memory of our parents, Alfred and Hedwig Herz, who established the tradition of an annual contribution to the fund in gratitude for the safety and new life we found here,'' they wrote.</p>
        <p>Frank R. Bingham of White Plains sent a check for $123, $75 as his regular contribution and $48 because ''48 years ago I arrived in this great country.''</p>
        <p>''Ever since coming to New York from the then very unfriendly European shores, this country has been good to me and my family; and this city has truly become 'home' to us again.''  Recorded yesterday ... $17,000.00  Previously recorded ... $2,461,975.14  Total ... $2,478,975.14</p>
