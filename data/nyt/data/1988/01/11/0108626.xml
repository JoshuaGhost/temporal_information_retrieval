        <p>LEAD: Environmental concerns and other problems that have defied legislative remedies will be the most pressing issues when the New Jersey Legislature convenes on Tuesday to close the book on its 202d session and open its 203d.</p>
        <p>Environmental concerns and other problems that have defied legislative remedies will be the most pressing issues when the New Jersey Legislature convenes on Tuesday to close the book on its 202d session and open its 203d.</p>
        <p>New Jersey blames New York City's handling of solid waste for at least one major invasion of its bathing beaches - by floating trash last August. New York has agreed to cooperate in trying to prevent any future problems without admitting it had anything to do with the recent ones.</p>
        <p>''Someone said the best thing we could do to protect our beaches is swear out an arrest warrant for Mayor Koch,'' said the Assembly Speaker, Charles L. Hardwick, Republican of Westfield.</p>
        <p>The cross-river fingerpointing is nothing new. Tides carry waterborne debris up on New Jersey's shore, and prevailing westerly winds blow the emissions from millions of New Jersey vehicles and its industrial plants toward New York, occasionally prompting complaints from officials there. Proposal by Governor</p>
        <p>Governor Kean has proposed spending $200 million over the next few years to clean up the ocean environment and will include $50 million in the budget he will deliver to the Legislature in about a month. The money would be used to upgrade sewage treatment plants and storm sewer systems and to help towns clean their streets and ocean-front towns police the beaches.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Hardwick and the State Senate President, John F. Russo, a Toms River Democrat, said bills to combat ocean pollution would be given priority as the session begins. ''I intend to name a select committee on ocean and beach protection to separate what we can and can't do quickly,'' Mr. Hardwick said. ''The things we can do quickly, such as increasing surveillance, educating the public and improving the handling of garbage on barges, we will take up first, and then roll into the long-range items such as sewer and waste water treatment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo identified another environmental problem that he said ''has leapt to the forefront'' in recent weeks and will have to be addressed by the Legislature. ''Dirty water is becoming our No. 1 problem,'' he said. ''Reports of contaminated wells are popping up in every part of the state, and not just private wells, but well fields that are used by large water companies.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the emphasis on environmental cleanup, the 120 legislators chosen in the Nov. 3 election, who will be sworn in at noon Tuesday at the War Memorial Building, will face some perennial problems.  Insurance</p>
        <p>Despite some changes in automobile insurance regulations enacted in 1983, New Jersey continues to have among the highest automobile insurance premiums in the country and a state-operated Joint Understanding Association that provides coverage for motorists who cannot buy insurance on the open market is facing bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kean, a Republican, and the Republican-controlled Assembly are convinced that the way to reduce costs is to curb auto accident lawsuits. Under the state's no-fault law, the medical bills of everyone injured in an accident are paid automatically. The suits are for ''pain and suffering'' and have continued to proliferate despite the automatic payment of medical expenses.</p>
        <p>The Republicans want to amend the law to bar suits except in cases in which an accident victim is killed or suffers permanent injury or disfigurement. The Assembly has passed the bill a number of times, but it has never got through the Democratic-controlled Senate, which is skeptical about cost-saving claims made by proponents.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Russo and Mr. Hardwick said that if no agreement was reached soon on a plan to amend the present system to reduce costs, it might be time to scrap the no-fault system entirely. The Governor said that he would oppose such a step and that he remained convinced that the curb on lawsuits was the answer.  Taxes and Spending</p>
        <p>A state commission on state and local taxes and expenditures is expected to report on its yearlong study in March, and its recommendations are expected to inspire legislation and controversy. Although the Governor has said he would oppose any attempt to raise the state income tax, Bruce G. Coe, the chairman of the study commission, said changes in both the income and state sales taxes would be among the recommendations.</p>
        <p>Besides dealing with the commission proposals, the legislative leaders said they have some changes in mind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hardwick wants to enact legislation for the state to pay the cost of all new programs it mandates for local governments. ''There will be a lot of talk this year about reducing the local property tax burden,'' he said, ''and the best thing we can do is stop enacting new programs and then passing the costs on to the municipalities. If we have to come up with the money every time we pass something, we'll think twice before we do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo said he was thinking of ''dusting off something I proposed in 1974 - an equalized statewide property tax.'' The Senate President said the Governor's opposition to any income tax revision would probably stall any effort to use that tax to offset local property taxes in older urban areas.</p>
        <p>Under the equalized property tax concept, he said, the state would raise the same total in property taxes but the rate would be made the same in every municipality. This would have the effect of lowering the tax in the cities, which now have the highest property tax rates, and shift some of the burden to suburban towns with lower rates. Under the plan, the state tax would replace the local property tax.</p>
        <p>''For example, if we raise $5 billion a year now, we'll still collect $5 billion,'' Mr. Russo said. ''except that Newark won't have a rate of $8 per $100 of assessed valuation and Princeton $2 -they'll each have a rate of, say, $4.'' The rates are not accurate, he said, but illustrate what would occur under a system that equalized rates statewide.  Land Use and Campaigns</p>
        <p>A state commission on land use and planning is putting the finishing touches on its report, and Mr. Hardwick said he wanted to pass a bill to give the Legislature more oversight over the state master plan that would be the end product of the study.</p>
        <p>With Senate and Assembly candidates spending more than $11 million in the last election, Mr. Russo said he would support putting some campaign spending limits on legislative races.</p>
