        <p>LEAD: A teen-ager who resisted a robbery was shot in the thigh, and the same bullet seriously wounded a woman who was seated near him on a subway train in Brooklyn yesterday, the police said.

        <p>A teen-ager who resisted a robbery was shot in the thigh, and the same bullet seriously wounded a woman who was seated near him on a subway train in Brooklyn yesterday, the police said. The gunman escaped.  The victims were shot on a southbound A train as it approached the Kingston-Throop Avenue station in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section about 1 P.M., the police said. They said another teen-ager tried to steal a gold chain from the youth, Phillip DeSilva, 16 years old, and shot him once with a .45-caliber pistol when he resisted.</p>
        <p>The bullet went through Mr. DeSilva's right thigh and struck the woman, Mary Huggins, 47, of 492 Throop Avenue, in the stomach. She was listed in critical condition at Kings County Hospital and was undergoing surgery to remove the bullet, said a hospital spokeswoman, Leah Johnson. Mr. DeSilva was in stable condition at the hospital. Gun Is Recovered</p>
        <p>The suspect ran from the train after it stopped and the doors opened. A transit police officer posted at the station encountered the suspect, who told him there had been a shooting on the train, said a transit police spokesman, Albert W. O'Leary. But the teen-ager fled when the officer, Edward Tamney, tried to obtain more information and detain him as a witness, Mr. O'Leary said.</p>
        <p>Officer Tamney chased the youth onto the street. During the pursuit, the suspect dropped a gun, a United States Army-issue .45-caliber Colt pistol. After picking up the gun, the officer renewed the chase, but lost the suspect in the Albany Houses project at Park Place, Mr. O'Leary said.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Leary said he did not know whether Mr. DeSilva had known the suspect. He said the wounded woman was ''a bystander.''</p>
        <p>The only description that the police could provide of the suspect was that he was black, about 17 years old and was wearing two rings on his left hand and a red ski jacket.</p>
