        <p>LEAD: Prices of Government securities fell sharply yesterday after the release of a better-than-expected report on the nationwide unemployment rate.</p>
        <p>Prices of Government securities fell sharply yesterday after the release of a better-than-expected report on the nationwide unemployment rate.</p>
        <p>Trading in Government securities was light, in a session shortened by about two hours because of the snowstorm enveloping the East Coast.</p>
        <p>The 8 7/8 Treasury issue due in 2017 fell almost two points, to 97 11/32, to yield 9.14 percent.</p>
        <p>A drop in unemployment, reflecting strength in the economy, raises fears of inflation. The credit markets often respond with higher interest rates and falling prices. 115.5 Million Employed The unemployment rate fell to 5.7 percent in December, the Commerce Department said, its lowest level since July 1979. About 235,000 Americans found work in December, raising total employment to 115.5 million and dropping the jobless rate one-tenth of 1 percent from November.</p>
        <p>In the light trading, the sharp drop in prices may have reflected, in part, dealers' decisions not to hold positions over the weekend and to head home early because of the storm.</p>
        <p>Market participants noted that the report allayed any fears of a recession in the near term or of any easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
        <p>''The employment report may not be as strong as it appears,'' said Joseph Plocek, senior vice president at McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc. ''Much of the 326,000-person rise in the payroll may have been part-time workers as reflected in the lower average workweek and lower average earnings. The market may have overreacted on the downside.'' Dollar Declines</p>
        <p>The dollar was down against most major foreign currencies in light trading yesterday, in contrast to sharp advances in heavy trading in this week's first four trading days.</p>
        <p>Theodore Tung, chief economist of the National City Corporation of Cleveland, said that, despite the dollar's strong improvement most of the week, concern remained that it could weaken again if trade figures to be reported next Friday were worse than expected.</p>
        <p>''The dollar appears to be stabilized for the near term at least, and the strong employment expansion is unlikely to continue,'' Mr. Tung said. ''The layoffs announced by Wall Street firms and other financial institutions will slow employment growth over the next several months so there should not be undue pressure on interest rates soon.''</p>
        <p>Rates were higher in the short-term bill market. The outstanding three-month bill was up 9 basis points, to 5.87 percent, while the six-month bill rose 10 basis points, to 6.45 percent.</p>
        <p>The Treasury announced that it planned to auction $9.25 billion of one-year bills next Thursday. By late yesterday, the outstanding one-year bill was up 12 basis points, to 6.75 percent.</p>
