        <p>The mental confusion of hospital patients recovering from surgery should not be surprising; general anesthesia wears off gradually and is known to produce such disorientation, even days afterward (Body and Mind: ''Sick Thinking,'' by Morton Hunt, Jan. 3). More disturbing is the failure of Morton Hunt, and Dr. Eric Cassell, whom he quotes at length, to understand that the patient's loss of intellectual perspective and regression to childlike dependency may be socially produced by a series of events that strip away his identity as an integrated and fully functioning adult.</p>
        <p>Upon admission to a hospital, a patient's clothes are exchanged for a hospital gown designed only to provide doctors with easy access to the body; earrings, watches and even wedding bands must be removed. A patient may not even keep his own prescribed medication. He may be addressed familiarly, by his first name - like a child -by others who will ask him to call them ''doctor.'' Add to this a hospital regime where, in the name of efficiency, a patient is deprived of rest and privacy by staff taking temperature and blood-pressure checks and blood samples at all hours of the day and night, and you have a recipe for turning almost any normal adult into an irrational child.</p>
        <p>The implications of Dr. Cassell's notion of the ''sickness state'' are not far short of alarming. If sickness alone can reduce the mental age of an adult to that of a 6-year-old, then what can ''informed consent'' - as a social value and a legal requirement -possibly mean?  SUSAN M.
