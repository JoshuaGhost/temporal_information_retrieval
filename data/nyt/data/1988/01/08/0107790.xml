        <p>LEAD: A Federal appeals court issued a brief order yesterday allowing the State Department to resume efforts to return a diplomat's 9-year-old son to Zimbabwe in a dispute growing out of accusations that the boy had been beaten by his father.</p>
        <p>A Federal appeals court issued a brief order yesterday allowing the State Department to resume efforts to return a diplomat's 9-year-old son to Zimbabwe in a dispute growing out of accusations that the boy had been beaten by his father.</p>
        <p>Legal Aid lawyers said the appeals court's order meant that the boy would be sent to Zimbabwe soon unless they could obtain quick action from the United States Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>After hearing arguments in Manhattan, the appeals court voted 2 to 1 to lift its temporary stay that had blocked efforts to send the boy home to Zimbabwe. His father, a Zimbabwean diplomat, was sent home last month.</p>
        <p>The removal of the stay, effective at noon tomorrow, allows the State Department to proceed under a previous ruling by Chief Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Federal District Court in Brooklyn. He has awarded custody of the child to the State Department, which wants to turn him over to Zimbabwean officials for his return home.</p>
        <p>If the child declines to return voluntarily to Zimbabwe, the family that has been caring for him on Long Island will receive a hearing by Judge Weinstein on whether the child's departure should be delayed any further, according to Government lawyers. White House Statement</p>
        <p>The child, Terrence Karamba, was taken to a foster-care home last month after officials of New York City and the Legal Aid Society complained that he had suffered severe beatings. His father, Floyd Karamba, was an attache at the Zimbabwean Mission to the United Nations.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the White House said President Reagan had been assured that the child would be adequately protected if returned to Zimbabwe and that the boy's father would not regain custody of him.</p>
        <p>At yesterday's hearing in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the three-judge panel asked numerous questions, with each judge stressing a different aspect of the dispute.</p>
        <p>Judge Ralph K. Winter sharply questioned whether anyone in this country had the legal authority to act as a guardian representing the child of a family that had diplomatic immunity. If authority could be exerted over a diplomat's child in the United States, he cautioned, foreign countries might exert similar authority over the children of American diplomats. 'Very Real Fear'</p>
        <p>Noting assurances by the State Department, Judge Frank X. Altimari said there seemed to be ''ample safeguards'' to protect the child in Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>Concern that the boy's father could regain custody of him was expressed by Judge Ellsworth A. Van Graafeiland, who later voted against lifting the stay.</p>
        <p>A Legal Aid lawyer, Henry Weintraub, told the judges that the child had ''a very real fear'' of returning to Zimbabwe and should not be forced to go without a hearing on his request for political asylum.</p>
        <p>A foster-care agency's lawyer, Joseph R. Carrieri, said the child needed psychological therapy before being sent home. He added that the child was receiving proper care with a family on Long Island.</p>
        <p>Arguing for the United States Government, Igou M. Allbray, said the court had no jurisdiction over the dispute, calling it a matter of executive power dealing with foreign nations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allbray, an assistant United States attorney, told the panel at a preliminary hearing on Monday that Zimbabwe was angry and was accusing the United States of ''kidnapping the child.''</p>
        <p>The original ruling by Judge Weinstein rejected a motion by Legal Aid lawyers to postpone the child's departure for Zimbabwe pending the outcome of a petition for asylum in the United States.</p>
        <p>The appeals court said it would issue a more extensive decision later, but Judge Van Graafeiland said that lifting the stay actually decided the case.</p>
