        <p>LEAD: The West German economy slowed in 1987 to its lowest growth rate in five years, with almost no expansion in the last three months, official figures released today confirmed.</p>
        <p>The West German economy slowed in 1987 to its lowest growth rate in five years, with almost no expansion in the last three months, official figures released today confirmed.</p>
        <p>The prospects of a weakening German economy is likely to bring louder calls from West Germany's trading partners, particularly the United States, for the Government to take more action to spur the economy.</p>
        <p>According to the Federal Statistics Office, West Germany's gross national product - the total output of goods and services - grew 1.7 percent last year, compared with 2.5 percent in 1986.</p>
        <p>Some economists have predicted that this year's growth would fall below 1.5 percent, the low end of the last Government forecast. Two major economic institutes, the Ifo and DIW, have projected expansion of only about 1 percent this year. And the Institut fur Deutschen Wirtschaft, an industry-backed research group, said it could be as low as three-fourths of 1 percent. Impact of Mark's Strength</p>
        <p>Egon Holder, president of the statistics office, said the growth data reflected the impact of an appreciating German mark and a fall-off in domestic demand. The figures are adjusted for inflation but remain subject to revision after all the latest data are in.</p>
        <p>According to the agency, the rate of growth in private and public consumption in West Germany fell, along with investment in construction. At the same time, inventories rose 2.2 percent, a fact that could prove troublesome this year.</p>
        <p>Despite the slower growth, the shrunken dollar and swollen mark helped push West Germany's nominal trade surplus to a record of 115.8 billion marks, or $70.4 billion, for 1987, surpassing the previous record of 112.6 billion marks in 1986, the statistics office reported.</p>
        <p>Though the figures are not likely to please Washington, analysts argued that West German imports were growing faster than exports in price-adjusted volume terms. On that basis, Mr. Holder said, West Germany's imports rose an estimated 5 percent last year while exports rose 2.4 percent. Budget Deficit Worrisome</p>
        <p>Despite the nation's sluggish growth, Bonn seems more immediately concerned with the projection of a budget deficit of 40 billion marks, or about $24.5 billion, a third higher than forecast. Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg touched off a sharp political dispute last week when he announced plans for higher consumer taxes on goods like gasoline and tobacco.</p>
        <p>The plan has come under sharp criticism within West Germany, and Richard Burt, the United States Ambassador, told West German reporters Tuesday that he considered the measures potentially ''counterproductive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burt said the Bonn Government ''has by no means used up all the possibilities available to gear up the economy.'' As examples, he mentioned the possibility of letting shops stay open later, lifting the state monopoly in telecommunications and cutting some taxes.</p>
