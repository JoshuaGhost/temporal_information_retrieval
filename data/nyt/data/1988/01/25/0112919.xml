        <p>LEAD: Arab foreign ministers today pledged moral and financial support to Palestinians who for nearly two months have been violently protesting the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Arab foreign ministers today pledged moral and financial support to Palestinians who for nearly two months have been violently protesting the Israeli occupation of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</p>
        <p>All 21 member countries of the Arab League were represented at an emergency meeting convened here in the Tunisian capital, where the organization has its headquarters.</p>
        <p>The participants did not set a figure, but voted to contribute to an ''uprising fund'' established last week by the Palestine Liberation Organization to provide food, medical needs and other services that have been disrupted by the unrest. The money would be provided for the duration of the protests, the officials said. Renewed Call for Conference</p>
        <p>The group also repeated calls for an international peace conference to resolve the issue of a Palestinian homeland, urged the United Nations to enforce relevant resolutions against the Israeli occupation and tactics against the protests and asked other nations to pressure Israel to end ''repression and tyranny'' in the territories.</p>
        <p>The Arab officials also set up a committee of the foreign ministers of Syria, Jordan, Algeria, Tunisia and Iraq and the league's secretary general to ask the United Nations ''to sponsor the withdrawal of Israeli occupation forces and to put the Palestinian people in a position to exercise their rights to self-determination in conformity with relevant U.N. resolutions.'' The committee would also lobby for the Arab position on the issue.  In adopting that resolution, the body rejected a proposal by Syria and Libya to demand that Egypt end diplomatic relations with Israel. Peace Force Not Discussed</p>
        <p>A P.L.O. proposal that the United Nations send a peacekeeping force to take over the territories was not discussed. One official said it was ''unrealistic, an idea whose time has not come.''</p>
        <p>After the meeting, officials said they were pleased with the action taken. Chedli Klibi, the Arab League secretary general, said at a news conference, ''Usually there are many differences on our problems. But on this question, there is a new spirit of unity, a new spirit of togetherness.</p>
        <p>A Lebanese official said the achievement of the meeting was ''the decision to give support, political action and financial assistance to needy people.''</p>
        <p>The meeting was the second in less than two months by the league to deal with the protests, and was proposed by Libya. It was called in advance of several events next week that bear on the region, including a meeting of the United Nations Security Council on the disturbances and a visit to Washington by the Egyptian President, Hosni Mubarak. President Reagan has invited Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel to Washington for discussions of the issue in March.</p>
