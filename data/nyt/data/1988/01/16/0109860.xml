        <p>LEAD: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the most powerful symbol of authority in the Soviet Union, met in the Kremlin today with Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel laureate once made an outcast here for defending the rights of the individual.</p>
        <p>Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the most powerful symbol of authority in the Soviet Union, met in the Kremlin today with Andrei D. Sakharov, the Nobel laureate once made an outcast here for defending the rights of the individual.</p>
        <p>At the meeting Dr. Sakharov, who was freed from internal exile by Mr. Gorbachev 13 months ago, renewed his calls for the release of imprisoned Soviet dissidents and for freedom for Soviet citizens to emigrate, according to the American industrialist Armand Hammer, a participant at the meeting.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hammer said in an interview that Mr. Gorbachev ''didn't respond -he just accepted the list'' of imprisoned dissidents offered by Dr. Sakharov.</p>
        <p>The meeting of the two men came in a three-hour session with members of a newly formed group called the International Fund for the Survival of Humanity. It marked the first time since the founding of the Soviet human rights movement in the late 1960's that a Soviet leader has met such a prominent internal critic. Meeting Is Televised</p>
        <p>Television footage of the meeting, showing Dr. Sakharov's balding and slightly stooped figure behind a table, a small smile on his face, was broadcast on the national evening news program ''Vremya.''</p>
        <p>As the image appeared on the screen the announcer intoned the list of participants in alphabetical order: ''. . .Roald Sagdeyev, Soviet Union. Andrei Sakharov, Soviet Union. Michael Sela, Israel. . ..''</p>
        <p>The Soviet press agency Tass tonight also ran an item in Russian and English on Dr. Sakharov's remarks at a news conference afterward, during which he called for a ''quick withdrawal'' of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>Many here say it was Dr. Sakharov's criticism of the Soviet sweep into Afghanistan in 1979 that led to his being forcibly exiled to the city of Gorky, 250 miles east of Moscow, which is closed to foreigners.</p>
        <p>Since his return to Moscow in December 1986, Dr. Sakharov has offered cautious support for Mr. Gorbachev's initiatives to relax restrictions in Soviet society. But he also has quietly continued his calls for an end to the persecution of dissenters.</p>
        <p>Interviewed after a news conference introducing the fund, Dr. Sakharov praised Mr. Gorbachev, saying, ''I think this kind of leader is needed in a great country at such a decisive moment in history.'' Industrialists and Scientists</p>
        <p>Dr. Sakharov is one of 30 board members of the fund, described as a private research group designed to study a variety of issues including the arms race, poverty, pollution, hunger and human rights violations.</p>
        <p>According to an aide to Dr. Hammer, who is also on the board, the organization grew out of talks between Jerome B. Weisner, former president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Yevgeny P. Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>The board is made up of academics, scientists, industrialists and religious leaders from a number of countries.</p>
        <p>Members include Robert S. MacNamara, the former Defense Secretary ; Susan Eisenhower, granddaughter of Dwight D. Eisenhower and the head of a public relations firm with foreign and domestic interests; Jeremy Stone, head of the Federation of Concerned Scientists, a group seeking nuclear disarmament, and Rabbi Arthur Schneier, senior rabbi at the Park East Synagogue at 163 East 67th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>During the meeting Mr. Gorbachev ''was in great form,'' Dr. Hammer said. ''He was very quick and witty and at the same time very patient. Every member around the table spoke and he listened to everyone. He was in great spirits.'' Discussion on Afghanistan</p>
        <p>After the meeting Mr. Gorbachev asked Dr. Hammer, who has dealt with Soviet leaders for decades, to stay and discuss the situation in Afghanistan, Dr. Hammer said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Velikhov was asked after the meeting whether Dr. Sakharov would be allowed to leave the Soviet Union to attend meetings of the fund - which will have offices in Moscow, Stockholm and Washington. He said the question would be decided by visa authorities.</p>
        <p>Since Dr. Sakharov's work on the Soviet hydrogen bomb in the late 1940's and early 1950's he has not been allowed to travel abroad. He gradually parted company with the Soviet scientific establishment in the 1960's as he began to question the morality of nuclear weapons, and allied himself with the Soviet human rights movement, which grew to international prominence in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>In 1975 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work on behalf of human rights.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sakharov was ordered into internal exile beginning in January 1980, a move that marked the nadir of the human rights movement here. His return to Moscow at the end of 1986 marked the beginning of a year of rolling back the attack on dissent in which scores of political and religious dissidents were released.</p>
