        <p>LEAD: DESPITE its relatively low profile among New York City's leading art institutions, the Brooklyn Museum remains conspicuously active. Three diverse shows have recently been mounted by the ambitious institution, which at the same time is organizing a tremendous expansion. Starting next Friday, master plans by the five finalists who competed to redesign the museum will be publicly displayed for the first time.</p>
        <p>DESPITE its relatively low profile among New York City's leading art institutions, the Brooklyn Museum remains conspicuously active. Three diverse shows have recently been mounted by the ambitious institution, which at the same time is organizing a tremendous expansion. Starting next Friday, master plans by the five finalists who competed to redesign the museum will be publicly displayed for the first time. The jury's choice, a team headed by Arata Isozaki and James Stewart Polshek, is already plotting the first phase - renovation of the old west wing - in an effort intended eventually to double the institution's current size.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Brooklyn has imported ''Assemblage of Spirits'' from the Minneapolis Institute of Arts: an extraordinary exhibition of intricate, provocative, elaborately decorated carvings and sculptures made by residents of New Ireland, a small island that forms part of Papua New Guinea. Concurrently, the Brooklyn's curators have mounted a retrospective of Alex Katz's prints that now fills the prints and drawings galleries, and they have commissioned the large, curious installation by Daniel Buren crowding the museum's grand lobby.</p>
        <p>The strange, brightly painted, delicately crafted works that make up ''Assemblage of Spirits'' - carved during the last part of the 19th century and the first decades of the 20th - depict complex conflations of human and animal forms and contain symbolic meanings ambiguous even to those who made them. Wood, sponge, seashells, fiber and stone have all been employed in the making of these objects, which, points out William Siegmann, a curator at the Brooklyn Museum, are strikingly different from anything else produced by the cultures of Oceania.</p>
        <p>These are remnants of an elaborate - and still existent - ritual indigenous to the people who live on the north coast of the little-known South Pacific island. Following the death of a community leader, family members arrange what is called a malagan: the funerary festival, sometimes taking more than a dozen years to organize following the death and lasting up to several weeks, involves the creation of masks, poles, friezes and other sculptured and assembled objects. A malagan concludes with the initiation of young community members into the adults' ranks. It thus serves both as a ceremony of death and a ritual of social rejuvenation.</p>
        <p>As the exhibition and the outstanding accompanying catalogue emphasize, malagan is in many respects as interesting for what it reveals about the social ties binding the diverse peoples of New Ireland as it is for the carved works produced. By requiring for its organization the assistance and financial support of an extended family, this ceremony brings together in a display of solidarity the clans of the island at precisely the time when a leading member of the community has died. To commission the carvings and to organize the accompanying feasts, dances and other performances that are part of a malagan, favors are both requested and returned, establishing a network of obligations that acts as a kind of informal economic bond among New Ireland residents.</p>
        <p>The ceremony consists of several phases, one of which calls for the use of masks and the last of which involves the other wooden carvings. These have been painstakingly executed by artisans behind a makeshift wall, and are revealed to the assembled community only at the conclusion of the malagan, when the wall is ripped down.</p>
        <p>The works themselves, considered by the family to have served their purpose once the malagan ends, are discarded or left to rot - so it is largely thanks to the curiosity of European visitors and collectors that New Ireland carvings from decades ago have survived. ''Assemblage of Spirits'' brings together objects from collections in West Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and the United States.</p>
        <p>The iconography of malagan objects is at once obscure and revealing. Only certain creatures are included in the repertory of images or motifs, and they seem to reflect aspects of social or spiritual order in New Ireland. Birds, fish and snakes are commonplace; clans associate with specific creatures and they own certain motifs, much as a company owns a trademark. These can be used by others only if purchased from the clan. Some of the images are based on the dreams of clan members; many have no specific meaning. But most contain references in one way or another to the notion of transformation - from one creature to another, from social instability to social order, from life to death - a notion central to the spirit of the malagan.</p>
        <p>The objects are symmetrical in design, full of elaborate, open-work carving, and covered in stripes, patches and dashs of colorful pigment. There are fantastical, sometimes frightening, often confusing-to-read creatures - winged, batlike humans, snakes that emerge from a bird's head and disappear into an open human mouth; ears made of fishes and crustaceans.</p>
        <p>The inventiveness, variety and liveliness of these forms, their spirited, complex application of color, their potent expression all strike the untutored Western eye. Whatever they may signify to the New Irelanders who made and employed them as part of the ritual cycle that constitutes malagan, these carvings have a grace and eloquence that transcends cultural boundaries.</p>
        <p>Louise Lincoln deserves credit as the Minneapolis curator who put together ''Assemblage of Spirits'' and who wrote the introduction to the catalogue. Mr. Siegmann and Jeffrey Strean handled the show's smart and handsome Brooklyn installation.</p>
        <p>A retrospective of Alex Katz's prints spills across the Brooklyn Museum's second-floor balcony, filling that rambling space with rows of civilized, well-dressed, blank-faced portraits. The medium seems to suit Mr. Katz, whose painted figures, stripped to the bone in descriptive detail, already have a generic, one-in-a-series quality.</p>
        <p>The artist has long juxtaposed big, oddly shaped forms, and there is to his paintings something distinctly posterlike - all big, flat, hard-edged surfaces. The prints echo on a modest scale what Mr. Katz has attempted with canvas and paint.</p>
        <p>There are 63 works in this exhibition, dating back to 1951; a third of them are black and white, but the most beautiful are principally among the ones in color. A viewer is often reminded of the artist's admiration for Matisse - notice, for instance, how black, bone and bright red vivify Mr. Katz's ''Red Coat'' (1983).</p>
        <p>Moods swing: a striking lithograph of Edwin Denby is a hot, jazzy yellow; with ''Sunset: Lake Wesserunsett I,'' a soft-edged homage to the pastoral landscape, Mr. Katz's palette turns to muted blues and grays. Alongside the graceful, lightly colored woodcuts are witty, standing cut-out figures of the artist's wife, Ada. It is the bigger, graphically bolder prints - especially the portraits most reminiscent of Mr. Katz's large-scale paintings - that have the liveliest snap.</p>
        <p>''Alex Katz: A Print Retrospective'' has been organized by Barry Walker, an associate curator at the Brooklyn Museum, who wrote the essay accompanying the exhibition catalogue.</p>
        <p>Immediately confronting a visitor to the Brooklyn Museum is Daniel Buren's ''Reverberation,'' an architectural assemblage that fills this grand lobby. It is the latest in a series of installations sponsored by the museum. The Conceptual artist has caused a stir in his native France for recently planting 252 striped marble-and-concrete columns of varying heights in the stately courtyard of the Palais Royal in Paris. He has here created something imposing but benign - a decorative, temporary art gallery of stretched canvas and wood.</p>
        <p>Arranged like a classical grid, ''The Reverberation'' is a series of small, square rooms that function both as passageways and as exhibition spaces into which Mr. Buren placed divergent examples from the Brooklyn collection. The bright, multi-colored canvas sheets that serve to divide the squares are striped, like all of Mr. Buren's works, in the manner of beach chairs, so that wandering through this space can evoke the unexpected, cheering, no doubt unintended feeling of a walk among seaside cabanas. There's something subtly but appealingly disorienting to ''Reverberation,'' as well. One peers at the paintings, sculptures and pieces of furniture that have been displayed in the exhibition ''rooms'' through small windows cut into the canvas sheets, as if observing specimens in a laboratory. With this installation, Mr. Buren has created an odd sort of homage to the Brooklyn Museum - transforming its visitors into voyeurs and its objects into curios.</p>
        <p>''Assemblage of Spirits'' remains at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Washington Avenue, in the Crown Heights section, through May 9; ''Alex Katz: A Print Retrospective'' runs through April 11; Daniel Buren's ''Reverberation'' stays on view in the museum's grand lobby through April 25.</p>
