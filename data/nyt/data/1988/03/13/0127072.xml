        <p>A woman alledgedly hurled her weeping 2-month-old son from a third-floor window in the Bronx yesterday, but the baby's fall was broken by an overhang above the entrance to the building, the police said.</p>
        <p>The woman, Marie Louisa Diaz, 25 years old, was arrested and charged with second-degree attempted murder, endangering the welfare of a child and assault, said a police spokesman, Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell. The unharmed baby was taken to Jacobi Hospital and was listed in good condition, said the hospital's associate director of nursing, Lucille Saner.</p>
        <p>Sergeant O'Donnell said the incident occurred at 3:05 P.M. when Mrs. Diaz, apparently upset because her son was crying, went to the window of her apartment at 890 Elsmere Place in the South Bronx and, witnesses said, threw him out.</p>
