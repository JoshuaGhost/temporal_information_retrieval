        <p>LEAD: That classic of childhood games, skipping rope, has a new look and feel these days. Professional athletes have always known its value for fitness training. But most adults left their jump ropes in the toy box.</p>
        <p>That classic of childhood games, skipping rope, has a new look and feel these days. Professional athletes have always known its value for fitness training. But most adults left their jump ropes in the toy box.</p>
        <p>Flexion, a sports-fitness company in York, Neb., has redesigned the jump rope to offer an overall workout. Conventional jump ropes are made with hand grips horizontal to the rope. Flexion's Aerope comes with weighted handles that are attached in a perpendicular fashion. The rope works off a pivot made of nylon, Teflon and a fiberglass composite. The Teflon acts as a lubricant to reduce wear as the pivot moves on a shaft of steel within the grip. Weights that can be inserted into the handles are available.</p>
        <p>Frank Joutras, inventor of the Aerope, says that the design reduces the wrist fatigue that comes with standard jump ropes. ''This rope allows you to keep jumping until your body is tired instead of having to stop because your wrists are worn out,'' he said. Joutras says he developed the idea in consultation with fitness experts.</p>
        <p>The product comes with a training program and tips on determining maximum heart rate. A leather Aerope costs about $25; a polyester version costs about $20. Both ropes are adjustable. For information, call (800) 222-5778.</p>
