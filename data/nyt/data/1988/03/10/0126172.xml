        <p>The European Commission announced today that it was closing its investigation of the merger of British Airways and British Caledonian Airways after British Airways had made ''major new undertakings aimed at safeguarding airline competition.'' The commission said that</p>
        <p>British Airways had made concessions in applying for European route licenses previously held by British Caledonian Airways. The concessions will apply for four years, and British Airways must report to the commission every six months until the end of 1992.</p>
        <p>''The commission's decision clears the way for full implementation of the merger so its benefits can be achieved with as little delay as possible,'' said Sir Colin Marshall, the chief executive of British Airways. The Monopolies and Mergers</p>
        <p>Commission required British Airways to surrender British Caledonian's domestic route licenses.</p>
