        <p>LEAD: Bond prices moved moderately higher in subdued trading yesterday as investors turned from a declining stock market to the relative stability of Government securities.</p>
        <p>Bond prices moved moderately higher in subdued trading yesterday as investors turned from a declining stock market to the relative stability of Government securities.</p>
        <p>Market participants remained nervous about the course of the dollar, which continued to weaken in foreign-exchange trading, dealers said. They attributed the muted volume to the lack of participation by institutional investors, mutual funds and money managers who were wary of committing themselves before the weekend. Oil Prices Advance</p>
        <p>For most of the day, oil prices, whose rise has been a concern in the credit markets all week, were steady and apparently not a major factor in trading. But late in the day, crude-oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed above $17 for the first time since mid-February.</p>
        <p>The dollar's weakness and fears of inflation continued to be factors in the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average continued its sharp decline, falling 44.92 points, to 1,978.95.</p>
        <p>As stocks continued to fall, demand picked up for Government fixed-income securities. By late in the day, the bellwether long-term bond, the 30-year Treasury issue, had climbed about three-fourths of a point, to 102 6/32, to yield 8.66 percent. Among medium-term maturities, the 8 1/8 percent notes due in 1998 closed up about a half a percentage point, to 97, and now yield 8.42 percent.</p>
        <p>''The bond market rebounded somewhat from previous sessions which had slumped sharply,'' said Theodore Tung, chief economist at the National City Corporation in Cleveland. ''Its movement again was closely tied to that of the dollar, which fell abruptly on Thursday but showed signs of stabilizing on Friday.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Tung warned that the credit market was not completely out of its recent bearish mood. ''A stream of positive economic reports has dispelled fear of a recession and thus expectations of lower interest rates,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David J. Walker, chief economist for the People's Bank of Bridgeport, Conn., said his institution was optimistic that interest rates would fall soon but he expressed concern about the longer-term outlook.</p>
        <p>''We feel the 30-year Government bonds and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages could fall by as much as 75 basis points over the next few months as inflation holds at levels below 4 percent,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, by year-end, there is a significant probability that inflation could rise above 5 percent and consequently push mortgage rates to 11 percent and long-term governments to 9 3/4 percent.''</p>
        <p>In the short-term end of the market, the rate for three-month bills slipped 12 basis points, to 5.70 percent, while the six-month issue dipped seven basis points, to 5.94 percent. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>In the corporate bond market, the Transamerica Financial Corporation, a unit of the Transamerica Corporation, is offering $100 million (New Zealand) of 14 percent notes due in 1991 through underwriters led by Prudential-Bache Capital funding. The three-year notes are offered at a price of par to yield about one and a half percentage points less than the New Zealand 90-day bank bill rate.</p>
        <p>Underwriters said that following each quarter the coupon on the notes would be reset 1.85 percentage points under the New Zealand rate. The notes are rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A+ by the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation.</p>
