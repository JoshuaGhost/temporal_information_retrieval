        <p>Eugene H. Remmer, the founder and chairman of Chemtex Inc., an engineering company that specialized in the export of technology to developing countries, died of cancer Saturday at Presbyterian Hospital. He was 64 years old and lived in Old Greenwich, Conn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Remmer, who established Chemtex in 1958, had also been president of its national and international subsidiaries until October. The company specialized in the design of plants and equipment to make synthetic fibers and films and introduced them to countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Central and South America.</p>
        <p>Mr. Remmer graduated from Columbia University with degrees in the humanities and in engineering in 1943. He had been a university trustee since 1982 and at his death he was chairman of the trustees' building and grounds committee and was a member of the executive and finance committees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Remmer, who was an oarsman in his undergraduate years, was captain of the varsity boat in his junior and senior years. He received the Alumni Athletic Award in 1981.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Patricia Cady; a son, Steven, of Bainbridge Island, Wash.; three daughters, Anne Cole and Susan Ryzewic, both of Manhattan, and Ellen, of Boston; two brothers, George, of Oakdale, L.I., and Henry, of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., and two sisters, Nita Redding of Singer Island, Fla., and Carol Angle of Omaha.</p>
