        <p>LEAD: As a youth he was a rebel. All he wanted from life was the freedom to paint abstract and Surrealist art. But Sujiwo Kusumo was dealt another fate: on his shoulders fell a Javanese kingship.</p>
        <p>As a youth he was a rebel. All he wanted from life was the freedom to paint abstract and Surrealist art. But Sujiwo Kusumo was dealt another fate: on his shoulders fell a Javanese kingship.</p>
        <p>In January, at 37 years of age, Mr. Sujiwo became Kanjeng Gusti Pangeran Aryo Mangkunegoro, the ninth ruler of a royal family whose imperial history is intricately woven into the animist-Hindu-Buddhist-Islamic culture of Central Java.</p>
        <p>How he handles a new era of kingship in Java, where the majority of Indonesians live and whose culture dominates the national Government, is being closely watched in this old city known more commonly as Solo.</p>
        <p>His Highness Mangkunegoro, who inherited the title at the death of his father, Mangkunegoro VIII, has already faced a rival claim to the throne from an uncle. A modern man, the young ruler agreed to drop the IX from his title as a compromise and keep, as he describes it, a ''low profile.'' Court Ritual to Remain</p>
        <p>He greets a visitor to his 18th-century teakwood palace wearing jeans and a cream-colored sports coat. He dislikes ceremony.</p>
        <p>But the responsibility of his heritage weighs heavily on him. Though he knows the palace compound and family agricultural lands need more modern management, the elaborate court ritual of Java will remain, he says. There will still be court dancing and the playing of a Javanese gong orchestra every Wednesday in the large, open audience hall.</p>
        <p>''The people don't want to lose this,'' he said. ''It has been here a long, long time.''</p>
        <p>His Highness Mangkunegoro has no political power: the Republic of Indonesia stripped its royal families of that in 1946. But to the sophisticated society of Central Java, layered since the first and second centuries A.D. with accretions of mythology, that did not make too much difference.</p>
        <p>''It is difficult for us, being Javanese, to ignore our mystical way of thinking,'' said Bakdi Soemanto, a scholar at the Center for Cultural Research at Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta, and a distant relative of the Mangkunegaran family.</p>
        <p>''To us, the King is still a representative of a supernatural power,'' he said. All Javanese monarchs are believed to be husbands of Raden Loro Kidul, the Queen of the Southern Oceans, who waits under the waves at Parangtritis on the southern Javanese coast to lure men to their deaths in a wild sea. #4 Royal Households The Mangkunegaran family is one of four royal households in Central Java, the result of divisions two centuries ago among the inheritors of the ancient Mataram empire. Solo, a center of traditional art, has two imposing kraton, or Javanese palaces: the Mangkunegaran and the Hadiningrat.</p>
        <p>Jogjakarta, about 40 miles to the southwest, also has two traditional rulers: Paku Alam and the Sultan Hamengku Buwono, whose palace dominates the town center.</p>
        <p>While other Javanese rulers might be inclined to foster auras of mystic power, the present Mankunegoro is without artifice. He chats openly about his life, with its hopes and disappointments.</p>
        <p>He remembers a happy childhood in the palace, where there was a play group and schools attended by the seven children of Mangkunegoro VIII. Then he became a rebellious teen-ager, turning to motorcycles and modern art.</p>
        <p>He recalls the reaction of his father, who was also a painter, but given to naturalism, as being: ''Art? Oh no!'' ''I was compelled by my parents to enroll at Gadjah Mada University, to study international relations,'' His Highness said in Bahasa Indonesia, the national language, through an aide and interpreter who spoke to him only in the highest level of Javanese, reserved for rulers.</p>
        <p>''I was not allowed to go to the art academy,'' he said. ''But my soul was hungry for art. You know, when my parents were still alive I was not allowed to go to my canvas because if I did that I would waste my time. I was not allowed to paint in the Surrealistic, abstract style. I am just learning that now.'' One Year at the University</p>
        <p>The Prince, also a photographer, lasted one year at the university.</p>
        <p>In 1973, the young man, second in line to the throne to an elder brother whose career was in the military police, was sent to work for the American oil company Caltex in Sumatra. It was an interlude that brings animation to his voice.</p>
        <p>''I enjoyed very much the American life style,'' he said, describing how he got up early to jog and eat with a crew teaching him firefighting techniques.</p>
        <p>He liked the action, and was fascinated by the firemen's skills.</p>
        <p>A year later, he married Sukmawati, a daughter of the late President Sukarno, who was also ''a litle rebellious,'' Professor Bakdi Soemanto said. The marriage ended in divorce. His two children, 11 and 13, live in Jakarta with their mother and go to school there.</p>
        <p>''They are too young to live here,'' he said. ''I want to teach them to stand on their own feet. When they are older I will bring them to the kraton.'' Brother Dies in Accident</p>
        <p>In 1977, his elder brother was killed in a traffic accident. For the younger Prince, the preparation for a royal life began. But slowly.</p>
        <p>''I am young and used to joining in the activities of ordinary people -and I like to do things for myself,'' he said, waving to some startled tourists on a palace tour. He said he wanted to keep the palace open to the public ''to show that there is still life here.''</p>
        <p>''After being crowned Mangkunegoro, there seemed to be a gap between me and the people,'' he said. ''It's because of my position. They have more respect for me. But I do the same for them.''</p>
        <p>''Some people still call me Sujiwo,'' he added. ''I don't mind. We have to make these changes step by step.''</p>
