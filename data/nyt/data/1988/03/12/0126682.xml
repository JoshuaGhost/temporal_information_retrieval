        <p>LEAD: Every day before she sets off to work, Roberta Berk, a 48-year-old commodities broker, takes one aspirin, 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 1,000 milligrams of calcium, an antihistamine tablet and powdered fiber in water.</p>
        <p>Every day before she sets off to work, Roberta Berk, a 48-year-old commodities broker, takes one aspirin, 500 milligrams of vitamin C, 1,000 milligrams of calcium, an antihistamine tablet and powdered fiber in water.</p>
        <p>She is not ill. She is not following doctor's orders. Nor is she obsessed with her health. She is like many Americans, medicating herself in pursuit of some ideal of wellness.</p>
        <p>Inspired by advertising, medical news and a culture that has made excellent health a principal value, people are consuming a growing number of health products.</p>
        <p>The boundaries of self-treatment keep expanding, as the status of some medications changes from prescription to over-the-counter and as medical findings suggest regimens that can be pursued without a physician's supervision.</p>
        <p>The latest frontier is aspirin. After a widely publicized study suggested that aspirin could prevent heart disease, aspirin makers began advertising campaigns to promote awareness of the study. Last week, the ads were suspended at the request of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>The medical profession, which has been criticized for intimidating patients, seems in no mood for a fight with consumers on most self-medication. But there is concern.</p>
        <p>''There is no totally safe medication known to man,'' said Dr. James S. Todd, senior deputy executive vice president of the American Medical Association. ''There are no innocuous drugs, and the lay person is in no position to judge. There are so many drugs available today and so many people on multiple drugs that it is not so much the individual drug about which you are concerned but what happens with combinations.''</p>
        <p>The publicity about aspirin heightened such worries, since the drug can pose risks, among them hemorrhagic strokes.</p>
        <p>''When articles about the report were printed, I had several patients ask if it would be a good idea to take it,'' said Dr. Ralph O. Wallerstein, president of the American College of Physicians and a clinical professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine. ''Then they admitted that they had already begun doing so.''  Preliminary Findings</p>
        <p>The Food and Drug Administration said the ads suggesting aspirin as a means to ward off a first heart attack were halted because those findings were still preliminary. Henry Dausch, an assistant to the Commissioner of the F.D.A., said the companies agreed not to promote aspirin as a preventive for first heart attacks, ''until such time as that study is completed, reviewed by the F.D.A. and appropriate professional labeling for use by physicians has been developed.''</p>
        <p>Aspirin ads directed at those who have had heart attacks are unaffected. However there seems to be confusion among Food and Drug Administration and Federal Trade Commission officials as to precisly what can be said - or implied - in those ads.</p>
        <p>Self-treatment goes beyond over-the-counter medications. People take leftover antibiotics and share tranquilizers. Travelers bring home medications that are not approved in this country. Californians, for example, are flocking to the Mexican border to buy Retin-A, which received national attention after a study found that it reduced wrinkles. Retin-A has not yet been approved for that purpose in this country.</p>
        <p>The main action, though, is in the drugstore, supermarket and health-food store aisles. Last year, Americans spent $12 billion on over-the-counter medications and vitamins. ''There are about 300,000 over-the-counter products on the market, which represent various combinations of the 725 approved active ingredients,'' said Michael Lessing, special assistant to the director of over-the-counter drug evaluation at the F.D.A. These products include those repackaged into store brands and locally made items.</p>
        <p>According to Jim Callandrillo, project manager at Kline &amp; Company, a Fairfield, N.J., market research concern, Americans' spending on over-the-counter medicines and vitamins has grown 43 percent since 1982.</p>
        <p>The commercials that remind viewers that they ''haven't got time for the pain'' or that show how astronauts cope with stuffy noses are one reason. ''The nonprescription companies spend a greater percentage, by a few points, of their sales on advertising than do the manufacturers of cosmetics, toiletries or household cleansers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Economic and social considerations have also been factors. A recent symposium on self-medication sponsored by the F.D.A. and the Proprietary Association, a trade organization for over-the-counter manufacturers, provided some perspective. Dr. Frank Young, Commissioner of the F.D.A., told the meeting: ''Six out of every 10 medicines bought by American consumers are nonprescription products. Yet total spending for self-medication products adds up to less than two cents of the U.S. health-care dollar. Self-care, therefore, is the largest component of our health-care system and the least costly.''</p>
        <p>''There are now roughly 35 million people in this country without any health insurance,'' said Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of political economy at Princeton University. ''Even those who are insured are not often covered for the kind of doctor's visit at which you get prescriptions -80 percent of all ambulatory visits are not covered - so going to the doctor has become a big-ticket item, and over all the number of visits are down per capita.''  'You Will Try Anything'</p>
        <p>Melvin A. Glasser, director of the Health Security Action Council, a consumer advocacy organzation in Washington, agreed. ''If you don't have health insurance, if you are in a low-income bracket and if there is an illness, you will try any way you can to take care of yourself,'' he said. ''And that leads to self-medication.'' But so does life in more prosperous circumstances. ''A busy Manhattan person can spare two minutes to go to the drugstore, but an appointment can take hours,'' said Dr. Harvey Klein, an internist and a professor of clinical medicine at Cornell University Medical College. ''He or she may feel, 'If I can invest five minutes and feel better, why not?' The American public believes that for every ill, there's a pill - that everything can be treated.''</p>
        <p>People are also more involved in their treatment. ''The patient has taken on a new and more elaborate role,'' said Dr. Arthur J. Barsky, an associate professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School.</p>
        <p>''In the past,'' he said, ''you went to the doctor, dumped your problem in his lap and did what he said. Now you don't trust him. You get second opinions, read encyclopedias and monitor your own course.''</p>
        <p>Home testing kits have helped make patients more independent, as has the switching of such products as ibuprofen from prescription to over-the-counter status.  Some Benefits Seen</p>
        <p>Some physicians see benefits in the growth of over-the-counter products. ''I like the availability of medications that allow free choice by individuals, so I favor this and do not worry much about abuse,'' said Dr. James F. Fries, an associate professor of medicine at the Stanford University School of Medicine.</p>
        <p>Others express concern about excessive use of medications by the elderly and about the ability of the products to mask symptoms of disease.</p>
        <p>Where should self-treatment stop and professional care take over?</p>
        <p>Dr. Jerry Avorn, an associate professor of medicine and health policy at the Harvard Medical School and an internist at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, said: ''There is a fair amount you can do for yourself, as long as you are careful. The patient ought to be responsible for reading the package information carefully and not just assume that if a product is available, it must be totally safe. Find a pharmacist capable of doing patient counseling about self-medication, and if the one you have cannot, find another.''</p>
        <p>What to do when in doubt about the severity of the ailment? ''It is always better to bother the physician than to call in the middle of the night from the emergency room,'' he said.</p>
