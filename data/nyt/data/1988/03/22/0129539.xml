        <p>Brian O'Connor's amiable brand of character comedy cuts against the prevailing grain of humor that stalks its prey with lethal weapons concealed under a veneer of cool. In his one-man show, ''One Hour Out of Your Life,'' which opened a three-night run at the Judith Anderson Theater on Thursday, Mr. O'Connor impersonated 10 characters. Some were celebrities like Steven Wright, whose skewed mottoes he imitated with a perfect deadpan accuracy. Others were poignant, fictional losers with whom he clearly sympathized.</p>
        <p>A strain of conceptual whimsy informed many of Mr. O'Connor's comic conceptions. In a skit called ''Typewriter,'' he imagined verbal skirmishes between words that could be the left-hand keys of the keyboard and those on the right. In another skit he played an English rock musician visiting a nursery to see his newborn illegitimate son and promising that someday the infant would be the best man at his wedding.</p>
        <p>The evening's most poignant skit found Mr. O'Connor playing a naive young beer vendor messing up on his first day of work in a ballpark. In the darkest skit he portrayed a half-crazed theater janitor who had rationalized his failure to become a star as being a deliberate and heroic choice.</p>
        <p>If Mr. O'Connor is intelligently, likably zany, his humor shies almost completely away from taking psychological risks. In a broad spoof of Bobbie Gentry singing ''Ode to Billie Joe,'' the song's title character became ''Billy Joel jumping off the Verrazano Bridge.'' For both Mr. O'Connor and the audience, the laughter came from a very safe and comfortable place.</p>
