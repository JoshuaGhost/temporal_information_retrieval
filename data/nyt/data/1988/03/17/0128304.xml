        <p>LEAD: Radiation Technology Inc., a Rockaway Township-based company that uses radiation to sterilize spices and medical equipment, pleaded guilty today to charges that it submitted falsified documents to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission concerning safety procedures at its plant in Rockaway.</p>
        <p>Radiation Technology Inc., a Rockaway Township-based company that uses radiation to sterilize spices and medical equipment, pleaded guilty today to charges that it submitted falsified documents to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission concerning safety procedures at its plant in Rockaway.</p>
        <p>The company also admitted that its officials had lied to N.R.C. investigators and radiation specialists about the length of time it operated without radiation safety monitoring equipment in place.</p>
        <p>The company faces fines of up to $1 million at sentencing by Federal District Judge Maryanne Trump Barry on May 3.</p>
        <p>The guilty pleas were entered on behalf of the company by its president, Allan K. Booth. Pled Guilty to Conspiracy</p>
        <p>The company's former chief executive officer, Martin A. Welt, had been scheduled to plead guilty this morning to unspecified charges, but his attorney, Theodore Wells, called Judge Barry to say that Mr. Welt would not appear.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the Rockaway plant's former operations manager, Thomas Powell, 50 years old, of Lake Hopatcong, pleaded guilty to a conspiracy charge. He faces up to five years in prison and fines of up to $250,000, said the United States Attorney for New Jersey, Samuel A. Alito Jr. Mr. Alito said that other company officials had been involved in the conspiracy to mislead N.R.C. investigators and that the investigation was continuing.</p>
        <p>''Their actions posed a very serious threat to human life and health,'' he said. ''Companies engaged in this business have to be absolutely truthful with the N.R.C. It's a matter of extreme importance.''</p>
        <p>Radiation Technology, which reported sales of $2.1 million in 1986, also operates irradiation plants in Salem, Haw River, N.C., and West Memphis, Ark. It had also planned to build a food-irradiation plant in Elizabeth on property of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey but withdrew that proposal last July, according to Alan Morrison, a spokesman for the authority.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued at company headquarters, officers said that no one had been exposed to radiation and that the lapses in safety standards ''did not result in any health injury to R.T.I. employees or to the general public.'' 'A Serious Situation'</p>
        <p>Jacqueline C. Wolff, the assistant United States attorney handling the case, said her office had no indication that employees had been exposed to harmful levels of radiation. She added, however, that the effects of exposure do not manifest themselves for about 10 to 20 years.</p>
        <p>''Anytime there is the possibility of exposure, it can be considered a serious situation,'' said Chester White, director of the N.R.C.'s office of investigation in the Newark area.</p>
        <p>The company statement said that those officials involved in the cover-up had been dismissed and that a new management team was complying fully with the investigation. The company is operating under a provisional license from the N.R.C. and is under close scrutiny by the agency. Bypassing Safety Devices</p>
        <p>Mr. Alito said the N.R.C. had begun an inquiry in 1984 based on a tip.</p>
        <p>The company was accused of giving a false document to investigators in January 1986 by issuing a memorandum back-dated to September 21, 1984, stating that employees of the Rockaway plant had been directed to stop bypassing devices called conveyor door safety interlocks, which prevent workers from inadvertent exposure to a radioactive source. That source, cobalt 60, is used at the plant to destroy microbes in spices and medical equipment by bombarding the products with radiation.</p>
        <p>The company was accused of knowing that no such directive had been issued on the 1984 date and that ''the officers and employees had continued to defeat the conveyor door safety interlocks as a routine matter since that time.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the company was accused of lying to N.R.C. investigators about the operation of a radiation safety monitor, which automatically locks doors and prevent workers from entering the radiation cell area when there were high levels of raditation. Company employees told N.R.C. investigators that the device had been removed for only one night, ''when, in fact, defendants's employees knew full well that the radiation safety monitor had been removed for several days, during which time the Rockaway plant continued to irradiate product,'' prosecutors said in court papers.</p>
        <p>Irradiation is used to sterilize foods and thereby increase their shelf life. Although the Federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the irradiation of fruits and vegetables, spices and pork, public skepticism about the safety of the products has remained high.</p>
        <p>Early this year Governor Kean vetoed a bill that would have banned the sale of all irradiated foods in New Jersey, with the exception of spices.</p>
