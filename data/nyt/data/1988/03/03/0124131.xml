        <p>LEAD: Representative Richard A. Gephardt stood in the rain outside a Ford plant in Louisville today and spoke once again of an America under siege: beset by unfair foreign competition and misled by politicians attached to the status quo.</p>
        <p>Representative Richard A. Gephardt stood in the rain outside a Ford plant in Louisville today and spoke once again of an America under siege: beset by unfair foreign competition and misled by politicians attached to the status quo.</p>
        <p>His talk was quick and to the point, and then he moved on.</p>
        <p>In the final days before the Democratic primaries and caucuses next Tuesday in 20 states and a territory, Mr. Gephardt's campaign is carrying a potent message of nationalism and economic anxiety throughout the South, from the oil towns of Texas and Louisiana to the textile communities of the Carolinas.</p>
        <p>Some Southern politicians say the Gephardt campaign has potential in many Southern communities where there is a sense of economic loss. 'It's Us Versus Them'</p>
        <p>''His message will sell in this state,'' said Al LaPierre, executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party. Regardless of the debate over the details of Mr. Gephardt's trade policy, Mr. LaPierre said, ''what they do grasp essentially is it's us versus them.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Gephardt travels throughout the South, giving speech after speech with no lessening of passion, he paints a pained image of a nation in decline.</p>
        <p>On the steps of the South Carolina Capitol this week, he talked of a nation dependent on the ''central bankers'' of Japan and Europe to ''keep us afloat economically.''</p>
        <p>He talked of workers losing their jobs and their way of life while editorial writers described the trade deficit as ''just a fact of life.'' And he spoke of a farm policy influenced by the giants of agribusiness rather than farmers. At stake, Mr. Gephardt concluded, is regaining control of ''our economic destiny.''</p>
        <p>Gephardt strategists assert that one of the surest signs of their success came this week, when Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee began to emphasize his commitment to working people. ''If Gore wins, it'll be another stunning win for the Gephardt message,'' said Joe Trippi, Mr. Gephardt's deputy campaign manager.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the campaign of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts took aim today at Mr. Gephardt's populist image in a new television advertisement to be broadcast throughout the South. ''Dick Gephardt tells us it's your fight too,'' an announcer says, referring to the slogan of the Gephardt campaign. ''He talks about standing up to and protecting us from the big money power brokers. Here they are'':</p>
        <p>As a list of corporate political action committees rolls down the screen, the announcer says, ''But this isn't just a list of big establishment power brokers. It's a list of Congressman Dick Gephardt's biggest contributors.'' The advertisement concludes, ''Kinda makes you wonder - is Dick Gephardt really fighting your fight, or theirs?''</p>
        <p>The issue of political action committees is the political downside of Mr. Gephardt's message; his rivals have repeatedly sought to challenge his consistency to the outsider views he espouses. They have tried to portray him as a Washington insider who has tailored his views for political gain. Candidate Dismisses Charges</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Gephardt said he had often supported legislation that caused great pain to his contributors, and did not believe such charges would hurt him with the electorate. ''I don't know who's given me money'' in many cases, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt moves easily between the fire of the campaign trail and the cooler circuits of the fund-raising world. At a fund-raising event Tuesday night in a Rockville, Md., town house, before an affluent audience that included many Republicans, Mr. Gephardt delivered a version of his standard stump speech about standing up for American farmers and workers.</p>
        <p>But he also gave his definition of the ''establishment'' for his audience: ''A loose term for academics, editorial writers and some who have a vested economic interest in not changing some of these problems, who believe you have to accommodate decline.''</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, much of the campaign's attention has been focused on fund raising; since the New Hampshire primary, $1.2 million to $1.3 million has been raised, according to William Carrick, Mr. Gephardt's campaign manager. Campaign officials said the money was instantly pumped into television time for the 14 primaries to be held next Tuesday in Southern and border states. Southern Strategy Outlined</p>
        <p>The Gephardt strategy in the South counts on strong support in such oil-producing states as Texas and Louisiana, where Mr. Gephardt's advocacy of an oil import fee is expected to help.</p>
        <p>The campaign is also hoping for a strong showing in the manufacturing and farming regions in Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, where his call for tougher trading sanctions and his general economic message is expected to hold up well.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gephardt hopes to cut into Mr. Dukakis's strength in South Florida with the support of Representative Claude Pepper, who is particularly popular among retired people there.</p>
        <p>The Gephardt campaign throughout the South has a strong edge of nationalism to it. In a debate earlier this week, after Mr. Dukakis expressed concern over the effect of an oil import fee on the economy of Mexico, Mr. Gephardt asked, ''Are you running for President of Mexico or America?''</p>
        <p>With that edge, and with the historic responsiveness of the South to populist appeals, Gephardt strategists say they are bullish about their prospects next Tuesday.</p>
