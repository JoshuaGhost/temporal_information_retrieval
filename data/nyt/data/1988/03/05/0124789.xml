        <p>Fred Smith, a 6-foot-9-inch senior, snatched the rebound of a teammate's shot and scored a game-winning lay-in with 2 seconds left in overtime yesterday to give Newtown a 56-55 victory over Springfield Gardens in a Public Schools Athletic League quarterfinal playoff game at John Bowne High School in Flushing, Queens. It was Newtown's 25th consecutive victory of the season and gave the team a berth in the semifinals March 13 at Brandeis. Springfield Gardens, the defending P.S.A.L. champion, finished with a 20-5 record. The victory made Newtown the Queens borough champion.</p>
        <p>Omar Lee, Newtown's 5-10 senior guard, scored a game-high 18 points.</p>
        <p>Newtown will face the winner of today's quarterfinal and Brooklyn borough championship between Grady (18-6) and Lincoln (22-0), at Canarsie at 1 P.M.</p>
        <p>Adlai Stevenson and Walton, two teams from the Bronx, will play in the other semifinal game. Stevenson defeated Manhattan Center, 67-49, and Walton eliminated Lehman, 61-53, in other quarterfinal games yesterday.</p>
