        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jonathan Phillips writes about the possible harmful effects of the paints used by Rubens, Renoir, Dufy and Klee, as reported in the British medical journal Lancet (letter, July 15). As Mr. Phillips rightly points out, the materials used by these artists were as different as their work. However, the inclusion of Rubens in this group is interesting because he died 200 years before any of the others were born, and their total life span was only 112 years.</p>
        <p>My late uncle, Sir Francis Cook, a distinguished painter, connoisseur and collector, had a lifelong interest in the medium used by Rubens. Both he and other scholars noted that, unlike the work of his contemporaries, no Rubens has been known to crack. Though Rubens certainly employed many assistants, his own output was prodigious, which suggests that he was able to work extremely quickly with his medium. In his oil sketches, the brushwork clearly indicates that he was able to spread his paint very freely and easily.</p>
        <p>Sir Francis concluded that Rubens used a suspension of pigments in a sort of gelatinous substance of far lower viscosity than conventional oil paint - the ''lost formula.'' After many years of research, Sir Francis developed his ''Rubens Jelly.'' This enabled him to spread his paint very quickly, and the results have a greater luminosity than is usual, a Rubens characteristic. Will any of these crack? Only time will tell.</p>
        <p>Alas the secret of whatever snake juice Sir Francis discovered or rediscovered went to the grave with him. Shortly before he died I saw several jars of the substance in a closet in his former studio. The door was usually kept locked and marked ''Poison -Keep Out.'' Sir Francis was highly active to the end and never suffered from arthritis, so perhaps too many Novembers in 17th-century England could account for Rubens's complaint.  D. ALISTAIR CAMERON-CLARKE  Princeton, N.J., July 30, 1988</p>
        <p>The writer is an art historian.</p>
