        <p>LEAD: A series of about 10 underground explosions ripped through this seacoast city today. Two houses were damaged and 200 people were forced to evacuate their homes and businesses, but no one was injured. Fire Chief Barry McKay said the explosions had apparently been caused by gasoline in the sewer system, a result of a petroleum distribution yard's effort to remove a gasoline tank.</p>
