        <p>DEEP within Manhattan's ''photo district,'' a commercial casting session is about to take place for a product so secret that the advertising agency demands anonymity. The would-be models are apprehensive; some are even crying. But Jade Albert, the photographer, is ready. Lights, camera, toddle!</p>
        <p>One by one, from a foyer full of incipient Paulina Porizkovas, come a series of writhing, whining, playing, poking, 20-month-olds.</p>
        <p>''Hands up! Whee!'' exclaims Ms. Albert, who is 434 months old, to the first child, Miranda. The advertisement requires a photograph of a baby with arms extended high overhead.</p>
        <p>''Miranda,'' asks Ms. Albert, ''can you stretch?'' Today Miranda can only cry. ''Okay, next!'' Ms. Albert shouts to her baby handler.</p>
        <p>In recent years marketers have tried to appeal to a new generation of parents whose income is as disposable as the diapers they buy. Ms. Albert has profited from advertising's baby boom, gaining a reputation as one of the nation's leading commercial children's photographers. Last year American Photographer magazine credited her with reinventing the craft by allowing children to act as they do in real life.</p>
        <p>The problem is that in real life not too many babies like to stand still with their arms over their heads.</p>
        <p>''Hello, Jacqueline, can you stand right here?'' Ms. Albert asks a blond lass, pointing to a piece of white tape on the floor.</p>
        <p>Jacqueline sits on the tape. ''She gets an orange sticker,'' Ms. Albert says to her casting assistant, who, in keeping with the spirit of the affair, happens to be her own mother, Peggy Barnett. The stickers, which are placed on each model's spec sheet along with vital information like name, height and nap time, connote modeling potential. Orange means so-so. Green is Vogue material, give or take 18 years.</p>
        <p>But green stickers are few and far between this afternoon, prompting Ms. Albert to revise her tactics: ''So big!'' gives way to ''Do your exercises!'' which is replaced by ''I'm gonna get ya!'' and ''Where's the sky?!''</p>
        <p>Eventually a combination of approaches and a concerted emphasis on ''Simon says'' produces five children with green stickers. All return the next day for the shoot. Most fall short of perfection.</p>
        <p>Suddenly a cry is heard: ''George is here! George is here!''</p>
        <p>''He's Jade's favorite,'' explains Ms. Barnett, noting that George was the subject in Ms. Albert's shoots for Hasbro and Playtex. ''He's so cute, and he does what he's told.''</p>
        <p>Like Casey swaggering to the plate, a tiny dimpled boy with a bowl of blond hair enters the studio. As his mother changes his clothing, George looks in the dressing room mirror and kisses his reflection. ''He's a real pro,'' Ms. Albert says.</p>
        <p>One of her assistants turns on a cassette tape. Victor Herbert's ''Toyland'' begins playing, followed by ''Pop Goes the Weasel.'' George enters the set and immediately starts dancing. Ms. Albert calls for lights out.</p>
        <p>''Reach for the sky!'' Ms. Albert says. ''So big!'' But George flaps his arms instead of stretching them. She instructs an assistant to play ''Happy Birthday'' and holds a lighter to George's lips so he can blow out the ersatz candle. ''Happy birthday, George!'' she says. ''Aaaaah, boo!''</p>
        <p>But George has had enough. ''Night, night,'' he says, lying down. Nothing - not his Mom, not Ms. Albert, not a rubber duckie she keeps for such occasions - will rouse him.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Ms. Albert winds up with several good shots of a young lady named Mary Elizabeth. The toll, as usual, has been high: frayed nerves and exhaustion. But something keeps her going.</p>
        <p>''Once I did an adult campaign for Leggs,'' she says, as she prepares for the next day's session. ''That was refreshing, but after a few days of it I missed the kids.''</p>
