        <p>LEAD: Four Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank today as clashes broke out at the funeral of a fifth man who died of shooting wounds sustained last month.</p>
        <p>Four Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank today as clashes broke out at the funeral of a fifth man who died of shooting wounds sustained last month.</p>
        <p>The one-day death toll was the highest since last April and one of the highest since the uprising began just over a year ago. The deaths bring to at least 293 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis since the uprising began. In addition, 9 Israeli civilians and 3 soldiers have been killed.</p>
        <p>The new clashes, in the city of Nablus, came on the day the United States opened talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization - an event that many Palestinians had suggested might bring calm to the occupied territories.</p>
        <p>At least 42 Palestinians were wounded, two of them critically, when the army opened fire on stone-throwing demonstrators who gathered for the funeral of Ashraf Haj Daoud, 16 years old, who died in a Jerusalem hospital early this morning. He was shot in demonstrations on Nov. 25. Nablus Under Curfew</p>
        <p>The army confirmed the shootings, saying Palestinians had begun pelting soldiers with rocks. Troops opened fire with plastic bullets, said doctors who treated the victims. Later, soldiers placed Nablus under a curfew, confining all residents to their homes.</p>
        <p>Palestinians also said three Arabs were shot and wounded, two seriously, at demonstrations in the Gaza Strip today.</p>
        <p>A diverse array of Palestinians had predicted that violence in the territories would subside, at least for a while, as a show of support for Yasir Arafat, the P.L.O. chairman, who on Wednesday obtained American agreement to open a dialogue.</p>
        <p>Many Israelis said they were skeptical of the Palestinian prediction.</p>
        <p>Today Foreign Minister Shimon Peres wrote a letter to Secretary of State George P. Shultz that said: ''I remain convinced that the American decision was - at best - premature.''</p>
        <p>In an interview today, Mr. Peres said he believed that the United States would soon learn that Mr. Arafat's renunciation of terrorism would not stop violence in the occupied territories or guerrilla attacks from other countries. But American officials have told Israel that they do not intend to hold Mr. Arafat accountable for every rock or firebomb thrown in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres said he would be willing to talk to ''any Palestinian'' who had truly given up terrorism and accepted Israel - presumably including Mr. Arafat. Peres Proposes Elections</p>
        <p>While Mr. Peres said he objected to the United States' talks with the P.L.O., at least for now, he also said ''we can't just stand up to the rest of the world and not come up with a reasonable alternative.''</p>
        <p>He proposes elections in the West Bank and Gaza so that Palestinians can pick representatives with whom Israel can negotiate. Once representatives are chosen, he said, ''we shall sit down and talk sense.''</p>
        <p>In an interview Thursday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was cool to the suggestion of elections in the territories, though he did not reject the idea outright.</p>
        <p>At first glance, it might seem as if Mr. Peres will have a difficult time promoting his elections idea or other peace proposals because in the next Government he has decided he will be the Finance Minister. But with no equivocation, he said he intended to continue promoting foreign policy initiatives regardless. 'Not Going to Resign'</p>
        <p>''One hundred percent,'' he said. ''I'm not going to resign. I'm not going to abandon my responsibility as leader of the Labor Party.''</p>
        <p>In the coalition agreement under negotiation now, both Mr. Peres and Mr. Shamir said, ministers from either the Labor or Likud parties would be free to pursue whatever peace proposals interest them, without consulting the other party.</p>
        <p>''Anyone has the right to propose any initiative for peace,'' Mr. Peres said. Only when the proposal grows firm would it have to be submitted to the Cabinet, half of whose ministers would be from Labor and half from Likud, giving both parties veto power over the other's activities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peres agreed that the arrangement could turn out to be a recipe for creativity - or chaos.</p>
        <p>He said he was not happy with the prospect of joining this coalition government but felt a responsibility to do so and would not be reluctant to work for peace himself. Refers to Arafat</p>
        <p>Of Mr. Arafat's recent remarks, he said: ''The Palestinians want a land of their own. I'm against it. But I don't consider it a crime. How can I, being a fair-minded man?''</p>
        <p>He said he thought the United States should have withheld its decision to talk to Mr. Arafat until after the P.L.O. had actually shown that terrorism had been stopped for a period of time. For the P.L.O., he said, promises are not enough.</p>
        <p>In the violence today, Palestinians and hospital officials said Yasin Adel, 19, died from a bullet wound to the neck. Fayez Shugo, 20, died from a shot through the heart. Iyad Abu Himal, 20, died from wounds to the mouth and chest. And Nidal Shafiq Wazani, 26, died from a wound to the neck.</p>
