        <p>LEAD: HOLIDAY desserts that can be prepared in advance are a boon to the host or hostess. Most desserts made with caramel fall into this category. If they have to be molded, they must be allowed to set and are often best chilled overnight.</p>
        <p>HOLIDAY desserts that can be prepared in advance are a boon to the host or hostess. Most desserts made with caramel fall into this category. If they have to be molded, they must be allowed to set and are often best chilled overnight.</p>
        <p>Making caramel is simple. Sugar dissolved in a little water is cooked until the temperature reaches about 350 degrees and turns a rich brown color. This caramel syrup is used for coating baking dishes or molds or sweetening custards or ice cream mixtures while it is still syrupy. It hardens as it cools.</p>
        <p>Maida Heatter, the author of many baking books, recommends using a nonstick pan for making the caramel. All the caramel slides out of the pan and the pan itself is easy to clean.</p>
        <p>The mold to be lined with caramel should not be non-stick, however. It should not even be greased because the caramel will not adhere and coat it evenly.</p>
        <p>Two of the pudding recipes that follow call for coating molds with caramel. The third, for a cornmeal pudding, uses the caramel as a sweetener. This pudding is baked in a greased mold.</p>
        <p>Because sugar is so hot when it caramelizes it will bubble up if mixed with cooler ingredients. This mixing should be done gradually, in a deep pan. One final caution: never taste caramel in its liquid state because it will be hot enough to burn you. To remove caramel from cooking utensils simply soak them in water.  Holiday Bread Pudding  Preparation time: 30 minutes plus overnight chilling  Cooking time: 1 hour 15 minutes</p>
        <p>1/4 cup dark rum</p>
        <p>1/2 cup finely chopped candied fruit</p>
        <p>3/4 cup sugar  2 tablespoons water  10 slices good-quality stale white sandwich bread  1 1/2 cups milk</p>
        <p>1/2 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>1/4 cup pine nuts  3 egg yolks  2 egg whites.</p>
        <p>1. Warm the rum in a small saucepan, add the candied fruit and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Place one-half cup of the sugar with the water in a heavy saucepan or skillet, preferably one with a nonstick lining. Place over medium-high heat, bring to a boil and allow to cook until it turns a rich amber color. Immediately pour this caramel into a four-cup metal loaf pan that does not have a nonstick lining and tilt the pan so the bottom and sides become coated with caramel. Keep tilting the pan as the caramel cools so the coating is even.  3. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  4. Cube the bread and place it in a bowl. Scald the milk and cream and pour over the bread. Stir. Fold in the candied fruit and rum and the pine nuts. Add the remaining sugar. Lightly beat the egg yolks and stir them in.</p>
        <p>5. Beat the egg whites until stiff. Fold into the bread pudding. Spoon the pudding into the caramel-lined pan. Place in the oven and bake for one hour.</p>
        <p>6. Allow to cool to room temperature and refrigerate overnight.</p>
        <p>7. Run a knife around the edges, unmold onto a platter and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.  Caramel Cornmeal Pudding  Preparation time: 30 minutes  Cooking time: 2 hours  4Z cups milk</p>
        <p>1/2 cup yellow cornmeal  1 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup water  2 tablespoons sweet butter  2 tablespoons cognac  2 eggs, lightly beaten  1 cup finely chopped pecans  Pinch of salt  Pinch of nutmeg  Softly whipped cream of vanilla ice cream.</p>
        <p>1. Scald four cups of milk in a deep three- or four-quart saucepan. Gradually add the cornmeal, stirring constantly. Continue cooking five to 10 minutes until the mixture has thickened somewhat.</p>
        <p>2. While the cornmeal and milk are cooking dissolve the sugar in the water in a heavy saucepan, preferably nonstick, and cook over medium-high heat until the mixture turns a rich amber color. Very slowly stir the hot caramel into the hot cornmeal mixture. Continue cooking until the caramel is evenly dissolved in the cornmeal.</p>
        <p>3. Remove from heat and add the butter, eggs, cognac, pecans, salt and nutmeg.</p>
        <p>4. Now preheat the oven to 325 degrees.</p>
        <p>5. Butter an eight-cup casserole dish. Pour the cornmeal mixture into the dish, place in the oven and bake 30 minutes. Stir in the remaining milk and bake one hour and 15 minutes to one-and-a-half hours longer. Serve warm or chilled with whipped cream or ice cream.</p>
        <p>Yield: 8 to 10 servings.  Brandied Caramel Custard  Preparation time: 20 minutes  Cooking time: 40 minutes  1 cup sugar  3 tablespoons water  3 eggs  2 egg yolks</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon nutmeg</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
        <p>1/4 cup brandy or cognac  2 1/2 cups milk</p>
        <p>1/2 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>1/4 cup golden raisins.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees</p>
        <p>2. Mix one-half cup of sugar with the water in a heavy saucepan, preferably nonstick. Cook over medium-high heat until the sugar has dissolved and turns a rich amber color. Pour the caramel into the bottom of a four- to five-cup baking dish, tilting the dish so the caramel coats the bottom evenly.</p>
        <p>3. Beat the eggs and egg yolks together. Beat in the remaining onehalf-cup sugar, the nutmeg and cardamom. Stir in three tablespoons of the brandy, the milk and cream. Pour the mixture into the baking dish, place in the oven and bake 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>4. While the custard is baking, mix the remaining tablespoon of brandy with the raisins. After the custard has baked for 20 to 25 minutes, scatter the brandied raisins over the top of the custard. They will sink in.</p>
        <p>5. Continue baking the custard 15 to 20 minutes longer, until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.</p>
        <p>6. Allow the custard to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate at least six hours or overnight. To unmold, run a knife around the edges and unmold onto a plate that has a rim to catch the caramel syrup.</p>
