        <p>Barbara Krakauer, a violinist, and Nancy Garniez, a pianist, are members of the Alaria Chamber Ensemble and also perform together as a duo. On Monday evening they made their joint New York debut at Town Hall, offering an inventive program devoted mostly to 20th-century music.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Krakauer is an assured and unassuming player who made the strongest impression in slow, gently introspective music: specifically, in the glowing second movement of a Hindemith Sonata (Op. 11, No. 2), the Lullaby in Britten's Suite (Op. 6) and the Adagio Espressivo of a Beethoven Sonata (Op. 96). In these movements her sound had a warm glow that conveyed a sense of inner serenity.</p>
        <p>In faster, brighter movements, Mrs. Krakauer was always accurate, if a little restrained, and in these Ms. Garniez supplied the real propulsion. On her own, Ms. Garniez played Ursula Mamlok's Three Bagatelles, a set of pointillistic vignettes. And Mrs. Krakauer gave a meditative, graceful account of Ms. Mamlok's ''From My Garden,'' for solo violin.</p>
