        <p>When midnight has struck and you've rung in the new year it is nice to sit down to a festive snack with your champagne - something to line the stomach before you go to bed. One of my favorite dishes is blinis with caviar. You can make the batter in advance, and all you have to do at the last minute is saute the pancakes. If you have a couple of small frying pans this can be accomplished quickly and easily, particularly if you have someone to help you. Either black or salmon caviar, which is red and much cheaper, can be used on the blinis.</p>
        <p>Black caviar is good on top of lightly scrambled eggs served in brioches. Unless you have plenty of time on your hands, you probably won't want to start making brioche on New Year's Eve. Instead, use store-bought (they can be frozen successfully) and heat them up while you are cooking the eggs. It is important that the eggs be gently scrambled so that they are creamy and not dried-out.</p>
        <p>White truffles, a food that ranks with caviar as one of the great treats, are now in season. Share them only with people who love them, for they are very expensive. They come from Italy where they grow near the roots of trees in Tuscany, Romagna and Piedmont and are usually sold nested in a cupful of raw rice. Save this for risotto.</p>
        <p>Do not keep the truffles for more than a couple of days after you buy them because they spoil very easily. Slice the truffle directly onto the pasta at the table using a truffle or cheese slicer.</p>
        <p>Of course, you don't have to wait until midnight to serve these dishes. They make a good early supper or first course for dinner. Or, if you prefer, you can have them on New Year's Day for lunch. I can't think of a better way to bring in the new year.  Fettuccine With White Truffles  Preparation time: 5 minutes  Cooking time: 5 to 10 minutes  4 quarts cold water  Coarse salt  12 ounces fettuccine  3 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 to 3/4 cup heavy cream</p>
        <p>Freshly ground pepper to taste  2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese  1 small white truffle (about Z of an ounce).</p>
        <p>1. Bring salted water to a rolling boil and cook the fettuccine until al dente. Drain.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, put the butter and cream into a saucepan and heat through. Add the pasta and toss. Season with salt, pepper and cheese.</p>
        <p>3. Place the pasta on heated individual plates and grate some truffle on each serving. Pass more Parmesan cheese separately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 small servings.  Brioche With Caviar And Scrambled Eggs  Preparation time: 5 minutes  Cooking time: 10 minutes  6 brioches  8 eggs  Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  4 tablespoons unsalted butter  4 ounces caviar.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and heat the brioches. Meanwhile, prepare the eggs.</p>
        <p>2 Beat the eggs with the salt and pepper. Add half the butter, cut in little pieces.</p>
        <p>3. Melt the rest of the butter in a saucepan and then cook the eggs, but very slowly until they are soft but not dry.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, remove the brioches from the oven, cut off the tops and scoop out the insides. Keep the brioches warm.</p>
        <p>5. Fill the brioches with the egg mixture and top with caviar. Place the lids at an angle on the side.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.  Russian Blinis With Caviar  Preparation time: 10 minutes, 2 hours unattended  Cooking time: 20 minutes  1 1/2 cups milk  1 package granular yeast  1 1/2 cups unbleached white flour</p>
        <p>1/2 cup buckwheat flour</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt  1 teaspoon sugar  4 eggs, separated</p>
        <p>1/4 pound unsalted butter, melted  6 ounces red caviar  2 cups sour cream.</p>
        <p>1. Scald the milk and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Dissolve the yeast in one-fourth cup warm water.</p>
        <p>3. Sift the white flour into a bowl, add the buckwheat flour, salt and sugar.</p>
        <p>4. Beat the egg yolks until thick. When the milk has cooled to lukewarm, add the yolks and three tablespoons of the melted butter. Add the yeast. Mix well and pour into the flour. Mix thoroughly, removing any lumps. Set aside in a warm place lightly covered with a towel for about two hours, or until doubled in bulk.</p>
        <p>5. Whip the egg whites until they stand in stiff peaks and fold them into the batter.</p>
        <p>6. Lightly butter a small frying pan. Pour in just enough of the pancake mixture to coat the bottom of the pan. When the mixture begins to bubble, turn the pancake over and cook lightly on the other side. Wrap the pancakes in a napkin and keep them warm in the oven while you cook the others. Serve in a pile, wrapped in a napkin.</p>
        <p>7. Serve the caviar, the sour cream and the remaining melted butter in small bowls on the table. Each person puts a pancake on a plate, butters it, adds sour cream and caviar, and rolls it like a crepe.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
