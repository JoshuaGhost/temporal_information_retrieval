        <p>LEAD: The Soviet Union and the Afghan guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan ended the first round of high-level meetings in the Saudi resort Taif today with expressions of satisfaction but no announcement of results, reports reaching here said.</p>
        <p>The Soviet Union and the Afghan guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan ended the first round of high-level meetings in the Saudi resort Taif today with expressions of satisfaction but no announcement of results, reports reaching here said.</p>
        <p>The meetings, which began Saturday under great secrecy, are to continue, the reports said. But no time or place were announced.</p>
        <p>The meetings were the first official talks between the Soviets and the Afghan guerrillas since Soviet forces swept into Afghanistan in December 1979. First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli M. Vorontsov, who is also the Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan, faced a guerrilla delegation headed by Burhanuddin Rabbani, chairman of the seven-party coalition based in Peshawar, Pakistan.</p>
        <p>The Soviet negotiator is seeking agreement from the political leadership of the guerrilla movements on the basis of a compromise political arrangement that would take effect before the Feb. 15 deadline for the withdrawal of the remaining Soviet troops. Troop Pullout Deadline</p>
        <p>In adherence to the Geneva agreement of April, about half of the Soviet forces were withdrawn by Aug. 15. Moscow suspended the withdrawal last month, asserting that the two other signers of the accords, Pakistan and the United States, have been violating it by continued military support to the guerrillas.</p>
        <p>But Soviet generals and diplomats here have indicated to Western diplomats and journalists that Moscow intends to meet the Feb. 15 deadline. At the same time, they have indicated a conviction that the groundwork for a political settlement must be laid before. They have been at pains to leave some uncertainty over whether such an arrangement is a prerequisite for completion of the troop pullout.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Western diplomats here, who profess to have little hard information, express a belief that for the sake of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's larger objectives in the West and China, the deadline will be observed.</p>
        <p>Those diplomats say they see in the talks in Saudi Arabia a strong signal of Soviet eagerness for an agreement with their foes and a serious weakening of the Soviet-imposed Afghan Government of President Najibullah. Kabul Regime Excluded</p>
        <p>The Kabul Government has been excluded from the meetings, presumably because the Soviet Union has bowed to the guerrilla coalition's refusal to talk with any representatives of the Najibullah regime.</p>
        <p>Diplomats noted that the Soviet Union made a major concession in agreeing to meet in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Government is a strong supporter and major supplier of arms and money to the Islamic guerrillas.</p>
        <p>Because of its abhorrence of Communism, Saudi Arabia has never opened diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union or any other Communist power. Over the last year, however, some contacts have taken place, and the Saudi Foreign Minister has visited Moscow.</p>
        <p>The conclusion that diplomats here draw from those Soviet concessions and from Moscow's apparent disregard for the prestige of the Kabul Government is that the Soviet Union is mounting a determined effort to preserve its own international image in the final act of its Afghan intervention.</p>
        <p>A European diplomat who met with Mr. Vorontsov shortly after the Soviet envoy arrived here last October said that Mr. Vorontsov had declared that Moscow could not leave behind a government that would immediately collapse after the Soviet Union withdrew its troops.  Rebels Kill 42 in Bus Attack</p>
        <p>MOSCOW, Dec. 5 (Reuters) -Rebels opened fire on a passenger bus near the northern Afghan city of Kunduz, killing 42 people, the Soviet press agency Tass reported today.</p>
        <p>The attack occurred Wednesday, when the rebels stopped a bus traveling from the Afghan district of Imam Sakhib to Kunduz, Tass said in a report from Kabul.</p>
        <p>Tass said the residents of Kunduz held a rally to denounce the attack and ''the leaders of anti-Government groups for refusing to stop the war against their own people.''</p>
