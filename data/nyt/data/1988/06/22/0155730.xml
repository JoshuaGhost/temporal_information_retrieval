        <p>LEAD: Despite, or because of, his long association with public television, beginning with a WNET contract in the early 1970's, Frederick Wiseman is an outspoken critic of the system. In testimony before a Senate communications subcommittee this year, he accused the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of, among other things, being unprofessional and often using panel processes that virtually guarantee mediocre programming.</p>
        <p>Despite, or because of, his long association with public television, beginning with a WNET contract in the early 1970's, Frederick Wiseman is an outspoken critic of the system. In testimony before a Senate communications subcommittee this year, he accused the Corporation for Public Broadcasting of, among other things, being unprofessional and often using panel processes that virtually guarantee mediocre programming. ''Personal politics, the buddy system, jealousy and pop ideology dominate the panel deliberations,'' Mr. Wiseman maintained.</p>
        <p>The point here is that Mr. Wiseman is passionately dedicated to his work and is no pushover for those who might impede him. There is an unquestioned integrity about the man and his films. Public television's feelings may be bruised, but the system winds up carrying Mr. Wiseman's latest nine-hour-plus opus. ''Deaf and Blind,'' a project that began in 1984 at the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind, consists of four parts, each running over two hours. They are being shown on Channel 13 over four consecutive evenings. ''Blind'' was broadcast last night. ''Deaf'' is being offered at 10 tonight.</p>
        <p>The basic Wiseman techniques have changed hardly at all over the years. The subjects are institutions: a high school, a hospital, a welfare center, a race track and a monastery, among them. Using no narration, the films wander about their settings, picking up representative details and listening in on conversations and conferences. Viewers are not told about these places; they are taken there and made privy to their inner workings and dynamics. Inevitably, reactions vary dramatically. For some, the excursions, lacking the standard guideposts of familiar news documentaries, can be exasperating. For others, including this writer, the cumulative experience is nearly always memorable.</p>
        <p>It's not as though Mr. Wiseman cannot seem almost perversely challenging at times. There are long scenes in ''Deaf and Blind'' that are just about incomprehensible, as students communicate with one another through sign language or a combination of signing and inarticulate sounds. And there are drawn-out scenes with multi-impaired youngsters that can be truly painful to watch. There is occasionally the suspicion that the film maker is trying to saddle his audience with guilt, making a holier-than-thou accusation that if you can't take it, there is something lacking in you. But then again, no one has ever accused Mr. Wiseman of being easy or mindlessly comforting.</p>
        <p>In ''Deaf and Blind,'' he has composed an extraordinary document that opens up worlds far removed from the prime-time television universe of eternally happy and healthy faces beaming radiantly while consuming soft drinks and burgers. The Alabama Institute, which has five campuses in Talledega, has 1,300 students, all deaf or blind or both. Some are retarded and will need help all their lives. Many, however, will learn a vocation that will let them live independently. The staff of 600 teachers and administrators includes disabled people.</p>
        <p>On the surface, this is a special and very different world. But Mr. Wiseman is constantly discovering how ''normal'' it is. The ''Deaf'' segment tonight has an extended scene in which a boy, after threatening to commit suicide, is called to a conference with his mother, a counselor and the school director. The conversation goes round and round, gradually touching on everything from divorce and demanding children to frustrated parents and concerned outsiders. It's a scene that could take place at any school across the nation. But in this instance, the student is deaf.</p>
        <p>And so the series goes, focusing on vocational training in ''Adjustment and Work'' tomorrow and on more difficult situations in ''Multi-Handicapped'' on Friday. Small triumphs are recorded in learning how to make change in coins or how to fold a washcloth. Passing faces are allowed to become familiar. The interracial harmony of the school is a model for all institutions. And the devotion and skills of the staff are positively inspiring.</p>
        <p>If a time capsule were prepared today for opening in a couple of hundred years, ''Deaf and Blind'' would be an ideal choice for inclusion. There's no doubt that a society is reflected in its institutions. The Alabama Institute catches us at our most caring and compassionate moments.</p>
