        <p>LEAD: An Arab summit meeting ended today with a broad resolution supporting the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and pledging ''all necessary help and assistance in all necessary forms'' to insure that the upheaval continues.</p>
        <p>An Arab summit meeting ended today with a broad resolution supporting the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and pledging ''all necessary help and assistance in all necessary forms'' to insure that the upheaval continues.</p>
        <p>But the Arab leaders did not extend specific monetary commitments, leaving the matter to be negotiated between individual Arab countries and the Palestine Liberation Organization.</p>
        <p>The P.L.O. came to the meeting here requesting $300 million to $400 million in new aid under P.L.O. control to support the uprising. The funds would be used in part to support Palestinians who have gone on strike or been otherwise idled by the protests.</p>
        <p>Although the Arab leaders described the P.L.O. as ''the leadership of the Palestine people,'' they refrained from giving the P.L.O. sole responsibility for managing aid to the Palestinians, treating the organization as one of several channels for the flow of funds.</p>
        <p>Arab officials here said a committee of the P.L.O., Algeria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Qatar and Bahrain would make political decisions and manage international efforts to support the uprising.</p>
        <p>The P.L.O. had demanded that all aid be channeled through the organization or its affiliated agencies. The new arrangement appears to be similar to the present structure, in which the P.L.O., Jordan, Syria and Arab financial institutions all play a role in the effort to support the uprising. No Flat Rejection of Shultz Effort</p>
        <p>The summit's final resolution was careful not to close the door in the face of the Middle East peace initiative undertaken by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.</p>
        <p>The Arab leaders limited themselves to criticizing ''slow and ineffective'' peace efforts and chiding the United States for ''encouraging Israel to continue its aggression and violations of human rights'' of the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
        <p>The Arab leaders reiterated their view that peace in the Middle East can be achieved only through an international conference under United Nations auspices and with the P.L.O. as ''the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.''</p>
        <p>In a departure from the agenda that was supposed to concern itself only with the Palestinian issue, the Arab leaders also affirmed their strong condemnation of what they said was Iranian aggression in the Iraq-Iran war, reiterating a similar resolution approved in November at an Arab summit meeting in Jordan.</p>
        <p>The final communique said all members of the Arab League were in ''total solidarity with Iraq and its defense of its national territories and solidarity.''</p>
        <p>Syria, an ally of Iran, did not raise any objection to the rough anti-Iranian language, Arab officials said.</p>
