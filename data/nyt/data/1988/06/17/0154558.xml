        <p>LEAD: According to concerned psychologists, the leading causes of nervous breakdowns are the death of a loved one, value-added taxes and outfitting your child for overnight camp.</p>
        <p>According to concerned psychologists, the leading causes of nervous breakdowns are the death of a loved one, value-added taxes and outfitting your child for overnight camp.</p>
        <p>Linda Bergman has learned to pace herself. She's a one-stop shopper. She always goes to Carl's outfitters, where they do everything from sticking on name tags to packing the trunk. She allots two days per child. ''You figure you'll be done in two hours,'' she said. ''No way! You gear yourself up for it. You sit there pointing, 'Not this color, not this size, not this design, not this designer; no, you can't have seven of those!' Before you know it, you've spent a million dollars.''</p>
        <p>It's not unusual for parents at Carl's to spend $1,200 per camper. And that's not the worst of it. Last year, young Jason Bergman arrived at camp with so many things he couldn't stuff them all into his bunk cubbyhole. Jason had to rent extra cubbyhole space from another camper, Mrs. Bergman said.</p>
        <p>For 12 years Jay Berg has run the camp department at Carl's and there is nothing he has not seen. One year he had a camper so tired of trying on clothes, the distraught youth locked himself into a dressing room and refused to come out. In rush cases, Mr. Berg has filled out the name tags as the mother bought each item.</p>
        <p>The other day, Liz Jarushewsky began outfitting her three children, all first-time campers. She started with the oldest, Dovid, 11. ''You need underwear and socks?'' said the salesman, Michael Schor.</p>
        <p>''Everything from head to toe,'' said Ms. Jarushewsky, checking her camp list.</p>
        <p>''He needs 14 underwear.''</p>
        <p>''They come three in a pack, take five,'' Mr. Schor said. ''Socks?''</p>
        <p>''Fourteen pair,'' said the mother. Mr. Schor, an old camper himself, looked stunned. ''You need 24 pairs; you normally use two pair a day,'' he said. ''People think 24 pairs is excessive; then they come in July and say, 'My kid needs socks!' '' She took the 24. ''All in plain white,'' Mr. Schor said. ''You don't have to worry how to match them.''</p>
        <p>''Shorts?'' Mr. Schor said. ''He has three pairs,'' the mother said. ''Three!'' Mr. Schor said. ''He'll need six, at least. I have gym shorts, walking shorts; I have these shorts, $7, which are garbage. You need tennis shorts? How about some nylon shorts?'' Nearby, Brad Gross, 13, had climbed to the top of a ladder in the shoe area and was demanding that his mother buy him $90 Timberland boots. ''Please, Mom, please.'' Finally, Brad agreed to come down to try on pants. He saw a pair he liked, 36 length. ''They have to be shortened,'' said his mother, Abbie. Brad wears 31. ''This is how I wear it,'' Brad said, ''rolled up like this. The most I'll go is 35.'' ''Can Jay measure your leg?'' Mrs. Gross asked. Brad said, ''No!''</p>
        <p>''You got big since I saw you last,'' Mr. Berg said. ''I saw you yesterday,'' Brad said. Meanwhile, Mr. Schor was saying, ''Does Dovid have Totes?'' ''He can't wear his Timberlands?'' Ms. Jarushewksy said.</p>
        <p>''I guess he could,'' Mr. Schor said. ''Does he need a tennis racket?'' The salesman wheeled around with one and checked it off the list. ''Doesn't he get to try it?'' the mother asked. Dovid swung a few times and said, ''O.K. What about water guns?''</p>
        <p>''He's going to take two pairs of dungarees to camp,'' Mr. Schor said. ''Al, we need another order sheet here!''</p>
        <p>Dovid's sister Lauren looked up and said, ''Mommy, we're buying everything.'' ''This is how it is the first time,'' Mr. Schor said. ''Pillowcases?'' ''Will they fit?'' the mother asked. ''Fits all pillows,'' Mr. Schor said. ''Does he use sweatbands?'' Mr. Schor said. ''On his wrist,'' Lauren said. ''Good, let's go to jerseys,'' Mr. Schor said. ''Mesh jerseys, take two or three. Do you want tank tops?'' ''No tanks!'' the mother said. ''It gets hot, you'll want your tanks,'' Mr. Schor said. ''You're right,'' the mother said. ''It was good you remembered the tanks.'' ''No pinks, no purples,'' Dovid said. ''You got it, pal!'' Mr. Schor said. ''You've qualified for a free trunk, you know - I'll give you two.'' Mr. Schor explained, ''everything's that's name tapeable, we name tape.'' The more name tapes, the more you save. For 100 it's $4.50, for 200 it's just $7.40.</p>
        <p>Dovid's subtotal had reached $1,000 when Mr. Schor said, ''Does he need a winter coat for camp?'' ''A winter coat?'' Mrs. Jarushewsky said. Mr. Schor is a patient man. He explained how cold the nights can get in an upstate camp. Luckily there were fleece-lined denim jackets in stock. The mother watched while Dovid tried one on and then said, ''You think that's warm enough?''</p>
