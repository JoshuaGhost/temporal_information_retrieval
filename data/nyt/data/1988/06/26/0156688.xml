        <p>LEAD: LAST summer on my vacation I reread ''Remembrance of Things Past.'' On rainy days, on the beach, before going to sleep, I journeyed through dependent clauses, I swam in syntax. The trouble was that when I finished I was talking in these rhythms. Once you get into Proust, you can't get out. People began to move away from me at the beach, at cocktail parties.</p>

        <p>LEAD: LAST summer on my vacation I reread ''Remembrance of Things Past.'' On rainy days, on the beach, before going to sleep, I journeyed through dependent clauses, I swam in syntax.

        <p>LAST summer on my vacation I reread ''Remembrance of Things Past.'' On rainy days, on the beach, before going to sleep, I journeyed through dependent clauses, I swam in syntax. The trouble was that when I finished I was talking in these rhythms. Once you get into Proust, you can't get out. People began to move away from me at the beach, at cocktail parties. ''What's wrong?'' my wife said. ''Are you depressed?''</p>
        <p>This is just one of the contingencies of vacation reading, a time when you overdose on printed matter. Yet vacation, that yawning, tempting interim, is the time for heroic reading, and some people I know spend as much time deciding what books they're going to take as they do on choosing a place to go.</p>
        <p>It's different, this free and easy reading. On your vacation, when you're rested and ready for anything, you bring a remorseless, almost brutal energy to bear on books. You read them in the pitiless light of the sun and give them your undivided attention. All your pores are open, you sweat over the book, and I wonder whether this is fair. Your average book is meant to be read casually, even furtively.</p>
        <p>Perhaps vacation books should be a bit above your head, to give authors a handicap. The poor devils are subjected to all sorts of approaches. For example, I saw a nude young woman on a beach reading ''The Magic Mountain.'' It's an interesting question - not yet addressed, so far as I know, in literary criticism - how the circumstances of the reading affect the experience of the book. Can one be sunburned by a brilliant book?</p>
        <p>I've noticed a certain competitiveness, even a soupcon of conspicuous consumption. Ask anyone what they're reading and they'll say Lucretius' ''On the Nature of Things'' or Heidegger's ''Being and Time.'' I've got my own answer all ready: I've just finished ''The Fragility of Goodness'' and I'm halfway through ''Eros the Bittersweet.'' After that, I'm going to curl up with ''Tragic Ways of Killing a Woman.''</p>
        <p>Some treat reading as a sport; they read athletically. In fact, I've noticed that vacation books even enter into the body-narcissism of readers. Fiction induces a kind of squirming preen; poetry has a Parkinson effect; social science readers carry their shoulders rather high, sometimes one more than the other.</p>
        <p>The great bane of summer reading is the feeling that you've brought the wrong books. Last summer, I was obsessed with the idea that I wanted to read the complete ''Dream Songs'' of John Berryman. There are hundreds of them and I was convinced that unless I read every single one, my vacation would be wasted. Yet I hadn't brought them, so I had to read Proust on the rebound. He ain't no John Berryman, but he's O.K.</p>
        <p>I think I see a trend in Kenneth S. Brecher's ''Too Sad to Sing: A Memoir with Postcards'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich). Memoirs and novels are growing shorter as authors rely more on suggestion, compression and symbolism. Also, the epistolary novel seems to be reviving, probably because it spares the writer the tedium of transitions, dialogue and interaction.</p>
        <p>Postcards are even better than letters, because they only run to 50 words. While we all know how letters can go on, the postcard is the last refinement of minimalism. It has the discipline of a sonnet - and what a sense of place! While Mr. Brecher's memoir is only partly written on postcards - he tells as well as shows - I'm intrigued by the idea of a novel written entirely on cards. Among other things, it's a wonderful way to use the hundreds of postcards we buy and never send.</p>
        <p>Take Kafka's ''Castle,'' for example. Everyone knows it's a great book - yet why doesn't anyone finish it? A postcard version would eliminate some of Kafka's longueurs. Also, by showing, the pictures would help elucidate the symbolism, which even Kafka's admirers can't agree on. To encourage this promising movement, I've sketched out a postcard version of ''The Castle,'' in the form of a correspondence Kafka had with his fiancee Felice Bauer and his friend Max Brod when he was on holiday at a castle on the Rhine.</p>
        <p>(All of the following postcards bear the same picture of the castle, with an X marking Kafka's room.)  5 June 1922  Dear Felice,</p>
        <p>The castle is imposing, if a bit brooding. The management takes its responsibilities very seriously. The forms one is obliged to fill out on arrival amount to a life history. I was astonished to find that one must believe in God to be accepted as a guest.  7 June 1922  Dear Felice,</p>
        <p>The management continues officious. Apparently I failed my Rorschach test and I must take it again. What a bother - I had hoped to get in some tennis. Weather dark and overcast. Perhaps I am being paranoid, but it seems to me that my room smells of pineapples.  8 June 1922  Dear Max,</p>
        <p>I have mixed feelings about this place. Last night I wandered through the corridors for hours looking for the water closet. Nor can I find the tennis court. There are not one but two assistant tennis pros, but they can't find it either.  11 June 1922  Dear Felice,</p>
        <p>Having bad dreams, the effect perhaps of an alien place. Despite the pretensions of the staff, one can't get a shirt decently ironed here. And while there's a splendid view to be had, my window, owing to a peculiarity of the castle's architecture, opens on the window of my neighbor, an elderly bachelor named Blumfeld. Saw a cockroach in my room last night. Wish you were here.  13 June 1922  Dear Max,</p>
        <p>Met a sexy Village type in the taproom last night. It's a cute place, cunningly decorated with medieval torture instruments. Still can't find the tennis court. To my complaints about the service, the manager replied that if I like I can have the concierge's job myself.  13 June 1922  Dear Felice,</p>
        <p>The management here is a trial. My inquiries about the tennis court are now met with insolence. Sleeping a bit better however. May stay an additional week to study quaint local customs.  18 June 1922  Dear Max,</p>
        <p>Have decided to accept concierge job. Would you be a good fellow and break the news to Felice? You might want to take her out yourself - she's a terrific conversationalist. I found the tennis court at last.  $ ? FRANZ  ABOUT BOOKS</p>
