        <p>LEAD: When his soldiers walk into a neighborhood on their new mission of winning the people's hearts and minds, ''they begin from below zero,'' said Col. Jesus Ranjo.

        <p>When his soldiers walk into a neighborhood on their new mission of winning the people's hearts and minds, ''they begin from below zero,'' said Col. Jesus Ranjo. ''Because of past abuses, people believe, 'Oh, the soldiers are here for no good,' '' said the colonel, who is in charge of civic action for the Manila area.</p>
        <p>The soldiers, too, are finding it difficult to adapt to their new role.</p>
        <p>''I really had a hard time making the boys understand our assignment here,'' said Maj. Jovito Palparan, who commands the program in the Valenzuela and San Pedro neighborhoods of the capital. ''They are used to fighting battles, to killing the enemy.'' Imitating Communist Tactic</p>
        <p>The ''special operations teams'' of 20 to 30 men that these officers command are the military's newest approach to the Communist insurgency, targeting not the armed rebels but their civilian supporters.</p>
        <p>The approach is a conscious imitation of the Communists' political organizing, which, both the Communists and the military agree, has won over about 20 percent of the country's barrios.</p>
        <p>''We have copied the four togethers of Mao Zedong,'' said Col. Rene Dado, a brigade commander. ''Live together, eat together, study together, work together.''</p>
        <p>''It's not body counts we go by, but numbers of influenced barangays,'' he said. The barangay is the smallest unit of government, either a small village or an urban neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Like the insurgents' political cadre, the special operations teams try to set up local support groups that will offer the soldiers assistance and information on enemy movements. 'We Are Counter-Organizing'</p>
        <p>''They are organizing. We are counter-organizing,'' Colonel Dado said. ''There is no fighting. It's their idea versus our idea.''</p>
        <p>This new battlefield of ideas, Major Palparan conceded, can be as treacherous as the more familiar arena of ambushes and booby traps.</p>
        <p>''The Communist Party's issues are very attractive to the people, the issues of feudalism, capitalism and imperialism,'' he said. ''If we are confronted by ideologues, we have a problem.''</p>
        <p>''Their issues are attractive because it's all true,'' the major said. ''We have no answer to that. All we can tell them is, Communism is not the answer. We are just sidestepping the main issues raised by the Communists.''</p>
        <p>Over the 19 years of the insurgency, the Communists have succeeded not only in winning over a portion of the population but, to a large degree, in defining the areas of debate and the basic analysis of the nation's problems. 'We Cannot Stop It'</p>
        <p>''We agree on the basic issues,'' Major Palparan said. ''There are even some officers who say, 'Why not try Communism? We have tried democracy. We have tried dictatorship, we have tried being a colony. None of them have worked.' ''</p>
        <p>Thus, he said, no matter what the military's tactics, on the battlefield or the field of debate, it cannot defeat the insurgency alone.</p>
        <p>''As long as the Government cannot address the issues brought out by the Communists, about the pyramid where the few control the many, we can only delay the movement,'' he said. ''We cannot stop it.''</p>
