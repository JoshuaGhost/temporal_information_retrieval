        <p>LEAD: Foreign ministers of the 12-nation European Community approved an accord today that establishes formal relations with the Soviet-led Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon.</p>
        <p>Foreign ministers of the 12-nation European Community approved an accord today that establishes formal relations with the Soviet-led Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon.</p>
        <p>The agreement, which was initialed by officials of the European Community and Comecon last week in Moscow, will go into effect at a signing ceremony here on June 25.</p>
        <p>The accord sets the stage for exchanges of information but does not establish bilateral trade relations. It marks the Communist bloc's first official recognition of the European Community since the Common Market was created 31 years ago. For years, Moscow and its Communist allies virtually ignored the community, calling it a quasi-military extension of the NATO alliance.</p>
