        <p>LEAD: A 17-year-old girl testified yesterday that a group of young men discussed ways of murdering a taxi dispatcher who had appeared before a grand jury, and described how one man aimed a shotgun at the floor and pretended to shoot the woman.</p>
        <p>A 17-year-old girl testified yesterday that a group of young men discussed ways of murdering a taxi dispatcher who had appeared before a grand jury, and described how one man aimed a shotgun at the floor and pretended to shoot the woman.</p>
        <p>The prosecution witness, Rose Jefferson, in State Supreme Court in Jamaica, Queens, said the men decided ''to go to the cab stand late at night and buck them in the head.''</p>
        <p>''Them'' was anyone who happened to be with the 61-year-old victim, Mildred Greene, at the time. When asked by an assistant district attorney, James Quinn, the definition of ''buck,'' the witness said, ''To shoot 'em.''</p>
        <p>During the first day of testimony, Miss Jefferson said that Derrick (Divine) Kornegay, 22, Paul (P-Man) King, 18, Tracey (Fox) Middleton, 19, and Waddell (J. R.) Winston, 27, plotted the killing last Oct. 2 in a basement described by law-enforcement officials as a crack den in a house at 111-40 155th Street in South Jamaica. Victim Was a Witness</p>
        <p>Mr. Kornegay is facing trial on charges of attempted murder in a shooting outside the Big D Royal Car Service office at 150-01 Linden Boulevard last Sept. 2.</p>
        <p>The prosecution said the shooting arose from a dispute with a Big D driver over a fare. Ms. Greene, who was on duty at the time of the shooting, testified about what she saw of that shooting before a Queens grand jury on Oct. 1. Shortly after 4 A.M. on Oct. 4, she was shot dead while she worked alone at the car service.</p>
        <p>Miss Jefferson said she had lived in the basement at the 155th Street house and served as ''a secretary.''</p>
        <p>She said that on Oct. 1 a man called Freedom told Mr. Kornegay that an aunt of Freedom's on the grand jury said Mr. Kornegay had been indicted for the earlier shooting. 'Pow, Pow, Pow'</p>
        <p>On Oct. 2, Miss Jefferson said she saw Mr. Kornegay ''banging his hands against the wall,'' as he told theothers that if Ms. Greene had testified he would have to go to jail.</p>
        <p>Miss Jefferson recalled, ''J. R. said, 'What are you going to do about it?' and then he (Mr. Kornegay) said, 'Kill her.' ''</p>
        <p>Later that day, she said, as the men made plans, Mr. Winston pumped a 12-gauge shotgun, pointed it at the floor, and ''he was saying, 'Pow, Pow, Pow.' ''</p>
        <p>She said Mr. Kornegay was to go to a hotel with his wife to provide an alibi, and the two triggermen were to take shotguns to the car service office.</p>
        <p>''First, J. R. was to shoot her in the head, and Tracey was to shoot her with the double-barrel and just in case she wasn't dead, he was to use the 9 millimeter,'' Miss Jefferson said.</p>
        <p>The prosecution contends that Mr. Winston and Mr. Middleton entered a rear door, kicked in the door of an inner office where she tried to hide, and then both of them shot her in the head.</p>
