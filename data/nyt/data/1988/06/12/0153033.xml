        <p>LEAD: THE SMALL TRAIN from Domodossola, an Italian border town, snakes among the granite mountains of Switzerland's Ticino region.

        <p>THE SMALL TRAIN from Domodossola, an Italian border town, snakes among the granite mountains of Switzerland's Ticino region. This is where Patricia Highsmith lives, in a village of 250 inhabitants, above the stark Maggia valley. She is on time to meet me at the crossroads of the local station. ''Watch out!'' she calls, a traffic warning. But no car is in sight, just her yellow Volkswagen.</p>
        <p>''A dangerous corner,'' she mutters, strapping herself into the driver's seat, eyes darting left and right. Dressed in freshly pressed jeans, a lavender bandana, an open shirt and white sneakers, the author of the diabolic ''Strangers on a Train'' and 18 other novels that probe the psychology of criminals may be the most cautious citizen in these desolate parts.</p>
        <p>I interviewed Highsmith 11 years ago, noting then that she had a face that looked haunted. Now, at 67, the remarkable face seems accustomed to its ghosts, more assured, but also more wary. The eyes, hooded, are always on the lookout, like those of her favorite bird, the owl.</p>
        <p>Patricia Highsmith was living in England two decades ago when Julian Symons, the dean of British crime writing, took note of her work, and since then she has enjoyed a high reputation in Europe. ''The deadly games of pursuit played in her best novels,'' Symons wrote, ''dig down very deeply into the roots of personality. . . . she has already produced work as serious in its implications and as subtle in its approach as anything being done in the novel today.''</p>
        <p>Graham Greene, in his 1970 introduction to ''Eleven,'' a collection of early Highsmith short stories, wrote that she ''is the poet of apprehension rather than fear. Fear after a time, as we all learned in the blitz, is narcotic, it can lull one by fatigue into sleep, but apprehension nags at the nerves gently and inescapably. We have to learn to live with it.'' And Peter Handke, the acclaimed Austrian novelist and playwright, said in 1975, ''Not since Dostoyevsky has an author been so generous with readers, giving so many details about the book's hero.''</p>
        <p>In the last decade, her reputation has been confirmed from Scandinavia to Japan. Oddly, however, she has never achieved much recognition in her birthplace, the United States, even though several of her books have spawned popular movies.</p>
        <p>''In Germany, she has been famous for so long, she is stopped in the street in Munich for autographs,'' says her German-language publisher, Daniel Keel. ''And when she goes to Spain, the Prime Minister invites her to dine. But in the U. S., her sales have been the worst in the world. For years, she got rejection slips saying, 'It's old-fashioned, not well written.' ''</p>
        <p>One theory to explain her lack of readership here is that her amoral explorations of perverse behavior have confused American readers of crime fiction. As Anthony Boucher, reviewing her novel ''The Glass Cell'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1964, said, ''I find the book wordy, and the people and the thesis somewhat unconvincing, yet there's a certain harsh power here that is compelling.''</p>
        <p>The novelist herself feels that because she has lived abroad, and has never been in this country to promote her books, she has never established continuity with her publishers - she has had several here - or her public. Others, like the novelist Gore Vidal, who has written mysteries as the pseudonymous Edgar Box, believe she has been ignored on this side of the Atlantic because her books are too subtle, too hard to peg. ''Our American bookchat deals only with categories,'' Vidal says, ''so she was never really reviewed until European critics instructed Americans that Highsmith - or  [ Georges ]  Simenon - could be taken as literature.''</p>
        <p>Gary Fisketjon, the editorial director of Atlantic Monthly Press, agrees. Last fall, Atlantic Monthly published ''Found in the Street,'' Highsmith's 19th novel, and since then has reprinted two previous titles, ''Game for the Living'' and ''The Two Faces of January.'' Two more reissues will be published this year, and Fisketjon has also signed up a new collection of short stories, due out next February. Highsmith has suffered from being considered a genre writer here, Fisketjon says, and he's hopeful that Atlantic's commitment to publish her as they would a ''literary'' writer will garner the readership she deserves. ''She's had to wait 35 years for acceptance here,'' Fisketjon says. ''People were looking for nice thrillers. We have no equivalent for Graham Greene.''</p>
        <p>''I correspond with Graham Greene,'' Patricia Highsmith says, Greene,'' Patricia Highsmith says, hunched over the steering wheel as we wind up the hill to her house. ''I admire his sense of the morbid. I have his telephone number, but I would never use it,'' she adds.</p>
        <p>IT'S HARD TO PIN DOWN WHAT happens in a Highsmith book, for almost nothing does. Are they thrillers? Mysteries? Murder is not really the point; it is merely a metaphor. The novels are hardly whodunits, since we always know who did it - or will be driven to do it. The mystery is in the protagonist's mind, his makeup. We sympathize with him and hope he will not be found out. Often, he isn't. Life may even get better for him, as it does for the gentleman forger and occasional murderer Tom Ripley, the protagonist of four novels, who lives the life of a country squire on his estate near Fontainebleau.</p>
        <p>Ripley is a favorite character, free-wheeling and good at disguises. And he's not affected by killing somebody - if they've asked for it. Also, I make him attractive in his looks.''</p>
        <p>Her most vivid figures - always men - are loners, such as the disquieting Bruno in ''Strangers on a Train,'' published when Highsmith was 29. Bruno proposes trading murders with Guy, an architect: If Guy will kill Bruno's tyrannical father, Bruno will murder Guy's estranged wife. On his way to a new marriage and career, Guy would be the last person to go for such a mad scheme. Or would he? Bruno becomes his doppelganger, crowding him, taking him over, and Guy's life comes unraveled.</p>
        <p>This sense of the ordinary gone askew creates an uncanny atmosphere that has attracted such film makers as Alfred Hitchcock, who directed ''Strangers on a Train'' in 1951; Rene Clement, who adapted ''Purple Noon'' from ''The Talented Mr. Ripley''; Wim Wenders, who made ''The American Friend'' from ''Ripley's Game''; and, recently, Claude Chabrol, who adapted ''The Cry of the Owl.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps these world-class directors were drawn to a basic dramatic characteristic, which she describes as follows: ''It's always interesting . . . when two people opposite in nature get tangled up. I've always done that; it's like pitting good and evil, putting two strong boxers into the ring.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was this scene, illustrative of the contrasting natures of Guy and Bruno, that attracted Hitchcock:</p>
        <p>'' 'I expected too much of her,' Guy said casually, 'without any right to. She happened to like attention. She'll probably flirt all her life, no matter whom she's with.'</p>
        <p>'' 'I know, the eternal high school type.' Bruno waved his hand. 'Can't even pretend to belong to one guy, ever.'</p>
        <p>''Guy looked at him. Miriam had, of course, once.</p>
        <p>''Abruptly, he abandoned his idea of telling Bruno, ashamed that he had nearly begun. Bruno seemed unconcerned now, in fact, whether he told it or not. Slumped, Bruno was drawing with a match in the gravy of his plate. The down-turned half of his mouth, in profile, was sunken between nose and chin like the mouth of an old man. The mouth seemed to say, whatever the story, it was really beneath his contempt to listen.</p>
        <p>'' 'Women like that draw men,' Bruno mumbled, 'like garbage draws flies.' ''*</p>
        <p>A SENSE OF PLACE, METICULOUSLY documented, pervades Highsmith's novels, but the places change - as have her homes. Tom Ripley's criminal dabbling, for instance, has him impersonating a painter in London, rescuing a boy in Berlin, flying to Salzburg to track a witness. The beauty of the Riviera can move a man to murder; and Tunisia, in one of Highsmith's finest novels, ''The Tremor of Forgery,'' turns the world upside down for a writer away from home.</p>
        <p>Her two ambitions as a young woman, she has said, were to move to Europe and to write a book. She's lived abroad -in England, France and, for the last six years, Switzerland - since her late 20's, when the canny Hitchcock paid her $6,800 for rights in perpetuity to ''Strangers on a Train.'' She has an eye for the American out of touch with his world and with himself, as shown in this passage from ''The Talented Mr. Ripley.''</p>
        <p>''He felt alone, yet not at all lonely. It was very much like the feeling on Christmas Eve in Paris, a feeling that everyone was watching him, as if he had an audience made up of the entire world, a feeling that kept him on his mettle, because to make a mistake would be catastrophic. Yet he felt absolutely confident that he would not make a mistake.''** Today, arriving with me from the train station, she parks the car in a hollow below the house. ''This is an avalanche region, the house next to mine was completely destroyed, but mine wasn't touched,'' she says. Like the mountains behind it, the 200-year-old farmhouse is made of granite. She carries up a case of beer in liter bottles. ''I love coming home,'' she says, ''wherever I make a home.''</p>
        <p>The door is unlocked. For such a cautious woman, she seems to live dangerously -the precariously situated house is insured only against ''normal risks,'' she says. We enter a dark hallway; there's a whiff of cat. Semyon, a 13-year-old Siamese, and the Swiss-born red-haired Charlotte, are there to greet her.</p>
        <p>''When I moved here, there was no electricity or running water,'' she says. Opposite the kitchen, a vast fireplace is where she grills lamb chops. ''That's about as much cooking as I do.''</p>
        <p>She brews coffee, whips up eggs for the cats' breakfast. Dining room and kitchen are one functional unit. Books and papers deck the table, along with binoculars for bird-watching and a hunting knife. She attacks her mail with a letter opener. ''I pay bills as soon as I get them - I don't want things cluttered,'' she says. ''I don't want my brain cluttered.''</p>
        <p>Semy dozes in his own armchair, on an electric blanket. She shows me a stool. ''When I need a piece of furniture, I usually make it.'' She also paints; a portrait of a beautiful young woman hangs by the window. ''That was done in thin oil about 20 years ago,'' she says. ''It looks like a friend.'' A poster from Amnesty International - she is a member - is on the door.</p>
        <p>Adjoining, ''My workroom.'' There is an office desk from Lyons, with plenty of drawers. Her manual Olympia typewriter is on top. Bookshelves contain reference works: a German-English dictionary, ''London, Street by Street Geography,'' ''How to Fix Almost Everything,'' ''The Basic Book of the Cat'' and a ''Complete Works of William Shakespeare.''</p>
        <p>We return to the kitchen, where she spends most of the morning on her feet, feeding birds pizza out the window, making phone calls, announcing herself gently: ''Hello, it's Highsmith.'' She does not so much read the papers - the International Herald Tribune, The Christian Science Monitor - as raid them for fuel. Here are the news items, the exposes that fire her imagination; she has no television.</p>
        <p>''This Reagan era, the phoniness! Balzac would have a field day,'' she says, laughing excitedly. A surprising sound: an outlaw lurks in that laughter.</p>
        <p>HIGHSMITH TALKS about her moves around Europe, adding, ''If you have an imagination that goes far afield, you can live far afield. My ideas are not related to where I was born, or to the family, and, I must say, I mistrust writers who use their family because I think they're not imaginative. Where I was born, Fort Worth, Texas, was not terribly interesting. Some dramatic things happened in my family, but I wouldn't dream of writing about them.''</p>
        <p>She speaks about them, though, and with precisely the same equanimity she uses describing her tortured characters; the words are few, but suddenly lethal. Five months before Highsmith's birth, she says, her mother tried to abort. ''She really tried to get rid of it - she told me - I didn't mind. She said, 'It's funny you adore the smell of turpentine, Pat.' Because she drank turpentine before I was born trying to have a miscarriage. I didn't mind one bit,'' she repeats.</p>
        <p>Her parents divorced; her mother, an illustrator for Women's Wear Daily, traveled. She says she did not meet her father, Jay Bernard Plangman, until she was 12. She was raised in New York, mostly in Greenwich Village, by a grandmother.</p>
        <p>''I could read like a streak, because my grandmother taught me when I was two,'' she says. Her mother, who had remarried, to a man named Stanley Highsmith, enrolled her in primary school under his name. ''It wasn't even legal,'' she says. ''Later, I had to have myself adopted to get a passport.'' By then, she had graduated from Barnard College.</p>
        <p>Today, Highsmith's mother, at 91, lives in a nursing home in Fort Worth. ''I take care of that, financially,'' the novelist says. She has not seen her mother since 1974.</p>
        <p>In the family album, there are pictures of her mother, first a doll-like girl, then a fashionable, pretty woman, with a heart-shaped face and stubborn chin. Farther in the album, pictures of the Barnard graduate reveal that she, too, was a beauty, but of another ilk. Her eyes are veiled, the sensual mouth secretive. I say that it is a compelling face, willful. ''Everybody 21 is ambitious,'' she acknowledges, shutting the album.</p>
        <p>I usually make popcorn this time of the morning,'' the writer says, just before noon, serving up a batch with drinks. She takes her liquor from a plain, unmarked bottle, offering me ''the better whisky,'' and I think of all the Dornkaat and Pilsener Urquell - nothing but the finest local brews - and White Horse whisky her immoral characters enjoy.</p>
        <p>Why, I ask, does she prefer men as heroes?</p>
        <p>''Women are tied to the home, tied to somebody, not as independent to travel -and they don't have the physical strength, if needed. Men can do more, like jump over fences.''</p>
        <p>The scrutiny is making her fidget; she has been eyeing her watch, as though time, or tolerance, were running out. She tells me her schedule. When she is writing, she works even at night, with few distractions from her spartan life - coffee with friends, but no country walks: ''My only exercise is at midnight; I do something strenuous for five minutes.'' Even when she is not working, now, during my visit, she runs to her typewriter often, to fire off a letter, like a pianist warming up.</p>
        <p>''As I get older, I need less sleep. So if I wake at 4:30, it doesn't bother me. I can switch on the medium wave and get the American Forces in Frankfort for a news program, then the BBC World Service comes on in German. At 6, if you fall back to sleep, you can have a vivid dream; you have to lie there and etch it in your brain.'' She jots down her dreams, she says, which she collects, along with germs of story ideas, in her cahiers -spiral notebooks, bought in Manhattan. ''They are identical,'' she says. ''They measure 7 by 8 1/4 inches, and cost 37 cents. I am on cahier number 36, and I've kept them since I was 15.''</p>
        <p>As for her writing methods, she says, ''I write action passages fast, but what comes after might need a mood change. I retype my books two-and-a-half times. I like retyping for neatness and polish, not style - style does not interest me in the least. Emotion is worth more than the intellect.'' To her, the painter Francis Bacon represents what is really happening in our times: ''It's his emotion, the way he sees mankind throwing up into a toilet.''</p>
        <p>Later, we take a drive to visit her friend Vivien, who lives in the valley. We pass through an end-of-the-world landscape - a dry gorge fringed by pale birch. A smart rat-tat-tat breaks the silence. ''Ah, the woodpecker!'' She smiles.</p>
        <p>Vivien, who works with disabled children, lives in a modern, spic-and-span house. She serves coffee and pastry, followed by whisky. The two women swap books and horror stories about the local society - the grocer who sold milk contaminated by the fall-out from Chernobyl; parents who mistreat their children, purposely contradicting what they learned in school.</p>
        <p>''Those people have no moral fiber, lying to their children!'' The writer is outraged.</p>
        <p>WE ARE EATING a pizza at a local inn when I ask how she feels about children. ''Never wanted them. I'm too selfish about my time.'' The child of an unpredictable mother, she developed her own, unswerving vision early.</p>
        <p>At 8, she was reading Sherlock Holmes; by 14, she had read ''Moby Dick'' twice. These days, nonfiction interests her more. Hannah Arendt on anti-Semitism at the moment, she says.</p>
        <p>''I don't read mystery writers, except for Ruth Rendell,'' another prolific chronicler of the dark soul.</p>
        <p>What she herself writes, she feels, is more real than a mystery: ''A mystery is just a puzzle. I write about somebody who is compelled to commit a crime, and the feelings of guilt or absence of guilt. I'm not so fascinated by murder, really. I do consider it the worst crime, but it happens every day.''</p>
        <p>Would she consider a novel without murder?</p>
        <p>''Oh yes, 'The Tremor of Forgery' hardly has a murder; the main character picks up his typewriter - just like mine - and hurls it, hits the fellow on the head.'' She makes it sound easy.</p>
        <p>She mentions Truman Capote and how he'd helped her get into Yaddo, the artists' colony in upstate New York, where she'd begun ''Strangers.'' During the 1940's, she says, she was impressed by the writing of Capote and Carson McCullers, particularly their talent for atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''But,'' she adds, ''do they get down to the nitty gritty of life? I don't think so, because the nitty gritty is anger, and a sense of injustice. I think a writer has to talk about adult human emotion, like Dostoyevsky. Something sustaining, compared to something which is a dream. An artist doesn't think. He falls in love with an idea.''</p>
        <p>Where do her ideas come from? ''When I'm quiet, they just come in. Sometimes I see a face on a bus or train, but nobody close. It would be like having an intruder in my own life.'' She is choosy about her intruders. Ripley, she says, she conceived on a beach in Positano. ''It was 6 in the morning, and I saw a solitary figure in shorts, 200 yards away. I thought he was probably American.''</p>
        <p>I say that she must have a strong visual memory. ''But I don't think in images,'' she insists. Rather, ideas rule.</p>
        <p>For example, she says she has always wanted to find somebody's wallet and return it with everything in it. ''That's why I wrote 'Found in the Street.' '' A contemporary New York story about a girl who becomes the object of everyone's desire, it begins with just such a discovered wallet. She researched the book by going back to New York - only a few days - walking her old Village neighborhood, Grove Street to the river. ''I went to see what the bars are like now, for the geography, not the people; I had the people in my head.''</p>
        <p>Living abroad, she feels, sharpens her perspective: ''You see the class differences in America when you live in England.'' Henry James and Edith Wharton are masters, and she admires Wharton's subtle evocations of sex, ''So sexy, much better than Hemingway.'' But she closes her eyes during sex scenes in movies: ''I'm squeamish. If I walked into somebody's hotel room, I would walk out and hope they didn't hear me.''</p>
        <p>She has brought her scruples to bear even on the way she would like to leave the world - with as little disturbance as possible. She tells me about Exit, the right-to-die society. Like Arthur Koestler, an old friend who took his own life several years ago, she belongs. ''It is not a suicide club; you make your own conditions. If you lose pleasure reading, that could be your limit. People age; I do the best I can. One day, I'll be cremated.''</p>
        <p>How does she think she will be remembered by readers of the future?</p>
        <p>''I don't think about it. I guess I would like to be considered a good entertainer. But each book is, in a sense, an argument with myself, and I would write it, whether it is ever published or not.''  * Copyright (c) 1950 By Patricia Highsmith  ** Copyright (c) 1955 By Patricia Highsmith</p>
