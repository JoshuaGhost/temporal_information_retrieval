        <p>LEAD: U Sein Lwin, a hard-line retired army general who reportedly commanded the forces that suppressed student riots in March, was chosen today to succeed U Ne Win as the leader of Burma's ruling party.</p>
        <p>U Sein Lwin, a hard-line retired army general who reportedly commanded the forces that suppressed student riots in March, was chosen today to succeed U Ne Win as the leader of Burma's ruling party.</p>
        <p>In a brief statement, the Central Committee of the Burma Socialist Program Party announced that it had selected him as party chairman during a special session.</p>
        <p>Western diplomats and Burmese say it was Mr. Sein Lwin who commanded forces that brutally put down the March riots, in which more than 100 people are believed to have been killed. The Government has acknowledged the deaths of 43 people, including 41 who suffocated in a police van after they were arrested.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sein Lwin also commanded an army company that killed 22 students during anti-Government demonstrations at Rangoon University in July 1962, the year Mr. Ne Win took power.</p>
        <p>The retired leader, who is 77 years old, announced last week that he was quitting after holding unchallenged power for 26 years. Rare Gesture of Independence</p>
        <p>At a final session of an extraordinary three-day party congress Monday, delegates ''firmly suggested'' that a referendum proposed by Mr. Ne Win on ending one-party rule in Burma be rejected. It was the first known instance where the party did not rubber-stamp Ne Win's proposals.</p>
        <p>But the elevation of Mr. Sein Lwin (pronounced sane luh-WIN), who is 64, appeared to diminish hopes that the abrupt retirement of Mr. Ne Win would lead to widespread political change in a nation that has been ruled by a one-party administration backed by the military.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sein Lwin, who ranked No. 4 in the party and was a close ally of Mr. Ne Win, served as the party's Joint General Secretary since 1985. He also had been secretary of the Council of State, a body roughly equivalent to a Cabinet. In Burma, this is the third-ranking Government post.</p>
        <p>More changes were expected Wednesday when Parliament convenes for a special session, presumably to fill Government positions and to discuss the referendum proposed by Mr. Ne Win on ending one-party rule.</p>
        <p>The legislature has the legal power to order the referendum over the party's objections, but it was not expected to.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the announcement of Mr. Sein Lwin's elevation, the state radio said two top officials had been dismissed from their posts in connection with the riots here on March 18. They were the Prime Minister, U Maung Maung Kha; and the Attorney General, U Myint Maung, The honorific U is used to precede a Burmese man's full name and is considered an essential courtesy in Burma in the absence of another governmental or professional title.</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Ne Win's announced retirement from political life, some Burmese speculated that he would remain a powerful force in the nation's political life. He has methodically eliminated potential rivals over the years, and few leaders who have survived politics here have expressed any semblance of independent thinking or action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sein Lwin's promotion was not expected to bode well for Burma's record on human rights, which has been sharply criticized in recent months by Amnesty International and other human rights organizations.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the party accepted the resignations of Mr. Ne Win and that of U SAn Yu, party Vice Chairman and Burma's President, as well as those of two lower-ranking officials.</p>
        <p>That special session ended with only vaguely worded statements issued to the public, a possible reflection of splits among party leaders over the recent events.</p>
        <p>The only new element in official statements was the approval expressed for efforts to return a number of areas of the economy to private control. Mr. Ne Win had proposed widespread economic changes.</p>
