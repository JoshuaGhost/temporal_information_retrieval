        <p>LEAD: For weeks, Larry Cochran cut deals, traded votes, bartered favors and today, at last, here he was, an Arkansas delegate to the Democratic National Convention, standing in the sun-splashed lobby of a north side Atlanta hotel and sipping champagne and orange juice.</p>
        <p>For weeks, Larry Cochran cut deals, traded votes, bartered favors and today, at last, here he was, an Arkansas delegate to the Democratic National Convention, standing in the sun-splashed lobby of a north side Atlanta hotel and sipping champagne and orange juice.</p>
        <p>Red, white and blue balloons bobbed overhead. A two-person combo swung into a sweet rendition of ''Blue Skies.'' Waiters carrying trays piled with biscuits and eggs and bagels pushed their way toward tables already groaning with food.</p>
        <p>''The hard work was getting here,'' said Mr. Cochran, a teacher from Fort Smith, as he recalled the back room deals and trading that got him to the convention. ''Now the good part begins.''</p>
        <p>All across Atlanta, in hotel suites and cavernous halls, restaurants and private homes, delegates and journalists and politicians gathered today to toast one another, consume enormous quantities of boiled jumbo shrimp and, in general, celebrate their good fortune at being here together, the day before the Democratic National Convention gets down to business.</p>
        <p>According to official schedules, there were no fewer than 89 social events on today's calendar, ranging from the Arkansas delegation's champagne brunch to a reception for members of Congress in an Atlanta park that was to include jugglers and a 150-piece orchestra.</p>
        <p>Mayor Andrew Young gave a lunch for international visitors. Representative Ed Jenkins of Georgia had fellow members of the House Ways and Means Committee out to a party at a nearby lake. And the members of Democratic Party Finance Committee took a train ride around Atlanta, and were served a buffet supper along the way.</p>
        <p>But it was Ted Turner, the Atlanta broadcasting mogul, who pulled off the greatest coup. Before some 2,500 guests, including Senators and Governors, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and Senator Lloyd Bentsen made their convention debut.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Turner sat on a stage and beamed, Mr. Dukakis, Mr. Bentsen and their wives stood arm-in-arm before the shimmering backdrop of an American flag and, in the classic convention pose, waved to the crowd of political and journalistic swells gathered in the huge atrium of the CNN Center, the headquarters of Mr. Turner's Cable News Network.</p>
        <p>Earlier, on the same stage, Mr. Turner engineered another moment: as Gene Donati's orchestra slipped into ''Putting on the Ritz,'' Jimmy Carter rose to dance with his wife, Rosalynn.</p>
        <p>And at a bash in the Woodruff Arts Center held by The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, the Rev. Jesse Jackson mingled among the nearly 3,000 guests grazing on grits, biscuits and cornbread. Fewer Lavish Parties</p>
        <p>Officially, the word was that many large commercial news organizations, like The New York Times, Time Inc., and The Washington Post Company, had cut back on lavish entertainment and parties that, over the years, had become standard convention fare. But one organization that was not stinting was the Gannett Corporation and its newspaper USA Today, which filled a yawning hall at the Atlanta Apparel Mart this morning with five bars, a five-piece Dixieland band, a strolling magician and seven tables stacked with everything from oysters on the half shell and salmon to waffles and fresh strawberries.</p>
        <p>They also won, hands down, for best party favor: Guests could have their photograph taken next to a full-size cardboard Governor Dukakis, propped in front of a blowup of the newspaper's front page, and the moment was instantly transformed into a campaign button.</p>
        <p>But for many Democrats, the Gannett reception was also the toughest one to get into, not because of stringent security but because of a noisy picket line set up in front of the building by the Service Employes International Union, whose efforts on behalf of janitors have led it into a dispute with John Portman, the Atlanta developer who owns the Apparel Mart.</p>
        <p>Jean Patterson, a delegate of Democrats Abroad, a group made up of party members who live overseas, said she sneaked around to another entrance rather than cross the pikcet line. ''I'm a good Democrat and I really could not face those pickets in good conscience,'' Mrs. Patterson said. A number of other Democrats did run the gauntlet of jeering pickets, which included a young man with a megaphone who said the protesters would remember every Congressman who passed. Easy to Draw Crowd</p>
        <p>With 35,000 lobbyists, elected officials, journalists and delegates in town, it's not hard to get people to show up at a party. As long as the party is air-conditioned, there is sure to be a quorum.</p>
        <p>The trick is getting the right people to come. Everyone wants Governor Dukakis or the Mr. Jackson or Senator Bentsen. What they end up settling for, in many cases, are members of the Democrats Abroad, who wield only 22 votes but have come to Atlanta from places like Israel and France and Costa Rica. ''They're all fighting over us,'' said Maureen Coots, a delegate who lives in Belgium. ''We may be small, but we're exotic.'' Few Outdoor Events</p>
        <p>With near 100-degree temperatures wilting everything and everybody, few events were held outdoors. That point was underscored by a conversation overheard in the lobby of the Hyatt Regency, where an important Democratic Party contributor, a hefty man with a mustache, listened irritably while an aide briefed him on the evening's schedule of social events. ''Look,'' he said finally. ''I'm not going to anything outdoors. Ever. Cancel that one.'' Even indoors, air-conditioners struggled without avail to keep ice sculptures from melting too fast, and shrimp that had been neatly arranged on beds of shaved ice bobbed instead in limpid pools of meltwater, like survivors of some culinary shipwreck. Drummed Out of Work</p>
        <p>Whatever music the Democrats hope to make in Atlanta, it won't belong to Steve Cohen. Despite the plethora of parties and merrymaking, Mr. Cohen, a drummer and the leader of Steve Cohen's Band, landed just one booking for all of convention week.</p>
        <p>Not only that, but he says his business playing wedding receptions is also off 70 percent for July. ''There are no weddings in Atlanta this month,'' he complained. ''The hotels are all booked for the convention.''</p>
        <p>He said he did turn down one gig: an offer from the Democrats to take his band outside Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport over the weekend, to serenade arriving delegates.</p>
        <p>''Are you kidding?'' he asked. ''Play outdoors for 11 hours a day in this heat? That's the musical equivalent of the Bataan death march.'' Texans in a Tiff</p>
        <p>Not quite everybody had a perfectly swell time. Consider the Texans. Politically upbeat over the choice of Senator Bentsen as the Vice-President nominee and Ann Richards, the Texas State Treasurer, as keynote speaker, the Lone Star state delegates found their delegation party something of a downer.</p>
        <p>They threw a party at the Sports Rock Cafe, ordinarily a hangout for teen-agers, 15 miles north of Atlanta. Problem is, the delegation is staying at the Airport Marriott Hotel, 15 miles south of Atlanta. Many people who were jammed cheek to jowl at the party thought this logistical inequity was plotted against them by Paul G. Kirk Jr., the Democratic national chairman, in retaliation for their complaints over his having the convention here rather than in Houston.</p>
        <p>As one Congressman, atypically reticent about allowing his name to be used for publication, put it, ''It's that Kirk getting even with us.''  THE DEMOCRATS IN ATLANTA</p>
