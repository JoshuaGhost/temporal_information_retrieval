        <p>LEAD: Ever since their revolution in 1974, the Portuguese have been trying to undo their complicated, leftist-oriented Constitution.</p>
        <p>Ever since their revolution in 1974, the Portuguese have been trying to undo their complicated, leftist-oriented Constitution.</p>
        <p>It is a document that not only sets forth the principles of nationhood, as constitutions do, but also deals with administrative details and day-to-day issues like provisions for hiring and dismissing workers.</p>
        <p>Every political grouping here, except the Communists, is in favor of ridding the Constitution of its complexities. But the effort so far has been an intense internal struggle for the year-old center-right Government and its leader, Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva.</p>
        <p>The right and the left both blame the Constitution for much of the country's political instability since 1974. Sixteen governments had tried to bring order to the chaos before the current Social Democratic one, the first to govern with a majority in Parliament, was elected in June 1987. Blames the Opposition</p>
        <p>Mr. Cavaco Silva conducted a slick campaign that convinced voters that he needed a majority to get the country rolling. During the 18 months preceding that election, when he headed a minority Government, he complained constantly that he was hamstrung by the opposition.</p>
        <p>Since the election, Mr. Cavaco Silva's popularity and support have declined, although his complaints about the opposition have not. But now, his critics include many from his own party, who feel he also has himself to blame for his troubles. Even with a huge majority in Parliament, Mr. Cavaco Silva has not been able to mount a consistent and successful legislative program or achieve a major victory.</p>
        <p>Although many Portuguese view the Constitution as the reason for the impasse, others say the problem may be the Prime Minister's style. Mr. Cavaco Silva is considered extremely confident, even arrogant, according to Antonio Barreto, a Socialist member of Parliament. The weekly Expresso lent weight to this feeling when it quoted Mr. Cavaco Silva as saying about himself: ''I was a brilliant student. I always try to be the best. It's not vanity. I take things very seriously.'' Evidence of Prosperity</p>
        <p>Evidence abounds that many Portuguese are better off economically than they were five years ago: new cars add to traffic snarls and pollution, downtown stores and shopping malls are always busy, and crowds of people patronize fashionable bars and restaurants. Yet most Portuguese seem to feel that the Prime Minister has been unable to exploit his 1987 election victory, when the Social Democrats won 148 of 250 seats in Parliament and the votes of 50 percent of the electorate, an extraordinary showing here.</p>
        <p>''He is proving that he is a better leader of a minority government than a majority,'' Mr. Barreto said. ''He has used the wrong tactics. Instead of moving fast with his mandate, he was cautious; and instead of first working to change the Constitution so that he could legally accomplish his goals, he tried to get them without the change. Now he is paying.'' Supporters counter that the Prime Minister has been correct, although some say he should have done more at a faster pace. They say his programs have been stymied by adverse rulings of the Constitutional Court.</p>
        <p>Miguel Belega, the Central Bank Governor, put the blame on the political system, declaring that the Government has been thwarted by the Socialist opposition and the Constitutional Court. He said the court ''is a political body, not comparable to the United States Supreme Court.'' Poll Shows Popularity Drop</p>
        <p>The Prime Minister's popularity rating dropped from 69 percent last November to 40 percent in May, according to a poll by Expresso.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Cavaco Silva's overwhelming victory, opponents and some supporters urged him to cooperate with the Socialists to secure the needed two-thirds vote to change the Constitution before pursuing major laws. But, as Mr. Barreto and others noted, Mr. Cavaco Silva tried to get his program through Parliament with the simple majority that was already his.</p>
        <p>As a result, in May, the Constitutional Court declared his labor reform package unconstitutional; the Constitution would have to be amended before its provisions could be altered. The Government was also forced to pull back its agrarian reform proposal when the opposition pointed out that the constitutional requirement of proper debate had been ignored. Cabinet Shuffle Expected</p>
        <p>There are continuing reports of a coming Cabinet shuffle, while many people on the far right who have supported him say his conservative policies do not go far enough. And the Socialists, who once worried that he might easily serve out his remaining four years as well as win re-election, are less discouraged now.</p>
        <p>Joao Cravinho, a Socialist lawmaker, said the Mr. Cavaco Silva now has three problems: timing a Cabinet shuffle to avoid the appearance of acting under pressure; the question of who gets which post, and the local and European Parliament elections next year and presidential elections in 1990. ''The Prime Minister and his party have to decide if they are going to oppose Mario Soares as president,'' he said. ''I'm certain right-wingers in the party will want to, but it's a dilemma.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Soares, a Socialist, is President and thus has the power to either sign laws or decide to send them to the Constitutional Court - as he did in May, to the dismay of the Social Democrats. In addition, polls show that he is much more popular than Mr. Cavaco Silva.</p>
