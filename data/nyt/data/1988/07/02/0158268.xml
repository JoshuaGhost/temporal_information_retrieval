        <p>LEAD: THE purest play in the municipal bond market is direct investment.

        <p>THE purest play in the municipal bond market is direct investment. Some people prefer to choose their bonds directly and structure their own portfolios, rather than relying on mutual funds or unit investment trusts. But direct investing requires sizable amounts of money and the time for active portfolio management - as well as some expertise.</p>
        <p>''If a client or potential customer calls me up and says, 'I'm rolling over a C.D. and want to lock up a good muni and not worry,' my advice is always the same - put your money in Government securities and pay the tax on the income,'' Jay Goldinger, wrote recently in his ''Early Warning Wire'' newsletter.</p>
        <p>''There's less risk in governments,'' he wrote. ''Prices don't vary that much from broker to broker. They're easy to sell if you have to cash out. And, they may even offer you higher rates of return over all if you have to sell out.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the price of of any bond - Government or corporate, as well as municipal - rises when interest rates fall and drops when rates rise.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Goldinger, who is the co-founder and principal of Capital Insight Inc., a retail and institutional brokerage in Beverly Hills, Calif., notes: ''You can call six brokers and get six different quotes on the same muni bond. And this is exactly what you should do.''</p>
        <p>Louis A. D'Andrea, first vice president in charge of trading for the municipal bond department of Prudential-Bache Securities, acknowledged that odd lots of municipal bonds ''can be offered at different prices at different shops,'' because the munis are over-the-counter securities with limited liquidity and no standardized quotation system. ''So buyers often comparison shop,'' he said. The typical individual investors in municipal bonds are ''sophisticated people with several brokerage accounts,'' Mr. D'Andrea said.</p>
        <p>A round lot of a $1,000 bond costs $100,000, but most investors buy odd lots of munis - in amounts of $5,000, $10,000 or $25,000 - to build a diversified portfolio with staggered maturities.</p>
        <p>''We have recently had some $1 million blocks of bonds from individual investors,'' Mr. D'Andrea said. ''This year has been exceptionally good, and retail has been excellent because municipal bonds are about the last haven for tax-exempt income. Muni zeros have been big sellers.'' Because commissions are higher on odd lots than on round lots, anyone with less than $100,000 should invest turn to a no-load mutual fund. Mr. Goldinger said. But he recommended that investors try to avoid funds that charge a back-end load or other redemption fees. Commissions can range from $2 or $4 for each $1,000 bond, to $25 to $50 a bond, he said. High commissions make it difficult to earn a profit in the muni market, he added, as do the wide bid and ask price spreads that prevail.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldinger also cautions that the idea that bonds are a ''long-term, buy-and-hold forever investment'' may have been true in the 1940's and 1950's, ''but it's a one-way ticket to oblivion in the volatile '80's,'' he said. Get out quickly if you make a mistake, he advises.</p>
        <p>For those who want to trade directly, Mr. Goldinger recommends buying deeply discounted AA or AAA-rated municipal bonds selling at 40 percent, 50 percent or 60 percent of their face value with maturities of 7 to 20 years. They are discounted because they have low coupons - 4 percent to 5 percent, which give them a 7 1/2 to 8 percent yield to maturity. ''But being low coupon and deeply discounted, they have the greatest potential for price appreciation as interest rates continue to fall,'' he said. Unlike most other analysts, Mr. Goldinger contends that the economy is in a deflationary cycle and that rates will fall.</p>
        <p>Walter (Bud) Kingston Jr., chief portfolio manager of the Freedom Managed Tax-Exempt Fund, a $13 million open-end fund from the Tucker Anthony Management Company, said that investors need to have an interest-rate forecast in mind to trade bonds. Mr. Kingston's current forecast is that 30-year Treasuries will ''hover around 9 percent for a while'' and go up toward the end of the year.</p>
        <p>An individual's tax bracket obviously plays a key role in deciding whether municipal bonds are an appropriate investment. For someone in the 33 percent Federal income tax bracket, a taxable bond would have to yield 10 1/2 percent to provide the same after-tax return as a 7 percent municipal bond.</p>
        <p>In such high-tax states as New York, Pennsylvania and California, a local issue will escape state taxes, as well as Federal taxes, so a taxable issue has to offer a considerably higher return to be competitive on an after-tax basis, Mr. D'Andrea noted.</p>
        <p>''Most of our retail accounts are in triple-A insured paper,'' because investors want ''to feel comfortable,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Kingston said, bond buyers should always look to the quality of the underlying credit of an issue. ''Insurance can make a good bond better, but it can't make a bad bond good,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For those who find all these considerations involved in buying bonds too complex, a mutual fund or unit investment trust offers a diversified, professionally selected portfolio. Funds actively manage their portfolios, whereas trusts offer fixed portfolios that are normally held to maturity unless called.</p>
        <p>''We recommend that individuals with $25,000 or less to invest'' go that route, Mr. D'Andrea said.</p>
