        <p>LEAD: Last night, finally, television gave the nation what first radio and then television taught us to recognize as an authentic political convention. Not long after the networks took to the air, the nominations for the Presidency began. No surprises in store, little spontaneity permitted.

        <p>Last night, finally, television gave the nation what first radio and then television taught us to recognize as an authentic political convention. Not long after the networks took to the air, the nominations for the Presidency began. No surprises in store, little spontaneity permitted. Yet gradually the delegates took over from the leaders, and the screen drew a little life from the inklings of individuality.</p>
        <p>No, none of the faces were as moving as those that were brought into our homes the previous night when the cameras lingered on black women of all ages caught up in the Rev. Jesse Jackson's rhythms and the reality of the hard times and long travels he evoked with such skill. And, no, the name of this show was not Democracy in Action. It was more Preston Sturges than Frank Capra, but very American. The NBC cameras seemed especially diligent in searching out good faces. Here were citizens from all over who had come to Atlanta to play the political game, maybe do a deal, see a sight, enjoy the parties, rub elbows with bigshots, glimpse small-screen favorites up close - and maybe even get on television themselves. Being in the vicinity of a television camera is a big plus for a vacation.</p>
        <p>The seconding speeches gave the networks a chance to plug in the commercials that were withheld during the nominating speeches. (ABC stuck some in during the latter portions of the tedious tribute to Michael Dukakis by Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a speech that lost the audience inside the hall and, probably, a lot of the national audience as well.) Compared with the real folks in the Omni Coliseum, the characters who spend all that time talking about cereals and pain relievers seemed even faker than usual. The delegates had come to Atlanta from lifetimes in real towns and cities, and it showed.</p>
        <p>That is not to say there was much more to report from Atlanta on Wednesday than there was on Monday or Tuesday. As Linda Ellerbee observed on CNN, in a comment on journalistic overkill at the convention, ''There is no story.'' Excitement was not part of the Dukakis game plan. For the third night in a row, the networks panted to find something surprising to say about the proceedings in so controlled a gathering. The current network anchors and their esteemed predecessors were like people trying to make big talk at a big cocktail party.</p>
        <p>The training of news anchors probably includes keeping a straight face when colleagues around you are chattering for the sake of chatter. Even so, it must have been a strain for Peter Jennings to pretend to be absorbed in David Brinkley's list of the good White House speechmakers and the poor ones of the last half century. And could Dan Rather really have been all that fascinated by Walter Cronkite's reflections on how far the Democrats had come since 1948? And how did Tom Brokaw manage to show such interest in John Chancellor's disclosure that Mr. Dukakis was presenting the image of a manager to the nation? I wouldn't be surprised if during commercial breaks they were all sneaking some of those pain relievers.</p>
        <p>It was not the networks' fault; When CBS, NBC and ABC announced that they were holding their coverage of the Democratic National Convention down to two hours in prime time, lamentations were heard over the tendency of television to cut back on news. But after a couple of nights, the question became whether the proceedings were worth even those two allotted hours and whether their being in prime time was an example of deserving programming or just a gesture toward the appearance of virtue. The desultory quality of so much of the coverage offers examples of what sort of events suit television best and what sort do not suit it at all.</p>
        <p>If the glitzmongers had been allowed their way and the Omni Coliseum had been filled with seals waving flags and snoring ''America the Beautiful,'' that would have made terrific television. But on every front the Dukakis forces made it difficult for producers to bring us the color, controversy, conflicts, characters that attract viewers to the tube and hold them there. This was to be a businesslike event, which is not the same as show biz, and ''production values'' were not allowed to bounce out of hand.</p>
        <p>That's the way the Dukakis people wanted it. The primaries had already been unduly stimulating, spreading among television viewers an undesirable impression that the Democratic Party was filled with little fellows who did not trust one another to be President. The impression the Democratic managers were determined to leave this time was that the party is back under control, that it is not the sort of institution that is going to scare anybody about anything, much less self-destruct over some far-out issue like a Palestinian homeland, even if it makes for lively television.</p>
