Bass Group and associated companies, primarily Wall Street firms, had violated requirements of the S.E.C. by failing to notify it that the group had jointly accumulated more than 5 percent of the publishing company's stock.</p>

        <p>LEAD: Macmillan Inc. filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, charging that the Robert M.

        <p>Macmillan Inc. filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday, charging that the Robert M. Bass Group and associated companies, primarily Wall Street firms, had violated requirements of the S.E.C. by failing to notify it that the group had jointly accumulated more than 5 percent of the publishing company's stock.</p>
        <p>Macmillan said the other companies were Shearson Lehman Hutton, American Express, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States, Arcadia Partners L.P., and Wells Fargo Bank. Arcadia, a limited partnership fund, was established in May 1987 by Bass, Equitable, American Express, Shearson and others. A spokesman for the Bass</p>
        <p>Group said he had not yet seen Macmillan's filing but added, ''As described, the charges are completely preposterous.'' Macmillan and the Bass</p>
        <p>Group are locked in a battle for the company's future. Bass bid $64 a share for the company.</p>
        <p>Management countered with a restructuring valued at $64.15.</p>
        <p>Bass then made a $73-a-share all-cash bid and sued to stop the proposed Macmillan restructuring. A judgment is expected next week in Delaware.</p>
