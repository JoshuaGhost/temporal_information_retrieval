        <p>LEAD: In the first verdict of its kind, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights today found the Honduran Government guilty in the disappearance of a Honduran citizen in 1981.</p>
        <p>In the first verdict of its kind, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights today found the Honduran Government guilty in the disappearance of a Honduran citizen in 1981.</p>
        <p>The court, which is an arm of the Organization of American States, ordered Honduras to pay damages to the victim's family. The amount is to be negotiated by the Government and the family within the next six months. The court will oversee the settlement.</p>
        <p>Honduras is one of 10 O.A.S. countries that have recognized the court's jurisdiction, and Honduran lawyers took part in the trial. The verdict of the seven-judge tribunal was unanimous. One judge, Rigoberto Espinal Arias, is a Honduran. Honduran Acceptance</p>
        <p>In a visit to the court's headquarters in 1986, President Jose Azcona Hoyo of Honduras said his Government would accept whatever verdict was reached.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Azcona said today that the Government would respect the ruling. ''The Government of Honduras has no option but to respect the judgment fully,'' said the spokesman, Lisandro Quesada. ''If we have to pay compensation to the family of the disappeared person, it has to be done.''</p>
        <p>''I want to point out in defense of the current Government,'' he added, ''that the disappearance of Velasquez happened in 1981, when General Paz Garcia was President.'' Policarpo Paz Garcia was the military ruler of Honduras until 1982.</p>
        <p>Today marked the first time that the court has issued a direct verdict against a government. One official said it was the first time that a judicial body has condemned a country for human rights violations after the country accepted the body's legitimacy.</p>
        <p>Several O.A.S. members that have been accused of human rights violations, including El Salvador, Nicaragua, Chile and Paraguay, have rejected the court's jurisdiction, as has the United States.</p>
        <p>The court found that the victim in the Honduran case, Angel Manfredo Velasquez Rodriguez, was one of 100 to 150 people abducted in Honduras from 1981 to 1984 as part of ''a policy of disappearances directed or tolerated by the Government.''</p>
        <p>''Manfredo Velasquez was a victim of this practice, and was kidnapped, presumably tortured, executed and buried secretly by agents of the Honduran armed forces,'' the verdict said.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, the Honduran strongman and armed forces chief was Gen. Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, an Argentine-trained officer. General Alvarez, who received military training in the United States, is believed to have introduced the practice of systematically ''disappearing'' Hondurans accused of being threats to security.</p>
        <p>General Alvarez was later deposed, and he fled to the United States. While in office, he closely collaborated with Washington while it was establishing a Honduran network to support the contras in their civil war in Nicaragua.</p>
        <p>The court said there was no evidence that the civilian authorities in Honduras ordered the kidnappings or killings. But it said Government agencies were at fault for not investigating cases that became public. The court made no reference to disappearances or torture in Honduras after 1984.</p>
        <p>Several Latin American countries have engaged in the practice of kidnapping people, often dissidents or government opponents, from the streets or from private homes and torturing them to death in secret military or police stations. Honduras is not accused of carrying out this practice on nearly the scale of Argentina, Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador.</p>
        <p>Human rights groups say 130 people were killed by death squads in Honduras in the early 1980's. Anibal Puerto, the vice president of the Honduran Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, said, ''We hope the ruling will be a warning to the military, and help reduce violations in the future.'' Not Singled Out</p>
        <p>''This verdict has nothing to do with singling out any one country,'' said Thomas Buergenthal, the United States judge on the tribunal. ''We only take up cases that come before us. We aren't saying Honduras is any better or worse than any other country, only that in this one case, certain things happened.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buergenthal, a law professor at Emory University in Atlanta, said the court's verdicts were effective ''because they cannot written off as propaganda from the opposition.''</p>
        <p>''If the countries we find in violation receive economic aid from places where value is placed on preserving human rights, then our verdicts could be of some significance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The human rights court was set up in 1979. It is headed by a Colombian law professor, Rafael Nieto-Navia. In addition to Mr. Nieto-Navia, Mr. Buergenthal and Mr. Espinal Arias, the judges are Hector Gros Espiell of Uruguay, Rodolfo Piza Escalante of Costa Rica, Pedro Nikken of Venezuela and Hector Fix-Zamudio of Mexico.</p>
        <p>A former Honduran agent, Florencio Caballero, told the court that victims were taken to secret jails, where they were tortured in various ways, including with electric shocks.</p>
