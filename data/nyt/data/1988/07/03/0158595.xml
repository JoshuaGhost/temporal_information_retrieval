        <p>LEAD: President Kurt Waldheim withdrew a slander suit on Friday that had been filed against Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, a spokesman said. Last year, Mr. Bronfman called Mr. Waldheim ''part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.''</p>
        <p>President Kurt Waldheim withdrew a slander suit on Friday that had been filed against Edgar M. Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress, a spokesman said. Last year, Mr. Bronfman called Mr. Waldheim ''part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine.''</p>
        <p>The spokesman, Gerold Christian, said that Mr. Waldheim cited three reasons for his move in a letter sent to the Vienna prosecutor's office.</p>
        <p>''First, the U.S. Justice Department has refused legal assistance, which is in contrast to international legal norms,'' and this ruled out a quick court action, Mr. Christian said.</p>
        <p>Second, he said, an international commission of historians, private undertakings and international historians ''have determined Waldheim's personal innocence.''</p>
        <p>''Third, there is an endeavor to contribute to calming down and reconciliation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A report issued by an international commission of historians in February did not say if Mr. Waldheim was involved in wartime atrocities but it said that as an intelligence officer in the German Army, he was aware of them and did nothing to prevent them.</p>
