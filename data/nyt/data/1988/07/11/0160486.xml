        <p>LEAD: The commander of the Chilean Air Force, long known as a critic of President Augusto Pinochet's desire to retain power, says democracy is returning to this country whether General Pinochet wins or loses the coming plebiscite.</p>
        <p>The commander of the Chilean Air Force, long known as a critic of President Augusto Pinochet's desire to retain power, says democracy is returning to this country whether General Pinochet wins or loses the coming plebiscite.</p>
        <p>In a rare interview recently, the commander, Gen. Fernando Matthei, who has headed the air force since 1978, said the choice facing Chilean voters was ''not dictatorship or democracy; either road leads to democracy.''</p>
        <p>He said that if General Pinochet won a new eight-year term, he would retire as army commander and govern as a civilian, accompanied by a Congress to be elected in 1989 and by the increasingly free press.</p>
        <p>If the political opposition defeats General Pinochet, he said, the plebiscite will be followed by competitive presidential elections as promised, as well as the election of Congress and a free press. Differs With Opposition</p>
        <p>''The choice is democracy or democracy,'' he said, differing from the interpretation of the organized opposition, which has adopted the stance that democracy will come only after General Pinochet is defeated.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, General Matthei expressed frustration at the inability of Chileans ''to come out of the trenches and reach a consensus position'' that would allow a less confrontational transition from the 15-year-old rule of the armed forces.</p>
        <p>Discussing the failed attempts at direct negotiations over the last three years, he said, ''At first, the opposition told the armed forces that to talk to them we would have to come with our resignations in hand.''</p>
        <p>Although the armed forces had broad public support when they overturned Salvador Allende Gossens' Socialist-Communist coalition in 1973, he said, ''we have never had the recognition by the opposition parties of the legitimacy of this Government.''</p>
        <p>''During all these years,'' he continued, ''the only option the opposition has planted is that nothing that has been done is valid, and the opposition has still not been able to come down from that tree.''</p>
        <p>But he also said, ''The intransigence comes from both sides.''</p>
        <p>''The Government has not looked for consensus, either,'' he said. ''We have not done our part. Military men are not made for that. It may not be good, but that's the way we are.''</p>
        <p>Although recently ''some politicians have recognized something good of this Government,'' he said, it was probably too late to find the ''consensus candidate'' that he and some other military commanders have often said they were seeking to become a transitional president. Nomination by Armed Forces</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the 1980 Constitution, General Matthei and the commanders of the army, the navy and the national police, including General Pinochet as head of the army, are to unanimously nominate someone to run for an eight-year term in a one-candidate plebiscite late this year. If that candidate loses, open presidential elections are to be called within a year.</p>
        <p>The commanders may nominate anyone, military or civilian, but the candidate is expected to be General Pinochet, who has made known his desire to continue in power and has been campaigning for more than a year. The three other commanders have made clear that they would prefer to nominate someone else, but they do not want an open confrontation with General Pinochet and the army.</p>
        <p>General Matthei did not criticize General Pinochet directly in the interview but noted that all of the military leaders except General Pinochet were ready to get out of politics.</p>
        <p>''I have no political interest or ambition,'' he said, ''The President yes, the rest of us no.'' General May Retire</p>
        <p>General Matthei, at the age of 62 a decade younger than General Pinochet, said that if the military-nominated candidate won the plebiscite, he intended to retire as air force commander after the inauguration March 11. If the opposition wins, he said, he would probably remain as commander until March 1990, by which time the presidential and congressional elections would have been held.</p>
        <p>The four-man military junta, which performs legislative functions, is supposed to disappear in March 1990.</p>
        <p>General Matthei said the military leadership was going ahead with the plebiscite despite the fact that current polls give no assurance of victory to either side. That raises a risk he said he did not like - that the defeat of General Pinochet would look like a rejection of all the armed forces.</p>
        <p>He said the main accomplishment of the military leadership had been to return ''economic and social liberty'' to Chile after the Allende Government's attempts to put the state in control of most of the economy. ''Now,'' he said, ''we want to return political liberty.'' Economic Successes Cited</p>
        <p>He cited successes of the free-market economy - with high growth and rapidly expanding exports - after tough periods in which many people lost their jobs. He said the armed forces had taken a country that was ''really bankrupt in every way'' and made it into ''a country that works.''</p>
        <p>While many critics have accused Chile's leadership of ignoring the poor and merely improving the situation of the affluent, he contended that it had created an ''impersonal economy'' in which the old landed families and industrialists long accustomed to subsidies and tariff protection were forced to become competitive or go out of business.</p>
        <p>He said the oil and foreign debt crises had made it crucial for Chile to become an aggressive trading nation. He said the days were gone when the Government ''could commit whatever economic foolishness and copper would always pay the bill.''</p>
        <p>''If the politicians win big in the plebiscite and try to change what we have accomplished with the economy,'' he said, ''the people will soon realize which was the better government.''</p>
