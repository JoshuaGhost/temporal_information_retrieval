        <p>LEAD: The transcript of radio calls between the downed Iran Air jetliner and air controllers appears to support Iran's assertion that the plane was sending out normal radar signals for a civilian aircraft and was climbing from 12,000 feet to its assigned altitude of 14,000 feet when it was shot down by the United States</p>

        <p>LEAD: The transcript of radio calls between the downed Iran Air jetliner and air controllers appears to support Iran's assertion that the plane was sending out normal radar signals for a civilian aircraft and was climbing from 12,000 feet to its assigned altitude of 14,000 feet when it was shot down by the United States</p>
        <p>The transcript of radio calls between the downed Iran Air jetliner and air controllers appears to support Iran's assertion that the plane was sending out normal radar signals for a civilian aircraft and was climbing from 12,000 feet to its assigned altitude of 14,000 feet when it was shot down by the United States Navy.</p>
        <p>The transcript also shows that the pilots of Flight 655 talked with three different controllers on three different frequencies in the seven minutes from takeoff to the time it was shot down, suggesting that the pilots were unlikely to have been monitoring a separate emergency frequency on which the Pentagon said warnings were issued. Standard Information for a Civil Flight</p>
        <p>The information exchanged was standard for civil flights: headings, temperatures, altitudes and checkpoints, punctuated by the succinct politeness of airline pilots the world over. The transcript was in English, the language pilots and controllers use worldwide for standard radio communication. It was made public yesterday by Iran's Foreign Minister, Dr. Ali Akbar Velayati, at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>After Flight 655's pilot radioed the tower in Bandar Abbas, Iran, for permission to begin to taxi, the tower controller passed on the request to Teheran, where flight controllers talked with their counterparts in the United Arab Emirates. Dubai agreed to the altitude assignment of 14,000 feet and the code for the transponder, which planes uses to enhance radar signals, and passed back along the chain to the pilot. Transponder Code Was Confirmed</p>
        <p>The four-digit transponder code assigned to each flight makes the radar echo display information unique to that flight. As is routine, the transponder command, ''Squawk 6760,'' was confirmed each step of the way from three sets of controllers to the pilot.</p>
        <p>The tower controller in Bandar Abbas double-checked the code after the pilot's confirmation call, saying: ''Squawk 6760 read back is correct. Call when ready for takeoff.'' That was just after 10:10 A.M. local time - or 10:40 A.M. in Dubai, which has a half-hour time difference with Iran. That confirmation call was made 7 minutes before the plane took off and 14 minutes before it was shot down.</p>
        <p>The tower controller in Bandar Abbas ended his call with, ''Have a nice day.'' Flight 655's pilot confirmed the clearance and radioed back: ''Thank you very much. Good day.''</p>
        <p>In the seven minutes after takeoff, during which the Pentagon said the Vincennes issued seven radio warnings on military and civilian emergency frequencies, the pilots made the routine switch from the tower frequency to the next set of controllers who monitor the airspace near the Bandar Abbas airport and then to the controllers in Teheran who direct planes outside airport areas.</p>
        <p>In the seven calls to these two controllers, Flight 655 pilots reported climbing through three different altitudes - 3,500 feet, 7,000 feet and 12,000 feet. The Vincennes reported that the plane was between 7,000 and 9,000 feet and descending. The Final Words With Teheran</p>
        <p>According to the transcript, the jet's last position report was to the approach controller at 10:54, the moment the Vincennes fired two missiles at the jetliner. The pilots were calling in from a checkpoint named Mobet, about 10 miles from the Vincennes. Confirming the position, the controller said: ''IR 655. Roger. Contact Teheran control, 133.4. Have a nice day.''</p>
        <p>Flight 655's last words: ''Thank you. Good day.''</p>
