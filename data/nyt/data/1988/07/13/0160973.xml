        <p>LEAD: President Reagan formally selected Dick Thornburgh, a former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania, today as his new Attorney General, and lawmakers from both parties praised the choice and predicted quick confirmation by the Senate.</p>
        <p>President Reagan formally selected Dick Thornburgh, a former Republican Governor of Pennsylvania, today as his new Attorney General, and lawmakers from both parties praised the choice and predicted quick confirmation by the Senate.</p>
        <p>Summing up Mr. Thornburgh's qualifications, one senior White House official said today: ''He's clean and confirmable.''</p>
        <p>According to senior White House officials, the President rejected the advice of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d. Mr. Meese had recommended his successor be Donald P. Hodel, the Secretary of the Interior and a favorite with conservative activists, the officials said. Political Target Not Wanted</p>
        <p>More moderate forces within the White House, who backed Mr. Thornburgh, won the day by arguing that the nominee should be a noncontroversial figure who would provide little ammunition for Democrats in the Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meese announced last week that he would leave his post by early August, saying it was time to leave the Government because he had been vindicated in a report by a special prosecutor, James McKay, who had investigated his dealings.</p>
        <p>Asked at a news conference if he wanted to be an Attorney General ''in the tradition of Ed Meese,'' the nominee replied, ''I'll be an Attorney General in the tradition of Dick Thornburgh.''</p>
        <p>Asked his opinion of the Attorney General, Mr. Thornburgh said, ''I think it's important to look forward rather than look back.'' 'Greatest Respect' From Kennedy</p>
        <p>Democrats generally agreed with the assessment that Mr. Thornburgh would easily be confirmed. Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a leading liberal voice on the Judiciary Committee, which will review the nomination, said he had the ''greatest respect'' for Mr. Thornburgh, who headed the criminal division of the Justice Department in the Ford Administration.</p>
        <p>''The state of justice in America would be very different today if Dick Thornburgh had been Attorney General for the past three and a half years instead of Ed Meese,'' Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thornburgh, who will turn 56 on Saturday, was United States Attorney for Western Pennsylvania in the early 1970's and made a reputation as a ''Mr. Clean'' figure by prosecuting organized crime and political corruption.</p>
        <p>He was elected Governor in 1978 and concentrated on such issues as economic growth and the transition to a post-industrial economy.</p>
        <p>He received high marks for steady leadership in 1979, when the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island threatened to contaminate communities in central Pennsylvania.</p>
        <p>But critics argue that he did not do enough to cushion the impact of the collapse of the steel industry in the state and that he could be insensitive to the needs of the poor.</p>
        <p>One report during his re-election campaign in 1982 said he told a welfare mother who complained about not finding a job: ''Things are tough all over.''</p>
        <p>As Governor, he cut the state budget. Since he left office, critics have complained that the cuts many impaired many services.</p>
        <p>When he left office in 1987, he returned to private law practice and taught at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>He considered running in the Republican primary against Senator Arlen Spector two years ago and has been mentioned as a possible running mate for Vice President Bush. He turned down the chance to become head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation last year. 'Crime Buster'</p>
        <p>Given the troubles of Mr. Meese, the choice of his successor echoed with political implications. And in announcing the selection of Mr. Thornburgh today, the President called him a ''tough-minded crime buster'' and stressed many issues that loom large in the campaign, from drugs and the death penalty to ''big spending and high taxes.''</p>
        <p>To pragmatists in the White House, Mr. Thornburgh's biggest recommendation was that he differed from Mr. Meese in two key respects: He does not take an ideological approach to many issues that concern conservatives, and he has a strong reputation for integrity.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, they reasoned, when Mr. Thornburgh comes up for his confirmation hearings, Democrats will not be able to use the occasion to attack the Administration for its support of the ''so-called Meese agenda,'' as one official put it. That agenda, he added, includes such politically unpopular stands as opposition to many civil rights laws and to the legalization of abortion.</p>
        <p>Asked today whether he would follow up the special prosecutor's report, Mr. Thornburgh replied: ''My intention - and this is in any area - is to follow the evidence wherever it may lead.''</p>
        <p>The most strident criticism of the selection came from conservatives, particularly those who differ with him on abortion. Senator Gordon J. Humphrey, Republican of New Hampshire, issued a statement expressing his ''bitter disappointment'' at the choice, saying that Mr. Thornburgh had ''opposed right-to-life legislation'' while Governor.</p>
