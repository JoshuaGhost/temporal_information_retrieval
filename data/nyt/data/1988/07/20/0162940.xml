        <p>Alain Chevrier, who started last season as the No. 1 goaltender for the Devils, will be starting this one with the Winnipeg Jets. In a trade yesterday, the Devils sent Chevrier and their 1989 seventh-round draft choice to Winnipeg for Steve Rooney, a left wing, and a fourth-round draft pick in 1989. The trade should give Chevrier more playing time, because he had fallen behind Sean Burke and Bob Sauve in the goalie numbers game with the Devils. Last season, Chevrier, 27 years old, appeared in 45 games, had one shutout in an 18-19-3 won-lost-tied record and allowed an average of 3.77 goals. He did not play in the Devils' playoff run to the Stanley Cup semifinals. Rooney, 26, scored 7 goals and 6 assists in 56 games last season. He accumulated 217 minutes in the penalty box, and gives the Devils an aggressive wing, as well as adding depth to the forward position. . . . The Rangers have signed Mark Tinordi, a 22-year-old defenseman who split last season between the parent club and their Colorado affiliate International Hockey League. No details of the contract were announced.</p>
