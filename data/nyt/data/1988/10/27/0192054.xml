        <p>LEAD: The prime reason Vice President Bush is running ahead of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the polls is that he has taken stands on a wide range of national issues that a majority of the American people support and believe in. It's that simple. If you don't believe this, let's try a game of ''what if.''</p>

        <p>LEAD: The prime reason Vice President Bush is running ahead of Gov. Michael S.

        <p>The prime reason Vice President Bush is running ahead of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in the polls is that he has taken stands on a wide range of national issues that a majority of the American people support and believe in. It's that simple. If you don't believe this, let's try a game of ''what if.''</p>
        <p>What if we swapped issues and candidates? What if we left everything else the same - the candidates' personality, their height, their campaign staffs, the professionalism of their television ads, their debating skills -and gave George Bush the party registration and policy positions of Michael Dukakis, and Michael Dukakis the party registration and policy positions of George Bush?</p>
        <p>Imagine that George Bush is a Democrat. He refuses to rule out a tax increase and we know he secretly believes we must and will raise tax rates, especially on the rich, as soon as we can. He is against a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. He wants national health insurance and is willing to force most employers to pay for it. He thinks the idea of a protective missile defense system is silly and wants to sharply cut its funding. He is opposed to the MX missile. He thinks we are spending too much on national defense. While he approves of nuclear arms reduction, he sees no connection between the Soviet Union's agreement to destroy nuclear missiles and our increasing spending on defense and Star Wars.</p>
        <p>He is against the death penalty, even for extremely violent, cruel crimes. He has always been for gun control. Every since his college days at Swarthmore when he wrote a piece for the college newspaper titled ''Fuzzy-Head Liberal Crashes National Rally for McCarthy,'' he has been a sincere left-wing liberal Democrat, a true believer. He is a member of American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
        <p>Now imagine that Michael S. Dukakis is a Republican. He has strongly and repeatedly ruled out any tax rate increase (''read my lips''), and has even gone so far as to propose a major cut in the capital gains tax rate. He supports a balanced budget amendment. He is opposed to having the Federal Government mandate compulsory health insurance for most private businesses. He strongly supports Star Wars and is pledged to begin deploying it as soon as even part of it is ready and working. He wants to build the MX nuclear missile. He believes we must continue to increase spending for national defense. He believes that bilateral nuclear disarmament between the United States and the Soviet Union is dependent on a strong defense and Star Wars.</p>
        <p>For certain brutal crimes he believes the death penalty is just and that it helps deter crime. He is a conservative Republican, especially on national security and economic policy and was once the national chairman of his party. He believes the A.C.L.U. has a left-wing political agenda, and would never think of joining the organization. He is a life member of the National Rifle Association and opposes any more gun control.</p>
        <p>If we could pull off such a policy switch and communicate it to every potential voter, it is a virtual certainly that the national public opinion polls would turn around within 48 hours.</p>
        <p>Instead of George Bush leading Michael Dukakis by 10 to 15 points, Michael Dukakis, the ''Republican,'' would be leading George Bush, the ''Democrat,'' by 10 to 15 points.</p>
        <p>The 1988 Presidential campaign will be determined, as always, by the big policy issues - national security and economic policy.</p>
        <p>If the Democrats, with two smart, very competent, articulate, even likable men such as Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen, get trounced by George Bush and Dan Quayle, then with whom do they expect to win?</p>
        <p>The problem the Democrats are having this year is not with their Presidential candidate but with their message.</p>
        <p>The left-liberal policy agenda is a lead sinker in modern American politics. Until and unless the Democrats jettison that lead sinker, the Republicans will continue to win the Presidency.</p>
