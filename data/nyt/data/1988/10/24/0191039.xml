        <p>LEAD: The Greek Government, with the assistance of American marketing experts, has begun an ambitious export program designed to make ''Made in Greece'' a household label in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Greek Government, with the assistance of American marketing experts, has begun an ambitious export program designed to make ''Made in Greece'' a household label in the United States.</p>
        <p>The program involves setting up consortiums in the United States that will be assigned the goal of developing a tenfold increase in seven major categories of Greek exports. Products from these industries now represent one-fifth of Greece's total of $567 million in exports to the United States. $1.5 Billion Goal Many Greek products - particularly wine, olive oil, canned fruit and marble - enter the United States under the labels of other countries, which exploit their low prices and the Greeks' inability to market them. The Greek Government, planning to discourage what it views as pirating, hopes exports to the United States will reach $1.5 billion by 1991. All Greek products will have a specially designed logotype saying ''Made in Greece.''</p>
        <p>The Greek effort, under the direction of Minister of Commerce Nikos Akritidis, began last year when the state-run Hellenic Export Promotion Organization hired Greycom International, a New York-based international relations and marketing concern, under a two-year contract. Together, they identified the seven categories best suited for promotion in the American market: footwear, ready-to-wear clothes, food, wine, marble, jewelry and furs. Contracts Assuring Quality</p>
        <p>Greycom evaluated Greek manufacturers' export capabilities and examined potential United States markets. On the Greek side, the Hellenic promotion group is signing contracts with Greek manufacturers that will insure that they meet quality standards and produce certain amounts.</p>
        <p>In the United States, a consortium of companies representing each sector will soon be established in New York. Traveling salesmen, primarily Americans, will be used. All orders will be placed through the consortium; previously, Greek manufacturers traveled individually to the United States with samples to find interested buyers.</p>
        <p>''This is the first-ever operation of this dimension,'' said Constantine Frantzis, who heads the Hellenic organization. ''In the past, we have had many disappointments with the United States market, but the Americans have also been disappointed with us because we could not meet their expectations. We never had a specific program. Under this plan, we will try to guarantee design and quality not in accordance with our own tastes, but according to the demands of the American consumer.'' Europe Is Main Customer</p>
        <p>Greece's entrance into the European Community in 1981 made it easier for Greek exporters to sell their products to Europe. In 1987, 70 percent of Greek exports went to members of the European Community; 11 percent went to the United States.</p>
        <p>Alan Parter and Suzanne Harvey, who are Greycom executives, said that Greece's poor relations with the United States and the anti-Americanism prevailing here had dampened the interest of American importers in the past. But they said that they expected the problem to be overcome by the general improvement in American-Greek relations.</p>
        <p>Leonidas Tsinivides, the president of the Greek Shoe Manufacturers, is at the forefront of the effort. Greek shoes head the list of products being promoted by the new venture.</p>
        <p>''At one stage, Greek shoes nearly dominated the American market,'' he said. ''Then we went through a stage where they were exported anonymously, in the sense that they went under foreign brand names. Now, we are almost starting from scratch again. But we are optimistic because it is the first time that we have so much support from the state and such close cooperation with American experts.''  INTERNATIONAL REPORT</p>
