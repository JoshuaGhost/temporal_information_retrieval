        <p>LEAD: You may have been to a few movies that seemed 40 hours long. Now you can see one that really is. It's called ''Five Year Diary,'' and it took seven years to make. It takes eight days to show. And it has its premiere Friday at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens.</p>

        <p>LEAD: You may have been to a few movies that seemed 40 hours long. Now you can see one that really is. It's called ''Five Year Diary,'' and it took seven years to make.

        <p>You may have been to a few movies that seemed 40 hours long. Now you can see one that really is. It's called ''Five Year Diary,'' and it took seven years to make. It takes eight days to show. And it has its premiere Friday at the American Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens.</p>
        <p>Oh, you think anyone who has the effrontery to make such an epic should be forced to watch it? Actually, the moviemaker does more than watch: she's also the projectionist.</p>
        <p>Anne Robertson, a film maker and performance artist who was star, director, crew and all-around auteur for her own filmed diary, will be present during the entire showing.</p>
        <p>''I'll be sipping from a cup of coffee to keep my throat from drying up,'' she said. That's because she'll be performing live voice-over narration, reading from her written diaries and interacting with her filmed image. A Museum 'Centerpiece'</p>
        <p>''Five Year Diary'' is one of the longest films ever shown in the city, and appears as part of the museum's new 150-film series, ''Independent America: New Film 1978-1988.'' Ms. Robertson's highly personal super-8 extravaganza is ''our centerpiece,'' said David Schwartz, the curator of the series.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robertson's work will be shown in half-hour segments allowing audience members to enter and exit when they wish, and she hopes that viewers will not be intimidated by so long a work.</p>
        <p>''It's very approachable - it's very home movie-ish, underexposed, overexposed, jerky camera - all of the things that characterize a home movie,'' said the 39-year-old Ms. Robertson, who lives in Framingham, Mass. A Continuing Process</p>
        <p>Actually, her five-year diary, dating from Nov. 3, 1981, ''is now seven years old,'' Ms. Robertson said. ''When I got to the five-year mark in 1986, I kept going because, basically, I didn't have a happy ending for my movie.''</p>
        <p>''Five Year Diary'' will be shown beginning Friday starting at 2 P.M. in the museum, at 35th Avenue and 36th Street. The film will be shown through Sunday, and again Wednesday through Sunday, Oct. 26 through 30.</p>
        <p>Ms. Robertson intends never to stop filming ''Five Year Diary.'' ''What I'd like,'' she said, ''is to be at the end of my life, holding a camera in my hand, and when I die, well, that would be the last minute of the film.''</p>
