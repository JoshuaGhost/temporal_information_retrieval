        <p>EVA LUNA  By Isabel Allende.  Translated by Margaret Sayers Peden.  272 pp. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. $18.95.</p>
        <p>The heroine of this confessional saga has a ''God-given talent for telling stories,'' yet finds fame and redemption writing the melodramatic potboilers called telenovelistas. The trouble with Eva Luna is that this plot seems plausible only as an unwitting confession about the career of its author. Isabel Allende brings to her third novel the same qualities that have won her a popular following: an evident affection for words, compassion for the oppressed and the inarticulate, the daring ambition to draw cross-sections of whole societies and a nearly maternal approach to narrative that bathes characters in a warm, milky light. Here, she has also yielded to her worst tendencies: sentimentality, pat judgments and the need to cram her tale with so many operatic crescendos that one can't help nodding when a voice in the book encourages her, ''Keep writing, Eva, I'm curious about how you're going to end such a mishmash.''</p>
        <p>Our rich (in spirit) little poor girl comes into the world as the outcome of a servant girl's impulse to provide final comfort and sexual sacraments to an Indian dying of snakebite. Despite her origins, Eva Luna's most consistent characteristic is her lack of venom. She accepts her various rough fates with little more than an occasional sigh of, ''Enough, enough!'' When times really get tough, she snarls such jewels of peasant wisdom as, ''Life is a dogfight.''</p>
        <p>Her second madrina is a wily African who gets disqualified from surrogate motherhood after she herself gives birth to a two-headed monster. While wandering the streets, our telepathic urchin develops a childhood crush on the future commandante of her unnamed nation's guerrilla army. Eva is just commencing her apprenticeship in a brothel when she's rescued by a kindly Arab storekeeper with a harelip and a two-timing Scheherazade of a wife - whose suicide causes him to be falsely charged with murder. Under the guidance of a stunning transsexual actress, Eva suddenly ascends to literacy and respectability. While content to tryst with her macho Adam of a guerilla leader, she is not entirely immune to the charms of a German emigre investigative reporter or the top dog colonel of the local bad-guy guardia. She is wooed, despite stated misgivings about killing for the cause, into helping her first love stage a daring rescue of political prisoners. Other than that, things are pretty quiet around the house for Eva.</p>
        <p>Latin America is a place that even Latin Americans find unimaginable. This is a muddy historical and spiritual terrain in which the lines have been blurred between things done, things left undone, things that should never have been done and things that still need doing. If that's Isabel Allende's point, then it's been made better before. And while this liberating perspective served to lift the veil from an entire continent, it has now become a stereotype that can only obscure. After so many half-dreamt tales akin to ''Eva Luna,'' the time may have come for a swing back to a more mundane sort of storytelling. At this point, the most fantastical Latin Americans may be those who commute each morning to office jobs, worry about their car payments, follow the ball scores and the latest gringo fashions and manage somehow to get through life without spinning daydreams or placating Yoruba gods.</p>
        <p>Few of the cast of characters emerge as distinctive or entirely believable. Too often, we find Eva Luna's compatriots revealed through generalized attributions rather than their own actions. The dialogue rarely rises above the level of these dying words of Eva's mother: ''There is no death, daughter. People die only when we forget them . . . If you can remember me, I will be with you always.'' A feminist viewpoint is expressed largely through grumblings about how ''men had it best,'' which seems to be forgotten by the next swoon. And if Eva Luna is meant to be some sort of Hispanic Cinderella, then she is one who dwells on the callouses caused by her slipper. What's missing from this portrait of a survivor is the one tool for survival that's evident even to passing observers of the Latin American scene: namely, the street culture's irreverent, insouciant humor, which manages to turn the most bitter moments into sweet triumphs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Allende's work glows with the enthusiasm of a relative late-comer to the literary game. Perhaps it's for this same reason that she sometimes revels in a hackneyed phrase as though she were the first writer ever to stumble on it. For instance, on lovers: ''Together we entered a private place where time did not exist.'' On the soldier for the people: ''Huberto Naranjo was becoming one more animal in the jungle. . . . The machete and rifle fused to his hands, natural extensions of his arms.'' On Middle Eastern lovemaking: ''Then he surrendered himself, eyes closed, while she caressed him until he seemed near death: finally she swung astride him, smothering him with her voluptuousness and the wealth of her hair, completely obliterating him, absorbing him in her quicksands, devouring him, draining him, and leading him to the gardens of Allah where he was celebrated by all the odalisques of the Prophet.''</p>
        <p>Is this magic realism a la Garcia Marquez or Hollywood magic a la Judith Krantz? We can only marvel at how thin the line becomes between the two, and give Ms. Allende the benefit of the doubt. She is a popularizer who performs a valuable service by making general audiences aware of the rich milieu and timeless fatalism captured by prior practitioners of the new Latin American fiction. In her books, genuine mystical vision is replaced by the incessant consulting of tarot cards; that ''smell of rotting guava,'' which Gabriel Garcia Marquez has called the essence of the tropics, is reduced to a whiff of the jungle and a few sachets.</p>
        <p>As for our ultimately unarchetypal Eva, she is spared an expulsion from her intrigue-filled Garden of Eden. We leave her in the arms of ''an exceptional love, a love I did not have to invent, only clothe in all its glory so it could endure in memory.'' Ms. Allende is forced to concede that everything wraps up ''exactly as it happens in romantic novels.'' A bit too exactly. This ending is happy enough to satisfy the most lovelorn readers, a happy ending that has as little to do with the Latin American poor as the rest of ''Eva Luna.''</p>
