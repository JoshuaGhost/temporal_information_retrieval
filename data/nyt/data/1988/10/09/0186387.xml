        <p>LEAD: What went down has come up. The size and lavishness of single- family homes, which shrank considerably between 1978 and 1982, are on the rise, with sizes and prices having set records in 1987.</p>
        <p>What went down has come up. The size and lavishness of single- family homes, which shrank considerably between 1978 and 1982, are on the rise, with sizes and prices having set records in 1987.</p>
        <p>According to the Census Bureau, the median size of the single-family homes built in 1987 was 1,755 square feet, up 95 square feet from the 1986 median of 1,660. The median size bottomed out in 1982 at 1,520 square feet, after a downward slide from 1,660 square feet in 1978. Prices have soared as well - to a median of $104,000 for a new home in 1987, compared with $92,000 in 1986. And the trend continues. For the second quarter of 1988, the median price was up again, to $112,400. This is about double the 1978 median of $55,700.  The bad news is already familiar to people buying their first homes. Mushrooming costs of land and development are inflating prices beyond the pocketbooks of many young families, according to the National Association of Home Builders.</p>
        <p>''Consequently,'' noted Dale Stuard, the association's president, ''older homes in need of repair, or located in borderline neighborhoods, or new housing built in exurbia where land costs are cheaper are about the only options.''</p>
        <p>The reason for larger, more elaborate houses, Mr. Stuard said, is that the first wave of baby boomers, now over 40 years old, is old enough and therefore affluent enough to demand homes ''loaded with all the comforts of modern day living.''</p>
        <p>Steady increases in the percentage of homes with four or more bedrooms, one or more fireplaces, two-and-a-half or more bathrooms and two-car garages were cited in the survey.</p>
        <p>Twenty-three percent of new 1987 homes had four or more bedrooms, up from 20 percent in 1986, and 83 percent had two or more bathrooms, up from 80 percent in 1986.</p>
