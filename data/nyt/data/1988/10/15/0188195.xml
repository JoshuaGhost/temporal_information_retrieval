        <p>Two Palestinians wounded in clashes with troops in the occupied West Bank died today, Arabs and hospital officials said.</p>
        <p>Palestinians said one of the victims, Omar al-Assi, 21 years old, was dead on arrival at a Jerusalem hospital. They said he had been shot by soldiers dispersing a demonstration in the village of Kufr Malek, near Ramallah.</p>
        <p>The second man, Ahmad Alarja, 19, died today after being shot in the head last week by troops who fired at demonstrators throwing stones in Ramallah, Palestinians said. Mr. Alarja was from the village of Qibya.</p>
        <p>An army spokeswoman said she had no report of the deaths, but the army often does not learn of deaths in Arab hospitals until days later. The deaths today bring the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began last December to at least 262.  Beirut Bomb Kills Syrian Soldier</p>
