        <p>Imagine a once-serviceable red brick public school now boarded up and dilapidated. Then imagine, on the same two-acre site, small clusters of single-family town houses, neat lawns, shrubs and flowers.</p>
        <p>Many residents of Yonkers, N.Y., apparently would rather keep the rundown, useless school building. They say court-ordered housing integration threatens their property values. Yet to see the sites is to see that such housing would almost surely enhance their value and their neighborhoods. A trip to scatter-site housing in the neighboring town of Greenburgh confirms the point.</p>
        <p>The 200 units of low-income housing that are the source of controversy in Yonkers are to be scattered on seven sites, with no site containing more than 48 single-family dwellings. ''Scattered-site public housing that by design, scale and density is not intrusive in the neighborhood does not bring down property values,'' says Lawrence Salley of Westchester County's planning department.</p>
        <p>Six sites have already been designated and final agreement on the seventh is expected this week. The two-acre site of the abandoned school would contain 28 two- and three-bedroom units. In addition, a public playground across the street would be improved, benefiting all the neighborhood's children.</p>
        <p>Several blocks away is a corner parking lot where shrubbery encroaches on the pavement. The proposed substitution of 20 two-bedroom units would remove an eyesore from the neighborhood of modest single-family homes. Another site faces Tibbetts Brook</p>
        <p>County Park. Residents of the homes that line one street now look out on overgrown woods sloping down a steep hill behind Lincoln High School. On this site, houses would be surrounded by trees. An existing street would be extended to give old and new residents better access to a nearby shopping area and other community facilities.</p>
        <p>A similar site near the Cross County Parkway was once a wooded estate dotted with huge boulders. It sits across from multifamily low-rise apartment buildings. One border of the estate has become an unsightly parking lot and dump. The housing plan contemplates retaining much of the woods and dispersing housing among the boulders.</p>
        <p>The Whitman School stands by a lovely roadway near Crestwood Lake. The roadway is lined with low-rise brick apartment buildings but the empty, rundown school building and some nearby concrete storage vaults blight the landscape. Residential development on this site would revitalize the school as a community resource.</p>
        <p>These sites give evidence that well-managed low-rise, low-income housing would be a blessing. There's every reason for Yonkers to stop treating it as a curse.  Tomorrow: The View from Greenburgh</p>
