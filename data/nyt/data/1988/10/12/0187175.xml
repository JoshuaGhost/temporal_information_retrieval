        <p>LEAD: FINALLY, after television mini-series on police officers, doctors and lawyers, there will be one on the advertising business.</p>
        <p>FINALLY, after television mini-series on police officers, doctors and lawyers, there will be one on the advertising business.</p>
        <p>''Campaign,'' a six-week mini-series that begins Saturday on the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable network, may stir the senses but it probably won't please Madison Avenue moralists. Promotional material for the series, a product of the British Broadcasting Company, describes the principals as ''ruthless and scandal prone.''</p>
        <p>The North American premiere of ''Campaign'' is timed to the national election in the United States, but the plot centers on how a British advertising agency, Hamilton, Forbes &amp; Kent, vies for the assignment of helping the Prime Minister's bid for re-election.</p>
        <p>The central character is Sarah Copeland, the agency's ad director, played by Penny Downie, who struggles with marriage, children and career. Jeremy Clyde, an English pop singer, is the co-star.</p>
        <p>Arts &amp; Entertainment describes the story this way: ''Tensions are running high at Hamilton, Forbes &amp; Kent. The Government is about to call a general election and the agency is hoping to win the account. But David Postgate, the managing director, is in New York negotiating the purchase of another agency, and in his absence his oily deputy and rival, Gordon Lockhead, is plotting his downfall.</p>
        <p>''Sarah Copeland, the firm's creative director, is frantically trying to juggle board room politics with launching the new campaign, while at home her husband, Paul, has just walked out, leaving her alone to cope with their 7-year old son, Daniel. . . .''</p>
        <p>Is the story based on an actual situation or ad agency? Andrew Orgel, the cable network's senior vice president of programming, insists that it is ''entirely fictional.'' However, it might be noted that Saatchi and Saatchi, a British advertising company that has expanded aggresively in the United States, made its first reputation from the political advertising it created for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orgel noted that the network had previously broadcast a movie, 'Honest, Decent and True,' that involved the advertising business. ''But so far as we know, this is the first mini-series on the subject,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many people in the advertising business may find the issues raised and the shenanigans depicted in the series disturbing. Among the attitudes and actions ''Campaign'' depicts, Mr. Orgel says, are: ''Principles mean nothing, but winning is all. Deceptive advertising is allowed. Even the Government which employs the agency to help re-elect the Prime Minister knows that the agency is deceiving the public on the Minister's abilities.''</p>
        <p>''Campaign'' will be broadcast at 10 P.M. for six consecutive Saturdays.</p>
