        <p>LEAD: To The Editor:</p>
        <p>To The Editor:</p>
        <p>Sound the alarm! Orchestral musicians, to arms! Our musical future is a dead end. Or so Times music critics would have us believe. Since articles about the death of the symphony orchestra are appearing more frequently and more convincing, I am compelled to respond.</p>
        <p>The future of the symphony orchestra is threatened, as it always has been. Yet we should remember that the symphony orchestra came into being because there was a need for it. It may go out of existence because the need for it is disappearing.</p>
        <p>How many composers today need the symphony orchestra? Not many. If computer renditions of Beethoven symphonies and Brandenburg Concertos surpass the quality (and the cost) of live performances, audiences will not need it. The recording industry will not need it. Only conservatory students (the ''Juilliard kids'') will need it - but that will not be because we blindly put all our eggs in one basket.</p>
        <p>We will need the symphony orchestra, as we do now, because we are not content to be passive receivers of music. There will always be people who need the physical, emotional and spiritual act of performing music to make their lives richer.</p>
        <p>Where do we fit into the critics' predictions? Perhaps we are musically irrelevant. John Rockwell warns us that as classical music ''recedes more. . .into the past'' musicians lose ''any direct cultural connection to that tradition.'' And we have - just as he has. But we will find a new impetus for a new performing tradition when the same classical music is played and recorded in a way superior to current means. It may be even sooner than we think.</p>
        <p>The computer will very likely out-play many of us (and musically, too), but does that mean we young people will simply stop playing orchestral music? Will we only play mainstream popular music? No way!</p>
        <p>If the critics had taken into account the fact that musicians need classical music, they would have known that the replacement of the symphony orchestra by superior computer performances will eventually inspire many more people to play the violin or the cello, just as superior performances and recordings in recent times have inspired us to make musical activity our life's work. The only difference will be that the standards for orchestral performance will be much higher - hardly an unsettling prospect, and certainly not the death knell of the symphony orchestra.</p>
        <p>So, instead of fearing for our security, musicians and critics should welcome the inevitable computerization of Mozart and Brahms. For if it really will be more beautiful music, it will not be a threat to human performers, but an inspiration to us.  PAUL H. SMITH  Music Director  Senior String Orchestra of Greater Boston</p>
