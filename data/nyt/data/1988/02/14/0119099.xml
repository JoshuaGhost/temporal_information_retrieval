        <p>LEAD: Problems with the heat-resistant material that protects the nozzles of the space shuttle's booster rocket should be corrected before the next shuttle flight scheduled for August, according to an internal report being reviewed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>Problems with the heat-resistant material that protects the nozzles of the space shuttle's booster rocket should be corrected before the next shuttle flight scheduled for August, according to an internal report being reviewed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
        <p>The recommendations in the 240-page study were reported in the Sunday editions of The Washington Post, which said the problems were not thought to be potentially catastrophic. Concerns of NASA officials were said to be alleviated somewhat by two recent tests in which the material performed in a manner considered normal for flight.</p>
        <p>The report suggested several steps that might be taken to enhance the durability of the carbon material used to line the nozzle cones, situated at the base of the booster rockets. The cones, 12 feet in diameter, direct the rocket's exhaust and help it achieve liftoff.</p>
        <p>A senior NASA spokesman, when asked about the report tonight, said that evaluations of a wide variety of shuttle components are routinely performed, but declined to comment on the significance on the report described in The Post.</p>
        <p>The problems emerged in tests of the inch-thick, heat-resistant material, which, the report said, experienced fractures ''so numerous, so large, so closely spaced and so extensive'' that the strength of the cone ''came into question.''</p>
        <p>Engineers studying the erosion of the material disagreed about the severity of the problem, the newspaper said. Four of the six who studied the material said the substance used to line the exhaust cones might perform marginally, two other questioned the validity of the study tests.</p>
        <p>Difficulties with the nozzles of the space shuttle's solid-fuel booster rockets have caused problems before that have delayed the next shuttle flight until Aug. 4, when Discovery is scheduled to be launched. It will be the first flight since January 1986, when the space shuttle Challenger exploded shortly after liftoff, killing the seven astronauts aboard.</p>
