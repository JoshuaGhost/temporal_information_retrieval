        <p>LEAD: Two men believed to have been homeless were found dead on Manhattan streets during the weekend, and a third was found dead in a field on Wards Island as temperatures plunged to the lowest point in three weeks, the authorities said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Two men believed to have been homeless were found dead on Manhattan streets during the weekend, and a third was found dead in a field on Wards Island as temperatures plunged to the lowest point in three weeks, the authorities said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The police could not say for certain whether the deaths were related to the cold because autopsy reports had not been completed. However, foul play was not immediately suspected in the deaths, said a police spokesman, Sgt. John Venetucci.  The temperature in Central Park dropped to 9 degrees yesterday morning, making it the coldest day in New York City since Jan. 15, when the temperature fell to 5 degrees, said Gene Salerno, a meterologist with the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>During more than a week of bitter cold in mid-January, at least six people, three of them homeless, were found frozen to death in the city.</p>
        <p>With the onset of warmer southwesterly winds today, ''It's still going to be cold but we won't be talking about 9 degrees anymore,'' Mr. Salerno said. Temperatures should reach the 30's today, and were not expected to drop below the high teens tonight, he said. Victims Identified</p>
        <p>The three men found dead during the weekend have been tentatively identified but their names will not be released until relatives are notified.</p>
        <p>A man described as being in his late 50's was found outside the CBS studios at 524 West 57th Street at 6:50 P.M. Saturday, according to the police. He was taken to Roosevelt Hospital and pronounced dead. The temperature was 19 degrees when his body was found, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
        <p>The second man, 42 years old, was discovered by a passer-by in a lot at 57 Pitt Street, on the Lower East Side, at 9:05 P.M. Saturday, when the temperature was 18 degrees.</p>
        <p>The third man, believed to be in his 60's, was found in a field on Wards Island at about 8:45 A.M. Sunday, when the temperature was 11 degrees. The man, who periodically stayed at a shelter on the island, had blood on his face. The cause was of the blood was not immediately determined but investigators did not consider the case a homicide, Sergeant Venetucci said.</p>
