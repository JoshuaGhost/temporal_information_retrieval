        <p>Mike Webster, the center who surprised the Pittsburgh Steelers on Friday by announcing his retirement, surprised them again today by saying he would return next season.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't really planned to retire in the first place,'' he said. ''If I was really going to retire I would have done it after the season and gotten on with my life's work.'' Webster, a 14-year veteran, is the last active Steeler with four Super Bowl rings.</p>
        <p>Webster said he came to an ''understanding'' with Dan Rooney, the Steelers president, over the weekend.</p>
        <p>''We might not be able to agree on it, but friends can disagree I think and still be friends,'' said Webster, who has a contract for 1988 worth an estimated $330,000, and an option for 1989.</p>
