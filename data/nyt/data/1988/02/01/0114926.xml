        <p>LEAD: A photographer for a national magazine recently approached Kathleen Wood with a request: find a Presidential nominating caucus that will take place in a one-room schoolhouse.</p>
        <p>A photographer for a national magazine recently approached Kathleen Wood with a request: find a Presidential nominating caucus that will take place in a one-room schoolhouse.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wood, coordinator of the Iowa Caucus Project, could not help. ''We don't have any one-room schoolhouses operating anymore,'' said Ms. Wood, whose organization provides information about the Feb. 8 caucuses.</p>
        <p>To many Iowans, that request typifies how many Eastern-based journalists misunderstand the modern-day character of their state. Only 10 percent of the population lives on a farm these days, the locals complain, but many reporters see the state as nothing but cornfields and cow barns.</p>
        <p>One joke going around here is that the state should simply build a pig farm next to the runway at the Des Moines airport so television crews can fly in, get their shots, and fly right out again.</p>
        <p>Katie Boyle, a spokesman for Senator Bob Dole, who is a native of Des Moines, said one photographer asked her to help set up a shot ''that says Iowa.'' His idea was to put a Dole bumper sticker on a tractor.</p>
        <p>''I was sort of torn, because I wanted our bumper sticker to get into the magazine,'' said Ms. Boyle, whose father is an executive with a large publishing company. ''On the other hand, I was really offended. That picture might have said Iowa to him, but that's not what says Iowa to me.'' Thriving State Capital</p>
        <p>Particularly to residents of Des Moines, the state capital and business center, Iowa means a sophisticated urban setting with a thriving insurance industry, a highly rated opera company, 34 colleges and universities, and the highest literacy rate in the nation.</p>
        <p>''I think we have people here who are smarter than they're given credit for,'' said Betty J. South, who runs a wall covering business.</p>
        <p>The candidates, too, are blamed for playing up the rural image of the state. ''Every time they photograph a candidate, they have him out in somebody's barn, milking a cow,'' complained Jim Youngblut, a building contractor in Waterloo who was attending a convention at a Des Moines hotel.</p>
        <p>''Look at this group here - none of us have been in a barn for years,'' Mr. Youngblut, who grew up on a farm in Gilbertvill, continued. ''I have a daughter in New York who's an actress, and the only barn she's ever been in was a riding stable, where she kept her horse.''</p>
        <p>Many Iowans like Mr. Youngblut, are only one or two generations removed from farm life. And like foreign immigrants who strive desperately to be accepted as Americans, these new urban dwellers sometimes seem defensive about their origins, and want very much to be accepted as city folks.</p>
        <p>But others seem pleased with the news coverage that has focused on Iowa. ''We are what we are, and I'm not ashamed of it,'' said Jim Ryan, executive vice president of the Master Builders of Iowa, a construction industry group.</p>
        <p>Gene Joerger, who heads the branch office of a large accounting firm here, says he likes all the recognition his state is getting: ''You talk on the telephone to your relatives in California, and they say, 'Hey, we saw Des Moines on TV.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Joerger admits that his partners in New York still do not understand what he does here. They think he audits farms, he says, not the large feed, fertilizer and implement distributors that make up most of his clientele. But he thinks the publicity generated by the caucuses has helped recruit businesses to the state.</p>
        <p>''The more they hear about us, they more they listen to us about expanding their business to Iowa someday,'' said the accountant.</p>
        <p>That is just what worries one young woman, who works for a company the processes magazine subscriptions. ''Don't clue them in about the way Iowa really is,'' she said. ''Or everybody will want to move here.''</p>
