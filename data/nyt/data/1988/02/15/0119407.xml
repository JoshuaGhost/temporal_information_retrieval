        <p>THE ICE is smooth now, glazed by a Zamboni machine. But for more than an hour during the Olympic 500-meter sprint last night, the white smear leading to the red base of the padded gray wall resembled the skid marks of an automobile accident. And in the years to come, spectators at the indoor Speed-Skating Oval will point to the ice on that first turn.</p>
        <p>''Over there,'' they will say. ''That's where Dan Jansen fell.''</p>
        <p>That's where Dan Jansen lost his balance. And that's where he lost his chance for the gold medal he had dedicated to his 27-year-old sister, Jane Beres, the mother of three young daughters, whom he had lost to leukemia in the morning, only five hours after their last telephone conversation.</p>
        <p>''She was still alive, she could understand me but she couldn't talk back to me,'' he recalled last night. ''She did understand what I said and I'm very happy about that, but I would like to keep the rest private.''</p>
        <p>His sister had been ill for about 13 months. When the square-jawed 22-year-old Olympian was asked last Friday about her condition, he said: ''She's not real good, they can't seem to get her into remission. She's having another round of chemotherapy. She'll watch my race in the hospital.'' But hours before the race, she died.</p>
        <p>''I had always planned on staying,'' he said last night, hinting that he knew her condition was more critical than he had acknowledged. ''That's what Jane would've wanted.''</p>
        <p>And about 8 seconds after his race started, for Dan Jansen, it was over. Sprawling across the ice in his skin-tight red-and-turquoise USA racing suit, he crashed into Yasushi Kuroiwa, a Japanese skater who had started in the outside line.</p>
        <p>''It felt like it slipped out from under me,'' he would say. ''The next thing I knew, I was in the pads.''</p>
        <p>Dan is the youngest of the nine Jansen children, many of whom had traveled to Calgary in two vans from their West Allis, Wis., home. But the mother had remained with Jane, and the father, who is retired, had returned home Saturday when Jane's condition worsened. Her widower, Richard, is a West Allis fireman with daughters ages 4, 3 and 1.</p>
        <p>''I talked to my family before the race,'' Dan said later, ''and they said to just go out there and do the best I could. Try to put as much out of my mind as I could. I tried to do that and I did it pretty well.''</p>
        <p>In the World Sprint Championships in Wisconsin a week ago, Jansen won both 500-meter races, thereby establishing himself as the Olympic gold-medal favorite. But in his grief, perhaps he simply tried too hard to win the gold medal.</p>
        <p>In the second of the two-man pairings, Jansen drewthe inside lane he had hoped for.</p>
        <p>''If you're the outside lane,'' he said Friday, ''you've got to chase the other guy down the backstretch. But if you start in the inside lane, you don't have to worry about him. Hopefully, you'll never see him.''</p>
        <p>At the starting line, Jansen was recalled for a false start. Another false start and he would have been disqualified.</p>
        <p>''Not only do I never fall, but I rarely jump either,'' he said of the false start. ''I was sort of confused after I did that. It was a strange thing. I don't do it very often. Why today, I don't know. I felt the best I've ever felt coming into this race. The last two weeks obviously were great. I don't know, maybe it just wasn't meant to be.''</p>
        <p>At the gun, Jansen was off slower than usual. ''I wasn't gripping the ice real well. I had that problem in the warmups. I felt I could not push as hard as I wanted.'' And when the ice is hard, when the long speed-skater's blades can't grip it, the possibility of a fall is always there. Especially when a skater hoping for a gold medal knows he's off to a slow start.</p>
        <p>''My first 100 meters,'' he said later, ''weren't normal.''</p>
        <p>After the fall, Jansen got up quickly. In his frustration and dismay, he raised his arms and then leaned over. Slowly, he glided along the ice, not even glancing at the fallen Kuroiwa, who was being attended by officials. Several minutes later, Jansen put his arm around Kuroiwa, apparently apologizing to him. Granted another start later, Kuroiwa finished 11th in the race won by Uwe-Jens Mey of East Germany in world record time of 36.45 seconds. But now Jansen, raising his arms to his head, kept gliding along the ice.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get to see Dan right away because I had torace next,'' Nick Thometz, another United States skater, said later. ''But all day, D. J. had seemed a little bit different. I think he did his best, but sometimes you can't think 100 percent when you have something like that happen.''</p>
        <p>While the other skaters raced, Jansen's fiancee, Natalie Greiner, a Canadian speed-skater, consoled him. But now he must try to prepare for Thursday night's 1,000-meter sprint. His sister's funeral has been delayed until after that race.</p>
        <p>''It's very important,'' he said. ''Once again, my family wants me to just go on, and I know Jane would've wanted that. I'm just going to go out there and try to put this behind me. There's nothing I can do about today. And we'll see what happens on Thursday.''  '88 WINTER OLYMPICS: SPORTS OF THE TIMES</p>
