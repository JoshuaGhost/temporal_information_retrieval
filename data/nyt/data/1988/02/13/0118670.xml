        <p>LEAD: The talk these days in Presidential campaigns is of a New Hampshire that is really an extension of the Massachusetts economy and the Boston media market.</p>
        <p>The talk these days in Presidential campaigns is of a New Hampshire that is really an extension of the Massachusetts economy and the Boston media market.</p>
        <p>That's true in many ways that matter to the campaigns, but it overlooks something important. It overlooks places like Goffstown.  True, this gentle old factory town along the Piscataquog River is within that Boston media market. It has its share of prosperous newcomers and also its old Yankees: the two groups that tend to dominate all discusions of today's New Hampshire politics.</p>
        <p>But in Goffstown's old working-class neighborhood of Pinardville, as in the blue-collar wards of cities like Manchester, Berlin and Groveton, there is another New Hampshire that is much overlooked.</p>
        <p>Jeanne Shaheen, a top Democratic organizer who has spent the last 12 years learning the byways of New Hampshire politics, said that history teaches candidates that ignoring this constituency is a grave error.</p>
        <p>In 1976, conservative blue-collar Democrats helped Jimmy Carter edge a field full of liberals.</p>
        <p>In 1980, conservative blue-collar Republicans helped Ronald Reagan win a big victory over George Bush.</p>
        <p>''You've got a lot of the George Wallace sort of vote,'' said Marshall Cobleigh, a former Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives. ''Blue-collar conservatives are a real phenomenon here.''</p>
        <p>They are all the more important because their conservative inclinations are strengthened daily by The Manchester Union Leader, the state's largest paper and a stout voice for the conservative cause. While the paper's influence is limited among newcomers to New Hampshire, it is still strong in the blue-collar bastions.</p>
        <p>Defining this segment of the New Hampshire electorate is difficult, but New York Times/CBS News polls of New Hampshire Democratic primary voters suggest its outlines.</p>
        <p>Among the Democrats in 1984, 49 percent of the voters earned less than $25,000 a year, fewer than half were college graduates and 51 percent were Catholics.</p>
        <p>Ms. Shaheen said that the influence of The Union Leader on blue-collar voters might normally spell trouble for the Presidential candidacy of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts. The Union Leader has run a steady series of articles criticizing him.</p>
        <p>That may be holding Mr. Dukakis's vote down some, but the polls show he is still doing quite well with blue-collar voters. Moreover, the candidate best positioned to challenge Mr. Dukakis for this vote, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, is himself coming under sharp attack from The Union Leader as well. In an editorial today, the paper said Mr. Gephardt had ''demonstrated the adaptability of a chameleon'' who had been on both sides of most issues.</p>
        <p>At a Democratic dinner in Concord tonight, Mr. Gephardt pursued the votes of Democrats who read The Union Leader. He said he was glad to be criticized by Mr. Dukakis and Senator Paul Simon of Illinois for supporting President Reagan's 1981 tax cut, and happy to be accused of being a ''tax cutter.''</p>
        <p>On the Republican side, blue-collar voters could be critical to the battle for conservative supremacy among Representative Jack F. Kemp of upstate New York, Pat Robertson and former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp was here on Thursday, campaigning at Linda's Family Restaurant and Bakery. Linda Waring, who owns the restaurant with her husband, George, said Mr. Kemp made some progress by promising waitresses not to tax their tips.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Waring said he had been amazed at the sudden activity on behalf of Mr. Robertson. ''Since Iowa -bam! - all of a sudden, he's all over town,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, along Route 114, which winds through the woods into town from Manchester, Robertson for President posters were everywhere; nailed to barns, tacked onto trees, attached to utility poles. Only one brave homeowner, at the edge of the town, displayed a George Bush sign. It was sagging today in the heavy, wind-blown snow.</p>
