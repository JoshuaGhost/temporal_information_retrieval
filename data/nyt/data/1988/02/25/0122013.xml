        <p>About 100 students of Hampshire College who took over a dormitory office to protest racism, marched across campus today to present a list of 12 demands to the college president.</p>
        <p>The group then returned to the dormitory, Dakin House, which they seized Tuesday morning, and said they did not plan to meet again with the college president, Adele Simmons, until Thursday morning.</p>
        <p>The protesters were escorted across campus by about 100 students.</p>
        <p>Among the protesters' demands were additional library materials dealing with Third World nations, establishment of a college policy on racial harassment, a full-time adviser for minority students, a permanent meeting place for minority students, a minority recruitment week each semester and no retaliatory actions against the protesters.</p>
