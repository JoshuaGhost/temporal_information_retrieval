        <p>LEAD: The touching story of a veteran who saw the photograph of a young Vietnamese girl in a magazine and thereby found the long-lost daughter he fathered in the war has taken an unexpected turn: The girl he brought back to California may not be his child.</p>
        <p>The touching story of a veteran who saw the photograph of a young Vietnamese girl in a magazine and thereby found the long-lost daughter he fathered in the war has taken an unexpected turn: The girl he brought back to California may not be his child.</p>
        <p>Barry Huntoon, 36 years old, of Paradise, Calif., about 185 miles northeast of here, acknowledged on Tuesday that the 16-year-old girl, Tuyet Mai, who has been living with his family since last year, may not be the child he thinks he fathered with a Vietnamese woman in 1972. Mr. Huntoon hopes, and the child's mother apparently agrees, that the girl will continue living with Mr. Huntoon, his wife and three children while the mother and her younger child live with a Vietnamese family in nearby Chico.</p>
        <p>The San Francisco Chronicle reported today that Mr. Huntoon said he would never know for sure whether Tuyet Mai was his daughter but that it did not matter. ''The fact is, she still needed a decent life and I'm glad I did everything I did,'' the newspaper quoted Mr. Huntoon as saying. Conflicting Accounts</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Huntoon nor his lawyer, Bruce Burns of San Jose, returned calls today seeking comment about the article. They are scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday in Chico to answer questions regarding conflicting press accounts as to whether Mr. Huntoon knew there was a question about his relationship to the girl but remained silent about it in order to sponsor her and her family for immigration.</p>
        <p>Press reports today quoted Mr. Huntoon and his wife, Laura, as saying that they learned in a telephone call from the State Department about two weeks ago that the girl's mother, Tranh Thi Ba, had told the authorities in Thailand shortly before her recent departure for the United States that Mr. Huntoon was not the father.</p>
        <p>In an article on Tuesday in The San Francisco Examiner, Mr. Huntoon was quoted as saying that he suspected early in his attempts to bring the girl to the United States that she was not his daughter, but that he persisted for humanitarian reasons.</p>
        <p>The girl's mother was reported to have realized that Mr. Huntoon was not Tuyet Mai's father when he sent a photograph of himself. She was quoted in an interview in The Examiner as saying that she told Mr. Huntoon when he came to Vietnam last year to take Tuyet Mai to the United States.</p>
        <p>She and her other child later made their way to a refugee camp in Thailand, where she said she told her story to officials. The mother and child remained in the camp while recovering from tuberculosis. They arrived in the United States on Monday. State Department Satisfied</p>
        <p>Sheppie Abramowitz, a spokeswoman for the State Department's Bureau of Refugee Programs, declined to comment on the details of the case. ''We are mostly interested in having the young woman and her mother have a successful and appropriate resettlement in this country,'' Ms. Adramowitz said. ''We are confident it can be worked out in an appropriate way.''</p>
        <p>The story of Mr. Huntoon and Tuyet Mai received national attention last November when it was featured on ABC's ''20/20'' and on numerous other televison shows and in newspaper articles. Mr. Huntoon, who had served as a medic in Vietnam in the early 1970's, had seen a 1985 article in Life magazine about the plight of children fathered by American servicemen in Vietnam and saw the picture of a young girl who bore a remarkable resemblance to him.</p>
        <p>The Vietnamese woman with whom he had lived had been nine months pregnant when he was shipped back home, and he had been told that she had died. There were no records of the birth of a child.</p>
        <p>He became convinced that the hazel-eyed girl pictured selling peanuts in Vung Tau was his daughter. He hired a lawyer to assist him and lobbied legislators to be allowed to bring the girl to the United States. He was able to send her a letter and although she was illiterate, with the help of neighbors she wrote back saying, ''Dear Father, when I received the news that you were looking for me, I was very happy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Abramowitz said that neither the Bureau of Refugee Programs nor its agency for organizing resettlement of Southeast Asian refugees, the Orderly Departure Program, is considering any charges against Mr. Huntoon should it be shown that he knowingly assisted in a fraudulant entry into this country. The family has a legal right to be here under established refugee programs and if Tuyet Mai had an American father, she is an American citizen, she said.</p>
