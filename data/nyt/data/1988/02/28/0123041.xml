        <p>LEAD: THAT ARTISTS WHO ARE KNOWN primarily as painters also take photographs is not news. Photography, after all, is no longer considered a natural enemy of the brush, as it was in the dark ages 100 years ago.

        <p>THAT ARTISTS WHO ARE KNOWN primarily as painters also take photographs is not news. Photography, after all, is no longer considered a natural enemy of the brush, as it was in the dark ages 100 years ago. As a result, what matters today is not whether an artist uses photographs, but the part that camera images play in his or her work.</p>
        <p>For some, such as Josef Albers, whose photographs from the Bauhaus years are now on view at the Museum of Modern Art, photography was a momentary, if fascinating, diversion. For others, such as Charles Sheeler, whose retrospective exhibition is now at the Whitney Museum of American Art, it played a more central role.</p>
        <p>Albers (1888-1976), an early student at the avant-garde Weimar design school, and a member of its faculty from 1923 to 1933, shared in the experimental spirit of its time. He eagerly explored areas not traditionally associated with high culture, including stained-glass windows and furniture, trying to bring art closer to life. Not surprisingly, he also became interested in photography, which he pursued in earnest from 1928 to 1932.</p>
        <p>Today, of course, Albers is best known for his series of postwar paintings titled ''Homage to the Square.'' These abstract, refined, proto-Minimalist color studies seem far removed from the ebullient, sometimes giddy quality of his photographs, 38 of which are on display. The photographs range from portraits of Bauhaus colleagues and images of laundry drying on a line to collages consisting of up to a dozen individual images arranged and mounted on board. Although a few provide evidence of Albers's interest in geometric form, most seem more intent on describing a world of animation and unexpected coincidences.</p>
        <p>One could make the case that Albers was interested in finding new ways of using the camera to make art, investigating its unique qualities, just as later he assayed the qualities of color and tonality in the ''Square'' paintings. Certainly, the variety of approaches evident even in this small selection of images lends credence to this assumption. But it would be a mistake to think that his methods were entirely original. As John Szarkowski, the show's curator and director of the museum's photography department, points out in his catalogue essay, Albers took up photography just after Laszlo Moholy-Nagy left the Bauhaus. Moholy-Nagy had introduced many avant-garde approaches to photography into Bauhaus circles, including photo-collage, bird's-eye views, negative prints and light-and-shadow studies - approaches Albers was not shy about using.</p>
        <p>In addition, one can feel in Albers's images influences as diverse as Parisian Surrealism and Russian Constructivism. Only the multiple-print collages seem the artist's own. In the best of these - ''Bullfight,'' circa 1930, for example - a geometric structure abets the camera's penchant for building narrative drama from a myriad of details. The often tattered and stained collages are unprepossessing as visual objects, but they can be admired for their playful, inquisitive spirit.</p>
        <p>''The Photographs of Josef Albers,'' selected from the archive of the Albers Foundation and organized by the American Federation of the Arts, continues at the Museum of Modern Art through April 19, after which it will travel to Denver and Montreal.</p>
        <p>Photography was but a brief episode in Albers's career, and from the evidence of his later work (none of it to be found in the show) it was not a pivotal one. For Charles Sheeler, on the other hand, photography was essential in terms of both his technique and his esthetic. In the retrospective exhibition of Sheeler's paintings, drawings and photographs, organized by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and now at the Whitney through April 17, the influence of photography is unmistakable and crucial. Many of the works in oil or conte crayon are virtually exact duplicates of photographs Sheeler had taken earlier. With other paintings and drawings in the show, there is no corresponding photographic image in existence, but the perspective, tonality and attention to detail all speak of photographic precedent.</p>
        <p>At the start of his career in the early 1900's Sheeler painted in a manner loosely derived from Cezanne. But a few years after 1912, when he took up photography as a way to earn his keep, his style became more representational and photographic. The 1913 Armory Show may also have influenced his move toward structural form, but it was his photography that supplied the means for translating the physical world into its simplified equivalent - the part-Realist, Cubist-indebted style that we know as Precisionism.</p>
        <p>With its 90-odd photographs and a nearly equal number of paintings and drawings, the exhibition supplies abundant evidence of Sheeler's reliance on the camera. It includes, for example, both his well-known painting of a locomotive's drive wheels, ''Rolling Power'' of 1939, and the photograph, ''Wheels,'' on which it is based. Unfortunately, however, the show is organized by medium rather than date, so comparing the photographs to their corresponding drawings and paintings is a task that involves shuttling from gallery to gallery.</p>
        <p>What is worse, however, is that the show is hung backwards. Instead of seeing the photographs, then the drawings and finally the paintings, which is the order in which Sheeler generally worked, we are first confronted by the paintings. The photographs are confined to the galleries farthest from the entrance. While this arrangement serves to validate the art marketplace's established pecking order, it does violence to any understanding of Sheeler's methods. More than that, it makes him look like a mediocre artist.</p>
        <p>In fact, some of Sheeler's greatest pictures are photographs, and for a time his renown as a photographer exceeded his reputation as a painter. Only the art world's inability to accept the notion that photographs could be as important as paintings led him to de-emphasize his independent work with the camera. But even after his dealer advised him, in 1931, to quit photography for painting, Sheeler continued to take photographs as source material for his works on canvas. Indeed, the show's most intriguing paintings are from the late 40's and early 50's, when the artist began to paint from photographs printed from two or more negatives. One lesson of the show is that our tendency to consider artists' photographs as subordinate to their paintings sometimes fails to do justice to their careers. Canvas is not always the ultimate repository of whatever lessons artists learn in their encounters with the lens.</p>
        <p>In our own time, the artist most like Sheeler in terms of making photography an essential part of his art may well be Lucas Samaras. Since taking his first Polaroids in the 1960's, he has continued to find ways to use photographic images to fuel his concerns with identity, ego, family history and artistic performance. All this is writ large in an excellent new book, ''Samaras: The Photographs of Lucas Samaras,'' by Ben Lifson (Aperture, $50). Mr. Lifson, a photography critic, argues persuasively that in the last 15 years photography has shifted from being ''a subsidiary element'' in Samaras's oeuvre to assume a position at its core.</p>
