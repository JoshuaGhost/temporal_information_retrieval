        <p>LEAD: In a case that is certain to stir emotions in the Arab world, Egypt today charged the eldest son of President Gamal Abdel Nasser with involvement in the murder and attempted murder of several Israeli and American diplomats.</p>
        <p>In a case that is certain to stir emotions in the Arab world, Egypt today charged the eldest son of President Gamal Abdel Nasser with involvement in the murder and attempted murder of several Israeli and American diplomats.</p>
        <p>The indictment, according to news reports received here, asks for the death sentence for Nasser's son, Khalid Abdel Nasser, and 10 of the 19 other defendants. It accuses them of belonging to a secret leftist organization, Egypt Revolution, a Nasserite group that opposes the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.</p>
        <p>In announcing the indictment in Cairo, the chief public prosecutor, Mohammed el-Guindi, said Khalid Nasser, 30 years old, was charged with complicity in organizing and financing the attacks on the Israelis and the Americans. Nasser Name 'Carries Magic'</p>
        <p>The indictment comes at a sensitive time; sentiment about the Israeli crackdown of Palestinian protests in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip is running high.</p>
        <p>In addition, a senior Arab official here said tonight, ''Gamal Abdel Nasser's name still carries magic around here and among all Arabs.''</p>
        <p>Nasser, who led Egypt from 1952 until he died of a heart attack in 1970, is revered by many Arabs even though he helped bring the Arab countries to their greatest defeat, against Israel in the 1967 war. The defeat resulted in the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as well as the Golan Heights of Syria and the Sinai Desert. Israel returned Sinai to Egypt under the 1978 Camp David accords.</p>
        <p>Charged with Khalid Nasser is Gamal Shawki Abdel Nasser, a nephew of the late President, and two army officers.</p>
        <p>Several Egyptians said the two Nassers were believed to have taken refuge in Yugoslavia after fleeing Egypt a few months ago as security officials developed the case. Other reports said the nephew was in Britain. Group Acknowledged Killings</p>
        <p>The prosecutor accused the Egypt Revolution group of responsibility for the assassination of an Israeli commercial attache in August 1985, the killing of an Israeli Embassy employee, the wounding of several Israelis in 1986 at Cairo's international book exhibit and the attempted murder of three American security and intelligence officers in their car last May in Cairo.</p>
        <p>Egypt Revolution, whose members were said to include doctors, businessmen and civil servants, took responsibility for all those actions.</p>
        <p>Mr. el-Guindi said the defendants intended to ''assassinate foreign diplomats to show that Egypt was insecure and to undermine relations between Egypt and these foreign states,'' meaning Israel and the United States.</p>
        <p>Unlike Islamic fundamentalists who have carried out several killings of Egyptian officials, Egypt Revolution enjoys a significant amount of sympathy in Egypt and throughout much of the Arab world.</p>
        <p>The group's attacks were seen as legitimate actions against Israel and the United States, which supports Israel, and they were hailed in the Arab press as nationalistic acts against the ''illegitimate'' Israeli presence in Egypt.</p>
        <p>A senior Egyptian Government official said the indictment shows that ''no one here is above the law, despite the highly controversial nature of the case.'' Investigators Were Stymied</p>
        <p>The killings disturbed Egyptian security officials because the attacks had been carried out smoothly and baffled investigators. The investigation made progress last August when one of the defendants told security officers about the group.</p>
        <p>Mr. el-Guindi said no foreign governments were involved in the attacks, although there had been suggestions in the Egyptian press that Libya was financing the Egypt Revolution group.</p>
        <p>Ten members of the group are in custody. Nine defendants, including Khalid Nasser's cousin Gamal, face jail terms if convicted of lesser charges. The Supreme State Security Court is to conduct the trial.</p>
        <p>The group's leader, according to the indictment, is Mahmoud Noureedin el-Sayed Sulaiman, who worked in the Egyptian Embassy in London in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>News reports said the prosecutor released a transcript of videotaped testimony that indicated that Mr. Sulaiman's brother, who is among the defendants, told security officers last August about the group.</p>
