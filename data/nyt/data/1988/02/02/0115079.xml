        <p>LEAD: The Senate overwhelmingly approved two International Labor Organization conventions today, marking the first time in nearly 35 years that the United States has formally approved treaties with the United Nations agency.</p>
        <p>The Senate overwhelmingly approved two International Labor Organization conventions today, marking the first time in nearly 35 years that the United States has formally approved treaties with the United Nations agency.</p>
        <p>One convention obliges the nations that adhere to it to maintain minimum working and living conditions for seafarers; the other is essentially procedural, requiring consultations between workers, employers and the Government on issues involving the International Labor Organization, particularly in setting labor standards. The conventions were approved by votes of 84 to 0, and 81 to 2, respectively.</p>
        <p>Forty-four nations have joined the seafarers convention since it was adopted by the I.L.O. in 1976, but it has languished in the Senate since 1986 when President Reagan first submitted it to the Congress. Similarly, about 20 nations have approved the convention on labor standards.</p>
        <p>The conventions were supported by labor groups, and they hailed its approval today.</p>
        <p>With today's action, the United States has ratified 9 of the 162 conventions adopted by the I.L.O. since its founding in 1919 as an affiliate of the United Nations' predecessor, the League of Nations. The I.L.O., with more than 150 members, is one of the largest of the United Nations' specialized agencies, which include the World Health Organization and Unesco.</p>
