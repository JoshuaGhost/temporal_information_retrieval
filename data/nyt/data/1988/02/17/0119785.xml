        <p>LEAD: Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been moved out of intensive care, and his condition continues to improve after surgery to correct an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood to his brain, a spokesman for Walter Reed Army Medical Center said today.</p>
        <p>Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been moved out of intensive care, and his condition continues to improve after surgery to correct an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood to his brain, a spokesman for Walter Reed Army Medical Center said today.</p>
        <p>''Physicians are pleased with his continued progress and his condition is listed as satisfactory,'' said the spokesman, Pete Esker. He said Mr. Biden, 45 years old, was talking with his family and could move all of his limbs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Biden, a Delaware Democrat, was admitted to the hospital early Friday after being transferred from St. Francis Hospital in Wilmington, Del., where he lives. He underwent eight hours of surgery, which did not involve removal of any brain tissue. Earlier reports that the aneurysm had burst were incorrect, Mr. Esker said.</p>
        <p>The three-term Senator, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, withdrew from the Democratic Presidential race last September.</p>
