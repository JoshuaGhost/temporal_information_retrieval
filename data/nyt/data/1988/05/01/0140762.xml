        <p>LEAD: The Reagan Administration's new approach to Panama's leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, is perceived in Panama as a risky move that may not resolve the country's political crisis.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration's new approach to Panama's leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, is perceived in Panama as a risky move that may not resolve the country's political crisis.</p>
        <p>Panamanian Government officials and opposition politicians are untypically in accord in describing American policy as contradictory and as offering new maneuvering room to General Noriega, which could prolong negotiations for his departure.</p>
        <p>General Noriega's supporters suggest that if he does not give in, American officials will feel forced to make further concessions.</p>
        <p>''They are negotiating with a guy who has been making deals all his life, a guy experienced in intelligence work,'' said a Panamanian businessman who supports the ruling, pro-military party. ''Noriega is a master of negotiations. He'll sign anything and then do what he wants. I think the Americans don't know what to do about him.'' Backing Down From Threat</p>
        <p>In Central American politics, an adversary who openly threatens another, but then is forced to back down and negotiate, is seen as having lost half the political battle. From this weakened position, subsequent negotiations are extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>That process now appears to be under way in the confrontation between General Noriega and the Administration.</p>
        <p>After the general's indictment in the United States in February on drug-trafficking and racketeering charges, the Administration mounted a campaign for his ouster and exile from Panama. But as it became clear that diplomatic and economic pressures were not working, the Administration shifted its emphasis, sending an envoy, Michael G. Kozak, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, to negotiate with the general on relinquishing power. Mr. Kozak, who returned to Washington on Thursday after more than a week of talks, reportedly discussed the possibility of the general's staying in Panama after stepping down, although Administration officials say many issues remain to be resolved before any agreement is reached. Sanctions Last Strong Card</p>
        <p>The Administration's last strong card, opposition politicians and American officials here say, is to maintain economic sanctions against Panama to force General Noriega out.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the General has made the lifting of sanctions his first condition for agreeing to leave power later this year. Panamanian political analysts say, however, that such a move will allow General Noriega to prolong negotiations further in hopes that the Administration's position will weaken under the pressure of the presidential campaign in the United States.</p>
        <p>General Noriega, speaking at a trade union congress here tonight, denounced United States pressure on Panama and said, ''This is the hour of taking not one step backward - those who thought this was only rhetoric are making a mistake here.''</p>
        <p>Earlier, an adviser to General Noriega spoke of a new ''realism'' in the Administration's dealings with the general.</p>
        <p>''They began very arrogantly, very foolishly, trying to order us what to do,'' the adviser said. ''Now there is more flexibility. Maybe in time we can work something out. But there is no hurry.''</p>
        <p>The adviser said that the Reagan Administration had softened the terms under which General Noriega should relinquish control of the military and that Mr. Kozak's mission has effectively cut the American Embassy in Panama out of negotiations with the general. He said that this is to General Noriega's advantage because in the general's view the embassy takes a harder line against him. U.S. Electoral Campaign a Factor</p>
        <p>In addition, the general's supporters say, the new American willingness to negotiate shows that the Administration itself is now under political pressure to find a solution in Panama. The adviser said he doubted the Administration would now intervene militarily in Panama and that it cannot tolerate a long standoff in the midst of the criticisms generated by a presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>He added that the regime is well aware that there are bitter disagreements among the Pentagon, the State Department and the American Embassy here on policy toward the general and that such divisions are in General Noriega's favor.</p>
        <p>Finally, the general's supporter noted that a Federal judge in Miami has agreed to allow General Noriega's lawyer to contest an indictment against him for drug dealing, without the general himself being required to appear in the court in person. 'Noriega-ism Without Noriega'</p>
        <p>When told that the Reagan Administration had no influence over the Federal judge's decision, the adviser expressed disbelief. He was sure, he said, that it was all part of an overall deal being coordinated by the White House.</p>
        <p>In Panama, judges are politically dominated by the regime and do what they are told in sensitive cases. Given the talks under way between the Administration and General Noriega, it is inconceivable to the general's supporters that the White House cannot manipulate the indictments against him in Miami.</p>
        <p>The Panamanian political opposition now fears that General Noriega is going to negotiate a deal with Washington that leaves Panama with what one opposition leader called ''Noriega-ism without Noriega.''</p>
        <p>The leader of the opposition Christian Democratic Party, Ricardo Arias Calderon, today issued a statement warning American officials that his party would oppose any deal that gives too much power to General Noriega and his pro-military party machine. Demands General Leave Country</p>
        <p>Mr. Arias Calderon said his party would now demand that any deal should require General Noriega to leave Panama for a ''significant period of time'' during which an independent commission will be formed to investigate charges of wrongdoing by the general.</p>
