        <p>Before getting down to business in the Kremlin yesterday, President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev added to their summit anthology of Russian folk wisdom. Mr. Gorbachev seemed to have some trouble with Mr. Reagan's contribution, rendered in fractured Russian.</p>
        <p>''Aware of your interest in Russian proverbs,'' Mr. Gorbachev began the exchange, ''let me add another to your collection: 'It is better to see once than to hear a hundred times.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan, who not so many years ago pilloried the Communist superpower as an ''evil empire,'' rejoined, ''In order not to disappoint anyone on this visit, I thought I would mention a literary saying from your past, another example of your people's succinct wisdom.''</p>
        <p>Alluding to the benefits of an evolutionary improvement in superpower relations, the President then said in Russian, or meant to say, ''Rodilsya, ne toropilsya.''</p>
        <p>Some of his listeners were bemused by Mr. Reagan's mispronunciation. Neither Mr. Gorbachev nor his wife, Raisa, seemed to understand until a Russian interpreter unscrambled the adage for them:</p>
        <p>''It was born, it wasn't rushed.''</p>
        <p>Thus enlightened, Mr. Gorbachev responded that he was always for avoiding haste and for moving with consistency and confidence.</p>
