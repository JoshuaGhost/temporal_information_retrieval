        <p>LEAD: The pilot of a Continental Airlines DC-9 took evasive action yesterday to avoid hitting a light plane about five miles southeast of Cleveland's main airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.</p>
        <p>The pilot of a Continental Airlines DC-9 took evasive action yesterday to avoid hitting a light plane about five miles southeast of Cleveland's main airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.</p>
        <p>A flight attendant was thrown about as the plane made a sharp climbing turn to the left, an agency spokesman said. The attendant suffered minor injuries.</p>
        <p>The Continental pilot reported the incident to the F.A.A. as a near-collision, estimating the miss distance as 100 feet vertically and the span of the DC-9's wing horizontally.</p>
        <p>Controllers handling the twin-jet DC-9, on a flight from Boston to Cleveland with 79 passengers and a crew of 5, said the light twin-engine plane did not show up on the Cleveland air-traffic-control radar, the spokesman said. Apparently the plane was flying by ''visual flight rules'' usable in good weather, and was not under jurisdiction of the F.A.A. control system. The weather at the time of the incident, 2:06 P.M., was good, with a visibility of eight miles. Investigation Is Planned</p>
        <p>The National Transportation Safety Board said it would conduct a formal investigation.</p>
        <p>Last week, two airliners flying outside of radar coverage nearly collided at high altitude over the Atlantic Ocean several hundred miles east of Miami.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's incident occurred as the Continental plane was at 7,000 feet flying westbound, preparing for a landing at the Cleveland-Hopkins Airport, the F.A.A. said.</p>
        <p>The small plane, thought to be a Piper, was reported by the Continental crew to have been climbing toward the southeast.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate indication whether the private plane also took evasive action, or whether its pilot even saw the airliner. The Continental pilot told the F.A.A. that he had gained 800 feet of altitude in making his maneuver. The airliner then landed safely in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>One focus of the safety board inquiry was certain to be whether the private plane was following F.A.A. rules. At issue was whether the close call took place within the Cleveland ''terminal control area'' where planes may not legally fly unless they have transponders that will accentuate their image on radarscopes and unless the pilot has obtained permission of traffic controllers.</p>
        <p>The controlled area is shaped like an upside-down wedding cake and reaches to a top altitude of 7,000 feet. At that altitude, the area extends horizontally to about 25 miles from the airport.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. said that the small plane pilot had not sought permission to enter the T.C.A. and was ''not in radio contact with controllers.''</p>
