        <p>LEAD: Edgar Degas's ''Little Dancer at 14 Years of Age,'' a bronze of the artist's 1881 wax sculpture of a bold young dancer in a relaxed pose, was sold last night for $10.12 million, a record at auction for the artist and for any sculpture.

        <p>Edgar Degas's ''Little Dancer at 14 Years of Age,'' a bronze of the artist's 1881 wax sculpture of a bold young dancer in a relaxed pose, was sold last night for $10.12 million, a record at auction for the artist and for any sculpture. The buyer, was identified only as a Euorpean.</p>
        <p>Of the 54 artworks offered, 18 were sold for more than $1 million each; just three did not find buyers. The auction totaled $94.4 million, the second highest figure for a sale of art at auction, exceeded only by Sotheby's sale last November at which van Gogh's ''Irises,'' was sold for $53.9 million.</p>
        <p>The 37 1/2-inch-tall Degas sculpture's naturalness shocked the public of its day. The critic Paul Mantz wrote at the time that the work was ''nearly terrifying.'' He said that ''the unhappy child is standing wearing a cheap gauze dress,'' and he went on to add, ''She is thoughtless with bestial effrontery.'' The Price Astounds</p>
        <p>The standing-room audience last night was astounded - not by the bronze's stance, but by the price paid. The figure was more than double Sotheby's expectations. It was also the second time in its history that the Degas ballet dancer went for a record price for sculpture. Belle Linsky and her husband, Jack, makers of Swingline staplers, purchased it in 1971 at the Norton Simon sale at Sotheby's for $380,000, then a record. The sculpture was sold last night from the estate of Mrs. Linsky who died last year at the age of 83.</p>
        <p>Artist records were also rewritten for Cezanne, with the sale for $9.24 million of an oil-on-canvas landscape from 1867, depicting the woods and hills of Pontoise near Paris. The successful bidder was an agent from the Seibu department store in Tokyo; the actual buyer was not identified.</p>
        <p>Renoir's 1886 study of Aline Charigot, who married Renoir four years after he finished this painting and who is shown nursing their infant son Pierre, was sold for $8.8 million to a German collector whose name was not disclosed. The price was a record for the artist at auction. A Record for a Matisse</p>
        <p>Matisse's ''Lemons Against Fleur de Lis Background,'' was sold for $5.7 million to an American collector whose name was not disclosed, an auction record for the artist. Sisley's ''The Bridge of Moret in the Sun,'' from 1892, brought $1.37 million, an artist record at auction.</p>
        <p>John McEnroe looked uncharacteristically relaxed, sitting with his arm around his wife, Tatum O'Neal, throughout the sale. Toward the end, he purchased one of the least expensive paintings - Picasso's ''House at Joan Les Pins,'' from 1931, for $209,000. ''He bid with his strong left arm,'' said the evening's auctioneer, John L. Marion, the chairman of Sotheby's.</p>
        <p>The art dealer Richard L. Feigen said, ''These prices have nothing to do with quality or reality.''</p>
