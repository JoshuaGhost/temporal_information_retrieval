        <p>LEAD: Morton E. Handel, who has served under Arnold C. Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Coleco Industries, now finds himself in Mr. Greenberg's seat with a mission to salvage the company.</p>
        <p>Morton E. Handel, who has served under Arnold C. Greenberg, chairman and chief executive of Coleco Industries, now finds himself in Mr. Greenberg's seat with a mission to salvage the company.</p>
        <p>''My primary focus will be making every effort to save the company, to have it survive the current financial difficulties,'' Mr. Handel said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Handel, 53 years old, was named chairman and chief executive of the toy maker Wednesday after Mr. Greenberg, 55, resigned. Mr. Greenberg, who holds 16 percent of Coleco, will continue as a director and a consultant.</p>
        <p>Coleco, based in West Hartford, Conn., and known for its Cabbage Patch dolls, was founded as the Connecticut Leather Company in 1932 by Mr. Greenberg's father, Maurice. Mr. Greenberg's brother, Leonard E., a former chairman, is a director. J. Brian Clarke, 49, continues as president and chief operating officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Handel ''is the right man in the right place at the right time,'' said David S. Leibowitz, analyst at the American Securities Corporation. ''If anybody can succeed in getting this thing back on the right track, it's Mort Handel.''</p>
        <p>Coleco has said it might be forced to seek protection in bankruptcy court if debt holders cannot agree to a new financial plan. The company has also hired the Hallwood Group to help it restructure.</p>
        <p>Mr. Handel said his task would be to build an organization ''which in the future is measurably more risk-averse than it has been in the past.''</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged the problems he was facing. ''The difficulty in this industry is not merely managing growth,'' he said, ''but managing the sales reductions, the inventory issues. That's where most toy companies stumble and get hurt.''</p>
        <p>Coleco's latest troubles began after Cabbage Patch sales began to plummet. It suffered financial reverses earlier when its Adam home computer flopped.</p>
        <p>Mr. Handel is a veteran of these ups and downs at Coleco, having joined the company 14 years ago as chief financial officer. Since 1983, he has been executive vice president, with varying responsibilities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Handel, who grew up in the Forest Hills section of Queens, is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and did graduate work at New York University's business school.</p>
        <p>After working as an executive with several companies, including a marine hardware maker and construction equipment manufacturer, he joined the toy industry as senior vice president of Aurora Products, then a unit of RJR Nabisco. He moved to Coleco three years later.</p>
