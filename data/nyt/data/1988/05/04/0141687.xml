        <p>LEAD: The Reagan Administration expects U.S. arms sales to reach $15 billion this year. Not long ago, that news would have touched off earnest but misleading debate on the evils of all arms exports.</p>
        <p>The Reagan Administration expects U.S. arms sales to reach $15 billion this year. Not long ago, that news would have touched off earnest but misleading debate on the evils of all arms exports.</p>
        <p>Congress understands now that the problem is not the total volume of arms sales, but particular sales to particular countries. Generally, arms transfers to NATO nations, Israel and South Korea raise few issues. The sales buttress U.S. foreign policy and national security interests.</p>
        <p>But certain sales to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and sometimes Egypt pose problems. Like its recent predecessors, the Reagan Administration resents tough questioning from Congress, a process that often creates problems with friendly countries. Yet because there's been so much shoddy thinking about arms sales over the years, Congress is right to intervene.</p>
        <p>In general, both Congress and the executive branch have too often ignored diplomacy as a solution to the troublesome aspects of arms exports. For example, East and West share an interest in not exporting weapons that can readily be used by terrorists, such as shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles. And suppliers of medium-range missiles, such as those recently sold by China to Saudi Arabia, should also be talking with each other about common restraints. Last year, the U.S., Japan and five other Western countries agreed to control the sale of these missiles and related technology. But it makes little sense not to try to include China and the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>These and other issues arise now in the wake of the Administration's annual report to Congress on prospective sales. The report shows total sales of weapons and services rising to about $15 billion in 1988 from $11.7 billion last year.</p>
        <p>Israel is expected to buy $3.6 billion. Given Washington's renewed interest in promoting Middle East peace talks, it's more important than ever to reassure Israelis of their security. Sales to Egypt amounting to $2.7 billion are planned, mostly for the latest U.S. tank. It's not clear why Cairo requires such an expensive and capable machine; here again, however, the Administration will not encounter strong opposition.</p>
        <p>As for sales to other Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, the State Department will stress the need to shore up friendly countries in the Persian Gulf. But Congress would do well to ask how the Administration intends to link the sales with peace efforts, and what their impact will be on Israel's security. At the same time, it must also recognize that Riyadh and others can buy the weapons elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Japan wants to purchase a sophisticated system for defending its ships. In this case, the Administration will confront legitimate concerns that Japanese industry might be tempted to steal the technology.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the hardest cases involve poor nations like Pakistan. Islamabad hopes to buy almost $800 million in new sophisticated aircraft, though its economy is in desperate shape. To Pakistan's leaders, perceived threats from India and the Soviet Union override all else. Even if Washington urged restraint, it would fall on deaf ears and Pakistani leaders would find other sellers.</p>
        <p>Sellers and buyers alike are unhappy when Congress raises tough questions about sales. But the debate clarifies policy, and identifies risks.</p>
