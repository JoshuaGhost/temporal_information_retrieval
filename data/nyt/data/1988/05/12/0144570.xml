        <p>To The Home Section:</p>
        <p>Although my children are grown, I read the Parent &amp; Child column by Lawrence Kutner from time to time and was prompted to react to the one about the ''right'' number of children to have  [ April 14 ] . What struck me was that he talks as if the relationship between siblings, good or bad, ends with their youth. He does not mention at all the advantages or disadvantages in adult life of being an only child or one of several.</p>
        <p>I, now middle aged, am one of three children. I do not feel one way or another about whether I would have been happier, better adjusted or worse off if I had been an only child. But I would feel lonely as an only child now.</p>
        <p>I was never particularly close to my sister and brother when we grew up, and now they both live abroad. But I feel closer to them than any of my friends, purely based on our siblingness, and I value their support, and happily give mine to them.</p>
        <p>This is particularly important as parents get older. I am glad that my own children will have each other in my later years. And after my death and that of their father, they will have each other for a good period afterward. ALICE VICTOR  Greenwich, Conn.</p>
