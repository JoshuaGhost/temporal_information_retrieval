        <p>LEAD: Japan's trade surplus declined in March for the third consecutive month, the Government reported today, and Japanese investments in the United States have slowed.</p>
        <p>Japan's trade surplus declined in March for the third consecutive month, the Government reported today, and Japanese investments in the United States have slowed.</p>
        <p>Japan had a March surplus of $8.12 billion in its current-account balance of trade in merchandise and services, down from $8.49 billion in March 1987. Trade in goods eased to a $9.24 billion surplus from $9.39 billion. In February, with its fewer days, the current-account surplus was $6.85 billion, while trade in goods was $7.44 billion.</p>
        <p>Japanese money flowing into United States Treasury bonds and other long-term investments dropped to less than half the amount going abroad in February or March last year.</p>
        <p>''This trend will continue,'' said Soichiro Akahane, an economist at the Bank of Tokyo. ''The amount may recover in April or May, but the speed of long-term investment outflows will slow.''</p>
        <p>Outflows of long-term Japanese investments, minus the amount of similar investments coming into Japan from abroad, dropped to $3.25 billion in March, from the $8.31 billion of a year before.</p>
        <p>Japan's current account for the fiscal year ended March 31 showed a surplus of $84.54 billion, against $94.14 billion in the previous year. Its surplus for trade in goods dropped to $94.28 billion from $101.65 billion.</p>
        <p>Toshiaki Kakimoto, the Sumitomo Bank's chief economist, said both the monthly and annual trade surpluses should continue to shrink in the present fiscal year. He expects trade in goods and services to fall to $79 billion and trade in merchandise to fall to $91 billion.</p>
        <p>Japanese officials have been worried about fluctuations of the dollar in relation to the yen, which makes overseas investing risky from the Japanese viewpoint, economists said.</p>
        <p>''If the currency rates do not stabilize, Japanese investments abroad are likely to shrink,'' Mr. Kakimoto said. ''The trend for long-term investing overseas will depend on the dollar.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Akahane said Japanese investors were also hesitant to put a lot of money into United States bonds or securities, as they have in the past, because of fear that American interest rates may edge higher. Rising interest rates often depress bond and equity markets.</p>
