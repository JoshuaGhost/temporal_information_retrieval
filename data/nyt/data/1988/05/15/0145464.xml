        <p>LEAD: At the age of 33, Steve Largent of the Seattle Seahawks is getting a bit long in the tooth for a National Football League receiver.

        <p>At the age of 33, Steve Largent of the Seattle Seahawks is getting a bit long in the tooth for a National Football League receiver. Because he has already made his mark - he holds the league receiving record with 752 career catches - it would seem to be time for Largent to start thinking about retirement.</p>
        <p>Not so fast. Largent, who will be suiting up for his 13th season this fall, has his eyes fixed on the season ahead and says retirement isn't in sight. ''I'm not looking beyond this year,'' he said at the Seahawk's minicamp. ''I'm going to do every thing I can to do the best I can this year.''</p>
        <p>For that he has some special incentives. Largent, who caught 58 passes for 912 yards and 8 touchdowns in the strike-shortened 1987 season, needs just four touchdowns to pass Don Hutson's record of 99 touchdowns and 105 more yards to eclipse Charlie Joiner's record of 12,146 yards.(AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE</p>
