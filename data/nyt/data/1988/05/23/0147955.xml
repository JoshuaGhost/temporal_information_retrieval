        <p>LEAD: As a senior at an exclusive New England preparatory school, George Bush saved a younger classmate from being beaten by a bully. Forty-seven years later, the events that day at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., are bringing enormous financial rewards to Mr. Bush's Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>As a senior at an exclusive New England preparatory school, George Bush saved a younger classmate from being beaten by a bully. Forty-seven years later, the events that day at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., are bringing enormous financial rewards to Mr. Bush's Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>''I'm a political fund-raiser because of one man and that's George Bush,'' said Bruce S. Gelb, now vice chairman of Bristol-Myers in New York. ''At Andover, he was my hero. He was God.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gelb is one of a dozen businessmen, many of them multimillionaires, who each personally raised or coordinated efforts to raise as much as $1 million for Mr. Bush in the primary season. They are the standouts from the campaign's national finance board of 350 members, each of whom amassed an average of more than $20,000.</p>
        <p>The commitment of these men enabled the campaign to surpass even the financial records set by President Reagan, an achievement that helped Mr. Bush stave off less flush Republican rivals in the battle for the party's Presidential nomination.</p>
        <p>Telling why they devoted countless months from their jobs and families to raise $23 million, not including $8 million in Federal matching funds, these old-line Republicans talked little of political philosophy, but recounted tales of friendship and loyalty.</p>
        <p>Like George Bush, some of them were bred in privileged New England society, attending Andover and Yale. Others knew Mr. Bush when he was a young oilman in dusty West Texas, or later, through Republican political circles.</p>
        <p>Even members of the Skull and Bones society at Yale, to which Mr. Bush and his father belonged, were solicited for donations by mail. ''It was pretty much like sending a letter to your fraternity brothers,'' said Peter Teeley, the Vice President's chief spokesman. But the society is so secretive that to this day, Skull and Bones members are hesitant to talk about Mr. Bush's membership.</p>
        <p>The fund-raisers, who prodded their own networks of former classmates, friends and business contacts for contributions, sounded more impressed with Mr. Bush's academic honors and records in school sports than his long resume of public service. At Yale, many recalled, Mr. Bush was both a Phi Beta Kappa and captain of the baseball team.</p>
        <p>''To get to be Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, that establishes brains,'' Mr. Gelb said of the Vice President. ''I worked pretty darn hard and I got two A's in my time at Yale.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gelb, the 61-year-old son of the founder of Clairol, recounted, as if it were yesterday, his first memory of Mr. Bush, then nicknamed Poppy. It was Mr. Gelb's second week as a 14-year-old first-year student at Andover when an older classmate, as part of an initiation of sorts, ordered him to move a big overstuffed couch.</p>
        <p>''When I told the guy I couldn't lift it anymore,'' Mr. Gelb said, ''he grabbed me and put my arm behind my back. I said, 'You can break it off, I can't lift that chair anymore.' ''</p>
        <p>''At that moment,'' he continued ''a guy walked by who very simply said, 'Leave the kid alone.' Kept right on walking. Zap! This guy dropped me like a hot potato, picked up the couch and walked away.</p>
        <p>''I asked a guy, 'Who was that?' He said, 'That was Poppy Bush. He's the greatest kid in the school.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, three years ahead at Andover, graduated that school year and Mr. Gelb never formally met him until 1978. But he has raised money for Mr. Bush's campaigns ever since that meeting, and, as finance co-chairman in New York, he supervised efforts to collect nearly $3 million.  Roots Go Deep With 'Diverse Gang'</p>
        <p>The campaign's other leading fund-raisers have also known the 63-year-old Vice President for years. Most helped him raise money for his 1980 campaign for the Republican nomination for President, and pitched in for the Reagan-Bush ticket four years later. While some in the group have volunteered for other candidates, most are Bush loyalists.</p>
        <p>Possibly because of Mr. Bush's longer career in public life, and his penchant for keeping in touch with old friends, his ties to his fund-raisers go much farther back than those of Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, his probable opponent in November.</p>
        <p>''The gang has as diverse a background as you could have, from small business to big business'' said Robert A. Mosbacher Sr., 61, a Houston oilman, yachtsman and longtime Republican fund-raiser who is the campaign's finance chairman. ''The glue that obviously holds it together is the strong respect and affection for the candidate.''</p>
        <p>Take, for example, 52-year-old Bobby Holt, another oilman who has known Mr. Bush for three decades. The motto of Mr. Holt, one of the campaign's most indefatigable fund-raisers, is ''you stroke 'em, you pluck 'em and you thank 'em.'' Mr. Holt is so close to the Vice President that he talks to him by telephone almost daily. But the conversation is more likely to be about Mr. Bush's springer spaniel than affairs of state.</p>
        <p>''He has enough political advice, enough financial advice,'' said Mr. Holt, who is also a rancher in Midland, Tex. ''He's listened to it all day long. So a lot of our conversation is, 'How's Millie doing?' Millie's the dog. 'Did you take Millie in the shower tonight, or did she bathe by herself?' We keep it light.''</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Gelb, three others attended Mr. Bush's alma maters, though not at the same time: Walter Curley, 65, a venture capital investor and former United States Ambassador to Ireland who graduated from Andover and Yale; Russell S. Reynolds Jr., 56, chairman of a leading New York-based executive recruitment firm, and a Yale graduate, and William R. Timken Jr., 49, head of a Canton, Ohio, roller-bearing company who graduated from Andover.</p>
        <p>Many of the others did not know Mr. Bush from childhood, but met him when he was chairman of the Republican National Committee at the close of the Nixon Administration: Alec P. Courtelis, 60, a major builder and Arabian-horse breeder based in Miami; Wally Ganzi Jr., 44, who runs Palm restaurants in many cities; Max M. Fisher, 80, a Detroit industrialist and longtime backer of Republican Presidents; Donald L. Bren, 55, a prominent developer in Southern California; Michael P. Galvin, 35, a partner in a prestigious Chicago law firm whose father, Robert, is the chairman of Motorola, and Henry R. Kravis, 44, a partner in the successful New York investment house of Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>These volunteers did more than raise money for the campaign. Most were active in collecting $12 million for Mr. Bush's political action committee, which enabled the Vice President to crisscross the country on political engagements, and to donate to local candidates long before he announced his own candidacy. Establishing those contacts proved valuable when the campaign actually began.</p>
        <p>Having completed fund-raising for the primaries, these same people are now raising at least $20 million more for the national and state parties to use in the general election. The Presidential campaigns in the general election are publicly financed, with each candidate receiving $46.1 million.</p>
        <p>Of the $23 million raised for the campaign, 70 percent came from fund-raising events or one-on-one solicitations, and the rest from political action committees and mail and telephone contribution drives, according to Margaret C. Alexander, the Bush finance director. There were an estimated 75,000 donors and the average contribution was $220. The maximum individual contribution permitted is $1,000 per candidate.</p>
        <p>Although the top fund-raisers should be credited for their diligence, there is another reason why they did well: Except for Mr. Timken in Ohio, they all hailed from states known for an abundance of political dollars.</p>
        <p>These men are all so well off that their contention that they do not raise money to bolster their business contacts is certainly believable, though they clearly relish being close to political power in Washington. Some, no doubt, would be advisers in a Bush Administration, whether in the Kitchen Cabinet or in the White House.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Holt, on the way to a dinner at Mr. Bush's home, bumped into Mr. Gelb in the lobby of a Washington hotel the other day, he proudly displayed the Secret Service pin on his lapel that he got from the campaign. And Mr. Ganzi decorates his Washington office with photographs of himself with Mr. Bush at the White House, bowling at Camp David, Md., and on Air Force Two, the Vice President's plane.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ganzi had never raised money until the current campaign. But he quickly established himself, personally bringing in nearly $1 million. The personable restaurateur was specially suited for the task: He has contacts in nearly a dozen cities where he has lived for a year or two while opening his restaurants.  Saving the Day Again Wins a Supporter</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Gelb, Mr. Ganzi recalled one incident that made him forever loyal to the Vice President. The two met in 1971 when Mr. Bush was the United States representative at the United Nations and would often lunch at the nearby Palm restaurant, which Mr. Ganzi managed.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, Mr. Ganzi recalled, hundreds of protesters at the United Nations were objecting to a reduction of United States aid to Israel. The demonstrators migrated outside the Palm, where Mr. Bush was dining.</p>
        <p>''I thought the restaurant was history,'' Mr. Ganzi said. ''This crowd was mad. Ambassador Bush got up from the table, no concern for his personal safety. We were all scared to death. He went out and addressed the crowd, and within five minutes the crowd peaceably dispersed. I just stood there with my mouth open, in awe of this man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's fund-raisers remain so loyal because the Vice President, an almost obsessive letter writer, is a master at letting his allies know he appreciates their efforts.</p>
        <p>''It's not a fun job that I do,'' said Mr. Curley, who has known Mr. Bush for about 50 years and is co-chairman of his fund-raising drive in New York. ''I just don't enjoy asking people that are as busy as I am to give me money. But George Bush is a fellow who doesn't expect all the support that he gets and is always refreshingly surprised about the depth of the loyalty he receives. He keeps in touch with everybody. He writes everybody. I mean everybody.''</p>
        <p>After 30 years of seeking contributions, Mr. Holt's fund-raising pal, Bob Mosbacher, said he is getting tired. ''But George Bush,'' he said, ''I wouldn't think of deserting him.''</p>
