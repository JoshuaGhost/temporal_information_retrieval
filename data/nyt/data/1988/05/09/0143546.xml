        <p>LEAD: One of the more persistent beliefs in sport is that the thoroughbred, while indisputably the fastest of horses, is also the fastest possible horse.</p>
        <p>One of the more persistent beliefs in sport is that the thoroughbred, while indisputably the fastest of horses, is also the fastest possible horse.</p>
        <p>The thoroughbred's superior speed over the distances it runs has, of course, been established on the race track. No other horse has been known to run the mile, for example, as fast as the fastest thoroughbred (1 minute 32 1/5 seconds).</p>
        <p>The presumed supremacy of the breed over its distances, however, is not based on fact, but on the assumption that the thoroughbred population, which traces its roots back to three acclaimed 18th-century sires, represents the ultimate genetic potential of equine speed and endurance.</p>
        <p>Since no other breeds have come along to mount a serious challenge, the assumption has not been disproved.</p>
        <p>The belief that refining a superior strain through selective inbreeding will lead to the maximum possible genetic advances has always enjoyed a certain elitist vogue.</p>
        <p>But that belief also runs counter to the science of animal genetics, which holds that the broader the base of the breeding population, the greater the potential development of a given characteristic, like speed.</p>
        <p>There is ample evidence that the thoroughbred industry's insistence on keeping the breed closed to new blood, as it has been since 1791, has hampered the development of faster horses. Graphs of the winning times of three classic English races dating to the 1850's, for example, show that while there were dramatic improvements for 80 years, there have been virtually none since the 1930's.</p>
        <p>But two Irish experts have concluded that there may still be some life left in the old breed. Writing in the April 21 issue of Nature, the British science magazine, Brian Gaffney, a geneticist at Trinity College in Dublin, and E. P. Cunningham, the director of the Agricultural Institute there, said their research indicated there was still room for further thoroughbred improvement, although not necessarily at the extremes.</p>
        <p>In other words, while the average throughbred may get faster, the fastest thoroughbreds may be about as fast as thoroughbreds will get.</p>
