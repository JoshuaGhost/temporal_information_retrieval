        <p>Christine Estabrook, who played the retarded Sheila in ''The Boys Next Door,'' and B. D. Wong, who made his Broadway debut in ''M. Butterfly,'' are the winners of the 1987-88 Clarence Derwent Award, which was announced Tuesday. The award, which is named for the actor and former president of the Actors' Equity Association, has been made each year since 1944 to ''the most promising female and male actors on the metropolitan scene.''</p>
        <p>Each winner will receive $1,000 and an engraved crystal trophy at a ceremony on June 10 at the Actors' Equity Association headquarters.</p>
        <p>Before appearing Off Broadway in ''The Boys Next Door,'' which closed last month, Ms. Estabrook played Clara in ''I'm Not Rappaport,'' opposite Hal Linden and Jack Klugman. She received Drama Desk nominations for her roles in ''Win/Lose/ Draw'' at the Provincetown Playhouse and ''North Shore Fish'' at the WPA Theater, and an Obie Award for ''Pastorale,'' at the Second Stage. Mr. Wong, before appearing in ''M. Butterfly'' at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, had roles in television and in the film ''The Karate Kid II.''</p>
        <p>The winners were selected by vote of a committee comprising the theater critics Walter Kerr, William A. Henry 3d, Edith Oliver, Douglas Watt, Clive Barnes and Frank Rich; the directors Morton DaCosta and Vivian Matalon; the actress Colleen Dewhurst, president of Actors' Equity; Peter Stone, president of the Dramatists Guild, and the producer Robert Whitehead.</p>
