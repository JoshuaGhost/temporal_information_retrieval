        <p>LEAD:  Taxing Assignment</p>
        <p>Taxing Assignment</p>
        <p>For months now, the Rev. Jesse Jackson has been campaigning from daybreak till midnight or even later, coast to coast, seven days a week. And the staff members, reporters and camera crews who travel with him have not had time to get haircuts or shoeshines, much less think about their taxes.</p>
        <p>So on Thursday, the day before the deadline for filing Federal income tax returns, a courier was dispatched to an Internal Revenue Service office in Manhattan to pick up copies of Form 4868, which must be filed by anyone who wants to have the deadline extended. One by one, members of the Jackson traveling party went past Room 901 at the Sheraton Centre Hotel to pick up the forms.</p>
        <p>''We knew we had to do something,'' said Delmarie Cobb, a campaign press assistant. ''I mean, I haven't had time to mess with my taxes, and neither has anybody else on the staff. We figured the press was in the same boat.'' Loyalty Priorities</p>
        <p>Blood may be thicker than water, but Presidential politics, it seems, is thicker than blood. In the highly combative New York Democratic primary, two brothers have enlisted as fund-raisers for rival candidates.</p>
        <p>Alan Blinken, a managing director of Wertheim Schroder &amp; Company, investment bankers, is chairman of the New York finance committee of Senator Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee. His older brother, Donald M. Blinken, chairman of the State University of New York, is a major fund-raiser in New York City for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.</p>
        <p>''We have great mutual respect for the other's candidate,'' Alan Blinken said. ''We just don't agree on the pecking order on the ticket.'' Cuomo Holdouts</p>
        <p>With Mayor Koch trumpeting his support of Senator Albert Gore Jr. all over town, it seemed as though almost all the prominent Democrats in New York had lined up behind the Tennessean or Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts or the Rev. Jesse Jackson in time to try to influence some voters in next Tuesday's Presidential primary.</p>
        <p>But, in fact, a thin red line of neutrals still stands with Governor Cuomo in making no public choice among the combatants. This group includes such notables as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine, Attorney General Robert Abrams, Assembly Speaker Mel Miller and the City Council president, Andrew Stein. They have only three days left to get aboard a bandwagon if they can discern one in motion. Fund-Raisers' Force</p>
        <p>Impac '88, the alliance of major Democratic fund-raisers that tried to become a force within the party in the current Presidential year, has plans to carry on, and its several dozen members have scheduled a meeting during the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. A number of the members backed Senator Albert Gore Jr. last year but did not succeed in getting the informal organization to unite behind the Tennessean's candidacy.</p>
        <p>Under Federal campaign laws, almost all the cost of the post-convention campaigns of both major-party candidates is borne by public funds, so private fund-raisers play only a minor role in the final heat of the Presidential race. But the convention meeting will provide an opportunity for Impac members who have not won delegate status and are not officials of a surviving campaign to make an appearance in Atlanta anyway.</p>
