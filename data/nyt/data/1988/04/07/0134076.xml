        <p>Iraq fired four missiles into Teheran today and said that it bombed eight other Iranian cities. Iran said that at least 37 civilians were killed and that it fired two missiles into Baghdad in retaliation.</p>
        <p>Iraq also said its planes hig a ''very large maritime target,'' a term that usually means a supertanker. It said the attack took place near the Iranian oil terminal on Lavan Island in the central Persian Gulf.</p>

        <p>Iran said that the Iraqi missiles hit residential districts in Teheran, killing 16 civilians and wounding scores more, and that 21 civilians werekilled and dozens wounded in Iraqi air raids on the other cities and towns.</p>
