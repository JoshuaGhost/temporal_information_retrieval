        <p>LEAD: A former director of the First Jersey National Corporation and her husband today settled Federal civil charges that they traded First Jersey stock while possessing non-public information about merger negotiations with a unit of National Westminster Bank P.L.C. of Britain last summer.</p>
        <p>A former director of the First Jersey National Corporation and her husband today settled Federal civil charges that they traded First Jersey stock while possessing non-public information about merger negotiations with a unit of National Westminster Bank P.L.C. of Britain last summer.</p>
        <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission charged Rita F. Leone, whose name was listed by First Jersey as Rita F. Girolamo on its list of directors, and her husband, Armand Leone Sr., in a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>They settled the charges without admitting or denying the allegations and were ordered to repay $774,302 in profits that may have been illegal and to pay a $480,916 penalty under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984.</p>
        <p>Julian Friedman, the Leones' lawyer, said the couple would have no comment.</p>
        <p>According to the complaint, Mrs. Leone, the vice chairman of the department of radiology at the New York Medical College, was informed of merger discussions between First Jersey and National Westminster on July 15, 1987, after a regular meeting of the board.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. contended that she had informed Mr. Leone, who then instructed the family's stockbroker to purchase shares for various family accounts.</p>
        <p>Within three weeks, according to the complaint, based on the information provided by Mrs. Leone, a total of 37,525 First Jersey shares had been purchased at an average price of between $54.375 and $55.625 a share.</p>
        <p>On Aug. 5, First Jersey announced the merger with National Westminster for $82 a share.</p>
