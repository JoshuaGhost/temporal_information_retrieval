        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There is more smoldering in Honduras than you tell in your April 11 news article on anger over the Honduran Government's decision to hand over a suspected drug trafficker to the United States. I led a United States military veterans' fact-finding delegation to Honduras in May last year. We found anti-United States and anti-Nicaraguan contra anger bordering on hatred. The dramatic rapid deployment of 3,200 American troops to Honduras last March, and the unconstitutional kidnapping of the accused drug trafficker, Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, in April blew the lid off a pot that was whistling.</p>
        <p>According to United States Embassy officials we met with a year ago, at least 7,000 U.S. troops have been stationed in Honduras for the last three years, with 3,000 more participating in maneuvers and training on Honduran soil. Penicillin-resistant gonorrhea is now epidemic in the country, and at least six Honduran prostitutes have been diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Bars and brothels have been built by the hundreds in the vicinity of our military encampments.</p>
        <p>Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, second only to Haiti. Many young, attractive Honduran women have been drawn to the wealth they can earn as prostitutes for gringo soldiers. Understandably, young Honduran males are outraged by this challenge to their macho image. There is a seething hostility between United States and Honduran soldiers, and there have been several murders.</p>
        <p>At least 35 contra camps and 11 United States-built bases and airstrips have displaced peasants and wealthy coffee plantation owners alike from their land without compensation. Anti-American and anti-contra graffiti decorate walls from the capital, Tegucigalpa, to rural villages like Danli, near the Nicaraguan border in the contra camp area.</p>
        <p>Honduran university students know that their President, Jose Azcona Hoyo, did not request more United States troops last March, but was overruled by the Reagan Administration. It was another in a long line of insults to their sovereignty. They know there have been no kidnapping attempts made on other accused drug traffickers such as Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega or, for that matter, high-ranking Honduran and contra military officers within an arm's reach and often in the company of United States Drug Enforcement and Central Intelligence agents.</p>
        <p>Last May 8, our delegation met with Manuel Acosta Bonilla. Mr. Acosta, an economist and lawyer, has served in the Honduran Senate, as Minister of Economics and Finance, and as president of the Honduran Bar Association's Commission on Human Rights. His words were of solemn foreboding.</p>
        <p>''If the Arias peace plan fails,'' he warned, ''there is nothing left on the table to negotiate. All that remains is a direct intervention by the United States. I believe sincerely that would immediately ignite a war all over Central America. It is an error to think the war could be localized. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this would not spread throughout all of South America and even Mexico. It could set fire to all of Latin America, and the cost would be astronomical.''</p>
        <p>But United States Embassy officials we spoke with in Honduras were oblivious to the gathering clouds. They told us there is very little anti-United States military or anti-contra sentiment among the Hondurans. There is no doubt, however, that Mr. Acosta sees and hears much that escapes the natural and technological listening devices of our Embassy.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Acosta: ''The traditionally pro-American sentiment of the Honduran people is evaporating much more quickly than the United States Embassy thinks. By and large, the people were unaware of the link between the United States and the contras, whom they view as contemptible. Now that link is becoming widely known.''</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, Mr. Acosta is not warmly welcomed at the United States Embassy in Tegucigalpa. He outspokenly and bitterly resents what he views as a virtual American military and contra occupation of his country and he condemns United States sponsorship of the Honduran military, which he believes is the greatest threat to true democracy in Honduras.
