        <p>Michael Jordan's spectacular feats as a scorer, defender and playmaker have made him a force to be reckoned with since he joined the Chicago Bulls in 1984. The feats have also nearly tripled Chicago's home attendance to an average of 18,042 fans per game and transformed the Bulls from also-rans into contenders.</p>
        <p>According to a report in The Chicago Tribune yesterday, Jordan will be rewarded next week with the most lucrative contract in professional team sports: $28 million over eight years, an average of $3.5 million a season. The report said that Jordan's agent, David Falk, and Jerry Reinsdorf, owner of the Bulls, had agreed on the contract, which includes performance incentives and would supersede a seven-year deal worth $6.2 million that Jordan signed as a rookie.
