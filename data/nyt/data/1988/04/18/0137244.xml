        <p>LEAD: The office of a New York City agency that provides help for indigent adults in Manhattan who cannot care for themselves is in a state of disarray, with widespread mismanagement and caseworkers who are often poorly trained and inexperienced, according to city investigators.</p>
        <p>The office of a New York City agency that provides help for indigent adults in Manhattan who cannot care for themselves is in a state of disarray, with widespread mismanagement and caseworkers who are often poorly trained and inexperienced, according to city investigators.</p>
        <p>Among the most ''disquieting'' discoveries, the investigators reported, was the ''wholesale backdating'' of case records, apparently because overwhelmed workers at the Manhattan office of the agency, Protective Services for Adults, were unable to keep up with a variety of state requirements, including the filing of monthly reports on clients. Man Froze to Death</p>
        <p>The investigation of the office, which regularly handles about 500 cases, was begun last January after an 80-year-old man under the agency's care froze to death in his unheated apartment in Greenwich Village. According to the report, caseworkers knew of the man's problems for eight months but did not make it a priority to get his heat restored.</p>
        <p>Because of the backdating of records, the investigators said they were unable to determine the precise sequence of events. The report said, ''This constant backdating calls into question the accuracy of the entire case record.'' 'A Failure of Management'</p>
        <p>''The supervisory structure of P.S.A. is in disarray and led to an inexperienced worker dealing with a situation she was unequipped to handle,'' the report said. ''This is as much a failure of management as of casework.''</p>
        <p>The results of the investigation were reported in yesterday's editions of New York Newsday. At a news conference yesterday at which the report was made public, the city's Human Resources Administrator said that because of the findings, he had ordered an investigation of Protective Services in the city's other four boroughs. He also said he had referred the Greenwich Village case to the Manhattan District Attorney's office.</p>
        <p>Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, said yesterday that ''it is an open investigation.'' He said investigators were trying to determine if there was any neglect and ''if there was, does it rise to criminal intent?'' Disciplinary Action</p>
        <p>The Human Resources Administrator, William J. Grinker, also said agency lawyers had been authorized to begin disciplinary action ''against those persons within H.R.A. who mismanaged the case.''</p>
        <p>''The investigation,'' he said, ''will go wherever and as high as it leads.'' That, he added, could include him. The report said a supervisor at the Manhattan office had ordered the backdating of reports, which are supposed to be filed monthly. But the name of the supervisor was removed from the copy of the report made public.</p>
        <p>Asked about the report yesterday, the director of the Manhattan office of Protective Services, Sheila Gorsky, said yesterday: ''Backdating implies that I told my worker to lie. Nobody tells anyone to lie. But I can't go any farther than that.'' 'Lack of Knowledge'</p>
        <p>But the investigators - led by the agency's general counsel, James L. Capoziello - said many of the problems began at the central office of Protective Services, which it said apparently had a ''lack of knowledge'' of what was occurring in the borough offices.</p>
        <p>The official in charge of the Office of Adult Services, the parent office of Protective Services, Gregory M. Kaladjian, said the report of backdating ''came as a surprise'' because an audit of the agency last summer by the State Social Services Department found that ''we were in pretty good shape.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grinker said Mr. Kaladjian was heading a review of agency policy to determine immediate ways to strengthen the Protective Services program by improving the training and staffing of the agency's offices. The agency provides a variety of services for 1,500 adults - generally elderly and poor - who are considered unable to survive on their own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grinker said he received the report last month and had then ordered the citywide review of the agency. He had not intended to release the ''internal confidential'' report, he added, and did so only after it was obtained by Newsday.</p>
        <p>According to the report, poor training and inexperience both played significant roles in the case of the Greenwich Village man, Joseph Stilletto.</p>
        <p>''A complicating factor in the Stilletto case,'' the report said, ''was that it was assigned to an inexperienced caseworker in a unit with an equally inexperienced supervisor.'' The names of the two workers had been removed from copies of the report made public yesterday. Problems in Supervision</p>
        <p>Whether the mismanagement of Mr. Stilletto's case contributed to his death, the investigators said, was ''impossible to determine.'' But it found these problems with the office's supervision of his case:</p>
        <p>* A ''fatally flawed'' case plan that failed to make a priority of addressing the lack of heat in Mr. Stilletto's apartment. Instead of taking immediate action to have his heat restored, the report said, caseworkers were working to establish a rent-payment plan and have meals delivered to his home.</p>
        <p>* A ''total failure of supervision'' of the caseworker.</p>
        <p>* Missing and ''fraudulently'' dated records.</p>
        <p>* ''Wholesale backdating,'' of case records at the Manhattan office, where caseworkers have about 30 clients each and are required to visit them at least once a month.</p>
        <p>* An ''unacceptably low'' level of training.</p>
        <p>* Supervisors in the Manhattan office signing records without reading them.</p>
        <p>In the Stilletto case, the agency was aware of his situation for eight months before he was found frozen to death in his garbage-filled studio apartment, at 16 Abingdon Square.</p>
        <p>At the time of Mr. Stilletto's death, the electricity, water and heat had been disconnected to the apartment. Large Hole in Window</p>
        <p>A large hole was found in the apartment's window. Neighbors said a half-empty beer can near the window was frozen. The temperature that morning was 13 degrees.</p>
        <p>He was also years behind in his rent payments on the $90-a-month apartment, which was littered with filthy clothing and sheets, soiled mattresses and paint chips.</p>
        <p>The day his body was found, a cleaning service dispatched by the city's Human Resources Administration was scheduled to begin cleaning the apartment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stilletto, who was a short, bearded man, was well known in the West Village, neighbors said. Over the years he had held odd jobs in the neighborhood, including as a porter in a restaurant and helping out at a card shop.</p>
