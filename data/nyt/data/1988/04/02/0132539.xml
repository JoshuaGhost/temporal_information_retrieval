        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert R. Axelrod (letter, March 5), who attacks regulation of fishing and traffic in wild animals in the Amazon region, shows poor understanding of fish ecology in flood-plain and riverine forests. The pioneering work of Michael Goulding has proven that fish play a critical role in dispersing seeds in these ecosystems. Many fish depend on tree fruits for sustenance, while the trees rely on fish to disperse their seeds out of the still waters of the flood-plain forests and against the river currents.</p>
        <p>Examination of the stomach contents of piranhas has shown that what Mr. Axelrod dismisses as ''ridiculous theory'' is fact. Some species of piranhas ingest large quantities of seeds, although they are primarily seed predators. At a certain time of year, Amazonian fishermen know the species of fish that can be caught under given species of trees. They use seeds or fruits for bait.</p>
        <p>Collecting and shipping tropical fish can be a successful enterprise in the developing world, although it is absurd to think they are ''the largest single replenishable resource available to most third world countries,'' compared with plants of the tropical forest. Mr. Axelrod notwithstanding, regulating the traffic in wildlife is needed to keep resources replenishable.</p>
        <p>He laments the work of ''do-gooders,'' which has supposedly diminished the export of Amazonian animals, thereby exacerbating the misery of ''starving villagers.'' Most of these species of animals are collected in regions where relatively undisturbed habitats predominate and where few people go hungry. From more than five years' experience with the Arawete, Asurini, Guaja, Kaapor and Tembe societies in the area, we can say that these Indians export no animal species for sale. Their diets are more than adequate, the result of strategies of fish, game and plant management evolved over thousands of years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Axelrod observes that the Indians ''kill everything without thought of wildlife conservation.'' Indians certainly do not kill everything, as any anthropologist who has worked in Amazonia knows, if only because the Indians have taboos on numerous game and fish species, as well as ritual injunctions that seem to control the exploitation of these irreplaceable resources. If the Indians only know how to ''conserve their own lives,'' they have clearly learned how to do so without selling wildlife and impoverishing Amazonian forests at the same time. WILLIAM BALEE</p>
