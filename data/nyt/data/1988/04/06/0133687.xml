        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>One of the keys to the success of waste recycling in New York State will be money. That is why it is important that the state enact, after years of debate, Governor Cuomo's legislative proposal to return to the public $60 million in unclaimed deposits, retained by the beverage industry when people fail to return beer and soda containers on which they have paid 5-cent deposits. The proposal is part of the Governor's program on solid waste problems.</p>
        <p>The average return rate for beer and soda containers is about 80 percent. Therefore, the beverage industry is keeping about one nickel of every five that citizens pay in deposits. Since the bottle bill went into effect in 1983, deposits retained by the industry amount to more than $300 million. When combined with recycling income and price increases, these funds represent a windfall for the beverage industry.</p>
        <p>The public needs this money. We are faced with a solid waste crisis, and recycling is the key to solving it. Recycling is in the long run cost-effective; however, it takes money to get recycling started.</p>
        <p>Governor Cuomo's program will use the people's nickels to find the capital expenses to begin recycling programs. Of the $60 million yearly that can be recovered from the beverage industry, $40 million will be distributed directly to local governments per capita. The remaining $20 million will be awarded to localities competitively.</p>
        <p>The state's solid waste management plan sets a goal of reducing the municipal waste stream by 50 percent by 1989 through reduction and recycling, which is environmentally sound and will reduce the cost to local governments of siting new disposal facilities. In financing recycling, we must not overlook the logical and rightful recovery of the people's nickels. THOMAS C. JORLING  Commissioner of Environmental  Conservation  Albany, March 16, 1988</p>
