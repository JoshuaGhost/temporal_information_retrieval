        <p>LEAD: Trying to forge a fusion campaign for mayor, New York City Republican leaders have decided to seek a Democrat to nominate for mayor next year, having ruled out for now the potentially strongest Republican candidate, United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Trying to forge a fusion campaign for mayor, New York City Republican leaders have decided to seek a Democrat to nominate for mayor next year, having ruled out for now the potentially strongest Republican candidate, United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>The Republican leaders and elected officials have met twice in the last six weeks -the second time on Thursday over breakfast at the Sheraton Center hotel - to get an early start on the campaign and to avoid the political embarrassment of recent mayoral elections, when their candidates have been badly beaten. The meetings were initiated by the state Republican chairman, Anthony J. Colavita.</p>
        <p>They have decided that for now it would be wise to support a Democrat who could enter the Democratic primary against Mayor Koch next September assured of Republican endorsement, as well as Liberal and Conservative Party support if the coalition idea appeals to those parties. Mr. Koch has said he plans to seek a fourth term. Independent Images</p>
        <p>The Democrats who are said to be the most appealing to the Republicans are Richard Ravitch of Manhattan, the businessman and former Metropolitan Transportation Authority chairman who is about to leave his post as chairman of the City Charter Revision Commission, and Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn, the state special prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Both have independent images, the Republican leaders said, and are not as closely identified with the Democratic Party as other potential mayoral candidates, such as City Council President Andrew J. Stein, City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and the Manhattan Borough President, David N. Dinkins.</p>
        <p>The nominations for City Council president and city comptroller would go to a Republican and a member of one of the minor political parties if they were part of the coalition.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders intend to discuss their plans with Liberal and Conservative Party leaders as well as officials of unions representing municipal employees, hospital workers and teamsters. These groups have been in the forefront of an effort to put together an anti-Koch coalition for the Democratic primary.</p>
        <p>In the past, Republicans used fusion, or coalition, mayoral campaigns to overcome the traditionally strong Democratic majority in New York City. Mayors John V. Lindsay and Fiorello H. La Guardia each won with support from minor parties. Several Reasons</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who has prosecuted more corrupt politicians, almost all of them Democrats, than any Federal prosecutor in recent memory, was ruled out for now for several reasons.</p>
        <p>The Republican Party and public officials believe that he would not be given the necessary Democratic Party permission, under the state's Wilson-Pakula Law, for a non-Democrat to enter the Democratic primary.</p>
        <p>They have also approached Mr. Giuliani through his chief assistant, Dennison Young Jr., and were told that Mr. Giuliani would not talk about the mayoral or any other political campaign while he held his present post.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is expected to resign within the next two or three months to return to private law practice. He has consistently maintained that it would be inappropriate for a Federal prosecutor to be talking politics until he left office. 'Not in the Formula'</p>
        <p>''He's not in the formula right now,'' a Republican leader said. ''We want to get down to business fast and not wait for anyone.'' He recalled that Mr. Giuliani had kept the party waiting for months late last year and early this year while he decided whether to challenge Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic Senator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani eventually rejected the opportunity and as a result the party had to turn in desperation to a candidate who was relatively unknown politically, Robert R. McMillan. Mr. McMillan was defeated by a record-breaking 2 million votes last Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has also angered some of the Republican leaders with his possible role in the investigation and ultimate Federal indictment of State Senator Richard E. Schermerhorn, a Newburgh Republican, on income tax evasion charges. Mr. Schermerhorn, who was already facing charges of mail and bank fraud, was defeated last Tuesday in a campaign in which his indictment was the major issue. Similar Allegations</p>
        <p>Mr. Schermerhorn had said F.B.I. agents had tried to persuade him to cooperate in an attempt to entrap the State Senate majority leader, Warren M. Anderson, Republican of Binghamton, in a purported scheme to provide legislative employees to work in the Schermerhorn campaign on state time. Similar allegations led to the indictment of Mr. Anderson's Democratic counterpart, the Senate minority leader, Manfred Ohrenstein of Manhattan, by a state grand jury.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schermerhorn said he refused to cooperate with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and maintained that he was indicted as a result of that refusal.</p>
        <p>Republican county chairmen said the party leaders wanted to know what role Mr. Giuliani played in the F.B.I. effort to entrap Mr. Anderson.</p>
        <p>Mr. Young, the Giuliani spokesman, has said that ''there is no truth to Schermerhorn's statement that he was asked to set up Senator Anderson.'' Strained Relations</p>
        <p>Another problem for Mr. Giuliani is his strained relations with Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, the state's leading Republican, whose help, at least in fund raising, the Republican leaders will seek.</p>
        <p>The Republican officials had agreed among themselves not to discuss their plans until contacts were made with the other political parties and anti-Koch elements. Thus, the officials who talked of their plans with a reporter asked not to be identified.</p>
        <p>About 15 party leaders and officials have been part of the discussions. Among them are five Republican county chairmen in New York City, Mr. Colavita, Republican state legislators and members of Congress and the only elected Republican city official, City Councilwoman Susan Molinari of Staten Island. Her father, Representative Guy V. Molinari, is also a member of the group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes and Mr. Ravitch could not be reached for comment yesterday, but both have indicated that they are interested in running for mayor.</p>
