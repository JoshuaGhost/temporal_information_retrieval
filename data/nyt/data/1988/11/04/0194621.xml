        <p>LEAD: A marble head of Achilles, once displayed at the J. Paul Getty Museum as 2,300-year-old antiquity, is probably the work of a 20th-century art student working from a plaster model, museum officials have said.</p>
        <p>A marble head of Achilles, once displayed at the J. Paul Getty Museum as 2,300-year-old antiquity, is probably the work of a 20th-century art student working from a plaster model, museum officials have said.</p>
        <p>The museum announced in August that the head was a fake, and officials now say it probably was copied from a cast made of a head in the National Archeological Museum in Athens.</p>
        <p>The head also was apparently rejected as a fake in the early 1930's by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Los Angeles Times reported today.</p>
        <p>A Paris art dealer, Michel de Bry, sold the piece to the Getty in 1979 for an undisclosed price. Published reports put its value at around $2.5 million. The Getty had said it was believed to be the work of the Greek sculptor and architect Skopas.</p>
