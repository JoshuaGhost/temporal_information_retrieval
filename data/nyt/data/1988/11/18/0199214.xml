        <p>LEAD: About 10,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in the capital of Kosovo Province today after the forced resignations of two provincial leaders accused of tolerating Albanian nationalism.</p>
        <p>About 10,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated in the capital of Kosovo Province today after the forced resignations of two provincial leaders accused of tolerating Albanian nationalism.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said the protesters marched through Pristina, the provincial capital 220 miles south of Belgrade, chanting their opposition to the ouster of Kacusa Jasari, the Kosovo Communist Party president, and Azem Vlasi, Mrs. Jasari's predecessor and a member of the provincial Politburo.</p>
        <p>The two had been opposed by the Serbian Communist Party leader, who has been trying to bring the Albanian-dominated province under tighter Serbian control. Although administratively part of the republic of Serbia, Kosovo enjoys wide autonomy under the Constitution adopted under Tito, who died in 1980.</p>
        <p>The resignations came at a session of the provincial party's Central Committee, convened to discuss continuing tensions between ethnic Albanians, who form the majority in Kosovo, and minority Serbs and Montenegrins, who say they are being harassed.</p>
        <p>The protests, including a march earlier today by 4,000 miners, were the first by Yugoslav Albanians since bloody ethnic riots in 1981 in which at least nine people were killed.</p>
        <p>The miners marched into Pristina from Titova Mitrovica, a dozen miles away, breaking through a cordon of riot police sent to turn them back.</p>
