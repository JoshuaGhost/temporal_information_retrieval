        <p>LEAD: The 1988 Presidential election marked a decided shift in the strength of Democratic Party to the Midwest and the West. It also confirmed that the ''Solid South,'' once a Democratic bastion, is now solidly Republican in Presidential voting and may well stay that way for some time.</p>
        <p>The 1988 Presidential election marked a decided shift in the strength of Democratic Party to the Midwest and the West. It also confirmed that the ''Solid South,'' once a Democratic bastion, is now solidly Republican in Presidential voting and may well stay that way for some time.</p>
        <p>The election also confirmed a racial polarization in American politics that began in 1964: for a quarter of a century, the Republican vote in Presidential elections has almost exclusively been white and, barring some dramatic change, it is likely to stay that way.</p>
        <p>But the election also marked some major shifts from recent electoral history, pointing to openings for the Democrats and weak spots for the Republicans. Democrats Gain in West</p>
        <p>The most important of these shifts is that the Democratic Party is now competitive with Republicans on the West Coast and very nearly so in the Mountain States. With the South and the West likely to gain electoral votes after the 1990 census, the West might provide the Democrats with a way of making up for their lost Southern base.</p>
        <p>The Democrats are now also thoroughly competitive in the Midwest; they carried three Midwestern states on Tuesday and came very close in Illinois.</p>
        <p>The result is that the Democrats might now be in a position to put together electoral majorities without the South, as the Republican Party did regularly between 1860 and 1928.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats say these gains in the midst of defeat portend future victories, much as Alfred E. Smith's gains in the big cities in 1928 foreshadowed the New Deal coalition created in 1932 or as Barry Goldwater's Southern strength in 1964 foreshadowed the Republicans' future in the South.</p>
        <p>In fact, Tuesday's returns confirmed the racial and regional polarization that began in 1964, when Mr. Goldwater opposed the Civil Rights Act that was shepherded into law by Lyndon B. Johnson, his Democratic foe.</p>
        <p>Despite fears among Democrats that black voters might abandon Michael S. Dukakis in substantial numbers this year, the Massachusetts Governor won the black vote by 86 percent to 12 percent, according to a New York Times/ CBS News Poll. Rights Move Hurt Democrats</p>
        <p>But President Johnson's embrace of civil rights also led to substantial white defections from the Democratic Party, especially in the South. They continued this year, with a vengeance.</p>
        <p>Among white Southerners, Mr. Bush won 67 percent of the vote to only 32 percent for the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Bush won among Southern white men by 70 percent to 29 percent.</p>
        <p>The gap between the white South and the rest of the country was especially pronounced among voters who are better-off financially. In the South, whites earning more than $25,000 a year voted for Mr. Bush by 72 percent to 27 percent. Elsewhere, the vote of the relatively well-off was tighter: 59 percent for Mr. Bush, 40 percent for Mr. Dukakis. Among lower-income whites, the regional gap was quite small.</p>
        <p>The question is: how much of this pattern can be explained by racial feeling and how much by the South's generally conservative social values?</p>
        <p>Many liberals say that racial politics was clearly a factor and that Mr. Bush, by highlighting the case of a black man who raped a white woman while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison, heightened racial feelings even more. Racial Intolerance Played Role</p>
        <p>Andrew Kohut, president of the Gallup Organization, said racial intolerance clearly played a role in the voting. He said Gallup Polls conducted for the Times-Mirror Company showed that about a third of Mr. Bush's strong supporters scored high on scale measuring racial intolerance.</p>
        <p>But Merle Black, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said racial issues were only one aspect of Mr. Dukakis's overwhelming defeat in the white South. There also the issues of military strength and patriotism, captured in the controversy over Mr. Dukakis's veto of a Massachusetts bill requiring teachers to lead students in the Pledge of Allegiance.</p>
        <p>The Gallup/Times-Mirror study found that the pledge issue was far more potent in the South than elsewhere in the country. Asked if the pledge issue had been very important to them, 29 percent of Eastern voters and 37 percent of voters in the West and Midwest said yes. But in the South, 51 percent said yes.</p>
        <p>Finally, both Mr. Black and Lance Tarrance, a Republican poll taker with experience in the South, said the changing demography of the South is taking a basically favorable turn for Republicans. Most of the economic and population growth in the South, they said, is in suburban areas that tend to vote Republican.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis's resounding defeat in the South raised agonizing questions for Democrats about whether the biracial coalitions that are necessary for Democratic victories are a thing of the past. Most who analyze southern voting think that, in fact, biracial politics is alive and well and that the defeat was more a personal one for Mr. Dukakis.</p>
        <p>No single election result made this point more forcefully than the landslide re-election of Representative Mike Espy, a Democrat who in 1986 became the first black to win a House seat in Mississippi since Reconstruction. Mr. Espy won re-election with two-thirds of the overall vote and about 40 percent of the white vote. Mr. Espy ran well ahead of Mr. Dukakis in most white precincts. Pocketbooks Overshadow Color</p>
        <p>Asked to explain this, Mr. Espy said in a telephone interview that white voters in his district had become personally comfortable with him and voted for his record on economic issues. ''If people are thinking about their pocketbooks,'' said Mr. Espy, ''they often forget about color.''</p>
        <p>If Southern particularism and racial politics were the major themes to emerge from this year's voting, there were other important regional trends as well.</p>
        <p>The most striking was the rise of the Democrats in the West. Mr. Dukakis gained substantial ground throughout the region since Walter F. Mondale was on the ballot in 1984. Mr. Dukakis carried Oregon and Washington, and came close - winning 47 percent or more - in California, Mew Mexico, Montana. Even in bedrock Republican states such as Idaho, the number of voters going for Mr. Dukakis this year was up from those who voted for Mr. Mondale - in Idaho's case to 37 percent from 26 percent.</p>
        <p>There were many factors behind the shift, including a steady drift to the Democrats in statewide elections among younger, middle-class voters because of foreign policy and environmental issues. In 1988, that shift could be seen in Presidential voting as well, especially among the West's upper middle-income voters, who were more likely to vote for Mr. Dukakis than their counterparts elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The prospect of a Democratic West is likely to play a major role in the intra-party debates between now and 1992. Many Western Democrats say the party should worry less about trying to win back an inhospitable South and think more about expanding its beachhead in West.</p>
        <p>Finally, the crisis on the nation's farms and in its industrial cities has helped forge a new alliance in the Midwest that could prove potent for a future Democratic candidate if the coalition can be held together.</p>
        <p>Iowa, for example, once a reliably Republican state, has become one of the most Democratic states in the union and gave Mr. Dukakis one of his best majorities on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis also carried Wisconsin and Minnesota, very nearly carried Illinois, and ran respectably in South Dakota and Michigan. Together, these states have 76 electoral votes and could provide the Democrats with a solid base in the nation's midsection from which they could move both East - to New York, Pennsylvania and New England - and West.</p>
