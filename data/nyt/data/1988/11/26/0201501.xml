        <p>LEAD: The world is still seeking a better mousetrap. Even with thousands of mousetrap designs, ranging from spring-loaded jaws to glue snares to poisoned cheese, a new mousetrap patent appears every few weeks.</p>
        <p>The world is still seeking a better mousetrap. Even with thousands of mousetrap designs, ranging from spring-loaded jaws to glue snares to poisoned cheese, a new mousetrap patent appears every few weeks.</p>
        <p>The new inventions come in roughly two types: traps that kill more effectively and traps that kill more tastefully. To be sure, mousetrap inventors say, the pathways to their doors have not been trampled with customers. But they also think that the current state of the art bears improvement.</p>
        <p>Consider the Electric Mouse Exterminator, invented by Claude G. Coots, a textile worker in Mentone, Ala. Mr. Coots said he got the idea after chasing a rat without success; it escaped through a hole it had chewed in one of his walls.</p>
        <p>The inventor stripped a 120-volt electric cord and stretched the bare wires across the hole. When the rat emerged, the wires touched its nose and neatly electrocuted it.</p>
        <p>The inventor's new mousetrap is a small rectangular box, with an entrance at one end and bait at the other. To reach the bait, mice have to poke their snouts between two horizontal wires. When they do, they close an electric circuit and die instantly. The device plugs into a standard wall outlet, and is configured to protect humans from accidental shocks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coots, who has yet to market his invention, said the device should cost less than $10.</p>
        <p>He received patent 4,780,985.  *</p>
        <p>Clifford R. Feldman, a student at Chicago Medical School, decided that the world did not need a new mousetrap as much as it needed to make the original spring-loaded trap more tidy.</p>
        <p>''With all the jillions of mousetraps, the best one is still the simplest,'' Mr. Feldman said. But, he said, such traps can produce an unpleasant sight because they typically crush the rodent's neck. Mr. Feldman added a small plastic bag, attached to an extension of the trap's bar, that envelops the animal when the device is triggered. Users can simply flip the trap over and remove the bag without looking at their quarry.</p>
        <p>The inventor added that people who feel squeamish about killing mice can modify his device so that it only bags the animal for later removal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feldman said he hopes to market his invention after he completes medical school.</p>
        <p>He received patent 4,779,374.  *</p>
        <p>Neatness also preoccupied Richard W. Copenhaver, a former state patrolman living in Kansas, Okla., who recently patented a pre-set, pre-baited, disposable trap.</p>
        <p>''I thought, there's just got to be a better mousetrap,'' said Mr. Copenhaver, who has devoted himself full time to marketing his invention.</p>
        <p>The trap consists of a long springloaded box with an opening at one end and bait at the other end. In order for a mouse to get to the bait, it must chew through an adhesive strip blocking the way midway through the box. When the strip breaks, springs pull the two ends of the box together and block the opening. The inventor said the plastic trap suffocates the animal within a few hours.</p>
        <p>Mr. Copenhaver acknowledged that buyers were not yet beating a path to his door, either. ''It's easy to come up with ideas, but you've really got to hustle on the marketing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Copenhaver, who said his invention should sell for $2.50, received patent 4,769,942.  *</p>
        <p>A similar trap, invented by Cornelius Chow of La Jolla, Calif., uses gravity to trap mice without actually killing them outright. The trap consists of a curved tube, weighted so that the front end rests flat on the ground and the rear end curves up. When a mouse enters in search of bait at the rear end, the tube rocks backward and a door slams shut. Mr. Chow received patent 4,744,170.  *</p>
        <p>But some inventors think such approaches are cruel, because they often leave the mouse to die a slow death by starvation, thirst or suffocation.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, James Smith of Ontario, Canada, won patent approval for a mousetrap that knocks out its targets with an anesthetic, allowing them to suffocate peacefully.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's invention consists of a slender tube, with bait mounted on a hook inside at the far end. The hook is connected to a rod that holds open a door over the entranceway. When the mouse plucks the cheese, the rod slips loose and the door swings shut. When that happens, the door breaks a small glass vial containing the anesthetic, which puts the mouse out of its misery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith received patent 4,763,439.</p>
