        <p>LEAD: ''Miracle of miracles,'' Vice President Bush said sarcastically. ''Headlines. Read all about it. My opponent finally, after knocking me in the debate, called himself the big 'L,' called himself a liberal.''</p>
        <p>''Miracle of miracles,'' Vice President Bush said sarcastically. ''Headlines. Read all about it. My opponent finally, after knocking me in the debate, called himself the big 'L,' called himself a liberal.''</p>
        <p>Delivering this line to cheering crowds in Louisville, Ky., St. Louis and Kansas City, with respective accompaniments of bluegrass music, rock-and-roll and African drums, a pugnacious George Bush mocked Gov. Michael S. Dukakis today for belatedly acknowledging his ideological heritage.</p>
        <p>On a whistle-stop tour through California's Central Valley on Sunday, Mr. Bush's Democratic opponent accepted the label that Republicans had been trying to pin on him. But Mr. Dukakis said he was ''a liberal in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, courting the votes of conservative Democrats with a promise of ''sensible mainstream leadership,'' also offered a reply to Mr. Dukakis's suggestion Sunday that they debate again on the night before the election.</p>
        <p>''The Governor of Massachusetts should debate himself,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It could be entertaining. The Old Left or the New Left. He can go out there and debate each other.''</p>
        <p>Then, the Vice President concluded, the question would be asked, '' 'Will the real liberal please stand up?' And God knows what would happen, I'll tell you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dukakis had once tried to criticize the Republicans by charging that they were so unconcerned about running up deficits and cutting programs for the poor that their campaign song should be ''Don't Worry, Be Happy.'' Antique Train and a Hit Song</p>
        <p>At a rousing rally of 1,500 people at a converted train station in St. Louis, Mr. Bush rode in on an antique train as the band played that feel-good, reggae-style hit song.</p>
        <p>Despite all the criticism about the negative tone of the 1988 campaign, Mr. Bush seemed to be relishing a final chance to pound all of his points home. ''They can dish it out but they can't take it,'' he said of the Democrats, ''and I'm going to keep dishing it out.''</p>
        <p>On Air Force Two, the Vice President told reporters that he ''feels good'' about the last week of the campaign. Although his aides have been trying to paint the race as closer in recent days, Mr. Bush has denied that his lead has shrunk.</p>
        <p>In an interview tonight on the NBC Evening News with Tom Brokaw, Mr. Bush was asked if he was proud of his campaign as it had been conducted so far.</p>
        <p>''Yes I am,'' the Vice President replied. ''You're looking at a guy that was getting pounded out there. And I think things have gone better for me. And you know there's ups and downs in terms of pride, but I'm very proud. I think my message is getting out there on the issues and I think that we've moved in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>On the liberal issue, Mr. Brokaw asked Mr. Bush if he thought that ''the young voters of this country understand that liberals, after all, led the way on Social Security, on Medicaire and civil rights legislation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush replied: ''I don't know. Certainly, some individuals who were of a liberal persuasion of that nature deserve credit.'' New TV Commercial Begins</p>
        <p>Reacting quickly to Mr. Dukakis's declaration of his liberal leanings, the Bush campaign began a new television commercial intended to take advantage of it. While the Governor sought to link himself with Roosevelt, Truman and Kennedy, the Bush commercial tried to link him to three other Democrats. ''Why would we want to go back to the tax-and-spend policies of eight years ago?'' the ad asked, showing pictures of George McGovern, Jimmy Carter and Walter F. Mondale.</p>
        <p>At the get-out-the vote rallies, he asked his Republican supporters to ''go to polls, do that grubby but important work of telephoning and getting people to the polls on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>He said he was making a special plea to the Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan in the last two elections.</p>
        <p>''I know a lot of mainstream Americans no longer feel represented by the Democratic Party,'' Mr. Bush said. ''And so my pitch here in the last eight days is to those good Democrats, the rank and file, the silent majority, I tell them, 'Have hope, have confidence and if you feel abandoned, remember there is a Presidential candidate this year who has a program representing your vision of America.' '' 'Nightmare on Main Street'</p>
        <p>Responding to Mr. Dukakis's latest attempt to present himself as the candidate of the working man, the Republicans have been mocking the Democrat's claim that he is for Main Street while Mr. Bush is for Easy Street.</p>
        <p>Bush supporters in St. Louis held up signs reading, ''Nightmare on Main Street, starring Michael Dukakis,'' while the Democratic protesters screamed: ''No more hot checks! The Duke is with us on Main Street!''</p>
        <p>''Let me tell you about Main Street,'' Mr. Bush began. Saying he had talked to people all over the country, he asserted that ''no one has ever come up to me and said, 'Hey, I want to get the deficit down - please raise my taxes.' ''</p>
        <p>He promised that he would continue President Reagan's program of economic expansion ''until every man and woman that wants a job has a job,'' adding, ''You see, I am an optimist about the United States, and I admit it.''</p>
        <p>Across the street from the Bush rally, Dukakis supporters served a free lunch to homeless people as a way of dramatizing their contention that the Republicans have said little about affordable housing and the homeless.</p>
