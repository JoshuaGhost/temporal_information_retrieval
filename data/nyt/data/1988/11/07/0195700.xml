        <p>LEAD: The 105th National Horse Show completed its run at Madison Square Garden last night with 31 jumpers fighting poor footing, fatigue and unnerving fences in the $50,000 Big Apple Grand Prix.

        <p>The 105th National Horse Show completed its run at Madison Square Garden last night with 31 jumpers fighting poor footing, fatigue and unnerving fences in the $50,000 Big Apple Grand Prix. The event was won by Hap Hansen after he soared over eight obstacles without mishap in a time of 36.89 seconds atop Zadok in a seven-horse jump-off.</p>
        <p>''The course was very big and very wide,'' said Hansen, who won the President's Cup Grand Prix in Washington last weekend. ''You had no room to breathe out there.''</p>
        <p>Last night's victory also brought Hansen the title of Leading Open Jumper Rider at the show. Solid jump-offs from Katie Monahan Prudent, who finished second, and Joe Fargis, fourth on Mill Pearl, guaranteed the United States Equestrian Team first place in the international standing. George Lindemann Jr. was third on Jupiter. Suffered Broken Leg</p>
        <p>Hansen, a 35-year-old rider from Encinitas, Calif., who returned to the circuit in August after suffering a broken leg this spring, and his 7-year-old Dutch-bred stallion edged out Prudent on Special Envoy.</p>
        <p>Prudent captured the International Rider title here and solidified her grip on a third American Grandprix Association rider-of-the-year award. Special Envoy, the 10-year-old Hanoverian owned by Pamela Harriman, remained the leading horse-of-the-year contender.</p>
        <p>Prudent watched her husband, Henri, a member of the French team, skid into a spill with his horse, The King. She also saw Lisa Carlsen's jump-off effort fail when the Canadian rider's usually nimble horse, Kahlua, fell while attempting a turn.</p>
        <p>''The footing's been terrible all week,'' Prudent said, ''but when you complain to the Garden management about it, they just tell you not to make such sharp turns. It's a disgrace.'' The Last Roundup? Whether the National will be at Madison Square Garden for its 106th year remains under negotiation. This year it cost $1 million to stage the week-long event, which last year lost more than $80,000. Without increased support from sponsors or higher gate receipts, the show may decide New York City has become too costly. The Meadowlands is the only other site under consideration.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the day, the Rolex-Maclay National Championship, the most prestigious competition for junior riders and a Garden fixture since 1933, was secured with a calm and collected ride by 18-year-old Christy Conard of Bradenton, Fla.</p>
        <p>Conard had traveled here four times before, but her lack of a polished mount for the equitation phase of the testing prevented her from joining the finalists. Two years ago, her horse died less than two months before the Maclay finals. Yesterday, she held second place among the 21 finalists heading into the final test on the elegant black thoroughbred Night Moves, which she had borrowed from his owners.</p>
        <p>An impeccable ride in the final test, which sent the riders onto an eight-obstacle jump course and required three designated changes of lead at a canter, moved Conard into first place.</p>
        <p>''Anyone who hurried or was nervous on that course was in trouble,'' said Christine Schlusemeyer, part of a group that took trainer-of-the-year honors thanks to their role in Conard's victory. Schlusemeyer said Conard's unflappable temperament helped. ''She's a good loser when she messes up and when she wins, she doesn't celebrate,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Richard Spooner of Fountain Valley, Calif., one of three men among the finalists, was reserve champion.</p>
        <p>Conard's chances of success here increased dramatically when she was teamed with Night Moves, a 7-year-old gelding purchased last year by Bertram and Diana Firestone. The owners, who hadn't often ridden in the last 20 years, used Night Moves as a refresher mount on the amateur circuit. The horse was stabled with Schlusemeyer, who for six years was Conard's trainer at Quiet Hill Farm in Ocala, Fla. He was loaned to Conard a year ago.</p>
