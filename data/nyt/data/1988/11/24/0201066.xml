        <p>LEAD: To the Editor:</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>On Nov. 13, 1903, a jealous suitor waited in ambush for his rival - a white-haired, white-bearded octogenarian - and shot the wrong man. In this spectacular fashion was ended the spectacular life of Andrew Haswell Green, a life that from a historical perspective was the most influential in the progress of New York.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Green is still known to some as the ''Father of Greater New York'' because of his almost singlehanded, 30-year odyssey in creating the present consolidated city from the many surrounding communities at the end of the last century. But there is little knowledge of his role in the creation and operation of Central Park, in bringing down Boss Tweed, in shaping the public school system, in organizing such basic institutions as the Public Library, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Natural History and as an early and important conservationist.</p>
        <p>Descriptions of Green's activities are not derived from exaggerations by latter-day biographers. Independent sources and Green's numerous and cogent ''memorials'' to legislative bodies tell an amazing story. Only brief excerpts can be presented here. The American Science and Historic Preservation Society noted the 10th anniversary of the death of its founder, Andrew H. Green, in its 735-page annual report for 1913: ''The debt which New York City owes to Mr. Green's memory is immeasurable.''</p>
        <p>''As commissioner, president and comptroller of Central Park during its formative years, he was the master-builder of that great institution, which is a daily blessing to the adults and children of the city. As Comptroller of the city's finances, he rescued the municipal credit from disaster and saved millions of dollars to the city treasury.''</p>
        <p>A typical example of his reduction of annual expenditures over five years (1871-76): For stationery and printing from $1,018,958 to $157,741; for advertising from $1,093,369 to $48,510.</p>
        <p>''To the state at large he rendered many notable services, conspicuous among which were his 20 years' service as member and president of the commissioners of the state reservation at Niagara Falls, and his pioneer efforts which contributed largely to the saving of the Palisades of the Hudson.''</p>
        <p>Thus, major governmental reforms and meaningful economic and social advances were made toward the end of the last century, despite governmental misdirection and political mischief that differed from the present only in style. Green and others were able to overcome political intransigence. What is lacking now?</p>
        <p>Would Green have permitted bureaucratic trashing of education quality? Would Green have accepted 40 years of political 5-cent subway fare and the resultant degrading of the transit system? Would Green have allowed the political wasting of the city's housing?</p>
        <p>Where are you, Andrew Haswell Green?  SEYMOUR DURST  New York, Nov. 13, 1988</p>
