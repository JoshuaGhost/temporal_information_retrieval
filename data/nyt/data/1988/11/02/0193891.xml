        <p>LEAD: The Government today barred South Africa's most prominent opposition newspaper, The Weekly Mail, from publishing for the next month.</p>

        <p>LEAD: The Government today barred South Africa's most prominent opposition newspaper, The Weekly Mail, from publishing for the next month.</p>
        <p>The Government today barred South Africa's most prominent opposition newspaper, The Weekly Mail, from publishing for the next month.</p>
        <p>The order was signed by the Home Affairs Minister, J. Christoffel Botha, who acted under the censorship laws of the country's state of emergency, which has been in effect for 28 months.</p>
        <p>The announcement was published today in The Government Gazette. It said, ''The production or publishing during this period from the date of publishing this order up to and including 28 November 1988, of all further issues of the periodical The Weekly Mail is hereby totally prohibited.''</p>
        <p>Though the ban technically lasts four weeks, Anton Harber, The Weekly Mail's co-editor, said the next issue would not appear until Dec. 2, since Friday is the normal publication day. A Lively Tabloid</p>
        <p>''One thing you can be certain of is we'll be back on Dec. 2,'' Mr. Harber said as he sat on a desk of the newspaper's spartan newsroom. ''We'll be back with a newspaper as strong and determined and forthright as ever.''</p>
        <p>The Weekly Mail, a lively tabloid-sized newspaper, has attracted a readership among affluent white South Africans as well as those more active in the anti-apartheid movement because of its trenchant reporting and an irreverent style that eschews dogmatism. Many of its staff members came from The Rand Daily Mail, an anti-apartheid daily that closed in 1984.</p>
        <p>This is the first time The Weekly Mail has been stopped from publishing, though two issues were seized by the police. The Government threatened to suspend publication last April but backed off after international protests.</p>
        <p>Two weeklies in the alternative press, New Nation in Johannesburg and South in Capetown, were suspended but have resumed publication.</p>
        <p>Mr. Botha was not required under media censorship laws to justify his decision. Irwin Manoim, the newspaper's other co-editor, said Mr. Botha sent a letter accusing The Weekly Mail of enhancing the image of unlawful organizations like the African National Congress and denigrating the image of South African security forces by publishing allegations of atrocities committed along the Angolan border.</p>
        <p>Mr. Botha warned the newspaper of pending action two weeks ago and rejected a request Oct. 26 from the editors and their lawyers for a meeting.</p>
        <p>The monthlong ban on publication was less severe than might have been imposed. The Government has the authority to stop a publication for up to three months and to install an official censor in its newsroom.</p>
        <p>David Dison, a Johannesburg lawyer who represented The Weekly Mail, saw the one-month ban as a victory of sorts for the newspaper because it showed that Mr. Botha was worried about the outcry a harsher penalty would create. To Continue Salaries</p>
        <p>Still, the banning was bound to hurt The Weekly Mail financially. It operates on a meager budget and depends on sympathetic advertisers to support a circulation of about 25,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manoim said November was important for pre-holiday advertising, ''so we've actually lost out on a potential month.'' But he called the Government's timing ''entirely accidental.''</p>
        <p>Another problem, the co-editors said, was to hold the newspaper's staff together during the banning. They will continue to pay salaries.</p>
        <p>The mood this evening in The Weekly Mail's newsroom, on the fifth floor of a small building in a shabby Johannesburg side street, was sober but not defeated as the editors fielded telephone calls and honed their reaction.</p>
        <p>Their statement began: ''The Minister of Home Affairs has made abundantly clear how arbitrary his rule is: why has he acted against us this week and not last or next; why for one month and not two or three? The reality is that Minister needs to supply no reason and need follow no logic - he simply decides, alone and without consulation, one man acting as prosecutor, judge and executioner.''</p>
        <p>The Weekly Mail drew support today from other quarters. Harvey Tyson, the editor in chief of The Johannesburg Star, South Africa's largest circulation daily, said:</p>
        <p>''The closure of The Weekly Mail is sad because it is another blatantly unjust attack not only on one paper, but on all individual rights. It is silly because it is so unnecessary - and so nationally damaging - to try to kill a responsible, informative, nonrevolutionary newspaper.''</p>
