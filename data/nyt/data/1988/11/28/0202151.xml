        <p>LEAD: Arson is suspected in a fire Saturday that killed a woman, two of her sons and a young man who was visiting them in an apartment house here.</p>
        <p>Arson is suspected in a fire Saturday that killed a woman, two of her sons and a young man who was visiting them in an apartment house here.</p>
        <p>Another visitor was reported in critical condition, and six other people in the building escaped unharmed.</p>
        <p>The dead were Carol Ann Kugel, 41 years old, her sons, Don Smith, 22, and Wayne Kugel, 10, and James Jackson, 21, all victims of smoke inhalation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jackson and his twin brother, Joseph, were visiting. Joseph Jackson was in critical condition at the Hennepin County Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Police and fire officials are investigating the fire as a possible multiple homicide, said Police Sgt. Michael LaVine. He declined to provide details of why arson was suspected.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kugel's neighbors said she had three other children who were not home during the fire. ''They were a very good family and they never caused no trouble,'' said Janet Erickson, who said Mrs. Kugel was ''like a sister.''</p>
