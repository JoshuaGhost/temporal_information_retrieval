        <p>A Federal judge today temporarily blocked the $2.5 billion acquisition of Lucky Stores Inc. by the American Stores Company and scheduled further hearings on a preliminary injunction.</p>
        <p>''The proposed acquisition threatens serious irreversible harm to the public interest within California, which outweighs any harm to defendants if the mergers are temporarily restrained,'' Federal District Judge David V. Kenyon said in issuing a restraining order. Judge Kenyon prohibited</p>
        <p>American Stores, the Salt Lake City-based parent company of the Alpha-Beta supermarket chain, from beginning an operation with Lucky Stores, based in Dublin, Calif., until the matter is resolved. A hearing has been set for</p>
        <p>Sept. 16. The merger has been tentatively approved by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
        <p>The California Attorney General, John Van de Kamp, had sought the court order on the ground that the acquisition of Lucky Stores by American Stores would lessen supermarket competition.</p>
