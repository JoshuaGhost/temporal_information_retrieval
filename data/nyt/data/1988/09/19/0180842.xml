        <p>LEAD: Bulletin from the Bush campaign! The contest is escalating. Not the Presidential contest - the other one, the tie contest.</p>
        <p>Bulletin from the Bush campaign! The contest is escalating. Not the Presidential contest - the other one, the tie contest.</p>
        <p>''Deadly serious,'' said one senior Bush aide. ''I kid you not.''</p>
        <p>Every morning at 8 A.M., the senior staff gather in the offices of James A. Baker 3d, the campaign chairman, to discuss strategy. Within recent weeks, Mr. Baker, the former Treasury Secretary, casually began a contest to see which of the men participating would wear ''the most outrageous tie,'' said one campaign aide.</p>
        <p>As Republicans and conservatives, the ''outrageous'' initially meant mildly colorful material - the kind of ties usually worn by dads overseeing those ''coming-out'' parties the Vice President fondly talks about. (After losing an Iowa straw poll, Mr. Bush said his supporters had been ''at their daughters' coming out parties or teeing up at the golf course for that all-important last round.'') At the conclusion of each meeting, Mr. Baker judges which is the most outrageous tie - and he has, quite often, decided that he was wearing it, and no one argues since he's the boss. Now others have joined in with gusto, tossing their Brooks Brothers cravats to the wind.</p>
        <p>''Baker has been wearing light greens and bright yellows - big power stuff,'' said one persistent loser who sits in on the meeting.</p>
        <p>Others are challenging the boss though, including Joseph Canzeri, the senior adviser to Mr. Bush's running mate, Dan Quayle, and a Washington public relations man who has never favored modest ties. Mr. Canzeri is rapidly emerging as Mr. Baker's rival.</p>
        <p>Even Margaret Tutwiler, a Baker aide, has begun wearing blazing, brilliant scarfs and has been welcomed into the arena. Other women on the staff are joining. The competition is growing intense.</p>
        <p>''People are picking out pastels, people are picking out polka dots, loud colors, brilliant designs,'' said the Bush campaign source.</p>
        <p>Yes, yes, the campaign source said with glee, the preppie days are over.</p>
