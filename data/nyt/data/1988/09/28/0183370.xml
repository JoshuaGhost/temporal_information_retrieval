        <p>LEAD: At the White House Sub Shop - ''World Famous Since 1946,'' according to the sign out front - Pete Dawkins moved from booth to booth, televison cameras in tow, introducing himself to the diners.</p>
        <p>At the White House Sub Shop - ''World Famous Since 1946,'' according to the sign out front - Pete Dawkins moved from booth to booth, televison cameras in tow, introducing himself to the diners.</p>
        <p>Yvette Richardson, an auditor at a nearby casino, confessed that she had not heard of the Republican candidate for United States Senator before she put down her big hoagie to grasp his almost equally big hand. ''But now I've met him,'' she said. ''So I'll vote for him.''</p>
        <p>With only six weeks left until Election Day, Mr. Dawkins and his wife, Judi, are conducting an energetic road campaign, spending 14-hour days shaking enough hands to give Arnold Schwarzenegger a charley horse, making enough speeches to give Phil Donahue laryngitis.</p>
        <p>To win this race, Mr. Dawkins needs to expand rapidly the number of New Jersey voters who know and like him. At the same time, he believes, he must arouse as many doubts as possible about the abilities and political priorities of his Democratic opponent, Frank R. Lautenberg, the incumbent Senator. An Encouraging Reception</p>
        <p>The visit to the White House, a local landmark close to Atlantic City's kitschy gambling palaces but nearer still to the town's crumbling slums, was the last stop on a hectic swing through southern New Jersey, a predominantly Republican swath of the state where audiences gave Mr. Dawkins an encouraging reception.</p>
        <p>Expected to be more difficult for him are the towns to the north, habitat of many Democrats and that vital yet elusive species, the New Jersey swing voter.</p>
        <p>''It's important to get as much bounce as we can down here,'' Mr. Dawkins said in a conversation after a speech at a Republicans' meeting in Mount Laurel. ''People need to be enthusiastic so they get out and vote, not sit home on election night. But I can't afford to spend too much time down here.''</p>
        <p>Political analysts estimate that no more than 6 out of 10 Jerseyans now know who Pete Dawkins is and that he wants to be their Senator. They may know, too, that he is 50 years old, a Heisman Trophy winner, a Rhodes scholar and a retired Army brigadier general who became a millionaire on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Beyond that, ''we don't know much about the guy yet,'' said Takashi Moriuchi, a peach and apple farmer who came to hear him speak at a Rotary luncheon in Moorestown, a leafy and graceful 300-year-old community of 17,000 not far from Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dawkins glided smoothly around the room, introducing himself and making small talk: ''Can I say hello?'' ''Are you from this town or just in for the day?'' ''Thanks for stopping by.'' He joined in a chorus of ''America'' and bowed his head for grace before the chicken was served.</p>
        <p>A little later, as waiters distributed chocolate pudding, he began his talk with local touches, such as a compliment on the town's anti-drug program and a joking reference to a onetime resident of Moorestown, Samuel Allen, said to be the inventor of the Flexible-Flyer (''I used to have one'') and a manure spreader (''it may be useful in my present incarnation''). 'A Small Record'</p>
        <p>Then he went into what has become his standard speech, including strafes of derision aimed at his 64-year-old rival. Mr. Lautenberg, he said, ''does absolutely define the left wing of the Democratic Party'' and ''makes Teddy Kennedy look like a centrist.''</p>
        <p>He belittled Mr. Lautenberg's earlier career in business, saying that if making a large company out of a small one qualifies a person for high office, ''Frank Perdue should be President of the United States.''</p>
        <p>The Senator's record in Congress, he said, ''is a small record, a 45.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dawkins asserted that his opponent has been ineffective as a champion of New Jersey's environmental interests - ''The ocean has gotten dirtier'' - and that he has not delivered for its economy. In 1982, Mr. Dawkins said, New Jersey ranked 45th among the states in return on Federal tax dollars. ''But Mr. Lautenberg changed that,'' Mr. Dawkins said. ''We're now 50th out of 50.'' 'Slinging Mud'</p>
        <p>Next, Mr. Dawkins sharply criticized Mr. Lautenberg's strategy of running a negative campaign, ''slinging mud instead of debating issues.''</p>
        <p>But a muddy campaign, Mr. Dawkins's advisers concede, may be better than a dull one, more likely to attract news coverage - ''free media'' - in a state in which television commercials are staggeringly expensive and at a time when the public's attention is distracted by the Presidential campaign, the Olympics and the final games of the baseball season.</p>
        <p>''We want to smoke Lautenberg out,'' said Paul Kenyon, the Dawkins press secretary. ''We want to get him to fight with us so we can show that he's a liberal, that he's got a temper and that he's not all that articulate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dawkins's advisers have also been working to improve his style, in particular to get him to drop what his critics view as hyperbole and saccharine sentimentality, traits that Mr. Lautenberg has tried to ridicule in television advertisements ending with the tag line, ''Be Real, Pete.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, Mr. Dawkins did seem more natural and comfortable on the stump than he was a few weeks ago, though occasionally he lapsed into political truisms, as when he told the Rotarians that ''this election is about our future.'' A Retirement Village</p>
        <p>Later that afternoon, in an auditorium at a retirement village in Medford, Mr. Dawkins provoked some puzzled stares when he told a story about his father who, he said, dreamed from his earliest childhood of being a dentist. ''He used to take the paraffin from the tops of jars and use that with kernels of corn to make false teeth,'' Mr. Dawkins said.</p>
        <p>The high point of the day was a party for Mr. and Mrs. Dawkins given by a Republican State Senator, C. William Haines, who boasts of being the only farmer in the New Jersey Legislature. Around the swimming pool at his well-appointed Mount Laurel home - built by his ancestors in 1769 - Mr. Haines served a 160-pound roast pig with an apple clenched in its jaws, fresh Jersey corn-on-the-cob and other fixings.</p>
        <p>Although the event was not scheduled as a fund-raiser, quite a few checks were written. ''I just feel as though the guy's got it,'' said one contributor, Barney Patterson of Haddonfield. ''He's all-American. He served his country. He represents what I represent.''</p>
