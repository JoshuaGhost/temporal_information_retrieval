        <p>LEAD: Americans are losing at least $1 billion a year in fraudulent telephone sales, the Federal Trade Commission told Congress today.</p>
        <p>Americans are losing at least $1 billion a year in fraudulent telephone sales, the Federal Trade Commission told Congress today.</p>
        <p>''We estimate that telemarketing scams may take as much as $1 billion a year out of the pockets of American consumers, ranging from widows looking for safe investments for insurance proceeds to business executives buying business equipment,'' a Federal Trade Commissioner, Terry Calvani, told the Senate Consumer subcommittee.</p>
        <p>He said the estimate might be low since total telephone sales in 1986 were $118.5 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calvani said diamonds, gold, silver, rare coins, oil leases, health products and vacation trips were among the many items involved in telephone fraud. In most cases, products sold by telephone either were never delivered or were not what was promised, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Calvani said it was difficult to prosecute fraudulent telemarketers because many operate for only a short time and then disappear, only to reappear somewhere else with a different scheme.</p>
        <p>He said the F.T.C. was increasing its efforts against telephone fraud and had formed a databank with 22 states to identify violators and spot trends and new frauds.</p>
