        <p>LEAD: The former editor of The Dallas Times Herald, C. David Burgin, has been named vice president and editor in chief of The Houston Post, the newspaper announced.</p>
        <p>The former editor of The Dallas Times Herald, C. David Burgin, has been named vice president and editor in chief of The Houston Post, the newspaper announced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burgin, 49 years old, succeeds Peter O'Sullivan, 39, who said he was resigning to pursue other opportunities, The Post reported Saturday. Burgin was editor of The Times Herald until June, when the paper was sold, and is a longtime associate of William Dean Singleton, whose Houston-based Media News Group Inc. owns The Post. Media News previously owned The Times Herald.</p>
        <p>The two men have known each other since 1977. ''His newspapers have warmth,'' Mr. Singleton said. ''They have personality.'' Mr. Singleton praised Mr. O'Sullivan for his accomplishments since taking over as editor in December 1983. ''The Post under Peter made dramatic improvements,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Earlier last week, The Post announced that the paper's publisher, Don Hunt, was moving to head a new international division of Media News. Mr. Hunt had stayed on at the newspaper after the Toronto Sun Publishing Company sold it to Mr. Singleton's company a year ago. Mr. Singleton replaced Mr. Hunt as publisher.</p>
        <p>Burgin said Ernie Williamson will remain as the paper's managing editor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burgin has also been editor of The Washington Star, The Peninsula Times Tribune in Palo Alto, Calif., The Orlando Sentinel and The San Francisco Examiner.</p>
        <p>Correction:  September 13, 1988, Tuesday, Late City Final EditionSeptember 14, 1988, Wednesday, Late City Final Edition</p>
        <p>An article by The Associated Press yesterday about the appointment of C. David Burgin as vice president and editor in chief of The Houston Post misstated his former position at The Washington Star. He was sports editor of The Star from 1973 to 1977.</p>
        <p>An article on Monday about the ap-pointment of C. David Burgin as editor of The Houston Post and a correction in this space yesterday misstated Mr. Burgin's previous positions at The Washington Star. He was sports editor of The Star from 1971 to 1973, metropolitan editor until 1975 and assistant managing editor for weekends from 1976 to 1977.</p>
