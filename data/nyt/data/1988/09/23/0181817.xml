        <p>LEAD: HOPING for a takeover battle, some Wall Street traders several months ago loaded up on shares of West Point-Pepperell, the big Georgia textile company. Now they are worried that Pepperell may not be a takeover target after all.</p>
        <p>HOPING for a takeover battle, some Wall Street traders several months ago loaded up on shares of West Point-Pepperell, the big Georgia textile company. Now they are worried that Pepperell may not be a takeover target after all.</p>
        <p>William Farley, head of a Chicago textile company named Farley Inc., touched off speculation last May when he requested Government antitrust clearance to buy more than 15 percent of Pepperell. The stock immediately jumped $4.375, to $35.75, steadily climbing to $41.25 by late June. It has drifted since, and by yesterday stood at $35.50, down 37.5 cents on the day.</p>
        <p>Wall Street's worry is that while Mr. Farley received Government approval to buy the stock three months ago, he has done almost nothing to show that he is still interested - although he may have a position in the stock. Particularly puzzling, according to traders, is that litigation in Federal and state courts in Georgia last summer suggested considerable Farley interest.</p>
        <p>Eight days after he notified Pepperell that he would seek approval to buy more than 15 percent, the litigation shows, Pepperell revamped its poison-pill defense to make a takeover more difficult. The original plan would have given stockholders the right to buy stock for half price if a hostile bidder bought 20 percent of the company. The new plan will touch off the pill if an unwelcome buyer bought as little as 10 percent. Mr. Farley argued through court papers that without Pepperell's approval it would be ''economically impossible'' for outsiders to buy even 10 percent of the company.</p>
        <p>When Pepperell asked the Superior Court of Troup County, Ga., to declare the pill to be enforceable under Georgia law, Mr. Farley asked a Federal court in Newnan, Ga., to take jurisdiction. Pepperell asked that the case be sent back to state court but in mid-July Federal Judge G. Ernest Tidwell refused. Since then no further court action on the validity of the pill has been taken, nothing has been filed and no hearings are scheduled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farley has $300 million left from a $500 million blind investment pool that Drexel Burnham Lambert raised for him last year, for the specific purpose of takeovers.</p>
        <p>No targets have been identified but using Wall Street estimates, Mr. Farley's $300 million would enable him to raise as much as $3 billion more to attack almost any company he liked. And if Pepperell is his main target, it would cost little more than $1 billion at present prices, although if he actually tried to buy it, he would have to offer far more.</p>
        <p>But Wall Street is so rumor-driven these days that whenever a textile or consumer stock advances a little more than usual, Mr. Farley's name comes up, on the chance that maybe he has lost interest in Pepperell. Among his targets, the rumors said, are VF, Interco, TW Services, Mead and Fort Howard. There may be more ahead on Pepperell but none of the others proved accurate.</p>
        <p>Speculation continues strong that Mr. Farley may yet have something in mind on Pepperell. In the last two weeks and apparently without foundation, traders concluded that by now Mr. Farley owned more than 5 percent of Pepperell stock and would either file disclosure papers or make an offer. To date neither has happened.</p>
        <p>''A lot of guys are betting that an offer is about to come,'' said one Wall Street analyst who has been following the situation. ''They could lose if nothing happens. Something could, of course, but the likelihood is that nothing will happen.''</p>
        <p>The possibilities seem limited: Pepperell could defend itself in some way but may not be able to buy back its own stock because it is already nearly $1 billion in debt after buying J.P. Stevens &amp; Company last May.</p>
        <p>A friendly suitor could emerge, with Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Company thought to be among the most likely. Kohlberg, Kravis has $5 billion in pension-fund money to invest and is eager to put it to work. But Kohlberg, Kravis typically does not make a move unless someone else moves first. And Mr. Farley is taking his time.  At the moment he is on business in the Far East, his office said, and will not be back until later this month.</p>
        <p>His standing at Pepperell is not very high. Joseph L. Lanier Jr, chairman of Pepperell, has repeatedly said that he wants the company to remain independent and ''does not welcome'' any big accumulation of Pepperell stock.</p>
