        <p>Thousands of motorists were trapped for hours today on an elevated southbound section of the New Jersey Turnpike after an asphalt truck overturned and dumped liquid tar on two lanes of the three-lane road.</p>
        <p>The accident occurred about 9 A.M. near and the Kearny-Secaucus border. The spilled liquid tar then caught fire, igniting a tar-fueled blaze that burned for several hours.</p>
        <p>Trooper Edward Lennon of the state police identified the truck driver as Brian Stofan of Richfield Park, N.J. He said that Mr. Stofan suffered head and leg injuries, but that he did not know how serious they were or to what hospital he had been taken.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, Jean Audbato, said the fire caused delays on the turnpike's eastern spur between exit 15E and well into Hudson County. All lanes were open again at 2:30 P.M.</p>
        <p>She said thousands of southbound motorists from the Lincoln Tunnel and George Washington Bridge were caught in the traffic jam.</p>
