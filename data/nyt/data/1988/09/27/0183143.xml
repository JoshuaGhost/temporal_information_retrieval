        <p>Michael O'Koren, the Nets' 1980 first-round draft choice, has joined the team's radio broadcast team and speakers' bureau. O'Koren, 30, who starred at North Carolina, played six seasons for the Nets before being traded to the Washington Bullets in October 1986. He was waived by the Bullets several months later. O'Koren signed as a free agent with the Boston Celtics last season and was re-acquired by the Nets toward the end of the season but never played for them. He was plagued by a pulled hamstring. The Nets also announced that Al Menendez, the director of player personnel for the past nine years, has resigned.</p>
