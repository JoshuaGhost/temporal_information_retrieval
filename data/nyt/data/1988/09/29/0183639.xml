        <p>The Pro Bowl guard Ron Solt ended a 10-week contract dispute yesterday by signing a five-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts yesterday. He then bitterly criticized Robert Irsay, the team owner.</p>
        <p>''The Colts were trying to ruin my career by making me hold out,'' Solt, a four-year veteran, said after signing the contract. Solt, a first-round draft pick in 1984, had started all 59 of his N.F.L. games with the Colts. The new contract is reportedly worth $2.6 million, a figure Solt did not dispute, but he said it was about $400,000 less than the amount he sought. He also wanted the Colts to pick up the costs of insuring him against football-related injuries. They refused. ''Essentially, they told me if I go out and break my neck, they're going to turn their back on me, which is what I'd expect from this team,'' said Solt. (AP)  SPORTS PEOPLE</p>
