        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''The President's Night in the Sun'' (editorial, Aug. 14), which summed up President Reagan's term in office on the eve of the Republican National Convention, presents a rosier picture of the economy than the Reagan Administration deserves. Since January 1981, 18 million new jobs have been created. Of these, three-quarters have been in the two lowest-paying sectors of our economy - retail trade and health and business services -while jobs in the higher-paying manufacturing sector have declined by 620,000.</p>
        <p>Even during the Administration of Jimmy Carter our economy fared better: manufacturing jobs increased by 1.3 million, and only 42 percent of new jobs were in the lowest-paying sectors. Similarly, part-time jobs have increased by 704,000 since President Reagan took office, compared with a decline of 319,000 under President Carter. The average annual job creation was higher during the Carter Administration than under the Reagan Administration.</p>
        <p>The 5.2 percent unemployment rate that you cite masks the true nature of unemployment in our economy: 24 million part-time workers who are counted as fully employed in determining the unemployment rate and 6 million more people who want jobs but don't fulfill the requirements set by the Labor Department to be counted as unemployed.</p>
        <p>The results of the Reagan record on jobs are reflected in the latest poverty data (for 1986). Thirty-two million Americans live in poverty. Three million of these worked year round, and nine million were employed during the year.</p>
        <p>The President may owe his night in the sun to victories in promoting the interests of the rich and the military - not to any achievements for this country's working poor and middle class. DAVID DEMBO  WARD MOREHOUSE  New York, Aug. 19, 1988</p>
        <p>The writers are, respectively, the program coordinator and president of the Council on International and Public Affairs.</p>
