        <p>The resignation of Gov. Jim Guy Tucker has set off a game of political musical chairs that will immediately give Republicans a larger foothold in the government of Arkansas, the only Southern state that has been slow to move toward Republicanism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tucker, a 53-year-old Democrat, announced his resignation yesterday after being convicted of one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud in the first Whitewater trial. His resignation, which he said would enable him to devote himself fully to preparing his appeals, is effective on July 15.</p>

        <p>The resignation of Gov. Jim Guy Tucker has set off a game of political musical chairs that will immediately give Republicans a larger foothold in the government of Arkansas, the only Southern state that has been slow to move toward Republicanism.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tucker, a 53-year-old Democrat, announced his resignation yesterday after being convicted of one count of conspiracy and one count of mail fraud in the first Whitewater trial. His resignation, which he said would enable him to devote himself fully to preparing his appeals, is effective on July 15.</p>
        <p>He will be succeeded by Mike Huckabee, now Lieutenant Governor, who will become only the third Republican Governor of the state in this century, after Winthrop Rockefeller and Frank White. Beyond the Democrats' longtime hold on the Statehouse, Arkansas has not had a Republican senator since Reconstruction, and  the Legislature too is heavily dominated by Democrats.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Huckabee chooses, he can fill the remainder of Mr. Tucker's term, which does not expire until January 1999. But he is already running for the Senate, bringing the prospect that the Governor's office may ultimately be occupied by someone, not yet identified, who wins a special election to fill out Mr. Huckabee's term as Lieutenant Governor.</p>
        <p>"It throws all the major offices up for grabs," said Merle Black, a political science professor at Emory University in Atlanta. "And it potentially throws the Senate race into confusion."</p>
        <p>Mr. Huckabee, a Baptist minister, has won the Republican nomination for the seat now held by Senator David Pryor, who is retiring. The Democratic nominee will be determined in a primary runoff between State Attorney General Winston Bryant and State Senator Lu Hardin.</p>
        <p>So Mr. Huckabee's newly acquired office will force him to face a tough question over the next several months: Should he abandon his Senate race and stay on as Governor, a position considered more vital in Arkansas politics than  Senator? Or should he continue to run for the Senate?</p>
        <p>"He's got nothing to lose," Mr. Black said. "If he loses the Senate race, then he remains as Governor. If he wins, he would have to vacate the governorship and become a Senator. This combination of factors is rare. It is unclear whether he would want to leave his Governor's seat."</p>
        <p>Diane Blair, a professor of political science at the University of Arkansas,  noted that the last time the state faced anything like the current situation was 1993, when Bill Clinton, having just been elected President, left the governorship and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor Tucker. Questions arose then about whether the office of lieutenant governor could go unfilled, because  it is a part-time position, or whether it was necessary to hold a special election. In the end, a special election was held, and was won by Mr. Huckabee.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blair, a friend of Hillary Clinton who is is married to another Clinton associate, James Blair, a lawyer, said there would be more opportunities for Republicans in light of Governor Tucker's resignation.</p>
        <p>"Arkansas has been Republicanizing much more slowly than any of the other Southern states," she said. "The immediate effect is that it will be far easier  for Republicans to run for the open seats that will be created by this chain of  events."</p>
