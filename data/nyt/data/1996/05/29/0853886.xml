        <p>The National Science Foundation has startled American computer firms by planning the Federal Government's first purchase of a Japanese supercomputer. But the foundation has also said it would follow up on allegations that the Japanese maker, NEC, was offering its supercomputer below cost, a violation of trade rules known as dumping. That is the right message. NEC gets a fair shot at the contract, but only a fair shot. Unfortunately, another arm of Government, the Commerce Department -- which decides when dumping occurs -- may already have stacked the case against NEC.</p>
        <p>The science foundation is paying most of the cost of a supercomputer that will be used by a university consortium for climate research. The consortium has decided that, for the calculations its research will require, the NEC supercomputer is better than that of its main American rival, Cray Research. The foundation needs to buy the best computer if American research is to remain pre-eminent. Assuming that NEC has obeyed trade laws, it is also important to let merit prevail. Otherwise, Japan and other trading partners are unlikely to give American exporters a fair shake.</p>

        <p>The National Science Foundation has startled American computer firms by planning the Federal Government's first purchase of a Japanese supercomputer. But the foundation has also said it would follow up on allegations that the Japanese maker, NEC, was offering its supercomputer below cost, a violation of trade rules known as dumping. That is the right message. NEC gets a fair shot at the contract, but only a fair shot. Unfortunately, another arm of Government, the Commerce Department -- which decides when dumping occurs -- may already have stacked the case against NEC.</p>
        <p>The science foundation is paying most of the cost of a supercomputer that will be used by a university consortium for climate research. The consortium has decided that, for the calculations its research will require, the NEC supercomputer is better than that of its main American rival, Cray Research. The foundation needs to buy the best computer if American research is to remain pre-eminent. Assuming that NEC has obeyed trade laws, it is also important to let merit prevail. Otherwise, Japan and other trading partners are unlikely to give American exporters a fair shake.</p>
        <p>That said, there are sound reasons to pursue the dumping allegations. Japanese firms have a record of gaining a market toehold by selling below cost.  The threat is that NEC will temporarily underprice its supercomputer and drive financially shaky firms like Cray out of business.</p>
        <p>But a fair investigation may not be forthcoming under Commerce's rules, which are heavily weighted against foreign suppliers. Firms that sell supercomputers spend huge amounts on research and development and other fixed costs. Commerce's rules would require foreign suppliers to charge a price high enough to cover most of these costs within a year. American firms charge a lower price that recaptures costs over many years. The rules need to be made consistent.</p>
        <p>The department has already warned the foundation, on the basis of a preliminary examination, that NEC appears to be dumping. But if Commerce uses rules that are virtually guaranteed to find NEC guilty, even if it sets prices just like its American rivals, it will damage university research and encourage  trading partners to treat American exporters in the same rude fashion.</p>
