        <p>Congressional Republicans, eager to turn defense policy into a major issue in the Presidential campaign, are preparing to present President Clinton with legislation that they will portray as a test of his commitment to national military readiness.</p>
        <p>The first test is to come in the next few weeks as the full House and Senate  debate legislation sponsored by Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, that will force the United States to spend billions of dollars on the deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003.</p>
        <p>The bill, which revives the national debate over the anti-missile technology popularly known as Star Wars, is expected to be passed by both the House and Senate, setting the stage for a veto by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Called the Defend America Act, the bill is sponsored in the House by Speaker  Newt Gingrich and is to come up for a vote in the full House this week, along with the $267 billion military authorization bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton may veto the authorization bill if it retains provisions requiring the Pentagon to spend $13 billion more than it requested. Votes in the Senate on the missile defense bill and its version of the authorization bill are expected shortly.</p>
        <p>Although polls suggest that American voters are far more concerned with the economy than with military policy, especially with the cold war a fading memory, Mr. Dole and other Republican leaders are eager to persuade voters that the Clinton Administration has been lax on preparedness and that a second Clinton term could leave Americans vulnerable to attack from missiles fired by countries like North Korea and Libya.</p>
        <p>In recent speeches on the campaign trail, Mr. Dole has argued that Mr. Clinton's lack of support for a missile defense system was proof of his weakness on issues of military and foreign policy.</p>
        <p>"The fact is that we can't destroy a single missile," Mr. Dole said in a speech last month. "That's not because America is lacking the technical know-how. It's because America is lacking the Presidential leadership to get it  done."</p>
        <p>In a speech last week, he called for the creation of a program in which the United States would work with Japan and South Korea on a missile defense effort  to protect all three countries. "Missile defense is essential to our allies' security," he said.</p>
        <p>Only Russia and China have nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that can reach the United States. Pentagon officials say it will be at least a decade before other, smaller nations develop missiles able to reach the continental United States, although they acknowledge that North Korea may be only a few years away  from deploying a ballistic missile that can hit parts of Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
        <p>Senator Dole has focused on the threat from North Korea, which he described last week as "armed to the teeth" and "determined to develop weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them."</p>
        <p>The Administration estimates the cost of the missile defense system, which would depend on laser-equipped satellites and ground-based rockets, at more than $20 billion.</p>
        <p>The Administration has proposed that instead of moving immediately to deploy  a missile defense system, the Pentagon should continue to study missile defense  technology for three more years and then decide on whether deployment is needed.</p>
        <p>Administration officials say their plan would allow a system to be built in time to deal with a potential threat from North Korea or other countries and allow the United State to choose the best possible system.</p>
        <p>"The Dole-Gingrich bill says we must choose a system now and begin deploying  it in three years, independent of how our threat assessment evolves," Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in a recent speech. "Our plan says, 'Let's develop the system, then assess the threat in three years, and make our deployment decision accordingly.' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry said the Dole bill would cripple the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and endanger other arms control agreements with Russia that call for the  dismantling of thousands of nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Administration officials say the Republicans should be far more concerned about the possibility of rogue nations or terrorist groups slipping weapons of mass destruction into the United States through less exotic means than a missile.</p>
        <p>"A terrorist with a little technical know-how and 20 pounds of smuggled plutonium could make a bomb powerful enough to destroy a city," said a Pentagon  official. "That's what we should be worried about."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton vetoed the entire military authorization bill last year when it mandated a missile defense system. He signed a later version of the bill that removed the provision. Republicans offered the missile plan in a separate bill this year, hoping to draw more attention to the issue.</p>
        <p>The controversy harkens back to the debate in the 1980's over the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars. The United States spent tens of billions of dollars on that research to develop a system that was never deployed to defend against incoming nuclear-armed missiles. But the research from that earlier effort could be incorporated in the missile defense system proposed in the new bill.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole has tried repeatedly to interject military issues into the Presidential campaign. In recent campaign appearances, he has called on President Clinton to expand the production line for B-2 bombers, insisting that  the planned fleet of 21 will not meet military needs.</p>
        <p>The Administration rejected the proposal, noting that senior officials of the Air Force say it does not need more of the bombers, which cost more than $500 million each. The bombers are built in California, where Mr. Clinton enjoys a big lead over Mr. Dole in polls of prospective voters.</p>
