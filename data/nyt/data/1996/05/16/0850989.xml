        <p>Indignant state lawmakers today watched a videotape in the Capitol here showing a mass murderer snorting cocaine, engaging in sex and bragging about living the good life at Stateville prison.</p>
        <p>The killer, the late Richard Speck, murderer of eight young nurses in Chicago in 1966, also displays $100 bills on the tape and says at one point, "If they only knew how much fun I was having in here, they would turn me loose."</p>
        <p>The tape of Mr. Speck, who died in prison in 1991, was made available to the State House Judicary-Criminal Law Committee and other lawmakers by the journalist Bill Kurtis, who has made a television documentary on prison conditions in Illinois.</p>
        <p>But the tape was only the latest embarrassment for prison officials in the state. Larry Hoover, a Chicago street gang leader, awaits Federal trial on charges of running a huge drug distribution network even as he was an inmate in  the state prisons. And some guards have recently been dismissed and charged with having sexual relations with inmates at Dwight Correctional Center, a women's prison.</p>
        <p>"Has a culture of complicity developed in our prisons?" asked State Representative Peter Roskam, a Republican from suburban Chicago and vice chairman of the committee. Mr. Roskam said there would be hearings on the subject.</p>
        <p>"This is the kind of thing that really shakes the public's confidence in the  criminal justice system," he said.</p>
        <p>Parts of the tape have been broadcast on local television stations in Chicago. Mr. Kurtis's documentary will be shown on the Arts and Entertainment cable channel on Saturday.</p>
        <p>At the screening today, Mr. Kurtis said he had got the tape from a lawyer, whose name he did not disclose. It is unclear where the film makers obtained the video equipment and when the tape was made. But besides Mr. Speck there are two  other men on the tape, both unidentified, and one says the year is 1988.</p>
        <p>Odie Washington, who took over as director of the state's prisons last year,  said his department was helping the state's Attorney General investigate the making of the tape.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Washington defended conditions in Stateville Correctional Center and  other Illinois prisons today as orderly. "In the prison setting, some employees  break the rules and can be corrupted, the same as in any system," he said. "They are the exceptions."</p>
        <p>Mr. Washington also said that more was expected of guards as prison populations swell. There are now some 38,000 inmates in Illinois prisons, in a system designed for 23,500.</p>
        <p>Michael Lane, director of the state prison system from 1981 to 1990, told The Chicago Sun-Times he knew nothing about the tape.</p>
        <p>After the screening, State Representative Al Salvi, a Republican from suburban Chicago who is running for the United States Senate, said the demeanor  of Mr. Speck and the others "leads us to the conclusion that they had the run of the place." On the tape, the men do not appear to be worried about being caught.</p>
        <p>Mr. Salvi spoke of rumors that have circulated for years about lax conditions in Illinois prisons. "I don't think any member of this committee is surprised by this," he said. "Some of these problems have been under our nose for years. And  we need to do something about it."</p>
        <p>On visits to prisons, Mr. Salvi said he had seen that inmates were allowed to use sheets as drapes to hide themselves from view. "Why in God's name do these prisoners have this kind of privacy?" he asked.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Washington, the prison director, said those curtains were now being removed from cells, after recent changes in regulations.</p>
        <p>At the Capitol, a large crowd packed the hearing room where the Speck tape was shown.</p>
        <p>On the tape, Mr. Speck for the first time acknowledges that he killed the eight nurses. For years, he had said only that he had "blacked out" on drugs and could remember nothing about the killings.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers cleared the room of minors before showing parts of the sexually graphic tape. But after watching just a few moments of the sexual portion of the tape, in which Mr. Speck performs oral sex on another man, one lawmaker called,  "That's enough of that!" and the screening was ended.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speck worked as a painter in the prison, a relatively highly regarded job because it gave him freedom to move around.</p>
        <p>Stateville, a maximum-security unit in Joliet, was used in the filming of the movie "Natural Born Killers" and has a reputation for being one of the toughest  prisons in the United States.</p>
