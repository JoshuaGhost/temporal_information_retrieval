        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki today threw his support behind a plan for a railway to  Kennedy International Airport, a project that the Port Authority proposed to him two weeks ago but that the Giuliani administration is resisting.</p>
        <p>The Governor's endorsement of the railway came in a speech in Manhattan in which he proposed a series of billion-dollar initiatives to expand mass transit  in the New York region.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said he was ordering transportation officials to draft a master plan for the region that would integrate several projects that have been on the  drawing boards for years, including one that would link the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal and another that would eliminate two-fare zones.</p>
        <p>Most of the ideas are not new and face major hurdles before they can be translated into concrete and steel. And it was clear that Mr. Pataki had given them his backing because arms of his administration were already trying to bring them about.</p>
        <p>But some transportation experts praised Mr. Pataki for speaking out about them nonetheless.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki urged the region's mass transit agencies to cooperate so that riders could eventually use a single ticket to travel from the end of Long Island to the airports in Queens to the foothills of the Catskills.</p>
        <p>"As New York approaches the 21st century, it is time to equip the greatest city in the world with the finest transportation network in the world," he told  the New York Building Congress, a group of contractors and labor organizations.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Pataki was applauded during his speech, his discussion of the $1.08 billion proposal for the railway to Kennedy received a cool response from  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and other city officials.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey wants to build the line from the airport to the Long Island Rail Road and subway stations in Jamaica, Queens.</p>
        <p>Riders would take the subway or the L.I.R.R. from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to Jamaica.</p>
        <p>The Mayor has criticized the proposal, saying that travelers carrying luggage would not want to switch trains in Jamaica.</p>
        <p>He has urged the Port Authority to re-examine whether it can pay for a rail line from Manhattan to the airports.</p>
        <p>"There isn't anyone that really thinks that's going to add very much to reducing either the time or the car congestion heading out to the airport," Mr.  Giuliani said today of the current plan.</p>
