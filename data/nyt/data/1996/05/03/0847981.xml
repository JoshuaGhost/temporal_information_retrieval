        <p>JAMES DANZIGER, the owner of the photographic gallery in SoHo that bears his  name, is getting his diploma from St. Paul's School, the prep school in Concord, N.H., 25 years after his class graduated.</p>
        <p>Actually, Mr. Danziger was expelled from St. Paul's School three months before his commencement.</p>
        <p>It was that last night of winter term, and three of us were celebrating, so at 2 A.M. we broke into the library for a party," he recalled Wednesday. "We went through a window, and the glass broke just as the master was outside walking his dog."</p>
        <p>Mr. Danziger was immediately recognized. "I had the longest hair in the school," he said. "I was kicked out as an example."</p>
        <p>He went on to Yale anyway, since he had already been admitted before his expulsion from St. Paul's. Since then he has been a law-abiding citizen, entering buildings only through doors, so when he received an invitation to his  class's 25th reunion, he decided to to write the school delineating his accomplishments. "I was hoping in this era of reconciliation you might find a way to reconcile my past," Mr. Danziger wrote.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, he got a letter from St. Paul's announcing that he would in fact  receive his diploma, either by mail or in person if he decides to attend his reunion. Now, Mr. Danziger said, "I'm looking forward to getting my graduation presents."</p>
