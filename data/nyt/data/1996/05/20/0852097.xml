        <p>His sin was venial, but the consequences were mortal. By his own hand last Thursday, the Navy's most senior officer put a .38-caliber bullet into his chest, ending his life. Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, Chief of Naval Operations, killed himself when faced with disclosure by a magazine article that he had claimed two Vietnam War decorations to which he was not entitled.</p>
        <p>The admiral had not masqueraded as a Medal of Honor and Silver Star winner. He had embellished a pair of minor achievement ribbons he had been awarded in the Vietnam conflict with small V's that signified that the awards were for combat action. As it turned out, Admiral Boorda was never authorized to wear the combat V's.</p>
        <p>The admiral knew that the degree of his offense was minor. But it was not the degree that drove him to suicide. Mistakenly or not, he had violated one of  the most sacred trusts of the armed forces: the integrity of military awards. The shame and dishonor were too much for him. Perhaps as exculpation he put a bullet through the very place where he wore the counterfeit awards.</p>
        <p>Civilians may find it ludicrous that a mature and accomplished man would allow such a minor impropriety to drive him to suicide. Even military professionals were shocked at his action. There is nothing in the unwritten code of American military honor that condones or justifies suicide. Resignation is the usual path for those who perceive that they have violated a trust.</p>
        <p>The demons that drove the admiral to kill himself will never be known. But he was aware that he claimed combat awards when he had never seen action in his long and exemplary career, one in which he rose from lowly seaman to the pinnacle of the Navy's hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Civilian professionals look to their names on corporate letterheads, the key  to the executive lavatory or an office with a window view as visible manifestations of status. For a soldier, sailor, airman or marine a decoration is the symbol of status within the military fraternity. It has ever been so in the military. Virgil in "Aeneid," in the first century B.C., extols the soldier  with "Let all be present and expect the palm, the price of victory".</p>
        <p>Within the armed forces the distinction between a combat veteran and one who  has not seen combat is significant. It is a gulf that exists until one bridges it in a test by fire. Once across, those on the near side tend to discount its importance. For those on the far side, there is a vague feeling of unfulfillment. As he reached senior rank, Admiral Boorda may have brooded over the realization that he never crossed the bridge.</p>
        <p>Military decorations testify to which side of that gulf the wearer stands. They are displayed over the heart as pieces of colored ribbon adorned with a variety of devices signifying bravery, battles, and multiple awards in peacetime or war. They are a visual testament to the wearer's military history, where he or she has been and what he or she has done. Awards have a strict hierarchy, the highest personal award worn at the top with others in descending order. One look at a row of ribbons will tell if a military man has been through the crucible of war.</p>
        <p>Often irreverently referred to as "fruit salad" within the brotherhood of arms, the panoply of ribbons on a service person's chest have a mystique. They are the sacramentals of the military profession. Viewed as a manifestation of bravery and performance in a profession of violence, they establish the bona fides of the wearer.</p>
        <p>When civilians first meet, they assess each other by dress, grooming, voice and other characteristics. When service people meet for the first time they immediately look at the ribbons each wears. In a way, it establishes a hierarchy of respect unrelated to rank. A colonel with minor ribbons will show informal deference to an officer of lesser rank cited for valor or with multiple battle ribbons.</p>
        <p>A junior enlisted man wearing the light blue starred ribbon designating the Medal of Honor, awarded for gallantry above and beyond the call of duty, is held in awe by even generals and admirals. They conjure up images of what it must have taken to win that coveted award and in the process wish they had one. Even  between nations the awards ritual is observed because military bravery transcends boundaries and enmities as the coin of the military professional's realm.</p>
        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte knew the value of a military decoration and remarked, "A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon." Mike Boorda knew  also the value of decorations and cherished them. But in the end he assigned all too much value to them.</p>
        <p>Because of an editing error, the article also misstated, by reversing them,  the difference in attitudes toward combat between military people who have experienced it and those who have not. Combat veterans often discount its importance, while military people who have not seen combat have a vague feeling  of unfulfillment about it.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 21, 1996, Tuesday</p>
        <p>An article yesterday about the suicide of Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the integrity of military awards among members of the armed forces misstated the date of Virgil's "Aeneid" in some copies. It was written in the first century B.C.</p>
