        <p>A Federal judge gave preliminary approval today to an amended $351 million settlement of a lawsuit over pricing by some of the nation's biggest pharmaceutical companies, but analysts said consumers were unlikely to see a major change in drug prices right away.</p>
        <p>Under the settlement, drug makers agreed to stop charging retail pharmacies higher prices for drugs than health maintenance organizations and similar groups, which get the same drugs at a discount.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that could mean that drug makers would start offering discounts to pharmacies as well. Or it could mean H.M.O.'s will lose their discounts. Or, more likely, it could mean a little of both, analysts said.</p>
        <p>"I think the manufacturers will try to keep this neutral by raising the price a little to managed care and lowering it a little to retail pharmacies," said Stephen Schondlemeyer, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Minnesota who monitors drug industry pricing practices.</p>
        <p>"For consumers, I'd say it's a neutral to good effect."</p>
        <p>Judge Charles Kocoras of the United States District Court for Northern Illinois in Chicago gave preliminary approval to the amended settlement of the huge antitrust lawsuit, which was brought two years ago by nearly 40,000 retail  pharmacies against several major drug manufacturers.</p>
        <p>An initial settlement in the case was rejected in April by Judge Kocoras, who said it did not address future pricing practices by the drug makers.</p>
        <p>The pharmacies, which represent 45 percent of the drug business, had contended that they were being unfairly charged more for wholesale drugs than H.M.O.'s and other managed- care customers, which account for 55 percent.</p>
        <p>In the settlement, 11 major drug makers agreed to pay the pharmacies $351.1 million. They also said they would not deny discounts to drug sellers solely because they were retailers.</p>
        <p>"I think it's going to result in a leveling out of discounts," James Keeney,  an analyst for Rodman &amp; Renshaw, said. "I don't think the retail public will notice much difference."</p>
        <p>As pharmacies have lost business to H.M.O.'s, they have seen their profit margins decline. So they may be tempted to pocket any new discounts they get as  profits, although competitive pressures will limit this, analysts said.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for one company involved in the settlement, the American Home Products Corporation, said the proposed deal would not result in a one-price policy. Prices would still differ among various purchasers, he said.</p>
        <p>The judge scheduled a hearing for June 11 to discuss the fairness of the proposed settlement.</p>
        <p>Other companies that have agreed to the settlement include Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glaxo Wellcome, Eli Lilly, Merck, Pfizer, Schering-Plough, Warner-Lambert, Zeneca Group, SmithKline Beecham and Knoll Pharmaceutical.</p>
        <p>Major companies that were defendants in the original lawsuit but have not agreed to the proposed settlement are Abbott Laboratories and Ciba-Geigy.</p>
