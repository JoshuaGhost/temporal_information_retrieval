        <p>Solo Improvisations In a Broad Range of Styles Cecil Taylor, pianist Knitting Factory</p>
        <p>Cecil Taylor opened a program of his music on Tuesday night with a solo improvisation. Unaccompanied piano solos are his strength: Mr. Taylor is one of the great improvisers in American music. But not all improvisations are equal, and this night he sounded discontinuous.</p>
        <p>But his extraordinary control over the instrument and his melodic resources  were clear. Mr. Taylor, who is playing through tomorrow, clipped his notes short. He spread the parts of a chord over the keyboard, letting some notes ring and others die, muffled. He varied the weight of his sound, snapping some notes  and letting the rest grow softly. And at least during the first 15 minutes of his improvisation, he was quoting, from blues and boogie-woogie to the impressionists. There was a great feeling of sensuality: Mr. Taylor is in love with the sound of his instrument.</p>
        <p>His solo improvisations are often episodic. He uses short bits of melodies or ideas, repeating them as a piece grows toward its inevitable and furious conclusion, the catharsis that often justifies his work. But in the first set the episodes sounded like strung-together mannerisms, and the conclusion never quite arrived. There were brilliant moments, melodic fragments of great beauty,  but the structure had no logic.</p>
        <p>The first set opened with a group of several saxophonists, a trumpeter, two bassists and a few other strings. Though the musicians were reading music at times, the music mostly sounded freely improvised. It changed dynamic level, but that was about all, and when Mr. Taylor came out to play, the gravity of his sound made the group's set insignificant.</p>
