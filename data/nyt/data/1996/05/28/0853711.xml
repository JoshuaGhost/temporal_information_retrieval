        <p>THE Australian lungfish, which can use its one lung to breathe air, is one of the planet's strangest and hardiest survivors. It is one of the last remnants of the Dipnoi, a group of fish that has swum the world's rivers for more than 400 million years, managing to hang on as countless contemporaries, including the dinosaurs, died out and other creatures, like Homo sapiens, took their first steps. But conservationists say this species, now restricted to a handful of rivers in northeastern Australia, is being threatened in one of its last strongholds.</p>
        <p>The problem, they say, is the Walla Weir, a water impoundment planned for the Burnett River in Queensland, Australia, which they say will destroy critical spawning habitat of the species. But Government scientists and Queensland's Department of Natural Resources say conservationists' fears are overblown. They  say their studies indicate that the Walla Weir poses no significant threat to Neoceratodus forsteri, as the fish is also known, a species already protected by law from fishing.</p>
        <p>While a controversy continues to brew over the fish, the species' scientific value is in little doubt. Neoceratodus has fascinated researchers ever since it  was discovered in 1870.</p>
        <p>First thought to be salamanders, these creatures able to breathe air were later recognized as fish. Some scientists say they are the aquatic descendants of the lineage of revolutionary fishes that first flopped onto land and gave rise to reptiles, birds, amphibians -- all the land-living vertebrates, including humans.</p>
        <p>"It's a real case of a living fossil," Dr. William Bemis, an evolutionary anatomist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, said of the species, which is indistinguishable from its rock-hardened predecessors. Its only living  relatives are the South American and African lungfish, both of which are considered much less primitive.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Wourms, a comparative physiologist at Clemson University in South Carolina, said of the Australian lungfish and the coelacanth, another fish little changed over the millenniums: "These are the two most important species of fish for biologists to study in terms of evolution. They cry out for study."</p>
        <p>The Walla Weir, a small damlike structure, was proposed to help regulate the  Burnett River's flow in a region that is often plagued by flood and drought. The weir is particularly crucial to the local sugar cane farms, which require abundant and regular supplies of water. It was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of this year, but that goal has been pushed back to the end of 1997.</p>
        <p>Faced with growing concern about the weir, Government scientists carried out  a four-month study of lungfish in the Burnett River, where the species was discovered. They found adult lungfish abundant and spawning freely.</p>
        <p>"If you looked at the normal criteria to decide if a species was threatened or endangered, you wouldn't say the lungfish was," said Dr. Peter Jackson, principal scientist in freshwater fisheries with the Department of Primary Industries, which conducted the study.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Anne Kemp at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, an authority on the Australian lungfish, said the question was not whether adults were abundant and breeding in the Burnett. That, she said, is an issue no one disputes. The real issue is how eggs and young lungfish, which keep such populations going, will fare once the weir is built.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kemp, who has studied the species for 20 years, says the fish require waterside vegetation both for spawning and for the survival of juveniles, vegetation that she says cannot survive the fluctuating water levels in weirs.</p>
        <p>Enoggera Reservoir, where lungfish have been transplanted, Dr. Kemp said, illustrates the problem particularly well.</p>
        <p>As elsewhere, eggs are laid in the spring in vegetation near the water's edge. When the young lungfish hatch, she said, they hide out in the plants from  enemies like carnivorous fish, until they are large enough to venture about more safely. Lungfish at Enoggera did well breeding when there was water hyacinth, but since the plants were cleared, Dr. Kemp says no young have survived. Every lungfish caught in the reservoir recently has been very old.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kemp said the proposed weir is particularly worrisome as the lungfish's other two strongholds, the Mary and Brisbane Rivers, have little unaltered habitat remaining. She says in the water impoundments along these rivers in which the vegetation has been destroyed, though adults can easily be found, it is likely that few or no young are surviving to replenish the populations.</p>
        <p>"The Department of Primary Industries has openly admitted that the new weir will destroy a further 13 percent of the natural environment of the river," Dr.  Kemp said. "It might not sound like much but it's a major blow in that habitat.  It's a very big threat."</p>
        <p>But Dr. Jackson says 13 percent is a worst case scenario and the damage could easily be less than that. The biggest problem, he said, is that it is very difficult to say much definitively about these fish because so little is known about how they function in the wild. There still has been no good study estimating the lungfish population.</p>
        <p>Assessing the status of populations in or out of weirs is difficult. Adult lungfish are very long-lived and young lungfish are difficult to catch. So where young lungfish are doing poorly and where they are doing well, researchers are likely to see the same thing. In either case researchers are likely to find healthy numbers of surviving adults and few or no young, making it difficult to  tell when a population is heading into trouble.</p>
        <p>He did agree, however, that managing waterside vegetation was probably the key to maintaining any lungfish population.</p>
        <p>"The work we did suggests they do need vegetation and they need it present in relatively shallow water," he said. But, he went on, the question is: "Can you provide those conditions for vegetation to survive in that depth of water in an  impoundment? Can you regulate water sufficiently?" That, he suggested, is a matter, not for fish biologists like himself and Dr. Kemp, but for aquatic vegetation specialists to settle.</p>
        <p>But even if biologists can come up with ways to maintain the vegetation, the  question remains whether or not the use of the weir would allow such plans to be put properly into place.</p>
        <p>Ian Pullar, manager of resource development planning in Queensland's Department of Natural Resources, said that managing the weir to the benefit of the aquatic vegetation and the lungfish was "certainly not out of the question."</p>
        <p>Dr. Jackson said the report on the four-month study did recommend the development of a management plan for the species, but he said he knew of no such plan under way.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kemp said she had also seen no sign of a management plan. She said she feared that if Walla Weir went through, even more weirs would be built.</p>
        <p>Walla Weir appears to be only one of many possible problems for this species, whose river habitat has been continually altered. Fertilizer runoff and illegal  collection of the species for food and the black-market aquarium trade are also  concerns, Dr. Kemp said.</p>
        <p>Wide Bay Burnett Conservation Council Inc., a local group that is actively protesting the weir, is also working to nominate the Australian lungfish for full protection under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, said a spokeswoman, Pam Soper.</p>
        <p>"No matter which way you go with Walla Weir," said Dr. Jackson, "whichever side wins, we still don't know enough about the lungfish." And he warned, "Unless we take the time to get the necessary information, it could end up in a  serious state."</p>
