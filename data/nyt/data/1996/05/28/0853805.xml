        <p>Her name was Megan. Most people do not know his name.</p>
        <p>He confessed to strangling and raping her in 1994, the police say. She had just finished first grade. He lived across the street. His is the story of what the country fears.</p>
        <p>He had pleaded guilty twice before to sexually assaulting small children. In 1981, a judge had labeled him a "compulsive, repetitive sexual offender." Then,  after he had served more than seven years for his two crimes, he and two other convicted child molesters quietly moved here, into a neighborhood of split-level homes where people tend their gardens and their children well. Not long afterward, Megan Kanka was killed.</p>
        <p>Megan's death has become part of the national psyche. A dozen states have passed laws named for her requiring that communities be notified when sex offenders move in. President Clinton signed a national "Megan's Law" on May 17.</p>
        <p>The courts and the public have begun a long debate about whether such laws will work and are constitutional. This spring, the Random House Webster's College Dictionary added "Megan's Law" as a new term in the language.</p>
        <p>His name is Jesse K. Timmendequas. He turned 35 last month. He is a slight man with the same dirty blond hair and the same nervous preoccupation with himself that people who knew him as a teen-ager in Piscataway remember.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timmendequas (pronounced tim-MEN-duh-qwas) is in jail in Mercer County, N.J., awaiting trial for the killing. Prosecutors will seek the death penalty. He pleaded not guilty. He did not respond to a request for an interview, and his lawyer declined to answer questions for this article.</p>
        <p>But public records across New Jersey and interviews with people who knew him  and with psychologists, detectives, lawyers, a judge and other professionals who dealt with him fill out a picture as never before. It is a picture of the type of sex offender who defies efforts at rehabilitation, one who, because of Megan's death, has become a catalyst for a national change in the laws.</p>
        <p>At a restaurant off the Garden State Parkway one recent afternoon, one of his victims described the bitter memories he left behind. She is a bubbly 22-year-old college student. It has been 15 years since Mr. Timmendequas attacked her.</p>
        <p>She described the turmoil she felt when she heard who was accused of killing  Megan Kanka.</p>
        <p>"I wanted to kill him myself," said the young woman, who spoke on the condition that her name not be used. "They didn't stop him the first time."</p>
        <p>She was attacked in 1981 after Mr. Timmendequas lured her into the woods with the promise of firecrackers. Yellowed police records include Mr. Timmendequas's  admission that he ran away afterward, thinking he had choked her to death. "After she turned blue, I became scared," he said, according to a police transcript. "I dropped her and I thought she was dead."</p>
        <p>The young woman was attacked when she was 7, the same age as Megan Kanka when she was strangled with a leather belt 13 years later. Both girls bit down on their tongues as they struggled for breath.</p>
        <p>The stranger in the neighborhood had appeared pleasant, if ineffectual, over  the years to people who did not know about his secret thoughts. He helped an elderly man next door move furniture. "He was one of those quiet kids," remembered Mark Ciardi, a classmate in the Piscataway High School class of 1979.</p>
        <p>Cases against him stemming from assaults in 1979 and 1981 were routine in the legal system. He benefited from plea bargains in both cases. Because children often make poor witnesses, prosecutors can be reluctant to take molestation cases to trial.</p>
        <p>There is no evidence that he benefited from treatment offered him through the years. At one point, he failed to go to counseling even though a judge had ordered him into therapy as the only way to avoid jail. Some who knew what little he would reveal about his thoughts believed there was a danger he would attack children again.</p>
        <p>"I didn't think he would kill someone," said Rashmi Skadegaard, who was director of psychology at the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center in Avenel, N.J., where Mr. Timmendequas served six years. "But I certainly thought somebody was going to be his victim."</p>
        <p>State law-enforcement officials have repeatedly said that, without a notification rule, the state has no role after any sex offender like Mr. Timmendequas completes a sentence.</p>
        <p>The First Attack</p>
        <p>Two Little Girls, And a Stranger</p>
        <p>If anyone had been watching at about 4:30 on a fall afternoon in Piscataway in 1979, nothing would have seemed unusual. Two kindergarten girls were playing  a few doors down from the modest but neatly kept suburban house where one of them lived. Jesse Timmendequas, 18, rode by on his bicycle.</p>
        <p>He later told the police he was heading toward the apartment he shared with his mother, Doris Gorman, and her four other children in a rundown building three blocks away, on William Street in the New Market Pond area. Across William Street from where the girls were playing, a wooded embankment led to a stream.</p>
        <p>To the extent that people remember Mr. Timmendequas at all from those days, it is as someone who seemed not to fit in. "Jesse was just there," said a Piscataway school administrator who would only speak with a promise of anonymity. "He occupied a space. Nobody even really knew him."</p>
        <p>A few days after Mr. Timmendequas' 1979 arrest, a Piscataway detective, Richard Hand, wrote in a police report, misspelling the suspect's first name: "Jessie to my knowledge is known to hang around with boys much younger than himself, ages 10, 12 and 13 years of age. He has had several problems with the younger boys over in the pond area, New Market Pond, where he has had fights with them and throwing a few of them into the pond."</p>
        <p>According to one person who has seen psychological reports prepared after that arrest, Mr. Timmendequas said then that he remembered as traumatic an incident when he was 8: A group of older girls took his clothes away and forced  him to walk home through the streets.</p>
        <p>That Monday afternoon in October 1979, after he rode up William Street on his bicycle, he persuaded the two 5-year-old girls to go off with him in search of ducks. Mr. Timmendequas, according to the police report, took them by the hand and led them toward the embankment.</p>
        <p>At the bottom -- the police report does not say why -- one of the girls broke away and ran for help, leaving him with the other kindergartner.</p>
        <p>"When we got down to the bottom of the hill by the brook, I knocked her down  and then pulled her pants down," Mr. Timmendequas said in a statement he gave after the police confronted him the next day.</p>
        <p>He told the police he just wanted to look at her vagina. But the little girl  said he had smelled her. Then, she said, "I started to cry and he put his hand over my mouth."</p>
        <p>By then, a neighbor who had been alerted by the other 5-year-old was on her way across William Street. Mr. Timmendequas and the little girl ran back up the  hill. "She started to cry," his statement said, "and I ran back up the hill and  got my bike and took off towards home."</p>
        <p>Later that fall, Mr. Timmendequas pleaded guilty to attempted aggravated sexual assault. Judge John E. Bachman of State Superior Court in Middlesex County concluded that, "While he certainly has mental or psychiatric problems, these seem to be of the type which can be dealt with best in an outpatient setting," and gave Mr. Timmendequas a suspended sentence on the condition that he go for counseling.</p>
        <p>Court records show that he did not live up to those terms. Cited for violating the terms of his sentence, he served nine months in the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Center.</p>
        <p>The Second Attack</p>
        <p>Out of Jail, Back on the Prowl</p>
        <p>By the end of June in 1981, he was out of jail. He had an apartment in Dunellen, not far from Piscataway.</p>
        <p>About a quarter-mile from his apartment, there was a patch of woods. At the far edge of the woods was Middlesex Borough's public pool and tennis courts. Even now, neighbors let their children play alone there because it seems safe.</p>
        <p>That was where two 7-year-old girls, best friends, were playing the day Jesse Timmendequas came up to them. He asked if they wanted firecrackers for the Fourth of July. Mr. Timmendequas would later tell police he had waited in the area about an hour before he saw the girls, according to a transcript of his statement.</p>
        <p>One of the girls panicked, got on a bicycle and went screaming off in search  of their mothers. In his statement, Mr. Timmendequas described what happened next with the other child.</p>
        <p>"We walked down the trail a little bit and I grabbed her around the throat,"  he said, "and pulled her off to the side of the woods and when she started to turn blue I let her go and ran and that's it."</p>
        <p>An officer asked if he had been aroused. "Yes. A little bit," the transcript  quotes him saying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timmendequas, who had just turned 20, said he had been sexually interested in little girls for about a year. An officer asked if he knew what had caused that. "No," was all he answered.</p>
        <p>The girl's mother found her unconscious in the woods. The police were called. When Mr. Timmendequas walked out of the woods on the Dunellen side, a police car was waiting. A small stream separated that area from the scene of the assault. Mr. Timmendequas' blue jeans were wet from the knee down.</p>
        <p>In the hospital, the doctors concluded no sexual contact had occurred. The girl's father, who sat next to her during the recent interview, said he and his  wife have never been able to wipe away the image of their daughter with blue marks on her neck where she had been choked. On her stomach was a black and blue handprint where her attacker had gripped her.</p>
        <p>When Megan Kanka was killed all those years later, the father said, he felt he knew what his family had been spared. "As the years go by," he said, "you store it in the back of your mind. When this happened all I could think of was, 'That could have been my daughter.' "</p>
        <p>In a Program</p>
        <p>Sitting Silently Through Therapy</p>
        <p>For the incident in Middlesex, Mr. Timmendequas was charged with five felonies including kidnapping and attempted murder. But as is often true in such cases, the charges were difficult to prove. The prosecutor, Joyce Munkacsi, said in an interview that the little girl remembered nothing that would establish the sexual aspects of the case. And the girl's parents hoped to avoid a trial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timmendequas "seemed to want some type of assistance," said Ms. Munkacsi, now a judge in Middlesex County.</p>
        <p>They bargained. Mr. Timmendequas would plead guilty to attempted sexual contact and attempting to cause serious bodily injury and would be sent to New Jersey's center for sexual offenders at Avenel.</p>
        <p>The other charges were dropped. The maximum prison term was 10 years and the  judge in the case, C. Judson Hamlin, imposed it, finding that Mr. Timmendequas "constitutes a danger to the public at large and to young children in particular."</p>
        <p>Judge Hamlin specified that Mr. Timmendequas should serve the maximum. But as everyone with experience in the New Jersey courts knew then, a 10-year sentence  really meant 6 years 8 months with credit for good behavior. Since then, partly  as a result of this case, legislators have been under pressure to change laws to make criminals serve more of their sentences.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Judge Hamlin said he had no illusions that he could make Mr. Timmendequas less of a risk. "I had no thought there was going to be some magic  that was going to happen," he said, "which is why I tried to warehouse him as long as I could."</p>
        <p>Avenel's therapeutic approach to sexual offenders has been criticized for years by some officials who say it coddles offenders and does not provide adequate treatment. Supporters say its therapy represents the only chance that some child molesters and rapists who are destined to return to the streets can gain enough insight to control themselves.</p>
        <p>But both sides say that all sex-offender treatment programs are particularly  frustrated by the many offenders who do not open up to treatment. People who were at Avenel at the time say Mr. Timmendequas never seemed engaged in therapy.</p>
        <p>A former inmate testified before a New Jersey legislative task force on Avenel in 1994. Some inmates refuse to go to treatment at all, he said.</p>
        <p>"You have other people like Jesse Timmendequas, who will go to a group and sit there," said the inmate, who testified with his identity kept confidential.  "They sit there silently, whether it is someone else who has the floor or when the therapist says 'It's your turn to have the floor today.' They kind of muddle their way through."</p>
        <p>Edward D. Balyk, a therapist at Avenel, remembered Mr. Timmendequas.</p>
        <p>"He was a pouter," Dr. Balyk said. "Then he'd go hide. He spent a lot of time in bed."</p>
        <p>The Death of Megan</p>
        <p>Three Molesters Move In Next Door</p>
        <p>At Avenel, Mr. Timmendequas met the two other sex offenders with whom he eventually moved to Megan Kanka's street. One was Brian R. Jenin, five years older than Mr. Timmendequas. In one case involving an 11-year-old boy, according to court records, a judge in Burlington County found that Mr. Jenin had "joined  the Big Brother organization so he could have access to young boys. So he could  sexually molest them."</p>
        <p>The other was Joseph F. Cifelli, who was six years older. In 1976, Mr. Cifelli had been charged with carnal abuse and sodomy of a 5-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty to three counts of impairing the morals of a minor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cifelli's and Mr. Jenin's crimes are the types of acts covered by "Megan's Law." Corrections officials in New Jersey say they think both men have  stayed out of prison since their release from Avenel, but that since they moved  away from the Kanka's block after her slaying, their whereabouts are unknown.</p>
        <p>For a time after Mr. Timmendequas was released from Avenel in 1988, he worked at the Montgomery Township Parks Department as a laborer. In 1991 and 1992, he told the police, he and Mr. Jenin lived together in San Diego. Then, they moved  into the two-story house with white aluminum siding on Barbara Lee Drive that was diagonally across the street from the Kankas' house. The house belonged to Mr. Cifelli's mother, who was 72 and had Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cifelli had lived there as a child and had returned there in 1987 when he was released from Avenel. He and Mr. Timmendequas got jobs in Princeton Township mowing lawns at parks and playgrounds. Mr. Jenin described himself as an unemployed travel agent.</p>
        <p>Some of the neighbors knew about Mr. Cifelli's past. But Megan's mother, Maureen Kanka, who had lived here 16 years, said no one told her about it. She had no reason to worry that evening in the summer of 1994 when Megan went out to look for a friend who lived in the house next to Mrs. Cifelli's.</p>
        <p>For 23 hours after that, neighbors and police searched. They checked parks and trash bins. They used dogs trained to follow a scent. Mr. Timmendequas helped hand out fliers of the little missing girl.</p>
        <p>When the police searched house to house, Mr. Cifelli and Mr. Jenin could prove they had been out doing errands when Megan had disappeared. Mr. Timmendequas seemed nervous, was perspiring heavily and chain smoking, the police wrote in their reports.</p>
        <p>As they learned about Mr. Timmendequas' record, they called around New Jersey. From Middlesex Borough, Detective Sgt. Robert F. Schwarz drove south to  Hamilton Township. Back in 1981, Patrolman Robert F. Schwarz, new on the force,  had arrested the young Jesse Timmendequas who had tried to strangle the little girl in the woods.</p>
        <p>At Hamilton Township's police headquarters, Detective Schwarz introduced himself to Mr. Timmendequas, who, he said, seemed relieved to see a familiar face. Within a few hours, Mr. Timmendequas told the police he had killed Megan while raping her. He was afraid she would tell her mother that he had touched her and tried to kiss her, according to portions of his statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Timmendequas agreed to take the police to Mercer County Park, where, he said, he had left Megan's body in a pile of weeds. Detective Schwarz rode with him. As he described the little girl's death in the car, the detective said, there was no moment when he expressed sorrow for her.</p>
        <p>"Even then," Detective Schwarz said, "he was only concerned about himself: 'How much time am I going to get?' Everything was about himself." In the back of the patrol car, Mr. Timmendequas lay down so Megan's neighbors would not see him.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have said in court that Mr. Timmendequas got Megan into the house by offering to let her pet his new puppy.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kanka, her husband, Richard, and their two other children no longer have to look at the house where Mr. Timmendequas lived. Through their bay window, they now see a small park that has been built in Megan's memory where the house  was.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kanka speaks often around the country, lobbying for the law and warning  parents to take care of their children. She has asked for permission to address  jurors at Mr. Timmendequas' trial, to ask them to impose the death penalty. "They need to understand," she said, "that people get hurt when something like this happens. And it's not something that goes away. It's not any better now than it was the first day."</p>
        <p>Even now, she cannot bring herself to speak his name.</p>
