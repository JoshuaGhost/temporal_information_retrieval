        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 25 front-page article "A Few Miles Apart, 2 Russias Contend for Nation's Future," which aimed at highlighting the contrast between the backward  rural Russia and the cosmopolitan city, appears to have missed the point.</p>
        <p>One would strain greatly to argue that a 28-year-old banker dropping $300 for an antique Lenin poster is typical of today's St. Petersburg. But there is no doubt that the chairman of a nearby collective farm cannot pass for the voice of rural Russia, by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
        <p>The only other rural dweller interviewed was a 61-year-old woman living in the vicinity of the collective farm who remembered that "in the past we had plenty of food." This despite everything we know about the Soviet countryside!</p>
        <p>The vestige of the "collectivization of agriculture," or more precisely the re-enserfment of Russian peasantry, the collective farm your reporter visited and thousands like it have been the blight of Russia's attempts at reforms. The  eradication of the most hard-working and enterprising members of the Russian peasantry in the Stalinist collectivization of the 1930's and the brutal post-World-War-II squeeze, in which millions perished, has caused the Russian countryside incalculable, perhaps even fatal damage.</p>
        <p>One class of people benefited from collectivization: the rural Communist Party-administrative elite, with its lower echelons consisting of collective farm chairmen and directors, one of whom was the focus of your article. Are we supposed to believe that the dying collective farms are seen by rural Russians as a preferred system of agriculture, one that they would like to perpetuate?</p>
