        <p>District attorneys from around the state condemned Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani  yesterday for continuing to challenge the Bronx District Attorney over his prosecution of a man charged in the death of a police officer last week.</p>
        <p>Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney and the president of the New York State District Attorneys Association, said: "It's gotten to the point where enough is enough. No one quarrels with Rudy Giuliani's right to criticize a public official, but when it's a daily occurrence, it goes beyond the bounds of  what's appropriate."</p>

        <p>District attorneys from around the state condemned Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani  yesterday for continuing to challenge the Bronx District Attorney over his prosecution of a man charged in the death of a police officer last week.</p>
        <p>Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney and the president of the New York State District Attorneys Association, said: "It's gotten to the point where enough is enough. No one quarrels with Rudy Giuliani's right to criticize a public official, but when it's a daily occurrence, it goes beyond the bounds of  what's appropriate."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hynes, a Democrat, and other district attorneys of both parties disparaged Mr. Giuliani's understanding of state criminal law. And some said that the Mayor's repeated questioning of the Bronx District Attorney's version of the events leading to the death of Officer Vincent Guidice could threaten the success of the prosecution.</p>
        <p>Ever since Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx District Attorney, announced that he  was seeking manslaughter charges against Anthony Richard Rivers, the man whom Officer Guidice was trying to arrest for domestic violence when he fell on a mirror, the Mayor has denounced Mr. Johnson's approach to the case as phlegmatic.</p>
        <p>The Mayor contended that Mr. Johnson should have charged Mr. Rivers with second-degree murder, which has a maximum sentence of 25 years to life. Manslaughter in the second degree carries a prison sentence of up to 15 years.</p>
        <p>And when a Bronx grand jury indicted Mr. Rivers on Friday for criminally negligent homicide, a lesser crime punishable by up to four years in prison, Mr. Giuliani intensified his criticism, saying Mr. Johnson's office had bungled  the case.</p>
        <p>Until now, other district attorneys have been reluctant to take a public position on the dispute. New York City prosecutors in particular have been in a  bind because they are now negotiating their budgets for next year with City Hall officials; Mr. Giuliani has proposed making small trims in their budgets. District attorneys in counties outside the city said they had wanted to support  a beleaguered colleague but had worried that in doing so, they would risk alienating their own police officers.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Giuliani continued to assail Mr. Johnson, saying that he had failed to present some important evidence to the grand jury, Mr. Hynes called around yesterday morning to the leaders of the district attorneys association. Linking arms, as it were, they began to step forward.</p>
        <p>James M. Catterson, the Suffolk County District Attorney and, like Mr. Giuliani, a Republican, took note of Mr. Giuliani's background as a fellow prosecutor. "A district attorney has an awful burden on his shoulders, particularly at the beginning of a case, and to have a public official second-guessing him is counterproductive," Mr. Catterson said. "If Rudy Giuliani had put himself in Mr. Johnson's shoes, he wouldn't have appreciated anyone telling him what to do."</p>
        <p>When word of the district attorneys' criticism reached Mr. Giuliani yesterday, he responded: "This chorus of 'protect the D.A.' is completely predictable. It would be much more useful and productive if these critics would  help the Bronx D.A.'s office get the maximum protection for cops and the community. So far that hasn't happened and until it does, I will continue to speak out."</p>
        <p>In Syracuse, William F. Dowling, the counsel to the local District Attorney,  William J. Patrick, another Republican, reiterated his baseline support for Mr.  Giuliani. "He's an ex-prosecutor and we love him up here," he said. But he added that even if Mr. Johnson had been able to wrest an indictment of second-degree murder from the grand jury, as Mr. Giuliani had urged, the case would never get  to trial.</p>
        <p>"The defense lawyer would just get it dismissed in the motion stages," said Mr. Dowling, referring to pretrial proceedings. "The facts of this case just don't comport with the murder statute. You could over-indict this case and risk  getting the whole thing dismissed."</p>
        <p>Richard A. Brown, the Queens District Attorney, had started protesting the Mayor's involvement in the Bronx case earlier this week, even though he is one of the district attorneys caught in the budget bind. Mr. Giuliani, he said, has  proposed cutting by about 7 percent the money that Mr. Brown regularly allots for processing cases and arrests. But Mr. Brown said he also admired Mr. Johnson, a colleague whose tough plea-bargain policy Mr. Brown recently adopted  virtually wholesale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's remarks, Mr. Brown said, "undermines Rob's ability to act as the elected chief law enforcement officer in his county and erodes the public's  confidence in the criminal justice system."</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Mr. Brown and Mr. Johnson both appeared at a hearing to ask the City Council to reinstate the proposed cuts.</p>
        <p>"When Rob came in late to the budget hearings," Mr. Brown recalled, "I whispered to him, 'What's the matter? Now they won't let you into City Hall?' "</p>
