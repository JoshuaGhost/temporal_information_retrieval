        <p>Saturday was the first day of a phased voting process across the country. The second phase will be on Thursday, when about 223 million of India's 590 million  voters will be entitled to cast their ballots.</p>
        <p>Most of the balloting today was in the troubled northeastern state of Assam  and in Andhra Pradesh, the home base of Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, whose Congress Party is facing a major challenge in the elections.</p>
        <p>The Election Commission said that the voting today was largely peaceful. Indian news agencies said five people were killed in election-related violence in Andhra Pradesh Monday night and today.</p>
