        <p>Last year, when Joel Robuchon said he would retire at 50, the food world wondered whether it was just an idle threat. But if he did go through with the move and walk away from a Michelin three-star career, who could possibly succeed him at the restaurant that bears his name in the hotel Le Parc in Paris?</p>
        <p>Now, the foo' world has its answers. Mr. Robuchon announced last week that he would retire from the restaurant on July 5, at 51, and that on Aug. 12, Alain Ducasse, the Michelin three-star chef of Le Louis XV in Monte Carlo, Monaco, would take over. Th' restaurant will be renamed Alain Ducasse.</p>

        <p>Last year, when Joel Robuchon said he would retire at 50, the food world wondered whether it was just an idle threat. But if he did go through with the move and walk away from a Michelin three-star career, who could possibly succeed him at the restaurant that bears his name in the hotel Le Parc in Paris?</p>
        <p>Now, the foo' world has its answers. Mr. Robuchon announced last week that he would retire from the restaurant on July 5, at 51, and that on Aug. 12, Alain Ducasse, the Michelin three-star chef of Le Louis XV in Monte Carlo, Monaco, would take over. Th' restaurant will be renamed Alain Ducasse.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ducasse, 39, will not have a minute to spare. He will remain as the chef of Le Louis XV and will be the first chef to try to juggle two three-star dining rooms. He says he likes a challenge.</p>
        <p>"It will only be a problem two days a week and 40 weeks a year," he said.</p>
        <p>Only?</p>
        <p>Mr. Ducasse explained that the Paris restaurant is closed on Saturdays and Sundays, while Le Louis XV is closed on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. And each closes for six weeks during different seasons. "It only takes an hour to fly from one to the other," he added. "And missing a day or so a week in each restaurant is not much. Think of the time most chefs are not in the kitchen."</p>
        <p>At Le Louis XV, the food has a Mediterranean character, but, Mr. Ducasse said, he plans to specialize in updated classic French cuisine in the new Alain  Ducasse restaurant. He will also oversee Relais du Parc, a less formal restaurant in the hotel, and the hotel's room service.</p>
        <p>Somehow, he will also continue to run La Bastide de Moustiers, a country inn  in Provence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robuchon said he wanted to devote time to other ventures, including consulting, writing books and perhaps opening a cooking school.</p>
