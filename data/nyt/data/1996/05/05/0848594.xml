        <p>When you go to apply for your NATO press pass in Zagreb the first thing you notice is that it comes with one line already filled in -- the expiration date:  "December 20, 1996."</p>
        <p>That is the date President Clinton has set for the withdrawal of U.S. troops  from Bosnia. The question I have been posing to a range of people from Zagreb to Sarajevo is: What do you think Bosnia will look like on the day NATO press passes expire? The most common answer is: "Anything can still happen" -- from a  return to fighting to a hard partition to an uneasy coexistence. In other words, with seven months to go before the scheduled end of the NATO mission there is still no clear-cut trend in Bosnia. On any given day, in any given village, you  can see both the forces of unification and the forces of partition busy at work. Though the forces of partition unquestionably have the upper hand, they are not  yet decisive.</p>

        <p>It's like a bad marriage," one U.S. official said of the current state of affairs between Serbs, Croats and Muslims. But as in any bad marriage, he added, the couple could stay together indefinitely for the sake of the kids, in a loveless arrangement, or they could get a divorce.</p>
        <p>Slobodan Lang, a doctor and Croatia's leading human rights activist, described to me a car trip he just took across Croatia and Bosnia, beginning in  the Croatian village of Erdut on the Danube. There he found a meeting of Serbs and Croats, discussing an amnesty for Croatian Serb refugees who want to return  to their homes in the area. Just a few miles after that he came upon an intersection in Bosnia where Serb, Croat and Muslim taxi drivers all gather each day in one taxi station to ferry passengers to either Serb-held Brcko, Muslim-held Tuzla, or Croatian-held Sava. Still farther along, in Croatian-held  Brcko Ravno, he met a Croatian surgeon who had performed 8,700 operations during the war, saving Serbs, Croats and Muslims alike.</p>
        <p>Continuing down to Tuzla, he found that city's Muslim Mayor organizing a business fair there at which Serbian, Muslim and Croatian businessmen were paying 200 German marks apiece to set up showrooms. But along the way, he passed a cemetery where Muslims had broken all the crosses over Croatian graves. In Sarajevo, he visited with angry Muslim refugees, who had managed to survive the  Serbian massacre in Srebrenica and were now occupying the abandoned homes of Sarajevo Serbs, who had fled to the Serb Republic, where they are now living in  squalor. He passed by Mostar, a city divided between Croats and Muslims that is  supposed to be reunited but is instead being partitioned, largely because Croats refuse to share control of the city with their Muslim neighbors. Mostar's division is also being reinforced by Croatian criminal gangs that don't want to  see Mostar reunited because it would be bad for their protection rackets. Mr. Lang ended up in Selce, where a Muslim Croat conference was being held on how to help those left handicapped by the war.</p>
        <p>That's Bosnia today. The only thing that's clear is that while NATO press passes will expire on Dec. 20, the Bosnian conflict will not. There is still too much rage loose in this land. There are still too many people not living in their homes (1.7 million out of a population of 4 million). There are still too  many killers walking free. And, most of all, too many of the leaders responsible for wrecking Bosnia are still around posing as architects of its new dawn. No, there will have to be an ongoing NATO peacekeeping presence here after Dec. 20,  and it will have to include some U.S. forces to have credibility. As long as NATO does not become a target, its remaining here with a smaller force for a longer period is worth it. It's a small price to pay to prevent more mass killing and to insure stability in southern Europe. Anyway, you need a longer cease-fire and period of reconstruction to really test whether a stable new order here is possible.</p>
        <p>"You Americans are like a doctor who wants to help a woman have a baby, but tells her that her pregnancy can only last three months," said Dr. Lang. "Well,  you can't make a baby in three months. You must have more respect for the suffering and the pain and the prejudice that went on here. It is not something  that goes away in a year." That's why everyone is simultaneously rebuilding and  rearming, he added: "If your house was burned, if you were taken away to a concentration camp by your neighbors, and then NATO says, 'We'll help you for a while, but we're leaving by Dec. 20,' you would be a fool not to be preparing  for the next round."</p>
