        <p>IT WAS Andre Previn's day in New York: the one day he had set aside between conducting engagements in Boston and Vienna to meet with managers, colleagues and record-company executives. By the time he ducked into the offices of Columbia Artists Management on this rainy April afternoon, Mr. Previn, who is 66, was running an hour late, looking slightly wilted and admitting to fatigue.</p>
        <p>That his time in the city is at such a premium may seem odd, given his ubiquity on stages in and around New York these days. In recent seasons he has forged a steady relationship with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, New York's premier freelance ensemble. As a pianist, he has played chamber works at the Mostly Mozart Festival and with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. In  1991, he was appointed artistic adviser of the Caramoor Festival in Katonah, N.Y., near his home in Bedford Hills. He conducts and teaches at the Tanglewood  Festival in Lenox, Mass., and he has performed at Carnegie Hall with the student orchestra he coaches at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.</p>

        <p>IT WAS Andre Previn's day in New York: the one day he had set aside between conducting engagements in Boston and Vienna to meet with managers, colleagues and record-company executives. By the time he ducked into the offices of Columbia Artists Management on this rainy April afternoon, Mr. Previn, who is 66, was running an hour late, looking slightly wilted and admitting to fatigue.</p>
        <p>That his time in the city is at such a premium may seem odd, given his ubiquity on stages in and around New York these days. In recent seasons he has forged a steady relationship with the Orchestra of St. Luke's, New York's premier freelance ensemble. As a pianist, he has played chamber works at the Mostly Mozart Festival and with the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. In  1991, he was appointed artistic adviser of the Caramoor Festival in Katonah, N.Y., near his home in Bedford Hills. He conducts and teaches at the Tanglewood  Festival in Lenox, Mass., and he has performed at Carnegie Hall with the student orchestra he coaches at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>He has also become a regular guest of the New York Philharmonic, which he conducts for two weeks starting on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Previn's admission that he has been "dead tired for the last five years," on the other hand, came as no surprise. The quintessential jet-set conductor, he has spent much of the last four decades shuttling between European and American  podiums. After he gave up his last directorship, at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, in 1988, he moved east, went freelance and kicked his career into  overdrive.</p>
        <p>"Oh, it's easily true that I've been busier than ever," Mr. Previn said, settling into a chair in the Columbia Artists board room. "I've composed more during the last 5 years than I had in the previous 10, and I have a whole load of commissions ahead of me. And because chamber music is so plentiful on the East Coast, I'm now playing at least three dozen chamber concerts a year, something I didn't have an opportunity to do when I lived in England or on the West Coast. I am also doing a lot of accompanying, mainly for singers. When you  add all that to my regular schedule, it does get to be a lot."</p>
        <p>His schedule tells a hectic tale. In the last six weeks, for example, he has  conducted the Boston Symphony, the Vienna Philharmonic and the San Francisco Symphony, and made recordings with the violinist Gil Shaham and the soprano Barbara Bonney. After the Philharmonic concerts, he returns to Europe for a tour with the London Symphony -- of which he is conductor laureate and to which he has been known as Sir Andre since he was knighted in January -- and more recordings and chamber music.</p>
        <p>He is booked solidly through February, in fact, and then he will probably spend whatever break he gets composing his first opera, a setting of Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," a collaboration with Philip Littell to be staged by the San Francisco Opera in 1998.</p>
        <p>BUT A MORE TELLING HINT that Mr. Previn may be breezing through life too quickly came when he was asked what was included in a jazz recording he made last summer in Vienna. "I don't remember, I really don't," he said matter-of-factly, adding that he long ago lost count of his recordings. "It's scary," he said. "It's too many, I'm sure of it. Even if I counted only the classical ones, it would be way in excess of 200."</p>
        <p>Mr. Previn's conversation makes clear that he loves being in demand and loves to make music. But what about time to reflect and regenerate?</p>
        <p>"I always reserve the time, and I always renege," he said with barely a trace of wistfulness. "Something always happens. In the summer, I like to play chamber music at the various festivals. I never think of that as work. I think of it as  kind of privileged play time."</p>
        <p>Howard Herring, the executive director at Caramoor, where chamber music makes up about 65 percent of the programming, sees his festival as a beneficiary of Mr. Previn's capacity for overwork.</p>
        <p>"I marvel at Andre's ability to keep an unbelievable number of projects going," Mr. Herring said. "And it's a considerable element of his charm that if you suggest an idea for a program to him, he becomes a fountain of ideas."</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Previn's dense schedule has exacted a cost. Although he says his health is good, apart from an inability to get much sleep, he has had minor heart problems in recent years. And his critics, even those who admire his facility, describe the artistic cost as an inconsistency of inspiration. When his performances click, they can be evocative and full of heart. When they don't, they can be technically solid but superficial. Mr. Previn has, in a sense, inherited Erich Leinsdorf's mantle as a reliable utility conductor.</p>
        <p>"What Andre brings to us is an enormous breadth of repertory," said Deborah Borda, the executive director of the Philharmonic. "He has a special feel for English music and for the American symphonists, and he's willing to explore arcane corners. For that matter, it's not everyone w'o would do an all-Mozart program with a big modern orchestra, as he is about to do with us. It's not politically correct. But he sees it as pure music-making."</p>
        <p>Mr. Previn has always happily burned the candle at both ends. He took his first musical job, orchestrating and eventually composing film scores at MGM, in his teens, as a recent immigrant from Germany. In the 1950's, eager to be taken  seriously in the classical-music world, he began conducting. Between 1961 and 1988, he was music director of the Houston Symphony, the London Symphony, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Los Angeles Philharmonic, all the while continuing to perform and record as a jazz pianist, and compose.</p>
        <p>"One of the reasons I quit the Hollywood scene is that I suddenly realized that the work didn't frighten me anymore," Mr. Previn said. "I think that if you're going to do good work, the work has to scare you, and so I made sure that I went into an area where every day was frightening. If you work in a job where  you can be praised and get another job without worrying, that's a death trap. It's time to do something else."</p>
        <p>Mr. Previn says that there is still plenty to fear on the podium, and he hopes to add many new works to his repertory, including Bruckner symphonies, Mozart operas, Beethoven's "Fidelio" and Debussy's "Pelleas et Melisande."</p>
        <p>But lately, he has been devoting himself more to composing. A stylistic chameleon whose language is conservative and eclectic, he writes to the technical strengths and musical personalities of the soloists who commission him. Now and then he lets the boundary between his jazz and classical sides drop, as i' "Honey and Rue," a collaboration with Toni Morrison composed for Kathleen Battle.</p>
        <p>He recently wrote violin sonatas for Mr. Shaham and Young Uck Kim and song cycles for Ms. Bonney and Sylvia McNair. He is also composing concertos for two  players in the New York Philharmonic, the flutist Jeanne Baxtresser and the trumpeter Philip Smith.</p>
        <p>"You know, all my life," he said, "people have asked me, 'Why don't you just  . . . ?' and you can fill in the blank. Why don't you just compose? Why don't you just play the piano? Why don't you just play jazz? Why don't you just conduct? But I like to do a lot of things, and as long as people allow me to do  them, I will."</p>
