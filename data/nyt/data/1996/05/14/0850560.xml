        <p>Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America, the Japanese car maker that the Government has accused of allowing widespread sexual harassment at a plant in Normal, Ill., said today that it would make "a major announcement" about the case on Tuesday in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Cynthia G. Pierre, a spokeswoman for the Chicago office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is investigating the Mitsubishi case, said late today, "We have not reached a settlement with them."</p>
        <p>A Mitsubishi official confirmed that a settlement would not be announced on  Tuesday. The case drew widespread attention last month when Mitsubishi gave the  plant's workers a day off and provided them with bus transportation to Chicago to demonstrate against the commission.</p>
        <p>Many workers fear that the Government action is adding to pressures that may  be putting the plant and their jobs in jeopardy. Mitsubishi officials in Japan said late last month that the debt-ridden American operation had lost money nearly every year since it opened in 1989.</p>
        <p>The pressures continued to build over the weekend, as the National Rainbow Coalition, a group led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and the National Organization  for Women held demonstrations at Mitsubishi dealerships over the accusations of  harassment.</p>
        <p>Some female workers pursuing their own sexual harassment actions against Mitsubishi have received death threats since the Federal agency filed its class-action lawsuit.</p>
