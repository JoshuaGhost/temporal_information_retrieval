        <p>Nearly 200 people were killed and up to 5,000 injured as a severe storm battered Bangladesh's northern district of Tangail on Monday night, witnesses said today. They said three villages were reduced to ruins by 90-mile-an-hour winds.</p>
        <p>More than 2,000 injured people were brought to one rural hospital at Gopalpur, 40 miles from Tangail town, doctors said.</p>
        <p>But we had the capacity to admit only 35 patients," one doctor said. Witnesses said they had seen many injured still in their homes crying out for help.</p>
        <p>They said hundreds of soldiers had rushed to villages to help police and volunteers</p>
        <p>The police said at least 10,000 houses were destroyed in the district of Tangail, 74 miles from Dhaka, the capital.</p>
        <p>Rescuers have recovered 30 bodies but many more were believed trapped under rubble. Most injuries were caused by flying debris, local journalists and officials said.</p>
        <p>Rescue efforts were hampered because there was no electricity, roads were blocked by fallen trees and communications were disrupted, officials said.</p>
        <p>Witnesses said the sky turned red and the air very hot when the storm struck, leaving trees scorched.</p>
        <p>"Panicked people ran out of their homes fearing for their lives and elderly men went to the mosque to pray," one witness said. The storm also hit the nearby district of Jamalpur, killing at least three people. Five people were killed Sunday night when a storm swept through other areas in the north, local officials said.</p>
