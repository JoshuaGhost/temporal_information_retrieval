        <p>SEVEN months ago, Croation-born Tomo Razmilovic became the new president and  chief operating officer of Symbol Technologies Inc. in Holtsville. Mr. Razmilovic studied electronic engineering at the University of Zagreb in the former Yugoslavia and management at the University of Lund in Sweden.</p>
        <p>He has held positions at Prime Computer and Ericsson in Sweden, and he was the president of ICL Europe as well as ICL International, a major computer system supplier in England. He was the president and chief executive officer of  Cominvest Group, a Swedish high technology company.</p>
        <p>In 1989, he became the senior vice president of international operations for the Symbol Technologies branch in England and four years later became the senior vice president and general manager of Symbol's Worldwide Sales in Bohemia before being promoted to his present post.</p>
        <p>Mr. Razmilovic has lived in England, Sweden and Hong Kong, and now speaks five languages fluently. He is married and the father of two grown sons who live abroad. He lives with his Swedish-born wife on the North Shore of Long Island.</p>
        <p>Although best known for their bar code-based data transaction systems, Symbol Technologies is also heavily involved in the fields of portable computing technology and wireless data communications technology.</p>
        <p>To date, the $555 million company has had more than 200 United States patents issued or allowed.</p>
        <p>Last Tuesday Gov. George E. Pataki attended the opening of Symbol's new corporate headquarters in Holtsville. The building was formerly owned by Grumman Data Systems. Symbol's manufacturing plant will remain at its original location  in Bohemia.</p>
        <p>Q. As a man who's lived and worked around the world, what do you think American businesses can learn from other countries?</p>
        <p>A. I think there is a rule which always applies, and that is, you should always be careful about being complacent about the way that you conduct business outside your own country. No matter how successful or advanced a country is, you must remember that the way you conduct business in your own country is not necessarily the way that you should conduct business in other parts of the world. Depending on the culture, there might be very different needs that have to be addressed with reference to the different types of technology.</p>
        <p>Multinational companies have found out that the labor market is very different in most of the European countries. People there are used to working much longer at the same company, rather than working for just a few years and then leaving. If a company wants to discontinue a relationship with an employee, it can be a very costly and unpopular action.</p>
        <p>It's very important to understand that in Germany, people prefer to do business with other Germans. So if you're an American company, you have to hire  a German manager to deal with German employees, and the same applies in Italy or any other place.</p>
        <p>I think that it's very important to train our people to think laterally and globally. We have people who don't just think about what we need for the United  States, but what we need for the world. That's what we're doing. We are now transferring some people from Europe, and some of our American colleagues here are moving to Europe. Even though it's on a small scale, it's very important.</p>
        <p>Q. Symbol has developed Portable Personal Shoppers. Why were they developed and how do they work?</p>
        <p>There are currently two major trends in the retail industry. Shopping is very different today from what it was in the 60's, 70's and 80's, when consumers considered retailing a leisure activity. When they went shopping, it was fun, and they took their children along with them to the stores.</p>
        <p>There has been a major paradigm shift since then. People see shopping more and more as only a necessity. If that trend continues, retailers will have to change and start spending money on ways to be more effective and efficient.</p>
        <p>In addition, the megatrends that we see everywhere in our society are toward  tougher competition and better service to consumers. If you look at any of the statistics, you'll see that one prime concern that consumers have is the time lost waiting on line at the checkout counter.</p>
        <p>We have developed a system where the customer has an I.D. card which they put into a dispensing unit which will be available in stores. The shopper is then issued a Portable Personal Shopper terminal, which looks something like a portable telephone, and they scan in their own purchases and push the "plus" button as they go around the store. If they want to put something back, they scan it in again, and they push the "minus" button. At a special express checkout, they just give the cashier their cash or credit card. It all goes very quickly.</p>
        <p>We started this project in Europe about two and a half years ago. We are now  set up with this technology at 50 Safeway stores in the U.K. We are also at about two dozen stores in Holland.</p>
        <p>This year, we are going to see a major expansion. We already have several pilot programs in the U.S. that are under way. My guess would be that operations will begin on Long Island at the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Q. How do you think this technology will affect people's lives?</p>
        <p>A. I think that in one way, you could make the case that people's lives might get a bit more boring, but I don't view it in that way. I see that modern society is becoming more effective, more efficient, and the quality of life will be determined in a different way than it was 10 or 20 years ago. People will probably look at their quality of life in a different way when they are doing things like shopping. Time is going to be the most critical factor in people's lives.</p>
        <p>Q. Are there any problems with this device? What if people want to steal and  simply don't scan in items?</p>
        <p>A. Oh, yes, the very first question that comes to mind is the so-called "honesty factor." However, this is relatively easy to control by random checking of a few items. You don't need to check everything in a shopper's cart. And theft in stores is actually down.</p>
        <p>One positive thing here, both for shoppers as well as retailers, is that you  will know in advance the total of your purchases. This increases flexibility and services. Nobody likes to be embarrassed. If you have $100 on you, and you've shopped for $105, you'll know it ahead of time. You won't have to take an item out of your cart and put it back.</p>
        <p>Q. Is there competition in this field, and if so, what is Symbol doing to head it off?</p>
        <p>A. Our view is that there is always going to be competition in any endeavor,  but we will continue our policy of being the first to come out with these new products and systems. At this point in time, we are as innovative as we have always been in the 20 years that our company has existed.</p>
        <p>Q. Symbol was issued 43 new patents last year, for a total of more than 200 since it began operations 20 years ago. Is there anything new being developed this year?</p>
        <p>A. There is something new every day. Our Saturn System is one of our newest products. It is one of the most efficient units that we can put in the hands of  our customers.</p>
        <p>All of corporate America is looking to downsize. They don't want more people  or extra costs. They want to use their existing assets to the maximum. They realize that people have only two hands to work with. If you provide them with a tool which they have to hold with one hand, then by definition, you are taking one hand away from what they can do.</p>
        <p>For example, some employees might have a job moving boxes as well as scanning them. When they scan, they, of course, have to put down their tools to be able to move the boxes. They cannot do both jobs at the same time. The Saturn System  provides a scanner that is worn on the employees' fingers, like a ring, and there is a display that fits on the person's wrist. This way, they can continue  to use both hands for scanning and moving boxes simultaneously. This means that  a corporation doesn't have to add more people to their staff, while still maintaining high efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
        <p>Q. Symbol is best known for its bar code scanning technology at the retail checkout. What other technologies does your company develop?</p>
        <p>A. There is a misperception that we are only a bar coding company.  We are by far the biggest and the foremost leader in that industry, but that's not the only thing we do. We are also a wireless data communications company which provides local area networks and a systems company which provides solutions to the transport distribution industry. We are actually the largest providers of that type of solution in the world.</p>
        <p>We have clients that are parcel delivery companies such as UPS and FedEx. We  have customers in many different countries around the world, and we have over 15,000 sites which are wireless LAN's, or Local Area Networks.</p>
        <p>Q. Symbol's headquarters are on Long Islannd. Where else does your company do business?</p>
        <p>A. We are very much a global company. Forty percent of our business comes from outside the United States. So we are very strongly export-oriented. Seven months ago, we opened a new office in Beijing. We had a major delegation coming  here in January. We opened an office for our Far East operations in Singapore in January 1995 as well.</p>
        <p>We established a subsidiary in Denmark, Symbol Technologies A/S. We also opened a subsidiary in South Africa, which is called Symbol Africa, because we intend to cover the whole African continent from there. We have had an outstanding distributor there and an excellent skilled staff, and we are now reinforcing our operations.</p>
        <p>We had our international distributors' meeting in South Africa at the beginning of February, and I attended with our chairman.</p>
        <p>Q. As the new president, what are your long-range goals for Symbol?</p>
        <p>A. My longer term goals apply to our North American operations as well as international. I would like Symbol to be recognized not only as a key global player, but also as the key player in alliances with other giants in consumer electronics, and with the telephone companies, because our products can be used  in an absolutely outstanding way for data collection with wide area networks and satellite networks. The A.T.&amp;T.'s of the world, the Ericssons and the Siemens are all getting involved in this.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you feel is your greatest challenge?</p>
        <p>A. I think my greatest challenge is to hire people with the right skills. I get my people from all over the world. We have a very multinational team here on Long Island. Actually, over 70 percent of our research and development engineering people are from outside of the U.S. We will continue to find the best skilled people from every corner of the world, and include them in the Symbol team.</p>
        <p>Q. Where would you like to see Symbol five years from now?</p>
        <p>A. Five years from now, I would like Symbol to go from a $555 million company to a billion-dollar-class company. We will continue our global expansion. Most probably, we will have a presence in Japan, some product assembly in the Far East for the Asian market, and we just announced two big strategic alliances with Siemens-Nixdorf and Fujitsu/ ICL.</p>
