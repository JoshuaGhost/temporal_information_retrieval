        <p>The Limited Inc. reported today that its first-quarter profit rose 39 percent on strong sales in its Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch divisions.</p>

        <p>The Limited Inc. reported today that its first-quarter profit rose 39 percent on strong sales in its Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch divisions.</p>
        <p>The specialty retailer, which operates 4,016 stores nationwide, said net income was $28.2 million, or 9 cents a share, in the quarter ended May 4, beating the average estimate of 7 cents a share by 24 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.</p>
        <p>The Limited's pro-forma net income was $20.3 million, or 7 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Last year's results include pro-forma adjustments to  reflect the impact of the company's initial public offering of a 17 percent interest in Intimate Brands Inc., which owns Victoria's Secret. The pro-forma results also reflect the sale of a 60 percent interest in the company's credit card unit, the World Financial Network National Bank.</p>
        <p>Sales for the company, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, rose 13 percent, to  $1.79 billion from $1.59 billion. The company previously reported that its same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least a year, rose 4 percent in the quarter.</p>
        <p>Terence McEvoy, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said that to regain  substantial profitability, the Limited had to figure out what to do with two of  its largest divisions, Lerner New York and Express.</p>
        <p>"We keep hearing new management is coming in, but nothing changes," Mr. McEvoy said. "Lerner was always a budget business. The question is, is there a budget business to be done in the mall?"</p>
        <p>While the company attributed its poor first-quarter results at the Express stores to choosing the wrong fashions to stock, Mr. McEvoy said the deeper problem was a changing customer base. "Their original customers are 20-something or 30-something now, and they are not shopping for the same fashions," Mr. McEvoy said. "But they aren't getting younger customers, either."</p>
        <p>The company's stock rose $1.125, to $21.25.</p>
        <p>Limited operates numerous apparel chains, including Express, Lerner New York, Lane Bryant and Henri Bendel. The company also owns 83 percent of Intimate Brands, which operates 1,336 specialty stores, including Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works.</p>
