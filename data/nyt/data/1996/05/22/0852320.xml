        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A May 17 front-page article describes an inflation-indexed bond the Treasury  Department proposes to issue. But you did not quantify an important economic element of any such bond: that a substantial part of what the Treasury pays would be taken back in income taxes.</p>
        <p>Suppose that to save for college costs, a family in the 28 percent tax bracket invests in the $1,000 bond described in your chart (a 30-year bond paying an annual rate of 3 percent before adjusting for the 5 percent inflation  rate implied in your example). The initial after-tax return is about $22 a year  ($31 less the 28 percent tax).</p>
        <p>Now consider the 10th year. The interest coupon is about $49. The tax bill is $36 -- 28 percent of $49 plus 28 percent of the accretion in principal amount during the year (about $80).  The resulting after-tax amount of $13 equates to slightly less than $8 in first-year purchasing power.</p>
        <p>If inflation or tax rates are higher, the loss of purchasing power in later years becomes even larger, and the after-tax, after-inflation cash return may even be negative.</p>
        <p>The tax burden would be mitigated somewhat if the bond were held in a tax-deferred retirement account, although this arrangement would normally not be suitable for college savings. Alternatively, Congress could enact legislation to provide more favorable treatment than under existing law.</p>
        <p>Apart from these possibilities, the overall after-tax after-inflation return  for the family purchasing the bond in your example appears to be about 0.8 percent a year.</p>
        <p>The Treasury's proposal is intriguing, but let us hope the public discussion  will be mindful of its economic realities.</p>
