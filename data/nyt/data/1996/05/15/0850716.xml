        <p>No one plays the Princess of Wales nearly as well as the Princess of Wales, and most commoners shouldn't even try. The latest attempt comes in a hideous television movie called "Princess in Love," about her romance with Capt. James Hewitt, who started out as her riding instructor, became her lover and eventually sold the story of their affair to a tabloid. Because the film is based on Anna Pasternak's book of the same name, written with Mr. Hewitt's help, it glosses over that last nasty detail.</p>
        <p>Hewitt (Christopher Villiers) comes off as the dashing and handsome hero of an ill-fated romance, the man who helped the love-starved Diana find her self-confidence. Charles (Christopher Bowen) is besotted with Camilla Parker Bowles (Julia St. John), though his best line of dialogue is spoken to his plants: "You've done a splendid job of growing. So proud of you."</p>

        <p>No one plays the Princess of Wales nearly as well as the Princess of Wales, and most commoners shouldn't even try. The latest attempt comes in a hideous television movie called "Princess in Love," about her romance with Capt. James Hewitt, who started out as her riding instructor, became her lover and eventually sold the story of their affair to a tabloid. Because the film is based on Anna Pasternak's book of the same name, written with Mr. Hewitt's help, it glosses over that last nasty detail.</p>
        <p>Hewitt (Christopher Villiers) comes off as the dashing and handsome hero of an ill-fated romance, the man who helped the love-starved Diana find her self-confidence. Charles (Christopher Bowen) is besotted with Camilla Parker Bowles (Julia St. John), though his best line of dialogue is spoken to his plants: "You've done a splendid job of growing. So proud of you."</p>
        <p>All the players seem smarter and better-looking than their real-life counterparts, except for Diana. Played by Julie Cox, an English actress, this Diana is average-looking and a silly goose. Her stature is slight. Her clothes are frumpy. Her hair appears to have been cut and sprayed stiff at some discount salon.</p>
        <p>Much of the story is tediously familiar. Diana battles bulimia. Diana frolics with her children. The unfamiliar parts go out of their way to make her banal. Hewitt takes Diana home to visit his mum. When he is sent to the Persian Gulf war, Diana sits in a chapel wearing a babushka and praying. In real life, of course, Diana is fascinating precisely because she is not ordinary. She is a princess pretending to be ordinary, a distinction this dopey movie doesn't grasp. Even the most obsessive royal watchers are likely to say of "Princess in Love" what the real Diana finally said of Mr. Hewitt: "I was very let down."</p>
        <p>PRINCESS IN LOVE CBS, tonight at 9 (Channel 2 in New York)</p>
        <p>Written by Cynthia Cherbak and based on Anna Pasternak's book. Directed by David Greene. Mike Garfath, director of photography; May Routh, costume designer; Brian Eatwell, production designer. Janet Faust Krusi, Don Kushner and Peter Locke, executive producers.</p>
        <p>WITH: Julie Cox (Diana, Princess of Wales), Christopher Villiers (Capt. James Hewitt), Christopher Bowen (Prince Charles) and Julia St. John (Camilla Parker Bowles).</p>
