        <p>Dennis Rodman, who had some less-than-flattering things to say about Anthony  Mason in his recently released book, "Bad As I Wanna Be," will have an opportunity to let Mason know face-to-face how he feels about him.</p>

        <p>Dennis Rodman, who had some less-than-flattering things to say about Anthony  Mason in his recently released book, "Bad As I Wanna Be," will have an opportunity to let Mason know face-to-face how he feels about him.</p>
        <p>In his first notable pre-series adjustment, Bulls Coach Phil Jackson inserted Rodman back into the starting lineup and sent Toni Kukoc back to the bench. Jackson wants Rodman to defend against Mason, who will match up on the other end against Michael Jordan, and also have Kukoc's offense in reserve.</p>
        <p>Jackson's thinking has to do with two of the most volatile personalities on  the floor canceling each other out. It should be interesting theater.</p>
        <p>"I see Chris Dudley, Derrick Coleman, Dale Davis and Anthony Mason making huge money, and I see injustice," Rodman writes in his book. "Who buys a ticket  to see those guys play?"</p>
        <p>In response to Rodman's statements about Mason and the Knicks having a "yellow streak," Mason said: "I think Rodman is an attention-chaser. Anything he can say to get attention he's going to say. We can't get into a spitting contest." Earlier, Mason said, "What does the guy do, other than rebound?"</p>
        <p>Ewing's Analysis</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing was in a particularly chummy mood today after practice at SUNY Purchase, making 3-pointers from the left baseline and winning steak dinners from those who dared to bet against him.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, however, he will not be left unguarded. And he knows it.</p>
        <p>"I'm going to take what the defense gives me," he said. "If they don't double me, then I'm going to make them pay and I'm going to make them have to double me. If they do, I'm going to try to hit the open man."</p>
        <p>Of rumblings out of Chicago questioning his team's legitimacy, he said: "I don't care what anyone thinks. I think we believe in ourselves and can win. That's the bottom line. They're a great team. They've won 72 games."</p>
        <p>Asked how the Knicks could possibly believe they can beat the Bulls, Ewing added: "I don't even want to get into that. That's for the coaches to analyze. I'm not going to be sitting around and thinking about why they're a good team. If I start to do that, I might as well just walk out on the court and say, 'Hey, this is yours.' "</p>
