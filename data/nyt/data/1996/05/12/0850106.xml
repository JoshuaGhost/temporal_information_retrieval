        <p>FRESH morels are one of the ultimate signs of spring. These intensely flavored wild mushrooms with their crinkled, pointed caps and hollow interiors are gathered only in spring. And though they are also being cultivated in the Middle West, the wild ones, which are not much more expensive and have considerably better flavor and aroma, are still preferable.</p>
        <p>But there are times when the morel of choice is neither wild nor cultivated but dried. While pricey, dried morels cost less than fresh ones, and once they are reconstituted in warm water, they not only make a good substitute for the fresh but they also yield rich mushroom-flavored water to use in a recipe.</p>

        <p>FRESH morels are one of the ultimate signs of spring. These intensely flavored wild mushrooms with their crinkled, pointed caps and hollow interiors are gathered only in spring. And though they are also being cultivated in the Middle West, the wild ones, which are not much more expensive and have considerably better flavor and aroma, are still preferable.</p>
        <p>But there are times when the morel of choice is neither wild nor cultivated but dried. While pricey, dried morels cost less than fresh ones, and once they are reconstituted in warm water, they not only make a good substitute for the fresh but they also yield rich mushroom-flavored water to use in a recipe.</p>
        <p>For stuffing, select the largest fresh morels you can find. To saute and use as a filling for an omelet or a topping for scrambled eggs, fresh are also better. But dried morels are preferable in a risotto or tossed with asparagus in a morel-flavored sauce.</p>
        <p>Scrambled Eggs With Morels  Total time: 15 minutes</p>
        <p>2tablespoons unsalted butter 1ounce fresh morels, rinsed and shaken dry 1teaspoon finely minced fresh shallots Salt and freshly ground black pepper 4eggs, beaten.</p>
        <p>1. Melt half the butter in a small skillet over high heat. Add the morels and shallots and saute until they are tender, about eight minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and remove from the heat.</p>
        <p>2. Melt the remaining butter in a heavy nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the eggs and cook, stirring gently but constantly, until the eggs have coagulated but retain a soft, custardy consistency. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer the eggs to two warm plates and spoon half the morel mixture on top of each portion.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 servings.</p>
        <p>Morels and Asparagus In Beurre Blanc  Total time: 30 minutes, plus soaking</p>
        <p>1ounce dried morels 1cup boiling water 1pound pencil-slim asparagus 9tablespoons softened unsalted butter, in small pats Salt 1tablespoon white-wine vinegar 2tablespoons dry white wine Freshly ground black pepper 1tablespoon chopped fresh chervil.</p>
        <p>1. Put the morels in a dish, cover with boiling water and allow to soak for an hour. Drain, reserving the soaking liquid, then pat the morels dry and spread on paper towels.</p>
        <p>2. Boil the soaking liquid down in a small saucepan until it is reduced to two tablespoons. Set aside.</p>
        <p>3. Snap ends off asparagus and slant-cut in inch-and-a-half lengths.</p>
        <p>4. Heat two tablespoons of the butter in a large skillet. Add the asparagus,  sprinkle with salt and stir-fry about four minutes. Add the drained morels and stir-fry another four minutes or so, until the vegetables are tender. Set aside.</p>
        <p>5. Add the vinegar and wine to the mushroom liquid and cook for one minute. Begin to whisk in the remaining butter, about a tablespoon at a time over low heat, until a thickened, creamy sauce results. Season with pepper.</p>
        <p>6. Divide the asparagus and morels among four plates, spoon some of the sauce over each, dust with chervil and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Risotto With Morels  Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>4ounces dried morels 2cups hot water 3 1/2to 4 cups chicken stock 2tablespoons unsalted butter 1/2cup finely chopped onion 2cloves garlic, minced 1 1/2cups arborio rice 1/3cup dry white wine Freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <p>1. Put the morels in a small bowl, add the water and set aside to soak for 30 minutes. Drain the morels, reserving the liquid. Mix the liquid with the stock and place in a saucepan. Keep at a low simmer.</p>
        <p>2. Heat the butter in a heavy saucepan, add the onion and garlic and saute over medium-low heat until tender but not brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook, stirring, a few minutes until the rice begins to whiten. Add the  wine and the morels. Stir.</p>
        <p>3. Gradually add the simmering stock, about half a cup at a time, stirring constantly. Add additional stock as each ladleful becomes absorbed into the rice. Continue adding the stock until the rice has swelled and is al dente. Continue to cook, stirring, another minute or so. The rice should be just tender and moistened with a thickened sauce.</p>
        <p>4. Serve dusted with Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
