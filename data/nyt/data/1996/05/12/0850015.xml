        <p>To the Editor: At the end of February, my husband and I found some Philadelphia bargains Susan Spano missed ("Frugal Traveler: The City That Poor Richard Could Afford," March 31).</p>
        <p>In the historic district, Comfort Inn Penn's Landing had a weekend rate of $59 for a double, with Continental breakfast and free parking (a real asset in a crowded tourist area). I got the rate by calling Comfort Inn's 800 number a few  weeks earlier. Our spacious, comfortable room lacked only a view. However, the multiwindowed breakfast room, facing the Delaware River, offered not only a view but also the most lavish Continental breakfast we've seen anywhere.</p>
        <p>Our car safely stashed, we walked all the way to Rittenhouse Square, stopping for a free tour of Independence Hall and lunch at the historic Reading  Terminal Market. The bustling, colorful market has a nearly overwhelming welter  of cuisines. We spotted the elegant Passage to India on Walnut Street, where a sumptuous dinner with wine cost $38 for two. (Reservations advised on weekends;  we did have to wait.)</p>
        <p>On Sundays, the justly famous Philadelphia Museum of Art is free from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. We had time to explore Fairmount Park and visit the nearby Rodin Museum, a tiny gem.</p>
