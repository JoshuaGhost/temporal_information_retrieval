        <p>A suit seeking to stop Atlantic City from giving a 150-acre abandoned landfill to a casino developer, Stephen A. Wynn, was dismissed yesterday by a Superior Court judge. The plaintiffs are residents of a neighborhood whose homes would be demolished to make way for a tunnel to serve the site. They claimed that the city had no right to give public land to a private developer and should have included a plan to relocate them in its agreement with Mr. Wynn. But the judge, L. Anthony Gibson, ruled that the public benefits of the land transfer -- a mammoth casino that is projected to create 5,000 jobs and pay $127 million a year in taxes to local and state authorities -- justified the deal, especially since the city had been unable to sell the property.</p>
