        <p>Millers</p>
        <p>Q. When my father used to complain about swarming millers, what kind of moth was he talking about?</p>
        <p>A. Tortricid moths, a family of fairly nondescript dusty-looking moths, are sometimes called millers, according to ''The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders'' (Knopf). They are about  3/8 inch to 1  3/8 inches long.</p>

        <p>Millers</p>
        <p>Q. When my father used to complain about swarming millers, what kind of moth was he talking about?</p>
        <p>A. Tortricid moths, a family of fairly nondescript dusty-looking moths, are sometimes called millers, according to ''The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Insects and Spiders'' (Knopf). They are about  3/8 inch to 1  3/8 inches long.</p>
        <p>The caterpillars, notably those of the codling moth, Laspeyresia pomonella, are destructive orchard pests, with many of them consuming fruits, nuts, roots and sometimes foliage.</p>
        <p>However, the adults, the stage called millers because of their powdery wings, do not feed.</p>
        <p>Miller moths are mottled and usually drab in color, ranging from brown to tan to yellow-gray, as well as black and white. When the square-tipped fore-wings are folded, they are more or less shield-shaped.</p>
        <p>Pretty Poison</p>
        <p>Q. Which Christmas plants are poisonous? Should I worry about the poinsettia?</p>
        <p>A. The poinsettia is not a serious problem, unless your skin is sensitive to the juice from the leaves. The gallery of holiday plants that are more poisonous includes mistletoe (the leaves are worse than the berries); holly; azalea; yew and boxwood, and the Jerusalem cherry, with its deceptively tomato-like miniature fruit.</p>
