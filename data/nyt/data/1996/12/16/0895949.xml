        <p>Struck with the kind of fiscal emergency that other cities have survived and most financial experts agree is manageable, Miami instead finds itself in the throes of an identity as well as a budget crisis.</p>
        <p>As Florida and Miami officials brainstorm to save the city, disaffected residents from several corners can be heard calling for Miami to abolish itself and merge with the government of Dade County, the metropolitan area that more accurately represents what the world knows as Miami. They say they have gathered 20,000 signatures, enough to call a referendum on the question  next year, although their petition still needs to be certified by election officials.</p>
        <p>The anti-cityhood drive has been fueled by anger over a corruption scandal that recently snared three top Miami officials and a $68 million deficit uncovered shortly afterward. But its roots lie in a trend that has been in evidence for most of the decade. Since 1991, unincorporated, mostly affluent areas of Dade County have lined up to form into cities, three of them successfully, and assume control of their tax dollars. If Miami's government structure were abolished, wealthier sections of the city that have been itching to break away, like Coconut Grove, would suddenly be free to do the same.</p>
        <p>Such fragmentation is seen across the urban landscape nationwide as growing areas have formed small communities, not unlike gated neighborhoods that wall themselves off seeking a safe haven, urban geography experts say. But if the higher-income areas splinter off, Dade County will have to share its resources and services with the remains of an already poor city. Miami, with a population of about 350,000, is the fourth poorest city in the country, according to U.S. Census figures.</p>
        <p>About 1.1 million of Dade County's 2 million residents still live in unincorporated areas, with the rest scattered among 29 municipalities.</p>
        <p>But at least five cityhood votes are pending or being proposed for approval by Dade County Commissioners by communities that sometimes pay more in taxes than they get back in services or want to control police protection, zoning and other key matters. ''One of the big negatives here is that should Miami become part of Dade County, you'll see a tremendous intensification of the movement to try to secede from Dade,'' said Peter Muller, an urban geographer at the University of Miami in Coral Gables. ''It's hard for me to see Miami would be much better off.''</p>
        <p>Max Castro, a sociologist with the University of Miami's North-South Center, said, ''The proposal to abolish Miami is part of a larger trend toward class and ethnic vulcanization of urban space and economic polarization of American society.''  But while critics of abolition say it would leave poorer areas in worse shape than before, proponents of doing away with Miami, led by downtown property owners and homeowners associations and residents from Coconut Grove and other higher-income neighborhoods, say every Miami resident would benefit from a tax rate in Dade County that is half what they pay Miami now.</p>
        <p>Gene Stearns, the lawyer who successfully led the incorporation drive of Key Biscayne and who said his  firm is donating ''thousands'' of hours to the abolition effort, said there was no question that some sections of Miami would seek to incorporate if the city dissolved itself. But he said a way to help out those sections that cannot sustain themselves through taxes would be to require cities to contribute some revenue to a countywide fund.</p>
        <p>''Whatever the source of funding, this county will have to come up with a revenue source to provide money to these areas,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If the city disappears as a legal entity, what would happen to the name Miami? Mr. Stearns said Miami would continue to be the brand name for the metropolitan area that includes cities such as Miami Beach and Coral Gables. ''The city of Miami gives Miami a bad name,'' Mr. Stearns said.</p>
        <p>But others are not so sure. Opposition to dissolving the city is widespread. ''Dade County can run into problems, any place can run into these problems if they're not careful what they do,'' said David Beckford, 45, a comptroller for a downtown business. He said he opposed abolition because ''It's swapping one government for another.''</p>
        <p>Dade County's Mayor, Alex Penelas, said that a revenue-sharing program would be essential if the incorporation fever continues, but he said he was philosophically opposed to dissolving Miami because the county government should be a provider of regional services such as transportation, indigent health care and environmental regulation and not become a local service provider.</p>
        <p>Mr. Penelas shares the view of many residents who say abolition is too drastic and uncertain a step. ''It's somewhat extreme,'' he said of the abolition drive. ''I think and hope that the city can survive.''</p>
        <p>So does Gov. Lawton Chiles, who last week appointed a state oversight board to help steer Miami, the state's second-largest city after Jacksonville, toward solvency. State officials say Miami's fiscal emergency has the potential to affect the bond ratings and interest rates paid by both the state and its other cities because the financial markets are paying close attention to how Florida deals with the crisis. Lieut. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who heads the oversight board, said Friday through a spokesman that the decision to abolish the city is up to the people of Miami but should be made independently of the financial problems.</p>
        <p>Some who oppose splitting Dade County into little fiefs say Miami nevertheless is long overdue to vote itself out of the map. The city has intractable problems that have made it ''drag along like a wounded snake for years,'' said Dan Paul, the Miami lawyer who drafted the county charter in 1957.</p>
        <p>Although Miami officials attribute the financial crisis to previous mismanagement, Mr. Paul and others said that the city also has suffered from a tax base that is insufficient to meet its required services and debt obligations, giving it a structural deficit despite charging the highest property taxes in the county. Mr. Paul said Dade County's metropolitan government structure, which duplicates many of the city's functions, was created largely envisioning that Miami, hobbled by financial crises and corruption even then, would someday merge with it. ''We're now running two metropolitan cities within blocks of each other,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Miami is a vastly changed city from what it was in the 1950's, when waves of Cuban exiles fled Fidel Castro's government. Census figures showed that by 1990 more than 62 percent of the city's then 358,548 residents were of Hispanic origin, most of them Cubans. Many find abolition unthinkable.</p>
        <p>''If this city disappeared it would be party time for Fidel and the people over in Cuba,'' said Heliodoro Coro, owner of two Little Havana restaurants. ''The whole world knows that Cubans have worked hard to make this city what it is, to build businesses here, to make a life for ourselves. For those of us who came here, Miami is very important.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  December 17, 1996, Tuesday</p>
        <p>Because of a telephone dictation error, an article yesterday about Miami's financial turmoil rendered a word incorrectly in a quotation from Max Castro, a sociologist, about calls for the city to merge with the government of Dade County. Mr. Castro said, ''The proposal to abolish Miami is part of a larger trend toward class and ethnic Balkanization of urban space and economic polarization of American society.'' (He did not say ''vulcanization.'')</p>
