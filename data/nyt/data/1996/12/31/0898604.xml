        <p>Spurred by falling mortgage rates, sales of existing homes rebounded smartly in November after five straight months of declines. For the year, sales are headed for a record total of more than four million, figures compiled by the National Association of Realtors showed today.</p>
        <p>The unexpected 1.8 percent increase last month all but guaranteed that 1996 would surpass 1978, when 3.99 million homes were sold, as the most active on record. The increase also suggested that housing might help propel the economy to brisk expansion in the early months of the new year.</p>
        <p>''This economy is gaining a bit of momentum here,'' John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns &amp; Company, said. ''It's pretty robust in the fourth quarter, and if housing is picking up, we could be looking at a couple of quarters running well ahead of people's expectations.''</p>
        <p>Another report today also pointed to continuation of the business expansion, which will soon reach its sixth anniversary without significant interruption.</p>
        <p>The Conference Board calculated that the index of leading indicators edged up one-tenth of 1 percent in November, the 10th month in a row without a decline.</p>
        <p>Securities markets registered no obvious reaction to the data, which came as many Wall Street firms have given their employees extended holidays or have effectively closed their books for the year.</p>
        <p>Still, the housing figures were seen as significant because few analysts had predicted an increase in sales of existing homes, which though running at a rapid clip this year had eased each month since May.</p>
        <p>''It picked up a bit stronger than I expected it would,'' said Marlene K. Grabau, economist at HSBC Securities in Washington, noting that she expected figures for the next couple of months to remain high.</p>
        <p>That is because interest rates have declined since late summer, when most contracts were signed for homes on which buyers closed in November.</p>
        <p>''The housing market is in fine shape,'' Russell K. Booth, the realtor association's president, said in a statement. ''Confidence is strong once again, and this is resulting in heavy activity in markets coast to coast.''</p>
        <p>The trade group predicted that resales of single-family homes would total 4.09 million for the year.</p>
        <p>Considerable economic activity is generated when a home changes hands, from spending on repairs by sellers and redecorating by buyers to the host of fees, commissions and taxes involved in the transaction.</p>
        <p>Regionally, the Midwest showed a 4.9 percent surge in sales last month. That was followed by the West, up 4.5 percent. Sales edged up just seven-tenths of 1 percent in the South, while in the Northeast they slumped 4.8 percent from the October pace.</p>
        <p>A total of 2.24 million houses were for sale last month, enough to last 6.6 months at the November selling pace. In October there was a seven-month supply of unsold houses.</p>
        <p>The association's report also showed a median sales price for transactions completed last month of $117,400. For 1996 over all, the association projected a median price of $117,700, up 4.2 percent from the 1995 level.</p>
        <p>In the report on leading economic indicators, the Conference Board said that 5 of the 10 components contributed positively, led by higher stock prices and an expansion of the money supply.</p>
        <p>The biggest negative was a decrease in the interest-rate spread -- the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds minus the rate on overnight bank loans -- which was incorporated in the index for the first time. Two components were removed, sensitive materials prices and unfilled orders for durable goods.</p>
        <p>These changes, announced in mid-November, were aimed at limiting false signals of a turn in the direction of the economy, such as seemed to occur when the index, then under the auspices of the Commerce Department, fell for five straight months at the beginning of 1995.</p>
        <p>The companion coincident and lagging indexes advanced three-tenths of 1 percent and one-tenth of 1 percent, respectively, in November, the board's report also showed.</p>
