        <p>Buffalo Bills center KENT HULL retired yesterday after an 11-year career that included four straight Super Bowls.</p>
        <p>Hull, considered the best center in Bills history, became the first to retire of the eight remaining Bills players who appeared in all four Super Bowls. He leaves the game without winning one.</p>
        <p>''I've decided to close this chapter in my life,'' Hull said during an emotional news conference in Orchard Park, N.Y. ''It's been a great ride for me. I've had an opportunity to play with Hall of Fame players, a Hall of Fame coach and, without a doubt, the greatest fans in the world.''</p>
