        <p>Your Dec. 1 news article on Mohamed al-Fayed's legal battle to compel the British Government to come clean about its reasons for denying him a passport misrepresents me in one important particular.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Dec. 1 news article on Mohamed al-Fayed's legal battle to compel the British Government to come clean about its reasons for denying him a passport misrepresents me in one important particular. I have never said that Mr. Fayed altered some of the facts of his life when he was buying the House of Fraser, the parent company of Harrods.</p>
        <p>During the company's takeover in 1985, statements were made on behalf of Mr. Fayed's merchant bank that were somewhat exuberant. This was not unknown in the go-go 1980's, and Mr. Fayed did not make those statements, nor was the issue of his family background crucial to the decision to allow his bid to succeed. The Department of Trade and Industry was concerned only whether there was a monopoly consideration, and as Mr. Fayed had no other retail interests, there was not; and whether he and his brothers had the money to pay shareholders, which they did.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fayed has never been coy about his Egyptian origins, but after 30 years of living in England he is loyal to its Royal Family, its institutions and its people, 2,500 of whom have written to support his struggle for citizenship. If the Government has good reason for refusing him a passport, Mr. Fayed wants to know what it is so that he may challenge it in the courts. In America you have adopted much of English common law, but you apply it with more consideration.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL COLE  Dir. of Public Affairs, Harrods  London, Dec. 2, 1996</p>
