        <p>In most neighborhoods, highway construction work is bad news. But in Chelsea, the current rejiggering of the West Side Highway brought an unforeseen boon: a newer, larger park at 23d Street between 11th Avenue and the highway. Because the rebuilt roadway will plow through the existing Thomas F. Smith Park, the Federal Government agreed to pay about $1.5 million to more than quadruple the amount of park space.</p>
        <p>Last June, after nearly a decade of debate, a task force of park advocates and state transportation officials agreed on a design to turn 23d Street west of 11th Avenue into a pedestrian pathway, flanked on either side by 2.5 acres of lawns, ball fields and play areas.</p>

        <p>In most neighborhoods, highway construction work is bad news. But in Chelsea, the current rejiggering of the West Side Highway brought an unforeseen boon: a newer, larger park at 23d Street between 11th Avenue and the highway. Because the rebuilt roadway will plow through the existing Thomas F. Smith Park, the Federal Government agreed to pay about $1.5 million to more than quadruple the amount of park space.</p>
        <p>Last June, after nearly a decade of debate, a task force of park advocates and state transportation officials agreed on a design to turn 23d Street west of 11th Avenue into a pedestrian pathway, flanked on either side by 2.5 acres of lawns, ball fields and play areas.</p>
        <p>But at the same time another state agency, the Hudson River Park Conservancy, was planning a 9.5-acre recreation area on the west side of the highway, part of a waterfront park that will stretch from Battery Park City to 59th Street. Chelsea Waterside Park, as it's known, is to be a rugged swath of greenery, in  marked contrast to its more structured, partly paved counterpart to the east.</p>
        <p>Last month, trying to bring the plans into sync, the conservancy asked the State Transportation Department to reconsider its designs for Thomas F. Smith Park. To many Chelsea residents, the requested modifications were fighting words. ''All of a sudden, the tail is wagging the dog,'' said Robert S. Trentlyon, president of the Chelsea Waterside Park Association. ''It's outrageous, considering the years of consensus-building that went into this.''</p>
        <p>At issue is the conservancy's suggestion that the pedestrian corridor at 23d Street be eliminated to cut down on access to an expanse of grass they envision for their park west of the highway. A landscape architect for the roadway construction project, Heather Sporn, said the conservancy expressed concern that pedestrians crossing the highway at 23d Street to get to the water's edge would trammel a pristine lawn. ''It seems to be their concern, but I think we could live with either plan,'' Ms. Sporn said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the conservancy, John Melia, was more terse. ''There is no favorite plan,'' he said. ''To characterize us as preferring one over the other is wrong.'' However, conservancy officials who insisted on anonymity said they hope to prevail. The board will hold hearings on the proposed design for Thomas F. Smith Park on Jan. 8. The designer, Thomas Balsley, says he has already adjusted his plans to better fit those of the conservancy.</p>
        <p>''The 23d Street corridor is not just a symbolic gesture but a physical link between Chelsea and the water,'' he said. ''After working for eight years on this project, the thought of changing it just kills me.''</p>
