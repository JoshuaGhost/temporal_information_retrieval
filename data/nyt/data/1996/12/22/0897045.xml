        <p>IF a new study of the telecommunications industry has it right, the best place to look for promising stocks may be among the worst performers.</p>
        <p>Simon Flannery, a telecommunications analyst with J. P. Morgan Securities, has examined five years of industry data and found that stocks that underperform the sector in one quarter tend to outperform the sector in the next quarter.</p>
        <p>''It's a trading pattern that's pretty unusual but not that recognizable,'' Mr. Flannery said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the pattern has held true 80 percent of the time since 1992, and for the last 11 quarters. In his study, Mr. Flannery defined the industry as the seven Baby Bells along with AT&amp;T, GTE, MCI Communications and Sprint.</p>
        <p>Most important, the turnabout stocks have outperformed the sector by a wide margin. An investor who followed Mr. Flannery's core strategy would buy the three stocks that performed the most poorly in a quarter; performance would be measured by total return, which includes both stock-price changes and dividends. The investor would hold those stocks for the current quarter and then exchanging them for the next group of bad performers. The results of this strategy over the last five years? The investor would have earned an average annual return of 23.67 percent -- almost double the 12.65 percent average for the sector.</p>
        <p>Why does this pattern hold? The answer is not clear, but Mr. Flannery offers several possibilities. For example, poor performers may work harder the next quarter, or investors may believe certain problems are company specific when in fact the damage is industrywide.</p>
        <p>Curiously, this ''worst becomes best'' tactic runs counter to conventional wisdom, at least when it comes to the Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and other broad market groups. Buying last year's (or last quarter's) losers in such groups ''is absolutely the worst strategy in the broader market,'' said James O'Shaughnessy, of O'Shaughnessy Capital Management in Greenwich, Conn. Mr. O'Shaughnessy is the author of ''What Works on Wall Street'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996), which tracks the success of various market strategies in recent years.</p>
        <p>One tactic that also focuses on poorly performing stocks but does seem to work is the ''Dogs of the Dow'' strategy. In it, investors buy  each year the 10 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average that are the highest dividend yielders. But the method used in the telecommunications study selected the worst stocks by total return, and that strategy has fared very badly with broad market groups.</p>
        <p>However, the worst-return approach apparently works well when confined to the telecommunications industry, based on Mr. Flannery's research, and it works even better when an investor chooses the two worst telecommunications stocks each quarter instead of three.</p>
        <p>Although the two-company approach is a bit riskier, it provided an average annual return that was 12.17 percentage points higher than the sector as a whole during the five years of the study, versus the 11-point advantage for the three-company approach.</p>
        <p>Fancier and even reverse strategies suggested by Mr. Flannery's research -- like shorting the three best performers each year, which means betting that they will decline -- also enable an investor to outdo the sector averages, he found.</p>
        <p>For those interested in just the basic three-company strategy, the laggards of the fourth quarter, as of Friday's close, are BellSouth, Sprint and U S West.</p>
        <p>Before investors embrace this method, however, Mr. O'Shaughnessy would caution them about the length of the period studied. ''Five years isn't a very long time,'' he said. And even if the pattern holds 80 percent of the time, it does not hold the other 20 percent of the time. As of Wednesday, for example, the three laggards from last quarter -- AT&amp;T, GTE and BellSouth -- were still behind the sector average this quarter.</p>
        <p>MOREOVER, rebalancing a portfolio every three months can be costly, both in taxes and in commissions. And though the pattern Mr. Flannery has found holds for any three-month period -- not just for calendar quarters -- it does not hold year to year, a pattern that would make the tactic less expensive. Nevertheless, investors may decide that the strategy's sizable excess returns over the sector make it worthwhile despite the costs. Also, if the buying and selling are done in a tax-deferred retirement account, the taxes can be bypassed and commissions may be lower because brokerage firms sometimes reduce their fees for regular transactions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flannery said his theory might even be useful to investors  who were undecided about where to put their money: ''If you are looking at two stocks in the sector,'' he said, ''buy the one that did poorly in the preceding three months.''</p>
