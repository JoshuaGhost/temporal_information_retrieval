        <p>The losses in stocks, bonds and the yen have partly reflected concern about the nation's weak economic outlook and a new budget, released this week, that ends a tax reprieve and imposes a higher sales tax.

        <p>As stock prices on Wall Street moved higher this week, the Japanese financial markets headed largely in the opposite direction, and the Finance Minister made comments today that appeared aimed at calming the jitters.</p>
        <p>The losses in stocks, bonds and the yen have partly reflected concern about the nation's weak economic outlook and a new budget, released this week, that ends a tax reprieve and imposes a higher sales tax. Analysts said there were also fears of a selloff of Japanese stocks by foreign investors, who have been retreating from the market in the last few weeks as they prepared to settle their year-end accounts.</p>
        <p>The benchmark Nikkei index of 225 stocks rebounded today, rising 77.46 points, or four-tenths of 1 percent, to close at 19,369.04. But for the week over all, it lost 1.6 percent of its value -- on Thursday, trading below the 19,000 level for the first time in about a year.</p>
        <p>The Japanese currency weakened to its lowest exchange rate since April 1993 against the dollar, which settled above 115 yen today. And Japanese bond prices sank for the fourth day in a row.</p>
        <p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said today that he would closely monitor the markets. But he denied that prices had fallen because of the big increase in the sales tax, which was included in the Government's budget announced on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''The market moves according to market principles,'' he said. He added that without the tax increase, to 5 percent from 3 percent beginning on April 1, along with an end to the special tax cuts created to break a recession, the Government would be forced to issue more debt, straining national finances.</p>
        <p>''Reckless issuance of deficit-covering bonds will lead to vicious inflation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some analysts warned that the markets were near levels that might pose difficulties for policy makers. During trading on Thursday, the weakening yen prompted Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to declare that it was a strong dollar, not a weak yen, that was the problem. But when the Nikkei average's loss exceeded 700 points at one point during the session, the Prime Minister expressed concern about sinking stock prices. The index recouped some of those losses but still finished down 257.83 points for the day.</p>
        <p>Should the Nikkei fall below 19,000 and head toward 18,000, there could be capital adequacy problems among some of the nation's financial institutions. Many Japanese banks are thinly capitalized and are struggling to recover from several hundred billion dollars in bad real estate loans.</p>
        <p>To help support their capital base, big banks in many cases rely on unrealized gains from stocks bought years ago. But a sinking stock market could erase those potential share gains and nibble away at the banks' capital base, forcing the Government to step in.</p>
        <p>Partly as a result of such worries, the shares of bank stocks fell today even as other popular stocks, like the Toyota Motor Corporation, rose to record highs. Toyota gained 40 yen, to close at 3,320 yen, or $28.87. But Sakura Bank declined 17 yen, to 843, and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking slipped 10 yen, to 1,600.</p>
        <p>''The soft stock market is likely to last through the first quarter,'' said Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at CS First Boston Ltd. here.  ''There will be an effort among Japanese investors, for if they sell, they will be hurting themselves. They'll be holding each other's hands to keep the stock market from falling further.''</p>
        <p>The Economic Planning Agency recently released a lackluster economic outlook for Japan, with growth expected to be only 1.9 percent in the fiscal year, beginning on April 1. It was the lowest Government forecast since the end of World War II, and some Japanese economists offered even lower projections, helping contribute to the sour market sentiment.</p>
        <p>''When we Japanese are faced with a choice between a bright and a gloomy outlook, we tend to choose the gloomy one,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager of equity operations at the Nikko Securities Company. ''Japanese are pessimistic. But I personally think the economy has been on a slow recovery track since 1993. There may be some bumps along the way, but I think that the economy will pick up in the second half of next year.''</p>
        <p>The Nikkei average has fallen during the final two months of the year in 7 of the last 10 years, according to Ms. Sasaki-Smith. This year in particular, with most markets elsewhere in the world soaring, foreign investors began dumping their yen holdings, pushing down the currency's exchange rate, analysts said.</p>
        <p>With the yen weakening against the dollar, foreign investors also began selling Japanese stocks before closing their books for 1996. In such selloffs, some of the money usually flows into bonds. But some analysts said that Japanese institutional investors sold some of their bonds to lock in gains in preparation for their fiscal-year-end settling of accounts at the end of March.</p>
        <p>Toshihiko Masaki, head of foreign exchange trading at Citibank in Tokyo, said that currency trading had also been thin, meaning that modest selling can produce large changes in the value of the yen.</p>
        <p>He added that Japanese individual investors also played a significant role in pushing down the yen's value. Very low interest rates in Japan have encouraged individuals to buy foreign securities offering higher yields.</p>
        <p>''The locomotive has been individual investors,'' Mr. Masaki said.</p>
