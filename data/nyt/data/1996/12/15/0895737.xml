        <p>FEW people like to ponder their inevitable appointment with the Grim Reaper, but those who believe their day may be drawing near are fast becoming big clients of the adventure-travel industry.</p>
        <p>Faced with fatal or serious illnesses, people who could travel were once content to spend their free time popping bonbons in Paris or sunbathing in Florida. Now they are more apt to go all out, assuming their illnesses leave them the strength to do so. Travel agents say this gusto has bolstered the market for extravagant trips and expensive fantasy vacations that include everything from taking a motorboat down the Amazon to hiking past cobras in an African jungle.</p>
        <p>''If you've just been diagnosed with full-blown cancer, you're not going to take your assets and go out and buy real estate,'' said Lynette Wilson, owner of Destination World, a travel planning company in Santa Barbara, Calif. ''Instead, people sell their insurance policies and take their friends on an exotic vacation.''</p>
        <p>Even though there are no travel agencies that specialize in adventure trips for the ailing, traditional agents say they are seeing more requests. Part of the increase is a result of the rising number of companies that buy life insurance policies for cash and the growing popularity of adventure travel in general.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, most of the people who take one of our adventure vacations are not dying,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''So they appeal to everyone. But it's interesting, you know. We've never advertised this part of our business, and yet there are a lot of folks out there who are ill and want to try an adventure trip. They want to use their imaginations.''</p>
        <p>Adventure travel, by definition, involves some sort of outdoor activity. Traditionally, the most popular exotic fare was an African safari. But animal gazing is just too lame for many ailing travelers. Perhaps they are in denial or rebelling against their disease, but most ailing tourists want as strenuous a workout as they can handle.</p>
        <p>''The people who are sick who come to us for a vacation almost always want to do something really physical,'' said Hanns Ebensten, president of Hanns Ebensten Travel in Key West, Fla. ''They've been to Paris. They figure, 'Now's the time to do what I always wanted and didn't.' ''</p>
        <p>Adventure trips can also be great therapy. Sally Berg, a breast cancer survivor, decided 10 years ago to take her cancer support group from Mount Kisco, N.Y., backpacking in Bethel, Me. They went on the first of several Outward Bound trips for breast cancer victims. Another Outward Bound trip, in 1988, took her whitewater rafting down the Yampa River in Utah and Colorado.</p>
        <p>''My first thought when I was diagnosed with cancer was that I was going to die,'' Mrs. Berg said. ''But then I realized that I wasn't going to die this week and maybe not even this year. Doing the canoeing and other adventure trips I've taken helped me to know my limits. It gave a meaning to my illness.''</p>
        <p>Like other adventure tourists, ailing travelers have plenty of trips to choose from. In addition to offering rafting trips and safaris, many agencies book personalized vacations, enabling anyone to fulfill a wish, regardless of how farfetched it may be.</p>
        <p>One man who was dying of AIDS decided last year to float down the Nile. Instead of booking passage on a ship, he and a group of friends boarded a centuries-old sailboat. He ended his trip by crossing the Sinai Peninsula in a Land Rover, spending each night huddled in a sleeping bag in the sand.</p>
        <p>Other ailing travelers want to live another life. Last year, Mr. Ebensten arranged a trip for a dying man to Mount Athos, Greece. There, he stayed with the monks four nights, in four different monasteries, helping with the chores and praying.</p>
        <p>''That trip is very moving,'' Mr. Ebensten said. ''They have a rather basic guest quarters. You really do live a medieval life.''</p>
        <p>ADVENTURE trips can provide ailing travelers with an emotional release, but they must be chosen carefully. Because these trips are often elaborate, with itineraries that cross several countries and currencies, they are usually quite expensive. The sailboat tour down the Nile went for $6,000, excluding air fare, while the weeklong stay at the Greek monastery -- certainly no Hilton --cost $5,000, excluding air fare.</p>
        <p>A typical tourist may balk at such a bill, but few ailing travelers do. They often have few concerns about money, travel agents say, because many have already cashed in their life insurance policies for one last blast, not expecting to survive their illnesses.</p>
        <p>''Generally, their attitude is that they have the money now so why not splurge,'' Mr. Ebensten said. '' 'Why keep the money, when I can see the monastery and do all those things I always wanted to do?' ''</p>
        <p>If money is not a problem, health usually is. Travel agents usually make sure the trip's physical demands are not too pressing, but sometimes the strains -- like hauling equipment on a hike or spending a long day in a rowboat -- are unavoidable when an ailing tourist travels with a group of healthy strangers.</p>
        <p>Many of those problems can be allayed with a little planning. ''Most people travel with a traveling companion,'' Mr. Ebensten said. ''There have been times when someone has arrived off the plane, and I'll think, 'Oh, no, he's not going to make it.' But he always does. Doing a physical vacation is so much a matter of the mind.''</p>
        <p>People who are too sick for an adventure trip have other options. Dalmation Dreams, a nonprofit group in Santa Barbara, fulfills last wishes for dying adults. Most of the 14 requests it handles each month are for family reunions, or putting a sick person in touch with a hero. One dying man not only met Glenn Close but actually sang with her for about an hour.</p>
        <p>For the ailing traveler longing for the outdoors, however, there are few bounds. Ms. Wilson is booking clients on a tour of Transylvania over next Halloween.</p>
        <p>But the truly daring may try the 16-day excursion in August to Bali and Tana Toraja, an area in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Keeping with local tradition, the Torajans who are dying have a life-size model carved in wood by the village artisan. Funeral season in Tana Toraja is in August, and everyone is laid to rest at once. On top of being allowed to witness the three-day service, tourists can hike about the remote Indonesian island.</p>
        <p>''I used to say that you should not try an adventure trip if it's not your cup of tea,'' Mrs. Berg said. ''But now I think everyone should try one, regardless if you're sick. You see things you never would have before, and more importantly, you discover what you're capable of. You come away from it realizing you were stronger than you thought.''</p>
