        <p>In what the sponsors call a move to foster peace in the Middle East, the Red Sea International Music Festival will be held between Jan. 9 and 12, and for the first time will take place in both Israel and Jordan. The orchestra and chorus of the Kirov Opera of St. Petersburg under Valery Gergiev will take part, playing in Eilat, the southernmost city of Israel, and in Aqaba, Jordan, which is within walking distance of Eilat at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba.</p>
        <p>On the opening day, in Eilat, the orchestra and chorus will offer the Verdi Requiem with Sharon Sweet, soprano; Marina Tarasova, mezzo-soprano, and Sergei Alexashkin, bass, as soloists. On Jan. 10 the festival will move across the border to Aqaba for the premiere of works commissioned from Charbon Shalayev, a Tagikistani composer, and Oded Zehavi, an Israeli. Also on that program will be Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Scheherazade,'' Mussorgsky's ''Night on Bald Mountain'' and Ippolitov-Ivanov's ''Caucasian Sketches.'' On Jan. 11, back in Eilat, two programs will be offered, an a capella concert by the opera chorus at 11 A.M. and an orchestral concert at 9 P.M. titled ''Romeo and Juliet in Music'' with the Berlioz symphony and the Prokofiev ballet suite on the program. The final concert, also in Eilat, will feature Borodin's ''Polovstian Dances'' and Prokofiev's ''Peter and the Wolf.''</p>
