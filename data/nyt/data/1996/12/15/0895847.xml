        <p>When a Soviet fighter shot Korean Air Lines Flight 007 out of the sky over Soviet territory 13 years ago, Moscow kept the pilot under wraps. But now Gennadi Osipovich, the 52-year-old retired pilot who pulled the trigger, is free to tell his story. And his first-hand account raises new questions about the Soviet military's role.</p>
        <p>Mr. Osipovich said he had no doubt that the plane he downed over Sakhalin Island was a civilian aircraft. He also acknowledged that he did not tell Soviet ground controllers that the intruding aircraft was a civilian Boeing. But, steeped in the ideology of the cold war, Mr. Osipovich believed -- and still thinks -- that the civilian plane must have been in the service of the Central Intelligence Agency. Mr. Osipovich said his only regret is that he did not receive a large enough bounty for shooting down the plane.</p>
