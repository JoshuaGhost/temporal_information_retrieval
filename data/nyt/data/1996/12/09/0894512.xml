        <p>Jet travel may have lost its novelty, but something else is coming to aircraft cabins: all the passive entertainment of television, from the 24-hour drone of cable news to re-runs of ''Bewitched'' to live sporting events.</p>
        <p>Computer entertainment is coming, too, with a power outlet for passengers' laptop computers just around the corner. A telephone is already in the seat-back, and low-speed modem connections have recently arrived; the World Wide Web could follow.</p>
        <p>Delta Air Lines took a big step to converting its cabins into ''living rooms in the sky'' in August, when it installed a satellite TV antenna on a Boeing 767, capturing the same signal that anyone 35,000 feet lower down could get with a home dish. The test plane called the Spirit of Delta, has everything but a kitchen refrigerator that passengers can raid.</p>
        <p>For now, the signal is piped into projectors that show pictures on the screens that used to show movies, which means that everyone has to watch the same channel.</p>
        <p>''The big joke is, who has the clicker, who has the remote control,'' said John Joe Leach, a spokesman for Delta. In fact, Delta does; on flights under two and a half hours, it has chosen CNN Headline News, and on longer flights, it shows CNN full- length news in the morning, the Discovery Channel in the afternoon and Nick at Night in the evening. ''We inform in morning, educate them in the afternoon and entertain at night, and see which the passengers like more,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Delta is looking for a vendor to put screens on each seat-back and let passengers channel-surf as they cruise through the stratosphere at 300 miles an hour. Delta has not committed itself to installing the antennas on more planes. It also has yet to decide whether the service will be a free perk or paid for by the flight or by the hour (like the television sets that used to be built into seats in airport waiting rooms).</p>
        <p>Industry experts say seat-back screens cost $3,000 to $5,000 each. But Delta believes that the television and laptop outlets could give it a competitive advantage over rival airlines, since they no longer compete on food.</p>
        <p>The antenna, built by Datron Systems Inc., steers itself to stay pointed at a geosynchronous satellite as the airplane banks, turns and moves across North America. The company, based in Escondido, Calif., has sold thousands of simpler antennas for recreational vehicles that will locate a satellite once the vehicle is parked; this fall it began marketing a $6,000 version for R.V.'s, buses, boats and trains that will stay locked on to the satellite even in motion.</p>
        <p>The plane version, which taps into the plane's inertial navigation system to know which way to point, sells for $50,000 to $60,000, according to David A. Derby, Datron's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The Delta system was built in partnership with Hughes Avicom of Pomona, Calif., a unit of the General Motors Corporation. Hughes owns a direct-broadcast television satellite.</p>
        <p>The antenna could handle Web connections, but the television satellites only transmit, so there is no way to send back information, like which link or icon the laptop user has chosen. That reverse flow of data is quite small, though. If the airlines conclude the demand is there, experts say, they might work out a radio link to the ground to complete the two-way circuit.</p>
        <p>''There's no connection on the ground that's not being explored for the airline passenger,'' said Mr. Derby, who predicted that what are now called in-flight entertainment systems will become known as passenger support systems.</p>
        <p>Another connection provided to passengers at their seats on the 'Spirit of Delta'' is electric power. Delta's 767 test plane is experimenting with connections that resemble a cigarette lighter (without the lighter, of course) that deliver 15 volts of direct current. They are meant to accept the adapters that many laptop manufacturers sell for use in a car. John G. Wade, the marketing manager at Olin Aerospace of Redmond, Wash., which builds the power system, said that most cars run at about 14 volts, even if they are referred to as 12-volt systems. A standard household-type alternating current outlet, Mr. Wade said, would pose the risk of an electric shock.</p>
        <p>Olin has sold the system to six airlines in addition to Delta, he said; American, a unit of AMR, will put it on its fleet of A-300 Airbuses in January and the other five have not made announcements yet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wade added that widespread adoption of the system could influence laptop design, since many shoppers now pick a machine with a battery life that is long enough to last a trans-Atlantic or transcontinental flight, and that problem could simply disappear. ''Laptops could get cheaper, lighter and smaller,'' he said, as they are nourished by on-board power supplies.</p>
        <p>The telephones on airplanes have recently sprouted jacks for modem connections. But these are limited to 2,400 baud, fast enough for America Online or Compuserve but not for practical Internet access. The reason is bandwidth; so little radio spectrum is available that a 28,800 modem connection would squeeze out several voice calls, said David M. Paule of Delta, which has installed the jacks on all its GTE and AT&amp;T phones. ''They are getting more and more use,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In the long term, airplanes could communicate with telephone satellites with greater transmission capacity. The Datron antenna can usually focus on one satellite at a time, but the Boeing Company has a smaller model, not yet in commercial service, that is steered electronically and can tune in two satellites at once. Boeing demonstrated its antenna recently on a military plane flying in this country, displaying live video being shot by a drone plane flying in Europe. The Boeing model has no moving parts, saving on maintenance, and is smaller, so it creates less disruption in the air flowing past the plane.</p>
