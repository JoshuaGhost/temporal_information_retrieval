        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your Dec. 15 editorial ''The TV Ratings Wars'' correctly points out that the television industry's resistance to a content-based ratings system stems from its fears that more information on programs ''drives away advertisers and turns off viewers.''</p>
        <p>The paradox is that Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America and chairman of the group devising the television rating system, similarly stonewalled against more information about content in the film rating system on the specious grounds of ''creating confusion,'' but fundamentally for the same reason, that it might turn away customers in that medium, too.</p>
        <p>Even after theater owners insisted upon a Midwest trial run on providing movie rating reasoning in newspapers, on the air and at their box offices, which produced a favorable response, Mr. Valenti continued to oppose going public with such information. Not until 1990 -- 22 years after the present film rating system was adopted -- did Hollywood acknowledge parents' needs and exhibitors' demands, finally empowering the film rating board to supply brief explanations for its R ratings. Two years later, rating reasons were permitted for PG and PG-13 ratings. Now NC-17 is covered as well.</p>
        <p>So far as is known, no one has gone bankrupt because of these rating explanations, parents are better informed and their children better served.</p>
        <p>RICHARD D. HEFFNER  CHARLES CHAMPLIN  New York, Dec. 17, 1996</p>
        <p>The writers are, respectively, the former chairman of the movie rating system and a former arts editor for The Los Angeles Times.</p>
