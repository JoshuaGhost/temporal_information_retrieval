        <p>The Devils shut down the top team in the National Hockey League on Tuesday night. Now comes the difficult task: six games against teams with losing records.</p>
        <p>It sounds strange, but New Jersey usually does well against the league's elite teams and poorly against mediocre squads.</p>
        <p>Coach Jacques Lemaire is hoping that the trend will change on Thursday night when the Calgary Flames (10-15-2) visit Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>The Devils (13-10-1) played effectively in blanking Florida, 2-0, and ending the Panthers' six-game unbeaten streak Tuesday. Lemaire was pleased with Martin Brodeur's performance and with the patience his players showed against a team that uses the same neutral zone trap as the Devils.</p>
        <p>''The thing I liked about the game was that we had control with patience and Martin was good,'' Lemaire said today after practice.</p>
        <p>Although Brodeur had lost three in a row and was miffed at Lemaire's decision not to play him in Colorado on Saturday against Patrick Roy, his boyhood idol, Brodeur came up with a solid performance against the Florida Panthers, making 28 saves.</p>
        <p>Despite turning in his second shutout of the season and 14th of his career, Brodeur is not guaranteed a starting spot against the Flames.</p>
        <p>''I'll decide tomorrow,'' Lemaire said.</p>
        <p>If Lemaire chooses to play Mike Dunham against Calgary, it could erode Brodeur's confidence.</p>
        <p>With Dunham having to play in 25 games in order to avoid becoming a Group 6 free agent after the season, goaltending is becoming a delicate matter for the Devils, and Brodeur may have to pay the price.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Lemaire appeared to be more preoccupied with the big picture rather than the goaltenders after practice.</p>
        <p>''Everyone talks about how close the teams are,'' Lemaire said, ''and we will have to play better against the rest of the teams in the league. I think we will because we have better balance than in the past.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Devils will play host to the Phoenix Coyotes on Friday night. The Coyotes defeated New Jersey last week in overtime. . . . PETR SYKORA (groin) and Steve Thomas (twisted left ankle) will sit out the Calgary game. DAVE ANDREYCHUK (bruised left knee) is expected to play.</p>
