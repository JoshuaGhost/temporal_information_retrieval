        <p>''Personally responsible, individually accountable, find . . . a . . . way.''</p>
        <p>That's the message scrawled on the bulletin board in the Dolphins' locker room this week. Miami (6-7) will play host to the Giants on Sunday at Pro Player Stadium, needing a victory in the worst way to stay alive for a wild-card berth.</p>

        <p>''Personally responsible, individually accountable, find . . . a . . . way.''</p>
        <p>That's the message scrawled on the bulletin board in the Dolphins' locker room this week. Miami (6-7) will play host to the Giants on Sunday at Pro Player Stadium, needing a victory in the worst way to stay alive for a wild-card berth.</p>
        <p>''To even leave the window of opportunity slightly cracked, we can't let this one get away from us,'' cornerback Terrell Buckley said. ''If we lose, you can put curtains on the windows and hang up the Christmas lights.''</p>
        <p>Defensive end Dan Stubbs is mindful that Miami's defensive strength -- stopping the run -- coincides with what the Giants (5-8) like to do.</p>
        <p>''We've got a team that matches up pretty well against them and if we're gonna do anything, we have to do it now,'' Stubbs said. ''Like Coach Johnson said, that doesn't start Sunday at 1 o'clock. It starts today around 2 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>Stubbs expects the Giants' offense to be conservative.</p>
        <p>''I know they're going to run the ball and they've got the offensive line to do it,'' he said. ''I see them wanting to control the ball, because I'm sure they want to keep Dan off the field as much as possible.''</p>
        <p>The Giants rank last in the National Football League in total offense. Dave Brown has thrown 11 touchdown passes and 17 interceptions. Last week, against the Eagles he was 3 of 11 for 31 yards and 2 interceptions.</p>
        <p>Brown said today in a conference call that his exasperation with the offense has prompted him to take uncharacteristic chances.</p>
        <p>''My frustration boils over and I try to make the big play,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Dolphins, in part because they have lost two games in a row, are not taking anything for granted Sunday.</p>
        <p>''I watched them against Dallas and I saw them at the beginning of the year against Buffalo,'' Buckley said. ''Maybe the only thing that's separating them from being a contender is, like us, a couple of players and a couple of plays in a season. I think that's how close the league is now.''</p>
        <p>Stubbs is from Long Branch, N.J., and follows the Giants more closely than his teammates. ''I used to go to Giants games growing up,'' he said. ''So it's always meaningful for me to play against them. Their record might not say what kind of team they are, but when they beat the Cowboys, they made a statement.''</p>
        <p>Stubbs said Johnson, who was described by Buckley today as agitated, told his players in a morning meeting that they had lost some desire.</p>
        <p>''At the beginning of the year, we were so intense,'' Stubbs said. ''He pointed out that he's not seeing that right now. He wants us to focus on ourselves and worry about what we need to do for ourselves.''</p>
