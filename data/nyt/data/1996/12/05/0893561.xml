        <p>FOR children, the library is losing its ''Shhhhhh!''</p>
        <p>And its hard, straight-back chairs.</p>
        <p>And while all fantasies were not realized -- young Shawn Li, for example, was not granted his wish of a skateboard ramp, swimming pool and a slide, instead of elevators and stairs -- at Children's Library here 12-year-old Shawn makes do happily with a heated floor, dozens of striped pillows and cushioned alcoves for comfy lounging in a copper-turreted Storytelling Pavilion reminiscent of ''The Arabian Nights.''</p>
        <p>''It's a really homey place,'' Shawn said.</p>
        <p>The new Denver Children's Library ''is kind of cool,'' seconded Farah Akbar, a fourth grader. The library, which cost more than $2 million and was designed by Michael Graves, with Klipp Colussy Jenks DuBois Architects of Denver, is leading a band of public children's libraries nationwide that are trying to lure a new generation of readers with inspiring homes away from home for savoring language -- both printed and electronic. Among them:</p>
        <p>* The Dallas Public Library's Children's Center, where children are greeted by life-size photos of real kids etched in glass and a miniature castle filled with picture books.</p>
        <p>* San Francisco Public Library's Fisher Children's Center, where children can explore computer graphics, hone their reading or math skills or log on to the Internet in a tower with 56 CD-ROM's and 21 computers.</p>
        <p>* Some libraries in Florida and Louisiana, which are offering coupons to the zoo, skating arenas, fast-food restaurants and movies to children who read a certain number of books during the summer. Thus, even without elaborate building projects, other libraries are looking for novel ways to lure young readers.  Children's librarians say they are racing against the clock to involve children in the world of books.</p>
        <p>Mary Somerville, president of the American Library Association, explained, ''Children can lose several grades of reading skills if they don't read during the summer.''</p>
        <p>While children have always frequented small neighborhood branch libraries, what is new to many cities are the extensive children's services now downtown in the central library.</p>
        <p>''In some urban centers, you didn't even build a children's room because you didn't think children would come,'' Ms. Somerville said. ''Now there is a feeling that if you build it, they will come. Libraries are becoming extremely popular as oases in the middle of the city.''</p>
        <p>But what makes children want to read? When it came time to formulate the new design for the Children's Library in Denver, Pam Sandlian, its manager, and Beth Elder, the collections specialist, asked a novel constituency for their ideas: children 5 to 12, from five diverse Denver neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>One girl wanted a tunnel with a little light, a shelf for her books and a place for her snacks. A contingent wished for cats or rabbits to cuddle up with while they read. A little amusement park, a carousel and ''shorter librarians'' were other design dreams.</p>
        <p>The design team learned three main lessons: First, children want comfort and a space that feels like their own little world. Second, children are hands-on learners who love to move around and are not quiet. Finally, the call numbers for organizing books are not understood by many children, which makes finding a specific book a mystery.</p>
        <p>Since these prospective library users are being raised in a world of theme parks and computer games, libraries can count on competition.</p>
        <p>''We are very aware of computer games, video games,'' Ms. Sandlian said. ''We have to move ourselves out of being a passive place to a place that is very appealing and interactive, that moves kids more than cerebrally.''</p>
        <p>But she cautioned: ''I don't think of the children's library as a play center or entertainment center. I think of libraries as information centers and places where children can discover information.''</p>
        <p>In the main Children's Library in Denver, there are 16 computers with child-friendly software, especially valuable for those who do not have them at home.</p>
        <p>The Denver Central Library was designed in the international style in 1956 by Burnham Hoyt. And because it was designated a historic landmark, Mr. Graves and Klipp Colussy worked to maintain as much of the building as possible. The Children's Library, however, was originally in an annex that could be razed.</p>
        <p>The turret of the Storytelling Pavilion overlooking Denver's Civic Center Park is already a local landmark that beckons to children citywide. Evidence that youngsters are heeding the call: One-third of Denver's library card holders are children. In March 1992, the month that the old 9,000-square-foot children's library closed for renovation, 20,622 children's books were checked out. In October 1996, 43,530 children's books were in circulation.</p>
        <p>Today, there are 12,500 square feet devoted to children's services, with room for the lion's share of the collection's 111,000 books.</p>
        <p>''Everything has kind of doubled,'' Ms. Sandlian said. ''But there can be 200 people in here, and you feel you are off by yourself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Graves said, ''We wanted the place to be so inviting that a child might think, 'I'd rather go to the library than read at home.' '' He added: ''But we never wanted to patronize the children. You don't make something so overtly childlike that it ages quickly. ABC's on the wall age pretty quickly. The Storytelling Pavilion in Denver is grand and luxurious, a space that most kids don't have.''</p>
        <p>And there is a measure of wit about the library's meandering layout. It was suggested by Ms. Sandlian and Ms. Elder and inspired by Winnie-the-Pooh's Wandering Path through 100 Aker Wood, as depicted on the endpapers of A. A. Milne's 1926 classic.</p>
        <p>With its tentlike top in bold pastel stripes, the airy octagonal Storytelling Pavilion is a metaphor, ''creating a place to illustrate the difference between illusion and reality, in much the same way children's literature does,'' said Mr. Graves, whose firm also designed the interiors and furniture. There are even ''shorter librarians'': volunteer Resource Rangers, 11 to 14 years old -- Shawn Li is now one -- approach fellow students and offer help.</p>
        <p>But even 6-year-olds can explore the library's collection by clicking onto the ''Kid's Catalogue'' with pictures as well as words in bright attractive colors. (The navigational system created by Ms. Sandlian and two other Denver librarians, Tom Doerr and Paula Busey, is now widely used in the United States.) On screen, the user is symbolized by a green robot. A printout map points to the right shelf.</p>
        <p>Contributing to Denver's success is its tradition as a city of library users. American Library Association data show that slightly more than 60 percent of Denver's population hold library cards. In 1990, voters approved a $91.6 million bond issue to renovate and update Denver's Central Library and its branches. A private fund drive raised $6.4 million more to buy computers and upgrade furnishings and finishes.</p>
        <p>The Denver Public Library's Friends Foundation, with 4,400 members in a city of 500,000, is second only to the New York Public Library's membership organization.</p>
        <p>''We haven't been well blessed moneywise, compared to some smaller cities or suburbs, to do all that we would like to do,'' said Julie Cummins, coordinator of children's services for New York Public, whose main children's branch, an entire floor at the Donnell Library on West 53d Street, offers only one reading ''roost'' for a child and adult.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cummins said of the New York system, ''We don't have to have gimmicks to entice children.'' She added: ''If we had money, we would buy books with it. We know that our children's libraries are used. The bigger problem is that we don't have all the materials and resources for children once they are here.''</p>
        <p>But striking marketing events have worked well in San Francisco, which spent $137 million for a new library (by Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners, in association with the San Francisco firm Simon Martin-Vegue Winkelstein Moris). On a Sunday last April, following the library's opening, the comedian Robin Williams and his three children were hosts for a family day attended by 20,000 in the new children's library, which is three times larger than the old.</p>
        <p>Since that show-stopper welcome, ''we can't keep the books on the shelves,'' said Linda Geistlinger, manager of the Children's Center.</p>
        <p>When Dallas opened its new J. Erik Jonsson Central Library in 1982, there were just 3,000 square feet for children, tucked away in the humanities division; it was assumed that children would not come downtown to the library. But the 10-story building turned into a magnet for school groups.</p>
        <p>After $350,000 in private funds was raised in a year, the 11,000-square-foot Children's Center opened on the second floor in May 1989. Today, a giant arrow with ''Kids'' in red neon points children to their space and all 110,000 volumes of the children's collection. There is a storytelling ''forest,'' a performance pavilion and an electronic learning center with eight computers.</p>
        <p>And Denver's space is considered exemplary by professionals from around the country. Dick Waters, principal consultant for Providence Associates, library consultants in Denton, Tex., said, ''Denver's Children's Library is clearly one of the more exciting, certainly one of the bigger spaces for children.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''We need to pay attention to their needs and do what we can to make them good citizens, meaningful adults, and still let them be kids. The reality is that school libraries are often dismal, understaffed and have inadequate collections. Children and their parents now expect more from their public libraries.''</p>
        <p>Denver's central library's director, Linda Cumming, said: ''Parents make a child want to go to the library. Then it's up to the library to make the child want to come back.''</p>
        <p>In Denver, making the library fun seems to be working.</p>
        <p>On one sunny Sunday afternoon, a girl with long blond hair and a book in hand escorted her father to an Adirondack-style love seat. ''Let's sit here near the big raccoon,'' she suggested. ''Let's see if you can fit in. Let's squish.''</p>
