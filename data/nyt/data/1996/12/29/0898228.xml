        <p>Bill pending in Legislation would legalize common practice at Jersey Shore of raising money for local fire and first-aid squads by holding out buckets for passing motorists (New Jersey Briefs) (S)</p>

        <p>Almost any summer day, drivers at the Jersey Shore can see volunteers from first-aid squads and fire departments standing along the roadside holding out buckets or stretching sheets for motorists to hit with coins. The gimmick, used elsewhere in the state, is a fund-raising staple. But it's illegal.</p>
        <p>A bill pending in the State Legislature would legalize roadside coin tosses. It has passed the Senate and is out of committee in the Assembly and awaiting a vote by the full house. More than a year ago, it died for lack of Assembly action.</p>
        <p>The bill was introduced by two Republican legislators from Flemington, Senator William Schluter and Assemblyman Leonard Lance, in behalf of the Whitehouse Station Fire Company, which in the early 1990's concentrated its fund raising on a weekend in July when a ballooning festival draws people to nearby Solberg Airport. Then someone associated with the festival complained, and the police in Readington Township, Hunterdon County, began enforcing a state law that forbids any charity to solicit money along a public roadway. Robert W. Karwel, a member of the fire company, declined to say how much the coin toss made, but he acknowledged that the money was a substantial portion of the budget.</p>
        <p>The fire company is hoping the change can be made before next summer's balloon festival. Mr. Karwel said he hoped volunteers from other first aid squads and fire companies would support of the bill.</p>
