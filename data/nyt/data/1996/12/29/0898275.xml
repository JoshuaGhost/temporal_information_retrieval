        <p>Letter from Wayne Pacelle says National Rifle Assn has suffered electoral losses related to gun control issue as well as setbacks in its other principal interest: hunting rights (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Electoral losses related to the gun control issue are just one indicator of the diminishing influence of the National Rifle Association (front page, Dec. 24). The N.R.A. has also sustained repeated setbacks in its other principal interest: hunting rights.</p>
        <p>Voters this year sided with animal advocates, and even some fair-minded sportsmen, over the rifle association in six states that decided statewide ballot initiatives addressing trophy hunting and commercial trapping. In spite of a blitz of N.R.A. advertising, voters outlawed steel-jaw leghold trapping in Colorado and Massachusetts; rejected hound hunting and baiting of bears and other predators in Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington; barred airborne hunting of wolves in Alaska, and maintained a longstanding ban on the trophy hunting of mountain lions in California.</p>

        <p>Voters this year sided with animal advocates, and even some fair-minded sportsmen, over the rifle association in six states that decided statewide ballot initiatives addressing trophy hunting and commercial trapping.

        <p>Between 1972 and 1990, we animal protection advocates did not prevail in a single initiative fight, largely because of the influence of the gun lobby. Since 1990, we have had 10 statewide wins against the gun groups -- a mark not only of our increasing organizational growth but of an atrophying in the N.R.A.'s political muscle.</p>
        <p>WAYNE PACELLE  Vice President, Humane Society  Washington, Dec. 26, 1996</p>
