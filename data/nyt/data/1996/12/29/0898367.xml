        <p>In a pro-gun, pro-hunting state like Idaho, the state's top education official thought she had a winning idea when she proposed adding shooting sports as an extracurricular activity in junior and senior high schools.</p>
        <p>Not in the view of the 14-member board of the Idaho High School Activities Association, to which Anne Fox, the superintendent of public instruction, pitched the idea. The board flatly rejected her suggestion, expressing concerns about liability and safety. Association officials said her proposal would violate a Federal weapons policy that calls for a one-year suspension of students who bring guns to schools.</p>

        <p>In a pro-gun, pro-hunting state like Idaho, the state's top education official thought she had a winning idea when she proposed adding shooting sports as an extracurricular activity in junior and senior high schools.</p>
        <p>Not in the view of the 14-member board of the Idaho High School Activities Association, to which Anne Fox, the superintendent of public instruction, pitched the idea. The board flatly rejected her suggestion, expressing concerns about liability and safety. Association officials said her proposal would violate a Federal weapons policy that calls for a one-year suspension of students who bring guns to schools.</p>
        <p>Don Armstrong, association president in Potlatch, said he thought Dr. Fox's request was ''strange.''</p>
        <p>''I know there are groups that would offer classes in shooting, but it's hard for me to imagine how this would fit into Idaho schools,'' Mr. Armstrong said. ''We're just not interested in putting rifles in schools.''</p>
        <p>Gerald Sweet of Meridian, a two-time past president of the Idaho Rifle and Pistol Association, said he was surprised that the activities association rejected Dr. Fox's proposal.</p>
        <p>''I think they just glossed over her proposal without discussing the safety benefits,'' Mr. Sweet said. ''I mean wait a minute, this is Idaho.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Fox, a Republican who is serving her first four-year term as superintendent, an elected position, said she proposed the idea as a way to instill self-confidence in students, help them focus and teach them about firearms safety. The death on Nov. 18 of a 12-year-old Boise boy who shot himself while playing with a pistol in his basement underscored the need for firearms training in schools, said her spokeswoman, Rhonda Edmiston.</p>
        <p>As a graduate student in Syracuse in the mid-1970's, Dr. Fox knew that it was common for Eastern high schools to have rifle teams, Ms. Edmiston said, and she wondered why a pro-firearms state like Idaho did not have them.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people are afraid to educate kids about guns, but Dr. Fox believes if kids knew how to handle guns, they're more apt to be safe with them,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Most states have competitive shooting teams associated with high schools or junior R.O.T.C. programs, said Margaret J. Schoap, manager of collegiate shooting programs and schools for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va. ''This is not a new idea,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Parents should not confuse competitive shooting with violence in schools, Ms. Schoap said. ''Once school boards have all the facts and see the kind of kid who's involved in competitive shooting versus the kind of kid who brings a gun illegally to school, they'll see that these are two completely different things,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Firearms violations are a growing problem in Idaho public schools, as they are across the nation. In the last two years, 21 aggravated assaults occurred in Idaho public schools, incidents in which children pointed, displayed or fired a gun in school. In addition, there were 54 weapons-law violations, in which teen-agers were caught with guns in school, according to the State Department of Law Enforcement.</p>
        <p>Terry G. Anderson, president of the Idaho Parent-Teacher Association, said Dr. Fox should have talked to education and shooting groups about her proposal before going forward with it.</p>
        <p>''If Fox had built a groundswell of political support for the idea, it would have had a better chance,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''I really believe she means well, but sometimes I'm not sure that she thinks ideas through far enough and long enough before she goes public with them.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Fox is no stranger to dispute. She has rocked the education establishment with proposals to reject Federal financing for Goals 2000, a school-reform program, and School to Work, a program intended to improve work skills for teen-agers. She was overruled by the Idaho Board of Education on both counts.</p>
        <p>In October, Dr. Fox declared that Idaho's 112 school districts would not be eligible for $240,000 in Federal AIDS-education money unless the districts offered abstinence-based sex education, a policy that many local superintendents saw as an infringement on their control.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fox reminds some people of another Idaho Republican, Representative Helen Chenoweth, who has had national media attention for her outspoken conservatism. Like Representative Chenoweth, Dr. Fox counts conservative Republicans, militia groups and Christian groups as her core supporters.</p>
        <p>Dr. Fox may be taking a cue from Representative Chenoweth and playing to that following, said John Freemuth, a political science professor at Boise State University. ''She sounds real ideological, almost like she's catering to a particular clientele,'' Professor Freemuth said. ''Maybe it's a smart move for re-election in two years, as long as this narrow constituency is vocal enough to make a difference.''</p>
