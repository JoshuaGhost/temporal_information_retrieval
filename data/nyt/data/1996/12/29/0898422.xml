        <p>The Japanese Government approved a payment 10 years ago to left-wing guerrillas who threatened the life of its Ambassador in Peru, in an incident similar to the current hostage crisis in Lima, a Japanese newspaper reported today.</p>
        <p>The respected Asahi Shimbun said the Ambassador was sent a letter in 1986 during a party at his residence warning he would be killed unless he paid a ransom. The article did not say who sent the letter, but noted that the rebel organizations active then were the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, the group now holding more than 100 hostages at the Japanese Ambassador's residence, and Shining Path.</p>

        <p>The Foreign Ministry in Tokyo ordered the embassy to take $150,000 to a Lima park as demanded, but nobody collected it, the article said.</p>
        <p>The ministry did not comment on the report's overall accuracy, but denied a threat was delivered at a 1986 party, Kyodo News Service said.</p>
