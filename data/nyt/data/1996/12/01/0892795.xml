        <p>TALES FROM WATERSHIP DOWN</p>
        <p>By Richard Adams.</p>
        <p>Knopf, $23.</p>
        <p>Imagine blending the works of Beatrix Potter and Joseph Campbell and you get a pretty fair picture of the content and tone of Richard Adams's imaginative novel ''Watership Down,'' which chronicles the eventful journey of a ragtag band of talking rabbits led by Hazel, the four-legged Moses who guides his followers away from their doomed burrow. In this sequel, Mr. Adams looks in on the lives of the Watership warren a few months after the climactic battle with the evil rabbit General Woundwort that concluded the first book. More a loose collection of short stories than an epic narrative, ''Tales From Watership Down'' is divided into three sections. The first two focus primarily on the rabbits' leisure-time retelling of the various mythic exploits of their folk-hero, El-ahrairah, and his faithful sidekick, Rabscuttle. The third section returns to the present-day doings of Hazel and his companions. But while all this works well as a lighthearted companion piece to the original novel, it's a little disjointed as a stand-alone volume. Although it's grand to see Mr. Adams's characters again, he doesn't reveal anything particularly new about these familiar personalities, with one exception: the female rabbits, mere plot elements in the first book, are developed here as well-defined individuals. In a nice 90's touch, the doe Hyzenthlay rises to the rank of Co-Chief Rabbit beside Hazel, and even gets her own brief solo adventure.</p>
