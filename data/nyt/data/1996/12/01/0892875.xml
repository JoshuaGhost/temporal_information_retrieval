        <p>FIVE years ago, with New Rochelle in a budget crunch, subscriptions to every magazine in the public library were threatened with cancellation. But a resident's idea, which was embraced by many others, saved the periodical collection.</p>
        <p>The idea, Adopt-a-Magazine, worked so well that it is no longer needed, and a retirement celebration will be held at the library next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Taking a page from community efforts to maintain stretches of highway or vest-pocket parks by symbolically adopting them, Rob Seitz, the resident whose idea started the program, suggested that the library start a campaign to encourage people to underwrite the costs of the magazines.</p>
        <p>''It was his idea; he was just a member of the public, a concerned citizen,'' said Patricia Anderson, director of the library, which serves a city of almost 70,000 people. ''We had great success with it.''</p>
        <p>At the time of the budget shortfall, Mr. Seitz was president of the Glenwood Lake Neighborhood Association, an organization of 250 households on the west side of the city on the Pelham border where he lives.</p>
        <p>He took his idea to the library's board of trustees. Facing a zero budget for such materials as magazines, the board gave its approval.</p>
        <p>''I said I would help publicize it on a pro bono basis,'' said Mr. Seitz, a public relations consultant who in 1993 accepted an invitation to join the library board. ''We wrote a check for $50, double the next year, and issued a challenge to all other neighborhood associations and concerned residents to do the same.</p>
        <p>''My whole modus operandi was to make Glenwood Lake and its residents as involved with the day-to-day activities of the city as possible. It's a real microcosm of what New Rochelle is all about -- racially and ethnically mixed, like a miniature United Nations.'' Mr. Seitz also promoted a vain letter campaign to bring the Unicef headquarters to his city.</p>
        <p>Of the magazine effort, Mr. Seitz said: ''Every year since we began it has been a self-driven fund-raising campaign. We didn't have to have an aggressive outreach. We just kept posting thanks to all who donated.'' Contributions came from 300 people.</p>
        <p>He added that the campaign also fulfilled a self-interest. ''As a P.R. man and freelance writer, I relied on the library collection myself.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Anderson said the campaign saved 425 titles. The library now maintains 210 magazine subscriptions, costing almost $8,000, but it also has 1,000 periodicals on line on computers. The library has about 200,000 volumes and a collection of 400,000 photographs and magazine clippings.</p>
        <p>The proposed 1997 general budget is about $2.2 million with emphasis on two areas: children's services and improvements to the library's technology.</p>
        <p>''What is really important to stress, is that people were there when we really, really needed them,'' Mrs. Anderson said. ''Now that the city and library are better off we are extremely grateful.''</p>
        <p>The gratitude will be shown with a free panel discussion and reception featuring editors from some of the library's most frequently asked-for magazines discussing their professional experiences, offering behind-the-scenes glimpses of how magazines arrive at decisions about articles and what magazines are doing to compete with the Internet.</p>
        <p>The roster of editors includes Mary Kuntz, editor of marketing news for Business Week; Walter L. Updegrave, associate editor of Money; Julia Kagan, editor of Consumer Reports, and John Rennie, editor in  chief of Scientific American.</p>
        <p>The event will be held in the library's community theater next Sunday at 3 P.M. at 1 Library Plaza near the Metro-North Station in downtown New Rochelle. Seating is limited, and  the library suggests reservations be made by calling 632-7878.</p>
