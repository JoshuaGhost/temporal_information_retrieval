        <p>In a move that could signal a swift end to the candidacy of Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term as United Nations Secretary General, Africans have been released from their pledge to stand behind him in the face of American opposition and are now free to nominate other Africans in order to save the seat for that region.</p>
        <p>In a letter dated Nov. 29 and made public today, Paul Biya, President of Cameroon and the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity,  said that it was a matter of urgency that Africans add to their list of candidates.</p>
        <p>He told heads of Government to make their nominees known to the Security Council. By informal rotation, each region holds the position of Secretary General for two consecutive terms.</p>
        <p>''The logjam is broken,'' said Madeleine K. Albright, the chief United States delegate. ''We need a Secretary General by the end of the year,'' she said in an interview. ''The process has to be kept on track and President Biya's letter is a very important step forward.''</p>
        <p>Paolo Fulci, Italy's representative and this month's Security Council President, said recently that he hoped a decision can be reached before the Dec. 17 adjournment of the  General Assembly, which formally elects a Secretary General on the Council's advice. Mr. Boutros-Ghali's term ends on Dec. 31.</p>
        <p>Half a dozen or more Africans are considered potential candidates, with countries prepared to back them. The United States has said it will give priority to Africans, who say it is their region's turn, but Washington has also said it will not wait forever before turning to other regions.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the Clinton Administration vetoed Mr. Boutros-Ghali in the first Security Council vote on the issue, but the Secretary General, an Egyptian, along with his African and Arab supporters, refused to concede.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boutros-Ghali remains in the race until either he withdraws or is moved aside by another nominee who is approved unanimously by the Security Council's permanent members: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. The United States exercised its veto to prevent Mr. Boutros-Ghali from serving a second term.</p>
        <p>Some friends and advisers of Mr. Boutros-Ghali are urging him to withdraw now while he still has the formal backing of 14 of the 15 Security Council members.</p>
        <p>''The preservation of his dignity is essential to the effectiveness of a future Secretary General,'' said Clovis Maksoud, a former Arab League envoy at the United Nations who now directs the Center for the Global South at American University in Washington. ''He should act as the elder statesman at this moment when the United Nations needs his intellectual input.''</p>
        <p>The Secretary General does not want to face another veto, aides say.</p>
        <p>Ruth Wedgwood, an expert on the United Nations at the Yale Law School and the Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview that  the Secretary General should not prolong a confrontation with Washington, but should find other ways to serve in international relations. ''To be effective, a Secretary General requires a good working relationship with the five permanent members of the Security Council,'' she said.</p>
        <p>With the African bloc now free to produce other names, the focus of attention is shifting to the French, who supported Mr. Boutros-Ghali but insisted that if he goes, any new Secretary General must be a francophone, something they define as more than just French-speaking. Mr. Boutros-Ghali was educated in Paris.</p>
        <p>By the end of last week, the efforts of France and other European nations to get President Clinton to reconsider and agree to an extension of the Secretary General's term for perhaps two years seemed doomed. No replies have been received by several Government leaders who wrote to Mr. Clinton after his election victory asking him if the subject could be reopened.</p>
        <p>Moreover, at a closed Security Council session last Friday, Ms. Albright told members again that there could be no compromise. The Clinton Administration says that there is no hope of getting a conservative Congress to support the United Nations with Mr. Boutros-Ghali as its top official because, rightly or wrongly, he is perceived to have been too slow at reforming the organization.</p>
        <p>Critics of the United States here say that it may be hard to find anyone on the unofficial list of African candidates who would be a better administrator than Mr. Boutros-Ghali. But most Security Council members say that there is nothing they can do to stop the United States.</p>
        <p>American diplomats will not suggest another candidate or discuss their list of potential nominees. In coming days, nations will have to play a very careful game of judging each other's next moves to protect candidates they may favor while trying to sideline those they do not -- all without publicly disclosing preferences.</p>
        <p>Among many diplomats and officials at the United Nations, Kofi Annan, a Ghanaian and the Under Secretary General in charge of peacekeeping operations, is viewed persistently as the ''American'' candidate.</p>
        <p>However, another name has begun creeping repeatedly into discussions: Olara A. Otunnu, a Ugandan-born diplomat who is president of the International Peace Academy, an independent nonprofit organization in New York devoted conflict resolution. Mr. Otunnu is respected by both Democrats and Republicans interested in foreign affairs.</p>
        <p>''He is a consummate diplomat  and he would make an excellent Secretary General,'' said Rita E. Hauser, an international lawyer who is chairman of the Peace Academy board.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Otunnu, a former Ugandan envoy who went into exile when  Yoweri Museveni took power in 1986, became a citizen of the Ivory Coast,  which already has an unannounced but obviously active candidate, Foreign Minister Amara Essy.</p>
        <p>Among the others are Hamid Algabid of Niger, secretary general of the Islamic conference organization; Salim A. Salim of Tanzania, secretary general of the Organization of African Unity, and Foreign Minister Moustapha Niasse of Senegal.</p>
