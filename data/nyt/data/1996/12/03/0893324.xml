        <p>They looked like Airborne Express deliverymen and they were even driving one of the company's trucks. But as soon as they had delivered their heavy package to a Brooklyn car repair shop, the two men arrested the worker who had signed for it.</p>
        <p>These were no deliverymen, and the package was no ordinary delivery. The men were undercover police officers assigned to an effort against drugs in Brooklyn, and the police said that the package, which they had intercepted, was an air compressor stuffed with 75 pounds of marijuana, worth thousands of dollars.</p>
        <p>The man they arrested was Albert Malcolm, 32, of 1964 Bussing Avenue in the Wakefield section of the Bronx. The police said that the repair shop, on Utica Avenue in East Flatbush, was not a target of the inquiry.</p>
        <p>''We delivered it to the site, and once he signed for it, we locked him up,'' said Officer Joseph Butta, one of five police officers backing up the two in the truck. ''He was kind of surprised.''</p>
        <p>The police first received a tip on Saturday that a drug delivery was planned, said a senior Brooklyn police official who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''We got information that this thing contained drugs, so we tested and confirmed it and then got a warrant,'' the official said. ''Then we did a controlled delivery.''</p>
        <p>Law enforcement agencies have complained for years about drug dealers' using overnight package delivery services as their unwitting couriers. And while many delivery services have stepped up their security and screening procedures, drugs still occasionally get through.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Airborne Express, who was unfamiliar with the details of the case, said that his company did all it could to avoid transporting drugs. Sometimes, smugglers find new ways to disguise their drugs. This time it didn't work.</p>
        <p>''It was packed in a Sears Craftsman air compressor,'' Officer Butta said. ''A lot of it.''</p>
