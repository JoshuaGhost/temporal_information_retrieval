        <p>In the course of the Bosnia war, it became axiomatic that the various governments in the region made promises on which they quickly reneged.</p>
        <p>So, when Yugoslavia, in the course of negotiating an arms control treaty that was signed in June, promised to destroy 80 tanks before the end of this year, few expected it to happen.</p>
        <p>But it turns out that Yugoslavia has gone beyond its promise, destroying 240 of its tanks, according to European diplomats and military officials who reviewed compliance with the treaty this week.</p>
        <p>At the same time, these officials said, the Clinton Administration, which promised Yugoslavia $2 million to help with the demolition program, is delaying the payments. Based on what Belgrade has done to date, the officials said, Washington owes Yugoslavia about $1 million.</p>
        <p>The reluctance of the United States to make good on its offer -- issued when the treaty was being negotiated -- is understood by European diplomats to arise out Washington's unhappiness with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. Mr. Milosevic's harsh reaction to protests against his decision to annul the results of elections last month has been condemned by Washington.</p>
        <p>The American mission to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which oversees the treaty, declined to comment on the failure of the United States to make the payments to Yugoslavia.</p>
        <p>While Yugoslavia has more than met its obligations under the arms control accords, the Bosnian Serbs have not, diplomats and military officers said.</p>
        <p>Officials said the Bosnian Serbs are trying to keep twice the number of tanks and 50 percent more heavy artillery pieces than they are permitted under the accord. Altogether, the Bosnian Serbs are trying to protect some 1,200 tanks and artillery pieces from destruction.</p>
        <p>As well as tanks and artillery, the treaty places ceilings on the number of armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft and attack helicopters that may be possessed by Yugoslavia, Croatia, the Muslim-Croat Federation in Bosnia and the Bosnian Serb republic.</p>
        <p>Each Government was required to report the number of weapons it had at the time and to begin destroying its excess. They were, for example, to have destroyed 40 percent of the artillery and 20 percent of the tanks above what the treaty allowed by the end of this month.</p>
        <p>The Muslim-Croat Federation is behind in meeting its obligations because of a dispute between the Muslims and Croats over which of their armies has to turn over the weapons to be destroyed.</p>
        <p>The greatest concern, however, is focused on the Bosnian Serbs.</p>
        <p>To begin with, they underreported the number of weapons in their arsenal when the war ended. The Bosnian Serbs said, for example, they had 1,348 pieces of heavy artillery, according to a report prepared by the security organization. But NATO intelligence concluded they had between 2,200 and 2,950.</p>
        <p>More troubling to the officials monitoring the treaty is the manner in which the Bosnian Serbs have interpreted treaty provisions that allow the parties to exempt from destruction those weapons that are intended for export, are used in research and development, or will be placed in museums.</p>
        <p>The Bosnian Serbs assert that 338 of their tanks and 800 of their heavy artillery fall within those exemptions. If allowed to stand, that would leave the Bosnian Serbs with 475 tanks, instead of the 137 ceiling set by the treaty.</p>
