        <p>MEN'S BASKETBALL</p>
        <p>Fortson Paces Bearcats</p>
        <p>Danny Fortson returned from a foul-induced benching and scored 23 points in the second half last night, rallying No. 7 Cincinnati to a 102-79 victory over previously unbeaten Eastern Michigan.</p>
        <p>Fortson sank 14 of 15 shots over all, a school record for accuracy, and scored a season-high 33 points on an assortment of dunks, layups and jump shots. He also had a team-high 11 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Fortson scored the game's first 7 points but went to the bench a few minutes later with two fouls, allowing Eastern Michigan (6-1) to pull ahead by 6 points in his absence.</p>
        <p>Fortson started the second half and helped Cincinnati (4-2) turn a close game into a decisive victory. The 6-foot-7-inch power forward scored 17 points in an opening 30-18 run that pushed the lead to 14 points.</p>
        <p>The loss ended a sizzling start by Eastern Michigan, which has opened the last two seasons with long unbeaten streaks. The Eagles began last year 7-0, won the Mid-American Conference championship, reached the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament for the third time in school history and upset Duke in the first round. They beat Old Dominion and Syracuse last weekend to win the Carrier Classic and run their record to 6-0. (AP)</p>
        <p>PRINCETON 73, LEHIGH 42: Princeton destroyed an injury-plagued Lehigh squad, taking a 43-2 lead in the first half. The Tigers, playing at home, tore to a 26-0 lead in the first 11 minutes, before a layup by Engineers guard Sean Tuohey closed the gap to 26-2.</p>
        <p>Princeton (5-2) responded with 17 unanswered points over the next seven minutes, capping an 18-minute run that catapulted the Tigers to a 41-point lead.</p>
        <p>Lehigh (0-7) finished the half with a run of its own, outscoring the Tigers by 6-2 in the final minutes to close the gap to 45-8. (AP)</p>

        <p>Alabama Triumphs</p>
        <p>Dominique Canty had 16 points and 13 rebounds as No. 7 Alabama beat No. 9 Penn State, 68-47, yesterday in the second round of the Holiday Beach Classic at Myrtle Beach, S.C.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 1 point at halftime, Alabama (6-2) started the second half with a 22-4 run to take a 49-32 lead with just under eight minutes left.</p>
        <p>The reserve Tausha Mills had 11 points, 6 rebounds and 5 blocks in only 16 minutes for Alabama. Shauntai Hall paced Penn State (7-1) with 12 points and 7 rebounds. (AP)</p>
        <p>GEORGIA 72, WEBER STATE 44: Tracy Henderson scored 14 points and No. 3 Georgia forced 30 turnovers in a victory over Weber State in the opening round of the Northern Light Invitational in Anchorage.

        <p>Still Blue in St. Louis</p>
        <p>Mario Lemieux made it a miserable night for the St. Louis Blues' new regime, scoring three goals Thursday in the visiting Pittsburgh Penguins' 4-0 victory. The Blues fired their general manager and coach, Mike Keenan, and their team president, Jack Quinn, earlier in the day. The moves had no initial effect as the Blues, under the interim coach Jimmy Roberts, lost their fourth straight over all and franchise-record sixth in a row at home.</p>
        <p>Jaromir Jagr assisted on all four Penguins goals, helping Lemieux get his 26th career hat trick. Lemieux also had an assist. (AP)</p>
        <p>SENATORS 5, PANTHERS 2: Aleksei Yashin capped a four-goal burst in a 10-minute span of the second period as Ottawa beat Florida to end a six-game home losing streak. (AP)</p>

Contintentalvictory, winner of the Hambletonian, the World Trotting Derby and the Yonkers Trot, became the eighth female horse in 50 years of balloting to capture the award.</p>
