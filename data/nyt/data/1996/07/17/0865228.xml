        <p>The economy remained healthy and balanced last month, displaying solid gains  in industrial production and no signs of surging inflation, the Government reported today.</p>
        <p>The benign data -- contained in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index and the Federal Reserve's industrial output survey -- provided a calming counterpoint on Wall Street to the rash of lower-than-expected corporate earnings announcements that helped to send stock prices gyrating.</p>
        <p>The reports were characterized by the Clinton Administration as further evidence that the economy was performing as well as it had in decades, with steady growth and low inflation. And while economists predicted that the pace of growth would slow as the year progressed, they said the economy remained nearly  free of the kinds of bottlenecks that could derail the expansion.</p>
        <p>"What could be better than an economy that is growing at a relatively fast clip, with lots of jobs being created, yet with very little in the way of inflationary consequences?" said Edward Yardeni, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Lawrence Inc.</p>
        <p>Today's news did not totally dampen speculation that the Federal Reserve would push interest rates up later this summer to forestall the possibility of a wage and price spiral farther down the road. The Fed is expected to scrutinize a number of economic indicators at the end of this month and early next month, including employment costs and job growth, before deciding whether a rate increase is warranted.</p>
        <p>Today's reports, said Joel L. Naroff, an economist at the First Union Bank in Philadelphia, provided "not a whiff of rising inflation."</p>
        <p>The Labor Department reported that the Consumer Price Index inched up one-tenth of 1 percent in June, slightly below the expectations of most economists and down from its increase of three-tenths of a percent in May. For the last 12 months, inflation at the consumer level rose 2.8 percent, roughly consistent with its trend of the last several years.</p>
        <p>Excluding its most volatile components, food and energy, the inflation index  was up two-tenths of a percent last month and at a 2.7 percent annual pace for the last 12 months.</p>
        <p>The report showed that energy prices, which had shot up this spring, fell 2.2 percent in June. Included in the energy price drop was a 3.2 percent decline in  gasoline prices, whose rise earlier this year prompted a frenzied election-year  political response, including a Republican proposal to rescind the 4.3-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax and an effort by the Clinton Administration to nudge down oil prices by selling some of the nation's petroleum reserves. At the same time, food prices shot up seven-tenths of a percent during the month, with meat, poultry, dairy and produce prices all sharply higher.</p>
        <p>Inflation would normally be expected to increase when the economy is growing  at a strong rate and the unemployment rate is low, since companies would normally try to pass on the resultant rise in wage rates to consumers in the form of higher prices. But the June inflation numbers were muted despite a strong rise in industrial production at a time when the unemployment, at 5.3 percent, was at a six-year low.</p>
        <p>The Federal Reserve said industrial production increased five-tenths of a percent in June, somewhat higher than most projections. At the same time, however, the Fed revised its estimate of industrial production in May down to five-tenths of a percent from seven-tenths.</p>
        <p>While industrial production continued to grow at a strong clip in June, it did not appear to strain the ability of factories, mines and utilities to keep up with demand. The Fed reported that the capacity utilization for the month stood at 83.2 percent of potential output, still below the 85 percent that most  economists believe signals potential inflationary bottlenecks.</p>
        <p>The Labor Department reported that real average weekly earnings rose 2.2 percent from May to June. The increase was caused by what the Bureau of Labor Statistics said was an "unusual combination" of a 1.5 percent increase in hours  worked and an increase of eight-tenths of a percent in average hourly earnings.</p>
        <p>Economists and traders are now turning their attention to testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, on Thursday before the Senate Banking  Committee.</p>
        <p>In particular, they will be looking for clues as to how the Fed is resolving  the debate over whether the economy is more capable of sustaining noninflationary growth than previous rules of thumb suggested. Not only have economists been forced to rethink their assumptions about the relationship between unemployment and inflation, they have also had to question whether rapid changes in technology and business practices have left them unable to measure improvements in such key gauges as productivity and capacity.</p>
        <p>Wall Street will also be looking for signals that the Fed, after the volatility of the last few days on Wall Street, may be concerned about a sharp downturn in the stock market and its effect on the broader economy and on monetary policy. A steep downturn in the market could leave individual investors feeling poorer and cause them to rein in their spending. A crash in prices could force the Fed to keep monetary policy looser than it might otherwise, as it did during and after the market tailspin in October 1987, to insure adequate liquidity.</p>
        <p>At the same time, analysts will be watching for any indication that the Fed is willing to hold its fire on inflation this year, at a time when the economy seems to be humming along, and save its ammunition for the next cyclical downturn or upward spike in inflation.</p>
        <p>Since The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that two Fed economists conducted a mathematical review of that approach, known as "opportunistic disinflation," some analysts concluded that the Fed was sending a signal that it would not raise rates this summer.</p>
        <p>But other economists said the "opportunistic disinflation" approach was by no means new, and indeed was the signature of Mr. Greenspan's nine-year tenure at the central bank. In Congressional testimony in February, Mr. Greenspan said "keeping inflation from rising significantly during economic expansions will permit a gradual ratcheting down of inflation over the course of successive business cycles" -- a formulation that implied that progress on inflation during downturns.</p>
