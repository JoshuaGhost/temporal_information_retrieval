        <p>The British engineering company Rolls-Royce P.L.C. said yesterday that it would leave the steam power generation business, putting two companies up for sale and warning of up to L170 million ($263 million) in charges. The company's  money-losing business, which designs and builds steam turbines, has 2,500 employees in two companies: Parsons Power Generation Systems and International Combustion. Rolls-Royce said it hoped to find a buyer by the end of 1997. The charges would be taken in the second half of this year.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Rolls-Royce's steam power generation business lost L11 million ($17 million) despite revenues of L280 million ($433 million). Rolls said it now planned to concentrate on high-technology engineering.</p>
