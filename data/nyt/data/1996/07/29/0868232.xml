        <p>Leftist prisoners abandoned their 69-day-old hunger strike today under a deal that provided the strikers and the new Islamic-led Government with the grist for claims of victory.</p>
        <p>Twelve prisoners have died, and doctors said others, weakened by their long fast, remained in danger.</p>
        <p>The protesters, mostly young people accused of belonging to outlawed leftist organizations, won a major demand: the removal of 102 fellow prisoners from a feared high-security prison in central Anatolia and a commitment by the Government that no more prisoners would be transferred there.</p>
        <p>The month-old Government of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, under pressure  from European allies and from many people in Turkey shocked by hunger strikers'  deaths, was able to assert that it had acted in accordance with Islamic principles of mercy, retreating from an earlier threat to break the strike with  a violent storming of the prisons.</p>
        <p>"We could not let a small issue prevent an agreement on this holy night," Justice Minister Sevket Kazan said, referring to the Muslim celebration of the birthday of the prophet Mohammed. Until Saturday, Mr. Kazan had been saying there would be no concessions.</p>
        <p>About 300 people at 43 jails for political prisoners were on what they termed a "death fast," said Sedat Ergin, a leading newspaper commentator in Ankara, and the protest became "a direct challenge" to Prime Minister Erbakan.</p>
        <p>The strike, which had began before Mr. Erbakan's Islamic-led coalition came to power, presented him with a first major crisis.</p>
        <p>While few Turks express sympathy for militant leftists accused of a range of  offenses from the propagation of hard-line Marxist views to murder, the spectacle of weeping mothers denied access to dying sons prompted many to question why the Government was allowing the deaths to continue.</p>
        <p>France, Germany, Italy and the European Union all pressed Ankara to meet the  hunger strikers' demands so as to prevent a further staining of Turkey's human rights record, already tainted by accusations of torture and police brutality.</p>
        <p>"The hunger strikes at Turkey's prisons are over," said Mukadder Basegmez, an Istanbul legislator, after hours of negotiations involving prominent leftist figures like the author Yasar Kemal and the singer Zulfu Livaneli.</p>
        <p>The negotiations were held at Bayrampasa prison in Istanbul, where 900 inmates were regarded by the authorities as the main organizers of the hunger strike supported by some 2,000 leftist political prisoners across the country. Another 4,000 prisoners held on charges of supporting Kurdish separatism joined  the strike in recent days.</p>
        <p>In addition, leftist protesters rioted in various Turkish cities. And the protest spilled far beyond the country's borders, with sympathizers firebombing  Turkish-owned properties in Germany, which is home to two million Turks and Ankara's principal European ally.</p>
        <p>Even with the strike's end, Turkish physicians said as many as 100 of the protesters might still die, or at least suffer severe damage to internal organs, from subsisting for more than two months on nothing more than sweetened water.</p>
        <p>Ambulances and medical teams moved into the Bayrampasa prison early today to  take hunger strikers to hospitals for intravenous feeding.</p>
        <p>Not all of the strikers' demands were met. For instance, Justice Minister Kazan said there was "no question" of shutting down the Eskisehir prison in central Anatolia that was at the core of the dispute.</p>
        <p>The strike started with a decree by the previous Government in May ordering the transfer of prisoners from jails like Bayrampasa -- where they are housed in huge communal wards -- to Eskisehir, a relatively modern prison where inmates are held in small cells.</p>
        <p>The authorities said the move was intended to break up organized leftist groups that thrived in the large communal wards of Bayrampasa, turning the wards into areas off limits to prison guards where inmates ran their own affairs with  smuggled cellular phones, fax machines and even weapons.</p>
        <p>But prisoners' lawyers and human rights activists said that by moving the prisoners far from the site of their trials in Istanbul, the authorities were denying them contact with legal representatives and families and hindering the process of justice.</p>
        <p>Human rights workers say prisoners have nicknamed Eskisehir prison "the coffin" because of its small cells. Under the deal, officials said, 102 prisoners will be moved out of Eskisehir to other jails in or near Istanbul -- but not to Bayrampasa.</p>
        <p>"The prisoners will now be able to say that with their resolve they forced the Government to climb down," said Mr. Ergin, the Ankara commentator, "but the  Government will be able to say it showed flexibility with a problem not of its own making."</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan's Government made some concessions to the strikers when it took office, but that did not mollify the protesters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ergin said the leftist protesters had "driven the Government into a corner," leaving it exposed to accusations of a callous indifference to suffering that damaged its prestige. Turkey's Western allies, including the United States, have been watching closely to see whether Mr. Erbakan, once in power in this NATO country, would prove to be more flexible than his campaign speeches suggested.</p>
        <p>By giving the floor to leftist negotiators opposed to Islamic rule, the Islamic-led Government displayed a pragmatism that suggested that its notion of  Islamic governance was less doctrinaire than some secular Turks had feared.</p>
        <p>Justice Minister Kazan said the authorities had also agreed to end the abusive treatment of prisoners, improve access to medical care and stop dispersing prisoners far from the location of their trials.</p>
        <p>The agreement reflected the decades-old low-level war between the Turkish authorities and leftist militants that has pitted the often brutal power of the  state against adversaries who, as the hunger strike showed, have proved themselves skilled in striking at Ankara's Achilles' heel -- its human rights record.</p>
        <p>But the deal only temporarily shifted attention from Ankara's far broader problem -- the 12-year-old war in the southeast against Kurdish separatists.</p>
        <p>Almost unnoticed in the debate over the hunger strike, the authorities announced that in the latest fighting in the southeast, 28 Kurdish guerrillas and 16 soldiers had been killed, bringing to around 1,000 the number of separatists the army says it has killed since its latest offensive began in April.</p>
