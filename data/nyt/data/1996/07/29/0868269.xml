        <p>Now we know what a beach volleyball star wears to an Olympic medal ceremony:  a red, white and blue warm-up suit, a pink cap and bare feet.</p>
        <p>Karch Kiraly stood on the podium again today, only this time there were flecks of sand clinging to his toes and eight more years of digs, spikes, cuts and sets clinging to his memory as he stared at the American flag rising before  him.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, it could have been Los Angeles or Seoul. There in the stands was  his family, including his lean and proud father, Las, the Hungarian immigrant who tearfully waved the flag of his adopted nation. There around Kiraly's neck was a third Olympic gold medal: the most ever won by a men's volleyball player.</p>
        <p>Kiraly's first two golds came indoors in 1984 and 1988, when he helped lead the American team to the top of a sport long dominated by Eastern Europeans. Today's gold came with his partner, Kent Steffes, on the beach, or, to be more accurate, a rain-swept, sand-filled pit laid down next to an artificial lake in  suburban Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The nearest real beach was more than a three-hour drive away in Savannah, but that was somehow appropriate because professional beach volleyball has proved resolutely flexible in its sun-block-slathered push to prominence.</p>
        <p>Tournaments have been played in landlocked states; they have been played in the dead of winter in arenas in Paris. And now for the first time, the sport's practitioners can say they have played in the Olympics.</p>
        <p>"This was an awesome feeling," Kiraly said. "What I am most proud of is that  I was able to win gold medals in both forms of volleyball."</p>
        <p>Kiraly, 35, and Steffes, 28, were never in serious danger of losing to their  fellow Californians Michael Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh. Before the match, none of them could remember precisely how many times they had met, but all agreed that Kiraly and Steffes had won a large majority of the matches. And when today's 12-5, 12-8 victory ended with Steffes blocking Whitmarsh, there was no surprise, no rancor.</p>
        <p>"What can you say?" Dodd asked. "Losing to Karch Kiraly is nothing to go home ashamed about."</p>
        <p>Steffes also played a vital role with his big jump-serving, big hitting and sparkling defense, and it was defense that made the difference after Dodd and Whitmarsh evened the second set at 5-5. Kiraly and Steffes would end up winning  the next 4 points, the most memorable coming at 8-5 when Kiraly managed to get a piece of a Whitmarsh spike with his left arm. The ball sailed beyond the end line. Steffes lunged and threw up a desperation, long-range underhand set that turned out to be perfectly placed. Kiraly smashed it away for perhaps the easiest of his 17 kills.</p>
        <p>There was more to this match than athleticism, however. It was also charged with symbolism. Despite being a relatively new sport, beach volleyball already has two competing tours: the A.V.P. (Association of Volleyball Professionals), based in the United States; and the F.I.V.B. tour run by the sport's international governing body, which is based in Lausanne, Switzerland.</p>
        <p>Kiraly and Steffes, like Dodd and Whitmarsh, play on the A.V.P. tour. But the F.I.V.B. set the rules and format for the Olympics, and its president, Ruben Acosta, mandated that only two of the three American teams could be chosen at the Olympic trials. The other representative would be the top-ranked American team on the F.I.V.B. tour, which turned out to be Carl Henkel and the 39-year-old Sinjin Smith, a former beach legend no longer at his peak.</p>
        <p>This did not sit well with the A.V.P. tour, where nearly all the top Americans earn an increasingly good living. Nor did the fact that the ball, court dimensions and setting rules chosen for the Olympics all differed from A.V.P. norms. With Kiraly acting as a spokesman, there were threats of a boycott of the trials, but those threats never materialized. And after Kiraly and Steffes barely beat Smith and Henkel in the fourth round here, the all-American  Olympic final turned out to be an all-A.V.P. final, as well.</p>
        <p>Acosta was still on hand to shake hands with the winners and runners-up at the medal ceremony.</p>
        <p>"This was a chance to show that we have the best players in the world as we have said all along," Kiraly said.</p>
        <p>It was also significant that Kiraly's 61-year-old father, Las, was in Jonesboro to see it. Because of his anger with the F.I.V.B.'s rules, Las had refused to come to the Olympics. But on Saturday afternoon, after Kiraly and Steffes advanced to the final, Kiraly called Las at home in Santa Barbara, Calif., and told him he had booked a seat for him on the red-eye to Atlanta. He  also told him explicitly that he wanted him to come.</p>
        <p>"That was the first time he ever had done that," Las Kiraly said.</p>
        <p>It was Las who had introduced his son to volleyball at age 6 on a beach in Santa Barbara and then proudly watched him develop into both the premier player  in the sport and an articulate spokesman for it.</p>
        <p>"The beach game was Karch's first love," Las said. "He played it until he was 14 and then left for all those years to play indoors. This gold medal brings him full circle."</p>
