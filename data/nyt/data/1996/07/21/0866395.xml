        <p>WHILE standing on a train platform one Sunday night after visiting his sister in Fairfield, Charlie Bell, then 24, started thinking about the ride back to his Manhattan apartment and the Monday morning subway commute to his job selling computers for International Business Machines. And then he said to himself, "I don't want to go to work tomorrow."</p>
        <p>Thus began Mr. Bell's great adventure: Running and walking 10,000 miles around the perimeter of America, to California and back. That experience has led to a 1,000-page manuscript that Mr. Bell is trying to have published and a series of descriptive commentaries being broadcast on all three stations of Connecticut Public Radio.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell, now 42 and living in the Lakeville section of Salisbury, sat in his small country house recently and reflected on the "moment of clarity" that struck him that long ago Sunday night in March 1978. "The idea came to me in a high-speed but logical way," he said. "I asked myself, 'What would I like to do?' I wanted to see the United States and I had a fantasy about qualifying for  the Olympics as a marathon runner. I thought about running a big loop, following the seasons. It all seemed to make perfect sense."</p>
        <p>Many people fantasize about quitting their jobs to follow their dreams, of course. But why did Mr. Bell actually do it? "I have a romantic streak," he said. "I knew if I didn't go through with it, for the rest of my life I'd wonder why I hadn't."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell was not so impetuous that he left I.B.M. on that Monday morning after he got his big idea. He spent the following year and a half planning the route and training for his longest marathon by running with a 25-pound backpack. Finally, on Aug. 13, 1979, he kissed his nervous parents good bye in the driveway of their home in Mercersburg, Pa., and began to run.</p>
        <p>"I was drawn forward with a little bit of faith, a lot of hope, and, at least for a few steps, a little gravity," he says in his commentary. On that first day he ran 32 miles, pitched his tent in a hollow by a river and concluded, "This was a good day."</p>
        <p>The 19 months that followed were filled with many other good days and memorable encounters, but there were also times of drudgery and despair.</p>
        <p>"Running across desert was the hardest, technically," he said, referring to the Texas-California leg. "It took me about 10 weeks to do it. Maybe the worst of it was not being clean, not being able to shower, then getting up the next morning and running another one."</p>
        <p>On those days when Mr. Bell came upon a town in twilight, he would ask people where he could find some shelter. Sometimes they invited him into their homes, but in several places the police put him in jail overnight.</p>
        <p>The first time this happened, Mr. Bell was in a small town in Georgia. He recalled the incident in a commentary: "The police chief said to me, 'So you're  lookin' for a place to crash, is that it? Well, I reckon unless you've got any objections, you'll be spendin' the night right here in our jail cell.' He was about 80 pounds bigger than I was and much better armed, so I chirped, 'Jail, sure.' "</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Bell said this may have been the low point of the entire trip: "The physical feeling of having a steel door locked on you."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell said there were only about 10 really awful times during his journey. "But almost every day, I met 10 to 15 people who went out of their way to offer  me things or said things that made my spirits soar," he said.</p>
        <p>One of the most memorable random acts of kindness occurred when Mr. Bell was  sitting on the steps of a general store in Bell City, La., eating his usual meal of bread and crackers. A middle-aged man stopped to ask where he was going. After Mr. Bell briefly related his mission, the man, Norman Fruge, said, "How'd  you like to put away those crackers and come try some good Louisiana gumbo?"</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell enjoyed the gumbo, the Fruge family's companionship, the overnight shelter and, as it turned out, much more. Early the next morning, the Fruges received a call informing them that their daughter had gone into labor at a hospital 20 miles away -- right on Mr. Bell's running route. He accepted their offer to meet them in the maternity ward, and there he shared the family's intimate experience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell concluded in his commentary: "Once again, to borrow a phrase, when I was hungry, somebody had fed me; where I was a stranger, somebody had taken me in. And that, far more than any visions of gold medal glory, is what kept me going."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell's Olympic fantasy fizzled out when he was running down the Cascades  mountains in the State of Washington, 6,000 miles into the trip. He felt a grinding in one knee and over the following few days it didn't go away. Mr. Bell realized he would have to walk the final 4,000 miles. "My injury was frustrating, but it was liberating," he said. "It had become clear to me that the purpose of all this was not to be a great runner, but to see and learn and grow -- and if I could, to pass it along."</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bell completed his odyssey in March 1981, he began writing, expanding on his travel diary.</p>
        <p>He never did return to the corporate-commuting life. Instead, in 1985 he started teaching mathematics at Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, still writing the book part-time. He left Hotchkiss in June 1994 to work on the manuscript full-time. Then last July he walked unannounced into the Hartford lobby of Connecticut Public Radio and asked to see somebody about telling his stories on  the air.</p>
        <p>John Dankosky, the host and producer of "Morning Edition," said in an interview, "It's not something we normally do, but his stories are very well written, thoughtful and funny and his delivery is so good. He's great at getting the voice down right and he picks out all the music to accompany his pieces. We've gotten a lot of positive response from our listeners."</p>
        <p>The commentaries, which last about three minutes went on the air at Christmastime. And Mr. Dankosky has sought, unsuccessfully so far, to have National Public Radio use the commentaries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell said he sometimes gets wanderlust, but he is more interested now in  settling into domestic life with his wife, Kay Lindsay, also a schoolteacher. He said the quietly transcendent times on the road can also be found at home. "Those living moments that are almost beneath memory," he said, "are available everyday as long as your eyes can keep seeing them."</p>
        <p>Charlie Bell's commentaries are broadcast every Friday morning between 8:30 and 9 on WPKT, 90.5 in the Hartford and New Haven area and on WNR, 89.1 in the Norwich and New London area. They are repeated Friday nights between 6 and 6:30  on those two stations and on WEDW, 88.5 in the Stamford and Greenwich area.</p>
