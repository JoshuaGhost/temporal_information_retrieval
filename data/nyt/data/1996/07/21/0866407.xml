        <p>PEOPLE WITH SHORT MEMORIES Americans, say -- may see the early-music movement as a relatively recent invention, dating from the 1950's and 60's, when it began to command a major segment of the classical recording industry. They may see it, too, as a product of American ingenuity -- that of the sainted early-music pioneer Noah Greenberg and the New York Pro Musica Antiqua -- later taken over by the English, who have ruled the roost ever since.</p>
        <p>Even if the history were accurate, it is now ancient. New York and the United States can hardly trade any longer on Greenberg's glory while awaiting a new messiah. And the English scene, which was perhaps never as vital as national boosterism in the press and recording industry made it seem, has stagnated. Over the last decade, while no one was looking, the center of gravity of the early-music world shifted, from London -- more precisely, from some watery point between London and Amsterdam -- to the heart of this ancient city on the Rhine.  In truth, the move is simply a historical correction, restoring curatorship of older repertory, instruments and interpretive wisdom to one of its original seats and 1950's hotbeds.</p>
        <p>Yet the shift is significant, for it both reflects and furthers a revitalization in the performance of early music throughout Central Europe, even as such efforts languish in the United States. Moreover, through recordings the  shift has given worldwide prominence to a gritty interpretive style inspired in  large part by a Cologne favorite son, Reinhard Goebel, the director of Musica Antiqua Koln. Without necessarily intending to, this style also gives performers on conventional instruments an avenue back into early repertory, which they have too readily ceded to specialists in recent decades.</p>
        <p>The Cologne manner, though no less "historically informed" than the often slick and faceless performances still trickling out of London, seems more intent on finding and putting across the individuality of a composer -- indeed, of a single work. It is a rebuke to authenticist navel-gazing, which dominated early  music a few years ago, and to the modernist scorn for interpretation, which has  for decades inflicted so much blandness on conventional performances of standard repertory.</p>
        <p>In short, early music has gone post-modern, making scholarly considerations elbow for room with Romantic rhetorical gestures and outright personal whimsy. And aptly, it has done so in a city where noble antiquity -- what little of it survived Allied bombing in World War II -- nestles casually alongside often ugly modernity.</p>
        <p>As a historic commercial crossroads, Cologne (Koln, to natives) has always been a melting pot. Over the last two decades, it has become a powerful magnet for performers of early music, not least from the United States. Michael Willens, a bass player and conductor once busy in New York, moved here a few months ago, joining expatriates of such long standing as Benjamin Bagby and Barbara Thornton, who established the medieval vocal group Sequentia here in 1977.</p>
        <p>Recordings have offered glimmerings of such developments, but the full reality of the situation, as shown in the Rheinisches Musikfest here in the late spring, is overwhelming. New York has never mustered more than one or two Baroque orchestras; London, in its mid-80's heyday boasted some half-dozen, but  they all drew heavily on the same pool of overworked, underpaid musicians and, thus, all tended to sound alike. Cologne now has at least that many Baroque orchestras with independent memberships and distinctive personalities.</p>
        <p>"Even if London is 10 or 12 times bigger than Cologne, we have 10 times more  performers of early music," said Klaus L. Neumann, who, as director of early music at the West German Radio in Cologne, has worked with musicians from both cities. Even after allowance for hyperbole -- London's population is 7 million;  Cologne's, 1 million -- the sheer quantity of activity here is as remarkable as  the quality.</p>
        <p>Its range was suggested in a remarkable series of concerts by Cologne groups, woven into the festival's multitextured fabric with no particular fanfare. In the space of three evenings, scattered among folk, pop and avant-garde presentations, Sequentia sang music of the medieval nun Hildegard of Bingen; Roland Wilson led Musica Fiata Koln in works by the early Baroque master Michael Praetorius; Mr. Goebel and Musica Antiqua explored Rhenish Baroque composers as obscure as Carolus Hacquardt and Hugo Wilderer; Condanza Spirituale offered modern dance to works by Tarquinio Me rula and Bach, and Christoph Spering and Das Neue Orchester performed Schumann's "Manfred" on early instruments, with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau speaking the title role.</p>
        <p>"At the moment, there is a very big gap between 1300 and 1550," the earnest Mr. Wilson, a transplanted Englishman, said of Cologne's early-music coverage without a trace of irony. "There's nothing going on there, and that's a big disappointment." Could any other city define its deficiencies so narrowly? A New Yorker didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
        <p>Not heard on this visit were countless other performers, including the venerable Cappella Coloniensis, which set a modern standard of Baroque playing in the 1950's; Cantus Colln, which excels in early Baroque vocal music, and Andreas Staier, a fine harpsichordist and fortepianist. Catching up with Concerto Koln, one of the hot newer bands, required a side trip to Hamburg.</p>
        <p>Indeed, but for the festival, it would have been hard to glean any quick sense of the scope of activity here. For Cologne, a smallish city, after all, does not sustain a lively early-music "scene." Instead, it functions as a center, radiating performances through tours, recordings and broadcasts.</p>
        <p>The West German Radio (or WDR, for Westdeutscher Rundfunk), which is based in Cologne, has been crucial to this development. Under the enlightened leadership  of Alfred Krings, a legend hereabout, the WDR founded the Cappella Coloniensis in 1954 and became the first network to establish an early-music department, in  1976. Mr. Neumann, who has directed the department ever since, has been a nurturing godfather to early music not only in Cologne but also throughout Germany. Working with musicologists around the world, his staff prepares reams of old repertory, much of it untouched for centuries, for venturesome performers.</p>
        <p>Of course, no such remarkable industry springs up overnight. Cologne traces its musical antiquarianism back to 1835, when Mendelssohn carried forward his project of Baroque revivals with Handel's oratorio "Solomon" at an earlier Rhenish music festival. The work was presented "in its original form, with no changes whatsoever," the Kolnische Zeitung, a local newspaper, reported, despite the proto-Victorian chorus of 427 and orchestra of 179.</p>
        <p>INFLUENTIAL DENIZENS OF THE city fostered enthusiasm for old instruments and  repertory fully a century ago. So how did Cologne lose its edge?</p>
        <p>From the remote perspective of the United States, Germany seemed a nonstarter in in the great upswelling of early music in the 70's. Even the Collegium Aureum, founded in Cologne by Krings in 1962 and directed by Franzjosef Maier, retained a wiry, "modern" sound, to judge from LP's, despite its use of period instruments.</p>
        <p>The impression was not wholly erroneous.</p>
        <p>"The disaster started with the students' revolution in '68," said Mr. Neumann. "One of the older leaders was the well-known musicologist Adorno. He always hated music which was not performed to perfection. At the time, there were many amateurs doing early music, and the ban on music played by amateurs followed through the students and right into the schools. So the early-music scene in Germany vanished."</p>
        <p>In fact, the influential Theodor W. Adorno's antipathy toward the early-music movement extended farther, to its perceived aims. "At times one can hardly avoid the suspicion that the sole concern of today's Bach devotees is to see that no inauthentic dynamics, modifications of tempo, oversize choirs and orchestras creep in," he wrote in 1967. "They seem to wait with potential fury lest any more humane impulse become audible in the rendition."</p>
        <p>SO IT IS HARDLY SURPRISING that when early-music performance took new life in Germany in the late 70's, it not only displayed high technical standards but also partook of a new esthetic, concerned more with musical expression than with precise historical reconstruction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goebel, who founded Musica Antiqua in 1973, took the lead in developing a new German style of performance. It is actually a multiplicity of styles. At his best, Mr. Goebel seems to be divining, even brilliantly inventing, a suitable style for each work, as in his superb, dryly understated 1981 recording of Jean  Gilles's precariously sweet Requiem.</p>
        <p>"We make it very mannered and sophisticated, very Continental," he mincingly  told a player in a rehearsal for the festival concert, partly, perhaps, for the  amusement of a visitor. But when Mr. Goebel upbraided another player, demanding  "activity" rather than passivity, he struck to the heart of Cologne style, which is everywhere hands-on, engaged, fiery. When a cellist failed to inflect the continuo adequately, Mr. Goebel played the entire line on his violin, showing ways to color and differentiate every note.</p>
        <p>The ebullient Mr. Goebel, one of Franz josef Maier's more rebellious students, is universally cited as the charismatic leader of early-music life in Cologne today. Although Musica Antiqua lists only four other members just now, hundreds of the city's early-music specialists have performed with it, as extras in larger works if not members. And for good or ill, no one who has worked with Mr. Goebel is likely to forget the experience. Intensity shines through his round face, rosy features and puckish demeanor. He is an inspiring,  sometimes brutal taskmaster with a delightful, often scathing wit.</p>
        <p>At 43, he is also a felicitious symbol for this city, which lost 90 percent of its historic center to bombing raids in World War II and quickly rebuilt, not always prettily but with bullish determination. Mr. Goebel used to lead Musica Antiqua as a crack fiddler but was afflicted with repetitive stress syndrome five years ago, losing the ability to finger with his left hand. He has since retrained himself to play with hands reversed, a feat with few, if any, precedents at the international virtuoso level. (Rudolf Kolisch, of the famed Kolisch and Pro Arte Quartets, did likewise early in the century after a childhood injury.)</p>
        <p>"I started as second viola and have worked my way back up to second violin,"  Mr. Goebel said. "I promise you that I will play the Bach sonatas before I am 50." No one who knows him doubts it for a moment.</p>
        <p>"This city is very much like Reinhard," said Mr. Bagby, of Sequentia. "He's from around here, and he's a smart aleck. The image I always have is, this is a  river town, and he's like the Mark Twain of early music. He's smart, he's fresh, he's critical, and he's productive. Everybody's passing through all the time, and nothing impresses him."</p>
        <p>Mr. Goebel cites as his mentor not his principal teacher, Maier, but the irascible harpsichordist Hugo Ruf. "He's a living difficulty," said Mr. Goebel,  who might as well have been describing himself.</p>
        <p>"What comes out of the town -- and that is an inheritance of my teachers and  of the spirit -- is, try something new," he added. "Let's expand the barriers and the limitations of normal repertoire. In England, if one group starts with Haydn, two others start with Haydn -- by accident. Here there is a sort of respect. I want respect for what I do, and I give it to others."</p>
        <p>So while all those Mozart, then Beethoven, then Haydn disks were emanting from London, Musica Antiqua was exploring little-known music by Johann David Heinichen and Francesco Maria Veracini, and Concerto Koln was trying Antonio Rosetti and Johann Baptist Vanhal.</p>
        <p>Then again, this repertory may just need the Cologne touch, for it does not,  by and large, consist of undisputed, towering masterpieces. "It is not music of  structure," said Werner Ehrhardt, the violinist who leads Concerto Koln, "but wonderful music." Not so much transcendent and imposing as earthy, mercurial and charming, it takes some selling to lift it out of its time, a task for which the Cologne style is ideally suited.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ehrhardt calls that style -- or, again, that complex of styles -- "a little bit extravagant" and is more inclined than Mr. Goebel to credit it to Maier. "Don't play shy, and always together with the others," Mr. Ehrhardt quoted Maier, in words that might serve as a motto for this rough-and-ready city, which stoutly maintains its own German dialect (Kolsch) and its own type of beer (yes, Kolsch).</p>
        <p>Crucially for early music, Cologne has also produced and held a steady supply of charismatic figures, from Krings on, distinctly unlike New York. The most dynamic American in the field, William Christie, has cast his lot to wondrous effect with the French.</p>
        <p>"It's very sad about the States," said Mr. Willens, the new American Kolner.  "I hope early music doesn't disappear totally there, but it could, within the next 30 years or so. It's sad, because there are so many talented players. But there's nobody like Reinhard Goebel. There's no leadership there."</p>
        <p>Mr. Willens tried to supply some, founding the Orchestra of Then and Now in New York, to play early and modern repertory. It sank without a trace. So far, he reports, omens are better for his Cologne counterpart, the Orchester Damals und Heute.</p>
        <p>Cologne Comes Home</p>
        <p>Here is merely the tip of the iceberg: a few CD's in which early-music specialists at work in Cologne make overfamil iar masterpieces sound fresh or works of the second rank seem first-rate.</p>
        <p>* Heinichen: Dresden Concertos (Musica Antiqua Koln directed by Reinhard Goebel. Archiv 437 549-2; two CD's). One of the greatest, most revealing Baroque recording projects ever, which has produced several follow-ups, including Heinichen vocal music (447 092-2; two CD's).</p>
        <p>* Rebel: "Les Elemens"; Gluck: "Alessandro"; Telemann: Sonata in E minor (Musica Antiqua Koln directed by Mr. Goebel. Archiv 445 824-2). Three very different works, each given a vital, thoroughly considered style of its own.</p>
        <p>* Rosetti: Symphonies (Concerto Koln. Teldec 4509 98420-2). Another great revelation, which has inspired Concerto Koln to present a Rosetti festival in Cologne. * Mendelssohn: String Symphonies (Concerto Koln. Teldec 4509 94565-2, 98435-2).  With a third disk to follow, a survey of youthful Mendelssohn works that shows how effectively the intense Cologne style avoids any hint of preciousness.</p>
        <p>* Bach: "Clavierubung I, II" (Andreas Staier, harpsichordist. Deutsche Harmonia  Mundi 05472-77306-2; three CD's). Thoughtful yet spontaneous readings of the partitas and the "Italian Concerto."</p>
        <p>* "Canticles of Ecstasy," "Voice of the Blood": Music of Hildegard of Bingen (Sequentia directed by Barbara Thornton. Deutsche Harmonia Mundi 05472-77320-2,  77346-2). A definite up side to the chant boom: utterly committed singing devoid of mooning sentimentality.</p>
        <p>Coming attraction: The spectacular Praetorius program presented by Roland Wilson and Musica Fiata Koln at the Rheinisches Musikfest is to be released by Sony.</p>
