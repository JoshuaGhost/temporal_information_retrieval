        <p>In-line skating is enjoyable recreation for many of New York City's young people. However, contrary to the message that appears with a photograph you published on July 2 (detail, right), the steps leading down to Bethesda Terrace  in Central Park are not for skating.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In-line skating is enjoyable recreation for many of New York City's young people. However, contrary to the message that appears with a photograph you published on July 2 (detail, right), the steps leading down to Bethesda Terrace  in Central Park are not for skating. Skating down these steps and on benches is  dangerous to the skaters and other park visitors and is destructive to one of New York's great treasures.</p>
        <p>The steps and carved adjacent walls are original components of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux's plan for Central Park and were built in the 1860's. They can be replicated, but they cannot be replaced. Skaters break the granite steps and New Brunswick sandstone walls, and the wax they use leaves behind permanent stains.</p>
        <p>Such damage in this area and on benches in front of the band shell at the Mall affects all New Yorkers and park visitors. A relatively small number threaten to reverse the investment that tens of thousands of New Yorkers, the Central Park Conservancy and New York City have made to restore Central Park. In addition, this behavior is illegal.</p>
        <p>We encourage skaters to enjoy themselves in other areas and in other ways.</p>
        <p>KAREN H. PUTNAM New York, July 2, 1996 The writer is president of the Central Park Conservancy.</p>
