        <p>The air is cool. Lush plants form a canopy overhead. Parrots, macaws, and toucans call, while tropical fish dally in huge tanks. Periodically, a flash of  lightning and a clap of thunder interrupt the patter of light rain.</p>
        <p>This is the Rainforest Cafe, which opened in the Mall of America outside Minneapolis in October 1994. And it -- an environmental theme restaurant that calls itself "a wild place to shop and eat" -- has become a marketing phenomenon. It sold stock on Wall Street last year for $4 a share (adjusted for  a recent split) and now trades around $27. It has opened two cafes near Chicago, with another coming to Disney World on Aug. 5. Nine more spots are planned, including sites in Westbury, L.I., and West Nyack, N.Y. The management is scouting a spot in Times Square.</p>

        <p>The air is cool. Lush plants form a canopy overhead. Parrots, macaws, and toucans call, while tropical fish dally in huge tanks. Periodically, a flash of  lightning and a clap of thunder interrupt the patter of light rain.</p>
        <p>This is the Rainforest Cafe, which opened in the Mall of America outside Minneapolis in October 1994. And it -- an environmental theme restaurant that calls itself "a wild place to shop and eat" -- has become a marketing phenomenon. It sold stock on Wall Street last year for $4 a share (adjusted for  a recent split) and now trades around $27. It has opened two cafes near Chicago, with another coming to Disney World on Aug. 5. Nine more spots are planned, including sites in Westbury, L.I., and West Nyack, N.Y. The management is scouting a spot in Times Square.</p>
        <p>No wonder the cafes are cropping up around the country. In Minneapolis, "We  can do 300 meals an hour," boasted Peter Katsiotis, the executive chef.</p>
        <p>Yet, the hungry sometimes wait two hours to get in to the $3.2 million Rainforest Cafe -- especially in the retail section, which includes T-shirts, books and a talking banyan tree that spouts an ecological message every 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Those interested in food need not run from this jungle. The menu offers, besides family fare like burgers ($7.95) and Caesar salad ($8.95), dishes like seafood Galapagos, which combines linguine with sauteed shrimp, salmon, swordfish and vegetables ($12.95).</p>
        <p>Rainforest's most popular dish is Rasta pasta, bow-tie pasta topped with grilled chicken, pesto, red pepper and spinach, in a garlic cream sauce ($10.95).</p>
        <p>Other specialties are "Old Man and the Sea," char-broiled swordfish topped with shrimp-and-corn salsa ($15.95), and the African wind salad, which mixes fried chicken with lettuce, carrots, cheese and fried onions ($9.95).</p>
        <p>Portions are so big that few people order dessert. When they do, Mr. Katsiotis pushes "Monkey Business," an apricot-laced coconut bread pudding ($4.95), whose recipe has been printed in Bon Appetit.</p>
        <p>The restaurant says each dish is environmentally correct -- fish are line-caught, while meat and produce are grown organically -- to satisfy Steven W. Schussler, the founder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schussler kept a prototype rain forest at home for years before finding financial backing in 1994. Now, as senior vice president for design and development, he contentedly perpetuates the Rainforests.</p>
        <p>The original Rainforest Cafe is in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn.  55425; (612) 854-7500. It is open Monday through Thursday, 11 A.M. to 10 P.M.; Friday, 11 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Saturday 10:30 A.M. to 11 P.M.; Sunday 10:30 A.M. to 9 P.M.</p>
