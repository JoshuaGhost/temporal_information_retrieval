        <p>When a terminally ill woman ended her life by an illegal, doctor-assisted suicide in 1994, Svend Robinson was at her side, risking up to 14 years in prison.</p>
        <p>A socialist member of Parliament elected five times from his Vancouver constituency of Burnaby-Kingsway, Mr. Robinson had served nine days in a work camp that same year while on another of his crusades.</p>
        <p>A judge found him guilty of criminal contempt for blocking a logging road around Vancouver Island's Clayoquot Sound. Demonstrating then against the clearcutting of rain forest timber, he was sentenced to 14 days, but released early for good behavior.</p>
        <p>He heckled President Reagan on Nicaragua policy and "Star Wars" while the President was speaking to Parliament in 1987. "Of course, I'd do it again," Mr.  Robinson said in a recent interview. "I think it was important Reagan understood that some Canadians differed fundamentally with him on certain issues."</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson, 44, the first member of Parliament to openly declare his homosexuality and the first to take a same-sex date to the Governor General's Ball that opens the parliamentary session, is often called Canada's protester in chief.</p>
        <p>"I try to draw attention to injustice," he said.</p>
        <p>He is now pressing ahead on his most agonizing struggle. He has reintroduced  a bill to decriminalize doctors' efforts to assist suicides of the incurably ill.</p>
        <p>His legislative action coincides with charges recently brought against a Toronto doctor specializing in AIDS. Dr. Maurice Genereux is accused of helping  a patient kill himself, the first doctor ever formally charged with this offense in Canada</p>
        <p>Though not medically trained himself, Mr. Robinson is fast achieving a visibility here similar to that of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the retired American pathologist, who has admitted to attending the suicides of at least 30 people and who has recently been acquitted of violating Michigan statutes.</p>
        <p>Because of the penalties risked in Canada, one of those seeking Dr. Kevorkian's assistance was a Canadian from Windsor, Austin Bastable, 53, a victim of multiple sclerosis, who crossed into Michigan in early May to achieve  his goal.</p>
        <p>After a Canadian Supreme Court decision, the issue appears to have gone as far as it can judicially, which Mr. Robinson says is why he has taken his legislative initiative.</p>
        <p>The high court in 1993 ruled 5 to 4 against decriminalizing assisted suicides. The woman who brought this case, Sue Rodriguez, 43, of Victoria, suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease. She took her own life anyway with the illegal aid of a doctor who provided her with lethal drugs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson, who had become friendly with Ms. Rodriguez during her legal battle, was at her side at her death. "She was an extraordinarily courageous woman who put a human face on this struggle," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson refused to tell the police the name of the doctor who assisted Ms. Rodriguez. The British Columbia justice ministry appointed a special prosecutor, but after a yearlong investigation he declined to bring charges against the politician.</p>
        <p>To convict Mr. Robinson of assisting in the suicide, the prosecutor, Robert Johnston, said it would have been necessary to prove he helped administer the drug, and such proof did not exist.</p>
        <p>The Supreme Court decision and the Rodriguez suicide gave the matter such high prominence in Canada that Prime Minister Jean Chretien promised a free vote in the House of Commons, meaning that members are ruled by conscience, not party discipline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson fears that Mr. Chretien will not meet his promise. "He's spooked by the religious right," he said, "the same Neanderthals who voted against the amendment to the Human Rights Act." That legislation, passed in May, banned discrimination against homosexuals.</p>
        <p>"Chretien has never been comfortable taking on these social issues," Mr. Robinson said, "but I intend to continue to raise this one and push it as far as I can."</p>
        <p>Opinion polls consistently show that up to three-quarters of the population accept medically assisted suicides. "The public is light years ahead of the politicians," said Mr. Robinson, who has been a member of Parliament for 17 years.</p>
        <p>Analysts say Mr. Robinson's campaigns for euthanasia, environmental concerns  and indigenous and gay rights play an important role linking social movement politics to the Canadian political process.</p>
        <p>"He's not so much a model of the process as a safety valve," said Richard Johnston, professor of political science at the University of British Columbia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Robinson, who was born in Minnesota, calls himself "an academic brat." His father, Wayne, taught literature and linguistics at Simon Fraser University  in Vancouver.</p>
        <p>His mother, a Danish-born painter named Edith Jensen, was active in the Vietnam peace movement and took young Svend with her while raising money for the indigenous people and canvassing for men like Tommy Douglas, a Baptist minister  who founded the socialist New Democratic Party, which Mr. Robinson represents in the House of Commons.</p>
        <p>The party was hammered in the 1993 national elections from 43 to a mere 9 of  the 295 House seats. Last fall Mr. Robinson almost won the party leadership, but at the last minute big union members rallied to a Nova Scotian, Alexa McDonough.</p>
        <p>"My leadership would have represented quite a profound shift in this party,"  Mr. Robinson said. "The old boys just didn't want to lose control."</p>
        <p>Among the disappointed was James Laxer, professor of political science at Atkinson College of York University, who himself ran second for the party leadership in 1971 against David Lewis.</p>
        <p>"Robinson has done more to breathe life into the ailing body of Canadian social democracy than any other person," Professor Laxer said. "He has created excitement and has attracted -- God forbid -- young people."</p>
