        <p>British Airways P.L.C.'s pilots' union said yesterday that it had called off  plans for a strike to begin next Tuesday after British Airways raised its pay offer and made other concessions. The union called the new offer a "great success." It said British Airways had agreed to increase the pay of pilots in its operations at Gatwick Airport in London and to drop a plan to shrink crew rest areas on Boeing 747 jets.</p>
        <p>British Airways said it had agreed to raise the pay of the Gatwick pilots, who are paid about a third of the L74,000 ($114,000) average for British Airways pilots, by 10 percent this year in return for a similar increase in working hours. The union said British Airways would raise the pay scale for new pilots,  though it did not say by how much.</p>
