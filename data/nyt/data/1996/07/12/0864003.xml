        <p>GOLF</p>
        <p>Weiskopf Turns It Around</p>
        <p>One day after playing so poorly in the pro-am that he did not want to turn in his scorecard, Tom Weiskopf shot a six-under-par 66 yesterday and took a one-stroke lead in the first round of the Senior Players Championship in Dearborn, Mich.</p>
        <p>Bob Charles, the first-round leader at the United States Senior Open last week, and Lee Trevino were at 67 in the final major of the year on the PGA Senior Tour.</p>
        <p>Gibby Gilbert, John Bland and Bruce Summerhays were at 68 on the Jack Nicklaus-designed T.P.C. of Michigan. Five players were tied at 70, including Hale Irwin, who leads the PGA Senior Tour in earnings for 1996. (AP)</p>
        <p>SLIM LEAD FOR HOCH: Scott Hoch shot a seven-under 64 yesterday and took a one-shot lead in the first round of the Michelob Championship in Williamsburg, Va., which is bracing for Hurricane Bertha. Rain and high winds were expected to begin overnight.</p>
        <p>Hoch had eight birdies on his first trip over the 6,797-yard River Course at  Kingsmill Golf Club. Curtis Strange, never a winner on his home course, and Fred Funk shot 65's. (AP)</p>

        <p>Top-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia defeated Karim Alami of Morocco, 6-3, 6-3, yesterday to move into the quarterfinals of the Swiss Open in Gstaad. Alberto Berasategui took another step toward winning his fourth tournament in as many weeks, defeating eighth-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain, 7-5, 6-2. (AP)</p>
        <p>EDBERG TOPS QUALIFIER: Top-seeded Stefan Edberg beat the qualifier Lars Jonsson, 6-2, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, yesterday to reach the quarterfinals of the Swedish Open in Bastad. Today, Edberg will face his training partner, the 21-year-old Thomas Johansson. (AP)</p>
        <p>BLACK IS THE ONE AND ONLY: With the quarterfinal round not yet completed at the Hall of Fame tournament in Newport, R.I., top-seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe was the only seeded player remaining after yesterday's action.</p>
        <p>Third-seeded Michael Joyce withdrew with an injured pectoral muscle in his second-round match with unseeded Nicolas Pereira of Venezuela and sixth-seeded Martin Damm of the Czech Republic lost to unseeded Andrei Olhovskiy of Russia, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4). (Reuters)</p>
        <p>COLLEGE FOOTBALL</p>
        <p>Rose Bowl in Title Mix?</p>
        <p>A true national championship game in college football could become a reality  within 60 days and be played as early as January 1999.</p>
        <p>Jack French, executive director of the Tournament of Roses Association, said  yesterday that the Rose Bowl was close to a proposal with the bowl alliance that would integrate the Big Ten and Pacific-10 into the national title picture.</p>
        <p>Such a deal would take time because contracts between conferences and TV networks would have to either expire or be re-worked. But French said he believed an agreement could be reached "within 60 days" with one stipulation: If the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions end up Nos. 1 and 2 in The Associated Press writers' poll and CNN-USA Today coaches' poll, the Rose Bowl must be the site of the national title game.

        <p>CYCLING</p>
        <p>DuPont Pulls Out of Tour</p>
        <p>DuPont is withdrawing as the main sponsor of the largest cycling race in the  United States after next year's event, ending a relationship that began in 1990.</p>
        <p>"Over the past six years, the Tour DuPont has been an excellent vehicle for promoting our products," said Jamie Murray, DuPont brand manager. "However, we need to focus more on strategic markets in other parts of the world where a sustained annual program versus a two-week event can better leverage the DuPont  brand equity for profitable growth."
