        <p>A Federal judge has approved a settlement estimated to be worth $200 million  in a class-action lawsuit against Paine Webber Inc. related to its sale of limited partnerships. Paine Webber Group Inc., the parent company of the brokerage, said the settlement would not cost it anything more than the reserves it had already set aside. The settlement provides $125 million in cash and additional guarantees valued at $75 million, according to Nicholas Chimicles, the lawyer who headed a committee of law firms that represented 150,000 disgruntled investors. The value of the guarantees could change as the value of  the partnerships fluctuate. Paine Webber guaranteed that some of the plaintiffs  would get their original investments back by the year 2000. It guaranteed for others, depending on which partnership they had invested in, minimum payments by the same year. Paine Webber will pay the $125 million in cash to those who had invested in partnerships without guarantees, Mr. Chimicles said. Paine Webber brokers sold about $2.5 billion in real estate, energy and other limited partnerships between 1980 and 1992. Investors contended the brokers misrepresented the risks involved, used fraudulent marketing materials and collected inflated fees. In January, Paine Webber said it had agreed to pay $292.5 million to settle client claims.</p>
