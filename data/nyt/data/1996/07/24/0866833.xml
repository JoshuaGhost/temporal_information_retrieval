        <p>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company has agreed to buy a unit of the J. E. Robert Companies, a firm that has been a partner with Goldman in some 37 real estate investments worth more than $8.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Goldman, the biggest United States investment banking partnership, plans to pay about $50 million for the Venture unit of J. E. Robert, a closely held real  estate investment management company based in McLean, Va., according to people familiar with the sale. Goldman declined to comment on the price, as did Joseph  E.

        <p>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company has agreed to buy a unit of the J. E. Robert Companies, a firm that has been a partner with Goldman in some 37 real estate investments worth more than $8.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Goldman, the biggest United States investment banking partnership, plans to pay about $50 million for the Venture unit of J. E. Robert, a closely held real  estate investment management company based in McLean, Va., according to people familiar with the sale. Goldman declined to comment on the price, as did Joseph  E. Robert Jr., the seller's chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>The companies have invested as partners since 1992, with Goldman's Whitehall Street Real Estate Limited Partnerships providing the capital and J. E. Robert arranging the transactions.</p>
        <p>J. E. Robert is selling the unit, which has about 300 employees, because the  relationship with Goldman restricted it from "a host of new opportunities," Mr.  Robert said. For example, J. E. Robert plans to start its own investment fund, Mr. Robert said in a letter to employees.</p>
        <p>Goldman, which controls Rockefeller Center and the Westin Hotel chain, brings in-house the J. E. Robert group that helped make some of its real estate investments.</p>
        <p>The Whitehall partnerships had about $2 billion in capital at the end of last year. J. E. Robert plans to remain a limited partner in Goldman's funds.</p>
        <p>The J. E. Robert purchase, reported in The Wall Street Journal, is expected to close in September.</p>
