        <p>A woman accused of taking more than $1 million from reporters to house them during the Olympics was jailed on theft charges yesterday after they said she reneged on the deal.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, dozens of reporters from at least seven news agencies are in a race to find rooms before the Summer Games start July 19.</p>
        <p>After a hearing yesterday in Atlanta Municipal Court, MEGGEN MILLS, 33, of Dallas, was jailed on $100,000 bond. She was arrested Monday night on seven counts of theft by deception after the reporters confronted her at Mayfair Apartments in Atlanta, demanding their money back.</p>
        <p>Housing is extremely tight in Atlanta as the Olympics approach. Most hotels and many apartments were booked a year ago for the games.</p>
        <p>The reporters work for television stations in New York, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and England. They said they had given Mills more than $1 million for apartments, mobile phones and rental cars. When they arrived, some got only half the apartments they had requested. About $500,000 paid to Mills isn't accounted for  and police are trying to sort out how many rooms are still needed, said MARKO BURGAR, assistant city solicitor.</p>
        <p>"She broke us," said MICHELLE NAILI, executive producer of TV Globo of Brazil. "My company trusted me to make all the accommodations and now I'm broke." (AP)</p>
