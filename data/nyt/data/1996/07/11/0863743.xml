        <p>First Bank System Inc. reported yesterday that its second-quarter earnings jumped 84 percent, while its operating profits advanced 21 percent, paced by rising fee revenue from its trust and corporate payment systems units.</p>
        <p>The company said its net income totaled $254.1 million, or $1.81 a share, up  from $137.9 million, or $1 a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier.</p>
        <p>First Bank said that it had $87 million, or 61 cents a share, in one-time gains in the quarter, and that its profits from operations totaled $167.1 million, or $1.18 a share.</p>
        <p>The operating profits matched the average forecast in a Zacks Investment Research survey of 24 analysts.</p>
        <p>The gains were partly a result of First Interstate Bancorp's decision to back out of an agreement to be bought by First Bank, which is based in Minneapolis. As such, First Bank received a $200 million pretax breakup fee from Wells Fargo  &amp; Company, the eventual buyer of First Interstate, that included $75 million in  the second quarter.</p>
        <p>First Bank also listed a $65 million state income tax refund and $400,000 in  securities gains as pretax items.</p>
        <p>Noninterest income, including fees, provided most of the earnings improvement, rising 16 percent, to $219.5 million.</p>
        <p>Net interest income -- the interest First Bank earned minus the interest it paid -- rose 7.9 percent from a year earlier, to $391.8 million.</p>
        <p>First Bank set aside $35 million for expected loan losses, up from $27 million a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Noninterest expenses, mostly salaries, rose only 1 percent, to $306.2 million.</p>
        <p>First Bank, the 25th-biggest United States bank at the end of the first quarter, had $36.2 billion in assets at the end of June, an 8.2 percent increase from a year earlier. It has 384 branches in 11 states.</p>
