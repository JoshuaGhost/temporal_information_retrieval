        <p>Students in Pleasantville will not mark the anniversary of last October's Million Man March as a school holiday after all, the city's school board president said yesterday. The board had approved a calendar change in May that also canceled the traditional Veterans Day holiday. On Tuesday, the Atlantic County Board of Freeholders voted to ask the board to reconsider. Lincoln Green, the school board president, said all nine members favored restoring the Million  Man March anniversary as a school day but without giving students Veterans Day off. The board will vote on July 23.</p>
