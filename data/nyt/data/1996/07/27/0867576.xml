        <p>Western Resources Inc. said yesterday that it had agreed to immediate rate cuts in a case that has been tied to Western's hostile takeover attempt of the Kansas City Power and Light Company. Western originally proposed phasing in rate cuts over seven years, which critics said was an attempt to drag out the rate reduction while it continued efforts to buy Kansas City Power. Lower rates would conceivably make the Western offer less attractive to Kansas City Power shareholders. Kansas City Power directors have rejected Western's merger proposal and are pursuing a merger with Utilicorp United Inc., the fellow Kansas City utility.</p>
