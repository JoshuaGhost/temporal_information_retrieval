        <p>From the morning talk shows to a lunchtime book signing in midtown, Bob Dole  the Presidential candidate became Bob Dole the author yesterday, trading in the  indignities of the campaign trail for the very different indignities of a book tour.</p>
        <p>"Bob Dole looks 50 in person!" announced Kathie Lee Gifford, the talk show host, by way of a greeting to her morning guest, who at 72, tends not to talk about his age. And a moment later, after a few moments' banter with Mr. Dole and his wife and co-author, Elizabeth Dole, she offered another discovery about the  likely Republican Presidential candidate: "Bob Dole cracking jokes!"</p>

        <p>From the morning talk shows to a lunchtime book signing in midtown, Bob Dole  the Presidential candidate became Bob Dole the author yesterday, trading in the  indignities of the campaign trail for the very different indignities of a book tour.</p>
        <p>"Bob Dole looks 50 in person!" announced Kathie Lee Gifford, the talk show host, by way of a greeting to her morning guest, who at 72, tends not to talk about his age. And a moment later, after a few moments' banter with Mr. Dole and his wife and co-author, Elizabeth Dole, she offered another discovery about the  likely Republican Presidential candidate: "Bob Dole cracking jokes!"</p>
        <p>Three hours later, Mr. Dole's happy encounter with Mrs. Gifford seemed almost easy, as Mr. and Mrs. Dole crammed into a corner of a Barnes &amp; Noble bookstore on 5th Avenue with 500 copies of "Unlimited Partners: Our American Story" (Simon &amp; Schuster: $24) stacked at their feet and piled on shelves around them.</p>
        <p>"This is me -- I'm the one on the left," Mr. Dole gestured with a wry grin, holding up a copy of the book, seated behind a table as photographers and autograph seekers clamored over tables and shelves to get a picture.</p>
        <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dole signed autographs for the first 20 customers, then after the photographers had been moved aside, left the table to hand out copies autographed in advance. (Mr. Dole, whose war injuries makes it difficult to write with his good, left arm, signed 1,000 books over the last few days to prepare for the event yesterday and another book signing in Los Angeles on Wednesday).</p>
        <p>It was, as far as book signings go, a success, if not a major one. Mr. Dole was greeted upon his arrival at Barnes &amp; Noble by a crowd of patrons stretching  around the corner. Within 45 minutes, the line had evaporated, when a store official said a comparatively modest 380 people had turned out.</p>
        <p>Still, some autograph-seekers had waited 90 minutes to meet the Doles. "I have goose bumps up and down my back," said William Weber, a 21-year-old psychology student at New York University who is working for the Republican Party. "I think that was the most thrilling moment in my life. I think I'm going to pass out."</p>
        <p>Mr. Weber's enthusiasm at the moment was widely, though definitely not universally shared by the lunchtime crowd bustling through the crowded aisles. "He looks like he's going to keel over," said Glenn Yanofsky, an insurance underwriter and Republican who planned to vote for Mr. Dole, said after catching a glimpse of the candidate.</p>
        <p>From New York, Mr. Dole headed to Atlantic City, where he took a half-hour stroll along a boardwalk thronged by onlookers, before turning to the real reason of his visit: two fund-raisering events, one sponsored by Donald J. Trump and the other by Lewis Eisenberg, the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey who is also Mr. Dole's New Jersey finance chairman. Aides said Mr. Dole raised nearly $1 million at both events last night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dole went to some effort not to draw too much attention to his fund-raising effort, closing them to the press, as he sometimes does. At the same time, Mr. Dole tried to turn the tables on Mr. Clinton, distributing literature detailing some of the contributions Mr. Clinton has received from the industry.</p>
        <p>According to a report released last week by the Center for Public Integrity,  a group that lobbies for campaign finance reform, casino owners have been far more generous to both parties in this election than in any before. Mr. Dole raised at least $200,000 in 1995 and the first four months of 1996 from gambling interests, while Mr. Clinton raised $62,000, the report said.</p>
