        <p>Carrying a swimsuit cover-up for a weekend by the sea can mean one extra piece in an already crammed carryall. So the smart thing is to take a cover-up that has other uses, like an oversize man's shirt or a big cotton pareo that can double as a shawl.  Here are some other ideas:</p>
        <p>A crinkled-gauze tunic with a hood in black or white by Calvin Klein ($117 at Saks Fifth Avenue) can also go out to dinner over pants. A short dress with a ribbed black top and a black-and-white plaid skirt by Baja Blue ($43 at Lord &amp; Taylor) can go to lunch or shopping in town. A sleeveless black dress with a mesh midriff by Anne Klein ($37 at Lord &amp; Taylor) can go out dancing.</p>
