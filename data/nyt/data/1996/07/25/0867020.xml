        <p>A new test for the AIDS virus that can be taken at home went on sale nationwide today, two days after gaining approval by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>Home Access Health Corporation of Hoffman Estates, Ill., is the second company to win F.D.A. approval of kits that let people take a blood sample at home, mail it to a laboratory and learn by telephone if they have tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>A home-screening test by Johnson &amp; Johnson, called Confide, was introduced in Texas and Florida and is now available in most of the country, but not in New York and California, through a toll-free telephone number, said Jeffrey Leebaw,  a company spokesman. He said the test would be available in drugstores by Sept.  1.</p>
        <p>The Home Access Express test, also available via a toll-free number, promises confidential test results in three business days. Later this year, the company will make Home Access tests available for sale in drugstores, with results in one week for $39.95, $10 less than the Express test.</p>
        <p>To conduct the test, the person pricks a finger and places drops of blood on  a test card and mails it in a prepaid, protective envelope to a laboratory. The  sample has a personal identification number.</p>
        <p>For results, the person calls a toll-free number and gives an identification  number. People with positive or inconclusive results receive the news from counselors, who can refer them for long-term counseling and medical treatment. Negative results are usually given by a recording, although the caller can request a counselor at any time.</p>
        <p>Kevin Johnson, a company spokesman, said that counselors have "bachelor degrees in a related discipline, such as social-service work, psychology and counseling," and half have advanced degrees. All have participated in a four-week company training program.</p>
        <p>The toll-free number for the Home Access Express test is (800) HIV-TEST. A call to the company's toll-free number said that kits cannot be shipped until Aug. 1.</p>
        <p>The toll-free number for the Johnson &amp; Johnson Confide test is (800) THE-TEST.</p>
