        <p>A jury award for Litton Industries that would have been worth $702 million was thrown out today by a Federal judge, handing Honeywell Inc. a victory in a six-year-long antitrust case.</p>
        <p>United States District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles upheld a February jury decision that Honeywell violated antitrust laws, while striking down the amount of the verdict.</p>
        <p>Judge Pfaelzer will hear a new trial focused solely on the amount of damages. The dispute stems from charges that Honeywell monopolized a portion of  the commercial aircraft navigation market. Litton contended that it suffered losses as a result. The decision came less than two weeks after an earlier decision by Judge Pfaelzer was overturned by a Federal appeals court.</p>
        <p>The court ordered Honeywell to pay Litton for patent infringement on a device for aircraft navigation systems, while stopping short of reinstating an original $1.2 billion jury verdict. The amount of that verdict will also be determined after a hearing before Judge Pfaelzer.</p>
