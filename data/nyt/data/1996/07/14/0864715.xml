        <p>DURING the first act of ''Sonya,'' the wife of Leo Tolstoy is pointed out as a ''soul in need'' by a doctor and disciple of the literary and philosophical icon.</p>
        <p>In Act II, a Russian Orthodox priest tells Sonya how he understands her ''cry from the heart.''</p>
        <p>Such are the playwright Leon Katz's florid elucidations on the overwrought behavior of Countess Sofya Andreyevna Tolstoy, who spends much of her namesake play's three hours making a nuisance of herself, demanding to be let into the cottage where her husband of 48 years lies dying, while hostile forces keep her out. The year is 1910.</p>
        <p>Since Julie Harris is possessed of the power to communicate an interior life, her enlightened presence gives a playwright the golden gift of time. He can save it. He can cut words. He can redirect priorities. Bluntly put, he can rework his play.</p>
        <p>As Sonya, Ms. Harris reveals the depth of distress, the ambivalent pull of fierce love and eternal devotion in conflict with ideological discord.</p>
        <p>In a single moment, the actress sums up her reason for being there: to put the stamp of finality and forgiveness -- the buzzword is closure -- on a troubled, unreconciled life with a sainted man.</p>
        <p>Their ''totally opposite ideas of the meaning and purpose of existence,'' in the words of a letter Tolstoy wrote to Sonya four months before his death, led to estrangement. Sonya could not forsake the materialism that a spiritually converted Tolstoy renounced, or understand his loyalty to his leading disciple, Vladimir Gregorievich Chertkov, with its intimations of homosexuality and an idealism that eluded her.</p>
        <p>While the puzzling and fascinating ramifications of an extraordinarily volatile marriage that produced 13 children, 4 of whom -- 2 daughters and 2 sons -- figure among an eye-popping stageful of 15 characters, are unexplored, the ravings of Sonya are overexplained. Neither historically lucid nor dramatically fulfilling, Mr. Katz's play reveals a gaping hole at the center, an unsettling inconclusiveness. That Tolstoy remains unseen in a many-peopled play is an interesting challenge Mr. Katz has created, but he has failed to give a revered man a rich offstage life.</p>
        <p>Yet no playwright could reasonably expect, in three weeks' playing time, a more solid ensemble or a more bountiful production than the Phoenix Theater Company has lavished on ''Sonya.'' It all starts with the audience's gasp at the sight of Campbell Baird's imposing setting, a whopping train that revolves in an obscure railroad station, Astapovo. That happened to be the title of the first professional version of Mr. Katz's play; previously it was called ''A Death at Astapovo'') The first professional version was performed at the Yale Repertory's Winterfest series in 1983 under Lawrence Kornfeld's direction. Reno Roop (as Tolstoy's oldest son) is a holdover from that production, which also had Charles S. Dutton and John Turturro in small roles and Jan Miner as Sonya.</p>
        <p>For this production, the artistic director of the Phoenix, Bram Lewis, orchestrates the feuding and fussing family, the invading press -- Tolstoy's retreat into the woods at 82 was some media event -- and the stars' iridescent moments as though there were real drama somewhere in there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harris, in a flash, retreats into the reassurance of memory, madness and considerations of suicide, shades her voice to the darkest reaches of the virago who means business and glancingly acknowledges the comedy inherent in any photo-op, amid all her protestations. In support, note a capital cast. Philip Baker Hall (Chertkov) is an unrelenting threat, and Timothy Jerome (Dushan) is a well-tempered adversary. Jennifer Harmon, Miriam Healy-Louie, Jud Meyers and Mr. Roop are so intensely and individually effective as the Tolstoy daughters and sons -- Sonya's ''jailers'' -- that they make it theatrically clear that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. If only Mr. Katz had written just how.</p>
        <p>''Sonya'' by Leon Katz, produced by the Phoenix Theater at Purchase College in Purchase. Performances continue through next Sunday. Box office: 251-6290.</p>
