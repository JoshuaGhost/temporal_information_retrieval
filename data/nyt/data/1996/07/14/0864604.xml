        <p>The Knicks agreed to contract terms with Allan Houston and Chris Childs yesterday, giving themselves a new starting backcourt and drastically changing their team for next season.</p>
        <p>A high-ranking Knicks official confirmed both deals last night. If the two players pass physicals, they will sign contracts today.</p>
        <p>With Larry Johnson's trade to New York expected to be finalized tomorrow, the Knicks have a projected starting lineup next season of Childs, Houston, Johnson, Patrick Ewing and Charles Oakley. In a matter of days, the Knicks have  become younger and more dangerous offensively. And while the free-agent market did not bring the Knicks a big-name star like Juwan Howard or Reggie Miller, Johnson, Houston and Childs give the Knicks a much stronger team than the one that lost to the Chicago Bulls in the second round of last year's playoffs.</p>
        <p>Houston agreed to a 7-year deal worth around $55 million, while Childs agreed to a 6-year deal for $24 million. Just 25 years old, Houston blossomed for the Detroit Pistons last season, averaging 19.7 points and shooting 42.7 percent from 3-point range. Houston has one of the league's purest jump shots, and while he is not a great defender, his 6-foot-6-inch size will help the Knicks defend big guards -- something that troubled them last season.</p>
        <p>Childs, 29, played with the Nets last season, and he was one of the National  Basketball Association's most improved players, averaging 12.8 points and 7 assists. Childs is an excellent defender, a solid shooter a and a decent playmaker. He was coveted by at least six teams, but the addition of Johnson and Houston helped convince Childs that New York was a team that could win a championship. Childs's contract calls for a $500,000 bonus should the Knicks win the championship.</p>
        <p>The biggest question concerning Childs and Houston is their ability to handle the pressure of playing in New York, on a team that expects to compete for a championship. But the Knicks clearly have more talent and offensive weapons than last year, and with Johnson (27 years old), Houston, and Childs, they have added three key players who are under 30.</p>
        <p>Childs's acquisition means that Derek Harper, last year's starting point guard, will probably not be back. Harper is being pursued by Houston and Miami,  and the Knicks still have Charlie Ward to back up Childs.</p>
        <p>The Knicks did not immediately confirm the agreements with Childs and Houston, but Steve Kauffman, Childs's agent, was boarding a plane last night to  fly to New York to complete the deal today. Houston is also expected to arrive in New York today.</p>
        <p>"This is a great opportunity for Chris, and it makes him very happy," Kauffman said. "He'll be able to stay in the New York area, where he is already  comfortable.</p>
        <p>"I don't know what the Nets thought, but Chris wanted to really return to them. He wanted to come back and play for John Calipari. But this is a good situation for him. I think this happened because this is a New York team, and that's where he wanted to stay. I think he's very relieved. It only took two or  three days, but everything was very intense."</p>
        <p>The Nets had offered Childs a four-year contract worth $2.7 million a year, but that was far too low to keep him, considering how much interest there was in Childs. Meanwhile, the Pistons wanted to keep Houston, but they were restricted  financially. Detroit wanted to wait until August to sign Houston, because they needed salary cap room to pursue Dikembe Mutombo. The Knicks took advantage, offering Houston a deal that he could not refuse.</p>
        <p>Told that Childs had agreed to terms with the Knicks, Calipari, the Nets' coach, said, "It's like anything else in life -- you're disappointed, but you have to move on. If it's true, I'm happy for him. I think we made a fair offer,  not an extravagant one, but fair. This is America. I'm happy for him."</p>
        <p>The trade that is expected to bring Johnson to the Knicks, in exchange for Anthony Mason and Brad Lohaus, is expected to be finalized as early as tomorrow. The delay concerns the trade bonus that Johnson would receive as part of his contract. Although Johnson is willing to waive $800,000 of his trade bonus, league rules do not allow him to do so. The Knicks are expected to resolve this  problem tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Howard, another big-name free agent, is reportedly headed to the Miami Heat,  agreeing to a 7-year, $98 million contract. The Washington Bullets desperately hoped to re-sign Howard, but Miami's offer is worth around $20 million more than what the Bullets offered Thursday. Howard, a 6-9 All-Star forward who is just 23 years old, averaged 22.1 points and 8.1 rebounds last season. Howard's addition  would be a major building block for the Heat and Pat Riley, and Miami is expected to re-sign the free agents Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway very shortly.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the three-way deal that would have sent Charles Barkley to the Houston Rockets is reportedly off. The proposed trade would have sent Barkley to the Rockets, Mutombo to the Phoenix Suns, and Robert Horry and Sam Cassell to the Denver Nuggets. But Mutombo is looking for $12 to $14 million per season, and he may get it from the Pistons now that they have lost Houston. The Los Angeles Lakers may pursue Mutombo as well, if Shaquille O'Neal returns to the Orlando Magic.</p>
        <p>The Rockets are still expected to pursue a trade for Barkley, dealing directly with Phoenix. Barkley has been shopped by Phoenix for weeks, and the Knicks and Indiana had both expressed interest in Barkley. However, the Knicks were not able to put together a package attractive enough to entice Phoenix to deal Barkley to New York.</p>
        <p>As for O'Neal, the Lakers have offered him a 7-year, $96 million contract. Orlando is expected to top that, with a 7-year deal averaging between $14 and $15 million per season. O'Neal's decision will be determined not by money, but by where he believes he will be most happy. Orlando is still optimistic, particularly because O'Neal's mother is believed to want her son to remain in Orlando.</p>
        <p>One of O'Neal's Olympic Team teammates, Gary Payton, is close to re-signing with the Seattle Supersonics. The Sonics have offered Payton a 7-year, $70 million contract, and it is unlikely to be topped by anyone else.</p>
        <p>Less than one week into the free agency competition, the Knicks have changed  their team more drastically than any other in the N.B.A. Gone is Anthony Mason,  who will be sent to Charlotte in the trade for Johnson. Gone is Harper. John Starks? With Houston's addition, the Knicks now have three veteran shooting guards, counting Starks and Hubert Davis.</p>
        <p>It is possible the Knicks will try to move either Starks or Davis before the  beginning of the 1996-97 season. But Starks in particular may be hard to move because of his long-term contract.</p>
        <p>Still, the Knicks, who relied on basically the same core of players -- Ewing, Oakley, Harper, Starks and Mason -- in their futile quest for an N.B.A. championship have indeed closed one chapter and started a new one.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>ANTONIO DAVIS, the free-agent forward, is close to re-signing with the Indiana Pacers. . . . BRIAN WILLIAMS, the free-agent forward with the Los Angeles Clippers, has had discussions with Detroit and Seattle. . . . With all the comings and goings in the N.B.A., the one free agent who was always guaranteed to stay put was JOHN STOCKTON, the Utah Jazz guard who is the league's career leader in steals and assists. "I'm not leaving Utah," Stockton said. "If that turns around and bites me, then that's the way it goes. I'm staying here. I like it here. This is where I'm comfortable." Stockton has been a member of the Jazz since the 1984-85 season. . . . In Doral Arrowwood Summer League play last night in White Plains, KERRY KITTLES and LLOYD DANIELS each scored 16 points as the Nets' rookies and free agents beat the their counterparts with the Knicks, 103-94, to improve to 2-0. SHELTON JONES added 15  points for the Nets. JOHN STRICKLAND led the Knicks (1-1) with 31 points and 12  rebounds and the team's top draft choice, JOHN WALLACE, had 16 points.</p>
