        <p>By next summer, the bulldozers will start plowing through the stands of maple and oak and elm. Then will come the steamrollers, pushing a bed of asphalt 12 feet wide into the heart of one of the biggest and most beloved parks in the densely populated northeast corner of the state. It will be, pretty much everyone agrees, a wonderful thing. The project in question is a 12-mile bicycle path through the Palisades Interstate Park, for which the park commission received a $2 million Federal construction grant last month. The path, which will run along the ridge above the Hudson River from the George  Washington Bridge in Fort Lee to the New York State line, will give bikers an alternative to the heavily cycled Route 9W, where bicycles must compete with tractor-trailers, often without benefit of a shoulder. "It would be a great boon to be able to come off that bridge and ride safely and quietly and have gorgeous views over the Hudson," said Irwin Rosman, a member of the park commission's citizen advisory council and past president of the Bicycle Touring Club of North Jersey. "There are spots up there that are really beautiful." The trail will be the longest paved bikeway in the state, after the 60-plus miles that follow the Delaware and Raritan Canal. Officials at the state Department of Transportation say it demonstrates New Jersey's commitment to becoming more bicycle-friendly. Last year the state issued a plan aimed at increasing the number of people who ride or walk to work by 50 percent by the end of the century. The next big challenge is to figure out where to put the path. The space between Route 9W and the edge of the cliff is as little as a couple of hundred feet wide in spots, much of which is taken up by the Palisades Interstate Parkway, a  divided four-lane highway that is off limits to bicycles. Between the parkway and the cliff edge is a hiking trail called the Long Path that hikers consider sacred ground. "We're talking about a very narrow strip of land," said Richard Olsen, the assistant superintendent for the New Jersey section of the park. Early plans called for running the path between the parkway and the cliff at the south end, then crossing under the parkway using an existing pedestrian tunnel and running the path between the parkway and Route 9W for about eight miles. The path would then cross back east under the parkway and finish its run on a long-abandoned spur of 9W. (Park officials say that only about five miles of the path are expected to require clearing the forest. The rest will run on already existing trails and roads.) But Michael T. Cullen, the landscape architect designing the trail, says the land between the two roadways is so full of obstacles -- rock outcroppings and wetlands -- that it would be impractical to build on it. "If we had to build a few miles of boardwalk through the wetlands, it would really blow our budget," he said. Another possibility involves running most if not all of the path between the parkway and the cliff, squeezing the Long Path and the bike path together at times. . Hikers worry that when the paths split in two, mountain bikers might choose to stay on the hiking trail. They are not welcome there. "We hope there would be strong guidance and enforcement to make the foot trail and the bike trail two separate uses," said JoAnn Dolan, executive director of the New York-New Jersey Trails Conference, a New-York based nonprofit group that manages more than 1,200 miles of hiking trails. Many local officials, including Lawrence Manus, the mayor of Alpine, home to about half of the proposed bikeway, are hoping the trail would draw a large number of cyclists off Route 9W. The road is a major training route for serious  cyclists from New York and New Jersey, and on weekends they sometimes ride three and four abreast. But Ira Wolfe, a teacher from North Bergen who was pedaling south along 9W Wednesday morning, said he doubted the bikers would budge. "The problem with bike paths is that they're too narrow for someone who's going  25 or 30 miles an hour," he said. Jeff Spicka, the bicycle and pedestrian coordinator for the Department of Transportation, agreed, saying the bike path would draw different users, particularly families out for leisurely rides. Or maybe you'd have Glen Pearson, an entertainment consultant from Washington Heights in Manhattan who stopped his mountain bike along River Road on Wednesday. Mr. Pearson said he had hiked the Long Path and would love to ride his bike there. "It's tranquil," he said. "You feel like you're in the woods. It's a real contrast with the city."</p>
