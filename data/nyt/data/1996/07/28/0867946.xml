        <p>With the first day of August falling on Thursday, summer is almost over. If you're a student with a summer job, that can be good news or bad news. We know how important these jobs are financially, and how they can provide valuable experiences to take back to school. But we want to hear about your summer job. Did you learn anything, or was it a waste of time? Send your story to On the Job, Money and Business, The New York Times, 229 West 43d Street, New York, N.Y. 10036.
