        <p>A third candidate has entered the field for the Republican nomination for Congress in the 19th District, but it remains unresolved if he will appear on the primary ballot on Sept. 10. The latest candidate is Jim Russell of Hawthorne, a computer network administrator with AT&amp;T in White Plains.</p>
        <p>But his nominating petitions are being challenged, a spokesman for the State Board of Elections said.</p>
        <p>The other candidates are the incumbent, Representative Sue W. Kelly of Katonah, and Joseph J. DioGuardi of Mount Pleasant, a former Westchester Congressman. Objections have also been filed with the Election Board to Mr. DioGuardi's nominating petitions on the Republican, Conservative and Right to Life lines, the spokesman said.</p>
        <p>The 19th Congressional District includes part of White Plains, northern Westchester County, Putnam County and parts of Dutchess and Orange Counties. Candidates often challenge the nominating petitions of opponents, because of the state's arcane election law, which allows signatures to be thrown out for what many people regard as trivial mistakes. For that reason candidates often seek many more than the required number of signatures.</p>
