        <p>Cecil Taylor Ensemble</p>
        <p>Meetings between jazz's true originals are often rocky, and there's a subgenre of fascinatingly flawed records documenting these misfirings. The Cecil Taylor Ensemble's "Always a Pleasure" isn't quite so much a dialogue as a capturing of two presences within the same tightly compressed septet: the pianist Cecil Taylor and the tenor saxophonist Charles Gayle. Mr. Gayle's powerful incantatory improvisations are inspired by John Coltrane, Sonny Rollins and Albert Ayler; Mr. Taylor's manner is fast and highly articulated, like Art Tatum's, and his most delicate moments are often his best.</p>
        <p>Both are nimble musicians, but Mr. Gayle's opening salvo in the high upper range is wearyingly long, and he undermines his own capacity to develop motives. This prompts dense chording from Mr. Taylor and a deadlock early on. Later, Mr.  Gayle leaves the high register behind, and by the final movement, he's shadowing Mr. Taylor with balladlike tones. As a Cecil Taylor-Charles Gayle album, it's a  disappointment; no wonder FMP, the German record label, waited three years to release it. But on other counts it succeeds: in its curious narrative flow, and  its inspired passages of interplay between Mr. Taylor and the cellist Tristan Honsinger.</p>
        <p>Oliver Lake Quintet</p>
        <p>For such a revered musician and composer, Eric Dolphy, who died in 1964, has  had amazingly few dedicated interpreters. The reason: his style on alto saxophone, bass clarinet and flute, poised between be-bop and abstraction with an alarming hustle through gaping intervals, achieved total specificity by technical brilliance. Its rhythms were related to Charlie Parker's, but in general it had no antecedent and suggested little beyond itself.  On "Dedicated  to Dolphy," the alto saxophonist Oliver Lake is one of the few musicians who have successfully blended Dolphy's style with their own. He has recorded Dolphy's material before, most notably in "The Prophet," an earlier tribute recording made for the same label, Black Saint, in 1980. Mr. Lake, a founding member of the World Saxophone Quartet, has his own sense of time and an urgent feel for the blues, folding Dolphyesque phrases into a relaxed, melismatic swing. This is less a high-concept updating of a formidable modernist composer than a solid, straightforward jazz record you could play at a Sunday barbecue. Accompanied by the young trumpeter Russell Gunn, Mr. Lake sounds blissfully comfortable with tricky Dolphy themes like "Miss Ann" and "G.W."; he has made them his own standards.</p>
        <p>Ron Miles</p>
        <p>A debut album by a young trumpeter from Denver, "My Cruel Heart" (Gramavision), is inspired jazz-rock fusion; if only the rest of the genre were  as tasteful.  Mr. Miles can't get enough of Miles Davis's slow cool, and if this is more limitation than specialization, he practices his one style with such a sense of purpose that for the moment it doesn't matter. (There's no shortage of  trumpet players in the opposite mold, the fast, rhythmically complex Clifford Brown style.) On "Finger Palace," while the drummer Rudy Royston and guitarists  Todd Ayers and Farrell Lowe work out terse funk grooves, Mr. Miles plays a sequence of disconnected mini-melodies tailing off into the fuzzed layers beneath, and the acoustic bassist Artie Moore plays a repeated fragment of a bass line. In "Say It Loud," the same burnished, slow-moving trumpet lines adorn a walloping speed-metal rhythm. Every track has a different organizing concept,  but this is no glib exercise in postmodernism: the ideas are integrated and compelling.</p>
