        <p>Cisco Systems Inc., a network-computing concern based in San Jose, Calif., agreed yesterday to acquire the Telebit Corporation and its modem ISDN channel aggregation, or MICA, technologies in a complicated transaction valued at about  $200 million. In total, Telebit shareholders would receive $13.35 a share. Telebit stock gained $1.9375, to $12.8125, in Nasdaq trading. Under the agreement, Telebit, a maker of data transmission products based in Chelmsford, Mass., would sell its analog modem business, Net Blazer and Mica Blazer products and certain other assets and liabilities to a new company formed through a management buyout for a $31.5 million promissory note and $3.5 million in redeemable preferred stock. Cisco would assume the $35 million financing for the management buyout.</p>
