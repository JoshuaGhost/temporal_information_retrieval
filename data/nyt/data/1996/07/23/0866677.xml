        <p>Officials of Ross Perot's national Reform Party movement have formally turned down a request from Richard D. Lamm's Presidential campaign for a list of the 1.3 million people who are eligible to take part in the candidate-preference survey and the August vote that will determine the nascent party's nominee.</p>
        <p>"Legal counsel cautions us that we cannot give that list to your campaign without exceeding a campaign contribution limitation," said Russell Verney, the  director of the Perot Reform Committee, in a July 19 letter to the campaign of Mr. Lamm, the former Governor of Colorado and Mr. Perot's only declared rival for the new party's nomination. "But, please note the petitions or voter registration rolls are on file in the states and are public documents."</p>

        <p>Officials of Ross Perot's national Reform Party movement have formally turned down a request from Richard D. Lamm's Presidential campaign for a list of the 1.3 million people who are eligible to take part in the candidate-preference survey and the August vote that will determine the nascent party's nominee.</p>
        <p>"Legal counsel cautions us that we cannot give that list to your campaign without exceeding a campaign contribution limitation," said Russell Verney, the  director of the Perot Reform Committee, in a July 19 letter to the campaign of Mr. Lamm, the former Governor of Colorado and Mr. Perot's only declared rival for the new party's nomination. "But, please note the petitions or voter registration rolls are on file in the states and are public documents."</p>
        <p>Mr. Verney's letter, the product of days of discussions between the rival camps last week, represents more than a disagreement over whether the list is a  public record, as the Lamm campaign asserts, or whether the data have a monetary value that exceeds the Federal limit of $1,000 for campaign contributions, as Mr. Verney contends.</p>
        <p>Rather, it is a billboard for two important though murky issues that have emerged since Mr. Perot's July 11 announcement that he was a candidate for the Presidential nomination of the national third party:</p>
        <p>* Can the Perot Reform Committee, which the Federal Election Commission classifies as a candidate's campaign committee but which Mr. Perot says is a party-building organization, simultaneously build a new party with a ballot line nationwide and run Mr. Perot's '96 campaign?</p>
        <p>* Do the two functions of the committee, which was founded and financed by Mr. Perot make it extremely difficult for any candidate whose last name is not Perot to compete for the third party's Presidential nomination?</p>
        <p>Tom D'Amore, a senior Lamm campaign adviser, said yesterday that his telephone discussions with Mr. Verney about access to the supporters' list left  him in a quandry.</p>
        <p>"When I pick up the phone," Mr. D'Amore said, "am I talking to Russell Verney, campaign manager for Ross Perot, or am I talking to Russell Verney," who directs the effort to get the Reform Party on the ballot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verney said yesterday that he saw no conflict between the Perot Reform Committee's two roles.</p>
        <p>"They are one and the same right now," he said. "At the point where all 50 states have political parties, they will create a national committee to govern national operations."</p>
        <p>Asked whether that national committee will be created at either the Aug. 11 or Aug. 18 sessions of the party's national nominating convention, Mr. Verney said no decision had been made.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verney said the Lamm campaign could obtain the supporters' list one of two ways. Its representatives could go to the secretaries of state nationwide, copy the names and addresses of those who signed ballot-access petitions or enrolled in the party, and enter the material into a computer for a mail list or a phone bank. Or, they can go to the mailing list company, Berlin Industries, in Illinois, and hire it to reach Reform Party supporters on Mr. Lamm's behalf.</p>
        <p>From the Lamm campaign's perspective, Mr. Verney and officials of the Perot Reform Committee have confused proprietary information, like internal campaign polling data or a magazine subscription list, with data that are a matter of public record and in the public domain.</p>
        <p>"I don't think the list has a dollar value," Mr. D'Amore said. All the Lamm campaign should have to do, he said, is to pay for the cost of making a copy of  the data.</p>
        <p>If one candidate has easy access to voters in a primary and the opponent does not, he said, "that's a distinct disadvantage, to put it politely."</p>
        <p>Because they had insufficient information with which to evaluate the dispute  over the list and the list's purported value, neither the Federal Election Commission nor the Republican National Committee wanted to hazard a position yesterday.</p>
        <p>Sharon Snyder, an election commission spokeswoman, said anything that has a dollar value -- money or equipment, for example -- is a campaign contribution or contribution in kind. But the commission has rarely been asked to determine the  market value of a list, Ms. Snyder said.</p>
        <p>Mary Crawford, a press secretary for the Republican National Committee, said  that during the national Presidential primaries the party did not provide any candidate with campaign tools, like voter lists. Emphasizing that she could not  evaluate the Perot-Lamm dispute, Ms. Crawford said the Republican National Committee could make available to those who request it the party's Federal Election Commission report, which includes names of contributors, without running afoul of a campaign contribution limit because the same data are available from the commission itself.</p>
        <p>In other developments yesterday, the Perot Reform Committee released a list indicating that it had mailed candidate preference surveys to 979,882 of the new party's estimated 1.3 million supporters. But the committee's own tally indicates that in several populous states -- Indiana, Michigan, North Carolina,  Ohio and Texas among them -- many supporters have yet to receive surveys.</p>
