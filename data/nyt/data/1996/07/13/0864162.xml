        <p>While Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls completed a huge deal yesterday, the Knicks' Anthony Mason-for-Larry Johnson trade remained on hold, probably until Monday.</p>
        <p>Jordan agreed to a one-year contract with the Bulls believed to be worth $25  million, which would be the largest one-year contract in the history of team sports.</p>
        <p>The league's most valuable player last season became the first big-name free agent to sign, but others are expected to follow within the next week.</p>
        <p>As for the Knicks, their trade with the Hornets, which would send Mason and Brad Lohaus to Charlotte in exchange for Johnson, was expected to be announced Monday. But league rules prohibit Johnson from waiving $800,000 of his signing bonus, although he has agreed to do so. If Johnson does not waive that bonus, it will diminish the Knicks' salary-cap room, leaving them with less money to pursue free agents. They are in hot pursuit of several, most notably Detroit's Allan Houston and Indiana's Reggie Miller. The Knicks think Johnson's acquisition would make them even more attractive to free agents. The Knicks are  looking for a way to make the Johnson deal in a way that leaves them as much salary-cap room as possible.</p>
        <p>The only way the Johnson deal could fall through would be if the Los Angeles  Clippers came up with a last-minute offer that the Hornets felt they could not refuse.</p>
        <p>The Pacers can outbid the Knicks for Miller, but the Pistons might not be willing to pay Houston more than Grant Hill. So the Knicks were expected to make a strong run at Houston, a 25-year-old shooting guard who averaged 19.7 points last season. The Pistons would rather wait to sign Houston, leaving them room to pursue free agents like Juwan Howard, Chris Childs and perhaps Dikembe Mutombo.  If the Knicks made a strong offer to Houston quickly, he might be enticed to leave.</p>
        <p>The Knicks still need a veteran point guard, assuming they do not re-sign the free agent Derek Harper. One league executive said yesterday that Gary Payton was close to re-signing with the Seattle SuperSonics for seven years and about $77 million. "Seattle has first crack," said Aaron Goodwin, Payton's agent.</p>
        <p>If the Knicks cannot get Payton, they may target Childs, or try to deal for Rod Strickland, who wants to leave Portland. Meanwhile, the Bullets were believed to be offering Howard a seven-year, $75 million deal, but the Miami Heat remained interested in him as well.</p>
        <p>Jordan's signing with the Bulls was expected, but the length of the deal, and the speed of the negotiations, were surprises. Like Chicago Coach Phil Jackson,  Jordan signed a one-year deal, meaning he will be a free agent again next season. But the one-year deal gives Jordan the freedom to re-evaluate his career after next season. Jordan will turn 34 in February, and he might not want to play after this contract expires, particularly if Jackson leaves and if the Bulls do not repeat as champions.</p>
        <p>"This team could have a good chance of winning the championship again," Jordan said. "Then after that, you don't know. They may want to take a business  approach to it and change the team. And I want to give them the flexibility to do that."</p>
        <p>If Jordan leaves after next season, the Bulls would have more room under the  salary cap to pursue free agents for 1997-98.</p>
        <p>"Michael asked for a one-year contract because he never wants to play if he is unable to meet his own high standards," said Jerry Reinsdorf, the Bulls' owner, in a statement released by the team. "This way, Michael and the Bulls will be able to discuss what is appropriate after each subsequent season."</p>
        <p>The deal was done via conference call, with Reinsdorf in Chicago, Jordan's lawyer, David Falk, in Washington and Jordan in Lake Tahoe, Nev., at a golf tournament. According to Reinsdorf, "Once we were able to speak, the total elapsed time of our phone calls was less than one hour."</p>
        <p>Jordan, who makes an estimated $40 million a year from endorsements, made about $4 million in salary last year. Patrick Ewing was paid $18.7 million by the Knicks last season as part of a contract that will play him $3 million in 1996-97.</p>
        <p>Jordan's contract becomes the standard by which other free agent contracts will be measured. The free agent who may sign the second-richest deal is Orlando's Shaquille O'Neal, who will consider offers from both the Los Angeles Lakers and the Magic. The Lakers were expected to make a seven-year, $96 million offer to O'Neal, while Orlando was expected to offer between $15 million and $17 million per season.</p>
        <p>While many expect Miller to stay with Indiana, he said yesterday that nothing had been decided. "It's still pretty much at a standstill," said Miller, who talked last week about his interest in joining the Knicks.</p>
