        <p>Today it probably wouldn't be worth more than a PG-13 rating (if even that),  but in 1955, the "Moon glow" and "torn shirt" sequences from the movie "Picnic"  were about as steamy as Hollywood could get in evoking explosive sex.</p>
        <p>In Joshua Logan's film version of the popular William Inge play, the sight of Kim Novak and William Holden eyeing each other like pieces of raw meat as they stepped out to slow-dance at a pavilion while friends and neighbors enviously ogled them was considered extremely provocative. The mystique of the virginal blond beauty helplessly drawn to the irresistible hunk had never been so plainly depicted in an American film.</p>

        <p>Today it probably wouldn't be worth more than a PG-13 rating (if even that),  but in 1955, the "Moon glow" and "torn shirt" sequences from the movie "Picnic"  were about as steamy as Hollywood could get in evoking explosive sex.</p>
        <p>In Joshua Logan's film version of the popular William Inge play, the sight of Kim Novak and William Holden eyeing each other like pieces of raw meat as they stepped out to slow-dance at a pavilion while friends and neighbors enviously ogled them was considered extremely provocative. The mystique of the virginal blond beauty helplessly drawn to the irresistible hunk had never been so plainly depicted in an American film.</p>
        <p>Picnic," which opens today at the Film Forum in a restored 35-millimeter color print, is set in a sleepy Kansas town over a Labor Day weekend. When Hal Carter (Holden), an itinerant, swaggering piece of beefcake, drifts into the vicinity, every female heart goes pitter-patter.</p>
        <p>Even though the actor was a little too old and a bit too smooth for the role, which Ralph Meeker had originated on Broadway (and which Marlon Brando should have played on the screen), he exuded enough magnetism to carry it off. And Ms.  Novak as Madge, the restless town beauty who drops the local rich boy (Cliff Robertson) to run off with Hal, personified dreamy 1950's prom-queen lushness.</p>
        <p>Rosalind Russell is vividly scary as an older schoolteacher who foolishly lunges after Hal. Betty Field is just right as Madge's wistful, once-beautiful mother, who years earlier ran away with a man like Hal, and Susan Strasberg does well in the role of Madge's shrill, tomboyish younger sister.</p>
        <p>George Duning's wistful, Copland-influenced score captures the mood of heated yearning that not only engulfed the movie, but also defined the country's romantic ethos in the mid-50's. And the hit "Moonglow and Theme From Picnic," to which Madge and Hal struck sparks, remains one of the most seductively sultry pop instrumentals ever recorded.</p>
        <p>Here is America at the height of the Eisenhower era, stewing in erotic fantasies that became more obsessive the more they remained unacted out.</p>
        <p>"Picnic" will be shown today through Aug. 1 at the Film Forum, 209 West Houston  Street, South Village. Tickets are $8. Information: (212) 727-8110.</p>
