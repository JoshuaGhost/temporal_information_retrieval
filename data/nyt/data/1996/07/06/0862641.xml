        <p>The chances that Gail Devers will win her first Olympic gold medal in the 100-meter hurdles instantly grew slimmer yesterday when the Russian Olympic committee agreed to let Lyudmila Engquist compete for Sweden.</p>
        <p>Engquist, formerly Lyudmila Narozhilenko, was the world hurdles champion in 1991 when she was representing the Soviet Union. But in February 1993, after testing positive for steroids, she was banned from the sport for four years.</p>
        <p>Her estranged husband, Nikolai Narozhilenko, later admitted to planting the  steroids in her protein powder. After considerable legal wrangling, her suspension was lifted by the International Amateur Athletic Federation last December.</p>
        <p>Engquist, 32, returned to the track this spring and has performed brilliantly, recording the year's fastest time of 12.52 seconds in Madrid last month and again in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Wednesday. Last night in Oslo, she  won the 100 hurdles at the Bislett Games in a wind-aided 12.48 seconds. Devers's best time this year was 12.62, at the Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>"I think my chances are very good in Atlanta," Engquist said by telephone from Norway. "But we all know Devers can be very good in the Olympics. She is always very good in very big competitions. She is home, so for sure it will be easier."</p>
        <p>Until yesterday afternoon, it was uncertain whether Engquist would join Devers at the Summer Games in Atlanta. She received Swedish citizenship on June  25, and because of International Olympic Committee regulations, the Russian Olympic committee needed to give its approval. The Olympic charter states that athletes who have competed for one nation must wait three years after acquiring  citizenship to compete for another. But if both countries' Olympic committees agree, that requirement is waived.</p>
        <p>"It took longer than we wanted to get approval from the Russian side," said Johan Engquist, Lyudmila's new husband and manager. "But they are good sportsmen in the federation there, and it was an obvious decision. The Olympics should have the best athletes."</p>
        <p>Devers and Engquist were supposed to duel for Olympic gold in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992, but Engquist strained a hamstring and withdrew from the semifinals. In the final, Devers, already the 100-meter sprint champion, was in  command until she clipped the final hurdle and fell. She finished fifth.</p>
        <p>Devers's main competition last year came from Olga Shishigina of Kazakhstan,  but Shishigina was banned for four years after testing positive for a steroid in May.</p>
