        <p>BACK on a rainy February night, a summer trip through France based on stays in maisons d'hotes, private houses that receive guests, seemed like a great idea.

        <p>Three of us -- a photographer, an antiques dealer and a writer -- decided to  try out the newest development in French tourism. Over the last 10 years, the privacy-loving French, among them rural aristocrats and Parisian widows, have opened their doors and their spare bedrooms to tourists who want to save money and get to know the country more intimately.

        <p>BACK on a rainy February night, a summer trip through France based on stays in maisons d'hotes, private houses that receive guests, seemed like a great idea. It was a joy to riffle through the pages of an alluring little guidebook called "Maisons d'Hotes de Charme en France," which lists 382 bed-and-breakfasts throughout the French countryside.</p>
        <p>Three of us -- a photographer, an antiques dealer and a writer -- decided to  try out the newest development in French tourism. Over the last 10 years, the privacy-loving French, among them rural aristocrats and Parisian widows, have opened their doors and their spare bedrooms to tourists who want to save money and get to know the country more intimately. This is a startling development in  a nation where people rarely invite anyone but their relatives and closest friends to dinner.</p>
        <p>We wanted to make a 10-day trip, first traveling west to Brittany from Paris, and then heading south through the Dordogne, the Gers section of Gascony  and finally Provence. The challenge was to pick four maisons d'hotes along the route, judged for location, regional architectural style and, more elusively, the warm welcome of the hosts. My traveling companions and I studied the postage-stamp-size pictures and carefully read the 100-word blurbs, looking for  hints, avoiding places described as very rustic and searching for the owners described as very welcoming. Phrases like,"A rather reserved welcome" were enough to eliminate several.</p>
        <p>After phone calls were made, faxes sent and deposits mailed, it was time to start worrying. A magazine article on French bed-and-breakasts mentioned the sniffiness of certain proprietors when asked for something as simple as a cup of tea, an acquaintance told of being given a dangerous horse by a household member unhappy at having to receive strangers on the ancestral turf, and a fax arrived from one owner to tell us that he had completely muddled the reservations.</p>
        <p>By the time the three of us were speeding toward Brittany on a showery June afternoon, I was wondering why we hadn't just contented ourselves with country inns. Did we really want to get to know the French that well? After a half-day's drive we were driving up a narrow lane bordered with Queen Anne's lace and hollyhocks to our first stop, a Breton manor house called Kerguereon, in the verdant countryside south of the town of Lannion.</p>
        <p>A few minutes after we parked the car in front of a sturdy, L-shaped stone house, our first owner, Gerard de Bellefon, appeared through a stone archway. A  tall, handsome man, dressed for gardening, he greeted us warmly and showed us into the house, through the antique-filled living room and up the stairs to the  two spacious rooms available to guests. An antique armoire, richly colored tablecloths, a pair of single beds pushed together, fresh flowers, family photographs and books about Brittany added up to a warmly personal atmosphere. The bathrooms were small, spotless and functional, equipped with bathtubs and hand-held showers.</p>
        <p>Although some maisons d'hotes offer the option of dining at home, Kerguereon  did not. Instead, Gerard de Bellefon, whose English was excellent, and his wife, Odette, offered us a drink and then suggested that we dine at Les Cotes d'Armor, in the coastal town of Plestin-les-Greves, where we feasted on Breton artichokes and local seafood.</p>
        <p>The next morning at 8:30, a time we had specified the night before, we sat down for breakfast in the family dining room. Coffee in a silver pot, a pitcher  of hot milk, baskets of warm toast and croissants, five kinds of homemade jam and, best of all, a pile of homemade crepes were laid out for us.</p>
        <p>After breakfast, Mr. de Bellefon helped us plan our day of touring the region. Without him, we might not have seen the cloister at Treguier, a delicately carved example of flamboyant Gothic architecture, or the 15th-century castle of La Roche-Jagu, which offered not only a lovely view down the Trieux River but an amusing exhibition about turn-of-the-century trains. The next day,  our host insisted we stop at the enclos paroissiaux (parish closes), uniquely Breton religious monuments filled with lively humanistic statues, at St.-Thegonnec and Guimiliau. He also recommended several chateaus in the countryside. When we told Mr. de Bellefon that we had arrived a few minutes too  late to visit the Chateau de Rosanbo, he took us to visit a friend's castle, a classic example of austere Breton architecture.</p>
        <p>WE had to leave at dawn on a Sunday morning. In a final gesture of thoughtfulness, Mrs. de Bellefon set up a do-it-yourself breakfast on the table, complete with a toaster and an electric kettle.</p>
        <p>So far, so good. We headed south, making a long day's drive to the Perigord,  aiming for a chateau called Cazenac, perched on a hill overlooking the Dordogne  River about 12 miles from Sarlat. We turned onto smaller and smaller roads, taking smug satisfaction as we ignored the sign saying Private Road. At the top  of the hill lay an enchanting castle, complete with sunny, ocher-colored walls,  a round, ivy-covered tower and a wrought-iron gate entwined with climbing roses.</p>
        <p>Here, the young welcoming couple were Philippe and Armelle Constant, who left their jobs in Paris as an art dealer and art restorer, respectively, when Cazenac, which had once belonged to her family, came on the market. They redecorated the chateau, which was built during the 15th through 18th centuries, mixing modern art and antique furniture in a happy, eclectic style. Each of the  six bedrooms is different, from the romantic eccentricity of a room with an old-fashioned footed bathtub at one end to the charm of the pink room, where the double bed offers a view of the countryside. In every case, the tiled bathrooms were large and modern. The rooms had telephones, an exception to the usual rule in maisons d'hotes.</p>
        <p>The first night we dined with the family, eating Perigordine specialties like tourain, a soup of bread and greens, and duck breast, with a quivering creme caramel for dessert and a red wine from Bergerac. It was delicious, although, at about $50 each (at five francs to the dollar), not inexpensive for the region. During dinner, Mr. Constant asked us what we were interested in doing the next day. Antiques and second-hand stores, said the dealer. Scenic villages, said the photographer. Prehistoric cave paintings, said the writer.</p>
        <p>THE next morning at breakfast (toast, croissants, orange juice, gooseberries  and raspberries from the garden) he presented us with a neatly typed itinerary,  suggesting that we start by reserving spaces at Font de Baume, one of the rare places in France one can see authentic cave paintings rather than copies as at the better-known Lascaux II. He concentrated on places within about 15 miles, so that we didn't spend too much time in the car and had time to discover things on our own, like the fully furnished Renaissance Chateau de Losse and the tiny riverside town of St.-Leon-sur-Vezere. A swim in Cazenac's pool and dinner outdoors at a nearby restaurant concluded the day.</p>
        <p>We regretted not having scheduled more days at Cazenac, but we made a leisurely half-day's drive headed south to the untouristed department of the Gers, an area known for foie gras, Armagnac and castles isolated in the rolling  countryside of Gascony. In the late afternoon, we turned off the straight road that runs between Agen and Montauban and parked in front of a handsome farmhouse, where we were greeted by an impressive giant schnauzer. After knocking several times, we opened the door and called out, "Bonjour, bonjour?"</p>
        <p>After a few moments, one of the owners, Yveline Morel, appeared, looking a bit distracted by the demands of her young son.  She showed us two rooms, one spacious and beautifully furnished, one tiny and plain. When we protested, she showed us a third room, this one as large and well-furnished as the first.</p>
        <p>Although I had said on the telephone back in February that we would like to eat at home the first night, they were clearly not expecting us for dinner. Mrs. Morel and her husband, Thierry, made several phone calls to local restaurants, many of which turned out to be closed. Eventually we ended up at a simple cafe in the nearby town of Mauvezin, where the cook arrived from her garden across the street to whip up a menu that started with bright green nettle soup, a bland-tasting gastronomic curiosity that is understandably rare.</p>
        <p>The next morning, the dining room table at La Chaviniere was set with cheerful flowered yellow plates, and the breakfast included orange juice, stewed apples, bread and croissants. As we ate, Mrs. Morel gave us precise, helpful suggestions for our day in Toulouse, about 40 miles away, listing the best antiques shops and restaurants and even the most convenient parking lot. It also became clear that although we could have dinner there, the whole family was really eager to attend a child's theatrical performance that night. We left our  return time vague, with the result that we returned from a long day to find everyone gone and the doors locked. Unshowered, we headed off to nearby Beaumont de Lomagne to eat foie gras in the dowdy Hotel de Commerce, feeling a bit miffed that we had not thought to ask for a key or that one had not been offered.</p>
        <p>The next morning, however, breakfast was both delicious and convivial, with good touring advice being handed out as generously as toast and jam. The Morels, both Belgians, told us that the house had originally been the country residence  of a prominent Toulouse family. When they purchased it, in 1990, they had to renovate it entirely, including the installation of seven bathrooms in a house that had none. Although their original welcome had seemed a bit random, we left  on a cheerful note, with greater knowledge of one of the least-populated regions of France. One caveat, however, about La Chaviniere: although the rooms were beautifully decorated, one can only hope that the Morels will replace the most aggressively lumpy beds of our tour.</p>
        <p>Then we headed east a few hours, speeding along the autoroute through Languedoc, stopping only briefly to take a picture of Carcassonne's impressive ramparts. As the shadows of the cypress trees lengthened, we turned into a driveway with a hand-painted sign announcing Le Mas de l'Ange, in the flat countryside east of St.-Remy-de-Provence.</p>
        <p>AT first glance, the house of the angel was something of a disappointment. Spoiled by our chateaus and manor houses, we were a little snooty about the suburban aspect of the pink stucco building surrounded by lawns and gardens. We  were greeted casually by the owner, Bruno Lafforgue, who showed us our rooms and then went off to ride the handsome gray horse stabled next to the house. Inside, the house was a colorful, eccentric collage of objects evidently bought from second-hand furniture dealers in nearby L'Isle-sur-la-Sorgue -- huge ceramic jars, clothing, quilts, and fabrics old and new draped casually over the furniture and the windows. The upstairs bedrooms, each with its own color scheme, were small, as were the bathrooms.</p>
        <p>We contemplated searching for grander lodgings, but it was already early evening.  Finally someone said, "We'll stay, and perhaps the demented charm will get through to us." Mr. Lafforgue suggested a small restaurant, Ou Ravi Provencau, in the town of Maussane-les-Alpilles, where we had one of the best dinners of our trip. We came home, climbed the stairs and fell into the most comfortable beds of our tour, falling asleep to the roar of the mistral and the  guttural chorus of frogs.</p>
        <p>In the bright light of a summer morning, the rooms, though small, did have charm. One, the white room, was accessorized with quirky items like old linen smocks on hangers against the wall, a primitive model of a building, a cream-colored pitcher and an ascension balloon shaped of chicken wire. Downstairs, breakfast was self-service. Big thermoses of coffee, hot milk and water, bread, croissants, jams and orange juice awaited on the dining room table, to be shared with our fellow guests, an Australian couple and a French television crew. (The only other guests we shared a house with were a honeymooning couple one night at Cazenac.)</p>
        <p>We filled our days with visits to antiques shops, which are plentiful and of  good quality in this area, walks through Arles's lively Saturday market and ancient Roman buildings and a brief hike through the touristy town of Les Baux de Provence.</p>
        <p>Back at Le Mas de l'Ange, our host had excellent restaurant recommendations,  including Sous les Micocouliers in nearby Eygalieres, where we dined on Provencal specialties on a tree-shaded terrace. Three days passed rapidly, and,  by the time they were over, we were almost sorry to leave the Mas de l'Ange, which lacked grandeur but had plenty of personality.</p>
        <p>And that was what made this trip extraordinary. The contrasts among the four  places we stayed were so marked, the personalities of the owners so individual that even a small hotel would have seemed standardized in comparison. Although guests lead a separate life from the family, each house offers a glimpse of daily life in France. Every owner clearly wanted us to enjoy our stay in their area, and their advice enabled even non-French speakers to take their noses out  of the guidebooks and waft along on the good counsel of the locals.</p>
        <p>House hunting</p>
        <p>Planning</p>
        <p>We used the French-language guidebook "Maisons d'Hotes de Charme en France,"  published by Rivages, available only in France, to plan our trip. The English translation, "Bed and Breakfasts of Charm and Character in France," published by Fodor's ($17), captures both the sense and the tone of the French book. Confirm all reservations, including meals, by letter or fax; if a deposit is required, you can purchase a draft in French francs from a bank.</p>
        <p>You might augment the book's excellent regional maps with a road map of the whole country -- or the regions that interest you -- to plan a trip from one bed-and-breakfast to the next. Our trip from northern Brittany to the Dordogne was too long and didn't allow for any leisurely stops. Trips no more than about  200 miles apart would have worked out better.</p>
        <p>You may be surprised at the amount of local sightseeing that your hosts will  suggest, two or three days' worth. Although there's no rule that you can't hang  around the house all day, the underlying assumption seems to be that you will go out during the day, leaving the family to pursue their own lives; in any case, lunch is rarely an option.</p>
