        <p>One man was killed and another critically wounded in a shooting outside a bar in the Howard Beach section of Queens last night, the police said.</p>
        <p>Several bystanders said the deceased victim was an off-duty firefighter, but  neither police, fire nor Emergency Medical Services officials would confirm his  occupation.</p>
        <p>The shooting occurred outside the Cactus Bar and Grill, at 163-34 Cross Bay  Boulevard, at 7:20 P.M., said Officer Kathleen Kelly, a Police Department spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Officer Kelly said the circumstances surrounding the shooting were unclear but that it seemed to stem from an earlier dispute between the victims and the suspects. The police would only confirm that there was more than one suspect.</p>
        <p>Officer Kelly said the suspects, who remained at large, left the bar after the dispute, then went back and shot the victims, who were both 34 years old.</p>
        <p>She added that the man who was killed had been shot in the back.</p>
        <p>The other victim, whose name was also not released, was taken to Jamaica Hospital in Queens, where he was being treated for gunshot wounds to the abdomen and arm.</p>
        <p>A man who answered the telephone at the Cactus Bar and Grill refused to give  out any information on about the shooting.</p>
