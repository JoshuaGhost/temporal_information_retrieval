        <p>When customers enter Edie's Lunchonette in Little Silver, N.J., they're in for more than a tasty breakfast or lunch. A trip down memory lane is also included, a journey that goes back to the last century.</p>
        <p>The refurbished wooden building that houses the eatery was built about 1889  (according to available records) for use as a general store and post office and  became a full-time restaurant in 1930. The dining area provides customers with the old-style charm of wooden floors, pew-like booths, a soda fountain counter and stained glass.</p>

        <p>When customers enter Edie's Lunchonette in Little Silver, N.J., they're in for more than a tasty breakfast or lunch. A trip down memory lane is also included, a journey that goes back to the last century.</p>
        <p>The refurbished wooden building that houses the eatery was built about 1889  (according to available records) for use as a general store and post office and  became a full-time restaurant in 1930. The dining area provides customers with the old-style charm of wooden floors, pew-like booths, a soda fountain counter and stained glass.</p>
        <p>Hardy morning and midday meals are served at Edie's, with an array of omelets that are much in demand. A chalkboard menu above the counter is filled with interesting omelet options including jelly, porkroll, and vegetable fillings.</p>
        <p>A decision about the numerous choices is made somewhat easier by the popular Garbage Omelet. What's in it? Bacon, onions, green pepper, cheeses and other ingredients summed up by a notation on the menu as "all of the above."</p>
        <p>The result is a plump omelet that is barely contained on a large plate. The  order includes Edie's Fries--waffle fries cooked in canoloa oil and amazingly grease-free-- in addition to toast and a cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>Those who frequently dine at Edie's, along with the staff, always keep an eye out for the boss. Not Lori Pappas who manages the business (named after Edie Bacigalupi, a previous owner), but the Boss himself, the musician Bruce Springsteen, who lives nearby and is a frequent customer. However, diners sang the praises of Edie's long before Springsteen arrived on the scene.</p>
        <p>EDIE'S LUNCHEONETTE, 164 Rumson Road, Little Silver, N.J. (908) 842-9647. Hours: 6 A.M. to 3 P.M. Monday through Friday; 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. Saturday.</p>
