        <p>Here are some favorite Brahms recordings of the classical-music critics of The New York Times. Compact disks range in price from $10 to $18, for a single CD, to $25 to $32, for a double set, to $60 for a six-CD set; single tape cassettes cost from $5 to $11. (An introduction appears on page C1.)</p>
        <p>STRING SEXTETS (OPP. 18, 36).  Isaac Stern and Cho-Liang Lin, violinists; Jaime Laredo and Michael Tree, violists; Yo-Yo Ma and Sharon Robinson, cellists (Sony Classical S2K 45820; two CD's).</p>
        <p>''GERMAN REQUIEM.''  Arleen Auger, soprano; Richard Stilwell, baritone; Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, conducted by Robert Shaw (Telarc 80092; CD).</p>
        <p>CHORAL WORKS.  Westminster Choir, conducted by Joseph Flummerfelt (Delos DE 3193; CD).</p>
        <p>SONGS.  Anne Sofie von Otter, mezzo-soprano; Bengt Forsberg, pianist (Deutsche Grammophon 429 727-2; CD).</p>
        <p>CONCERTOS FOR VIOLIN, FOR VIOLIN AND CELLO.  Gidon Kremer, violinist; Mischa Maisky, cellist; Vienna Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Bernstein (Deutsche Grammophon 431 031-2; CD)</p>
        <p>THE absence of the two string sextets from most accountings of Brahms's greatest achievements strikes me as an extraordinary oversight. Ardent, tuneful, texturally rich and packed with attention-grabbing harmonic twists, these works ought to be considered crown jewels of the chamber repertory. An all-star ensemble -- Isaac Stern, Cho-Liang Lin, Jaime Laredo, Michael Tree, Yo-Yo Ma and Sharon Robinson -- conveys their dark, lush beauty without succumbing to the temptation of lugubriousness. Emanuel Ax's lovely account of the Theme and Variations from Opus 18, in Brahms's solo piano arrangement, is an appealing enhancement.</p>

        <p>THE absence of the two string sextets from most accountings of Brahms's greatest achievements strikes me as an extraordinary oversight. Ardent, tuneful, texturally rich and packed with attention-grabbing harmonic twists, these works ought to be considered crown jewels of the chamber repertory. An all-star ensemble -- Isaac Stern, Cho-Liang Lin, Jaime Laredo, Michael Tree, Yo-Yo Ma and Sharon Robinson -- conveys their dark, lush beauty without succumbing to the temptation of lugubriousness. Emanuel Ax's lovely account of the Theme and Variations from Opus 18, in Brahms's solo piano arrangement, is an appealing enhancement.</p>
        <p>In his ''German Requiem,'' Brahms replaced the traditional Requiem text with a calculatedly nonsectarian compilation of biblical verses in which the notion of divine wrath is abandoned in favor of a more comforting vision of the afterlife. Robert Shaw's soft-edged, expansively paced reading of this humanist masterwork with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, Arleen Auger and Richard Stilwell offers graceful choral singing and an irresistible emotional resonance. A brisker, more dramatic and equally eloquent alternative is Kurt Masur's recent recording with the New York Philharmonic, the Westminster Symphonic Choir, Sylvia McNair and Hakan Hagegard on Teldec.</p>
        <p>The Westminster singers also offer a glimpse of Brahms's homier side on ''Singing for Pleasure,'' a Delos collection of mostly secular choral works. Among them are robustly sung selections from the ''Liebeslieder Waltzes,'' characterful renderings of five of the ''Zigeunerlieder'' and three German folk songs, and a sublime performance of the motet ''O Heiland, Reiss die Himmel Auf'' (Op. 74, No. 2).</p>
        <p>As a composer of art songs, Brahms has taken a back seat to Schubert and Schumann, yet he was by no means an inferior vocal composer. Anne Sofie von Otter's lieder album includes two dozen items that range from folk songs and more of the ''Zigeunerlieder'' to ''Wiegenlied'' (Op. 49, No. 4), the famous lullaby, and the haunting Ruckert and Lope de Vega settings of Op. 91. Ms. von Otter has a flexible, interestingly textured mezzo-soprano and the interpretive sensitivity to make the brighter songs come alive and to touch a deeply sympathetic chord in the more introspective ones.</p>
        <p>The intimate songs are the polar opposites of the blockbuster concertos, but both forms allow a soloist with a strong personality to make a bold mark. Gidon Kremer, in his idiosyncratic 1983 recording of the Violin Concerto with Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic, replaces the standard Joachim cadenza with a Reger prelude and reshapes the work in other ways. Mischa Maisky joins the team for an equally individualistic account of the ''Double Concerto'' on the same disk.</p>
