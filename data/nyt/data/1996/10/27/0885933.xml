        <p>AMONG the shoppers and browsers at the Ossining Farmers Market one recent Saturday morning were Sean and Rosa Villalobos, a young couple from Thornwood. They were making their first visit to this community's popular gathering spot.</p>
        <p>Friends had recommended the market, and now the Villaloboses were heading home with several bags filled with chickens, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, apples and plums.</p>
        <p>''Everything looks so fresh -- we bought as much as we could carry,'' Mrs. Villalobos said. ''Also, I'm expecting our second child, so we're trying to eat lots of healthy foods.''</p>
        <p>Nearby, Anita Woolf was finishing her shopping and about to return to Bob's Army and Navy Store across the street, a business she helped her husband, Robert, start 50 years ago.</p>
        <p>Observing that the farmers' market ''has brought a lot of people into the downtown area,'' Mrs. Woolf added: ''The market gives you a small-town feeling. I just wish it was here two days a week.''</p>
        <p>Now in its sixth season, the Ossining Farmers Market is proving successful in several ways. It has a growing reputation as a place where a wide variety of farm-fresh products and other homemade items can be found, and, in turn, the vendors have been pleased by another year of increased sales.</p>
        <p>The bustle up and down Main Street from 10 A.M. to 1 P.M. as customers drive and walk to the market is also a promising step toward the revitalization of the downtown here, a goal sought by the market's organizers.</p>
        <p>Just a block from Route 9, the market is, in a sense, a revival of a similar endeavor sponsored by Ossining's Department of Community Development nearly 20 years ago.</p>
        <p>Natalie Mackintosh, Assistant Village Manager here from 1976 to 1993, said that the earlier market received scant support from community leaders and fizzled out in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>''The market day was Thursday, and it was run in a very casual manner,'' Mrs. Mackintosh said. ''The charge to the farmers was $1 for the day, which many people felt wasn't fair to local businesses.''</p>
        <p>Miriam Haas, the organizer and manager of the current Ossining Farmers Market, first sought to  make organic produce available at existing stores. Having moved here in 1987 with her husband and 3-year-old daughter, Ms. Haas soon joined a local chapter of Families for Safe Food, a consumer-advocacy group.</p>
        <p>''But we were unsuccessful in getting organic fruits and vegetables into supermarkets,'' Ms. Haas said. ''So I started the market with the idea that at least fresh produce would be as close to organic as possible.''</p>
        <p>With a few hundred dollars of her own money, Ms. Haas opened the new market with two farmstands. Two years later she affiliated with the Open Space Institute to get nonprofit status, and with each season new vendors joined.</p>
        <p>''This market has come a long way,'' said Edmund Barry, owner of Froehlich Farms in Montgomery, N.Y., and a vendor at the Ossining Farmers Market since its revival. ''The increase in business at this market from the beginning until now has been dramatic.''</p>
        <p>Richard Biezynski, a newcomer to the market who raises poultry in Tivoli, N.Y., said: ''Every weekend the volume of products that I sell increases. Usually I'm sold out of chickens by 11:30 A.M. and could be gone by 1 o'clock, but I hang around to let people know that I'll be here each week.''</p>
        <p>The vendors are charged $30 to $45 a week to rent their spaces, depending on size, and they also pay the village $20 for a yearly vending license. The vendors must also carry $1 million in liability insurance.</p>
        <p>Money raised from vendors' rent and a membership program helps defray costs for publicity and advertising, printing, fund-raising programs and mailings. Funds left over at the end of the year are taken by Ms. Haas as a consulting fee, although she acknowledged that her efforts do not result in substantial gain.</p>
        <p>Instead, Ms. Haas said: ''I simply get enjoyment from seeing people here at the market talking to each other, sharing recipes, relaxing. They are in a better mood when they shop outdoors. I feel that this basic way of shopping, reminiscent of earlier days, taps into something really deep.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Mackintosh said, ''Miriam Haas has devoted a lot of time to the Ossining Farmers Market, which is why it works.''</p>
        <p>In the spring Ms. Haas started two other farmers markets -- one in Brewster behind the town library and the other at the northbound Plattekill rest stop on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway near Newburgh. So, while Ms. Haas has spent her Saturdays since June overseeing the budding operation of the Brewster market, which already has five vendors, her husband, Jon Zeltsman, has run the show in Ossining.</p>
        <p>''It's a neat job,'' Mr. Zeltsman said. ''I do everything that a community resident ordinarily would do when they go to the market and that is meet my friends and neighbors.''</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Haas and Mr. Zeltsman are modest about the amount of work they put into organizing and promoting the market, their ability to present special programs and activities is one of the more noticeable aspects of the Ossining Farmers Market. Some of the highlights this year were a pancake breakfast, which opened the new season, a corn roast last month and a series of appearances by local ''celebrity'' chefs to demonstrate their culinary skills.</p>
        <p>''Events like the chefs' cook-off are a way of attracting a broader-base clientele for the market as well as emphasizing all of our gems here,'' said Lucia Alcantara, the newly hired downtown manager at the Alliance for Downtown Ossining.</p>
        <p>A Harvest Festival yesterday  capped the season, but the market is remaining open until Nov. 23, with  the addition of apples, gourds, Brussels sprouts, kale and other late crops.</p>
        <p>''This place is great,'' said Judy Huston of Scarborough, as she picked out a bag of carrots. Robert Allen, owner of the Horn of Plenty bakery in Kingston, said: ''I've told Miriam Haas that she and her husband are doing things the right way here. It shows in how all the vendors feel about this market.''</p>
        <p>One measure of how highly Mr. Allen regards the Ossining Farmers  Market is that he wakes up at 5 A.M. and spends his only day off here, selling bread, muffins and pies.</p>
        <p>The newest vendor is Alison Appleby, who works during the week in the creamery at Hollow Road Farms in Stuyvesant, N.Y., making cheese and yogurt from sheep and cow's milk. Ms. Appleby, 25, was impressed both by the diverse clientele and the other proprietors. ''My first week here everyone came over to welcome me,'' Ms. Appleby said. ''It was very farmy.''</p>
