        <p>HOPPER HOUSE ART</p>
        <p>Twenty-five distinguished artists have lent works to an exhibition celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Hopper House Art Center in Nyack. It opens today with a reception from noon to 4:30 P.M., and will continue through Dec. 1.</p>
        <p>The title of the exhibition, ''Realism after 7 A.M.: Realist Painting After Edward Hopper,'' was taken from his painting ''7 A.M.,'' which is believed to have been inspired by a storefront on North Broadway and School Street in Upper Nyack.</p>
        <p>Represented in the show are Eric Fischl, Alex Katz, Malcolm Morley, Philip Pearlstein, Fairfield Porter, Ed Ruscha, Mark Tansey and John Beerman. The curator was the New York art critic Richard Milazzo, who will give a talk at the gallery on Friday at 7 P.M.</p>
        <p>The center, converted from Hopper's boyhood home and maintained by the nonprofit Edward Hopper Landmark Preservation Foundation, is at 82 North Broadway. Hours are Thursday through Sunday from noon to 5 P.M., and Friday evening until 7:30. Admission is free but a donation of $1 is suggested. For more information, call 358-0774.</p>
        <p>THE OTHER HOLMES</p>
        <p>''Harley Holmes,'' Joe Hartin's comedy about Sherlock's envious sibling, will open at the Paramount East in Peekskill on Saturday at 8 P.M. Produced by the Theater Arts Guild of Peekskill, the seven-character play was first presented at a drama festival in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995, and had a four-week run last July Off Broadway at the Harold Clurman Theater in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The script revolves around Harley's attempts to match his brother's fame by hiring a writer to record his (Harley's) adventures as a detective, mimicking Dr. Watson's chronicles of Sherlock's capers. He is convinced that it was Dr. Watson's way with words that created Sherlock's reputation rather than Sherlock's deeds. Of course he comes up short.</p>
        <p>After opening night, performances are scheduled on Nov. 7, 8 and 9 at 8 P.M., with matinees next Sunday and Nov. 10 at 2 P.M. The theater is at 1016 Brown Street, and tickets at $8 to $12 can ay be reserved by calling 736-6729.</p>
        <p>TELLING STORIES</p>
        <p>Jonathan Kruk, Westchester's intrepid storyteller, pays homage to the spooky season today at 1 P.M. with an hourlong family program of tales steeped in mystery and history. It will take place at the John Jay Homestead, 400 Route 22 in Katonah, and admission will be $5, $4 for people 65 and older, and $3 for children. Complimentary cookies and cider will be served at the close of Mr. Kruk's presentation, and free guided tours of the homestead will be available.</p>
        <p>Real and imagined characters are woven into Mr. Kruk's stories of Major Andre's ghost and the spirit of the White Lady of Tarrytown who died of a broken heart when her Tory lover abandoned her. The Revolutionary War hero Luther Kennecott who spied on the British; Enoch Cosby, who worked to defend the Hudson Valley, and John Jay himself, who was involved in uncovering those who were plotting against the patriots, are some of the characters populating the stories. For directions, reservations or more information, call 232-5651.</p>
        <p>WOMEN'S SERIES</p>
        <p>The new Women's Center established in Founder's Hall on the Manhattanville College campus in Purchase offers its first series of programs aimed at women of all ages and life styles. Five free workshops will be presented from tomorrow through January, and two three-part seminars are scheduled at a cost of $25 each.</p>
        <p>Established by the college and Westchester Jewish Community Services, one of the county's largest nonprofit, nonsectarian health and social services agencies, the new center will maintain a drop-in area, a resource for referrals to specific services, and a venue for counseling, workshops and seminars.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow from 6 to 8:30 P.M. the first free workshop will address the topic of careers and decision making and include a screening of the film ''My Brilliant Career.'' Adult children and aging parents will be the subject on Nov. 6 from 1 to 2:30 P.M. On Nov. 20 from noon to 1:30 P.M., the discussion will focus on balancing work and family. The sessions on Nov. 21 and Jan. 22 from 10 to 11:30 A.M. will cover roles and relationships, and communications skills within the family, respectively.</p>
        <p>The seminars, on Nov. 12, 19 and 16, and Nov.18, 25 and Dec. 2, will be held from 9:30 to 11 A.M. The first one will be about the impact of physical, sexual and emotional abuse on adult women; the second will explore self-esteem and inner resources.</p>
        <p>For more information or to sign up for a program, call one of the co-directors: Lenore Rosenbaum, 949-0788, extension 237, or Dr. Nancy Harris, 323-5330.</p>
        <p>ARTISTS AT NARDIN</p>
        <p>The Nardin Galleries in Somers is exhibiting the unusual work of two artists: Leo Manso, a collagist whose pieces are small in scale, beautifully colored and subtly composed; and William King, a sculptor who uses nontraditional materials and a tongue-in-cheek approach to his subjects.</p>
        <p>The show will be on view through Nov. 17, Tuesdays through Sundays from noon to 7 P.M. or by appointment. The Nardin Galleries are on Route 202 and the phone number is 276-8485.</p>

His performance, the third yearly appearance he has made for the center, will take place at the Tarrytown Music Hall and is suitable for families with children 7 and older.</p>
