        <p>JOHN WALSH came to New York University's film school as a bright-eyed freshman from Tarrytown, N.Y. Before long he had befriended Sally Roy, a classmate from Hartford who was originally a drama student but switched to film after realizing that a stage career meant she'd have to work nights.</p>
        <p>Just two players in the strange puree of ego, ambition, insecurity and competitiveness that is the film school, they collaborated on their undergraduate work, making the black-and-white shorts that are meant to be steppingstones to real-life movie careers. Sally would edit John's films; John would act as cameraman for Sally's. They graduated in 1984 and went their separate ways. Ten years later, they made a movie together that opened in theaters last Friday.</p>
        <p>The movie, ''Ed's Next Move,'' is the gently told tale of how a young scientist from Wisconsin learns to make his way in New York, from finding an apartment to securing a first date -- a kind of ''Local Hero'' meets E. B. White's essay ''Here Is New York.'' John wrote and directed it; Sally produced it.</p>
        <p>That's just the outline of the story of how this movie -- one of perhaps hundreds of independent films being made in the city at any given time -- came to be. Over the last half-dozen years, New York has become the capital of the independent film, generally defined as a low-budget feature with no financial backing from a major studio. ''Probably two-thirds of our feature films are independent,'' says Patricia Reed Scott, Commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting, which issues permits to movie crews.</p>
        <p>They have become the self-defining medium of choice. ''It's like writing your first novel was, 10 years ago,'' says Valerie Sheppard, market director of the Independent Feature Film Market, a film festival held every September at the Angelika Theater on Houston Street. ''Now it's making your first film.''</p>
        <p>People point to certain forces creating the boom, like the increasing numbers of film students in New York -- from N.Y.U. to Columbia to the School of Visual Arts -- and an increase in  production-related companies here that can do everything for an independent film, from renting a camera crew to dubbing the soundtrack for a foreign release. First-time film makers can find themselves working down the hall in post-production with Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese, or taking over a set abandoned in a sound stage by someone equally well known.</p>
        <p>Reinforcing this are the film festivals: at prestigious ones like Sundance, many of the films that set people buzzing -- about Chinese restaurants, Brooklyn teen-agers, youthful lesbians -- are made here, by people the average moviegoer has never heard of, on budgets the size of the proverbial shoestring.</p>
        <p>Out of this recent tradition comes ''Ed's Next Move,'' which was finished despite the many headaches that seem to accompany most independent efforts. With hardly any money to film with (a grand total of about $93,000), and most of it leveraged with a stack of credit cards, Mr. Walsh and Ms. Roy had to wrest agreements out of people to do things for less, if not for free. A few key things fell gracefully into their hands; several others collapsed before their eyes. Certain New Yorkers surprised them with helpfulness. And they got towed a lot.</p>
        <p>Along the way, a recurring theme developed -- something about making up for a shortage of cash with an abundance of goodwill. And about asking people, often for a lot, at this panhandling extreme of a glitzy industry.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the production assistants learned a good lesson on this movie,'' Ms. Roy says. ''And that was, if you don't have a lot of money, you have to be kind.''</p>
        <p>Now, with Orion Classics picking up the American rights and a German company paying to show the film in Germany, they have broken even -- meaning their income has now met up with their filming and production costs, if not the $990,000 in deferred salaries to cast and crew and some other costs, Mr. Walsh says. The future -- profit margins, financing for a second film he's writing, even their reputation in the gossipy movie world -- is a little less clear.</p>
        <p>''The big question is, when they do their second film, how are they?'' says Bill Nisselson, studio manager at Sound One, a sound-editing company, who has seen plenty of promising film makers transmogrified by money and power. ''Everybody doesn't necessarily stay the same way.''</p>
        <p>Going It Alone. Scraping Up the Money</p>
        <p>The movie was originally titled ''More Bad Times,'' and Mr. Walsh wrote it in 1991 when he was collecting unemployment. (He had worked on a couple of major movies, ''Married to the Mob'' and ''Dogfight,'' in  off-screen supporting roles.) Over the next 18 months, he rewrote it six times. He shopped it to a couple of studios, where executives said things like, ''We need a famous actor,'' to the point that Mr. Walsh  decided to just make it himself.</p>
        <p>Then he started talking to Ms. Roy about it. ''Ultimately, John and I must have talked to each other every day for three years about this movie,'' Ms. Roy says.</p>
        <p>She wasn't going to be the producer. Mr. Walsh had already talked her husband, Peter Nelson, into being his director of photography, and Ms. Roy had said she didn't think it was feasible for both of them to work without pay. At the time, she was the production manager for a PBS series with Bill Moyers, ''Healing and the Mind.''</p>
        <p>But then it appeared that a woman Mr. Walsh knew, whose father ran a cable company, might underwrite the filming for as much as $500,000. He approached Ms. Roy  again and said, ''You wouldn't have to do it for free.'' She agreed to be the producer. Then the woman's father didn't like the script, and the plan collapsed. But Ms. Roy never did resign from the project.</p>
        <p>They started gathering everything they would need to make the film, like money. They came up with $13,000 between them; $70,000 more came from Visa and Mastercard. (Much later, a crew member tossed in  an additional $10,000.) Mr. Walsh had 12 cards bearing his name by the time the movie finished shooting.</p>
        <p>''A lot of places take credit cards now,'' Mr. Walsh says, reflectively. ''Sometimes there were vendors that let us use a credit card to pay our bills. I did have to take out a few huge cash advances. I'd go into a bank and say, 'I need $9,000 in cash,' then hand them my Capital One card.''</p>
        <p>Such financing is not unusual, but not recommended, said Dana Harris, managing editor of the Independent Film and Video Monthly. ''But John's got that strange combination of logic and blind faith, which is an excellent combination for an independent film maker,'' she said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, they were auditioning actors, lining up locations, learning to accept the word ''No!'' and figuring out how to move on. They cajoled people they knew into working on the movie gratis, using their network of film school friends and friends from subsequent projects. They enticed others with notices tacked to bulletin boards, promising experience in exchange for weeks of unpaid hard work.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest traumas for Ms. Roy and Mr. Walsh was realizing they could not afford to work with the Screen Actors Guild, a source of good, experienced people. But at $75 a day, even the union's lowest rate would be too expensive for them.</p>
        <p>Then along came people like Kevin Carroll, a 24-year-old New York University graduate who was then appearing as Belize in ''Angels in America'' on Broadway. Susan Shopmaker, the casting director, knew him and brought him to audition for the role of Ray, Ed's roommate. The part had not originally been written with a black actor in mind, Mr. Walsh said. But when Mr. Carroll tried out, it was a perfect match.</p>
        <p>Locations posed another puzzle. Some of the things Mr. Walsh desperately wanted, like a quaint Russian coffee shop in the East Village for his several counter scenes, turned out to be too expensive. As in $4,000 or more. ''So Sally decided to ask the Just-Pik't guy who the nice coffee shop owners were,'' Mr. Walsh recalled, referring to a fruit-juice distributor. ''And he came up with Eisenberg's, at Fifth and 22d.''</p>
        <p>There were many more compromises. Penn Station said they couldn't film there. But Grand Central Terminal said they could. The Cloisters wanted $5,000 in insurance; they were replaced by Trinity Church, which wanted only about $700. St. Mark's Church on East 10th Street originally figured in the script, but the church said they could not film in front of its facade. The scene ended up taking place in the Miracle Garden on East Third Street. Ms. Roy and Mr. Nelson's building in the East Village appears a couple of times in the film.</p>
        <p>People scoured their apartments for props, like suitcases, alarm clocks, wooden spoons. A few companies donated products in return for getting them on screen: Lee Jeans, Budweiser, the Sealed Air Corporation (with bubble wrap that appears as part of a contemporary sculpture). When Mr. Walsh wanted to shoot Ed's first New York City cab ride and show the meter clicking along at an extraordinary rate, Ms. Roy  went to a taxi garage on 11th Avenue, near the sound stage, where the mechanics were perhaps too willing to help.</p>
        <p>''I went in and said, 'We need to have a meter go really fast,' '' she recalled. ''And they said: 'No problem. We can make it do whatever you want.' ''</p>
        <p>Some things were eerily serendipitous. They found a band already named Ed's Redeeming Qualities to play themselves in the movie. When they went to the sound stage, Raw Space, on West 42d Street, they discovered an entire tenement set abandoned by the last film that had been in there. Film itself, one of the highest costs in any project this size, turned out to be available as ''short ends,'' left over from the movie ''Smoke.'' Each ''end'' was less than 10 minutes' worth of film, but there were 120,000 feet of them.</p>
        <p>''They sold it to us for 20 cents on the dollar,'' Mr. Walsh says, his eyes lighting up at the memory. What was left over, he added, Ms. Roy resold to another movie. For more than 20 cents on the dollar.</p>
        <p>Now they were ready to make the movie.</p>
        <p>The Tension Mounts: Will People Quit?</p>
        <p>In October 1994, they began their four-week shoot, an intense period of 16-hour days that took them from Morristown, N.J. (the closest reasonable substitute for small-town Wisconsin, whence Ed came) to the chilly waters of the Hudson (for its view of the railroad tracks) to the meat counter at Balducci's, where the camera lingers on a $109-a-pound slab of Kobe beef.</p>
        <p>Tensions were high. They were up against money, and not long on time. Ms. Roy and Mr. Walsh lost a lot of sleep, principally over the question of whether 45 people working for nothing would stick with the project.</p>
        <p>''It's not that it's O.K. not to get paid,'' says Cindy Kaplan, who plays a translator in an early scene, though she would have liked to play Lee, Ed's romantic interest. ''It's also about how you're treated when you're not getting paid. It's sort of a leap of faith you make: I know this is a good project, I know these are good people, I know it's worth my time.''</p>
        <p>The producer, meanwhile, wasn't always so confident. ''You always held your breath to see who was coming back,'' Ms. Roy said.</p>
        <p>They spent two days at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a classic-looking place that doesn't actually serve blintzes, as it does in the movie. The owner, Steve Oh, insists he has the best tuna salad and chocolate egg creams in town. He has trouble remembering the crew from ''Ed's Next Move,'' even though they paid him $2,000 to use the shop. ''They make a lot of movies here,'' Mr. Oh confessed.''The only one I can remember clearly was 'Lover Man.' ''</p>
        <p>They seem to have made more of an impression at Balducci's, where they filmed without charge. ''They were very nice,'' said Julio Collado, a butcher. ''We did it in three takes. They asked for some chicken breasts, told me to give them to the actor. They told me to be very natural.''</p>
        <p>Halfway through, the production manager quit. Mr. Walsh said she had not got along with one of the other crew members. When she left, she took her live-in boyfriend with her, who happened to be the location manager -- another important person. That meant Sharon Fitzpatrick, who had answered a help-wanted ad on an N.Y.U. bulletin board to become the movie's location assistant, moved up.</p>
        <p>There was at least one other person who might have exited, but for the money situation. ''I wish I could have fired him,'' Ms. Roy said, refusing to identify him, ''but I couldn't, because I couldn't find anyone else to work for free.''</p>
        <p>Takes were not shot over and over in search of perfection because of the limits on money and time.</p>
        <p>''We were all sensitive to the fact that these were John's credit cards, so let's be as clean as we can be,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''He didn't necessarily say it. It just got out.''</p>
        <p>The organization was memorable to at least one other actor. ''They were on time for everything,'' says Lisa Harris, who has a small role. ''When you work on an independent film and you're non-SAG and everything goes smoothly, it's a real treat.''</p>
        <p>Outside the set, the city went on as usual. People's cars were towed. One assistant's, in particular, Mr. Walsh said. ''He was from a Slavic country, and he didn't quite know what a fire hydrant looked like,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another time, Ms. Roy remembers, a man cutting tiles with a screeching saw was disturbing filming on West 76th Street, which is no longer in the movie. An assistant walked across his tile project to ask him to turn off the machine. The man erupted.</p>
        <p>''So I had to take four or five irate calls from that guy,'' she says.</p>
        <p>And there was the day they decided to film on a basketball court on Horatio Street. A block away was the filming of ''City Hall,'' with about 100 teamsters, Ms. Roy says. ''One came up and started asking who's your producer, what's your budget,'' she said. ''When he heard it was $85,000, he just said, 'Good luck to yez.' ''</p>
        <p>The crew got a daily hot lunch and plenty of coffee and doughnuts during this time. Mr. Walsh later called it the best time he ever had. Ms. Roy said she lost 15 pounds  attending to various urgent issues.</p>
        <p>''They came to me with everything, like there's no ice in the cooler, or the location is throwing us out,'' she said. ''John Walsh lived in a bell jar. Our job was to keep all the problems away from him so he could get this movie shot.''</p>
        <p>Once that was done, the movie moved into a complicated and costly process known as post-production, in which everything from film editing to sound effects takes place in hushed, darkened studios that charge by the hour. A further $115,000 was spent on this, getting the film in shape to submit to festivals. Before it went to theaters, it would require an additional $150,000 in polishing, including an original soundtrack by Benny Golson, a legendary jazzman. Mr. Walsh and Ms. Roy raised $95,000 more from investors, people they knew who had seen the movie and liked it, and kicked in $10,000 or so. They also worked on other jobs, putting their money back into the film.</p>
        <p>As they were getting ready to submit their creation to the Sundance Film Festival, the two film makers decided ''More Bad Times'' was not a title that would draw audiences like a magnet. So they sat around trying to think of something better.</p>
        <p>''That was the hardest thing John and I had to do,'' Ms. Roy said. Their candidates ranged from ''Ed's Redeeming Qualities'' (the band said no) to ''Ed's New Life'' to, in a moment of panic, ''Cheese Boy in the Big City.'' Finally came ''Ed's Next Move.''</p>
        <p>Ed's Epilogue: What the Future Holds</p>
        <p>The film was screened at the Independent Feature Project's film market at the Angelika last fall. One of the Sundance organizers saw the last 20 minutes, Mr. Walsh said, and invited them to show it there.</p>
        <p>There Orion Classics bought the rights for American distribution, and now Mr. Walsh's company, Ed's Films Inc., is selling the foreign rights, one country at a time. He's also working on another script.</p>
        <p>''Ed's Next Move'' is playing in one or two theaters in the city, after mixed reviews. Its creators, Mr. Walsh said, owe about $990,000 in deferred wages to their crew and $35,000 in credit card interest, which is to be paid from income from ticket sales, new foreign rights, video sales and other sources.</p>
        <p>Then, of course, there are other movies to make, with or without a big budget.</p>
        <p>''Ultimately, if people think you care about them and care about what you're doing, they will work very hard for you,'' Ms. Roy said. ''It's worked out pretty well.''</p>
