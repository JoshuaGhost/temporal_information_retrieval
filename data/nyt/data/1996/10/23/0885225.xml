        <p>The revolutionary concept of interleague play will remain on baseball's drawing board instead of being implemented next season if owners and players don't complete a new labor agreement in the next couple of weeks, the acting commissioner acknowledged tonight.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters before Game 3 of the World Series, Bud Selig said there were ''compelling reasons'' to get a deal ''in the very near future.'' One of them, he said, was the schedule, which calls for regular-season games between American and National League teams for the first time. ''We need to get a schedule out,'' Selig said. ''The clubs want to start selling tickets. It's serious. That's an immediate problem.''</p>

        <p>The revolutionary concept of interleague play will remain on baseball's drawing board instead of being implemented next season if owners and players don't complete a new labor agreement in the next couple of weeks, the acting commissioner acknowledged tonight.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters before Game 3 of the World Series, Bud Selig said there were ''compelling reasons'' to get a deal ''in the very near future.'' One of them, he said, was the schedule, which calls for regular-season games between American and National League teams for the first time. ''We need to get a schedule out,'' Selig said. ''The clubs want to start selling tickets. It's serious. That's an immediate problem.''</p>
        <p>How immediate? ''A couple weeks, Nov. 15 at the latest,'' Selig said. ''And that's later than it should be.''</p>
        <p>Union officials have said they will not agree to interleague play except in the context of a new collective bargaining agreement. They have also said they need a deal before the end of the filing period for free agency. That period begins the day after the end of the World Series and runs 15 days.</p>
        <p>''We have players who under a new agreement will be free agents, either under restored service or the elimination of repeater rights,'' Donald Fehr, the head of the union, said earlier in the day. ''There will be a time when these players will be disadvantaged.''</p>
        <p>Fehr wants Selig to schedule an owners' meeting so that he knows a new agreement will be presented to the owners if he and Randy Levine, the clubs' chief negotiator, complete it.</p>
