        <p>Two high school cheerleaders were slain after house-sitting overnight on Thursday at the home of one of the girls in the Finger Lakes hamlet of McLean, N.Y., the state police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>''We've recovered physical evidence, and we are certain they are dead,'' Maj. Arthur Hawker, commander of Troop C in Cortland, said at an afternoon news conference.</p>
        <p>Major Hawker declined to describe the nature of the evidence or say whether the bodies of the girls, who were reported missing late Friday, had been found. He said the police were searching a Dumpster outside an auto repair shop in the area, but he would not say whether body parts had been found there.</p>
        <p>School officials, fellow students and neighbors were unanimous in describing the 16-year-old girls, Jennifer L. Bolduc of Dryden and Sarah A. Hajney of McLean, as people difficult to dislike. They were varsity cheerleaders at Dryden High School as well as good students and they held part-time jobs, Miss Hajney at Clark's Food Mart in the tiny community of Dryden and Miss Bolduc across the street at an ice cream stand.</p>
        <p>''We have an extremely torn-up high school right now,'' said Dr. Donald Trombley, the Dryden Superintendent of Schools. ''The students are very frightened. They don't feel safe at home.''</p>
        <p>The police said that a car belonging to the Hajney family had been found with smears of blood inside after being left in a parking lot by a man wearing elbow-length yellow rubber gloves. The police would not confirm a report that a knife was missing from the Hajney home, where the girls spent Thursday night.</p>
        <p>A search for the man seen near the car, involving dogs, helicopters and police officers on foot, was still under way yesterday amid the rollings hills and woods of the semirural area. Yesterday afternoon, Major Hawker said investigators were checking a report that one of the girls may have been harassed recently by a man.</p>
        <p>The police are looking for a balding man in his 40's, believed to be 5 feet 7 inches to 5 feet 10 inches tall, stocky with a noticeable belly. He was last seen in dark clothing.</p>
        <p>The last person other than the killer to see the girls alive is believed to be a 17-year-old male student who stayed overnight with the girls so they would feel safer, investigators said. The boy, who was not identified, left for school between 7 and 7:30 A.M. on Friday.</p>
        <p>As the school day wore on and the girls did not appear, concern arose at Dryden High. It was uncharacteristic of the girls to skip school, especially on a day when they had a cheerleading assignment, and Friday was a football game day.</p>
        <p>Relatives of Miss Hajney reported the girls missing, and her parents were summoned back from a vacation trip. Dogs and helicopters were used over the weekend to look for the girls. A $10,000 reward was offered by the Ithaca construction company where Miss Hajney's father works. ''Missing'' posters were tacked up throughout Dryden, a village of about 3,000 just south of Cortland.</p>
        <p>But from what Major Hawker said yesterday, and from other accounts, it seems clear that the girls were already dead.</p>
        <p>On Friday afternoon, workers at a fishing-line company next to the Tioughnioga River saw a stocky, balding man park a gray car in the company parking lot, then walk down the road and out of sight.</p>
        <p>The workers noticed the man because the 100 or so employees of the company, Cortland Line, own it and know each other, Stanley Zattowsky, the president of the company, said yesterday. The company cafeteria overlooks the parking lot, so a number of eyes fell on the stranger and stayed on him until he disappeared down Kellogg Road, Mr. Zattowsky said.</p>
        <p>Hours went by, and when it grew dark someone noticed that the inside light was on in a car in the lot, Mr. Zattowsky said. A night-shift worker went to the car to turn off the light and save the owner a dead battery.</p>
        <p>The worker saw that the inside was smeared with dark stains, so the police were summoned, Mr. Zattowsky said. A police check revealed that the 1992 Chevrolet Lumina was owned by the Hajney family.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zattowsky said the Tioughnioga River is ''more like a good-sized creek'' near the plant -- about 40 feet wide -- and might be fordable.</p>
        <p>The news of the killings dealt a collective heartbreak to Dryden High students, who expressed disbelief and horror yesterday. ''There's nowhere you can feel safe anymore,'' said a student, who declined to give her name.</p>
        <p>A classmate of the girls, David Centro, said he felt angry that his friends from grade-school days had died in such a way.</p>
        <p>Capt. Thomas Kelly of the State Police said the girls' parents ''are doing as you'd expect -- they received some devastating news today.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Trombley said yesterday that the 17-year-old youth who stayed overnight with the girls so they would feel safer ''is having a tough time.'' For now, the youth's grief overpowers his logic, and he thinks ''it was all his fault,'' Dr. Trombley said.</p>
        <p>Some residents said Dryden had had more than its share of horror and grief even before the girls' deaths. Two weeks ago, a mechanic at a car dealership killed a co-worker with a shotgun after an argument, the police said. Dr. Trombley said the children of the victim and the children of the suspect are students in the school system he runs.</p>
        <p>Late in 1994, the Dryden football coach, Steve Starr, was shot to death defending his daughter from a former boyfriend who had become a stalker. The coach's killer then drove to a cemetery and took his own life.</p>
        <p>Students at Dryden High were told they could go home early today.</p>
        <p>The Purple Lion Ice Cream place, where Jennifer Bolduc worked, closed early yesterday. In the window were ''missing'' posters, suddenly outdated.</p>
