        <p>Trisha Brown is not a choreographer who invites viewers to sit back and let the dancing wash over them. ''Newark'' and ''For M.G.: The Movie,'' two works on the program that closed her company's season at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Sunday, require keen looking.</p>
        <p>For ''Newark,'' the artist Donald Judd designed a series of colored backdrops that rise and descend in front or behind eight dancers while his whirring sound score stops and starts at similar set intervals.</p>
        <p>The closer the drop is to the audience, the smaller the space for the dancers at that moment. Within this conceptual labyrinth, almost overwhelmed by its colors, the cast acts out some of Ms. Brown's most tantalizing movement experiments. The title of ''Newark'' is, in fact, a pun on the idea of ''new work.'' And here Ms. Brown, rejecting her more typical fluid idiom, concentrates on extreme weighted movement.</p>
        <p>The choreography is rich and eccentric from the start. Two men, Stanford Makishi and Ming-Lung Yang, who opened Friday night's program, drop fearlessly to the floor.</p>
        <p>The women took the same physical risks. Diane Madden joined the first two men while Kathleen Fisher and Abigail Yager offered a nuanced view of how energy is transformed into muscular tension. Mariah Maloney and Gena Rho, typical of the company's assertive women, completed a female quartet.</p>
        <p>Keith Thompson, an admirably individual dancer, introduced the high-flying partnering. Yet here again there was nothing light and airy. Rather one thought of parts of Stonehenge being tossed up like cabers.</p>
        <p>''For M.G.: The Movie'' has its own beauty and grows progressively mysterious. The piece is a tribute to Michel Guy, the French Minister of Culture who admired Ms. Brown's work; the ''movie'' may refer to the choreography that is run backward. The central figure was Ms. Madden, jogging, walking or racing around the stage and sometimes doing all that in reverse. By contrast, Ms. Fisher and Mr. Yang were the constants. They stood with their backs to the audience. Only near the end did Ms. Fisher join the rest of the cast, who occasionally resembled clay figures in stillness. Wil Swanson wandered into this imaginary museum, looking upward. Ms. Brown entered even later. She inched toward Mr. Yang and touched him as if he were a totem to be cherished.</p>
