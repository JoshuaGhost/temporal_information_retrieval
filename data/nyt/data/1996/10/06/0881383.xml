        <p>Espinoza-Watson plays for the Colorado Silver Bullets, a barnstorming women's professional baseball team that recently completed its third season -- compiling a respectable 18-34 record against men's minor league and amateur All Star teams.</p>
        <p>Q: How do men react when you beat them?</p>
        <p>A: At the beginning they act like it's all a joke, like entertainment. But then if it's the third, fourth, fifth inning, and we're up on them, they dig in, start throwing harder and get really upset.</p>
        <p>Q: Do the Silver Bullets ever get in brawls?</p>
        <p>A: There's been a few near-brawls because our left fielder, Angie Marzetta, was hit 16 times this year at the plate. She always yells at the pitchers, and she'll take a few steps to the mound and she says, You guys got my back? You got me? And we're like, What are we going to do to these men, but yeah, we're behind you. They'd whup us if we ever tried anything, but we'd go out there for her.</p>
        <p>Q: You bashed a 420-foot home run this year -- the longest of the team's three homers. Were you tempted to taunt the pitcher during your trot?</p>
        <p>A: Oh, God, no. I didn't even look at him.</p>
