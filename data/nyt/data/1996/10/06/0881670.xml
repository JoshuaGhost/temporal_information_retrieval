        <p>Justice Herman Cahn rejects rent increase Metropolitan Life imposed for 147,000 defective windows it installed at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village in Manhattan in 1993 (S)</p>

        <p>A State Supreme Court judge has rejected the rent increase Metropolitan Life imposed last year for the 147,000 defective windows the company installed three years ago at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the sprawling middle-income projects it owns on First Avenue between 14th to 23d Streets. Justice Herman Cahn last week ordered the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal to re-examine Met Life's application for a rent hike based on the $30 million it spent on new double-paned windows, which began to implode shortly after their installation in the two complexes, which together have 110 buildings. ''This victory bolsters the notion that people shouldn't have to pay for broken and defective merchandise,'' said Jack Lester, an attorney representing the tenants. Metropolitan Life says it plans to appeal the decision. In the meantime, residents will not have to pay the estimated 6 percent rent increase.</p>

        <p>Two Lower East Side cultural centers won a reprieve last week when the city-owned buildings they occupy were taken off the auction block. The city had planned to sell the abandoned Gothic schoolhouse at 107 Suffolk Street, which houses the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Center, and a building at 605 East Ninth Street occupied by El Bohio Cultural Center. The centers rent the spaces from the city. ''There was a tremedous outpouring of support by the community and elected officials,'' said Jack Deacy, a spokesman for City Hall.</p>
