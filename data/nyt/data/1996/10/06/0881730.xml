        <p>Night after night, for weeks now, thousands of angry Dubliners have been marching up to the doorsteps of people they suspect to be drug dealers, shouting, cursing and demanding that they leave the neighborhood. The police stand by, not making arrests, merely keeping the demonstrators in line.</p>
        <p>''Get out now!'' a demonstrator shouted, with several hundred people cheering him, during a recent protest in a working-class area of Dublin's north side.</p>
        <p>''We're addicts, not pushers,'' a haggard young woman shouted back from a second-floor window. ''We're trying to quit it, trying to bring up our kids.''</p>
        <p>Some of the targets of these protests, still insisting that they use drugs but do not sell them, have moved out. Officials say they fear that some of the 40 or so anti-drug groups are on the verge of vigilante violence.</p>
        <p>''I don't like what I see on television,'' said Pat Byrne, commissioner of the National Police. ''I don't like the reports I'm getting from my people on the ground in relation to the behavior of some people on these marches.''</p>
        <p>Tom King, an assistant police commissioner, said the police were concerned that the anti-drug movement could lead to vigilante killings, as has happened in Northern Ireland, where groups affiliated with the Irish Republican Army have killed several drug dealers in the last year.</p>
        <p>''Do the people of Dublin want that in their streets?'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Fergus McCabe, leader of one of the anti-drug groups, said: ''Nobody is supporting a vigilante approach. That's just a red herring raised by the media.''</p>
        <p>And Liam Smith, another anti-drug group leader, charged that the police ''seem unwilling or unable to deal with the problem.''</p>
        <p>''This whole campaign is frustration from proper authorities failing to deal with people like these,'' he said. ''My child was offered heroin coming out of school at lunchtime. He's 13 years old.''</p>
        <p>The Government and the police say they will soon produce a new strategy to control the drug business, which is run by organized criminals with names like the Monk and the Viper. Drug arrests have risen steadily in recent years and are expected to reach 4,000 this year. The amount of heroin confiscated annually has increased fivefold in the last three years.</p>
        <p>These figures confirm what virtually everyone here already knows: that the scourge of drug addiction has crossed the Irish Sea and become a major problem in Dublin. For years, Ireland, on the western edge of Europe, was relatively isolated from the problem that has long existed in Britain and on the Continent. There are now at least 7,000 addicts in the Dublin area, which has a population of about one million.</p>
        <p>''We are on a par now with other European cities,'' said Liz McManus, the Minister for Housing and Environment.</p>
        <p>''The drug problem in Dublin is out of control,'' said Tony Gregory, a member of Parliament from an inner-city area where drugs are sold freely to children on the streets.</p>
        <p>Most of the drug problem is in working-class areas of Dublin and its suburbs, where unemployment is as high as 75 percent and thousands live in public housing.</p>
        <p>The drug of choice is heroin; there is little cocaine or crack. Many of the addicts start by smoking the heroin, then move to more addictive injections. They call it ''chasing the dragon.''</p>
        <p>Public indignation rose after the killing in June, widely believed to have been ordered by organized crime figures, of Veronica Guerin, a reporter who wrote about the drug business. The police have still not charged anyone in connection with her death.</p>
        <p>To deal with the problem, government spending on drug programs has been increased by about a third since last year, to $24 million for 1996.</p>
        <p>Government plans also call for more detoxification facilities. There are now 1,552 addicts in detoxification programs, with a waiting list of 500.</p>
