        <p>As I dug up my Yukon Gold potatoes last weekend, I saw a few monarch butterflies on my butterfly bush, and I thought of them flying all the way to Mexico to winter in the mountain forests. Maybe they were from New England, stoking up on my late bloomers, the asters and the zinnias, before soldiering on.</p>
        <p>Where do the insects go for the winter? Do you know what your earthworms are doing after the freeze? And what about the ants that were so busy all summer carrying crumbs and seeds into their nests?</p>

        <p>As I dug up my Yukon Gold potatoes last weekend, I saw a few monarch butterflies on my butterfly bush, and I thought of them flying all the way to Mexico to winter in the mountain forests. Maybe they were from New England, stoking up on my late bloomers, the asters and the zinnias, before soldiering on.</p>
        <p>Where do the insects go for the winter? Do you know what your earthworms are doing after the freeze? And what about the ants that were so busy all summer carrying crumbs and seeds into their nests?</p>
        <p>I got out my books and called a few entomologists to find out about the butterflies, which have different survival strategies depending on the species. Not all of them go south.</p>
        <p>''Mourning Cloaks overwinter as adults, going into cracks and crevices,'' said Douglas Miller, an entomologist in Beltsville, Md., for the Agriculture Department. ''On warm days, you'll see them flying around.''</p>
        <p>Other butterflies, like the Hairstreaks, die off, leaving their eggs to overwinter. The juvenile caterpillars of the Red-Spotted Purple spend the winter in rolled-up willow leaves, fastened to tree twigs with silk threads. In the spring, they emerge to feast on the tender young leaves.</p>
        <p>The elegant Swallowtails spend the cold months as caterpillars inside their chrysalises; by spring, they have transformed themselves into butterflies.</p>
        <p>''I was just out at Floyd Bennett Field and I saw one under the eaves of a building near the community gardens,'' said Dr. Orland Blanchard, who teaches biology at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University. ''The caterpillars attach themselves to tree trunks or in sheltered places. They spin a button of silk that they attach their tails to. They also spin a kind of harness or girdle around the back. Then the caterpillar sheds its skin, and the chrysalis ends up at an angle, tilted away from the tree.'' It hangs there until spring, then struggles out as a butterfly to mate and lay eggs.</p>
        <p>The monarchs will hang out in central Mexico until March. ''They just hang there from the foliage, tens of thousands on a tree,'' Dr. Blanchard said. ''They're basically in a hibernation state, but when it warms up during the day, they'll fly around a bit.''</p>
        <p>Come spring, they are ready to fly back north, laying their eggs on milkweed plants, the leaves of which feed the young caterpillars. So don't cut down all your milkweed. Or plant some, along with Queen Anne's lace and butterfly weed.</p>
        <p>Now then, what about the ladybird beetles, which most of us call ladybugs? If you live in an old house with lots of cracks and crevices, the Halloween ladybug, or the Asian species, Harmonia axyridis, may be swarming into your living room in a couple weeks, looking for a warm place to spend the winter. But most of the 475 species now in North America behave themselves, crawling under bark or leaf litter, or inside logs, or flying into barns and garages.</p>
        <p>''Insects, remember, are coldblooded,'' said Dr. William Day, an entomologist at the Beneficial Insects Research Laboratory run by the Agriculture Department in Newark, Del. ''So, as the temperature outside drops so does their body temperature, and their metabolism slows down. They also have fat reserves that they build up by feeding on bugs. In general, they don't freeze. Most insects have a built-in antifreeze, and as the weather gets gradually colder, the composition of their blood changes, so it doesn't freeze.''</p>
        <p>In January, for instance, if you found a ladybug in the barn and stuck it in your freezer, it wouldn't die. But one spending the winter in your nice warm living room might, because it would not have a chance to adjust gradually.</p>
        <p>Unless you have a few thousand ladybugs in your house, leave them alone because their larvae, which look like orange-and-black alligators, can eat 300 aphids in a couple weeks. And next June, your rosebuds will thank them.</p>
        <p>Dr. Day suggests caulking up the holes and seams in your house before Halloween to avoid the whole problem and save on heat bills to boot. And he cautions against ordering those ladybugs from California. They might fly back home as soon as you take them out of the mail pouch -- because they've been harvested while they're half asleep in the Sierras. It's better to let the local population build up -- by avoiding pesticides and planting plenty of flowers, which attract aphids, which attract ladybugs and on and on like that.</p>
        <p>As you clean up the garden, don't disturb any of the foamy, papery walnut-size egg cases formed by the female praying mantis, which can contain up to 200 eggs. The eggs can survive low temperatures, then hatch in the spring. The young disperse over the garden, eating the smallest of insects -- including one another if they get hungry. The female is pretty ruthless, too: she eats her mate before the conjugal act is even completed, using the poor guy's protein to help produce more eggs.</p>
        <p>The spined soldier bug, another great insect in the garden (it loves caterpillars, but Dr. Day doubts it could swallow a tomato hornworm) mates before the fall, lays its eggs on a tree trunk or a stem and hopes a hungry woodpecker doesn't eat them. Then, having fulfilled its biological imperative, it dies.</p>
        <p>Don't worry about the earthworms. They burrow beneath the frost line or hang out in the middle of your compost pile. The ants slow down their manic activities and hibernate in their well-stocked nests until the weather warms up and they become manic again. I could never live with an ant.</p>
        <p>Tomato hornworms burrow a few inches into the soil, where they pupate and wait out the winter months. Then they turn into big pretty moths, with brown, black and gray wings, fatten up on some flowers and lay some eggs, which turn into the caterpillars that will eat your tomato plants all over again.</p>
        <p>Aren't you glad it's almost winter?</p>
        <p>THIS WEEK  Soil Tests and Other Pre-Freeze Chores</p>
        <p>If you haven't had your soil tested for pH in a few years, now is the time. County extension services can refer you to someone to do it. If you need to add lime or anything else, putting it in now will give it a chance to work through the soil over the winter.</p>
        <p>Keep planting spring-flowering bulbs, like daffodils, fritillarias, hyacinths, lilies and crocuses. But hold off on tulips until November.</p>
        <p>Continue to divide crowded perennials, giving them a good dose of compost and watering them as you replant.</p>
        <p>Keep watering any transplanted or newly planted perennials, shrubs and trees, if you're in a dry spell. As vegetative growth slows down in the fall, energy pours into root growth.</p>
        <p>Wait until the first frost before digging the dahlias. As long as the leaves are green, they are storing energy in the tubers. Once frost hits, though, dig them up carefully, throw out any diseased tubers, label the varieties and store in a dry place -- on shelves or in pantyhose suspended from the ceiling (which looks weird, but let only your gardening friends down in the cellar).</p>
