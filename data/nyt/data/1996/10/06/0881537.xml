        <p>November 24, 1991: 'Rebuilding Russia' by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</p>
        <p>In 1979 Newsweek published a forum on the coming decade. In a brief entry, I proposed that the 1980's would see the breakup of the Soviet Union. If any American read a word of this, I have no record of the event. But one Russian did. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and his wife invited me and my wife to spend a day with them in their home near Cavendish, Vt.</p>
        <p>Taking our leave after a vast, old-fashioned 4 o'clock dinner, I asked Mr. Solzhenitsyn if he believed he would ever be able to return home. ''I had thought,'' he replied, ''I would be back by now.''</p>
        <p>Well, the Soviet Union has broken up. No one anticipated it more than Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. And now he has written a succinct, at times breathless, essay, which was originally published in the Soviet Union in September 1990 as a supplement in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda. ''Rebuilding Russia,'' wonderfully well translated by Alexis Klimoff, is instructive because it offers Mr. Solzhenitsyn's own proposals, but it is fascinating in what it says about how the breakup came about.</p>
        <p>Ethnicity: it is the great hidden force of the age (a fact still lost on what is called our ''intelligence community''). Mr. Solzhenitsyn begins here.</p>
        <p>''In the course of three-quarters of a century,'' he says, ''to the sound of incessant proclamations trumpeting 'the socialist friendship of peoples,' the communist regime has managed to neglect, entangle, and sully the relationship among . . . peoples to such a degree that one can no longer see the way back to the peaceful coexistence of nationalities, that almost drowsy non-perception of distinctions that had virtually been achieved -- with some lamentable exceptions -- in the final decades of pre-revolutionary Russia.''</p>
        <p>The American reader may be tempted to discount that talk of ''peaceful coexistence'' and the ''almost drowsy non-perception of distinctions'' in some pastoral past. But the evidence is with Mr. Solzhenitsyn, who is, after all, scarcely a man given to avoiding unpleasant facts. For example, one may consult David Fromkin's ''Peace to End All Peace'' on the douceur de vivre of Ottoman Iraq. The world has known worse things than those empires.</p>
        <p>But they could not last, or in any event, did not. At the beginning of the 20th century, nationalism, the ethnic demand for separate states, was rising all across Europe, notably in the Hapsburg and Romanov empires (and Ireland and Norway and Quebec, but let's not get started).</p>
        <p>There is a sense in which the Marxists just lucked into this. The ethnic masses were stirring; the Marxists labeled them toiling masses. Workers of the World united to undo the Emperor, the Czar, the Sultan, the whomsoever. The pre-revolutionary writings of Lenin and Stalin are filled with discussions of the Nationality Question.</p>
        <p>American scholars are firm in the view that the phrase ''self-determination'' originated with Woodrow Wilson in 1917. Not so. The Bolsheviks put it into their platform in 1903 (and the Ukrainians into the United Nations Charter in 1945). In 1913, Stalin, who was to become the first Commissar of National Minorities, was asking, ''What is to be done with the Mingrelians, the Abkhasians, the Adjarians, the Svanetians, the Lesghians?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Solzhenitsyn's view is that they must leave the new Russian state.</p>
        <p>''Substantial groups like the Tatar, Bashkir, Udmurt, Komi, Chuvash, Mordva, Mari, and Yakut. . . . The smallest national groups: the Nenets, Permyak, Evenki, Mansi, Khakas, Chukchi, Koryak, and other peoples I cannot enumerate here. They all lived well in the Tsarist 'prison of peoples' and it is we, the communist Soviet Union, who have dragged them toward extinction. We must lose no time in offering our help in restoring them to life and vigor. It is not yet too late.</p>
        <p>''Every people, even the very smallest, represents a unique facet of God's design. As Vladimir Solovyov has written, paraphrasing the Christian commandment: 'You must love all other people as you love your own.' ''</p>
        <p>But when it comes to living arrangements, you live with your own.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solzhenitsyn's dream is the return of an entity that might be called ''Rus,'' consisting of the Little Russians (Ukrainians), Great Russians and Byelorussians, and located in the Russian heartland (''we all sprang from precious Kiev''). The remaining 12 republics and assorted jurisdictions, with their numerous ethnic groups, must go.</p>
        <p>The real issue is to get on with rebuilding society. He is mostly for democracy. Two Cheers, as E. M. Forster would say. For Mr. Solzhenitsyn, democracy works well in small units, where the voters know the candidates personally and exercise ''self-restraint.'' He cites Switzerland as his ideal, along with ''citizens' assemblies'' in the United States (clearly thinking of the New England town meeting).</p>
        <p>In his 1978 Harvard commencement address, Mr. Solzhenitsyn seemed at times contemptuous of American democracy with its pusillanimous peaceniks and consumer orgiasts. But that was then. He was but two years over here and further from Russia than ever. In ''Rebuilding Russia'' he comes across as a thoroughly practical man, even something of an 18th-century man. As, you might say, Jefferson. Or Madison, who wrote of the ''fugitive and turbulent existence'' of ancient republics, and might find the Russian tough-mindedness of this essay refreshing.</p>
        <p>It appears to me, at all events, that Mr. Solzhenitsyn has understood the major 20th-century thinkers very well, among them the philosopher Karl Popper, who wrote that ''one chooses democracy, not because it abounds in virtues, but only in order to avoid tyranny''; and the economist Joseph Schumpeter, who said, in cautioning against ignoring the context of time and place, that democracy was ''the surrogate faith of intellectuals deprived of religion.'' Mr. Solzhenitsyn would build a democracy from the ground up, beginning with small regions -- towns, groups of villages, ''areas up to the size of a county'' -- and on the whole he would build slowly. He has no enthusiasm for the secret ballot, which was in fact an unthinkable notion when the United States got started. He would have a lot of indirect representation. Well, so did the Framers of the American Constitution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solzhenitsyn has not a great deal to say about the judicial branch. But what in this indomitable man's life would have given him any firsthand experience of an independent judiciary?</p>
        <p>And so, great joy to him and to his people -- to all those peoples. There is one other thing. I touched on it in that 1979 article. Who gets the warheads? That is not resolved in this book, and possibly could not be. Which could ruin everything Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn all but sacrificed his life to achieve.</p>
