        <p>Collectors take dim view of souvenir goods for sale by both Pres Clinton's and Bob Dole's Presidential campaigns; see them unlikely to grow in value; photos (S)</p>

        <p>One victor in the 1996 Presidential race is already known. It is Mort Berkowitz, a Times Square-based designer whose ''Hillary RODMAN Clinton'' button easily wins Best of Breed, placing Dennis Rodman's two-tone hairdo on the First Lady's head. When Hillary mentioned the button during her convention speech, its black-market price shot up to $75.</p>
        <p>That didn't last, of course, and professional collectors are taking a dim view of the future value of souvenir goods for sale by both campaigns. The Clinton-Gore team offers the same fanny packs and totes its supporters get when they pledge to PBS. Dole-Kemp is selling coffee mugs, golf balls and sweatshirts. Peter Siegel, owner of Gotta Have It!, a New York collectibles store, says he believes these bland, mass-produced items will never fetch a high price, no matter how much time passes. ''Today, if someone gets a set of Dole golf balls, he'll say, 'These are gonna be worth something someday.' Not true.'' Could anything appreciate dramatically, a la the button for Franklin Roosevelt's 1920 Vice-Presidential candidacy, which commands $50,000?</p>

        <p>''Maybe a football,'' Siegel says, mulling it, ''signed by both Dole and Kemp.''</p>
