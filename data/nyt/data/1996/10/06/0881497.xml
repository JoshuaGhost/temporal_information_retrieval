        <p>Having sex without a condom is a choice Mark Ebenhoch chooses to make. His behavior is not due to ''inadequate'' AIDS awareness campaigns. He's an educated man, not a ''victim.'' You don't have to be perfect to protect yourself from AIDS, just responsible.</p>
        <p>People his age (my age), gay and straight, know what it takes to avoid AIDS. Using a condom isn't spontaneous? No kidding. But we expect responsible adults to do what they have to do to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

        <p>People his age (my age), gay and straight, know what it takes to avoid AIDS. Using a condom isn't spontaneous? No kidding. But we expect responsible adults to do what they have to do to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
        <p>As for Walt Odets's comments that heterosexuals get the message that they can dispense with condom use after the partners' H.I.V.-negative status is confirmed -- come on! Once a gay couple's H.I.V.-negative status is confirmed, and they decide to enter into a long-term, monogamous relationship, who said the same rules can't apply?</p>
        <p>Why try to pit gay men, lesbians and heterosexuals against one another on this issue? For the record, we're all scared.</p>
