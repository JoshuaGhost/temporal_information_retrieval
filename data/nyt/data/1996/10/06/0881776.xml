        <p>SAVING CHINESE ANTIQUITIES</p>
        <p>Two years after the start of construction on the world's largest dam in China, a rescue effort for some of the country's best-known cultural antiquities has yet to begin. 12</p>
        <p>JAPAN'S LOW BIRTH RATE</p>
        <p>Japan's tumbling birth rate, which hit a new low last year, is causing concern among officials, who are debating how to persuade couples to have more babies. 3</p>
        <p>MONUMENT TO MIDEAST DISTRUST</p>
        <p>A West Bank shrine holy to both Jews and Muslims was the site of fierce clashes last week and has become a monument to shattered Palestinian-Israeli trust. 14</p>
        <p>INDIANS AND OIL IN COLOMBIA</p>
        <p>The Uwa Indians of Colombia, fearing the ruin of their land and culture, say they would rather die than allow exploration for oil on their territory. 9</p>
        <p>RWANDA'S CONTINUING WAR</p>
        <p>Hutu supremacists have continued to kill scores of Tutsi in Rwanda, sneaking across the border to attack from refugee camps in neighboring Zaire. 16</p>
        <p>BATTLE AGAINST DRUGS IN DUBLIN</p>
        <p>Marches against the use of illegal drugs in Dublin are raising fears of vigilante violence of the kind that has occurred in Northern Ireland in the last year. 4</p>
        <p>Tongues wag in Paris over whether the American envoy is leaving. 6</p>
        <p>Bosnian Serb leaders boycotted a swearing-in ceremony. 13</p>
        <p>National 22-36</p>
        <p>LAST BEST HOPE FOR DOLE</p>
        <p>Frustrated that their candidate is still bogged in second place, Bob Dole's advisers consider the nationally televised debates that begin Sunday night as his last best chance to reverse his fortunes. 1</p>
        <p>GENDER GAP, PART 1</p>
        <p>Polls find a strong preference for Bob Dole over President Clinton among certain groups of men, including white men who are married and live in the suburbs. 1</p>
        <p>GENDER GAP, PART 2</p>
        <p>Polls find that married white suburban women who plan to vote for President Clinton gave many reasons for their choice, but they all seemed to boil down to a perception that Bob Dole is from Mars and Mr. Clinton is from Venus. 1</p>
        <p>PRESIDENT POPULAR IN NORTHEAST</p>
        <p>There is no better gauge of President Clinton's political potency in Pennsylvania, or in the entire Northeast, than in the changed behavior of one Democrat, Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia. 26</p>
        <p>SCHOOLS FEAR HARASSMENT SUITS</p>
        <p>The recent suspensions of two little boys for kissing girls highlight the confusion of educators as they grapple with a growing fear that they may be sued for failing to intervene when one student sexually harasses another. 22</p>
        <p>CITY BOOMS NEXT TO DANGER</p>
        <p>One of the fastest-growing cities in the West is Tooele, Utah, which manages to thrive in the shadow of an aging arsenal of chemical weapons and a troubled incinerator built to destroy them. 22</p>
        <p>WELFARE LAW COMPLICATIONS?</p>
        <p>State officials have concluded that many options given to them by the new welfare law conflict with long-standing interpretations of the Federal Constitution as well as their state constitutions. 30</p>
        <p>FORGIVEN ATTACKER DIES</p>
        <p>A Florida man appears to be the only ''survivor'' of the man who kidnapped, shot and left him for dead 22 years ago. 34</p>
        <p>Metropolitan 37-46</p>
        <p>LIFE 'TRAPPED IN A CAGE'</p>
        <p>Across New York City, tens, perhaps hundreds of thousands of poor families live in miserable, crowded conditions from which they can see no way out. But they suffer privately, captives of a hidden housing crisis that has been masked for years by the more public crisis of homelessness. 1</p>
        <p>SENATE CANDIDATES FACE OFF</p>
        <p>New Jersey's candidates for the United States Senate, Representatives Richard A. Zimmer and Robert G. Torricelli, confronted each other in their first public debate. 1</p>
        <p>GIULIANI READIES AN ENDORSEMENT</p>
        <p>Political Memo: The seemingly endless dance of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani around his Presidential endorsement is drawing to a close. His friends have already begun laying the groundwork for an announcement this month that he will vote for Bob Dole and Jack F. Kemp. 37</p>
