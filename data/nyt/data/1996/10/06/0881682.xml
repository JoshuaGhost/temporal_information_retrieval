        <p>WHEN Raymond DeVoe, market strategist for Legg Mason Wood Walker, visited Japan in 1989, he heard the same story at least two dozen times. ''Everyone talked about how different Japanese investors were,'' he recalled last week. ''They were in for the long term, and nothing would be likely to make them sell their stock investments.''</p>
        <p>Seven years later, the Japanese stock market is down 40 percent, and the amount of money in the Japanese version of mutual funds has fallen more than 90 percent. Instead of holding onto their stock funds, Japanese investors have cashed out, even as the Nikkei index rallied nearly 20 percent in the last year.</p>

        <p>WHEN Raymond DeVoe, market strategist for Legg Mason Wood Walker, visited Japan in 1989, he heard the same story at least two dozen times. ''Everyone talked about how different Japanese investors were,'' he recalled last week. ''They were in for the long term, and nothing would be likely to make them sell their stock investments.''</p>
        <p>Seven years later, the Japanese stock market is down 40 percent, and the amount of money in the Japanese version of mutual funds has fallen more than 90 percent. Instead of holding onto their stock funds, Japanese investors have cashed out, even as the Nikkei index rallied nearly 20 percent in the last year.</p>
        <p>Now, with billions of dollars flowing each month into American mutual funds, United States fund investors are being characterized as the Japanese were several years ago. Americans will not flee their stock funds, the argument goes, because they know their historical performance and because they are investing for the long term.</p>
        <p>As fresh evidence, some Wall Street analysts point to the most recent quarter, when cash poured in despite a downturn in stock prices in July.</p>
        <p>But such a conclusion ignores several recent cases of investors' fleeing individual funds -- among them Fidelity Magellan, Strong Discovery and Van Wagoner Emerging Growth -- when performance did not live up to expectations. In addition, investors in Charles Schwab &amp; Company's mutual fund marketplace quickly pulled money out of funds in July when the market's long bull run appeared threatened.</p>
        <p>A longer view, too, shows that American fund investors, like their Japanese counterparts, have abandoned an entire asset class when performance lagged. Equity investors in the late 1970's and government bond investors in the last two years have continued to sell even after those investments returned to decent returns.</p>
        <p>To be sure, there is little in the performance of equity funds in the third quarter to give investors much reason to flee. According to the fund trackers at Morningstar Inc., in Chicago, the average United States stock fund gained 2.55 percent in the quarter and 12.5 percent in the first nine months of 1996. International funds, by contrast, lost an average of a half of a percent in the quarter, lowering the year's returns to 9.6 percent.</p>
        <p>Few on Wall Street expect the performance of the stock market to waver substantially the rest of the year, which means that fund companies are likely to continue to reap strong cash flows. But there is plenty of evidence that a significant portion of the people now flocking to mutual funds are an untested, if not unstable, group.</p>
        <p>According to the Federal Reserve's quarterly ''Flow of Funds'' report, released last month, mutual funds held $1.25 trillion of  equities at the end of June, up from $233 billion at the end of 1990. That means 80 percent of the money now invested in stock funds was not there during any significant downturn -- like the crash of 1987.</p>
        <p>''That's really kind of mind-boggling,'' said Melissa Brown, quantitative analyst at Prudential Securities. ''Most of the money invested in mutual funds has not gone through a bear market, so we really don't have a historical framework to determine whether individuals will stay put if we see a prolonged correction in the market. My guess is that they won't -- that they will be much more likely to pull their money out than the common wisdom would suggest.''</p>
        <p>David Kim says he will not be one headed for the exits. A 30-year-old investor who makes his living reading scripts for movie studios in Los Angeles, Mr. Kim made his first stock fund investments in July, moving about $7,000 from a Schwab money market account into three funds.</p>
        <p>Looking at how his funds have performed so far, as well as at their one-year performance, Mr. Kim wants to invest more, particularly in Stein Roe Capital Opportunities, which has gained 49.6 percent in the last 12 months. He plans to do so by taking a cash advance of $1,500 on a credit card and using it to buy more fund shares.</p>
        <p>Once he has the money in hand, Mr. Kim plans to transfer his card balance to a new credit card, which offers a low introductory interest rate of 5.9 percent for the first year. After a year, when the introductory rate expires, he intends to cash out of the fund or, if possible, roll over the loan to another card with a low rate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kim said he recognized that he could lose money, but the risk does not bother him. ''I think that given the general upward trend of the market, the idea makes sense,'' he said. ''I will give it three to six months, and if the fund is consistently going down over that time, I will cash out and pay off the principal.'' Thus, while he thinks the long-term prospects for stocks remain bright, Mr. Kim might jump in and out of the market at times.</p>
        <p>Certainly, Mr. Kim does not fit the profile of the ''average'' mutual fund investor as compiled by the Investment Company Institute, a fund trade group. In July, the institute reported that, based on a random survey of 1,165 households, the average fund investor is middle class, 44 years old, has financial assets of $50,000 and bought his first fund shares before 1990 -- none of which would suggest that fund companies need to worry about the willingness of shareholders to move in and out of positions.</p>
        <p>But fund companies could be fooling themselves if they do not recognize that they have an increasing number of shareholders like Mr. Kim. Investors certainly have demonstrated a growing interest in the ability to move assets quickly between traditional long-term investments -- stock and bond funds -- and cash accounts. So much so, in fact, that last year Charles Schwab instituted rules to discourage fund shareholders from making short-term trades.</p>
        <p>Still, Schwab investors, who make up 8 percent of all mutual fund assets and 18 percent of those in funds sold without brokers, made net withdrawals of $754 million from domestic funds in July, part of a selloff that caused some concern. But nearly as much went back into those funds in August, which some analysts say is a credit to the great stabilizing factor among fund investors -- the retirement plan.</p>
        <p>With a greater portion of today's fund investors putting money in tax-deferred plans, they probably will not cash out their investments entirely and buy consumer goods because of tax penalties. And investors love stock funds because equities have been the best long-term investment, said Avi Nachmany, an analyst at Strategic Insight, a New York consulting firm.</p>
        <p>''There will have to be a great change in the societal climate to convince people that not only are there short-term risks in stocks, but long-term investment does not resolve those risks,'' he said. Mr. Nachmany does not foresee that happening anytime soon.</p>
        <p>If it does happen, even 401(k) investors will find it easy to turn on a dime and move their money to what they see as the safest haven. In previous downturns, corporate pension managers oversaw the retirement money of millions of Americans; today the investors make the decisions.</p>
        <p>Companies like Fidelity Investments, the largest provider of 401(k) retirement plans, allow investors to switch investments 24 hours a day, by telephone. In the case of one high-profile Fidelity fund, plenty of investors have made use of that service this year.</p>
        <p>Roughly half of the $51.7 billion in the Fidelity Magellan fund, the country's largest mutual fund, comes through 401(k) plans -- presumably making those assets more stable than those of the average fund. But in the five months ended in August, as the fund fell 1.25 percent in value, investors withdrew $3.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Numerous smaller funds have also suffered cash outflows, according to AMG Data Services, which reported a $4 billion outflow from equity funds in one week in mid-July. From mid-June through late September, the Wasatch Aggressive Growth fund suffered 15 consecutive weeks of net outflows, measuring $34.8 million, or 10 percent of assets. The Founders Special fund lost $38 million, or 9 percent of assets, to outflows, and the Strong Discovery fund saw $45.5 million, or about 7 percent of assets, leave the fund.</p>
        <p>In each case, the withdrawals were on top of losses caused by the July market downturn. Even at the popular Van Wagoner Emerging Growth fund, which was flooded with money when it started last spring, more money flowed out than came in from mid-June through mid-September.</p>
        <p>Using bad performance as an excuse to cash out is a basic element of investor psychology, said Kenneth Safian, an economist and investment analyst in White Plains. The same rules that governed behavior when individuals did most of their investing through individual stocks drive the actions of fund investors, he says.</p>
        <p>The crash of 1987 was neither the first nor the worst period of redemptions by shareholders of American mutual funds. In the 96 months from November 1971 through October 1979, investors made net withdrawals from equity funds in every month but one, according to data from the Investment Company Institute. Not until November 1981 did investors put together two consecutive months of net inflows to stock funds -- even though the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose in five of the six years from 1975 through 1980.</p>
        <p>That experience parallels the cascade of withdrawals from Japanese mutual funds in recent years, said Steven Leuthold, president of the Leuthold Group, a market analysis and money management firm in Minneapolis. ''The fact that the redemptions continued after the Japanese market started back up shows how human nature responds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>American investors reacted the same way to a downturn in the bond market that started in early 1994, when the Federal Reserve embarked on a series of interest-rate increases. Since then, government bond funds have seen withdrawals in each month, despite a strong bond rally in 1995.</p>
        <p>When it comes to stock funds, investors have not made net monthly withdrawals since September 1990. ''When that much money comes into the market, any subsequent outflow will cause a big jolt to the market,'' Mr. Safian said. ''It doesn't mean that all individuals will liquidate their fund holdings, but enough will to put a shock in the system.''</p>
        <p>SOME fund analysts do not buy the Japanese example. Mr. Nachmany, of Strategic Insight, said that, unlike stock funds here, Japanese investment trusts were marketed as trading vehicles with time horizons of a year or less. And he dismisses the notion that Americans' withdrawals from bond funds the last two years would be repeated at stock funds, pointing out that bond funds were not as widely held in retirement accounts.</p>
        <p>If investors follow the course described by Mr. Nachmany, equity funds are not likely to suffer, and history will not be repeated. One investor who will not throw money blindly at stock funds, however, is Mr. Nachmany, who has a conservative penchant. ''I always find reason to be in a money fund or in a balanced fund,'' which invests in both stocks and bonds, he said. ''But I'm a terrible investor.''</p>
