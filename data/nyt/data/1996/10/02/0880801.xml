        <p>The Senate approved legislation yesterday to streamline the regulation of mutual funds, investment advisers and stockbrokers.</p>
        <p>The bill, called the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, was passed by the House of Representatives on Saturday; President Clinton is expected to sign it into law this week.</p>
        <p>Legislators, regulators and securities industry executives hailed the bill, which Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, called ''the most significant overhaul of the securities regulatory structure in years.''</p>
        <p>But average American investors are not likely to notice many of the bill's changes, most of which clarify whether the states or the Federal Government is responsible for overseeing different parts of the securities business. The main provision eliminates state review of mutual fund prospectuses and advertisements.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, regulators and investor-protection watchdogs say they are relieved that the bill does not include the sweeping changes that were proposed by Representative Jack Fields, Republican of Texas, when he introduced the original bill last year. Among those proposals were provisions that would have eliminated licensing of investment advisers, loosened disclosure requirements for corporate-takeover moves, and prohibited states from enforcing some of their anti-fraud laws.</p>
        <p>''The good news is that they did not pass the radical anti-investor provisions they considered,'' said Barbara Roper of the Consumer Federation of America. ''But as for any improvement in investor protection, I don't see it.''</p>
        <p>At the behest of Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, the legislation requires the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish an electronic data base so that investors can check the disciplinary histories of investment advisers. A similar registry for brokers is now maintained by the S.E.C., state regulators and the National Association of Securities Dealers.</p>
        <p>The bill also bars felons from becoming investment advisers for at least 10 years after their convictions; regulators used to joke mournfully that even ax-murderers could legally become mutual fund managers. And the legislation calls for an additional $40 million in financing for the S.E.C. over the next two years to be used to improve the commission's monitoring of investment advisers, who are a growing force in the financial services business.</p>
        <p>Under the new legislation, the S.E.C. will be responsible for supervising investment advisers -- mainly the big mutual fund companies -- that manage $25 million or more of clients' money. States will have jurisdiction over the smaller firms, and will continue to have the power to license the people who work for advisers.</p>
        <p>State regulators plan a nationwide effort to improve their oversight of investment advisers, said Neal E. Sullivan, executive director of the North American Securities Administrators Association. Four states have no authority to regulate advisers, and many other states provide only limited monitoring.</p>
        <p>A dispute between the House and the Senate over the investment-adviser provisions almost derailed final passage of the bill, which is strongly backed by the securities industry. The final agreement was brokered by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, who said that the bill would make it ''cheaper and easier to raise capital and create jobs.''</p>
        <p>Enactment of the bill was also slowed by disagreements among Congress, the White House and the S.E.C. over financing the commission's annual budget. The new legislation allows the commission to cut the fees it charges companies to register securities and provides $300 million for the commission next year.</p>
        <p>The S.E.C. will also raise money by charging a fee for stock trades on the Nasdaq market; the fees already apply to transactions on the New York and American Stock Exchanges.</p>
        <p>Indeed, this fee may be one of the few changes that investors will be aware of, because it will be disclosed on the confirmation tickets they receive when they make trades, said Joseph R. Hardiman, chief executive of Nasdaq. But, he added, ''the amount is so small per transaction -- it starts at one three-hundredth of 1 percent -- that it is not significant.''</p>
