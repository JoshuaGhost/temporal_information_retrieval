        <p>Pressing his campaign to forge closer ties with Muslim nations and evidently unconcerned about foreign and domestic criticism, Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan of Turkey leaves on Wednesday on a trip that will take him to Libya and Nigeria.</p>
        <p>According to press reports here, Mr. Erbakan is making the trip against the advice of his own Foreign Ministry. Turkey has been governed since June by an uneasy coalition between Mr. Erbakan's pro-Islamic Welfare Party and the Western-oriented True Path Party headed by Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller.</p>
        <p>In August, Mr. Erbakan visited Iran as part of his first foreign trip since taking office, and signed a multibillion-dollar oil transport agreement with Iranian leaders. The agreement had been under negotiation for years, but some in the West saw it as a signal that Turkey was beginning to shift its foreign policy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Erbakan's trip to Libya and Nigeria is likely to deepen Western concerns. The United States has declared Libya a terrorist state, and it is under sanctions for failing to turn over two suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. Nigeria's military rulers jailed the man widely regarded as the winner of the country's last presidential election, and executed nine opposition figures last year.</p>
        <p>Libya owes an estimated $350 million to several Turkish construction companies, and Mr. Erbakan hopes that his visit will encourage payment of the bill. A Turkish delegation traveled to Libya last month seeking payment of the debt, but Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, refused to pay and denounced ''the slaughter of Kurds in Turkey'' in a speech at which the Turkish officials were present.</p>
        <p>The leader of Turkey's largest opposition party, former Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, said a ''gaping chasm'' had opened between Turkey's pro-Western foreign policy and the policy being pursued by Mr. Erbakan. He called Mr. Erbakan's trip ''contrary to the national interest.''</p>
        <p>''A party that won only 21 percent of the vote has no right to change the course of Turkish foreign policy,'' Mr. Yilmaz said, referring to the Welfare Party's showing in the election. ''There is no consensus in Turkey for such a change.''</p>
