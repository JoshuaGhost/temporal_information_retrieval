        <p>''Politics is all about begging,'' explains a fast-talking pol in the town of Norman, Okla., one of the stop-offs in ''Politics 101,'' a peppy tour of the election-season handshake circuit. On display in Norman, in the wards of Chicago and on the byways of Providence, R.I., are candidates who still dredge for votes the old fashioned way, one voter at a time.</p>
        <p>In support of Representative Barney Frank's proposition that only a psychopath could like campaigning, the program looks at the show put on every couple of years by a Chicago alderman, Brian Doherty. One of his professional door-to-door volunteers explains, ''I go after the Irishmen,'' which as demonstrated here means doing jigs, downing Guinness and listening to poems in Gaelic, as well as taking on such ethnically neutral problems as parking tickets, sidewalk repairs and perils from outer space. (Mr. Doherty advises constituents worried about gamma rays to put aluminum foil on their ceilings.) One of his minions is heard offering to carry an elderly woman to the polls; later he fixes a broken front step that was worrying her.</p>

        <p>''Politics is all about begging,'' explains a fast-talking pol in the town of Norman, Okla., one of the stop-offs in ''Politics 101,'' a peppy tour of the election-season handshake circuit.

        <p>In support of Representative Barney Frank's proposition that only a psychopath could like campaigning, the program looks at the show put on every couple of years by a Chicago alderman, Brian Doherty.

One of his minions is heard offering to carry an elderly woman to the polls; later he fixes a broken front step that was worrying her.</p>
        <p>It's almost enough to make you sympathize with a widely mocked class of politician. There is the Mayor of Providence, Vincent A. Cianci Jr., kissing a pig; he kisses the poor animal until it squeals. He also kisses a new bride, who refrains from squealing, and he does a tap dance with what seems to be a nursing home chorus line; you can bet he does some kissing there, too.</p>
        <p>City Council hopefuls in Hawaii stand in the sun waving signs at passing cars; nobody maintains it wins votes, but everybody does it. And back in Oklahoma, local candidates make sure to work the crowd at every high school football game.</p>
        <p>''Politics 101'' is the opener of an engaging four-hour anthology, ''Vote for Me: Politics in America,'' which goes on to report on how citizen groups (otherwise known as special interests) in South Florida, Chicago and Austin, Tex., are putting pressure on legislators and how political junkies are pursuing their passion in Atlanta; Baton Rouge, La., and Johnston, R.I. It concludes tomorrow night with a 90-minute close-up of a North Carolina woman's run for Congress.</p>
        <p>In one segment of tonight's program, the camera accompanies Kathleen Brown on a 29-hour bus trip during her 1994 campaign for the governorship of California. Although advertised as whistle-stop campaigning (there she is at a chicken-processing plant), everybody understood that it was a made-for-television stunt, a way of grabbing 90 seconds or so of the local news every time she stepped off the bus. Ms. Brown is not seen kissing a chicken. Maybe that's why she lost.</p>
