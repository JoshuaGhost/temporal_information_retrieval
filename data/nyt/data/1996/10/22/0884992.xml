        <p>Integrated Health to Buy Coram in $280 Million Deal</p>
        <p>Integrated Health Services, a home health care and specialized nursing home company, agreed to buy Coram Healthcare, a troubled, debt-laden home care company, for about $280 million in stock.</p>
        <p>The deal, which includes the assumption of $375 million in Coram debt, would create one of the largest companies that provide care for patients whom hospitals no longer find profitable. $(Page D2.$)</p>
        <p>Stronger Profits at Oil Companies</p>
        <p>Several major oil companies reported higher earnings as surging prices for crude oil and natural gas more than offset rising refining costs. Oil company stocks, which have rallied recently, were flat.</p>
        <p>Texaco said net earnings jumped nearly 50 percent, compared with the third quarter of 1995; Chevron reported a 29 percent increase, excluding special items, and Exxon said profits rose 4 percent. The results met or slightly exceeded Wall Street expectations. $(Page D4.$)</p>
        <p>Stocks Seesaw, Ending Down</p>
        <p>Stocks seesawed, ending slightly lower after a morning rally following I.B.M.'s earnings report gave way to heavy profit-taking. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 3.36 points, at 6,090.87, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 6.07 points, to 1,236.41. $(D14.$)</p>
        <p>Treasury prices fell slightly, weighed down by more than $30 billion of notes to be auctioned today and tomorrow. The yield on the 30-year bond edged up to 6.80 percent. $(D21.$)</p>
        <p>Election Disappoints Japan Inc.</p>
        <p>Corporate executives in Japan have been looking to the Government for two things -- strong leadership, and economic deregulation that would lay the groundwork for Japan Inc. to roar again. But last weekend's national elections will probably fall short of either of these outcomes. $(D9.$)</p>
        <p>Few Issues Remain in G.M. Strike</p>
        <p>Representatives of G.M. and the Canadian Automobile Workers union struggled with a few remaining issues in a 19-day strike, as G.M. temporarily laid off nearly 11,000 more American workers. $(D4.$)</p>
        <p>Betting on the Internet's Future</p>
        <p>The Frontier Corporation and Qwest Communications announced plans for a $2 billion national network to carry telephone conversations and data. $(D4.$)</p>
        <p>United Airlines' Choice Questioned</p>
        <p>United Airlines' surprising selection of Fallon McElligott and Young &amp; Rubicam to share its $120 million account is raising questions about how well those two fiercely independent agencies can cooperate. But they voice optimism. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. $(D13.$)</p>
        <p>RJR Reports Stronger Profits</p>
        <p>RJR Nabisco Holdings announced that profits were increasing in its Nabisco food unit and its international tobacco business. But the company's results were marred by erosion in its domestic cigarette business. Net income in the third quarter rose 4 percent to $225 million, or 66 cents a share. Revenue increased 7 percent to $4.35 billion. $(D2.$)</p>
        <p>Corporate Credit Ratings Improve</p>
        <p>The rising stock market is having a very positive effect on American companies: corporate credit quality, as measured by changes in bond ratings, appears to be better than ever. So far this year, Moody's has upgraded the ratings of 221 companies, compared with 146 companies downgraded. Floyd Norris: Market Place. $(D14.$)</p>
        <p>USAir Earnings Rise 57%</p>
        <p>USAir said earnings rose an unexpectedly strong 57 percent, to $67.7 million on robust demand for international flights. $(D4.$)</p>
