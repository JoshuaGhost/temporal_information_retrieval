        <p>When Susan A. Christie teaches state employees about the new Federal welfare law, she clucks her tongue and moves her hand to imitate the action of a metronome.</p>
        <p>''You have got to hear that clock ticking,'' she said in a three-day workshop for 24 case managers. ''You must have a sense of urgency. There's a five-year lifetime limit on welfare under the new Federal law, a two-year limit for most families in South Carolina. We can't let them languish. Time is a-wasting.''</p>
        <p>The new law is forcing state officials to change the culture of welfare agencies around the country, shifting the focus from the determination of eligibility and the issuance of checks to employment and jobs. Unless welfare case managers make this change, the new law has no chance of success.</p>
        <p>For many case workers, as for many welfare recipients, the change will be traumatic. State employees  must now collaborate with welfare recipients and help them find jobs, a goal that may be thwarted if case workers are too paternalistic.</p>
        <p>Ms. Christie, the director of professional development at the American Public Welfare Association, an organization of state and local officials and welfare policy experts, hops around the country training employees in different states. She told her class here: ''We've been treating clients like children. But children don't get jobs. Children get taken care of by their parents. We must treat clients as adults, not as children. To tell people the new rules is a very adult thing to do.''</p>
        <p>Social service agencies, once a backwater of state government, have become a testing ground for the biggest experiment in social welfare policy since the New Deal.</p>
        <p>Striding round the classroom here with a purposeful, no-nonsense manner, Ms. Christie asked students: ''You know who's going to get people jobs under welfare reform? I'm looking at you! You should feel some weight on your shoulders. The President isn't going to get somebody a job. Congress isn't going to get somebody a job. There are folks in this country who don't think states can pull this off. But I do. You can make this piece of legislation come alive.''</p>
        <p>In state plans filed recently with the Federal Government, Arizona, Kentucky, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Utah all affirmed the need for cultural change.</p>
        <p>''Changing the culture of the welfare office to support work and self-sufficiency requires that the philosophy and purpose of the program change,'' the Utah plan said. ''Financial assistance is seen as a support service to enable adults to participate in employment-related activities, not as an entitlement.''</p>
        <p>James T. Clark, director of South Carolina's Department of Social Services, said: ''The biggest challenge for us is to change the culture, the bureaucracy, of welfare. Case workers here and throughout the country are disliked because we have treated clients in a demeaning, dispiriting way. We send clients a message that says, 'You're a loser, you can't make it, but that's all right because the Government will take care of you.' ''</p>
        <p>The number of people on welfare in South Carolina has declined 15 percent in the last two years, to 115,000. But in a sign of the new emphasis on results, Mr. Clark recently told social service directors in 8 of the state's 46 counties that their performance was unsatisfactory, in part because they had not placed enough welfare recipients in jobs.</p>
        <p>Under the old law, Ms. Christie said, case workers could tell poor people, in effect: ''I'm the boss. I have the money. I have something you want.'' And for many case managers, she says, ''it's very painful to give up that kind of power.''</p>
        <p>In Washington, Federal officials are still debating the merits of the new welfare law. Some liberal Democrats still express outrage because they see the law as unjust or immoral, a betrayal of the nation's obligation to the poor. State officials, especially those on the front lines, do not have the luxury of criticizing the new policy. They are supposed to make it work, and their concerns are intensely practical.</p>
        <p>Elizabeth E. Miller, a case manager for South Carolina's Department of Social Services in rural Barnwell, is trying to figure out how welfare recipients will get to jobs because ''we have no public transportation, no taxis, no buses.''</p>
        <p>Lawerence Jackson, a case manager in Bishopville, S.C., said: ''The paperwork keeps growing and growing. In addition to the old forms for determining eligibility, we now have a whole new set of paperwork for welfare reform -- employment plans, individual self-sufficiency plans, referrals to job clubs and so on.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, case managers still have all the old duties: interviewing applicants, verifying income and expenses, assessing eligibility, visiting welfare recipients in their homes.</p>
        <p>In the past, welfare mothers were entitled to public assistance regardless of whether they worked, but under the new law, they must work within two years of receiving aid.</p>
        <p>Charlene D. Garner, a case manager in Charleston, S.C., said, ''A lot of people seem to think they're owed that money.''</p>
        <p>And Ms. Christie asked: ''Why shouldn't they think that? We've called it an entitlement. But it's not an entitlement anymore.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Christie, a former welfare official in Utah and Colorado, tells case workers here that the behavior of welfare recipients is not right or wrong, good or bad, except as it helps or hinders them in getting jobs.</p>
        <p>''Think of your clients as unemployed people, not as welfare mommas,'' she said. ''Make work the pre-eminent theme of all your interactions with clients.''</p>
        <p>Case managers seem to have heard the message. They celebrate each success. ''When a client gets a job, we all holler and scream, the whole office,'' Ms. Miller said.</p>
        <p>Although the Federal law sets a lifetime limit of five years on welfare payments to any family, states may set stricter limits. And South Carolina has chosen to do so, with a two-year limit for most families.</p>
        <p>Because welfare recipients ''go over the cliff in two years,'' Ms. Christie said, state agencies can no longer be slow in providing the services needed to get jobs. A welfare recipient who needs counseling from a ''job coach'' or instruction in English as a second language cannot wait six months, she said.</p>
        <p>John C. Walker, a welfare worker for 13 years, handles cases in Richland County, which includes Columbia. ''A family that's been on welfare for two or three generations will have real trouble finding jobs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Walker added: ''The concept behind these reforms should have been in place 20 years ago. The old welfare system fostered dependency. It was dehumanizing. It taught people to be liars and cheats. We've been kidding ourselves to think that people can live in Charleston, S.C., on $159 a month.'' That amount, the maximum public assistance payment for a two-person family in South Carolina, is less than one-third of the Federal poverty level.</p>
        <p>Through case studies and role-playing exercises, state employees learn how to coach welfare recipients who say, for example: ''I feel like a real loser. Nobody wants to hire me because of my bad hand.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Christie cautions case managers not to blame their clients. ''You don't get to say, 'I had bad clients, so I couldn't get them jobs,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>At the same time, she said, case managers must not be too paternalistic. ''In the name of protecting our clients,'' she said, ''we have marginalized them. Let's not be too quick to assume that they won't change their behavior in the new world order. If you have written off any of your clients, you can be sure they won't get work.''</p>
        <p>Under the Federal law, states may exempt 20 percent of welfare recipients from the five-year limit on public assistance. But Ms. Christie said: ''You cannot know who should be exempt when they walk in the door. If you work with them for two years, you may find that they don't need to be exempt.'' Thus, she said, it may be ''a self-fulfilling prophecy'' to classify anyone as unemployable.</p>
        <p>Ms. Christie told the case managers: ''You will be a role model for your clients, showing them how to be self-sufficient and deal with change.''</p>
        <p>When case managers were just issuing checks, they could treat all clients the same, Ms. Christie said. ''But under welfare reform,'' she said, ''every client needs a customized employment plan. You get jobs for people as individuals, one by one, not as a group.''</p>
