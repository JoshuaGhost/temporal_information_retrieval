        <p>Integrated Health Services Inc., a home health care and specialized nursing home company, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Coram Healthcare Corporation, a troubled, debt-laden home care company, for about $280 million in stock, creating one of the largest companies that provide care for patients whom hospitals no longer find profitable.</p>
        <p>''I'm betting the company'' on the expectation ''that major numbers of patients in hospitals will come into our system,'' said Robert N. Elkins, the chief executive of Integrated.</p>

        <p>Integrated Health Services Inc., a home health care and specialized nursing home company, said yesterday that it had agreed to buy the Coram Healthcare Corporation, a troubled, debt-laden home care company, for about $280 million in stock, creating one of the largest companies that provide care for patients whom hospitals no longer find profitable.</p>
        <p>''I'm betting the company'' on the expectation ''that major numbers of patients in hospitals will come into our system,'' said Robert N. Elkins, the chief executive of Integrated.</p>
        <p>With Coram, which specializes in providing intravenous drugs and nutrition at home, Integrated Health said it would have $2.5 billion in combined sales in 1997, up from about $1.2 billion in 1995, as well as increased earnings. Coram, which is based in Denver, reported losses in 1995 and again for the first half of this year, but Dr. Elkins said its finances were ''turning around.''</p>
        <p>Under the deal, Integrated, which is based in Owings Mills, Md., would assume $375 million in Coram debt, down from about $465 million now. Integrated has negotiated a settlement of lawsuits between Coram and Caremark Inc., which sold a home care business to Coram for $309 million last year.</p>
        <p>Caremark, which was later acquired by Medpartners Inc., a physician practice management company based in Birmingham, Ala., would write off $111 million that Coram still owes Caremark and accept $57.5 million of new two-year notes payable by Integrated.</p>
        <p>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, Coram's investment banker, would recoup the principal of a $150 million bridge loan it made to Coram in April 1995, but would receive only a relatively modest return, by investment banking standards, of $22 million, for a total of $172 million.</p>
        <p>Catherine Conroy, a spokeswoman for Donaldson, Lufkin, said, ''We think this is a good outcome, particularly when you consider many investment banks have recovered zero dollars from difficult bridge loans.''</p>
        <p>The transaction, which is expected to close early next year, would end the dream of James M. Sweeney, a home care entrepreneur who had hoped to build Coram into a giant with $2 billion in annual revenue.</p>
        <p>''Coram was put together with ashes from a bunch of other companies and loaded with debt,'' said Margo Vignola, a health care analyst with Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sweeney had founded Caremark as an intravenous home care business and sold it for $580 million in 1987 to Baxter Travenol, now known as Baxter International Inc. After buying the core of that business last year, Coram, which Mr. Sweeney formed in 1994, contended in a lawsuit that Caremark had overstated its value.</p>
        <p>Analysts credited Donald Amaral, a former hospital executive who is Coram's chief executive, with improving the company's finances and finding it a new home with Integrated. He will stay on as head of Coram for one year. ''Don stabilized revenues and improved cash flow,'' said Vivian Wohl, an analyst with Robertson Stephens. ''But in spite of that, I think the debt was more than Coram could handle.''</p>
        <p>Integrated grew by a robust 25 percent a year in the early 1990's on the strength of the specialized ''sub-acute'' care it provides in nursing homes for patients discharged from hospitals. Last year, the company said that its growth was slowing and that it would branch into home health care.</p>
        <p>Last week, Integrated said it had agreed to acquire a home care company, First American Health Care of Georgia Inc., for $154 million in cash plus contingent payments of up to $159 million. Under that deal, First American, which has been operating under protection of Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws, would eventually pay $255 million to the Government to settle Federal charges of Medicare fraud. The principal owners of First American, Jack Mills and his wife, Margie Mills, are serving prison sentences for Medicare fraud.</p>
        <p>The expanded Integrated would have 14 percent operating margins next year, before depreciation, debt and taxes, said Rob Mains, an analyst with Advest Securities. ''If they can integrate the home health care business with their other post-acute-care services, it puts Integrated ahead of its competitors,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Under the deal, which is subject to approval by shareholders and regulators, Coram stockholders would receive 0.2111 of a share of Integrated Health for each Coram share, or about $5.43 a share, based on Integrated's closing price of $25.75 on Friday. Integrated intends to issue 10.8 million new shares.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Integrated Health Services fell 62.5 cents, to $25.125, and Coram Healthcare rose 12.5 cents, to $5.</p>
