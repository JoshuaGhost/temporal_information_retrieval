        <p>Confronting polls that show President Clinton dominant in nearly every region of the country, senior aides to Bob Dole said today that they had tentatively decided to pour resources into California while pulling back in other important states like New Jersey and Ohio.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Dole met for about an hour with a handful of his closest advisers at the campaign's headquarters here on Saturday, participants said there was near unanimous agreement that they should make an all-out push for California.</p>
        <p>The strategy is considered risky, and the decision comes quite late for a national campaign: just three weeks before the election and at a time when Mr. Dole continues to trail the President in national polls by double-digit margins.</p>
        <p>This particular state-by-state strategy has been the subject of internal debate in the campaign for weeks and also comes as the campaign has been focusing in recent days on another crucial strategy: whether Mr. Dole should attack the President on the issues of ethics and character, particularly in the final Presidential debate on Wednesday in San Diego. $(Articles, page A14.$)</p>
        <p>At least 11 states, with 112 electoral votes, still appear too close to call, and a decision to compete vigorously in a state as big as California -- with a fifth of the electoral votes needed for victory -- means that the campaign would be diverting millions of dollars from some of those battlegrounds. But Dole aides said they were buoyed by the well-regarded Field Poll last week, which showed that Mr. Dole had cut Mr. Clinton's lead there to 10 points.</p>
        <p>The aides cautioned that Mr. Dole had not formally signed off on the electoral strategy decision and could always change course, and campaigns do sometimes try to mislead opponents on strategy.</p>
        <p>But the aides said Mr. Dole had indicated at the meeting that the California route made sense, and Jack Kemp, the Vice-Presidential candidate, and Speaker Newt Gingrich today both emphasized Republican chances in the state.</p>
        <p>One senior aide to Mr. Dole, speaking on the condition of anonymity, offered this view: ''The map that was presented to him was a California victory strategy. There seemed to be pretty much unanimity that California was the way to go. The pot of money is not unlimited, and it has to come from somewhere.''</p>
        <p>The Dole campaign faces these decisions because three weeks before the election, an analysis of the latest state polls and interviews with political professionals show that Mr. Clinton is overwhelming Mr. Dole in nearly every region except the narrow swath of the Great Plains that runs from North Dakota to Texas.</p>
        <p>The state-by-state numbers are telling because the race for the White House boils down to which contender can pile up 270 of the 538 Electoral College votes.</p>
        <p>An analysis by The New York Times found that 26 states, and the District of Columbia, now lean toward Mr. Clinton, for a total of 325 electoral votes; the 13 states favoring Mr. Dole amount to 101 electoral votes. The remaining 11 states appear too close to call. But even if Mr. Dole won all the tossup states, they would not put him over the top. Ross Perot appears to have little chance of winning any state.</p>
        <p>The aides to Mr. Dole contended that an aggressive campaign in California would cost about $4 million, much of which would have gone into Midwestern battlegrounds like Ohio and Illinois, as well as New Jersey. He is trailing by double digits in polls in all three states.</p>
        <p>Such a path would be a fundamental change because just today Mr. Dole campaigned in New Jersey and has campaigned there frequently. If the campaign decides to compete hard in California, it may not totally forfeit Ohio and New Jersey, but would most likely scale back sharply there, the aides said.</p>
        <p>Of those two states, aides said Mr. Dole appeared most enthusiastic about his prospects in Ohio. (New Jersey is seen as a bigger potential drain of resources because advertising in the New York market is much more expensive than elsewhere.) And while Mr. Dole has not been advertising in Illinois, aides said he would if he decided not to pursue the California plan.</p>
        <p>Scott Reed, the Dole campaign manager, said in an interview on Friday that he saw California as winnable.</p>
        <p>''We'll be fighting it out in half a dozen to eight battleground states, including California,'' Mr. Reed said. ''We're going for it.'' He said Mr. Dole could win if he captured ''California and the Midwest and a few cherry pickers in the Northeast.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reed cited New Hampshire, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware as ''all winnable -- all reachable.'' But Mr. Dole is well behind in the polls in all five states.</p>
        <p>In television interviews today, the strategy for California was championed by Mr. Gingrich, who sees an aggressive campaign there as a way for Republicans to retain control of the House of Representatives, and by Mr. Kemp, a native of the state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich, on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation,'' said: ''In California, Dole is only 10 points behind I think he'll carry California by 6 points on Election Day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kemp, on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' said from Irvine, Calif.: ''I'm in California, and we're down by 10. It is tightening in California, and we carry California and this election is over for Bill Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Although even Dole strategists conceded that closing the gap in California would be a mountainous task this close to the election, the picture is not encouraging in several large industrial states like Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where Mr. Dole is trailing by double digits.</p>
        <p>State polls show that Mr. Dole is decisively ahead only in pockets in the West and South that have long been Republican strongholds, but has yet to pull ahead in other traditional Republican bastions in those regions -- including Arizona, Florida and Virginia -- that for at least three decades had been pivotal to the party's so-called electoral lock.</p>
        <p>Charles E. Cook Jr., who publishes a nonpartisan political newsletter and who recently wrote an article about how Mr. Dole could win, said he could no longer make the case for a Dole victory. ''I would put Dole's chances of winning at less than 5 percent,'' Mr. Cook said. ''I don't see anything that could happen within the context of this campaign that would turn it around. He would have to capitalize on some external event like a foreign policy disaster and troops' coming home in body bags.''</p>
        <p>In a memorandum made public late last week by Mr. Reed, the Dole campaign manager, he took issue with such critiques.</p>
        <p>''The White House is desperately attempting to convince the press and the public that this election is already over,'' Mr. Reed said. ''They're trying as hard as possible to sit on the ball and run out the clock, hoping the American people won't take a close look at both candidates before making their decision. They're wrong.''</p>
        <p>Still, a state-by-state breakdown that Mr. Reed distributed with his memo -- though slightly more upbeat than the analysis by The Times -- underscored the struggle facing Mr. Dole: it said he was ahead in 15 states, with 123 electoral votes, compared with Mr. Clinton leading in 12 states, with 195 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>Although any campaign that was behind in so many states would have difficulty settling on where to direct resources, strategists in both parties criticize the Dole campaign for not settling on a clear state-by-state strategy and sticking to it.</p>
        <p>Peter Hart, who was Walter F. Mondale's pollster in the 1984 Presidential election, said even that losing campaign never sent the candidate in one direction and the television commercials in another.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing worse than being behind by double digits -- it's very difficult to put together a strategy,'' Mr. Hart said. ''But you have to have a certain discipline or you end up chasing your own tail instead of chasing an electoral victory.''</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Mondale's strategy, he won only his home state, Minnesota, and the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser to Mr. Clinton, speculated that despite little or no television advertising in Illinois and Wisconsin, Mr. Dole was still campaigning there to keep up appearances as a favor to the Republican Governors. Otherwise, Mr. Stephanopoulos said, ''these guys start yelling at you.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is so confident that his aides said he was weighing plans to do more campaigning in states that have long been considered safe Republican territory, including Texas, Alabama and Virginia.</p>
        <p>Even as Mr. Dole's advisers talk about competing in California, its Governor, Pete Wilson, who is Mr. Dole's campaign chairman in the state, groused about the Dole campaign's performance at a breakfast with reporters late last week.</p>
        <p>''Am I satisfied?'' Mr. Wilson said. ''No, I'm not satisfied. But no, I don't think the race is lost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson said Mr. Dole needed to hammer on issues like affirmative action and immigration, which were successful for the Governor in his re-election campaign in 1994.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson has only four of his own operatives among the two dozen Dole campaign workers in California and has had tense relations with Mr. Dole's top aides. The Governor expressed concern that strategists who were familiar with California politics did not have enough influence in the Washington-based Dole campaign.</p>
        <p>Asked whether they might gain more stature, Mr. Wilson replied, ''Hope springs eternal.''</p>
