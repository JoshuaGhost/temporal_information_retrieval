        <p>The Miami Dolphins were in two-deep coverage in the secondary, and, after this play, they were in trouble that looked way too deep to overcome. Receiver Andre Reed had given the Dolphins the old stop-and-go move, had caught the pass and, 49 yards later, had reached the Miami 2. Dolphins cornerback Terrell Buckley made the saving tackle. There was only 1 minute 55 seconds left. Miami's 14-7 lead looked lost.</p>
        <p>''Man, was that a high and then a low,'' Bills cornerback Thomas Smith said. ''I look up and we're at the 2 and I'm thinking this thing is going into overtime all the way. Why didn't we just run it in from there?''</p>

        <p>The Miami Dolphins were in two-deep coverage in the secondary, and, after this play, they were in trouble that looked way too deep to overcome. Receiver Andre Reed had given the Dolphins the old stop-and-go move, had caught the pass and, 49 yards later, had reached the Miami 2. Dolphins cornerback Terrell Buckley made the saving tackle. There was only 1 minute 55 seconds left. Miami's 14-7 lead looked lost.</p>
        <p>''Man, was that a high and then a low,'' Bills cornerback Thomas Smith said. ''I look up and we're at the 2 and I'm thinking this thing is going into overtime all the way. Why didn't we just run it in from there?''</p>
        <p>No, the Bills, after the gain to the 2, tried a pass. Intentional grounding on Jim Kelly, loss of down and the ball moved back to the Miami 12. Second down and an incomplete pass. A Thurman Thomas run for 2 yards on third down.</p>
        <p>Now it is fourth down from the Miami 10. There is a minute left.</p>
        <p>''I closed my eyes and listened to the crowd -- they would tell me what happened,'' said Buffalo running back Derrick Holmes, who was on the sideline during the fourth-down play. ''I heard a roar. And then I heard a groan. And then I looked up and saw their guy running the other way, right by our bench. I started to run out on the field and trip him.''</p>
        <p>Buckley, though, had already tripped up Reed, Kelly and the Bills.</p>
        <p>On that fourth-down play, Kelly tried to hit Reed on the right in the front corner of the end zone with a quick shot. But Buckley stepped in front, bobbled it and bobbled it some more before holding on and running 91 yards the other way into the end zone. That game-swinging play won it for Miami, 21-7, today before 79,642 disheartened fans at Rich Stadium.</p>
        <p>It helped Miami (4-2) avoid a three-game losing streak and helped them match the Bills' record in the American Conference East. Buffalo had won 17 of the last 21 in this series, so it reversed an ugly trend for Miami. It proved that the Dolphins could win without their injured quarterback, Dan Marino.</p>
        <p>And it proved to the Dolphins that often in the game of football, a reversal of fortune can lurk just around the corner.</p>
        <p>''They tried to hit me quick and I was prepared for it,'' Buckley said. ''This proves to us that hard work does pay off for us. We lost a close game at Indianapolis and then we fell flat and hard last week to Seattle. It looked like things were slipping away. We needed this. One thing God has blessed me with is speed, and I was able to catch Reed on that long play and that gave us a chance.''</p>
        <p>Dolphins tackle Tim Bowens said: ''If we hadn't won this game, our season might have fallen apart. It would have been more than a setback.''</p>
        <p>Marv Levy, the Bills' coach, was warning his players afterward not to let that happen to them. Levy told them that if they were tough, they would overcome this. There is plenty to overcome.</p>
        <p>Miami led, 7-0, at halftime and scored first in the third quarter to make it 14-0. Craig Erickson, the Miami quarterback, led two long drives for touchdowns that were capped by runs of 3 yards by Karim Abdul-Jabbar and of 1 yard by Irving Spikes. Erickson was 14 of 29 for 192 yards with no interceptions and with a long completion of 61 yards.</p>
        <p>Kelly struggled mightily. He was 21 of 32 for 247 yards with no touchdowns and three interceptions. He was sacked seven times for losses of 56 yards. It was Kelly's first game back from a hamstring injury that forced him to miss two Bills starts.</p>
        <p>Buffalo won the rushing battle, 105 yards to 63 yards (Thomas ran for 85 yards, including a 19-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter), but lost the turnover battle, 4-0. The Bills' Bruce Smith called it ''the most frustrating loss since I've been here.'' He has been here for 12 seasons.</p>
        <p>''The pass pattern was supposed to be in the right corner,'' Levy said of the first pass called at the Miami 2. ''No one missed an assignment on that play. I was the one that called the play. The pass is less likely to be expected on first down, compared to a later down. If it does not work, you should have run a different play.''</p>
        <p>This is what Kelly said about his performance: ''It seems that everything I tried to do today went the wrong way. I thought we were a lot better football team than we showed today. I take full responsibility for the offense not moving. I'm the quarterback and I'm supposed to make it happen and I didn't get it done. I let our team down today. I didn't hold up my end of the bargain.''</p>
