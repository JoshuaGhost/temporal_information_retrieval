        <p>Bjarne Riis, the Dane who won this year's Tour de France, watched with excitement today when the route and difficulties of the 1997 race were unveiled at a special presentation.</p>
        <p>And why not? Two days in the Pyrenees mountains, a long and hilly time trial and three days in the Alps will be packed into eight days of the three-week bicycle race.</p>
        <p>''It's going to take a strong man to win this Tour,'' Riis said, looking as if he thought himself just that man.</p>
        <p>The Tour will begin July 5 in Rouen, the city in Normandy that was home to the late Jacques Anquetil, who is one of four men to have won the race five times. After the customary short prologue, the Tour will proceed counterclockwise around France, covering roughly 2,400 miles, before it reaches its end in Paris on July 27. Of the 21 daily stages, excluding the prologue, 11 will be on the flat, with 8 of those consecutively before the Pyrenees are tackled on July 14 and 15. The Alps last from July 19 to 21.</p>
        <p>In addition to the time trial July 18 in St. Etienne, there will be another long individual race against the clock on July 26, starting at the Disneyland Paris theme park.</p>
