        <p>THE strident, message-heavy work of the Mexican muralists -- Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros and others -- had a lot of influence on American artists during the Depression-blasted 1930's. Among those affected was a small group of black artists interested not only in social reform but also in addressing their own racial identities. For them, the Mexicans' luridly polemical frescoes, paintings and prints, which glorified folk culture and lambasted the evils of capitalism and racism, had strong appeal as the basis for a ''language of protest.''</p>
        <p>The connections between the Mexicans and eight blacks inspired by them -- Charles Alston, John Biggers, Elizabeth Catlett, Sargent Claude Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Charles White, John Wilson and Hale Woodruff -- is the focus of ''In the Spirit of Resistance,'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem. But the show, organized by the American Federation of Arts with the Studio Museum and the Mexican Museum in San Francisco, begins with a serious handicap: the untransportable murals, not only those done by the Mexicans but those by the blacks as well, are exhibited only in dinky photo-reproductions. One live example makes an appearance here: Rivera's ''Proletarian Unity,'' a vast piece of agitprop from a multipart mural, dominated by Lenin, Stalin and Marx.</p>

        <p>THE strident, message-heavy work of the Mexican muralists -- Diego Rivera, Jose Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros and others -- had a lot of influence on American artists during the Depression-blasted 1930's. Among those affected was a small group of black artists interested not only in social reform but also in addressing their own racial identities. For them, the Mexicans' luridly polemical frescoes, paintings and prints, which glorified folk culture and lambasted the evils of capitalism and racism, had strong appeal as the basis for a ''language of protest.''</p>
        <p>The connections between the Mexicans and eight blacks inspired by them -- Charles Alston, John Biggers, Elizabeth Catlett, Sargent Claude Johnson, Jacob Lawrence, Charles White, John Wilson and Hale Woodruff -- is the focus of ''In the Spirit of Resistance,'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem. But the show, organized by the American Federation of Arts with the Studio Museum and the Mexican Museum in San Francisco, begins with a serious handicap: the untransportable murals, not only those done by the Mexicans but those by the blacks as well, are exhibited only in dinky photo-reproductions. One live example makes an appearance here: Rivera's ''Proletarian Unity,'' a vast piece of agitprop from a multipart mural, dominated by Lenin, Stalin and Marx.</p>
        <p>Dogma aside, Rivera's powerful visual harangues have much in common with pietistic religious painting. And along with the ''heroic'' style forged by other Mexican muralists -- a mix of indigenous Mexican art with Cubist, Futurist and other European modes -- they helped produce an unfortunate breed of American figuration known as Social Realism. In the service of a ''people's art,'' it often translated into flat-footed, cliche-ridden sentimentalities.</p>
        <p>There's egregious evidence of that here in the work of Charles White (1918-1979), whose considerable, Cubist-influenced graphic skills were put to banal use in such Social Realist lithographs as ''Negro Grief'' (1946) and a Rivera-like mural, ''The Contribution of the Negro to Democracy in America'' (1943).</p>
        <p>Far less pretentious was the output of the Taller de Grafica Popular, a print workshop founded in 1937 in Mexico City, which aimed at distributing its easily readable images, made by talented printmakers on cheap paper, to a popular audience. While her paintings and sculpture in the show are unexciting, Elizabeth Catlett (born in 1915), the only woman in the group, made some strong prints at the Taller, among them linoleum cuts celebrating the black heroines Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth. The angry prints on view here by Francisco Mora, a Mexican participant in the Taller and husband of Ms. Catlett, are also graphically effective.</p>
        <p>A quirkier talent is that of Sargent Claude Johnson (1888-1967), a sculptor and ceramist who, like others in the group, worked with the Federally sponsored Works Progress Administration art projects during the 1930's. Much taken with pre-Columbian sculpture, and cued by the call of the  Harlem Renaissance philosopher Alain Locke for an art based on African identity and Southern black folkways, Johnson produced witty, sophisticated work that ranges from jaunty interpretations of African masks to lithographs to small-scale figures. A lively example is the undated ''Young Girl,'' a Humpty-Dumptyish presence of flesh-painted plaster whose stylized, egg-shaped head sits in profile atop a rotund, abbreviated body with hands incised on its chest.</p>
        <p>But it's Jacob Lawrence (born 1917) -- exposed in his youth to mural-ese through W.P.A.-sponsored workshops and by his teacher, Charles Alston -- who really soared above the triteness of the genre. Combining a folk art approach with European modes in strongly designed compositions, he produced a remarkable series of narratives on black life and history. Too bad that only a few excerpts appear here: two gouaches from his ''Harlem Series,'' along with a wonderful small black-and-white lithograph of underground railroad escapees, and an engaging watercolor, ''Harlem'' (1946), that portrays a swank Harlem apartment building amid a crowd of tenements.</p>
        <p>The best thing to be said for ''In the Spirit of Resistance,'' whose guest curator is Lizzetta LeFalle-Collins, a dissertation fellow in the black studies department at the University of California at Santa Barbara, is that it offers a touching glimpse of a tough transitional time for American art and artists.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, it will come as news to the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation that Alston's W.P.A.-sponsored two-part mural, ''Magic and Medicine,'' made for the Harlem Hospital, has been ''removed,'' as Ms. LeFalle-Collins says in her catalogue essay. The mural was recently restored under the corporation's Adopt a Mural program and remains in its accustomed place in the Women's Pavilion of the hospital.</p>
        <p>''In the Spirit of Resistance: African-American Modernists and the Mexican Muralist School'' remains at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125th Street, through Dec. 1. The show then travels to the African-American Museum, Dallas, Jan. 3 to March 2, 1997; the Edsel and Eleanor Ford House, Grosse Pointe, Mich., March 26 to May 25; the California African-American Museum, Los Angeles, June 21 to Aug. 17; the Diggs Gallery, Winston-Salem (N.C.) State University, Sept. 12 to Nov. 8; the Dayton (Ohio) Art Institute, Dec. 13 to Feb. 1, 1998, and the Mexican Museum, San Francisco, Feb. 27 to April 26, 1998. The national tour is sponsored by Philip Morris.</p>
