        <p>The United States has shipped to Croatia most of $100 million worth of tanks and other weapons intended for Bosnia's military, but is refusing to turn over the materiel until the Bosnian Government agrees to certain conditions, including the dismissal of a military official accused of having ties to Iran, Clinton Administration officials said today.</p>

        <p>The United States has shipped to Croatia most of $100 million worth of tanks and other weapons intended for Bosnia's military, but is refusing to turn over the materiel until the Bosnian Government agrees to certain conditions, including the dismissal of a military official accused of having ties to Iran, Clinton Administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>The officials said the weapons, which arrived today aboard a chartered ship in Ploce, Croatia, would remain under the control of the United States until Bosnia's Deputy Minister of Defense, Hasan Cengic, resigned or was removed from office.</p>
        <p>The United States also demanded the dismissal of another military official, though not because of connections to Iran, and raised concerns with Bosnian leaders about the structure of the military and their control over it under the Bosnian-Croat federation called for by the Bosnian peace accords negotiated last year in Dayton, Ohio.</p>
        <p>The issue of Mr. Cengic once again raised questions about the extent of Iran's influence in Bosnia. During the war between Bosnia's Muslim-led Government and the Bosnian Serbs, Iran provided arms and soldiers to the Government. The Clinton Administration has encountered sharp criticism for its decision in 1994 not to object to the flow of Iranian arms despite an international arms embargo.</p>
        <p>The American arms shipment follows a smaller one in August, included 45 main battle tanks, 80 armed personnel carriers, 15 helicopters, antitank weapons and 45,000 automatic rifles.</p>
        <p>The shipment was to be unloaded over the next several days before being transferred to depots in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the officials said. They said they had received assurances that the Bosnians would agree to the conditions, allowing the arms to be turned over by November.</p>
        <p>The State Department's spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said today that the weapons would ''only be shipped to those storage sites when some remaining issues of concern to the United States are resolved on a satisfactory basis by the Bosnian Government in Sarajevo.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns declined to specify the concerns except to say that they related to the Government's commitment to abide by its agreements to gradually merge Muslim and Croat forces in Bosnia.</p>
        <p>One official said, however, that Mr. Cengic had developed close ties to Iran's Government as it helped arm the Bosnian Muslims. The official declined to discuss the objections to the other official or to name him. Another Administration official said the concerns with Mr. Cengic involved ''general unsavoriness.''</p>
        <p>Although it hopes to strengthen Bosnia's armed forces as a credible counter to the Bosnian Serb forces, the United States is wary about turning over sophisticated heavy weapons -- including the modern M-60 tanks -- without assurances that Bosnia has severed its ties to Iran and has routed out corrupt or inept military leaders.</p>
        <p>''We intend this to stabilize Bosnia, not destabilize it,'' one official said, referring to the program to train an army of Muslims and Croats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burns said at a news conference at the State Department that the American envoy overseeing the program, James Pardew, had raised the issue today in meetings with Bosnia's President, Alija Izetbegovic, and other officials in Sarajevo.</p>
        <p>''We expect that once the Bosnian Government has taken these steps that we are requesting, then this equipment at Ploce will be transferred,'' he said.</p>
