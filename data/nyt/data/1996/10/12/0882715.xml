        <p>Britain's tabloid press falls into greater disrepute when The Sun is hoodwinked into reporting on a faked videotape purporting to show Princess Diana cavorting in her underwear with a lover and the News of the World reportedly offers to pay up a woman pregnant with octuplets up to $150,000 for each live baby she delivers, despite doctors' warnings that by trying to keep all eight babies she would almost surely jeopardize them all; both papers are owned by Rupert Murdoch; photos (M)</p>

        <p>Even by their own dubious standards, Britain's downmarket tabloids may have descended to a new low in sleaze in the last few weeks, setting off a fresh round of attacks, counterattacks and flagellation from politicians, the public and even the papers themselves.</p>

        <p>Even by their own dubious standards, Britain's downmarket tabloids may have descended to a new low in sleaze in the last few weeks, setting off a fresh round of attacks, counterattacks and flagellation from politicians, the public and even the papers themselves.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday the country was transfixed when The Sun, a Rupert Murdoch-owned daily newspaper with a circulation of 11 million, published ''Di Spy Video Scandal: She's Filmed in Bra and Pants Romp With Hewitt.'' The article described a mysterious videotape that purported to show the Princess of Wales cavorting in her underwear several years ago with James Hewitt, her lover at the time.</p>
        <p>The country's other newspapers, tabloids as well as what the British call ''quality papers,'' duly splashed the story across their front pages, too. And ''The News at Ten,'' a usually sober evening news program on ITV, one of the BBC's commercial competitors, broadcast The Sun's grainy videotape, which showed a hazy blond woman stripping into a sports bra and bicycle shorts and riding around on the shoulders of a hazy dark-haired man.</p>
        <p>To justify their coverage of a story so obviously prurient -- and so beside the point, because both the Princess and Mr. Hewitt had already admitted to having had an affair -- the papers said the existence of the tape raised serious questions about royal security. The tape also seemed to lend credence, they said, to Diana's claim that, during her marriage she had been routinely spied on by M.I.5, the British internal security agency.</p>
        <p>Ensconced in their party conference in the resort town of Bournemouth, several Conservative Members of Parliament quickly seized the opportunity to denounce intrusions into the royal family's privacy, a popular stance that soon proved embarrassingly precipitous as events overtook perceptions.</p>
        <p>By the end of the day, the story had blown up in The Sun's face when two women who make their living as Diana look-alikes came forward to say that their bodies, their faces and their underwear were pictured in the video (the male figure was apparently an actor, identified only as Gareth). And Diana herself declared that the woman in the video couldn't have been her, because she had begun her workout regimen only after she and Mr. Hewitt broke up and so had no underwear of that sort at that time.</p>
        <p>The Sun offered an abject apology to its readers for falling victim ''to one of the most elaborate hoaxes of the decade,'' but its competitors could not conceal their delight.</p>
        <p>Speaking of Stuart Higgins, The Sun's editor, the downmarket Daily Mirror (motto: ''Honesty, Quality, Excellence'') declared, ''However low he grovels, it won't be enough to right this wrong.''</p>
        <p>And The Daily Telegraph, which is sympathetic to the royal family, cheerfully confessed to the pleasure it derived from another paper's misfortune. ''It would take a heart of stone not to laugh at The Sun's discomfiture,'' it said, before fulminating against tabloid ethics.</p>
        <p>''We have tended to forget that the tabloid approach to the royal family is one of the ugliest features of our age,'' the paper said in an editorial, ''even though it is true that some members of the family have themselves courted disaster.''</p>
        <p>The fake-video incident would not have seemed so bad, perhaps, if it had not occurred on the heels of another unpleasant tabloid incident. This time it concerned a 31-year-old woman who took fertility drugs, became pregnant with octuplets and did what seems almost de rigueur these days for Britons who smell cash: hire a publicist.</p>
        <p>The News of the World, a Murdoch-owned Sunday tabloid that specializes in celebrity scoops, seized on the story. It reportedly offered to pay the pregnant woman, Mandy Allwood, up to $150,000 for each live baby she delivered, despite doctors' warnings that by trying to keep all eight babies she would almost surely jeopardize them all.</p>
        <p>''She doesn't want to gain financially for herself,'' said Phil Hall, the paper's editor. ''If she had a miscarriage or changed her mind about going through with the pregnancy, we would pay her a small amount. But certainly we're not going to pay her a large sum of money, and she's aware of that.''</p>
        <p>''The News of the World,'' Mr. Hall said, ''isn't a charity.''</p>
        <p>Whatever The News of the World was, said Roger Gale, chairman of the Tory backbenchers' media committee, it should be reported to the Press Complaints Commission. As someMembers of Parliament called for an investigation of fertility programs, Mr. Gale denounced the paper's deal with Ms. Allwood as ''quite revolting and quite improper.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the newspaper's readers were treated to soap-opera reports about how the pregnancy was progressing, including updates on the behavior of Ms. Allwood's sometime boyfriend, who already had two children by another girlfriend and who was seen propositioning a third woman at a gas station.</p>
        <p>The News of the World's involvement in the case -- which ended last week, when Ms. Allwood miscarried all eight babies -- left the nation's more serious newspapers professing to be shocked, shocked. But even as they denounced ''checkbook journalism,'' the newspapers made sure to report each new development.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, doctors howled about medical ethics and, as everyone does in the end, blamed the news media.</p>
        <p>''If you have a pregnancy with eight fetuses, and you add to that the fact that every decision you take is going to be scrutinized and questioned and talked about by politicians, your family, other groups and the world's media, then it is even more stressful,'' said one of Ms. Allwood's doctors, Kypros Nicolaides. He urged the press to stay away from his patient -- even as he spoke to the press himself.</p>
