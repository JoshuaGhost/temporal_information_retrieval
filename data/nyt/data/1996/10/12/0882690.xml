        <p>This year's New York Film Festival concludes with ''The People vs. Larry Flynt,'' a blazing, unlikely triumph about a man who is nobody's idea of a movie hero. Smart, funny, shamelessly entertaining and perfectly serious too, Milos Forman's film describes the Hustler publisher and his many liberties, civil and otherwise. Above all, the film emerges as an object lesson in open-mindedness, winning a reluctant respect for its main character's right to crude self-expression just as Mr. Flynt has won his days in court.</p>
        <p>''I would love to be remembered for something meaningful,'' opines the film's Larry Flynt, played with devilish charm by Woody Harrelson as a maverick vulgarian who embodies capitalism at its most unabashed, tapping into something shocking but real in the American spirit. Thanks to the acerbic wit and crusading intelligence of Mr. Forman's film, he actually will.</p>
        <p>This film's savvy treatment of a potentially unpalatable character is on a par with that of ''Ed Wood,'' also written superbly by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. These writers make their mark so fast that the prologue to ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' is enough to dispel doubt. In the backwoods of Kentucky in 1952, ambitious little Larry is seen peddling moonshine to a quivering old drunk, who hands the boy what looks like his last $2. Nobody forces him; he hands that money over willingly. It's free enterprise even if it isn't pretty.</p>
        <p>Larry next throws a jug at his sleeping father, accusing him of drinking up the profits. He's no angel.</p>
        <p>By the early 1970's, at the start of a career that this lean and eventful film turns into a flamboyant roller-coaster ride, Larry is running a dismal little strip club in Cincinnati. Here and throughout the film, Mr. Forman uses humor expertly to deflate sensationalism without avoiding the essence of Larry's big marketing idea. The film includes some nudity but handles it with what, under the circumstances, looks like remarkable discretion.</p>
        <p>Hustler magazine is born soon after Larry meets Althea Leasure, the young bisexual stripper who joins Larry on the road to success. Courtney Love, who makes a smashing Althea, marches purposefully into the film and makes it clear that Mr. Harrelson's Larry has met his match. As eager and uninhibited as Larry is, Ms. Love's sultry, funny Althea is soon a loud voice among the seedy cronies who join in his new publishing venture. The film's scenes describing their creative efforts are as amusing as the movie-making episodes in ''Ed Wood.''</p>
        <p>Althea, proposing a pornographic photo spread based on ''The Wizard of Oz'': ''And there's Toto maybe, even?''</p>
        <p>One co-worker: ''Althea, I think maybe some things are sacred.''</p>
        <p>Larry: ''Shut up! Althea, that is the best thing I ever heard!''</p>
        <p>Once ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' has had its mischievous fun describing the crassness behind Hustler, it takes on its real subject: the question of why a free society need tolerate provocations like this. Edward Norton, so good in ''Primal Fear,'' articulates the film's cogent if not really controversial First Amendment arguments as he plays a composite character, the long-suffering lawyer who defends Mr. Flynt on a wide range of charges.</p>
        <p>''I'm your dream client!'' Flynt insists, after the lawyer quits in protest over his obnoxious courtroom antics. ''I'm the most fun, I'm rich and I'm always in trouble.''</p>
        <p>The real Mr. Flynt plays a judge in one scene, sitting near Mr. Harrelson just long enough to remind the audience that a beaming, attractive Larry Flynt is very much a movie invention. But the film stops prettifying its main character as it depicts the shooting that left him paralyzed from the waist down, his subsequent drug addiction with Althea in Bel Air (''I ought to move to a place where perverts are welcome!'' Larry decides, as the film cuts to the mountainside Hollywood sign) and his various run-ins with devout Christianity.</p>
        <p>One of the odder tangents to this story is Mr. Flynt's encounter with Ruth Carter Stapleton, President Jimmy Carter's sister (played by Donna Hanover, Mayor Giuliani's wife). Larry is influenced by her just long enough to have an epiphany (''Where'd you learn that damn word?'' Althea asks suspiciously) and devote Hustler disastrously to religious porn.</p>
        <p>(Sample idea: ''Adam and Eve getting it on in the Garden of Eden.'') Later on, Larry's baiting of the Rev. Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul) creates the case that brings this film to its logical destination:  the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' is a film that can comfortably accommodate both Justice Scalia's comments on satire and libel and the loony, trashy extravagance of the Flynts living high on the hog. Patrizia von  Brandenstein's production design is a marvel of bad taste rendered beautifully, and the costumes by Theodore Pistek and Arianne Phillips are fittingly bold.</p>
        <p>Mr. Flynt, after all, is a man who wore a star-spangled diaper for one court appearance. When Althea goes to seed, she begins looking more and more like Courtney Love, but Ms. Love's performance is far too good to confuse one well-tended image with the other.</p>
        <p>Philippe Rousselot's expert cinematography gives this film's wide range of settings a glamorous consistency. Among the actors whose deadpan delivery keeps the film at a witty distance from its hero are Brett Harrelson, Vincent Schiavelli, Crispin Glover and Miles Chapin as Larry's dim, shock-proof employees. James Carville feigns indignation as a prosecutor horrified by Hustler. James Cromwell plays Charles Keating, who accuses Larry Flynt of ''the destruction of the soul of our country'' while himself playing an instrumental role in the savings and loan scandal.</p>
        <p>The film knows which is worse.</p>
        <p>''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' will be shown tomorrow night at 8:30 at the New York Film Festival.</p>
