        <p>Pro football, an unforgiving sport, can also be redemptive. So on Sunday, when the Jets play host to the Oakland Raiders, Nick Lowery will be going for the National Football League career record in field goals.</p>
        <p>Lowery has 371. Jan Stenerud -- the man he replaced at Kansas City in 1980 -- booted 373. If the Jets' offense has finally stirred, Lowery could get three chances to break the mark against the Raiders.</p>

        <p>Pro football, an unforgiving sport, can also be redemptive. So on Sunday, when the Jets play host to the Oakland Raiders, Nick Lowery will be going for the National Football League career record in field goals.</p>
        <p>Lowery has 371. Jan Stenerud -- the man he replaced at Kansas City in 1980 -- booted 373. If the Jets' offense has finally stirred, Lowery could get three chances to break the mark against the Raiders.</p>
        <p>The Raiders have been present for other milestones in Lowery's career. When the Jets dropped him in 1978, he landed with the Patriots. In his first game, he faced the Raiders. Then, after losing his Patriots' job and sitting out all of 1979, he latched onto the Chiefs in 1980. His first game found him against the Raiders, too.</p>
        <p>This season, Lowery didn't get a chance at a field goal until the third game -- and that at 49 yards. But by hitting his last three against the Redskins last Sunday, Lowery has brought his career average back to 80.3 percent -- the highest in history.</p>
        <p>The 40-year-old Lowery received a good-luck missive from Nolan Ryan, who pointed out, ''I pitched some of my best games came after I turned 40, including one of my no-hitters.''</p>
        <p>When 1-10 Teams Meet</p>
        <p>The Jets and Raiders have the worst won-lost stretch over the last 11 games: 1-10. But the Jets have dropped nine in a row dating to last season.</p>
        <p>Victor Green probably will return to strong safety, after injuring his left quadriceps during Thursday's drills and sitting out Friday.</p>
        <p>Defensive end Anthony Smith returned to the Raiders on Friday, nearly a week after announcing he was leaving the team, but he will not play against the Jets.</p>
