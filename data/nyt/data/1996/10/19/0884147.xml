        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In an Oct. 4 letter, Robert Richter says he is filming a documentary and had spoken to three people from  Latin American countries ''who all link torture training to the United States Army's School of the Americas.'' Yet, during an interview with me in July, he presented none of this evidence.</p>
        <p>In his letter, Mr. Richter attests correctly that I told him in July that I did not condone the use of any improper instruction material.</p>
        <p>His question at the time stemmed from a single passage in a late June report referring to the past use of such material at the School of the Americas. I have since learned of a 1991-92 Defense Department investigation that determined that three manuals, out of some 300 manuals issued annually, at the school from 1989 to 1991 contained isolated objectionable material.</p>
        <p>The Defense Department and the Army condemned the language and ordered the manuals destroyed, sending a clear message about human rights policy and standards, and to prevent any recurrence. The Defense Department and Army leadership today strongly endorse that past judgment and corrective action. At this time, the safeguards on the curriculum are being reviewed yet again.</p>
        <p>In the July interview, I emphatically urged Mr. Richter to present to me or any other official any evidence he had, credible or otherwise, concerning any allegation of improper teaching. I made a specific commitment to him that any evidence would be fully investigated, and I repeated that commitment in a recent letter to him.</p>
        <p>He has offered no evidence to me to date, nor to my knowledge has he presented evidence to any other official. Instead, he has chosen to make allegations in the press, citing unnamed sources. We continue to urge Mr. Richter to provide substance for his allegations, instead of maligning the many outstanding graduates of this school, whose curriculum, all  in Spanish, is regarded as the best  of any military institution in the world in its coverage of human  rights.</p>
