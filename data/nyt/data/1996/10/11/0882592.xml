        <p>The Queens boy who kissed a classmate and became part of a national furor over the meaning of sexual harassment has become the subject of a new dispute over discipline between local school officials and the central school administration.</p>
        <p>School officials in Queens said they tried to suspend the boy, De'Andre Dearinge, after he bit and punched a teacher and a classroom aide at his Far Rockaway elementary school on Tuesday, but were blocked from doing so by the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>The officials, of District 27, which includes Far Rockaway, say they are being prevented from disciplining him because of unreasonable scrutiny after the widely publicized kissing incident two weeks ago. In that case, the 7-year-old boy's acting principal suspended him for sexual harassment after he kissed a second-grade girl and tore a button off her skirt. The suspension was lifted when the case hit the newspapers.</p>
        <p>The conflict also plunges the school officials into another vexing educational issue: how to discipline students with learning disabilities. Because the boy attends a special class for help with reading, he is classified as a special education student and cannot be suspended without permission from the central board. District 27 officials said they sought that permission on Wednesday and were denied it. The principal, Gerri Perriott, did not seek permission when she suspended the child for sexual harassment.</p>
        <p>Local school officials said the boy's special education status and the problems with the first suspension, which came days after a 6-year-old North Carolina boy was suspended for kissing a girl, made it difficult for them to respond responsibly to the biting and punching incident.</p>
        <p>''These people down at the Board of Education should go out and work in community schools several times a year,'' said James B. Egan, the president of School Board 27. ''People in the ivory tower have lost touch with what's going on in the schools.''</p>
        <p>Chiara Coletti, a Board of Education spokeswoman, refused to comment on the latest incident, at Public School 104, saying ''that boy has had enough publicity.'' She reiterated Chancellor Rudy Crew's position on the first suspension, saying the action was ''inappropriate and lacked common sense.'' She said Dr. Crew had urged the local district to reprimand the principal, Ms. Perriott, and place a letter in her personnel file.</p>
        <p>The local officials have said they regretted calling the kiss sexual harassment, but also defended the principal's decision to suspend the boy, who they said had a history of disciplinary problems and had been involved in at least two other incidents since the start of the school year.</p>
        <p>Brenda Isaacs, Superintendent of District 27, said she would take ''appropriate action'' against the principal for violating suspension procedures. But she added: ''There is an inordinate amount of pressure because of the media hype. The media has had such an influence on this situation that it is totally divorced from the issue of holding a child accountable for his actions.''</p>
        <p>Members of De'Andre's family did not return telephone calls yesterday seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, local school officials said they resented the pressure the Chancellor's office had put on them to reprimand the principal and not to discipline De'Andre. ''The Chancellor ought to realize that this is not about disciplining the principal, it's about disciplining a child,'' Mr. Egan said. ''That's what the Chancellor should be giving his sound bites about. Just because a kid has a reading disability doesn't mean he's allowed to express himself in any way he sees fit, by biting and punching.''</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials declined to discuss details of the boy's case, saying only that the Office of Special Education, which oversees programs for the city's 130,000 special education students, evaluated each suspension request individually. ''A major factor is a child's age and maturity and whether there was intent to commit a certain act,'' said Robin S. Greenfield, the Chancellor's deputy legal counsel.</p>
        <p>But even when the board decides that a special education student's behavior warrants suspension, school officials are often constrained by Federal laws that restrict the ability of school districts to expel or suspend students with disabilities.</p>
        <p>Federal rules prohibit students with physical, mental, emotional or learning disabilities from being suspended for more than 10 days a school year if parents object. That has meant that even students engaging in dangerous behavior cannot easily be removed from schools.</p>
        <p>''It can be a nightmare for principals and teachers,'' said Gwendolyn Gregory, deputy chief counsel for the National School Boards Association. ''They're trying to educate kids and deal with social pressures and parents and they're often told they can't remove a disruptive kid.''</p>
