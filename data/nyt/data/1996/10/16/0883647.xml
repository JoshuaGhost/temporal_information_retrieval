        <p>Prof John Y Simon letter comments on Oct 11 article on Vice Presidential debate between Al Gore and Jack Kemp (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jack Kemp, the Republican Vice-Presidential contender, opened his debate with Vice President Al Gore with the statement that ''Abraham Lincoln put it best when he said you serve your party best by serving the nation first'' (debate excerpts, Oct. 11).</p>
        <p>But it was President Rutherford B. Hayes who said, at his inauguration in 1877, that although the President owed his election to a political party, ''he serves his party best who serves the country best.''</p>

        <p>Mr. Kemp attributes the sentiment to the wrong President and alters its meaning by changing the final words of the quotation. Mr. Kemp would better serve his party and his country by getting his quotations straight.</p>
