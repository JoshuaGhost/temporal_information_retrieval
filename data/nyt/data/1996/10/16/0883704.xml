        <p>The last time Wade Boggs played in a World Series, the decisive game ended with him sitting in the dugout at Shea Stadium with his head in his lap and tears pouring down his ruddy face after the Mets squashed the Red Sox.</p>
        <p>He had lost the biggest baseball game of his career just four months after his mother died in a freakish car accident and his emotions overwhelmed him. He cried and cried.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to go home,'' Boggs recalled. ''I had just buried my mother in June, and I knew that baseball was the release I had from that. I was hoping we could continue to play forever. I knew the last out was the finality of having to go back home and having to walk through that door and not see my mother. That sort of crushed me.''</p>
        <p>As Boggs talked about returning to the World Series for the first time in 10 years with the American League champion Yankees, the other New York team, he cannot stop thinking about how the Red Sox lost their opportunity for a ring and cannot stop thinking about his mother, Sue.</p>
        <p>Boggs was in the visiting clubhouse at Yankee Stadium on June 17, 1986, when the phone rang. It was his niece, Rebecca Morrison, telling him that his mother had been killed when a cement truck operator, who Boggs said was 50 miles from where he was supposed to be, barreled into her car. She died instantly. A piece of Boggs died, too.</p>
        <p>''Every time I think about my mother, I think about the World Series,'' Boggs said. ''That was '86 when she died and I knew how much it would have meant to her to have gone to that. All the days she took me to Little League practices and grew up with me. That would have been her prize. Some idiot snuffed it out.''</p>
        <p>Boggs stared at the carpet in front of his locker as he spoke about his mother, a women's air corps pilot in World War II. The World Series is back in New York. And Sue Boggs is in her son's mind more than ever.</p>
        <p>''She was 63,'' he said. ''Her birthday was the next day. I had to buy her a coffin for her birthday.''</p>
        <p>He thought about 1986 again, and said: ''When you're playing between the white lines, you forget about everything. Once Jesse Orosco threw the glove up in the air, that was the last straw. I thought about her.''</p>
        <p>Since the subject was the 1986 World Series, the questions inevitably strayed to first baseman Bill Buckner's unforgettable error on Mookie Wilson's dribbling grounder in the bottom of the 10th inning in Game 6. The ball slithered between Buckner's legs, the Mets won the game, eventually won the Series by winning Game 7 and Buckner solidified his unenviable place in baseball history.</p>
        <p>''No one was blaming anybody,'' Boggs said. ''Everyone had a hand in it. It just so happened the ball went to Billy Buck. The ball could have gone to me and gone through my legs. No one blamed anybody. It's fate.''</p>
        <p>Boggs said that before that inning started, the third base umpire Harry Wendelstedt had asked Boggs for his cap because the umpire collected them from World Series winners. Boggs told him the game was not over yet. He was right. Buckner's gaffe was moments away.</p>
        <p>''You don't blame him for that and other individuals shouldn't, either,'' Boggs said. ''Anyone who does that is selfish because they wanted to win the World Series so badly.''</p>
        <p>Now the 38-year-old Boggs, who is a paltry 3 for 27 in this post-season, wants to win it badly. So badly that he admitted, ''a day hasn't gone in the last 10 years that I don't think about 1986.''</p>
        <p>After his mother died, Boggs traveled back to Tampa, Fla., with his father, Win, for the funeral. They consoled each other on the flight. After the Red Sox succumbed in stunning fashion to the Mets, Win sat in his living room and consoled his son for three hours. Now Boggs is back in the World Series and his father will be at Game 1 at Yankee Stadium on Saturday.</p>
        <p>''It'll be for him, too,'' Boggs said. ''This is the greatest thing a father could ever ask for is to have a son in the World Series. I know that it was probably so painful for him in '86 that we had lost.''</p>
        <p>And his mother? ''She'll be here,'' Boggs said. ''She'll be here.''</p>
