        <p>THOMAS MUSTER, who stomped off the court during a Davis Cup match with Brazil and called the fans ''animals,'' will go to London on Oct. 7 to argue his case before the International Tennis Federation.</p>
        <p>Muster, the world's No. 3-ranked player, will be joined by his coach, RONALD LEITGEB, and Austrian teammates and officials.</p>
        <p>''We are preparing to fight,'' CHRISTIAN RANSMAYR, vice president of the Austrian Tennis Federation, told The Associated Press yesterday in Vienna.</p>
        <p>Muster left the court on Sept. 21 when he and his doubles partner trailed, 0-2, 15-30, in the fifth set in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The Austrian complained that fans had cursed and spit at him. He said they threw things at him and blinded him with a mirror. He contended security was insufficient for him to continue playing.</p>
        <p>The Austrians forfeited the match and the series when they refused to play the remaining two singles, losing by 4-1.</p>
        <p>Muster has been fined about $8,000 by the I.T.F. for leaving the court and making an obscene gesture. Austria has appealed that decision.</p>
