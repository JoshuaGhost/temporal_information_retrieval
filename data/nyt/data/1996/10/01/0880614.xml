        <p>NEW YORK</p>
        <p>Kmart Meets the Enemy</p>
        <p>From the Manhattan-centered view of the universe, Kmart has long been one of the big symbols of the world Out There, a caricature of strip mall culture at its height, or depth. Kmart, in turn, ignored Manhattan completely. Manhattan was antithesis, everything that Kmart was not, lacking everything that had made the Kmart formula work everywhere else. Now, Manhattan has become a critical element in the company's plans for a rebirth. $(Page A1.$)</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner's Quiet Side</p>
        <p>As the Yankees prepared for the playoffs, at least part of the jabber among the city's jabbering baseball fans was about George M. Steinbrenner 3d, the team's principal owner, who -- unlike previous years -- has let his manager and general manager do the talking for the team. The question is: Has he mellowed? $(B1.$)</p>
        <p>New Challenge on Welfare Law</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani significantly broadened his attack on the new Federal welfare law, saying that the denial of social services to legal immigrants was both morally wrong and unconstitutional. The Mayor accused Congress and President Clinton of trying to limit immigration by making the lives of immigrants miserable. $(B1.$)</p>
        <p>Thirteen months before he seeks re-election, the Mayor is leading his potential rivals, a poll finds. $(B7.$)</p>
        <p>In Central Park, a Hunt</p>
        <p>After selling both their vacation homes to consolidate their lives in the city, George and Catherine Parry longed for the water sports they both love. Then, as they gazed upon the Central Park Reservoir from their Fifth Avenue apartment, the couple hit upon an idea to fill the void. Wearing full scuba gear, they are working to clear more than a century's worth of garbage from the reservoir. $(B1.$)</p>
        <p>Soup Kitchens in a Struggle</p>
        <p>The Rev. William Greenlaw can't really explain it, but for about the last six weeks -- coincidentally or not the period since President Clinton signed the welfare-overhaul law -- lines have grown a lot longer at the soup kitchen he runs out of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Apostles. Even before the sweeping changes, soup kitchens and pantries were struggling to keep pace with a sharp rise in demand. NYC by Clyde Haberman. $(B1.$)</p>
        <p>Criticism Among Labor Leaders</p>
        <p>Stanley Hill, the head of the city's largest municipal union was criticized by fellow labor leaders for failing to win more concessions from Mayor Giuliani before the city expands its workfare program. $(B3.$)</p>
        <p>School Ready for Opening Day</p>

        <p>Guard Testifies in Fisher Suit</p>
        <p>Testifying in a civil suit, a prison guard denied allegations that they had an affair with Amy Fisher in 1993. Miss Fisher, who is serving 5 to 15 years for shooting the wife of a former boyfriend, Joey Buttafuoco, has sued to be transferred to the Federal prison system. $(B5.$)</p>
        <p>Criticism on City Contracts</p>
        <p>The City Comptroller raised new questions about how the Giuliani administration awards millions of dollars in contracts, contending that mental health officials had ignored guidelines intended to prevent mismanagement and patronage. City Hall said the criticism was inaccurate. $(B6.$)</p>
        <p>Arraignment in Child's Death</p>
        <p>Carla Lockwood pleaded not guilty to murder charges stemming from the starvation death of her 4-year-old daughter, Nadine. $(B7.$)</p>
        <p>CONNECTICUT</p>
        <p>Jury Selection in Rape Trial</p>
