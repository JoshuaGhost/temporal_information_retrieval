      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial backs gun-control legislation that was included in continuing budget resolution passed by Congress, and lauds Pres Clinton and Sen Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, measure's chief sponsor, for standing firm against last-minute Republican effort to weaken 'this worthy measure'</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The continuing budget resolution just approved by Congress contains a sensible piece of gun-control legislation aimed at preventing spouse-beaters and child-abusers from purchasing or owning guns. President Clinton and the measure's chief sponsor, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, deserve credit for standing firm against a last-minute Republican effort to weaken this worthy measure.</p>
        <p>The bill plugs a big hole in existing gun laws. Although the laws bar convicted felons from possessing or buying guns, they did not successfully block the possession of guns by people convicted of spousal or child abuse, since those acts of domestic violence often are prosecuted as misdemeanors.</p>

        <p>The continuing budget resolution just approved by Congress contains a sensible piece of gun-control legislation aimed at preventing spouse-beaters and child-abusers from purchasing or owning guns. President Clinton and the measure's chief sponsor, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, deserve credit for standing firm against a last-minute Republican effort to weaken this worthy measure.</p>
        <p>The bill plugs a big hole in existing gun laws. Although the laws bar convicted felons from possessing or buying guns, they did not successfully block the possession of guns by people convicted of spousal or child abuse, since those acts of domestic violence often are prosecuted as misdemeanors.</p>
        <p>Legislation containing the domestic-violence gun ban passed the Senate in July, but was blocked by the Republican House leadership in an apparent cave-in to the National Rifle Association. The Senate approved the measure again in mid-September by an overwhelming vote of 97 to 2.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gingrich and the Republican Congressional leadership then concocted a far weaker version of the bill that would have exempted from the gun ban any abuser convicted in a trial before a judge, as opposed to a jury. That exemption would have allowed the vast majority of spouse-beaters and child-abusers to have guns. Mr. Gingrich and his colleagues finally backed down, but only after the White House and Mr. Lautenberg made plain they would hold up the budget deal if necessary to pass a strong bill -- and would hold those trying to weaken the bill publicly accountable.</p>
