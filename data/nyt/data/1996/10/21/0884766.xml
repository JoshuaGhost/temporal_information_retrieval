        <p>A Mysterious World of Women And Their Emotional Landscape</p>
        <p>Vicky Shick and David Alan Harris  St. Mark's Church</p>
        <p>There was nothing smeared about Vicky Shick's new ''Smudges,'' presented by the Danspace Project on Friday night in a program with David Alan Harris. Ms. Shick's choreography and the landscape through which she and her dancers moved were as transparent as they were mysterious and evocative, the dance's simple, layered narrative fragments suggesting James Agee's ''Death in the Family.''</p>
        <p>This was a world of women, signaling restrained but potent emotions through gestures of the arms and head. A pair of fancy boots and a large white paper coat served as focal points in the stage space, with flowing, fleeting encounters for Ms. Shick, Wendy Perron and Juliette Mapp establishing discrete little microcosms throughout that space. Ms. Shick even used a back doorway to poetic effect.</p>
        <p>There were moments when ''Smudges,'' danced to a collage of well-chosen opera, country and dance music, teetered on the edge of preciousness. But everything worked here, from Charles Hagen's projected photographs of women's heads to Barbara Kilpatrick's set and costumes. Carol Mullins's lighting was as unobtrusively daring, perfectly timed and exquisitely beautiful as the dance itself.</p>
        <p>The pairing of Mr. Harris with Ms. Shick did him a cruel disservice. There were many similarities between the artless ''Smudges'' and Mr. Harris's thunderingly artful ''Into Her Own,'' a new two-part dance set to music by Michael Nyman and William Catanzaro. Most unfortunate was a similar expressive use of the arms and hands that in Mr. Harris's piece looked limited, as if the choreographer had taken too few recent dance classes to be able to give himself and his eight performers anything more demanding.</p>
