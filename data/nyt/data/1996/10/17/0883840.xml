        <p>Retailers throughout New York City say that New York Yankees appearance in World Series could bring in more than $22 million for New York City's economy (M)</p>

        <p>Three days after the Yankees won the American League pennant, Mitchell &amp; Ness had shipped its entire stock of expensive, authentically styled shirts and jackets to the four New York-area Yankee Clubhouse stores.</p>
        <p>''They ordered $60,000 in merchandise,'' said Peter Capolino, president of the Philadelphia maker of nostalgic baseball clothing. ''That's a huge surge.''</p>
        <p>Yankee goods -- from a 1903-style Highlanders shirt to a 1961 jacket -- comprise half of Capolino's business, followed by the Dodgers, which make up 25 percent.</p>
        <p>''I lit candles every night for a Yankee-Dodgers World Series,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Apparel sales are always an economic barometer of success for title-winning teams, especially if they have a national following and also because T-shirts and caps are available so rapidly. The 43 local Modell's stores began selling the Yankees' American League championship goods Monday and anticipate brisk sales through Christmas -- if they win the World Series. ''Dramatically less if they lose,'' said Peter Lindenbaum, the vice president of merchandising.</p>
        <p>The team's 34th World Series will also spur at least two more capacity crowds at Yankee Stadium, more money in hot dog vendors' and parking lot operators' pockets, more subway fares paid and more business for local taverns and souvenir shops along and near River Avenue. ''It's their Christmas season,'' said Clint Roswell, a spokesman for Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer.</p>
        <p>The excitement will undoubtedly spur continued consternation over the team's future in the Bronx, and whether the Yankees will move to Manhattan or New Jersey.</p>
        <p>But as a magnet for major local economic activity, the World Series is not the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>Unlike the Super Bowl, the fall classic is a four-of-seven-game affair played in two cities, not a single event played at a single predetermined warm weather or domed site. It lacks the huge buildup that often results in a crescendo of visitor spending at local hotels and restaurants.</p>
        <p>The New York City Comptroller's office estimates that the direct economic impact of the World Series -- from gate, concession, media, lodging and restaurant revenues -- will range from $11.4 million for two games at Yankee Stadium to $22.9 million for four games, following some $14.3 million for the playoffs.</p>
        <p>(The figures exclude the city's overtime costs for the police and sanitation, taxes paid by the Yankees and Stadium maintenance costs.)</p>
        <p>The Super Bowl in January at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans is expected to generate a direct economic gain of $124.7 million, according to the MetroVision Economic Development Partnership Foundation.</p>
        <p>The World Series estimate doesn't equal the economic impact forecast for other local events, such as the Grammy Awards, the World Cup soccer tournament, the Gay Games, the New York City Marathon and the United States Open tennis championships. All those were scheduled well in advance.</p>
        <p>But even if it's not a huge economic engine, ''in terms of visibility and promotion, the World Series is great for New York,'' said Jeanine Moss, a spokeswoman for the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau.</p>
        <p>For Major League Baseball, in its first full season since the 1994 players' strike, having the Yankees in the World Series is a dream come true.</p>
        <p>The New York market virtually guarantees high viewership. New York is the largest market to play in the World Series since 1988, when the Dodgers, from the No. 2 television market, beat Oakland in five games and got a 23.9 rating.</p>
        <p>In 1992 and 1993, the World Series- champion Toronto Blue Jays hailed from a market that is not rated by Nielsen. A Baltimore victory over the Yankees in the American League Championship Series would have put the No. 23 market, with 989,000 TV households, in the World Series as compared with New York's 6.7 million.</p>
        <p>Having a team from the No. 1 market play Atlanta (No. 10) or St. Louis (No. 20) in four to seven telecasts is a boon for the Fox Network, which endured low ratings in the first season of a five-year, $575 million contract. Having the Yankees in the Series can only make it easier for Fox to sell its 30-second spots, which are priced between $250,000 and $300,000.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees attract so much media attention, and it's attention about the team, not about baseball's problems,''said Vince Wladika, a spokesman for Fox Sports. ''Of course, that's a benefit to us.''</p>
        <p>And the New York spotlight can only help baseball. The Yankees are ranked third in licensed merchandise sales, and the business expected to be done if they win the World Series will help accelerate baseball's gradual post-strike revival.</p>
        <p>''When you talk to marketing executives, many of them are in New York, and they really feel the excitement,'' said Brandon Steiner, a Manhattan sports marketer. ''A big market like this accelerates things and pushes baseball to the forefront.''</p>
        <p>Many key marketers from baseball's official sponsors will be among the elite to get seats in Yankee Stadium and the National League ball park.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees are a national team, like the Dallas Cowboys,'' said Marla Miller, group licensing director for Major League Baseball Properties. ''Last year, Cleveland was phenomenal. But the Yankees could be bigger.''</p>
