        <p>The AT&amp;T Corporation announced with great fanfare yesterday that it would begin offering a new type of wireless telephone service in 40 markets across the country, under the brand name Digital PCS. The only problem is that AT&amp;T's service is not exactly new and it is not actually P.C.S.</p>
        <p>P.C.S. -- short for personal communications services -- is a new generation of digital technology that transmits calls at a higher frequency and at lower power than conventional cellular networks. It will enable the industry to sell hand-held phones that are lighter and have clearer sound than today's cellular phones.</p>

        <p>The AT&amp;T Corporation announced with great fanfare yesterday that it would begin offering a new type of wireless telephone service in 40 markets across the country, under the brand name Digital PCS. The only problem is that AT&amp;T's service is not exactly new and it is not actually P.C.S.</p>
        <p>P.C.S. -- short for personal communications services -- is a new generation of digital technology that transmits calls at a higher frequency and at lower power than conventional cellular networks. It will enable the industry to sell hand-held phones that are lighter and have clearer sound than today's cellular phones.</p>
        <p>What AT&amp;T introduced yesterday, as it turns out, is simply a souped-up, digital version of its existing cellular telephone service. And that distinction was not lost on executives at competing P.C.S. companies, several of whom heatedly accused AT&amp;T of misleading consumers.</p>
        <p>''The public will think this is something it's not,'' said George F. Schmitt, president of Omnipoint Communications, a small company that plans to introduce P.C.S. service in New York City by Thanksgiving. ''It's the same old AT&amp;T in a new kimono.''</p>
        <p>Robert E. Allen, chairman and chief executive of AT&amp;T, insisted that digital cellular service and P.C.S. was a distinction without a difference. As such, Mr. Allen argued, AT&amp;T's enhanced new digital cellular service will offer virtually all the features now that P.C.S. will provide later.</p>
        <p>''Consumers really don't care about frequencies; they care about services,'' Mr. Allen said at an elaborate news conference at AT&amp;T's onetime headquarters building in lower Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Industry experts generally agreed with Mr. Allen. They portrayed AT&amp;T's strategy as a shrewd effort to pre-empt the P.C.S. companies, many of which plan to begin offering a genuine P.C.S. service months before AT&amp;T. Mr. Allen said that AT&amp;T, which spent $1.6 billion last year in a Federal auction for true P.C.S. licenses, would not complete its nationwide network until the end of 1997.</p>
        <p>''Customers want cheap, clear talk,'' said Mark Bruneau, president of Coba, a telecommunications consulting firm in Boston, ''If AT&amp;T can do that in a way that pre-empts true P.C.S., good for them.''</p>
        <p>Among the features AT&amp;T Digital PCS will offer are caller ID, voice mail and electronic mail. Those features will also be the centerpiece of AT&amp;T's genuine P.C.S. service next year.</p>
        <p>Until now, most cellular telephone customers -- whether of AT&amp;T or its competitors -- have used only analog cellular phones, which transmit information in radio waves that are analogous to sound waves. AT&amp;T is now trying to speed up the adoption of digital cellular technology, which transmits in the precise signals of computer code.</p>
        <p>By converting its existing cellular customers from analog to digital technology, AT&amp;T could immediately offer advanced new services to a potential market of 70 million people in 40 cities including New York, Miami, Seattle, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and Sacramento.</p>
        <p>The monthly cost of AT&amp;T's Digital PCS service starts at $24.99, plus 60 cents a minute for calls made outside a customer's calling area. The monthly rate is comparable to those for analog cellular calls, although the per-minute rate is significantly lower.</p>
        <p>Customers buy the digital, hand-held telephones separately; they range in price from $150 to $250, according to AT&amp;T executives. Prices of analog phones range from $49 to several hundred dollars.</p>
        <p>Executives at P.C.S. companies contend that the differences between digital cellular and what they offer are more pronounced than AT&amp;T is acknowledging.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Schmitt said that AT&amp;T's new phones use the same voice-coding devices that AT&amp;T has used in earlier versions of its digital service -- which he said meant that the sound quality of the new service could be no better technically. He also said that unlike a P.C.S. network, which will use digital transmission from end to end, AT&amp;T could not transmit data in purely digital form, except for brief E-mail messages. That means that P.C.S. will be able to offer higher-speed data services than cellular technology, Mr. Schmitt contended.</p>
        <p>Executives at AT&amp;T acknowledged that the voice quality of P.C.S. is superior to their new service. But they said their digital network could transmit data just as fast.</p>
        <p>Besides, AT&amp;T said, by the time the company completes its P.C.S. network in 1997, it will have all the advantages of P.C.S. and cover a potential market of 212 million.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T's rivals said the company's announcement yesterday represented an attempt to compensate for slackness in building its own P.C.S. network.</p>
        <p>''We haven't seen them anywhere,'' said Tim Klein, a spokesman for BellSouth, which began offering P.C.S. service in July in Tennessee and the Carolinas.</p>
        <p>But analysts noted that several of AT&amp;T's rivals lack its powerful presence in the cellular business, which it acquired through the 1993 purchase of McCaw Cellular Communications. So they have no choice but to rush their P.C.S. networks into service as quickly as possible, in hope of eroding AT&amp;T's cellular customer base.</p>
        <p>One of those companies, SprintPCS, plans to offer service in 15 to 20 markets, including New York City, by the end of the year. It will add 33 more markets in 1997, to reach a potential 190 million people, according to Andrew Sukawaty, the chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sukawaty acknowledged that AT&amp;T's new service would pose a marketing challenge to P.C.S. providers. But he added, ''Consumer aren't stupid; they can tell the difference between cellular and P.C.S.''</p>
        <p>While critics may accuse AT&amp;T of legerdemain, few denied that its announcement yesterday was a public relations bonanza for a company that in recent weeks has been reeling from high-level management defections and an erosion in its core, long-distance phone business.</p>
        <p>Even Mr. Allen, the laconic AT&amp;T chairman, happily chatted away on his own Digital PCS phone in a call arranged for the news media to witness. On the other end: Lillian Mitchell, a 14-year-old junior high school student from Pittsburgh.</p>
