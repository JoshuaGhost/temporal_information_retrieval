        <p>In another chapter in the case of a 13-year-old boy abducted by his father 12 years ago and reunited with his mother last week, the authorities disclosed yesterday that the boy, Leonard Joseph Cammalleri, had been placed with a foster family in New York City.</p>
        <p>A government official, who insisted on anonymity, said that at a meeting between the child and the mother, the mother had became disconcerted and said she was not prepared to take the child.</p>
        <p>The official stressed that the separation was probably not permanent and that at some point the two would likely be reunited. The mother needs time to deal with emotional issues, the official said.</p>
        <p>The mother's lawyer, David Wallman, would neither confirm nor deny that the boy was in foster care. He said the mother, identified only as Sally, was dealing with the ramifications of being with a child who was basically a stranger.</p>
        <p>''She has to reassert a relationship with a child she has not seen in 12 years,'' he said. ''The boy has been raised being told that the mother and the police might at any minute break down the door -- that they were wanted.'' But he emphasized that the ''mother has sole custody and was asserting her custody rights.''</p>
        <p>Last week, the boy's father, Leonard Alfred Cammalleri, was arrested by agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and investigators for the Westchester County District Attorney's office in the Bronx apartment where the two had been living.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cammalleri faces custodial interference charges in Connecticut, where he is accused of abducting the boy. He had faced Federal kidnapping charges, but they were dropped so that the state could proceed with its case.</p>
        <p>Federal agents flew the boy's mother in from the Middle West for the reunion. At a news briefing last week, the Westchester District Attorney, Jeanine Pirro, said her office had acted on a tip that led to the arrest of Mr. Cammalleri. Ms. Pirro said the mother was ecstatic to see her son for the first time since he was in diapers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro would not return calls today. Asked to comment on the latest developments in the case, Francis T. Donohue, the chief assistant district attorney in her office, said, ''The State's Attorney in Connecticut is handling the case, and as such we will have no further comment.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Cammalleri, Susanne Brody, expressed outrage that the boy had been placed in foster care while the ''father who devoted his life to raising his son'' sits in a Bridgeport jail cell on $100,000 bond.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brody said Mr. Cammalleri believed his former wife to be an unfit mother, who may have had another child in a previous marriage that was removed from her by the state. But Mr. Wallman said his client had no other children.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cammalleri did not allow the boy to go to school or to have playmates. Ms. Brody said that the child was taught at home and that Mr. Cammalleri was ''with him when he learned to talk, he taught him multiplication and reading, and took him to the park.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''Lenny understands about the immaturity of a child who is allowed no peer play and no schooling, but the fear of losing his child was his raison d'etre.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cammalleri plans to fight for custody, Ms. Brody said, adding that her husband, Gary Cohen, a matrimonial lawyer in Greenwich, Conn., would be taking Mr. Cammalleri's case at no charge.</p>
        <p>''Let's see the system put the family back together,'' she said. ''How can they put him in foster care when Lenny was never notified of a hearing? The perfect ending to this saga is to have Lenny and Lenny Jr. at a Yankees playoff game. Let's bring the boys back to the Bronx.''</p>
        <p>She said that Mr. Cammalleri's mother and sister, who lived in the Bronx, would be ''thrilled to take this kid'' temporarily while the custody issue was resolved, adding, ''Why is he in foster care?''</p>
        <p>There has been acrimony between Sally and Mr. Cammalleri's relatives. Ms. Brody said Sally won a $750,000 judgment in a civil suit against Mr. Cammalleri's sister a few years ago because she believed the sister knew Mr. Cammalleri's whereabouts. But she had been unable to collect on the judgment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallman said that Sally wanted no one to know her location nor the location of the boy now because she feared that Mr. Cammalleri, if he made bail, would try to abduct him again.</p>
