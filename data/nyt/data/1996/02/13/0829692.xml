        <p>Men's fashion is on the kind of creative roll that used to be the norm for women's clothing design.</p>
        <p>While women's fashion in the last two years has been incapable of getting the momentum for anything resembling a movement, men's fashion is in the creative throes of one. Women's fashion most recently suggested that women of all ages dress like moms; yet, men's fashion is throwing off Daddy's clothes -- stern suits with corporate pretentions -- and even soft, asexual Italian ones. T'e roots, instead, are in rock rebellion dressing, a look nearing 50 and therefore  considered almost establishment: a silhouette both sexy and forgiving, with deep moody colors and a lean lithe shape.</p>

        <p>Men's fashion is on the kind of creative roll that used to be the norm for women's clothing design.</p>
        <p>While women's fashion in the last two years has been incapable of getting the momentum for anything resembling a movement, men's fashion is in the creative throes of one. Women's fashion most recently suggested that women of all ages dress like moms; yet, men's fashion is throwing off Daddy's clothes -- stern suits with corporate pretentions -- and even soft, asexual Italian ones. T'e roots, instead, are in rock rebellion dressing, a look nearing 50 and therefore  considered almost establishment: a silhouette both sexy and forgiving, with deep moody colors and a lean lithe shape.</p>
        <p>Certainly the Council of Fashion Designers of America, with its awards last  night, suggested that men's fashion is entering a golden era. Tom Ford, for Gucci, and Richard Tyler , both winners, are in the forefront of that new era, along with Helmut Lang and Costume Homme, bringing men's fashion the edge and body-consciousness once available only to women.</p>
        <p>What was most surprising at the American men's wear shows that ended last Thursday was to find the greatest traditionalist of them all, Ralph Lauren (who  won an award for women's fashion last night), in that same camp, with sexy, sharp clothes that have more to do with clean Le Courbusier architecture than with English tweeds. And to find Calvin Klein committing his most expensive new  line, Black on Black, to the tapered silhouette.</p>
        <p>"There's a whole group all on the same wavelength, which is really reassuring," Mr. Tyler said after his triumphant show, full of masterly tailoring, masculine references and innovative design.</p>
        <p>The feel-good fashion promises that have always been made to women are now there for men (when women seem to reject the notion): look younger, fitter, sexier, sharper. The structure of the suits makes middle-aged bodies look toned, even when they aren't, something slumpy suits can't do.</p>
        <p>Inspired by how far men have to go, and by how much room there is in their closets, designers are spending considerable creative energy on the male customer. Young designers like John Bartlett, Austyn Zung, Gene Meyer and, for Richard Edwards, Richard Bengtsson and Edward Pavlick are focused only on men's  fashion, and all showed inspired creative efforts.</p>
        <p>And clearly, Mr. Tyler, Mr. Lauren and Mr. Klein have put tremendous thought  and energy into collections as fluid and full of ideas as their best women's shows.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyler was inspired equally by Johnny Cash and the Warren Beatty of "Shampoo," with the swagger on his runway coming from jackets fitted with three  seams up the back and trousers tapered into a slight flare over clean roper-style cowboy boots. Longer jackets had flapping vents in the back, and stiff Wrangler-style denim was cut as carefully as if it were cashmere. Even button-down collars were given a sexy edge, open and peeking out of the top of jackets or worn with tone-on-tone ties. And leather and pony-skin jackets were sexy and luxurious, in deep burgundy or gunmetal.</p>
        <p>The dark and dangerous mood that drove this show turned brooding at Ralph Lauren, where the new silhouette is so pared down that buttons are hidden or spare, as in an innovative double-breasted jacket with one button at the hip. The feel, like the color, is black. Even his high-end purple label had a less corporate, more Heathcliff-worthy look, with a hacking-jacket suit with cuffs at the sleeve, strong shoulders and lean lines. The muse may be Gary Cooper, but the elegance with an architectura' cleanness is a sort of fashion "Fountainhead."</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein's show was an ode to the uniform, from CK's Boy Scout-inspired looks (coming from the real Boy Scout shirts and ties that club kids have been wearing) to a huge range of the grown man's uniform: the suit. With deep chocolate browns, fresh-ground coffees and the color when black is burned, Mr. Klein's best suits were beautiful in his new black-label category, fitted deftly to the shoulder and tapered at the waist.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bartlett's daring show was a paean to After Dark, the not-quite-out 1970's magazine full of the sort of hulking, lamb-chop-sideburn men who inspired the artist Tom of Finland. On a fake-fur-covered runway with a triptych of a pinup as a backdrop, the designer offered a ribald tribute to the only look of the era that hasn't been mined: beefy men bursting from leisure suits, tight trousers flared and buttoned at the bottom, furs, cropped bolero shirts and sculptured knits. Without the runway exaggeration, the cut is similar to Mr. Tyler's, and like any great designer, Mr. Bartlett makes the look of the moment  a personal statement.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it was a season when many young designers entered the big leagues. Mr. Edwards, given an award last night as best newcomer in men's fashion, has laid claim to the cleanest 1950's American sportswear but has given it a European twist: zip-front short jackets in harmonic plaids, flap-front tapered trousers, color-blocked sweaters.</p>
        <p>Ms. Zung took a big step forward this season, perfecting her nipped-side buckling silhouette and showing great graphic-color-blocked sweaters with lean carmel-color leather trousers. Gene Meyer has added suits to his line, but what  is still most endearing is his witty use of spirited graphics and colors on silk shirts and sweaters, and even a glossy ski jacket.</p>
        <p>Young designers at the showcase sponsored by the council were ambitious, particularly Ufuk Omer Arkun, with cool basics, and Klurk by Brian Chik, with offbeat, off-color, on-target clothes.</p>
        <p>The commercial powerhouses this season worked hard to prove their fashion mettle. Nautica by David Chu offered a persuasive mix of tailored clothes with techno ones, the look driving a new era of sports-meets-suits. And Wolfgang Joop abandoned the silly styling tricks of the past to show off a credible collection of easy-to-understand tailored clothing, great leather jackets, even shimmery disco inferno suits.</p>
        <p>Since Tommy Hilfiger paid a fun tribute on his runway to rock dressing through the ages, a line from Bob Seger's "Night Moves" comes to mind: "I used her, she used me but neither one cared. We were getting our share."</p>
        <p>It seems obvious what Mr. Hilfiger gets from the association of a superstar like Coolio walking his runway: more credibility with the black urban customer who has made him a star (and who holds more cards to his future than Mr. Hilfiger may like).</p>
        <p>Yet, wanting to be true to his preppy roots, Mr. Hilfiger, who won an award last night for best men's wear design, also had an impressive collection of pastel tweeds, in golfer colors. And for his own earnest rocker aspirations, he  had plenty of glitter-glamour rock-wannabe stuff, with a cool English cut on jackets.</p>
        <p>If affections for Carhardt and Nike can be an indication, it is the utilitarian brand appeal of Mr. Hilfiger's label, not its designer status, that  has drawn rappers. As he emerges from behind the brand with all the magazine profiles money can buy, the question is: Will the street customer who has made his label cool stay loyal.</p>
        <p>The Hilfiger label does have a certain cool now, thanks to Coolio and company. Put aside the garish glitter-rock clothes, and the sturdy workwear and  hip extreme sports clothes look like what DKNY wants to be.</p>
        <p>And what DKNY and Donna Karan want to be for men is the question of the season. Ms. Karan 'as often said that her husband, an artist, is the muse for the line. But the main collection felt less artistic than just plain droopy. Only the rich leathers felt true to the Manhattan soul of Ms. Karan's work. It seems a good time for her to re-examine where men's fashion is going, as she has continually re-examined her women's line.</p>
