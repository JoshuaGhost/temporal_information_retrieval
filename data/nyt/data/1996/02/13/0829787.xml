        <p>Finding Connections Between the Unconnected Edward Aldwell, Pianist Weill Recital Hall</p>
        <p>Edward Aldwell is best known for his expert and original Bach playing, but he devoted his Thursday evening recital to two other composers who interest him, Schubert and Hindemith. Both might seem, at a glance, to inhabit worlds far from Bach's. But Hindemith's "Ludus Tonalis," though it speaks a 20th-century language, has obvious structural roots in "The Well-Tempered Clavier." And although Mr. Aldwell had to work harder to find common ground between Bach and Schubert, his carefully etched readings of the Impromptus (D.935) suggested that there are connections po be made.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aldwell took a classicist's view of Schubert. Using the pedal sparingly  and producing coloration that was dry but by no means monochromatic, he seemed intent on approximating the sound of a Schubert-era piano. In the first and fourth Impromptus, that approach made for crisply articulated lines and transparent textures. Counterpoint, more typically a subsidiary concern, was illuminated. And Schubert's form of persuasion was shown to be aggressive rather than seductive.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Aldwell was not straitjacketed by his conception. In the second  and third Impromptus, edges were not as sharp as in the outer works and chordal  blocks rang out without restraint.</p>
        <p>The Hindemith, a series of 12 Fugues and Interludes, framed by a palindromic  Prelude and Postlude, is a comprehensive tour of the piano. There is great rhythmic ingenuity in the fugue subjects, which range from the neo-Bachian to the Impressionistic. And the more freely constructed Interludes demand virtually every gradation of pianism, from lyricism to spiky extroversion. Mr. Aldwell's resilient reading made at least one listener regret the rarity with which the work is performed.</p>
