        <p>The elimination of remedial courses at colleges and universities by states facing budget constraints could block many poor and minority students from obtaining advanced training, a report by a higher education group reported today.</p>
        <p>About 13 percent of undergraduates, or about 1.6 million students, took at least one remedial course in the 1992-93 school year, according to the report released today by the American Council on Education. The report said these students often came from lower-income families, were born outside the United States and did not speak English at home.</p>

        <p>The elimination of remedial courses at colleges and universities by states facing budget constraints could block many poor and minority students from obtaining advanced training, a report by a higher education group reported today.</p>
        <p>About 13 percent of undergraduates, or about 1.6 million students, took at least one remedial course in the 1992-93 school year, according to the report released today by the American Council on Education. The report said these students often came from lower-income families, were born outside the United States and did not speak English at home.</p>
        <p>If you eliminate these courses, you are going to cut off their access to college," said David Merkowitz, a spokesman for the council.</p>
        <p>Nineteen percent of black, Hispanic and Asian-American undergraduates and 15  percent of American Indian students took remedial courses in the 1992-93 school  year, compared with 11 percent of white undergraduates, the report said.</p>
        <p>Even though most institutions plan to continue offering remedial classes, educators in some states having difficulty balancing their budgets want to offer catch-up classes only at junior colleges, cut the number of remedial course offerings or limit them to first-year students.</p>
        <p>Some states are tightening college admission requirements to lessen the need  for remedial lessons, the report said. Others want high schools to pay for the remedial work for their graduates.</p>
        <p>The City University of New York, tightened admissions requirements last year. Applicants judged unable to complete remedial courses within one year will be denied admission to four-year colleges and sent to community colleges, beginning this fall. The change will affect about 2,500 of the system's 213,000 students.</p>
        <p>At Florida community colleges, nearly 70 percent of first-time students needed at least one remedial reading, writing or math class in the 1993-94 school year, said Linda Bradley-Long, a spokeswoman for the Florida House of Representatives' Committee on Higher Education. The courses cost the community colleges $53 million a year, she said.</p>
        <p>Transferring the costs to high schools was discussed, but discarded, last year by Florida lawmakers. They decided instead to study ways to strengthen academic requirements in lower grades, she said.</p>
