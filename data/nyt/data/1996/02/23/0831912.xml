        <p>Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today appointed a Canadian judge with a background in civil rights and criminal law to replace Richard Goldstone  of South Africa as head of the international criminal tribunals on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.</p>
        <p>The new judge, Louise Arbour, of the Ontario Court of Appeal, is to take office in October, subject to Security Council approval.</p>
        <p>Justice Goldstone, who plans to return to South Africa's high court, had been expected to step down this summer. But diplomats said Justice Goldstone had been persuaded to stay on until the fall, and his decision was widely welcomed.  He has been on a leave of absence, as are most of the judges on the two panels.</p>
        <p>The imminent departure of Justice Goldstone had been a cause for concern because the tribunals have only recently begun to function, and against great odds. The tribunals rely on voluntary contributions from United Nations members, and they are short of funds and operate with very small staffs.</p>
        <p>The Yugoslav tribunal, based in the Hague, has indicted dozens of Serbs and some Croats and Muslims suspected of having committed abuses during more than three years of civil war. Only a handful are in custody, however, and arresting  others has been difficult. In Bosnia, NATO forces have wavered over their responsibility to detain those being sought.</p>
        <p>The Rwanda tribunal, based in Arusha, Tanzania, has also issued indictments but has faced immense problems in trying to have alleged criminals detained and extradited from neighboring African states.</p>
        <p>After genocidal attacks on Rwandan Tutsi by Hutu militias in 1994, more than  a million Hutu fled to Zaire, Burundi and other nearby nations where they continue to threaten peace in Rwanda. Rwandan officials say it is urgent that justice be seen to be done so cycles of retribution can be broken.</p>
        <p>Justice Goldstone was regarded as a figure who brought great prestige and influence to his position, and there have been fears that the tribunals could be weakened by his departure. The appointment of Justice Arbour was greeted with approval by American and other diplomats.</p>
        <p>Justice Arbour, 49, was a vice president of the Canadian Civil Liberties Union before her appointment to the bench in 1995.</p>
        <p>An expert in criminal law, she has taught criminal procedure and civil law at York University in Canada and has written extensively on human rights, civil liberties and gender issues.</p>
        <p>In both Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, rape and other forms of sexual assault were widespread, and international women's groups have been eager to see that these crimes are treated on a par with other war crimes.</p>
        <p>Justice Arbour is currently on leave from the Ontario Court of Appeal to conduct an inquiry into problems at the Prison for Women in Kingston, Ontario.</p>
