        <p>A Federal judge in Manhattan refused yesterday to grant the Dallas Cowboys' motion to dismiss NFL Properties' $300 million suit against them charging that the team's deals for Nike, Pepsi-Cola and American Express to sponsor Texas Stadium violate the National Football League licensing and sponsorship policies.</p>
        <p>Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that the deals made by the Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, may have breached the league trust that lets NFL Properties market  team names and logos and that it may be an impermissible use of the Cowboys' trademark. Scheindlin dismissed two lesser counts, letting stand seven league claims.</p>

        <p>A Federal judge in Manhattan refused yesterday to grant the Dallas Cowboys' motion to dismiss NFL Properties' $300 million suit against them charging that the team's deals for Nike, Pepsi-Cola and American Express to sponsor Texas Stadium violate the National Football League licensing and sponsorship policies.</p>
        <p>Judge Shira A. Scheindlin ruled that the deals made by the Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, may have breached the league trust that lets NFL Properties market  team names and logos and that it may be an impermissible use of the Cowboys' trademark. Scheindlin dismissed two lesser counts, letting stand seven league claims.</p>
        <p>She let stand, for example, the league allegation that Texas Stadium "entered into these contracts as a 'stand-in' for the Cowboys' partnership," and the use of team logos "would violate" league agreements. The team expected her ruling. The case will now move to discovery. In response to the league's lawsuit, the team countersued for $750 million.</p>
        <p>Since his deal-making started last summer, Jones has pushed for the dismemberment of NFL Properties and for individual teams to market their names,  logos and trademarks.</p>
