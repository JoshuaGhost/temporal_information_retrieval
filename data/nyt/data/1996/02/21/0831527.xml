        <p>Stock and bond markets declined sharply yesterday, continuing a four-day selloff that is leading some investors to question whether a fundamental shift in sentiment might be under way.</p>
        <p>For months, investors have been wagering that slower economic growth would lead to further declines in interest rates. And that belief, traders and analysts said, helped send the stock market to highs and pushed short- and long-term interest rates down sharply.</p>
        <p>But in the last week that faith has been fading. And yesterday, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, raised doubts about additional cuts in short-term interest rates, knocking one of the main supports from beneath this year's stock market boom.</p>
        <p>In a volatile session that saw two rounds of sharp price declines and only one solid rebound, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 44.79 points, or more that eight-tenths of a percent, to 5,458.53. At one point, the index was down nearly 70 points. With yesterday's decline, the Dow has lost 142 points, or 2.5  percent, in the last four sessions. (The stock and bond markets were closed on Monday in observance of Washington's Birthday.)</p>
        <p>Other market indexes also fell yesterday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index declined 7.33 points, or 1.13 percent, to 640.65, while the Nasdaq composite index slipped 7.47, to 1,083.24.</p>
        <p>Bonds also tumbled, with the price of the 30-year Treasury bond falling more  than 2 points, the largest loss since May 1994. The yield on the long bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to 6.40 percent, up from 6.24 percent on Friday. As recently as Jan. 19, the yield on the long-term  bond was less than 6 percent, and the selloff has wiped out all the gains made at the end of last year. [Page D17.]</p>
        <p>Analysts are not yet ready to declare this year's market rallies over, especially in stocks, where the Dow is still up 6.7 percent despite the current  selloff. But the recent declines are making them wonder if investors have given  up hope for further cuts in interest rates and are beginning to worry more about inflation, despite the fact that inflation has remained at 3 percent for four years.</p>
        <p>"Based on what Alan Greenspan said, there are valid questions about the timing and degree of further cuts in interest rates," said A. Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney.</p>
        <p>Byron R. Wien, director of United States portfolio strategy at Morgan Stanley, added: "The Administration wants growth even if it includes higher inflation. The focus has shifted from fiscal responsibility to economic growth,  and that's bad for interest rates."</p>
        <p>Election-year talk about getting the economy to grow faster, especially the new emphasis among leading Republican Presidential candidates like the Senate majority leader, Bob Dole, is what is making some investors worry about inflation. To the bond market, growth raises the possibility of inflation, giving bond traders yet another reason to be cautious. And rising interest rates can worry the stock market.</p>
        <p>The Republican candidates have all but dropped their previously fervent calls for balancing the Federal budget, focusing instead on reasons why the United States economy needs to continue to grow.</p>
        <p>President Clinton yesterday sounded his own call for continued economic expansion, saying he wanted to appoint someone to the Fed's board of governors who holds pro-growth views on the economy and does not just represent the "conventional wisdom."</p>
        <p>Mr. Wein of Morgan Stanley asked: "How long has it been since you've heard somebody get up and scream about a balanced budget? That kind of talk smacks of  cutbacks and sacrifice, and that doesn't attract voters."</p>
        <p>Already, bond markets around the globe have started to suffer higher interest rates, said E. Wayne Nordberg, a partner at Lord, Abbett &amp; Company, a New York money management firm. In recent weeks, traders who borrowed money at very low rates in Japan to invest in bonds paying higher rates in Germany, for example, have begun to unwind those positions, he said.</p>
        <p>In addition, the inclination of central bankers across Europe to act together "is beginning to weaken," Mr. Nordberg said. "Therefore, European central banks  might pursue more inflationary monetary policies." In such an environment, "for  more speculative traders to turn around and take profits is not unusual," he said.</p>
        <p>That is starting to spell trouble for foreign stock markets. Among other active markets yesterday, the Mexican Bolsa index fell 71.03 points, or 2.4 percent, to 2,904.41, and the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index declined 62.57, or 1.2 percent, to 4,963.80. In Britain, the FT-SE 100 index lost 29.70, to 3,714.60, and in Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index dipped 65.58, to 20,655.67.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nordberg added that he expected to continue to see greater volatility in  the American stock market leading up to the fall election.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the sharp decline in the big American stock indexes yesterday, stocks recording losses on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered those with gains nearly 4 to 1. Volume was 395.9 million shares, down from 445.6 million on Friday.</p>
        <p>Volume was relatively light throughout the day, giving at least one trader pause about whether the decline in prices represented the beginning of a larger  decline in stock prices. "I would expect more volume if institutions really were selling heavily," said Jack Baker, head of institutional equity trading at Furman Selz.</p>
        <p>After stock prices declined sharply at the opening bell, falling more than 50 points in the first half hour, they quickly rebounded and stayed relatively steady, at about 5,470, until 2:30 P.M., when Mr. Greenspan began his testimony  before Congress.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Greenspan said was not as important as the way in which many investors and traders chose to interpret his remarks. The Fed chairman said that the seeds are in place for moderate, sustainable growth. While a positive remark for those worried that economy may be slowing too much, stock and bond traders decided that Mr. Greenspan's comments cast considerable doubt on whether the Fed would make further cuts in short-term interest rates in the near future.</p>
        <p>Not all large stocks were losers yesterday. I.B.M., for example, traded as high as 120 7/8 before closing 1 1/8 higher, at 119 1/8, its highest price since March 1991. The company yesterday introduced new products and services that will allow its existing mainframe computers to serve as Internet servers, perhaps breathing new life into the large boxes that many computer experts consider to be dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>Among other active stocks, Sierra On-Line gained 7 3/8, to 34 1/2, after agreeing to be acquired by CUC International, which fell 6 1/4, to 31 1/4.</p>
        <p>In addition to I.B.M., several other technology stocks also posted gains. Cisco Systems rose 1 1/8, to 45 5/8; Micron Technology moved up 3/4, to 36 7/8;  Motorola jumped 7/8, to 56 1/8, and Apple Computer, whose new chairman outlined  his priorities to the media on Friday, rose 1 1/2, to 29..</p>
        <p>Bank stocks fell sharply on the outlook for higher interest rates. J. P. Morgan fell 1 7/8, to 79 3/8; Bankers Trust New York dipped 2 1/8, to 63; Citicorp fell 1 1/2, to 73 7/8, and Chase Manhattan, finished down 1 1/2, at 68  1/2.</p>
        <p>Utility stocks, which also typically feel the effects of sharp moves in interest rates, declined. The Dow Jones utilities average, a closely watched industry barometer, fell 3.99 points, or 1.7 percent, to 225.75.</p>
