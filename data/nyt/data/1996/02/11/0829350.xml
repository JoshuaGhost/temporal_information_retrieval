        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan today appealed to anti-abortion advocates and other social conservatives to unite behind his campaign, arguing that he is the only anti-abortion candidate who can defeat Senator Bob Dole and Steve Forbes, whom he called insufficiently committed to ending abortion.</p>
        <p>"I'm the only pro-lifer who can win," Mr. Buchanan told a crowd at the Knights of Columbus Hall here in this northwest Iowa farming town, largely made  up German and Irish Catholics. "If we split our votes we're going to lose it all. We could lose it to Steve Forbes. And there it all goes; everything we fought for, everything we've worked for."</p>

        <p>Patrick J. Buchanan today appealed to anti-abortion advocates and other social conservatives to unite behind his campaign, arguing that he is the only anti-abortion candidate who can defeat Senator Bob Dole and Steve Forbes, whom he called insufficiently committed to ending abortion.</p>
        <p>"I'm the only pro-lifer who can win," Mr. Buchanan told a crowd at the Knights of Columbus Hall here in this northwest Iowa farming town, largely made  up German and Irish Catholics. "If we split our votes we're going to lose it all. We could lose it to Steve Forbes. And there it all goes; everything we fought for, everything we've worked for."</p>
        <p>As he has done increasingly of late, Mr. Buchanan called Mr. Forbes a "social liberal" who "believes in the right to abortion right up to the 24th week of pregnancy." And Mr. Buchanan asserted that Mr. Dole had "waffled" on abortion and is not committed to appointing a Supreme Court justice who will overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1972 Supreme Court ruling that led to legalized abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan's appeal came on a day when the Des Moines Register published a  poll showing Mr. Buchanan in third place at 11 percent, but within striking distance of Mr. Forbes, who is favored by 16 percent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buchanan said he believed that Mr. Dole would win the Iowa caucuses on Monday, but said that "there's a battle on for who's going to become the challenger to Bob Dole." Citing his recent victories in an Alaskan straw poll and the Louisiana caucuses, Mr. Buchanan urged supporters of other strongly anti-abortion candidates like Senator Phil Gramm and Alan Keyes, the radio commentator, to switch to him.</p>
        <p>"There's one pro-life candidate in this race who can win, and one conservative candidate who can win," Mr. Buchanan said. "That's why I'm asking folks who supported Senator Gramm, who's a conservative on a lot of issues, and  who supported Alan Keyes, who is articulate and done a wonderful job in elevating the life issue, come with me before the Iowa caucuses."</p>
