        <p>SEA SCALLOPS pair beautifully with the flavors of cooked endive, radicchio and fennel. They are especially good glazed with orange juice and balsamic vinegar and served with braised fennel, which has a delicate anise flavor. I also like to serve them on a bed of slivered sauteed endives, sprinkled with lemon juice, or with grilled radicchio, which like endive loses its bitterness when cooked.</p>
        <p>As scallops yield a great deal of juice in the pan (often because they have been plumped up with water), remove them, let the juices evaporate over high heat and return them to the pan to finish cooking.</p>

        <p>SEA SCALLOPS pair beautifully with the flavors of cooked endive, radicchio and fennel. They are especially good glazed with orange juice and balsamic vinegar and served with braised fennel, which has a delicate anise flavor. I also like to serve them on a bed of slivered sauteed endives, sprinkled with lemon juice, or with grilled radicchio, which like endive loses its bitterness when cooked.</p>
        <p>As scallops yield a great deal of juice in the pan (often because they have been plumped up with water), remove them, let the juices evaporate over high heat and return them to the pan to finish cooking.</p>
        <p>A dry white wine like Chablis, Sancerre, Muscadet or sauvignon blanc goes well with these dishes.</p>
        <p>Glazed Sea Scallops With Braised Fennel</p>
        <p>Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2 heads fennel 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 2 shallots, chopped 1 clove garlic, minced 1 1/2 pounds sea scallops Juice of 1 orange (about 1/2 cup) 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried).</p>
        <p>1. Cut the fennel into quarters and steam it until it is just tender (about 15 minutes).</p>
        <p>2. Heat two tablespoons of the olive oil in a heavy skillet and add the fennel. Sprinkle it with salt and pepper and cook it, stirring occasionally, until it is slightly browned on all sides.</p>
        <p>3. Soften the shallots and the garlic in the remaining olive oil in a large,  heavy skillet. Saute the scallops in two batches over high heat, browning them lightly on both sides. Remove them to a warm bowl.</p>
        <p>4. Add the orange juice, balsamic vinegar and rosemary leaves. Scrape up the  cooking juices and simmer them until you have a light glaze. Pour the sauce over the scallops and toss them. Correct seasoning and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Endive With Lemon And Sauteed Scallops</p>
        <p>Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>6 heads endive 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil Juice of 1 lemon Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 16 sea scallops 2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley, chopped.</p>
        <p>1. Cut the endives in half, remove their tough inner cores and slice the endive  leaves into slivers.</p>
        <p>2. Melt the butter and two tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and cook the endive over medium heat until tender and the liquid has evaporated (about eight  minutes). Remove the pan from the heat, stir in two tablespoons lemon juice and  season with salt and pepper. Keep warm.</p>
        <p>3. Season the scallops with salt and pepper. Heat the remaining olive oil in  a large skillet and saute the scallops in two batches over high heat until they  are lightly browned on both sides.</p>
        <p>4. Divide the endive among four plates. Put the scallops on top, sprinkle them with lemon juice and parsley and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This is based on a recipe by the French chef Georges Blanc.</p>
        <p>Grilled Sea Scallops With Radicchio</p>
        <p>Total time: 2 hours marinating, 20 minutes hands on</p>
        <p>16 large sea scallops 1 teaspoon fresh thyme (or 1/2 teaspoon dried) 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 2 heads radicchio Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste 1 lemon, cut into quarters 4 sprigs fresh thyme if available.</p>
        <p>1. Put the scallops in a bowl, sprinkle them with the thyme and two tablespoons of the olive oil and toss them. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for two hours before cooking. Remove from the refrigerator 10 minutes before cooking the scallops.</p>
        <p>2. Preheat broiler or grill. Cut each head of radicchio into four pieces. Sprinkle radicchio with the remaining olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Grill the radicchio until it is wilted and lightly browned, turning occasionally. Remove to a warm platter.</p>
        <p>3. Grill the scallops until they are browned on both sides. Divide the radicchio among four plates along with the scallops. Garnish each with a lemon quarter and a sprig of thyme.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
