        <p>DESPITE slumping sales, rising bankruptcy filings and consolidations by large store chains that are threatening to create substantial retail vacancies by the  end of the year, developers are moving forward with major retail projects on Long Island.</p>
        <p>These developers say rentals are brisk because national retailers continue to view Long Island as one of the nation's most lucrative markets.</p>
        <p>You have 2.3 million people with extremely strong demographics," said Steven B. Greenberg, president of the Greenberg Group, retail consultants in Hewlett. "There has been very little new development in the last three years, so although the retail business is difficult and we are seeing a host of bankruptcies, things are really not so bad."</p>
        <p>The retail downturn has not affected all areas. With consumers always hungering for something new, home furnishings and electronics stores at Roosevelt Center are doing exceptionally well, said Edward J. Minskoff, a principal of MCS Realty Partners of Manhattan. MCS is developing the 2.6-million-square-foot mixed-use complex on the former Roosevelt Raceway site in Westbury.</p>
        <p>The 600,000 square feet of retail space in the center, where construction started less than a year ago, is almost completed and is fully rented, said Mr.  Minskoff. Retailers include such newcomers to Long Island as Incredible Universe, an electronics store, and the Home Depot Expo Design Center. A Babies  'R' Us store, another newcomer to Long Island, will open in March.</p>
        <p>Nearby on Old Country Road in Westbury, two-thirds of the 522,000 square feet of new rentable space on a 38-acre site now occupied by Fortunoff has been preleased -- even though it is not yet under construction, said Alan Fortunoff,  Fortunoff's president. He is developing the site as a 930,000-square-foot mall called the Source in a joint venture with the Simon Property Group of Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>"This is a terrific time for the kind of mall we are building because we are  bringing a lot of retailers to Long Island that are not here now," Mr. Fortunoff said.</p>
        <p>The anchor stores at the Source will include a 45,000-square-foot Nordstrom Rack and a 35,000-square-foot Off 5th, Saks Fifth Avenue Outlet, which are outlet stores for the two retailers. Others are Virgin Megastore, a record and video store that will occupy 25,000 square feet, and Just For Feet, a shoe store that has taken 19,000 square feet. Old Navy Clothing Company, a division of Gap; the Cheesecake Factory, a restaurant, and Innovation Luggage are among other retailers who will be in the development.</p>
        <p>Ground was broken for the $145 million complex on Feb. 1. The mall will include the 32-year-old existing 212,000-square-foot Fortunoff store when it is completed in August 1997.</p>
        <p>At the Roosevelt Field Shopping Center in Garden City almost 400,000 square feet of space is being added to the mall's existing 2 million square feet.</p>
        <p>N ORDSTROM, a department store chain based in Seattle, is building a 225,000-square-foot store on the east side of the mall on land it has leased from Corporate Property Investors of Manhattan, the mall owners. The new store,  Nordstrom's first on Long Island, will open in the fall of 1997.</p>
        <p>Corporate Property Investors itself is completing a 168,000-square-foot second-story addition to the the mall. The new space, to be ready for occupancy  this fall, will be divided into 50 stores. About 80 percent of that space has already been leased, said Michael J. Maloney, the company's senior vice president.</p>
        <p>"Retail sales were difficult last year and Roosevelt Field has to reflect what's happening in retailing in general," Mr. Maloney said. "However, with such a huge depository of stores, people may not be spending as much as they did in years past. But they are still spending a tremendous amount."</p>
        <p>Corporate Property Investors also is moving ahead with plans to renovate and  expand its 950,000-square-foot Walt Whitman Mall on Route 110 in Melville and add 330,000 square feet of space. New tenants will include a two-story Saks Fifth Avenue, which will move into 120,000 square feet of new space, and Bloomingdale's, which will occupy 220,000 square feet of the existing mall.</p>
        <p>An additional 210,000 square feet of new construction on a second level will  be divided into 100 smaller stores. About $250 million is being spent on the mall project, including work being done by the individual department stores.</p>
        <p>"Malls are expanding because they look at the long term," said Rick Kreindler, chairman of Island Realty, commercial brokers in Melville.</p>
        <p>"What's coming down the road should be positive and whoever presents space in the most attractive way is going to get the business."</p>
        <p>New locations are also under development. Wilbur J. Breslin, a Garden City developer, said he expected to start construction of the 790,000-square-foot first phase of a 1.6 million square-foot mall in Yaphank this spring.</p>
        <p>He is also at work on a 385,000-square-foot mall in Hempstead, which will replace an Abraham &amp; Straus store on the site that closed in 1992.</p>
        <p>In Yaphank, Mr. Breslin said, 500,000 square feet has been leased to three department store tenants, none of which he would name, and 50 smaller stores. The Hempstead space has been fully leased, he said, with the exception of 105,000 square feet that was to have been occupied by Bradlees, a department store chain that has filed for bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>Bradlees and Caldor, another department store that filed for bankruptcy last  year, are victims of "expanding too quickly, paying very high rents, and facing  lots of very severe competition," said Stanley H. Schuckman, president of Schuckman Realty, commercial brokers in Woodbury. The two stores have a total of 17 locations on Long Island, and had been looking for additional locations.</p>
        <p>But brokers say that potential vacancies being created by bankruptcies can also be seen in a positive light.</p>
        <p>"You see retailers failing and you wonder who's going to replace them, and here comes another wave eager to get into the market because of the excellent demographics," said John Thomas, managing director of Select Investment Realty Advisors in Ronkonkoma.</p>
        <p>S TILL, there is a lot more caution in the air, said Arthur D. Sanders, president of Spiegel Associates of Hicksville, owners and developers of retail space. Mr. Sanders said he was working with several large tenants who want to sign short-term leases "while they test the water."</p>
        <p>Yet, one newcomer has been so aggressive about entering the Long Island market that it purchased an existing company.</p>
        <p>The Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company of Quincy, Mass., which has one store under construction in East Setauket and others pending in Roslyn and East Islip, acquired the MelMarkets chain of 17 Foodtown supermarkets on Long Island in December in a transaction valued at $85 million. Stop &amp; Shop focuses on providing a very large selection of foods along with general merchandise such as books, prescription drugs and flowers.</p>
        <p>Overall, brokers say, retailers that have something new and exciting to offer will continue to prosper even in this economy.</p>
        <p>"The ones that can come up with a niche and provide better service and good selection and good quality will do well," said Lawrence Holzman of Lawrence Holzman Inc., a retail leasing consultant in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holzman represents a rapidly growing supermarket chain called Advantage Stores, which is based in Farmingdale.</p>
        <p>Advantage, which describes itself as a hybrid between a traditional supermarket and a warehouse club, opened two stores last year, has a third scheduled to open next Saturday in Bethpage, and expects to have as many as 10 stores open by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The concept, a new one, is to offer a smaller selection of merchandise in a smaller environment, with no membership fee, but at similar discounts offered by warehouse clubs.</p>
        <p>"We are going from zero in revenues in 1994, to $6 million in 1995 and expect to go to $22 million this year," said Brian Robinson, the company's founder and  chief executive officer.</p>
