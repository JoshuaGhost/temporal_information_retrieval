        <p>There is an old description of reporters as people who view the battle from afar and then come down from the hills to shoot the wounded. Political columnists are not so crass. We like to offer lots of free advice and constructive criticism to the wounded first. Then we shoot them.</p>
        <p>Some of that gunfire came from this corner of the paper for the past year, including a fair number of misses. Now that the time has come to pass this space on to someone else, it is probably appropriate that the departing tenant acknowledge that yes, this is the place that broke the news that Bill Bradley was a cinch to run for re-election. (He didn't.) This is where it was first reported that Virginia Littell might put up a fight for the chairmanship of the  State Republcian Commitee against Chuck Haytaian. (Mrs. Littell proved to be far too good a soldier to do such a thing.) And this column also predicted that Governor Whitman's new budget was in trouble because she had failed to find a way to help the state's hospitals pay for charity care. (Nothing came of that, either. Yet.)</p>

        <p>Some of that gunfire came from this corner of the paper for the past year, including a fair number of misses. Now that the time has come to pass this space on to someone else, it is probably appropriate that the departing tenant acknowledge that yes, this is the place that broke the news that Bill Bradley was a cinch to run for re-election. (He didn't.) This is where it was first reported that Virginia Littell might put up a fight for the chairmanship of the  State Republcian Commitee against Chuck Haytaian.

And this column also predicted that Governor Whitman's new budget was in trouble because she had failed to find a way to help the state's hospitals pay for charity care. (Nothing came of that, either. Yet.)</p>
        <p>The people who get this kind of treatment from a reporter and still return his phone calls deserve some kind of salute, even if it makes them feel a bit like the man being ridden out of town a rail who thought that if it were not for the honor, he would just as soon walk. People like Carl Golden, the Governor's spokesman, whose words and insights may have graced these columns far more frequently than his name ever did, and who mostly told the truth, even when he could not tell all of it.</p>
        <p>Of course, some political types do their best work from the shadows, while others can work in broad sunlight and never register, journalistically. Peter Verniero, the Governor's gifted, absurdly young chief of staff, never ducked a question, never hid behind the anonymous quote, never gave away a secret. He also never gave up any information, good lawyer that he is, and so rarely blundered into print here, which is probably the way he wanted it anyway.</p>
        <p>A daily newspaper article about a routine development in Trenton -- a new crime initiative, a problem with the budget -- resembles a piece of theater in its production, and behind the lines of names and numbers that get printed the next day are the unnamed stagehands of state government, departmental spokesmen  and researchers who churn out the details and find the answers that reporters merely pass on.</p>
        <p>Some of these are extraordinarily hard-working and helpful people, people like Bob Friant in the Department of Community Affairs and Richard Vespucci in Education and the soothingly named Winifred Comfort in the department of -- what else? -- Human Services.</p>
        <p>No one could watch the Legislature for a year without also realizing how much the members of both parties have in common, and how well they get along, when they are not busy being politicians. Does anyone believe that there is much of a gap between Senator Peter Inverso of Hamilton, Republican, and Assemblyman Joe Roberts Jr., of Camden, Democrat? Between Gordon Mac Innes of Morris Township, Democrat, and John Bennett of Eatontown, Republican? Between Dick LaRossa and .  . . well, never mind. The point is that the lawmakers have enacted some important measures in recent years, especially in the areas of environment and education, and they did so because for the most part the members of the two houses agree more than they disagree. If you think this is not important, you should spend a few months in Albany, and see what New Yorkers put up with.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, New Jerseyans have a few more years to watch their luminous Governor, who never leaves the state without turning heads. On Wednesday, in its coverage of the National Governors' Association meeting, The Washington Post ran not one but two pictures of Mrs. Whitman, a big one on the front page and another inside the paper. So, clearly, her ability to grab attention is not limited to the State House gang.</p>
        <p>Is she going to be Senator Bob Dole's running mate this year -- she could, without even giving up her office -- or wait until 2000 and run for President on her own?</p>
        <p>Sorry, no more predictions from this corner. Meanwhile, thanks for the work.</p>
