        <p>At least 200 people were injured in fighting today as the Government cracked  down on the leaders of a protest campaign.</p>
        <p>Clashes were reported in Dhaka, the capital; in the southeastern port city of Chittagong, and in four other cities on the second day of a three-day strike.</p>
        <p>The crackdown was the first since three main opposition parties combined in  1994 in a campaign to unseat Prime Minister Khaleda Zia.</p>
        <p>Three opposition leaders were arrested today and Saturday, the first sign of  the tough stand Mrs. Zia had promised to take to end the frequent strikes. The opposition also boycotted a general election 10 days ago.</p>
        <p>Normal life remained crippled. Sunday is a working day in predominantly Muslim Bangladesh, but trains were halted and schools and businesses closed.</p>
        <p>The opposition wants Mrs. Zia to step down and let a neutral caretaker Government hold new elections.</p>
