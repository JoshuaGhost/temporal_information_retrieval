        <p>Despite both an embryonic Presidential campaign and the stock market crash in October 1987, nearly 7 out of 10 Americans were absorbed by something else that  month: the three-day ordeal of "Baby Jessica" McClure, who had tumbled into an abandoned water well in a West Texas oil town. The three major television networks interrupted regular programming to report the rescue. A photograph of Jessica emerging won a Pulitzer Prize. She got to visit the White House. She threw out the first ball on opening day of the Texas Rangers' 1988 season.</p>
        <p>All of which might help to explain why for nearly 17 days in the dead of winter in 1925, during the agonizing lull between the football and basketball seasons, a world without television found itself trapped vicariously 150 feet underground in a Kentucky cave with Floyd Collins.</p>

        <p>Despite both an embryonic Presidential campaign and the stock market crash in October 1987, nearly 7 out of 10 Americans were absorbed by something else that  month: the three-day ordeal of "Baby Jessica" McClure, who had tumbled into an abandoned water well in a West Texas oil town. The three major television networks interrupted regular programming to report the rescue. A photograph of Jessica emerging won a Pulitzer Prize. She got to visit the White House. She threw out the first ball on opening day of the Texas Rangers' 1988 season.</p>
        <p>All of which might help to explain why for nearly 17 days in the dead of winter in 1925, during the agonizing lull between the football and basketball seasons, a world without television found itself trapped vicariously 150 feet underground in a Kentucky cave with Floyd Collins.</p>
        <p>Journalists, even more than nature, abhor a vacuum. Floyd, his lithe 37-year-old frame wedged into a narrow crevice and his left foot buried by a small but unmovable boulder, filled it.</p>
        <p>The story resonated in everybody's everyday fears. It was a metaphor for solitary souls stuck in a rut. At the same time, the media frenzy stretched the  limits of endurance, credulity and technology (inspiring the first sustained use of radio for a non political event; the first trans-Atlantic telephone call placed from Cave City, Ky.; the convening of cameramen from six movie studios and of seven aircraft -- including one piloted by a cadet named Charles Lindbergh -- to carry photographs from the scene).</p>
        <p>The story was chronicled in several books published within six months, in vaudeville appearances by members of the Collins family and other bit players, in a ballad, in films (including the 1951 "Ace in the Hole" directed by Billy Wilder), in television dramas and, most recently, in a musical, opening on March 3 at Playwrights Horizons. Written and directed by Tina Landau, with music and lyrics by Adam Guettel and additional lyrics by Ms. Landau, it is titled "Floyd  Collins," as if to suggest that seven decades later the man's name speaks for itself, even if the details of his life and its outcome may have been forgotten.</p>
        <p>Journalism is an integral part of the play, just as it was of Floyd Collins's story, which he related during his captivity to a 21-year-old reporter for The Louisville Courier-Journal, William (Skeets) Miller, the only journalist small enough to insinuate himself into the dank limestone tunnel and one of the few participants big enough to emerge with his integrity intact.</p>
        <p>"Although we worked to preserve historical accuracy," Ms. Landau and Mr. Guettel write in the program, "it was necessary in some cases to take dramatic liberty and combine characters or compress events." Around Cave City in 1925, neither their goal nor their caveat was universal. The lapses are personified in the play by a natty trio of out-of-town reporters whose song-and-dance routine captures the carnival spirit, if not the letter, of their dispatches.</p>
        <p>Ms. Landau, who is 33, is best known for staging site-specific works like "Stonewall: Night Variations" and "Orestes" for En Garde Arts in remote New York City nooks. Mr. Guettel, the 31-year-old grandson of Richard Rodgers and the son of Mary Rodgers Guettel ("Once Upon a Mattress"), first collaborated with Ms. Landau when they were undergraduates at Yale University.</p>
        <p>Their current piece was born when Ms. Landau, browsing through a Readers Digest anthology, stumbled across the saga of Floyd Collins. Four years later, as opening night nears, "Floyd Collins" is the latest incarnation of an even more operatic version they first staged in Philadelphia at the American Music Theater Festival in 1994.</p>
        <p>A brooding stage set by James Schuette of worn timbers, evocative body language on the part of the 13 actors (Christopher Innvar, in the title role, simulates entrapment without the help of even a pebble), the down-home strains of a banjo and harmonica, startlingly realistic recordings of rock slides and of wooden beams heaving under the weight of saturated limestone -- all combine to evoke the feeling of confinement and of the Promethean struggles for survival taking place below ground and above.</p>
        <p>Music, Mr. Guettel said, produces "colors and emotional shades that aren't reachable with words," although Ms. Landau's book gives voice to the themes of exploitation, of machines doing battle with nature and of life fending off death.</p>
        <p>Ms. Landau and Mr. Guettel have plumbed the characters' emotions and motivations with greater probable accuracy than the news accounts of the day. These from-the-scene reports conjured up tales of Floyd's heartsick lover and his abandoned dog and even suggested that the drama was all a cynical hoax by an inventive explorer to generate tourism for Kentucky's caves.</p>
        <p>Was there any difference between the liberties taken by journalists then and  the literary license in the play?</p>
        <p>"We're true to the spirit of the story, but we are circling it for the most dramatic angle," Mr. Guettel acknowledged.</p>
        <p>During work on an earlier version of "Floyd Collins," Ms. Landau recalled, "I actually wrote in my notebook: 'I don't care any more about the truth.' We realized we couldn't let the historical truth deter us from trying to fill in the drama. We cut a substantial number of characters out, eliminated some of Floyd's siblings and combined two characters. We haven't added to the basic facts, though. What we've invented is interior life -- not characters or action. What we did is what Floyd did -- go down deep."</p>
        <p>Why bother? Why would anyone care about even the deepest feelings of some guy who richly deserved obscurity and whose 17 days of fame were largely the result  of his own negligence?</p>
        <p>One reason might be that it is easier to identify with an individual. When Collins was found, the story led The New York Times front page. Later that year, underground explosions that killed 53 people in North Carolina and 61 in Alabama were relegated to inside pages.</p>
        <p>As the Skeets Miller character says: "Volcanoes bury whole cities. Earthquakes devastate countries. Miners by the hundreds are imprisoned in the bowels of the earth. Why do we all care so much about one man?"</p>
        <p>Perhaps he reveals the answer when he tells the imprisoned Floyd Collins: "I  stare at a half-remembered image -- me -- trapped just like you."</p>
