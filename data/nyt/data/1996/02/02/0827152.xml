        <p>Flames from a mattress set ablaze in a stairwell at a Bronx housing project roared upward 11 floors after igniting layers of old paint under newly applied fire-retardant paint, fire officials said yesterday. Although no one was injured, the fire again raised questions about the city's efforts to deal with such blazes.</p>
        <p>The stairwell, which burned on Wednesday, had been coated in mid-December with fire-retardant paint, after similar blazes in untreated stairwells of city  housing projects resulted in two deaths late last year.</p>
        <p>Officials said the fire was set at 9:30 P.M. in the 16-story apartment building at 730 East 163d Street in Longwood. It became so hot that it ignited the layers of flammable paint underneath the new coat, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a news conference yesterday at City Hall. It was the 22d such blaze in a public housing stairwell coated with the new paint, but only the second in which the flammable layers underneath burned because of the intense heat.</p>
        <p>"We will continue to look at other alternatives," the Mayor said, adding that city housing workers would keep painting the stairwells of housing projects with the fire-retardant paint.</p>
        <p>Fire Commissioner Howard Safir said the fire-retardant paint had probably been applied properly to the surfaces in the stairwell that burned Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>"No paint can withstand a fire of 1,500 to 2,000 degrees," the commissioner said.</p>
        <p>City officials have two alternatives, Mr. Safir added: cover the flammable paint with a nonflammable material or remove the old buildup of flammable paint, a costly undertaking.</p>
        <p>But at a separate news conference at City Hall, Councilman Anthony D. Weiner, chairman of the Council's subcommittee on safety in public housing, said the Giuliani administration should take measures to strip the thick layers of old paint.</p>
        <p>"The only course is to remove the oil-base paint underneath," he said.</p>
        <p>The fire-retardant paint in the Bronx blaze was applied in the stairwell between Dec. 14 and Dec. 17, a city housing official said.</p>
        <p>The fire on Wednesday took about 45 minutes to extinguish, said George Semidey, a Fire Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>A fire marshal who spoke on condition of anonymity said housing officials might consider covering the flammable paint on stairwell walls with plasterboard painted with flame retardant coatings.</p>
