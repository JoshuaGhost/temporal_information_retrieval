        <p>In the first month of 1996 in South Africa, a four-year drought has been declared over, Luciano Pavarotti and Louis Farrakhan have come and gone, there was a massacre of job seekers outside a factory and the Truth Commission geared  up to investigate years of crimes committed in the name of apartheid.</p>
        <p>But who knew? All one has been hearing for weeks is: Bafana Bafana!</p>
        <p>Bafana Bafana is the nickname bestowed on South Africa's national soccer team, which is primarily black but has a white captain, by its doting fans watching the African Cup of Nations. Literally, it means "the boys, the boys" or even "boy boys."</p>
        <p>There's been grumbling that this is insulting to a bunch of grown men, even if what they do is run around in polyester underwear kicking a ball.  There are  mutterings that it carries the patronizing overtones of the bad old days. As a result, there are newspaper contests: "Win 10,000 Rand! Come Up With a New Name  for Bafana Bafana!"</p>
        <p>Not likely. "The people have embraced it," Tokyo Sexwale, the Premier of Gauteng Province, scolded two popular radio hosts this morning. "Why are you guys even debating it?"</p>
        <p>Besides, the suggested replacements have not caught on: "Madiba's Boys" (combining one of President Nelson Mandela's titles as a Xhosa prince with that  "boy" business again). "The Rainbow Warriors" (for the Rainbow Nation).  Next, someone will say, "Hey, how about 'the Springboks'?"</p>
        <p>Stick your head out the car window: "Bafana Bafana! Bafana Bafana! Ba . . ."  Very few team names have rolled so beautifully off the tongue. It speeds up as you say it. It gets louder, all by itself.</p>
        <p>And by the way, it's "buh-fah-nuh-buh-FAH-nuh." It does not rhyme with "banana."</p>
        <p>How's the team doing? In the first game, the fans were relieved when it easily beat well-respected Cameroon 3-0 -- it meant that South Africa, appearing for the first time in the African Cup of Nations, the continent's biggest sports event, wouldn't embarrass the nation.</p>
        <p>Then, playing desultorily, it lost 1-0 to Egypt and barely beat Angola 1-0. The fans began to worry. But it had still qualified for the quarterfinals, where it won a 2-1 thriller against Algeria in a hard rain that saw two offsetting goals scored in less than 30 seconds just at the close of the game.</p>
        <p>Outside the stadium afterward, whole sections of the crowd were still shouting "Shoooooes! Feesh!  Shoooooes! Feesh!" back and forth -- the game's heroes were Mark Fish and John (Shoes) Moshoeu.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday night, the boys thrashed the tournament favorite, Ghana (rhymes  with "Bafana"), 3 to 0. South Africa has 11 official languages and, on the radio, the game seemed to be on in every one. There was dancing in the streets in Soweto.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, they are to play Tunisia for the championship. Tunisia is ranked only No. 6 in Africa, while Ghana was ranked No. 1. Mr. Sexwale, who will be in  Switzerland on his way to the United States, said he would leave standing orders for a victory parade through Johannesburg -- win, lose or draw.</p>
        <p>It's already been forgotten that the defending champions, Nigeria, aren't even here. Nigeria's leader, Gen. Sani Abacha, snubbed the contest because Mr. Mandela called for sanctions after nine dissidents were executed in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>This tournament is the third sports triumph in a year to help unite the races in South Africa. First there was the Springboks World Cup rugby victory last year. Rugby's traditionally Afrikaner fans were gratified to see Mr. Mandela don a green Springbok shirt.</p>
        <p>Today, as if in gratitude, the leading Afrikaans-language newspaper, Beeld, had a huge picture of a soccer game on its front page. More amazingly, the headline was in Zulu: "Yebo Bafana Bafana!" ("Yebo," pronounced "YAY-boh," means "yeah.")</p>
        <p>In November and December, the national cricket squad -- most of whose fans are English-speaking whites and Indians -- slowly overcame a series of eye-closing draws to soundly thump England.</p>
        <p>Now, as soccer -- the "black sport" -- has come to the forefront, many television sets in laps at cricket matches have been tuned to it, and with each  Bafana Bafana victory, there have been more whites in F.N.B. Stadium outside Soweto. This is seen as an act of courage in some quarters, but in fact, there's a lot more soccer hooliganism in England.</p>
        <p>One of the most endearing images of this tournament came as Mr. Mandela visited the team to wish it well.  He walked out in front of the TV cameras holding hands with Neil Tovey, the team's captain. All over Africa, black men who are friends hold hands. Uptight whites do not.</p>
        <p>And soccer fever is catching on in the white suburbs. On Wednesday, a test question in General Knowledge at the expensive, largely white Redhill School was "What does Bafana Bafana mean?"</p>
        <p>Simon Buys, an executive at a local construction company, went to the Algeria game on a barbecue and bus trip organized by a kitchen contractor. "There were 60 of us, about 30 white and 30 black," he said. "We sat all mixed up, we all had beers, we all acted like South Africans -- nothing else. Most of us don't know all the black songs, like 'Shosholoza,' but we certainly tried. We really had a super day."</p>
