        <p>THE Ubu Repertory Theater has a mission: to acquaint American audiences with  contemporary French-language plays by presenting them in translation. The current work, "Always Together," which runs through next Sunday, is a partly autobiographical drama by Anca Visdei, a Romanian-born writer now living in Paris.</p>
        <p>It is the story of two sisters on opposite sides of the Iron Curtain. Alexandra, an 18-year-old playwright (played by Maria Deasy, above left), emigrates to Switzerland, while her sister, Ioana, 17, an actress (Thea Mercouffer, at right), remains in Bucharest. They correspond for years, finally  reuniting in 1989 after the fall of the Ceausescu regime.</p>
