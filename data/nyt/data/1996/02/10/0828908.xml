        <p>Some expatriates go native; others cling to the old homeland ways. Spacehog,  a band of Englishmen formed in New York, revels in a British rock heritage that  extends from the Kinks to the Clash, with special attention to glam-rock. At Irving Plaza on Thursday night, the four musicians, all from Leeds, pouted and bantered in ways learned from three decades' worth of English rockers. At one point, they urged fans to shout, "Get on with it!"</p>
        <p>Since the Beatles, English rockers have been torn between imitating American  models and avoiding them. Avoidance is making a comeback; at the moment, bands like Blur, Suede, Oasis, Elastica and Supergrass are revisiting various eras of  English rock. Spacehog represents a trans-Atlantic wing of the same movement. New York has its own glam-rock subculture, spearheaded by D Generation, but Spacehog rejects the gutter-proud trashiness of New York glam; "You don't have to be a down and out to be down sometimes," Royston Langdon insists in "Cruel to Be Kind," from the band's album, "Resident Alien" (Sire).</p>

        <p>Some expatriates go native; others cling to the old homeland ways. Spacehog,  a band of Englishmen formed in New York, revels in a British rock heritage that  extends from the Kinks to the Clash, with special attention to glam-rock. At Irving Plaza on Thursday night, the four musicians, all from Leeds, pouted and bantered in ways learned from three decades' worth of English rockers. At one point, they urged fans to shout, "Get on with it!"</p>
        <p>Since the Beatles, English rockers have been torn between imitating American  models and avoiding them. Avoidance is making a comeback; at the moment, bands like Blur, Suede, Oasis, Elastica and Supergrass are revisiting various eras of  English rock. Spacehog represents a trans-Atlantic wing of the same movement. New York has its own glam-rock subculture, spearheaded by D Generation, but Spacehog rejects the gutter-proud trashiness of New York glam; "You don't have to be a down and out to be down sometimes," Royston Langdon insists in "Cruel to Be Kind," from the band's album, "Resident Alien" (Sire).</p>
        <p>While most of Spacehog's lyrics avoid English details -- no prams, bonnets or cups of tea -- its music unabashedly revives the sound of Mott the Hoople and the Spiders from Mars. Royston and Antony Langdon write midtempo songs with swaggering fuzz-toned guitar chords; Royston, Spacehog's bassist, belts them like mid-1970's anthems, with choruses made for arena-size sing-alongs. He has a dramatic baritone with Mr. Bowie's broad vibrato and unrestrained falsetto, although he often adds a rasp directly from Axl Rose.</p>
        <p>The Langdon brothers bring back glam-rock's emotional core: a sense of alienation as heroism, confessing loneliness as a way to rally a crowd. "When I  cry for me I cry for you," the band proclaimed in "In the Meantime." Like early-1970's Bowie, Spacehog is also fascinated by androgyny and outer space, and it wants to find a way "between the cracks of shallow lives." While its style is borrowed, Spacehog has the melodies, the fervor and the pugnacity to make glam-rock ring true again.</p>
        <p>Tracy Bonham, a songwriter from Boston, shared the bill, leading a four-piece band in assertive songs about leaving home and contending with men. Although the music fit too snugly into the pigeonhole of Boston collegiate-rock -- they often recalled the Pixies as they moved from sweetness to stomp -- Ms. Bonham has a promising command of both tunes and tirades.</p>
