        <p>Bosnian Serb military commanders, in a move senior NATO officials called a clear violation of the Bosnia peace accord, have severed all communication with  NATO to protest the imprisonment of two Bosnian Serb officers.</p>
        <p>And the unrest that has been brewing since the arrests on Jan. 30 is spreading through the area.</p>
        <p>Lieut. Gen. Sir Michael Walker, commander of the NATO peacekeeping force in  Sarajevo, said today, "We have a number of liaison officers who are in the Bosnian Serb military, with whom we inevitably have contact, but in terms of the high-level, strategic-type contact that we had with them, there is none."</p>
        <p>He called the move "an ominous sign" and a "direct breach" of the Dayton accord.</p>
        <p>The Bosnian Serbs say they will not resume contact until the two officers being held on suspicion of war crimes are released.</p>
        <p>The deployment of the peacekeeping force has, until now, allowed Muslims and  Croats to travel through the Serb-held suburbs. But on Thursday night the self-styled Justice Minister of the Bosnian Serbs, Marko Arsic, said that unless the Serbian officers were released immediately, Muslims and Croats who crossed through the Serbian suburbs would be arrested.</p>
        <p>There have also been recent reports of beatings. Four drivers were hospitalized in the Government-controlled part of Sarajevo after they were apparently beaten on Thursday night by armed Serbs as they were waiting to cross into the city.</p>
        <p>Bosnian Serb moderates who, like the Mayor of this Serbian-held suburb of Sarajevo, have cooperated with the NATO force have been denounced as "traitors"  by the Bosnian Serb news media.</p>
        <p>The moderates, who oppose the severing of relations with NATO, say that their leaders, based in Pale, have decided to create a crisis. Their plan is drive the 50,000 Serbs in the five Serbian-held suburbs around Sarajevo out of their homes and house them in tents.</p>
        <p>The five suburbs are due to be handed back to the Bosnian Government on March 19, and United Nations officials have been trying to create a mixed Serbian and  Muslim police force to provide enough security so the Serbs can remain in their  homes.</p>
        <p>"It is hard to say what the leadership in Pale really wants now," said Nedjelko Prstajevic, the Mayor of Ilidza, "but everything it is doing now is counterproductive if we want to reach a peaceful solution. To push our people out of their homes when the international community clearly wants to help us stay in Sarajevo will be a terrible error. But this will be the result if we cut off cooperation" with the NATO force.</p>
        <p>The decision by the Bosnian Serbs to turn their backs on NATO and the United  Nations agencies trying to carry out the peace agreement imperils a variety of negotiations, including those on prisoner exchanges and the demarcation of buffer zones.</p>
        <p>The commander of the NATO mission, Adm. Leighton Smith, called for international "political and diplomatic pressure to get these people back in line to the agreement these people freely signed up to."</p>
        <p>The officers in custody, Gen. Djordje Djukic and Col. Aleksa Krsmanovic, were detained by the Bosnian Government after they made a wrong turn into Government-held territory outside Sarajevo.</p>
        <p>General Walker tried to get them released, but ended the effort after the arrests were endorsed by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. The tribunal wants the two held until it decides whether to indict them on charges they were involved in wartime executions in the Sarajevo area.</p>
        <p>A NATO official characterized the tribunal's decision as "throwing fuel on the fire."</p>
        <p>Assistant Secretary of State Richard C. Holbrooke, who brokered the Bosnian peace accord, will arrive in the Balkans on Sunday to try to resolve the rupture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke said he was hoping to "calm down the tension that has grown considerably in recent days."</p>
        <p>The order to cut ties with the alliance came from the Bosnian Serb military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic, who has been indicted on war crimes charges by the tribunal.</p>
        <p>General Mladic has banned civilians in Serb territory from crossing into other parts of Bosnia, and has ordered Muslims and Croats to stay out of Serbian-held Bosnia.</p>
