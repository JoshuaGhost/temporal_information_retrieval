        <p>Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana said today that he would concentrate on New England's regional primary in two weeks, hoping to use it to breathe life into a Presidential campaign that has yet to do better than fifth place.</p>
        <p>With money running low, Mr. Lugar re-examined his strategy and decided to forgo five primaries in the next 10 days in favor of New England's primaries on  March 5.</p>
        <p>Despite finishing seventh in Iowa last week and fifth in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Mr. Lugar said he was optimistic he could compete effectively in the crowded Republican field by honing his message and limiting his audience.</p>
        <p>"Less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the Republican voters in this country have had a chance to cast a ballot," he said here on the first stop in his refocused campaign.</p>
        <p>Voters in Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut will cast Presidential primary ballots on March 5. By focusing on those states, Mr. Lugar said, he will be skipping primaries during the next two weeks in Delaware, Arizona, North Dakota, South Dakota and South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar's New England campaign will feature advertising and more visits to  the region, aides said.</p>
        <p>The Senator said he was forced by a shortage of cash to limit his campaign. But he said all of the candidates, except Senator Bob Dole of Kansas and Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher, were being forced to do the same thing.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dole's less-than-dominant showings in Iowa and New Hampshire are lifting the four other leading campaigns, Mr. Lugar said, listing his own and those of Mr. Forbes, Patrick J. Buchanan and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar said he believed that he could exploit the muddle at the head of the candidate pack by focusing on the smaller New England states, where it should be easier to get his message out. Although New England does not offer a big electoral prize, a victory or respectable showing in any of the five states  would boost lift could jump start the Lugar campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lugar said he would avoid negative campaigning but went on to list the shortcomings of his opponents.</p>
        <p>He cited Mr. Dole's seeming weakness with voters, Mr. Alexander's lack of Washington experience, Mr. Forbes's inexperience and negative campaigning and Mr. Buchanan's divisiveness.</p>
        <p>He was especially critical of Mr. Buchanan, whose nomination he said would guarantee a Republican loss in November.</p>
        <p>"I think that all of them have substantial difficulties," Mr. Lugar said. "I  would not be running if I did not feel I was the best candidate."</p>
