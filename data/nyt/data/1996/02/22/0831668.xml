        <p>It isn't what most people would think of as a sexually tantalizing smell: floral, fruity and unquestionably synthetic, it is as welcome to the nostrils as a vinyl handkerchief. But for the blowzy, middle-aged Kath, played to pulpy perfection by Ellen Parker in the new revival of Joe Orton's "Entertaining Mr. Sloane," this aerosol room freshener is just what's needed for seducing a strapping lad with the smoothest skin she's ever seen.</p>
        <p>Smell, thank goodness, is not a sense that's much exploited in the theater. But when Ms. Parker's strawberry spray wafts into the audience at the Classic Stage Company, it feels ingeniously apt, an aromatic equivalent of what you've been hearing on stage. Orton's characters do indeed seem to speak the verbal equivalent of cheap air freshener: a canned amalgam of bourgeois pieties and dime-novel sentiments that never conceal the gamy lust and avarice beneath.</p>

        <p>It isn't what most people would think of as a sexually tantalizing smell: floral, fruity and unquestionably synthetic, it is as welcome to the nostrils as a vinyl handkerchief. But for the blowzy, middle-aged Kath, played to pulpy perfection by Ellen Parker in the new revival of Joe Orton's "Entertaining Mr. Sloane," this aerosol room freshener is just what's needed for seducing a strapping lad with the smoothest skin she's ever seen.</p>
        <p>Smell, thank goodness, is not a sense that's much exploited in the theater. But when Ms. Parker's strawberry spray wafts into the audience at the Classic Stage Company, it feels ingeniously apt, an aromatic equivalent of what you've been hearing on stage. Orton's characters do indeed seem to speak the verbal equivalent of cheap air freshener: a canned amalgam of bourgeois pieties and dime-novel sentiments that never conceal the gamy lust and avarice beneath.</p>
        <p>The appeal of this deliciously dark-minded comedy from 1964 rests more completely on language than do Orton's masterpieces of physical farce, "Loot" and "What the Butler Saw." But the new Classic Stage production, directed by David Esbjornson, cleverly scales up the sensory experience of the show, carried out to the last garish, eye-popping detail of Narelle Sissons' sets and Michael  Krass's costumes. And in so doing, it deftly mirrors the tacky social surfaces with which the characters overlay all manner of ungodly acts.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Orton's amoral creatures can get away with absolutely anything -- murder, sexual blackmail and one of the sickest menages a trois in theater history -- as long as there's an oily platitude at hand. This, after all, is a play in which the title character (Neil Maffin), after kicking an old man into insensibility, murmurs blandly, "All this could have been avoided." And in which Kath speaks sweetly of her maternal instincts while planting a kiss on Sloane's lips that is anything but motherly.</p>
        <p>The key to playing Orton's hypocrites -- as opposed to, say, Moliere's or Wycherly's -- is in never acknowledging any contradiction between word and deed. Fortunately, this is a fact of which Mr. Esbjornson's crackerjack four-member ensemble, rounded out by Brian Murray and George Hall, are acutely and enjoyably aware.</p>
        <p>The pivot of the play is Sloane, a wastrel Adonis whom Kath, a girlish frump  with delusions of gentility, brings home as a lodger. Never mind that he can't pay the rent; Mr. Sloane, as she will insist on addressing him, is most useful in other ways.</p>
        <p>There are complications. Kath's geriatric father (Mr. Hall) doesn't like the  intruder, whom he seems to remember in connection with a murder. And Kath's brother, Ed (Mr. Murray), a loutish businessman with a deep-felt nostalgia for the "pure" pleasures of boyhood athletics, hires the lad as a chauffeur, with the clear possibility of optional services.</p>
        <p>There will be a death, a pregnancy and two violent assaults before the show is over. But the characters' Teflon dialogue can accommodate all this with the same chipper vapidity with which Kath describes those pretty tulips over by the  municipal offices. In Orton's world, steeped on a daily brew of television, B-movies, tabloids and threadbare saws, denaturized language has become both anesthetic and ultimate defense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Esbjornson's production occasionally flirts with a dangerous, self-conscious jokiness. But he understands that the momentum of "Sloane" relies on a sustained perception of shifting power among its characters, a process to which his actors are finely tuned.</p>
        <p>Mr. Maffin, an atypically lanky, Nordic Sloane, turns his height into the perfect territorial weapon as he roams over the furniture like an overgrown cat. And he locates Sloane's essential passivity, molding himself into the wayward son, assaultive thug or sports-loving mate that each of the others expects him to be.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray plays his character's perversely righteous anger beautifully. Mr.  Hall artfully suggests shrewdness and senility in one breath. But it is Ms. Parker's Kath, a faded butterfly of fluttering affectations and a spine of steel, who best embodies the Orton paradox. And when she primly says to Sloane,  "Kiss my hand, dear, in the manner of the theater," she takes utter possession of the show.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sissons' conception of what Kath coyly describes as "my lounge" is a lurid marvel of mixed floral patterns and textures, a set that somehow seems to  assault the sense of touch as well as sight. The production gives off an almost  palpable sense of physical surfaces.</p>
        <p>The ways the characters run their fingers over upholstery and clothing take on an obsessive quality in which carnality and consumerism blend seamlessly. And when Kath talks about the smoothness of Sloane's skin, it is chillingly similar  to the way she speaks of her newly repaired china shepherdess.</p>
        <p>Obviously, for both Ed and Kath, whose calculating eyes belie their talk of rehabilitating their poor orphan boy, Mr. Sloane is just another material comfort, like a nice cigarette case or lawn gnome. For all his thuggish amorality, he is no match for this cast-iron culture of appearances. The gratifying strength of Mr. Esbjornson's production is its gleeful embrace of the premise that surface is indeed everything.</p>
