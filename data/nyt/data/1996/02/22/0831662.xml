        <p>A lot of Republicans do not see Pat Buchanan as a joke, not any longer," Dan Rather said with high anchorman's seriousness on Tuesday night, not long before  CBS projected that Mr. Buchanan would win the Republican primary in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, at the Comedy Central channel, which is covering the Presidential campaign under the banner "Indecision '96," the attitude was pretty much "Speak for yourself, Dan." Everyone from President Clinton to Mr. Buchanan becomes material at Comedy Central, and in an era of numbing press overload its coverage sometimes makes more sense than that of humorless reporters. The channel's standard-bearing talk show, "Politically Incorrect," is almost single-handedly reviving political satire on television.</p>
        <p>With the comedian Bill Maher as host, "Politically Incorrect" deftly mixes guests from the world of politics and show biz, and keeps them on track as they  discuss everything from gun control to the nature of celebrity. The show has become so successful that it has been snatched up by ABC, where it is to follow  "Nightline" next year. It will stay on Comedy Central with new shows through the Presidential election. (It is shown every weeknight at 11, though Monday shows are repeats.)</p>

        <p>A lot of Republicans do not see Pat Buchanan as a joke, not any longer," Dan Rather said with high anchorman's seriousness on Tuesday night, not long before  CBS projected that Mr. Buchanan would win the Republican primary in New Hampshire. Meanwhile, at the Comedy Central channel, which is covering the Presidential campaign under the banner "Indecision '96," the attitude was pretty much "Speak for yourself, Dan." Everyone from President Clinton to Mr. Buchanan becomes material at Comedy Central, and in an era of numbing press overload its coverage sometimes makes more sense than that of humorless reporters. The channel's standard-bearing talk show, "Politically Incorrect," is almost single-handedly reviving political satire on television.</p>
        <p>With the comedian Bill Maher as host, "Politically Incorrect" deftly mixes guests from the world of politics and show biz, and keeps them on track as they  discuss everything from gun control to the nature of celebrity. The show has become so successful that it has been snatched up by ABC, where it is to follow  "Nightline" next year. It will stay on Comedy Central with new shows through the Presidential election. (It is shown every weeknight at 11, though Monday shows are repeats.)</p>
        <p>Whether such a show can thrive at ABC is a wide-open question. One reason there is so little sharp political satire on television is that the form requires the freedom to take risks. It's no coincidence that satire on broadcast networks has become tame and unfunny, like the "Weekend Update" segment of "Saturday Night Live." The only truly risky satire is on cable, with "Politically Incorrect" and HBO's even edgier "Dennis Miller Live" (Fridays at 11:30). The economic stakes are lower and the language is looser. Bill Maher and Dennis Miller rely on a bluntness (the words "Buchanan" and "white supremacist" are a popular combination on "Politically Incorrect") that is hard  to find anywhere else.</p>
        <p>But "Politically Incorrect" has pulled off the rare trick of being irreverent without becoming irrelevant. It does this by using a healthy dose of common sense. The show is at its best when Mr. Maher and his guests don't strain to say outrageous things, but merely express what average viewers might have been thinking.</p>
        <p>That approach was hilariously evident on Tuesday, when "Politically Incorrect" broke with its format and featured live reports from Chris Rock (once of "Saturday Night Live") in Manchester. It was after 11, Senator Bob Dole had come in second in the primary and Mr. Maher asked the traditional anchorman's question. "Chris, what's the mood there at Dole headquarters?"</p>
        <p>"It's total denial," Mr. Rock answered. "It's like a community college pep rally. You'd think they won." That's exactly what some of us have been waiting years to hear a reporter say about a losing candidate's crowd.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Mr. Maher had two guests instead of four, "one from the left and  one from the right," as he put it, which is usually a bad "Crossfire" idea. Heather Richardson Higgins, from the conservative Progress and Freedom Foundation, was backpedaling hard about Mr. Buchanan's victory, insisting "the Republican party will never let him be the candidate." She was sparring with Al  Franken, a master television satirist and author, whose new book, "Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations," is a best seller.</p>
        <p>Combining entertainment and political observations, the book shares a satiric sensibility with "Politically Incorrect." The title of Mr. Franken's book lets him have it both ways: he gets a cheap laugh, and also parodies the typically low level of political commentary and humor. (What is the title, after all, except a satiric equivalent of those endless Clinton-at-McDonalds jokes?)</p>
        <p>"Politically Incorrect" is more impartial; the Republicans just happen to be  slugging it out right now.  But it relies on Mr. Maher's savvy sense of when to  get serious, when to joke and how to combine the two. The show lives or dies on  his quick-witted response to guests.</p>
        <p>When "Politically Incorrect" moved from New York to Hollywood last month, there was no significant change; it had always relied too much on celebrity guests. Some of them are smart and funny, some wearyingly sincere and some are just airheads. It is Mr. Maher's job to save them from themselves. When the film director Arthur Hiller turned up in the wearyingly sincere category, slowly intoning against Mr. Dole's attacks on Hollywood, Mr. Maher broke in with a lively, "You go, girl!" But on another show, when the actress Maria Conchita Alonso insisted that scientific tests should be done on convicted rapists instead of innocent bunnies, Mr. Maher found it impossible to regain control.</p>
        <p>Sometimes an unlikely mix works. Star Jones, from "Inside Edition," and the actor Michael Gross recently took up the issue of a candidate for the Los Angeles Police Department who was turned down because he admitted to telling a racial joke. The question became: "What's worse? Being racist or dishonest about it?" This kind of lucid discussion would be hard to find on any other show.</p>
        <p>It's not a good sign that Al Franken, Chris Rock and Dennis Miller are all refugees from the floundering "Saturday Night Live." When "Politically Incorrect" tries to bring its satire back to the networks, it will find out how  far irreverence and common sense can go.</p>
