        <p>The Genzyme Corporation said yesterday that it planned to buy Genetrix Inc.,  a genetic testing lab based in Phoenix, for about $36.7 million in stock. Genetrix will be merged with Genzyme's Integrated Genetics diagnostic services business, helping Genzyme to cut costs and offer services in a broader geographic area, said Henri A. Termeer, the chairman and chief executive of Genzyme. The annual genetic testing revenue for the combined operation was estimated at $75 million. Genzyme, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., makes drugs and provides other health care products and services. The deal is expected to be completed in March.</p>
