        <p>The characters in Craig Lucas's "Blue Window," directed by Joe Mantello, are  introduced with an image of luminous intensity: framed within an inky darkness,  picked out by individual spotlights, seven faces stare at us from the stage. They could be holograms in a fun house, or still-living, if disembodied, heads that have been stashed away in some Bluebeard's closet. They float in a dark void.</p>
        <p>When the lights come up, as they do all too soon, it's a distinct anticlimax  to realize that we're back in middle-class Manhattan, watching people who earnestly want to improve their minds and bodies, yearn for love, buy books they don't read, trade put-downs and joke about psychiatry. Thus begins the revival of Mr. Lucas's 1984 comedy, which opened last night at the Manhattan Theater Club.</p>

        <p>The characters in Craig Lucas's "Blue Window," directed by Joe Mantello, are  introduced with an image of luminous intensity: framed within an inky darkness,  picked out by individual spotlights, seven faces stare at us from the stage. They could be holograms in a fun house, or still-living, if disembodied, heads that have been stashed away in some Bluebeard's closet. They float in a dark void.</p>
        <p>When the lights come up, as they do all too soon, it's a distinct anticlimax  to realize that we're back in middle-class Manhattan, watching people who earnestly want to improve their minds and bodies, yearn for love, buy books they don't read, trade put-downs and joke about psychiatry. Thus begins the revival of Mr. Lucas's 1984 comedy, which opened last night at the Manhattan Theater Club.</p>
        <p>The principal event in the play is a dinner party to which Libby, a painfully insecure woman in her 30's, has invited six friends. They're all more  or less her age, but only one of them does she know well. He's Griever, a gay member of her therapy group. The other guests are Tom, who plays a guitar, and his girlfriend Emily; Boo, a family therapist, and her roommate, Alice, a novelist; and Norbert, who identifies himself as a sky diver, though that doesn't appear to be his occupation.</p>
        <p>An air of mystery initially hangs over the play, hinting that we may be in J. B. Priestley territory. The eerie opening tableau is followed by a scene in which all seven characters occupy the same apartment set, although they clearly  are in their own flats. As they talk over and around one another, preparing for  the party, Mr. Lucas seems to be suggesting a kinship that goes beyond social to psychic.</p>
        <p>Instead, it's efficient playwriting, though the play doesn't much benefit from it. We learn that Griever (John Benjamin Hickey) cares a great deal about clothes and is a fan of Diana Ross, that Boo (Allison Janney) and Alice (Ellen McLaughlin) have a bristly love relationship, that Norbert (David Aaron Baker) is a loner, that Tom (David Warshofsky) and Emily (Johanna Day), who are especially empty slates, live together, and that Libby (J. Smith-Cameron) isn't  used to giving parties. She breaks a cap on her tooth just before the guests arrive and spends the rest of the evening talking shyly behind a forefinger held to her mouth.</p>
        <p>The only revelation, which comes late in the play's 90 intermissionless minutes, is Libby's story of the traumatic event that has made it impossible for her to allow anyone to touch her. I can't reveal it here, but I will say that although it's grim, it's also so wildly particular it's almost funny.</p>
        <p>After "Blue Window," Mr. Lucas went on to write the screenplay for "Longtime  Companion" and the much more theatrically effective "Prelude to a Kiss," among other works. "Blue Window" is a play that seems to be waiting for a train: it's  composed of random riffs whose only purpose is to pass the time, which still seems endless.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Lucas has an ear for the nutty way people talk, he seems unable to take that gift and transform it into evocative drama or comedy. The point of "Blue Window" escapes me. Even its wisecracks irritate, being as self-congratulatory as puns.</p>
        <p>Just why the Manhattan Theater Club wanted to revive the play is a mystery. Having made the decision, however, they have given it as good a production as the material allows. Robert Brill's sets and Brian MacDevitt's lighting are elegant, but most of all it's Mr. Mantello's direction of the game, talented cast that soothes.</p>
