        <p>The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, propelled by an overnight rally in Asia, but the gains failed to extend to trading against other currencies.</p>
        <p>The rally against the yen began after the Japanese Government announced plans to deregulate its pension-fund market. The Finance Ministry said it would ease restrictions on foreign investments and currency transactions to encourage the flow of capital into overseas investments, which it said should reinforce the recent trend of a weaker yen.</p>

        <p>The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday, propelled by an overnight rally in Asia, but the gains failed to extend to trading against other currencies.</p>
        <p>The rally against the yen began after the Japanese Government announced plans to deregulate its pension-fund market. The Finance Ministry said it would ease restrictions on foreign investments and currency transactions to encourage the flow of capital into overseas investments, which it said should reinforce the recent trend of a weaker yen.</p>
        <p>The announcement of the deregulation package caught a lot of people off guard," said Mike Malpede, senior foreign exchange analyst at the Refco Group.</p>
        <p>The dollar rallied slightly more than a yen in Asia, to a high of 107.10 yen, but did not go higher for the rest of the session.</p>
        <p>The yen's weakness against the German mark helped keep the dollar in check against the currency, traders said. The mark reached a two-week high against the yen.</p>
        <p>Most of the trading yesterday was focused on marks against yen, said Dan O'Connell, vice president for institutional foreign exchange at First Chicago NBD. "We're seeing a little bit of yen weakness against the mark," he said.</p>
        <p>In New York late yesterday, the dollar was trading at 1.4755 marks, down from 1.4770 on Wednesday. It finished at 106.95 yen, compared with 106.10 the day before. The British pound edged up to $1.5378, from $1.5368.</p>
        <p>The narrowness of the dollar rally discouraged some traders. The Japanese deregulation, combined with reports that the Bank of Japan had intervened to buy dollars earlier this week, produced a meager overall gain of only 2 yen.</p>
        <p>"The key is the lack of follow-through demand," Mr. Malpede of Refco said. "That should be telling you something."</p>
        <p>Japanese investors might not care to take advantage of the relaxed rules. Japanese companies also repatriate much of their foreign capital at the end of the fiscal year on March 31, suggesting little impact from the deregulation in the weeks ahead.</p>
        <p>"It doesn't change a whole lot because the investment community doesn't seem  to care," Mr. Malpede said. "They weren't clamoring to get this change."</p>
