        <p>In tones suggesting the difficulty of keeping the Northern Ireland peace discussions on track, the Irish Prime Minister today sharply criticized Britain's approach, and the Irish Republican Army's political representatives said the effort had collapsed.</p>
        <p>After playing down the deep rifts between them in the immediate aftermath of  the bombing by the I.R.A. of an East London neighborhood on Friday night, the parties to the province's long sectarian conflict reiterated their commitment to peace but again asserted their opposing positions with no hint of compromise.</p>
        <p>The bomb, which exploded just after the I.R.A. called off a 17-month-old cease-fire, killed 2 people, wounded 100 and devastated portions of an office complex, doing damage estimated at well over $100 million.</p>
        <p>The police have made no arrests. They warned tonight that the I.R.A. could strike again "any time, anywhere" in Britain and called for increased public vigilance.</p>
        <p>All sides have emphasized that the bomb should not necessarily mean an end to peaceful efforts to resolve whether Northern Ireland should remain part of Britain, unite with the predominantly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland or adopt some other status. Tonight the British Government's Northern Ireland committee met at 10 Downing Street to develop its post-bombing strategy.</p>
        <p>The peace effort is "very seriously injured, but it's not terminally injured  and we're going to keep it going," Sir Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, said before the meeting.</p>
        <p>But the statements from political leaders today made clear that even if the I.R.A. can be persuaded to adopt a new cease-fire, progress will remain blocked  by a dispute over when it should begin turning in its weapons and by Britain's desire to hold elections in the province as a first step toward full-scale negotiations.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister John Bruton of Ireland has long objected to Britain's insistence that the I.R.A. begin handing over explosives and guns before its political wing, Sinn Fein, can join in full-fledged negotiations among all the interested parties over the province's future.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Bruton went further, saying that Britain's continued push for elections in Northern Ireland to what would become a negotiating forum would badly alienate Sinn Fein and the Catholic minority in the North, which see elections as inevitably favoring the Unionist parties representing the Protestant, pro-British majority.</p>
        <p>"I believe the idea of having an election of the kind suggested immediately after the resumption of violence would pour petrol on the flames," Mr. Bruton said in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation. "I think it would be a serious mistake."</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruton restated Ireland's proposal for a Bosnia-style peace conference in which all parties would be present but would not necessarily negotiate directly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bruton also criticized Mr. Major's refusal to give serious consideration  to a recommendation last month from an international commission led by former Senator George Mitchell of Maine. The commission said Britain should allow Sinn  Fein to take part in all-party talks on the presumption that the I.R.A. would begin disarming as the talks progressed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Major ignored the recommendation, and in a presentation in Parliament instead made his proposal for elections. "This open-and-shut presentation in the House of Commons was a mistake," Mr. Bruton said.</p>
        <p>Sinn Fein's No. 2 official, Mitchell McLaughlin, said the bombing had effectively ended the peace effort. In what has become Sinn Fein's primary response to the bombing, Mr. McLaughlin said the I.R.A.'s resumption of violence was an inevitable result of the British Government's failure to push forward by  beginning full-scale talks including Sinn Fein.</p>
        <p>He said that the process could be resumed, but offered no suggestion that the I.R.A. would ever budge from its refusal to turn over weapons before negotiations.</p>
        <p>"We are prepared to play our full role in convincing people who resort to armed struggle that there is an efficient and an effective alternative, but we cannot do it on our own," Mr. McLaughlin told the BBC.</p>
        <p>"Unfortunately, because over an 18-month period the British Government didn't join the process themselves and made no attempts to bring the Unionists on board, the peace process which was constructed over many years has collapsed," Mr. McLaughlin said. "Now we have to go back to the drawing board and start to rebuild it yet again."</p>
        <p>Sinn Fein representatives said they viewed Prime Minister John Major as increasingly tied to the interests of the Unionists because of British electoral politics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Major's Conservative Party has a majority of only 3 in the 650-member House of Commons and could become reliant on the 9 votes of the Ulster Unionist  Party to remain in power until the general election due in 14 months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Major has enjoyed support for his Northern Ireland strategy from across the British political spectrum, and the bombing only confirmed the belief of politicians from all of the major parties that it would have been naive to open  negotiations with Sinn Fein before the I.R.A. began disarming. There were no signs that the British public, which has little if any sympathy for the I.R.A.,  blamed Mr. Major for not moving fast enough to bring Sinn Fein into negotiations.</p>
        <p>Investigators continued to comb through the site of the blast, near the Canary Wharf office complex along the Thames several miles east of the Houses of Parliament.</p>
