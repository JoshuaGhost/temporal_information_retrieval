        <p>The Clinton-Gore campaign and the two men who happen to head it came barnstorming into New York and New Jersey yesterday, shaking the money tree, touching political bases in a pair of states vital to their re-election and offering a vigorous defense of Felix G.

        <p>The Clinton-Gore campaign and the two men who happen to head it came barnstorming into New York and New Jersey yesterday, shaking the money tree, touching political bases in a pair of states vital to their re-election and offering a vigorous defense of Felix G. Rohatyn and pro-growth economic policies.</p>
        <p>In a packed fund-raising dinner in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Clinton was well into a half-hour recitation of his record in office when he lashed out sharply at Republican Congressional critics who had led Mr. Rohatyn, the New York investment banker, to withdraw his candidacy for nomination as vice chairman of  the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
        <p>The President denounced such attacks as "outrageous political treatment," asked the audience to applaud Mr. Rohatyn -- who was in the ballroom of the Sheraton New York -- and said that the Government should vigorously debate how fast the economy could grow without prompting too much inflation.</p>
        <p>"That's what I wanted to see done," Mr. Clinton added. "And that's why I wanted to put Felix Rohatyn on the Federal Reserve. But the politics of Washington said, no, we insist on the conventional wisdom, we insist on holding  people down, we don't even think it's worth debating -- over and out. That is wrong, and we must end that kind of thinking if we want this country to grow and prosper and become what it ought to be."</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton spent a good part of the day trying to insure that his own re-election campaign would grow and prosper. Together with Vice President Al Gore, he stopped at the Christopher Columbus middle school in Union City, N.J., to tout computers in schools, then plunged into Manhattan through the Lincoln Tunnel in a rare, time-saving trip in the same black armored Cadillac, with all the tubes closed to other traffic.</p>
        <p>Hours later, with the help of celebrities like James Earl Jones, Kathleen Turner, Billy Baldwin and Lesley (no relation) Gore, the campaign raised more than $1 million for the re-election effort in a $1,000-a-plate gala at the Sheraton, and a lower-priced party at the Webster Hall nightclub sponsored by the nationwide network of young Clintonians known as the Saxophone Club.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Mr. Clinton won New Jersey for the Democrats for the first time since 1964, and pulled just over 50 percent of the vote in New York, the only state besides Arkansas where he won a majority. This one-day whirlwind visit --  sandwiched between tours of flooded areas in the Pacific Northwest and Pennsylvania -- was a preseason twofer, proof that his campaign is leaving nothing to chance.</p>
        <p>The President's remarks about Mr. Rohatyn were by far the most pointed anyone at the White House has yet made. By praising Mr. Rohatyn so strongly, Mr. Clinton seemed to imply at least mild criticism of the stringent tight-money policies of the current Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan, whom the White House has acknowledged he intends to re-appoint.</p>
        <p>But after the speech, the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, took some pains to insist that Mr. Clinton had meant no criticism of either the chairman, or of the Federal Reserve Board's independent deliberations, and was only saying that "the Fed needs to take those pro-growth arguments into account."</p>
        <p>The President's remarks were also clearly intended to appeal to Mr. Rohatyn's hometown crowd, and the ballroom was filled with prominent business and political figures from former Mayor David N. Dinkins to Ronald O. Perelman, the  billionaire chairman of Revlon, and his wife, Patricia Duff, who sat at Mr. Clinton's table.</p>
        <p>Earlier, in his hotel suite, the President also met privately with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, and with black and Hispanic elected officials from around New York City, including State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Borough President Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx (a fellow client of Mr. Clinton's political strategist, Dick Morris).</p>
        <p>In New Jersey, Mr. Clinton announced a plan to set aside $2 billion in Federal education funds over the next five years to help match state, local and  private sector efforts to bring computers to schools.</p>
        <p>"When I was young, I thought the future was there for every American who would work for it," Mr. Clinton told students, teachers and parents from Christopher Columbus, a gritty urban school in the heart of Union City where a pilot project in computer education sponsored by the Bell Atlantic Corporation has put test scores 10 points above the statewide average and sent attendance rates soaring.</p>
        <p>"It turned out to be true for my generation. It will be true for this generation, too, and it will be a bigger, brighter, broader future, but only if  we bring the benefits of the information revolution to every single one of them."</p>
        <p>Harold M. Ickes, the New York labor lawyer and veteran Democratic campaign operative who is now a deputy White House chief of staff, said of the two-state  visit, "We're not taking anything for granted."</p>
        <p>Other campaign aides noted that Mr. Clinton has been in New York often in recent years, but usually to raise money or campaign for other Democrats like Mr. Dinkins or Mario M. Cuomo, and had not had a plain old-fashioned political chat with local Democrats for some time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ferrer said the meeting with Hispanic officials, which also included the  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Henry Cisneros, lasted about two hours, and covered a range of topics, from welfare reform to politics.</p>
        <p>The event last night at Webster Hall -- a mecca for the hip and happening in  the East Village where Madonna once paraded in her pajamas to promote her album  "Bedtime Stories" -- was intended to appeal to younger supporters, who paid $150 to $250 to eat garlic shrimp, listen to a jazz band and cheer Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>A saxophone was propped up onstage in case Mr. Clinton decided to reprise his musical performance from the Arsenio Hall show, but the President settled for a  lot of hand-shaking and a call for younger voters to make their voices heard.</p>
        <p>"This election is about you and your future," he said. "It's about what kind  of America you're going to live in."</p>
        <p>The scenic highlight of Mr. Clinton's visit came earlier in the day, when his motorcade decended from the heights of Union City into the Lincoln Tunnel. The route he used was by far the most direct into Manhattan, but a great rarity for  Presidents, because the Secret Service and New York City police much prefer the  isolated security of helicopters and the solitary splendor of the East River Drive. In this case, that method would have meant an hour-long trek through Newark International Airport to the Wall Street heliport.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Clinton was in his suite at the Sheraton New York in midtown within 15 minutes of leaving Union City, after a triumphal progression along West 42d Street and up the Avenue of the Americas to West 53d Street, as midday  passersby milled behind block after block of blue-and-white police sawhorses. On 42d Street, the motorcade passed the cleaned up marquees of the former pornographic theaters that once lined the block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues.</p>
        <p>"It's been sort of v-chipped!" Mr. Ickes marveled of the street, referring to the device that can be installed in television sets to block violent programming and that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore support.</p>
