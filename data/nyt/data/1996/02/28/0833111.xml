Some of the  themes he gave the strings were able to sing in a way that they cannot in the piano version. Ives's provocative juxtapositions had a new vitality as well.</p>

        <p>The debate about Charles Ives still rages in some circles, but generally speaking, those who consider this crusty old New Englander an amateur whom posterity has perversely canonized have been outvoted by those who consider him  a great American original. The American Composers Orchestra and its music director, Dennis Russell Davies, presumably subscribe to the prevailing view, but at Carnegie Hall on Sunday afternoon, they provided ample fodder for both sides of the argument.</p>
        <p>The occasion was the American premiere of Henry Brant's orchestration of the  "Concord" Sonata, a sprawling piano work built around quirky Ivesian portraits of Emerson, Hawthorne, the Alcotts and Thoreau. Mr. Brant, who conducted the performance, has used the orchestra imaginatively in his expansion. Some of the  themes he gave the strings were able to sing in a way that they cannot in the piano version. Ives's provocative juxtapositions had a new vitality as well.</p>
        <p>The "Emerson" movement, for example, includes a gorgeous chor alelike section (heard here in a string arrangement worthy of Vaughan Williams) followed immediately by a circus band, yet another effect that emerged far more vividly in the orchestration than in the piano version. The orchestration was also best  in sections where Ives wanted harmonic cloudiness; and of course, percussion, which Mr. Brant used for emphasis and color, was at best a vague implication in  the piano score.</p>
        <p>Yet there was something lost in translation. As a piano work, the "Concord" had a tautness, a sharp edge that was dulled slightly. In a way -- particularly  in the concluding "Thoreau" movement -- Mr. Brant's expansion gave the music a weight and density that left it sounding more ponderous than philosophical.</p>
        <p>The orchestra gave the music an enthusiastic performance, but in the end it may itself have succumbed to the tedium of the final movement. The players responded with more consistent vigor to one of Mr. Brant's own works, the world  premiere of his "Plowshares and Swords," conducted by Mr. Davies. Like many of Mr. Brant's pieces, this is a spatial score, meaning that players were arrayed in groups across the stage and in the balconies to take advantage of Carnegie Hall's acoustics and physical configuration.</p>
        <p>One would think that the effect would not be all that novel in this age of surround-sound movie theaters, but it was hard not to look around as the flutes  played a swirling figure on one side of the hall, responding to the strings and  percussion on the stage and the trombones opposite them and the lower brass to the rear. Nor was the work's charm entirely in effects: Mr. Brant gave his players some appealing themes, some of which would have probably seemed more striking if the orchestra was not so widely scattered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davies opened the concert with a sweetly polished performance of the "Elegy for Strings" from Morton Gould's "Holocaust" Suite, in memory of the composer, who died on Feb. 21, and a rugged account of Roger Sessions' Fifth Symphony.</p>
