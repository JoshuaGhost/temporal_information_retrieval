        <p>Three and a half years ago, shortly after Lynda M. Arnold had begun her afternoon nursing shift in the intensive-care unit at Community Hospital in Lancaster, Pa., she was told to put an intravenous line into a patient's arm.</p>
        <p>"As I was removing the catheter needle from the patient's vein, the patient suddenly moved his arm," Mrs. Arnold said last week in a telephone interview. "That movement forced the needle into my palm. When I took off my gloves to wash my hands, I realized that not only was I stuck, but I was also bleeding."</p>

        <p>Three and a half years ago, shortly after Lynda M. Arnold had begun her afternoon nursing shift in the intensive-care unit at Community Hospital in Lancaster, Pa., she was told to put an intravenous line into a patient's arm.</p>
        <p>"As I was removing the catheter needle from the patient's vein, the patient suddenly moved his arm," Mrs. Arnold said last week in a telephone interview. "That movement forced the needle into my palm. When I took off my gloves to wash my hands, I realized that not only was I stuck, but I was also bleeding."</p>
        <p>Mrs. Arnold was four months out of nursing school when she was injured. Within six months, blood tests showed that she had been infected with the human  immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS.</p>
        <p>"When I heard the results," she said, "I was in such a state of shock that I  could think of nothing else but, 'Am I going to die? What about my fiancee? Is he going to leave me? Are people going to hate me? Am I going to lose my job?' It was real basic stuff that I feared."</p>
        <p>Today, Mrs. Arnold intends to announce, in a gathering at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia, a national campaign to obtain written commitments from hospitals to adopt safer needle systems, systems that were available at the time of her injury. She and her associates plan to publish periodically the names of  hospitals and other health care organizations that sign on the campaign, as well as those that refuse.</p>
        <p>While she and her associates do not plan to endorse specific products, Mrs. Arnold said, hospitals can chose among dozens of safer needle systems at "little or no increase in total costs."</p>
        <p>Dr. Janine Jagger, an associate professor of neurosurgery at the University of Virginia who is also the director of the International Health Care Worker Safety Research and Resource Center there, said use of passive devices like self-sheathing blood-drawing needles would prevent "at least 80 percent of all transmissions of bloodborne pathogens to the nation's health care workers."</p>
        <p>Large-bore needles like the ones used at blood drives pose the greatest danger to health care workers, Dr. Jagger said, adding that the fine needles used for giving injections were unlikely to transmit the virus.</p>
        <p>Some 800,000 needle-stick injuries occur each year in the United States, and  46 cases of job-related H.I.V. transmission in health care workers have been documented up to July 1995, when the most recent data were compiled for the quarterly H.I.V./ AIDS Surveillance Report put out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Ninety-seven other health-care workers are known to have contracted the virus, but their infections have not been conclusively linked to their jobs. Other diseases like hepatitis can also be transmitted by needle accidents.</p>
        <p>"One of the objectives of the surveillance program is to go out and actually  try to document the circumstances of the injury so that we can reduce the risk of future occurrences," said Dr. John W. Ward, who oversees the H.I.V./AIDS surveillance division for the centers.</p>
        <p>State and local agencies who track AIDS among current and former health care  workers have not been given extra money for H.I.V.-infection surveillance programs, Dr. Ward said, and therefore "we feel that this represents a minimum estimate of people who may have been infected in the health care setting."</p>
        <p>Dr. Ward cautioned that the increase in numbers may not represent a trend toward reduced worker safety, but rather may just as easily reflect better reporting of H.I.V. infections in recent years. And he pointed out that AIDS cases in the general population had roughly doubled in the same period.</p>
        <p>In addition to Dr. Jagger's center, other organizations supporting Mrs. Arnold's effort include the American Nurses Association; the National Phlebotomists Association; the Service Employees International Union; the Association of Operating Room Nurses, and the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association.</p>
