        <p>For Kelli Peterson, a 17-year-old senior at East High School here, the Aztec  and U.F.O. clubs held no appeal; her primary concern was intensely personal -- easing the loneliness she felt as a gay student.</p>
        <p>"I thought I was the only lesbian student in East High," she said outside school here today. "As a sophomore I was really pressured by my friends to date. I came out that year, and immediately lost all my friends. I watched the same cycle of denial, trying to hide, acceptance, then your friends abandoning you."</p>

        <p>For Kelli Peterson, a 17-year-old senior at East High School here, the Aztec  and U.F.O. clubs held no appeal; her primary concern was intensely personal -- easing the loneliness she felt as a gay student.</p>
        <p>"I thought I was the only lesbian student in East High," she said outside school here today. "As a sophomore I was really pressured by my friends to date. I came out that year, and immediately lost all my friends. I watched the same cycle of denial, trying to hide, acceptance, then your friends abandoning you."</p>
        <p>So last fall, she and two other gay students formed an extracurricular club  called the Gay/Straight Alliance. With that, the three set off a furor that now  involves national conservative leaders, the State Legislature and the local school board.</p>
        <p>Anti-gay leaders believe that a strong stand in Utah will help turn the national tide against gay clubs in high schools, which have sprung up in the last decade from Boston and New York to San Francisco and Los Angeles. They point to Utah's precedent-setting legislation last year that formally banned same-sex marriages. Although Utah is politically more conservative than most states, this year, 15 other state legislatures are debating similar bans.</p>
        <p>"We are going to win this battle -- and Utah will again be in the forefront," said Gayle Ruzicka, president of the Utah Eagle Forum, an affiliate of Phyllis Schlafly's national organization. "Homosexuals can't reproduce, so they recruit. And they are not going to use Utah high school and junior high school campuses to recruit."</p>
        <p>Ms. Peterson scoffs at the idea: "Nobody led me to become a lesbian. My parents are heterosexual. I was taught to be heterosexual. I was taught to get married and to have children."</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, 12-year-old conservative-sponsored Federal legislation would have forced the district to allow Ms. Peterson's club to meet in the school. The law, the Federal Equal Access Act of 1984, was intended to allow Bible clubs to  meet in schools. Sponsored by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the law says local school boards cannot pick among campus clubs. Last week, Mr. Hatch, a Republican, fumed. "The act was never intended to promulgate immoral speech or activity," he said.</p>
        <p>Fearing lawsuits -- and loss of Federal aid -- Salt Lake City's Board of Education chose last week to ban all clubs from city high schools, from the Polynesian Club to Students Against Drunk Driving.</p>
        <p>In response, hundreds of students poured out of city high schools last Friday, marching on the State Capitol. In the protest, one 14-year-old girl was  run over by a car and critically injured.</p>
        <p>Last month, as anti-gay feelings started to crystallize, Utah's Senate violated the state's public meetings law and met in secret to watch an anti-gay  video. Senators later said they were so shocked that they would vote to ban gay  clubs in schools, even if it meant risking $100 million a year in Federal aid to Utah schools.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Senate easily approved a bill forbidding teachers from "encouraging, condoning or supporting illegal conduct." An amendment to preach "tolerance" was defeated. With sodomy a misdemeanor in Utah, the bill's sponsor  said the measure was aimed at keeping avowed homosexuals out of public schools.</p>
        <p>"Young people reach their teen-age years, and their sexuality starts developing," said State Senator Craig Taylor, the sponsor. "And I believe they can be led down that road to homosexuality."</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, a political group, Gay Lesbian Utah Democrats, pressured  Democratic legislators to try to legalize sodomy. In response, the state's party leadership demanded that the group drop "Democrats" from its name.</p>
        <p>With battle lines drawn sharply, both sides believe that a struggle of national importance is being fought in this desert state of two million people. Defenders of gay high school clubs say that Utah's opponents are fighting a doomed battle. Nationwide, the number of high school gay clubs have mushroomed from a handful in 1992 to hundreds today, according to the Gay Lesbian Straight Teachers Network, a group based in New York.</p>
        <p>Today, a member of this group, Clayton K. Vetter, became the first Utah public school teacher to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vetter, a debate teacher, said gay issues were everywhere. "The best way  to deal with them is through openness," he said, before holding a news conference at the State Capitol. Under the "illegal conduct" bill that is expected to be passed this week by Utah's House of Representatives, Mr. Vetter risks dismissal.</p>
        <p>In Salt Lake City, the population is roughly evenly divided between Mormons and non-Mormons. In 1991, Mormon church leaders issued a statement condemning homosexuality, saying, "Such thoughts and feelings, regardless of their causes,  can and should be overcome and sinful behavior should be eliminated."</p>
        <p>At last week's school board meeting, protesters held up signs reading "Down with homophobic clergy." Calling homosexuality an "abomination," The Deseret News, which is owned by the Mormon Church, said that a ban on high school gay groups reflected community "values that have long viewed homosexual practices as a serious problem to be combatted, rather than merely pitied or tolerated, let alone abetted."</p>
        <p>In retort, The Salt Lake Tribune, Utah's largest-selling newspaper called the campus ban "small-minded, uncharitable and cruel."</p>
        <p>Ms. Peterson, who is herself Mormon, says she is taking steps to formally leave the church.</p>
        <p>But even in Salt Lake City, some gay activists say that tolerance is inexorably spreading. "I am seeing more and more public support for what the students are doing," said Charlene Orchard, a lesbian who last month founded a support group here for the high school students, the Citizen's Alliance for Hate-Free Schools.</p>
        <p>At East High, a neo-Gothic structure that disgorged student protesters last Friday, the divisions of Utah's larger society are mirrored among the 1,400 students.</p>
        <p>Last week, several students asked the principal for permission to form a club called "the Anti-Homosexual League." Then, at last Friday's walkout, some boys threw snowballs at their protesting classmates.</p>
        <p>"I'd rather do away with all the clubs, than have that club," Joseph Emerson, a high school senior, said Monday in the warmth of his pickup truck in the school parking lot.</p>
        <p>"It's against our religion," the senior, a Mormon, said as two friends nodded assent. "Ban homosexuality, not clubs -- we should have a demonstration like that."</p>
        <p>Students like Ms. Peterson say that it was precisely these sentiments that led them to form the Gay/Straight Alliance last fall. Erin Wiser, a 17-year-old  lesbian, said, "When my girlfriends would talk about marriage or boys, I would feel isolated."</p>
        <p>A 16-year-old bisexual girl who asked not to be identified said that the alliance had sought a low profile, meeting quietly in classrooms, coffee houses  or family living rooms.</p>
        <p>"All we asked for is classroom time," said the girl, a junior. "We never used the intercom at student announcement time. We didn't ask for a picture in the yearbook."</p>
        <p>Denying accusations that they were forming a "sex club," Ms. Peterson said the alliance is not about "technique," but about "identity."</p>
        <p>Kelli's mother, Dee Peterson, recalled Kelli's hospitalization for depression last year after realizing her orientation. "Being gay you don't have a choice,"  Mrs. Peterson said. "You either are or you aren't."</p>
        <p>While state officials may succeed in keeping homosexuality out of the state sphere, gay high school students vow to keep meeting, either on campus in school hallways or off-campus in coffeehouses.</p>
        <p>And on graduation, they will find a full-fledged gay community that has grown in recent years in this city of half a million people.</p>
        <p>Last June, about 5,000 people attended Salt Lake City's annual gay pride march. Every month, The Pillar, a gay tabloid carries advertisements for gay bars and gay personals. A full page of "Support and Social Groups" includes gay bowling and volleyball teams, a gay square dancing club, and such groups as  the Rocky Mountain Cruisers and the Utah Gay Rodeo Association.</p>
