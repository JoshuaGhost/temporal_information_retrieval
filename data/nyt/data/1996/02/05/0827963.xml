        <p>If not for a few campaign banners and a box of blue "Forbes for President" buttons, it would have been hard to tell whether it was a campaign rally or halftime at a high school basketball game.</p>
        <p>But there were elements of both today when Steve Forbes returned to his home  county to receive the endorsement of local Republicans. Between 200 and 300 people, many casually dressed families with small children, crowded into the Somerset County Administration Building to see Mr. Forbes's first political rally in New Jersey.</p>

        <p>If not for a few campaign banners and a box of blue "Forbes for President" buttons, it would have been hard to tell whether it was a campaign rally or halftime at a high school basketball game.</p>
        <p>But there were elements of both today when Steve Forbes returned to his home  county to receive the endorsement of local Republicans. Between 200 and 300 people, many casually dressed families with small children, crowded into the Somerset County Administration Building to see Mr. Forbes's first political rally in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Although the Forbes family has been well known here for years, Mr. Forbes's  surge in the polls has brought him increased notice.</p>
        <p>"I like his tax proposal," said Art Tropiano, 80, who owns a jewelry store. "He's a young guy, 48 years old. The big issue about Dole is his age. The thing  is that the President can't do that much in one term, so he has got to be young  enough to serve two."</p>
        <p>The crowd cheered and flapped blue cardboard "Forbes for President" banners when the candidate entered. Meg Florio, 7, daughter of the county Republican chairman, presented Forbes with a small Somerset County commemorative pin in the shape of a balloon. "I promised to be here today so when the reporters ask you what I was like when I was a wee bit smaller, you will say nice things," Mr. Forbes told the crowd.</p>
        <p>The crowd responded to Mr. Forbes's call for lower taxes and less government, applauding his repeated criticism of "our friends from Washington."</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes's insistence that economic issues should be the heart of this year's campaign drew the most support.</p>
        <p>Tom Kotarsky, a draftsman who was laid off after 27 years with the Unisys Corporation, agreed.</p>
        <p>"I hear President Clinton saying there are eight million new jobs, but I don't see the jobs they are talking about," said Mr. Kotarsky, who described himself as a lifelong Republican rather than a Forbes supporter. "What we need is for industry to put people to work. Let's see the statistics on how they will do that."</p>
