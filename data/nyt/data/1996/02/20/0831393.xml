        <p>One financial institution is changing agencies and a second has placed its account in review.</p>
        <p>The Fleet Financial Group in Boston named Clarion Direct in Greenwich, Conn., to handle the consolidated direct marketing account of its Fleet Bank division,  with billings estimated at $25 million. The account had previously been divided among more than 10 agencies; Clarion Direct was not among them. The decision came after a three-month review that began with 16 agencies and was narrowed to Clarion Direct, which is a division of the Clarion Marketing and Communications unit of D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, and 2 other finalists: Barry Blau &amp; Partners in Westport, Conn., and Epsilon in Boston. Pile &amp; Company  in Boston managed the review.</p>

        <p>And Duffy &amp; Shanley Inc. in Providence, R.I., said that after nine years it  had resigned the account of the Citizens Bank in Providence, with billings estimated at $6 million to $7 million. As a result, Citizens, which is owned by  the Royal Bank of Scotland, has begun an informal closed review on the account.</p>
        <p>The account was "so labor intensive" that it "proved to be uneconomical for us," said David A. Duffy, president at Duffy &amp; Shanley, adding that the parting  was amicable. Hal Tovin, executive vice president and marketing director at Citizens, said he would talk to a "select number of agencies, primarily in New England." A decision is expected within 90 days, he added.</p>
