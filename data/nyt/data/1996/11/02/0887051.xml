        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>We were surprised to read Christopher Murray's suggestion (letter, Oct. 29) that Leonardo da Vinci used a mirror to write.</p>
        <p>Now on display as part of an exhibition we helped to arrange, ''The Art of Anatomy,'' in the Augustus C. Long Health Sciences Library of Columbia University, is a volume of Kenneth D. Keele and Carlos Pedretti's ''Corpus of the Anatomical Studies of Leonardo da Vinci,'' which says: ''Leonardo was left-handed and followed the natural impulse of writing backwards in a mirror script. This may have made the reading of his notes difficult to an untrained eye, but it was certainly not intended to make it impossible.''</p>

        <p>According to an early expert on this phenomenon, MacDonald Critchley, mirror-writing is a term that simply describes a script that ''runs in the opposite direction to the normal, the individual letters being also reversed. The writing is therefore illegible until held up before a looking glass.''</p>
