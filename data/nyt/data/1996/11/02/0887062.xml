        <p>A rare Korean dragon jar from the 17th century, cracked down one side, was sold on Thursday night for $8.6 million at Christie's in New York. The price was the highest ever paid at auction for an Asian art object. The names of the seller and the buyer, who bid by telephone, were not disclosed.</p>
        <p>The jar is boldly emblazoned with a fierce, three-clawed dragon, a brown-black iron oxide monster depicted as chasing the pearl of wisdom around the baluster-shaped jar. At nearly 19 inches, it is the tallest known of this type of ceramic vessel.</p>
        <p>TXT&gt;</p>
        <p>''Forget about it being cracked,'' said Leighton Longhi, a New York dealer in Asian art. ''That piece has everything going for it. It has enormous size, beautiful proportions and great painting. The dragon is a boldly drawn image in iron oxide, not the more usual blue and white. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''</p>
        <p>The previous record price for Asian art was $6.1 million, for a Tang horse sold in 1989 at Sotheby's in London.</p>
        <p>Sebastian Izzard, the head of Christie's department of Korean and Japanese art, said he had not known that the dragon jar existed until it was shown to him in 1995. ''It had been in storage probably for 50 years,'' he said. ''It is the largest version known of a type produced in the Choson Dynasty in the early 17th century. The four or five others are all in museums.''</p>
        <p>Even so, he made a conservative estimate, at $400,000 to $600,000, because the jar had a crack running down the side and a firing crack in the base.</p>
        <p>Similar but much smaller pieces are in the National Museum of Korea in Seoul as well as in two other museums in South Korea, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the Ataka Collection in Osaka, Japan.</p>
        <p>''Korean industrialists and museums have bought virtually all the important pieces of Korean art sold recently,'' Mr. Longhi said. ''This one most likely is also going back to Korea.''</p>
        <p>Prices for Korean art began to increase rapidly in the late 1980's, as the economy in South Korea improved. The pace quickened in 1992 when Korean ceramics from the Ataka Collection in Japan were exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And prices have continued to rise since the Metropolitan announced a year ago that its Arts of Korea Galleries would open in late 1997.</p>
