        <p>FBI withdraws team of agents sent to investigate June bombing that killed 19 American airmen in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, citing lack of cooperation from Saudi security officials, who fear exposing the extent of their kingdom's internal divisions and allegedly intend to blame the bombing on forces beyond their borders; cooperation was not good from the beginning and deteriorated further in recent days after reports that Saudis had arrested and interrogated dozens of suspects and had decided who was responsible but had not told the FBI or shared information on how they had reached their conclusions; several senior American officials are highly skeptical of Saudis' investigation; photo (M)</p>

        <p>Federal authorities said today that the F.B.I. Director, Louis J. Freeh, exasperated by the lack of cooperation from Saudi security officials, had pulled out a team of agents sent to investigate the bombing in June that killed 19 American airmen at their military housing in Dhahran.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's decision, which appeared to be a threat to end American involvement in the investigation, reflected the serious strains in an unwieldy relationship that F.B.I. officials had once portrayed as a partnership with Saudi security forces to determine who was behind the powerful blast at Al Khobar Towers.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Federal authorities said today that the F.B.I. Director, Louis J. Freeh, exasperated by the lack of cooperation from Saudi security officials, had pulled out a team of agents sent to investigate the bombing in June that killed 19 American airmen at their military housing in Dhahran.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's decision, which appeared to be a threat to end American involvement in the investigation, reflected the serious strains in an unwieldy relationship that F.B.I. officials had once portrayed as a partnership with Saudi security forces to determine who was behind the powerful blast at Al Khobar Towers.</p>
        <p>American authorities said the Saudis feared exposing the extent of their kingdom's internal divisions and have been traditionally reluctant to involve outsiders in sovereign matters. The officials also suspect that the Saudis are intent on blaming the bombing on forces beyond their borders, even if evidence of such outside sponsorship is inconclusive.</p>
        <p>American officials said shortly after the bombing that the Saudis had pledged their full cooperation. Defense Secretary William J. Perry said then that King Fahd had pledged ''complete cooperation,'' including allowing Federal agents to interview suspects detained by the Saudis. Mr. Perry said the King was ''quite clear there would be full cooperation, full sharing of information.''</p>
        <p>But from the start Saudi officials had routinely withheld information from their counterparts at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, officials said. The relationship deteriorated further in recent days after reports that the Saudis had arrested and interrogated dozens of suspects and had decided who was responsible, but had not told the F.B.I. or shared information on how they had reached their conclusions.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Perry seemed to express the changed atmosphere and impatience within the Administration, saying the Saudis must cooperate fully with the United States.</p>
        <p>''In my discussions with the senior Saudi officials, I have made very clear the importance to our defense departments of full cooperation in this investigation,'' he said. ''They have promised us at the highest levels of the Saudi Government full cooperation. Any further comments on that would have to come from the F.B.I.''</p>
        <p>More broadly, Mr. Perry said American officials had not determined who was behind the plot. ''We have reached no conclusions about who was responsible for this,'' he told reporters, in response to a report today in The Washington Post that Saudi authorities had concluded that as many as 40 Saudi conspirators -- supported by Iran -- were to blame.</p>
        <p>But several senior American officials said they were highly skeptical of the Saudis' investigation. One official, who like others spoke only on condition of anonymity, insisted the investigation was not complete and raised doubts about the Saudis' conclusion that there was an international connection to the bombing.</p>
        <p>''We've reached no conclusions and the Saudis have conveyed no conclusion to us,'' the official said. ''It's premature. It's simply not true to say we have the answers.''</p>
        <p>The official said the investigation had focused on theories ''splattering'' in many directions, adding: ''You're dealing with a netherworld. On one level everyone's connected to everyone. But you need a lot more than connections. You need evidence.''</p>
        <p>Just after the explosion, Mr. Freeh sent more than 70 agents to the scene to help examine evidence and investigate suspects. Since then, the number of agents has gradually dwindled to fewer than a dozen.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said today that replacement agents who were to have been sent to Saudi Arabia early this week were ordered to remain in their regular assignments, and that agents on site who had already been moved to Riyadh, the capital, had been reassigned.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities had hoped for greater cooperation from the Saudi Government after complaining bitterly about being excluded from the investigation of a bombing in Riyadh on Nov. 13, 1995, in which five Americans and two Indians were killed.</p>
        <p>In that case, F.B.I. agents were refused access to four suspects before they were beheaded in May for their roles. Since the Dhahran bombing, Mr. Freeh had made two trips to persuade Saudi officials to cooperate, but his entreaties, as part of an broader thrust to expand the F.B.I. counterterrorism efforts abroad, appeared to have little impact.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the Saudis seem to have concluded that the investigation has reached a final stage, officials said. A Western diplomat said American officials had ''learned a great deal'' about efforts earlier in the year to smuggle explosives and other bomb material into Saudi Arabia from Jordan, which would indicate that the bombers had support from outside Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>The diplomat indicated that both American and Saudi officials believed that a car intercepted last March that was driven by a Saudi Shiite Muslim and carried explosives obtained in southern Lebanon had been part of a wider operation linked to the Al Khobar bombing. The Saudi authorities announced the interception in April, describing a find that included explosives, lengths of fuse and other bomb-making equipment.</p>
        <p>Western diplomats also said American and Saudi officials suspected that several outside organizations might be involved in the Dhahran bombing, including Hezbollah, the Shiite Muslim group supported by Iran and Syria; terrorist organizations abroad, and possibly Saudi Sunni Muslim groups allied with those who are thought to have carried out the Riyadh attack.</p>
        <p>But the diplomats said Western governments had not seen enough information to be able to conclude whether Iran or Syrian officials or organizations they support had played roles in the Dhahran operation.</p>
        <p>One Saudi with knowledge of the investigation said he had been told that American investigators would not be allowed to interrogate any suspects in the bombing. The Saudi said the issue was a concern over sovereignty, despite Federal statutes that give the F.B.I. a role in investigating terrorist attacks on American citizens overseas.</p>
        <p>The Saudi, who said he had been briefed by those playing a central role in the investigation, said Saudi authorities had promised their American counterparts only that they would be given advance warning of any public confession or execution. Such a warning was described by the Saudi as an attempt to make good on promises of better cooperation than occurred in the investigation into the bombing in Riyadh.</p>
