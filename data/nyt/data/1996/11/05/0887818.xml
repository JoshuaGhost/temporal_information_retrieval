        <p>It is hard for Garry Kasparov's opponents to figure out what to play against him. Even after he wins, if he has played something doubtful he will work with great energy to find improvements.</p>
        <p>So it does little good to fasten your attention on his past shortcomings. But what does that leave? Perhaps trying some opening that he has never faced and never formed a judgment about.</p>
        <p>But Zbigniew Hracek tried to exploit a weakness in Kasparov's previous play when they met in the 32d Olympiad in Yerevan, Armenia. And their seventh-round game, in the match between the Czech Republic and Russia, was once again a disappointment for a Kasparov opponent. Hracek did not get a second look at what he expected.</p>
        <p>In a main line of the Richter-Rauzer Attack against the Sicilian Defense, the sharp counterthrust, 10  . . . b5, was introduced in 1995 by Konstantin Aseyev. It quickly caught Vladimir Kramnik's eye and he used it against Kasparov in Amsterdam in April. Though Kasparov won, Hracek was not impressed by his 11 Bf6 gf 12 Bd3 Qc7 13 Qe3 Qc5 14 Qg3 and happily anticipated that again, with his own improvements. Unfortunately for him, it was the champion who came armed with a novelty.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the positional gambit occasionally ventured in similar situations with the recapture, 11 . . . Bf6?, would have been hit by 12 e5 de 13 Qc5! Bd7 14 Nb5! Be7 (or 14 . . . ab? 15 Rd7! Qd7 16 Bb5, winning easily) Be7 15 Nc7 Kf8 16 Qe5, as Kasparov noted. White will immediately win another pawn with the initiative.</p>
        <p>After 11 . . . gf, the positional sacrifice with 12 f5 has been tried a few times and revealed to have little punch. But now Kasparov unveils his new, aggressive thrust, 12 e5!?, to break open lines for attack. If 12 . . . de, there could come 13 Qe4 Bd7 14 Bb5! ab 15 Rd7 Kd7 16 Rd1 Bd6 17 Nb5 Ke7 18 Nd6 Qb8 19 fe Ra2 20 ef Kf8 21 Nb7 Ra1 22 Kd2 Rd1 23 Kd1 h5 24 Qb4 Kg8 25 Qe7 Qf8 26 Ke2 Rh6 27 Nd6 Rg6 28 g3 Rg4 29 c3 Ra4 30 Ke3 Ra1 31 b4 Rd1 32 Qf8 Kf8 33 Ne4, with a winning endgame for White.</p>
        <p>In playing 13 . . . b4, Hracek was not having grand dreams of queenside counterattacking chances, but despairing of a quiet development like 13 . . . Bd7, which would have done nothing to discourage 14 f5! Forced out of its usual queenside post, Kasparov's knight came wheeling around to attack on the other wing with 16 Nh5.</p>
        <p>After 16 . . . Rb8, Hracek was hoping to develop with 17 . . . Qb6, but Kasparov at once revved up his attack with 17 g4! fg 18 f5! He dared Hracek to seize another pawn with 18  . . . ef, when 19 e6! Rg8 (not 19 . . . Rf8? 20 Ng7 mate) 20 ef Kf7 21 Bg2 Be6 (or 21 . . . Bb7 22 Qe5) 22 Nf4 Bf6 23 Ne6! and Black either drops a piece with 23 . . . Bd4 24 Nd8 Rgd8 25 Rd4 or goes down in a hail of fire after 23 . . . Ke6 24 Bd5.</p>
        <p>Hracek could not ignore 19 Nf6 because 19 . . . Kf8 20 Ng8 Kg8 21 f6 Bf8 22 Qg4 Kh8 23 Qh5 Bc5 24 Bd3 Qg8 25 Rd2 Bd7 26 Rg2 forces mate.</p>
        <p>After 21 Bg2, Hracek found himself in a terrible predicament. Maybe 21 . . . Rb6!?, to cut the black queen off from a7 and to reinforce the third rank, was a defense worth considering. If that were to hold up, he might sneak his king out of the center with  . . . Kd8 and . . . Kc7.</p>
        <p>On 21 . . . Rg5?, Kasparov crashed through with 22 Bd5! Then 22 . . . ed is defeated by 23 Qe3, while 22 . . . Qd5 loses to 23 Qf4 and 22 . . . Rf5 folds up against 23 Bc6! Qc6 24 Qd8 mate. Moreover, 22 . . . Bb7 23 Bb7 Qd4 24 Bc6 Kf8 25 Rd4 puts Black a piece down in the endgame.</p>
        <p>So Hracek tried 22 . . . Bd7, but after 23 Rhe1 h6 24 fe, he could not well play 24 . . . Be6 because of 25 Qa7! Rd5 26 Rd5 Qd5 27 Qe7 mate. But his 24 . . . fe met with virtually the same stratagem: 25 Qa7! Seeing that 25 . . . Rd5 (25 . . . Qb6 26 Re6! is no better) 26 Rd5 Qd5 27 Qb8 Kf7 28 Qh8 would have been hopeless, Hracek gave up.</p>
