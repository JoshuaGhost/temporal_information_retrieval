        <p>President Clinton delivered ''the last speech of my last campaign'' early this morning after hopscotching buoyantly across America, remembering moments from campaigns past and calling on supporters to ''seize the day to keep your country moving in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>His voice growing hoarse as he carried his quest to retain the Presidency into a long final night, Mr. Clinton asked crowd after crowd at his rallies to look at his record, to remember the Republican-driven shutdowns of the Government last year -- and to come to the polls.</p>
        <p>Four years ago, Mr. Clinton said, voters had taken a chance on him. Now, he said they could judge what he had done and compare him with the Republicans.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to take me on faith anymore,'' he said. ''You don't have to say, 'Well that sounds like a good approach.' We tried our approach and they have fought it every step of the way and you know which one works.''</p>
        <p>Showing confidence of a victory tonight that would make Mr. Clinton the first Democratic President since Franklin D. Roosevelt to serve a full term and then win re-election, the crowds of aides, supporters and reporters with Mr. Clinton kept growing through the final days. By the time he got to Cleveland on Monday and was joined by his wife, Hillary, and Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Gore's wife, Tipper, his motorcade had grown to 47 cars, including four busloads of journalists.</p>
        <p>At midday, the Clintons and Gores appeared together as they first had in 1992, this time under a banner proclaiming ''Cleveland, Ohio Rocks with Clinton Gore '96.''</p>
        <p>A revved-up Mr. Gore warmed up the crowd for his running mate in the jam-packed convocation center of Cleveland State University, speaking at warp speed, which seemed double the measured pace of his debate against Jack Kemp last month.</p>
        <p>''I do not know what the Vice President ate for breakfast on Monday morning,'' Mr. Clinton said, ''but if he'd had two more bites of it, he would have blown the roof clear off this thing.''</p>
        <p>At times Mr. Clinton was nearly drowned out as the 10,000-strong crowd roared as if it were at a sporting event.</p>
        <p>Ever since he was 28 years old, Bill Clinton has been running for one office or another. But Monday was the last day of what he has been calling ''my last campaign'' or sometimes ''my last campaign unless I run for the school board someday.'' And the indefatigable campaigner was at times openly sentimental.</p>
        <p>He began Monday morning, on no more than four hours sleep, in New Hampshire, the nation's first primary state, where his run for the Presidency almost died four years ago in a torrent of questions about his draft record and marital fidelity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, then Governor of Arkansas, fought back that winter of 1992, begging voter after voter in New Hampshire to give him a second chance. And they did, giving him a respectable second-place showing in the Democratic primary.</p>
        <p>Early Monday morning, the air frosty, the sky brilliant blue, Mr. Clinton gazed out at several hundred supporters in Manchester and told them, ''A couple of weeks ago we were trying to plan how we would end this campaign -- I hope I can say this without cracking up -- and I said I would like to begin the last day of my last campaign in New Hampshire.''</p>
        <p>He recalled his most notable New Hampshire speech. ''I said in Dover in 1992 if you would give me a chance to be President I would be with you until the last dog dies,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His enthusiasts shouted out the end of his sentence with him, having long ago memorized the distinctive turn of phrase. ''There's still a lot of life left in this old dog,'' Mr. Clinton said with a smile.</p>
        <p>Before he spoke, he ate breakfast with a small group of longtime supporters, joining them in the Merrimack Restaurant where John F. Kennedy began his Presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton gave a bear hug to Kris Durmer, who organized the first campaign event for him in Nashua in October of 1991.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's eyes became teary when he called out, ''How's it going buddy?'' to Michael Morrison, a 20-year-old with cerebral palsy. Not yet old enough to vote in 1992, Mr. Morrison drove his electric wheelchair a few miles down the road to work a polling site for the embattled candidate.</p>
        <p>''This time you won't have to ride that wheelchair all the way down the road,'' Mr. Clinton said, his electoral fortunes on the upturn and no longer in need of such acts of loyalty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton winged on in Air Force One across fields dusted with an early snow, with the last bursts of red autumn foliage, to Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa and on to South Dakota before a predawn return to Arkansas.</p>
        <p>By this evening in Iowa the President's daughter, Chelsea, had joined her parents on stage. The crowd greeted her with a chant of ''Chel-sea! Chel-sea! Chel-sea!'' As the night wore on, Mr. Clinton could not seem to stop talking, his speeches getting longer and longer.</p>
        <p>The President's strategists said that of the states on his itinerary only South Dakota would be a struggle to win. But seeking every edge to the last moment, Clinton aides gave reporters copies of an article in the current issue of The New Yorker quoting an unidentified adviser to Bob Dole as saying his candidate was ''heading for a very respectable loss.''</p>
        <p>But it was far less clear what would happen in the elections for Congress and Mr. Clinton's stops in Iowa and and South Dakota were designed to generate a burst of enthusiasm for embattled Democratic Senate candidates: Representative Tim Johnson in South Dakota and the Iowa incumbent Tom Harkin, who had also been one of the Presidential primary contenders in 1992.</p>
        <p>Time and again he told voters to remember how the Republican-led Congress waged the 1995 battle over the budget.</p>
        <p>''All over America, they're praying for amnesia,'' Mr. Clinton said of the Republicans. He compared their 1995 budget proposal to a mutt. ''I thought it was a mangy old dog,'' he said tonight in Iowa, ''and that's why I vetoed it.''  POLITICS: THE DEMOCRAT</p>
        <p>Correction:  April 5, 1997, Saturday</p>
        <p>An article in some copies on Nov. 5 about the mood in Arkansas on the night of the Presidential election referred incorrectly to the resignation of William Kennedy 3d as associate White House counsel. He resigned for personal reasons and was not removed. Mr. Kennedy alerted The Times to the error late in March after reading the article in an on-line database.</p>
