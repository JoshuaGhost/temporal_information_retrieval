        <p>Nearly three years after he left office, former Mayor David N. Dinkins was sharply questioned once again yesterday about his handling of the 1991 Crown Heights racial violence, as part of a lawsuit by Hasidic Jews who contend that Mr. Dinkins initially withheld police protection from Hasidic victims.</p>
        <p>It was the second time in the four-year-old lawsuit that Mr. Dinkins -- who has vehemently denied following any such policy -- was pressed on what he knew and when he knew it regarding the four-day outbreak in which bands of black youths rampaged through the Brooklyn neighborhood. The violence, in which a Hasidic man was stabbed to death, erupted after a car driven by another Hasidic man accidentally struck and killed a black child.</p>

        <p>Nearly three years after he left office, former Mayor David N. Dinkins was sharply questioned once again yesterday about his handling of the 1991 Crown Heights racial violence, as part of a lawsuit by Hasidic Jews who contend that Mr. Dinkins initially withheld police protection from Hasidic victims.</p>
        <p>It was the second time in the four-year-old lawsuit that Mr. Dinkins -- who has vehemently denied following any such policy -- was pressed on what he knew and when he knew it regarding the four-day outbreak in which bands of black youths rampaged through the Brooklyn neighborhood. The violence, in which a Hasidic man was stabbed to death, erupted after a car driven by another Hasidic man accidentally struck and killed a black child.</p>
        <p>And while yesterday's daylong encounter between Mr. Dinkins and the lawyer for the Hasidim was less acrimonious than their two-day face-off in Mr. Dinkins's first deposition -- at the height of his unsuccessful 1993 campaign for re-election -- it was still tense and testy.</p>
        <p>''My recollection is that earlier today I was asked the same damn question!'' the former Mayor, 69, exclaimed as the lawyer, Franklyn H. Snitow, pressed him, with both men hunched forward across a small table in the Park Avenue offices of Mr. Dinkins's lawyers.</p>
        <p>While one of his lawyers, John Harris, repeatedly insisted that Mr. Snitow was going over ground already covered in the questioning in  the 1993 deposition, Mr. Snitow maintained that he was not, and that yesterday's questions were needed because they took into account what police officials and others had said in subsequent depositions.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dinkins, speaking later to reporters, rejected this explanation and charged that his being brought back now for yet another grilling was ''unquestionably politically motivated,'' and related to the coming campaign in which the man who defeated him, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, is expected to seek re-election.</p>
        <p>''The timing is political'' because it is ''on the eve'' of Mr. Giuliani's re-election campaign, he contended, noting that his first deposition came  ''in the middle'' of his race against Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani denounced Mr. Dinkins's handling of the Crown Heights outbreak during the 1993 campaign.  Mr. Snitow yesterday called Mr. Dinkins's allegation that the questioning was politically motivated ''an outrage.'' The Dinkins deposition is to be completed tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Snitow hammered away at two topics yesterday. One was the Dinkins administration's handling of an emotionally charged 1990 boycott by blacks of a Korean grocery in Flatbush, Brooklyn, after a black woman complained of being assaulted by its employees. Mr. Snitow's questioning indicated that he was seeking to build a case that Mr. Dinkins had a pattern of failing to act against blacks engaged in ''racist conduct,'' a suggestion that clearly angered Mr. Dinkins.</p>
        <p>The second main topic was testimony from the deposition of a police commander at the Crown Heights violence scene that showed, Mr. Snitow said, that the commander had  ''made a decision not to make arrests for civil-disturbance crimes.'' Mr. Dinkins characterized the action  differently, saying that the commander ''asked his men to hold the line at a point as opposed to chasing down persons who were throwing rocks and bottles.''</p>
        <p>Norman Rosenbaum, the brother of Yankel Rosenbaum, the man who was fatally stabbed after the car accident that killed 7-year-old Gavin Cato, attended the deposition.</p>
