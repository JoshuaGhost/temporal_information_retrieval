      <abstract>
        <p>Voters in South Toms River, NJ, to vote on referendum that would change town's name to Cedar Pointe (New Jersey Daily Briefing) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The name South Toms River is fine as far as it goes, but some of the borough's 3,900 residents think they can do better: they want to change the town's name to Cedar Pointe.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, the name change will be put to a referendum. Dorothy Sullivan, who is leading the drive, said the largely blue-collar town would have a clearer identity -- and higher property values -- if it dissociated itself from Toms River. The new name comes from a neighborhood in the town, Cedar Point. Ms. Sullivan said the final ''e'' was added ''because we figured as long as we're going to change, we might as well put a little more class to it.''</p>

        <p>Mayor George Greitz Jr. and several Borough Council members oppose the switch, arguing that it would costs thousands of dollars to change the lettering on police cars, parking tickets and signs.</p>
