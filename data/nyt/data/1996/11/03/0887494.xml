        <p>''ALL I know is just what I read in the newspapers.'' Will Rogers's famous setup line could also have been, ''All I know is what I write in the newspapers.'' In 1922 the humorist, who became known as the ''Cowboy Philosopher'' while working in the Ziegfeld Follies, agreed to produce a weekly column for The New York Times and the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate that would echo his stage material. His first Sunday column appeared in The Times on Dec. 24. By the time of his death at 56 in a plane crash in 1935, Rogers's daily syndicated column and his special dispatches to The Times had 40 million readers -- a third of the American population.</p>
        <p>Rogers opined on everything from bootleggers to baseball, but (like a certain latter-day rich Texan) the Oklahoman saved his best digs for politics. Rogers always claimed that this was fate, since his birthday, Nov. 4, 1879, happened to be Election Day.</p>

        <p>Rogers opined on everything from bootleggers to baseball, but (like a certain latter-day rich Texan) the Oklahoman saved his best digs for politics. Rogers always claimed that this was fate, since his birthday, Nov. 4, 1879, happened to be Election Day.</p>
        <p>These newspaper writings, some from The Times and some from the syndicated columns, may have originally taken aim at Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover, but it does seem that the fellow who ''never met a man I didn't like'' might have had premonitions of candidates to come.</p>
        <p>ANNE CRONIN</p>
        <p>The reason I want to touch on the Senate today is that, as I am writing this, they are having what is called a filibuster. The name is just as silly as the thing itself. It means that a man can get up and talk for 15 or 20 hours at a time, then be relieved by another, just to keep some bill from coming to vote. . . . One Senator threatened to read the Bible into the record as part of his speech. And I guess he would have done it if somebody in the Capitol had had a Bible.</p>
        <p>March 4, 1923</p>
        <p>There is only one way to get even with  Harding now and that is to leave him in there another term. Besides, the Democrats come nearer getting what they want when they have a Republican President than they do with one of their own. They wanted this League of Nations thing and couldn't get it with their own gang. Now it looks like the Republicans are going to give it to them under an assumed name $(the World Court, which the Senate later rejected$) -- of course, it may just be for spite.</p>
        <p>Then the Democrats wanted the farm loans. Well, they got that. They didn't want the ship subsidy, so they didn't get that. So, personally, I think that it has been one of the best Democratic Administrations that the Republicans ever put on.</p>
        <p>March 18, 1923</p>
        <p>The income tax has made more liars out of the American people than golf has.</p>
        <p>April 8, 1923</p>
        <p>When I started on this job I was expected to write and tell America's secrets during the War. Well, as we had none, there was no demand from Washington to keep them. There's the one thing that no nation can ever accuse us of, and that is secret diplomacy. Our foreign dealings are an open book, generally a checkbook.</p>
        <p>Oct. 21, 1923</p>
        <p>Everything nowadays is a saying, or slogan. . . . Congress even has slogans: ''Why sleep at home when you can sleep in Congress?'' ''Be a politician -- no training necessary.'' ''It is easier to fool 'em in Washington than it is at home, so why not be a Senator?'' ''Come to Washington and vote to raise your own pay.'' . . .</p>
        <p>Even political campaigns are run and won on slogans. Years ago some fellow run on ''the Full Dinner Pail'' and after he was elected they opened it and there was nothing in it. . . .</p>
        <p>Some fool that didn't know American politics had J. W. Davis run on ''honesty.'' Well, that had no more place in politics than I have in the Harvard faculty. . . .</p>
        <p>Coolidge ran on ''economy,'' which is always good for the boobs. It's like getting up at a dinner and saying, ''I am proud to be here.'' It's an old gag but it always goes. Economy beat honesty by 8 million, and as soon as he got in he raised Congress' and the Senate's salary and redecorated the White House. So away goes another slogan!</p>
        <p>April 11, 1925</p>
        <p>I have a scheme for stopping war. It's this -- no nation is allowed to enter a war until they have paid for the last one.</p>
        <p>Aug. 29, 1928</p>
        <p>A lobbyist is a person that is supposed to help a politician to make up his mind, not only to help him but pay him.</p>
        <p>Aug. 24, 1929</p>
        <p>We are all in a lather over lobbying. If a man with no official connection can change a whole conference, it's not him you want to investigate; it's the ''buys'' that he influenced. If we have Senators and Congressmen that can't protect themselves against the evil temptations of lobbyists, we don't need to change our lobby, we need to change our representatives.</p>
        <p>Any person that can't spot a propagandist and lobbyist a mile away must be so blind that they still think toupees are deceptive and can't tell a hotel house detective from a guest.</p>
        <p>Sept. 29, 1929</p>
        <p>This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as we do when the baby gets hold of a hammer. It's just a question of how much damage he can do with it before we take it away from him.</p>
        <p>July 4, 1930</p>
        <p>Come pretty near to having two holidays of equal importance in the same week, Halloween and Election, and of the two Election provides us the most fun. On Halloween they put pumpkins on their heads, and on Election they don't have to.</p>
        <p>Nov. 2, 1930</p>
        <p>Mr. Hoover, the consolation you have from the whole American people is no doubt greater than that ever shared by a losing President. There was nothing personal in the vote against you. You just happened to be associated with a political party that the people had just ''lost their taste for.'' There is something about a Republican that you can only stand him for just so long. And on the other hand there is something about a Democrat that you can't stand him for quite that long.  Nov. 9, 1932</p>
        <p>There just seems to be something about running for President that you can never get out of a fellow's head. He never seems to figure his chances. It can be on an ''off year,'' or ''Leap Year'' and just nominate him, and he is perfectly tickled to death. That he will wind up just being a defeated candidate never seems to enter his head. That ''the time is not ripe for it'' is as foreign to his thoughts as the moon.</p>
        <p>Nov. 20, 1932</p>
        <p>I was born on Election Day, but never was able to get elected to anything. I am going to jump out some day and be indefinite enough about everything that they will call me a politician, then run on a platform of question marks, and be elected unanimously, then reach into the Treasury and bring back my district a new bridge, or tunnel, or dam, and I will be a statesman.</p>
        <p>March 11, 1933</p>
        <p>I generally give the party in power, whether Republican or Democratic, the more digs because they are generally doing the country the most damage, and besides, I don't think it's fair to jump too much on the fellow that is down. He is not working -- he is only living in hopes of getting back on the graft in another four years.</p>
        <p>May 14, 1933</p>
        <p>The phenomenal popularity of the Roosevelt Administration now meets its severest test. They are starting to decide where all this money they have been appropriating will come from. Now if he can extract this money and still receive plaudits, then there can be no doubt of his being a messiah. For taxpayers cheer not from the heart but from the pocketbook.</p>
