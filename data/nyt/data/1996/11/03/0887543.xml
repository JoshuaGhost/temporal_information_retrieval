        <p>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</p>
        <p>Second District Candidates</p>
        <p>EDWARD W. MUNSTER, 55, Republican. Retired statistician at Pfizer. Served one two-year term in the State Senate before challenging Mr. Gejdenson in 1992, a race he lost by 4,000 votes, and again in 1994, when he lost by only 21 votes.</p>
        <p>SAM GEJDENSON, 48, Democrat. Seeking his ninth term, the dean of the Connecticut delegation to the House. A former farmer from the rural community of Bozrah.</p>
        <p>The District</p>
        <p>The Second is the state's largest district geographically, covering most of eastern Connecticut. It has been in flux economically as military jobs have declined and as gambling and tourism have increased with the rise of the Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard and the recent opening of Mohegan Sun Resort in Montville.</p>
        <p>The Issues</p>
        <p>As in his previous campaigns, Mr. Munster has characterized his opponent as a liberal and ''career politician'' who has lost touch with his constituents. Mr. Gejdenson has criticized Mr. Munster for his alliance with Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House. Both candidates say they support welfare reform, abortion rights and Medicare, though Mr. Gejdenson says the Munster-supported Contract With America would have ''thrown elderly people out on the street.'' For his part, Mr. Munster has accused his opponent of playing the ''Medi-scare'' card with the elderly. On the sensitive local issue of Indians annexing land, Mr. Munster says that laws need to be changed to protect property owners, while Mr. Gejdenson says issues should be worked out between tribes and towns.</p>
        <p>Analysis</p>
        <p>After nearly defeating Mr. Gejdenson in 1994, Mr. Munster has been even more aggressive in this campaign. But Mr. Gejdenson has also been running hard. Both candidates have run negative advertisements. A recent independent poll showed Mr. Gejdenson leading by 13 percentage points, and his aides say he will benefit if Mr. Clinton wins a substantial victory in the state.</p>
        <p>Fifth District CandidatesGARY A. FRANKS, 43, Republican. Seeking his fourth term; was the first black Republican elected to the House in 60 years. Former labor relations executive who lives in Waterbury.</p>
        <p>JAMES H. MALONEY, 48, Democrat. Former state senator from Danbury and a lawyer; making his second attempt against Mr. Franks.</p>
        <p>The District</p>
        <p>The Fifth is economically diverse, with wealthy suburbs like Ridgefield and blue-collar cities like Waterbury and Meriden. Once a Democratic stronghold, it was seized by the Republicans in the 1984 Reagan landslide. It was the only Connecticut district George Bush won handily in 1992.</p>
        <p>The Issues</p>
        <p>Mr. Maloney is again trying to paint Mr. Franks as a Congressman out of touch with his district who has voted against moderate propsals like increasing the minimum wage and family leave. Mr. Franks defends his record while emphasizing economic development and his commitment to tax cuts and a balanced budget.</p>
        <p>Analysis</p>
        <p>Several factors may make this a close race: Mr. Franks benefited two years ago from having John G. Rowland, the Republican Governor who once held Mr. Franks's seat, on the ballot; and four years ago a third-party candidate split the Democratic vote. Mr. Maloney has also raised a relatively sizable campaign fund -- $440,000 as of Oct. 15 -- and is devoting more than a third of it to advertising. Mr. Franks raised $390,000, and has not campaigned aggressively, spending $85,700 on advertising as of Oct. 15. In addition, President Clinton's strong lead in the district may help Mr. Maloney.</p>
        <p>But although Mr. Maloney has gained 5 percentage points since July 31, according to a recent independent poll, Mr. Franks still has a 10-point lead. To win, Mr. Maloney has to overcome a significant hurdle: many voters still do not know who he is.</p>
        <p>Other House Races</p>
        <p>(X denotes incumbents)  FIRST DISTRICT Kent Sleath, Republican; Barbara B. Kennelly, Democrat (X)</p>
        <p>THIRD DISTRICT John Coppola, Republican; Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat (X)</p>
        <p>FOURTH DISTRICT Christopher Shays, Republican (X); Bill Finch, Democrat</p>
        <p>SIXTH DISTRICT Nancy L. Johnson, Republican (X); Charlotte Koskoff, Democrat</p>
        <p>PROPOSITIONS</p>
        <p>Question No. 1</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, the State Constitution would be amended to provide certain rights to crime victims.</p>
        <p>As well as other guarantees, victims would gain the right to make statements to the court before a plea agreement was accepted or the accused was sentenced, would be entitled to restitution, could communicate with prosecutors, be notified of court proceedings as well as the arrest, conviction, sentence, imprisonment and release of the accused.</p>
        <p>The Issues</p>
        <p>Supporters, pointing to repeated instances in which victims have been treated poorly in court, say they want to ''level the playing field'' between the accused and victims.</p>
        <p>Supporters of the proposition point to one celebrated case in Litchfield County: The mother of a murder victim, James B. Irwin Jr., was ordered by the judge to leave the courtroom, the judge publicly criticized comments made by the father, and they had to seek help from the State Legislature to receive a trial transcript.</p>
        <p>Opponents say trials would be turned into victim advocacy programs, diluting the primary interest of justice: determining the guilt or innocence of the accused. They predict erosion of the presumption of innocence, and a diminishing of the court's position of detachment in enforcing the law.</p>
        <p>They predict that a defendant could receive a lesser penalty if a prosecutor were persuaded by victims to reject plea bargaining and go to a trial when evidence is weak.</p>
        <p>Analysis</p>
        <p>Some 20 states have already approved similar resolutions. With the Connecticut Legislature overwhelmingly passing a resolution to place the issue on the ballot, the amendment is widely expected to pass, especially considering the unprovocative language of the question: ''Shall the Constitution of the State be amended to provide certain rights to victims of crime?''</p>
