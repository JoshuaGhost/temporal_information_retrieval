        <p>On a Centennial Tour,  Playing to the Converted</p>
        <p>Czech Philharmonic</p>
        <p>Avery Fisher Hall</p>
        <p>The Czech Philharmonic is an undeniably world-class orchestra. But the program the conductor Vladimir Valek and his players presented here on Sunday afternoon as part of its centennial tour was stupefyingly unimaginative.</p>
        <p>The concert began with the most famous movement of the most famous work by the most famous Czech nationalist composer: ''Vltava'' from ''Ma Vlast'' by Smetana.

In between was the Brahms Violin Concerto, which has already received two notable performances this season.</p>

        <p>On a Centennial Tour,  Playing to the Converted</p>
        <p>Czech Philharmonic</p>
        <p>Avery Fisher Hall</p>
        <p>The Czech Philharmonic is an undeniably world-class orchestra. But the program the conductor Vladimir Valek and his players presented here on Sunday afternoon as part of its centennial tour was stupefyingly unimaginative.</p>
        <p>The concert began with the most famous movement of the most famous work by the most famous Czech nationalist composer: ''Vltava'' from ''Ma Vlast'' by Smetana. And it ended with that Czech chestnut, Dvorak's ''New World'' Symphony, last heard at Avery Fisher Hall a month ago in a performance by Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic. In between was the Brahms Violin Concerto, which has already received two notable performances this season.</p>
        <p>In some ways the Czech Philharmonic is a tradition-bound orchestra. Except for two harpists, all the players are men. Yet surely Mr. Valek and these fine musicians have more sense of adventure. Has the Czech Philharmonic not commissioned a new work for its anniversary? Or might they have presented some Czech music little known to outsiders? At the very least, they could have played a different Dvorak symphony -- except the Seventh, which had been played on that stage just 18 hours earlier by the Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>Though the program was unchallenging, the playing was excellent. The strings are rich and true, the brass choirs are resonant yet never blaring. The winds have a rustic, reedy quality that is alluring and distinctive. The young violinist Alyssa Park gave an expansive, technically polished, thoughtful though not inspired performance in the Brahms. The ''New World'' Symphony had dash and buoyancy. But all in all, this was a great missed opportunity to do something memorable for a significant anniversary.</p>
