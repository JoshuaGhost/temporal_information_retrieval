        <p>With the tropical heat beating down from a leaden sky, family members and other mourners began crowding a funeral home here just before noon the other day.</p>
        <p>Most of the usual elements of a funeral were in place. A black hearse sat near the entrance, and clutches of men in dark suits or matronly women in lacy hats stood speaking to each other in hushed voices as they awaited the start of a wake.</p>
        <p>What stood out for the uninitiated visitor was something else altogether. Here and there, the concrete courtyard where the service was held was sprinkled with sharply dressed young women who, with their smiles beckoning from behind dark sunglasses or occasional winks, seemed distinctly on the make.</p>
        <p>''I come every Friday, not because I know the deceased people or even their families, but because you get to meet a lot of people here,'' said one of them, Carole Aby, a 28-year-old secretary who confessed that her motives for turning up had nothing to do with paying respects to the dead.</p>
        <p>''When you try to get an appointment with someone who is important around this town, whether it is to look for a job or whatever, their secretaries or their bodyguards prevent you. But here, everyone is fair game.''</p>
        <p>This is Ivosep, a private morgue and funeral home housed on a busy intersection of Abidjan's broadest avenue that for years has been the country's most prestigious place of mourning. More surprisingly, on Thursdays and Fridays, its busiest days, it has also become Abidjan's hottest scene for pickups and other social encounters and, for many, the start of their weekends.</p>
        <p>Under the cover of outwardly somber funeral rites, pickups are made at a furious pace, often after nothing more than a few words are whispered during the traditional French-style embraces that people exchange as they greet each other in receiving lines.</p>
        <p>''Generally, you might give three kisses if it's just to give your name to someone, or add a fourth to give you time to tell them your telephone number,'' Miss Aby said, referring to the prosperous, usually married men who she said are the favorite targets in this game.</p>
        <p>''Then you arrange to be in their field of view. When it is time to leave, either he gives you some kind of signal, or you ask for a ride. Usually, the connections are made just as easily as that.''</p>
        <p>Experts on West African cultures say the notion that such an outwardly morbid meeting place should have registered this kind of social success is explained by the class divisions and sociology of a society in the throes of rapid change, where the deeply rooted traditions of a shrinking rural universe still rub shoulders with a slick and increasingly Westernized modern world.</p>
        <p>In this hybrid arena of values old and new, the family is sacrosanct and yet so extended that you cannot possibly recognize everyone who might claim to be a relative. Therefore, the presence of many seeming strangers at a funeral goes unquestioned.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, polygamy, open or undeclared, though formally illegal, shocks almost no one. So, within the bounds of a certain amount of decorum, married men, and increasingly married women too, feel free to play the field.</p>
        <p>And in a society where family connections often count for more than competence, and opportunities are sharply limited, marrying up, or using sex to secure a job or some other kind of material advantage, is a commonplace strategy for advancement.</p>
        <p>''Funerals have always drawn big crowds and been a vehicle for social mobility,'' said Dedy Sery, an anthropologist at the University of the Ivory Coast. ''But in this modern context we have seen a break with tradition. In the past, engaging in outright seduction during the mourning period was taboo.</p>
        <p>''Now, the cruising is open and we are seeing the world turned on its head. Young women come all dressed up to places like Ivosep because they are sure to meet men there who are just as eager to play the game of seduction in a place that is supposedly dedicated to the dead.''</p>
        <p>In many West African societies, where ancestors are venerated, death is still treated with the utmost seriousness, requiring, among other rites, that the deceased's children shave their heads and wear dark clothing for a prolonged period of mourning.</p>
        <p>But in the crucible of fast-growing cities like Abidjan, mourning traditions seem to be rapidly melting away.</p>
        <p>''I am not too affected by this death, because the old man had lived his life,'' said Odette Kinan, a 30-year-old beautician, dressed to the nines in a tightly fitting skirt, who was attending the wake of her fiance's father.</p>
        <p>''If you find that I'm a bit well dressed for a sad occasion, you are just not used to the scene here. Ivosep is a paradise of high dressing, because you can never know whom you are going to meet, or what it is going to lead to.''</p>
        <p>Plainly, not everyone is happy with the recent evolution of attitudes toward mourning and courtship. For some, it is a clear and troubling sign of a decay in African moral values.</p>
        <p>''We are becoming the targets of a new kind of prostitution that is not honest enough to go by that name,'' said Babacar Haidara, a 38-year-old banker.</p>
        <p>''In the courtyard of Ivosep you hear bursts of laughter more often than sobbing these days. Each of us is more preoccupied with seeing what we can get for ourselves than sharing others' pain.''</p>
