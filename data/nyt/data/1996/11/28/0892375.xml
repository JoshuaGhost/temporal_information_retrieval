        <p>It happens to all the great ones, Keyshawn Johnson explained today, following his most frustrating stretch as a Jet. If he doesn't get the ball early, he'll drop the ball late.</p>

        <p>It happens to all the great ones, Keyshawn Johnson explained today, following his most frustrating stretch as a Jet. If he doesn't get the ball early, he'll drop the ball late.</p>
        <p>He likened his travails to the National Football League's greatest receiver, the 49ers' Jerry Rice. ''When he doesn't get involved early, he struggles,'' Johnson said. ''You have to get the great ones in the flow.''</p>
        <p>Johnson dropped three passes in last week's trouncing by the Bills and had only a fourth-quarter catch good for 10 yards.</p>
        <p>Perhaps life for Johnson, and all the other bedeviled Jets, will change against the Houston Oilers on Sunday at Giants Stadium when Neil O'Donnell returns to quarterback after six games on the sideline with a separated throwing shoulder.</p>
        <p>But how is this for more Jet misfortune? O'Donnell, Coach Rich Kotite and the offensive coordinator, Ron Erhardt, had been waiting half the season for O'Donnell's return to the practice field today. And when he finally did come back, he didn't have either Johnson or the other starting wide receiver, Jeff Graham, to throw to. He probably will not get them until Sunday. Graham has a bruised toe and Johnson has a hip-muscle strain and neither will practice all week. Each is listed as 50-50 to play.</p>
        <p>Johnson may deny it, but he is frustrated. He was shouting to the heavens when Frank Reich's passes went through his hands against the Bills. His wide receivers coach, Richard Mann, said Johnson had one drop ''and two others that would have been tough catches.''</p>
        <p>Johnson said of his role, ''You're blocking, then when they finally throw to you it's such a shock.''</p>
        <p>Only one Sunday before, Johnson narrowly missed becoming a folk hero for the week when the last-second, desperation pass that could have won the game was knocked out of his hands in Indianapolis. He couldn't believe his bad fortune and remained face down for almost a minute after the final gun sounded. To many fans, that portrait of the usually unflappable and upbeat Johnson heralded a change, or at least a weariness, as a result of his new surroundings.</p>
        <p>Again, he said he wants to be in there every play, a lament he has voiced since the opening game of the season. He did not become a starter until Game 3, and since then he has become one of the league's top rookie receivers. His five touchdowns are the most among first-year players, but his number of catches a game and average are dwindling. Over all, he has snared 46 passes for 583 yards, an average of 12.7.</p>
        <p>''When I don't get involved early,'' he said today, ''I don't produce that well. It's been the case throughout my career. I got involved in the first Buffalo game and I shoved it down their throats.''</p>
        <p>In that contest, returning after two games out with knee surgery, he had his most productive game with 8 catches, 2 touchdowns and 94 yards.</p>
        <p>''This is no knock against the system,'' said Johnson, knocking something, at any rate. ''In any receiver's case, you have to get them involved.''</p>
        <p>Erhardt dismissed Johnson's complaints.</p>
        <p>''All I know is the quarterback throws the ball to the receiver that's open,'' Erhardt said. ''If you throw to him early and then he's not open late, what difference does it make?''</p>
        <p>Johnson has groaned this season that he isn't used enough, or that the quarterback throws to him too short. Asked today whether it's possible he's not open early in the game, he snapped, ''If anyone tells you that, he's a liar.''</p>
        <p>O'Donnell has actually had precious few opportunities to throw to Johnson. They have been together only three games with Johnson as a starter. Their last time together, O'Donnell connected with him eight times. But Johnson then went out with a knee injury and O'Donnell was to suffer his separated shoulder. They still are not together.</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>HUGH DOUGLAS lost his sack of Bills quarterback TODD COLLINS after the league reviewed film of the game. Still, Douglas leads the team in sacks with five.</p>
