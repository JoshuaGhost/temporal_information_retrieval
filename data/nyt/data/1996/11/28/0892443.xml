        <p>Indiana University is an icon of college basketball, winner of national championships, celebrated in books and movies, home ground of the bombastic Coach Bobby Knight. Evansville is, well, Evansville, which struggled last season to a 13-14 record and fifth place in the Missouri Valley Conference.</p>
        <p>Last night, in the semifinals of the Chase National Invitation Tournament, Indiana beat Evansville, 74-73, only because Andrae Patterson sank a 6-foot jump shot at the buzzer. As far as an angry Knight was concerned, Indiana lost.</p>
        <p>''The first thing I'd like to do is apologize for our win,'' he said. ''I don't think we should have won, not with some of the plays we didn't make. Evansville deserved to win. There was no justice in this win for us. We just don't deserve to be there on Friday.''</p>
        <p>Deserved or not, Indiana (now 4-0) will be there at 9:30 P.M. tomorrow, playing Duke (3-0) in the final. In the first semifinal, the crowd of 15,496 watched Duke trail by 10 points, then lead by 10, then hold off Tulsa, 72-67.</p>
        <p>Tulsa (2-1) will face Evansville (2-1) in the 7 P.M. consolation game tomorrow. In the Associated Press poll of news media, Duke is ranked sixth in the nation, Indiana 20th and Tulsa 22d. Evansville is unranked.</p>
        <p>Indiana was shooting erratically but surviving on free throws. With 2 minutes 48 seconds left, Indiana led by 72-64, and many spectators were heading for the exits.</p>
        <p>But Indiana suddenly seemed headed for the exits, too. Stuart Sullivan, Evansville's 6-foot point guard, led a comeback. He sank a 3-point jumper. He stole the ball. He drove for a layup. Evansville closed to 72-71, and when Marcus Wilson banked in an 8-foot driving jumper with 21.8 seconds left, Evansville led, 73-72.</p>
        <p>With 1.2 seconds left, Indiana had the ball out of bounds on the sideline near Indiana's basket. It was nervous time. Evansville took a timeout. Indiana took a timeout. Evansville took a timeout again.</p>
        <p>Finally, they played. A. J. Guyton, Indiana's point guard, passed the ball to Patterson, just off the baseline. Evansville had its tallest player, the 6-foot-9-inch Jeff Layden, in the game, but Patterson, a 6-8 junior, turned and arched a soft jumper. As the buzzer sounded, the ball dropped through softly, nothing but net, and Indiana lived for another day.</p>
        <p>''It looked very good from the moment he shot it,'' Sullivan said. ''He got too good a look at the basket.''</p>
        <p>While Knight did not enjoy winning, Jim Crews, the Evansville coach, did not enjoy losing that way to the man who coached him at Indiana 20 years before.</p>
        <p>''Anytime you lose,'' Crews said, ''you don't feel good. When you invest as much as our players invest and you lose, you feel bad. If you don't invest a lot, you don't feel as bad. At the same time, we understand that it's just a game. We are still going to enjoy our Thanksgiving.''</p>
        <p>In the Duke-Tulsa game, Rod Thompson of Tulsa buried a 24-foot 3-point shot with 25.1 seconds left, closing the gap to 69-67. After a free throw raised Duke's lead to 70-67, Tulsa tried desperately to get the ball to its best player, 6-5 Shea Seals, for another 3-pointer. It could not.</p>
        <p>''We were down 3, had the last shot and we just didn't come through,'' said Tulsa Coach Steve Robinson. ''We ended up with our big guys handling the basketball, and we couldn't reset. You have to give Duke credit.''</p>
        <p>The credit, said Coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, belonged to his defense, especially since Tulsa had a 50-to-35 edge in rebounds.</p>
        <p>''Tulsa killed us on the boards,'' he said, ''but our defense kept us in the game. We forced 24 turnovers. And at the end, we wanted to force them into a 2-point shot, not a 3, and it worked.''</p>
        <p>Duke was a 4-point favorite over Tulsa and will be a slight favorite over Indiana, but Krzyzewski is careful not to put too much expectations on his young team.</p>
        <p>''We're not a top 10 team now,'' he said. ''But we play hard. We're improving.''</p>
