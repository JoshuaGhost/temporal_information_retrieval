        <p>A new baseball labor agreement was so elusive that it defied the intervention of President Clinton. Then Randy Levine came along.</p>
        <p>In just one year on the job as the owners' chief negotiator, the Brooklyn-born grandson of two men who were union leaders succeeded where the President, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, John Calhoun Wells of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the veteran mediator William J. Usery, Richard Ravitch, Bud Selig, John Harrington, Jerry McMorris and Charles O'Connor had failed.</p>
        <p>That is why Major League Baseball today is about to embark on an era of labor peace and, it expects, economic growth.</p>
        <p>A few issues have to be cleared up before the union's executive board ratifies the new agreement next week. But it is highly unlikely that Levine would now encounter problems with Donald Fehr, the players' labor chief, after they made a breakthrough that, while not unprecedented, was unusual, and after the owners turned their repudiation of Levine into vindication.</p>
        <p>''I don't look at it as I was repudiated or vindicated,'' Levine said yesterday before leaving with his wife, Mindy, for a holiday weekend in the country. ''I look at it as the process was vindicated. Here is an agreement that will go on for the next five years that makes revolutionary changes.''</p>
        <p>The owners did not initially want to accept the changes, rejecting the agreement by an 18-12 vote. But three weeks later, at a meeting in Chicago on Tuesday, they embraced the agreement, 26-4, deciding that it was better to put their arms around something than to fill their heads and stomachs with more aches.</p>
        <p>''I was very disappointed because I'm human,'' Levine said of the initial rejection. ''Now I feel gratified to have been a part of solving this process and trying to restore baseball to where I think it belongs -- as the national pastime.''</p>
        <p>But why was Levine able to succeed where all of those others had failed? It was not a new experience for the 41-year-old lawyer, who likes to play golf, ride horses, stroll in the woods in Duchess County, where he and his wife spend weekends on their mini-farm. He also walks the streets of Manhattan when he takes his two Labradors out at 6 A.M. and midnight every day. After all, he came to his $600,000-a-year baseball job from his post as New York City's labor commissioner under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''In my experience as a negotiator,'' Levine said, ''most of my assignments have been in extraordinarily tough situations where people thought things couldn't change and where often other people hadn't been able to get the job done through no fault of their own. I guess it's just a certain style I have. I try to view collective bargaining as problem solving, not as winning or losing, not about hurting the next guy. It's about industries where people have to work together. I always try to keep my word; if you can't, you don't have credibility. I guess I'm also a bit of a masochist.''</p>
        <p>Ron Shapiro, a prominent player agent, offered another reason.</p>
        <p>''When Randy Levine came on the scene, he brought a combination of credibility and sensitivity to his office that never had existed there before,'' Shapiro said, speaking from 20 years of baseball experience. ''That broke the dam of mistrust between the union and the player relations committee.''</p>
        <p>Lauren Rich, one of the primary negotiators through the long-running dispute, was one of the union people who came to appreciate Levine's skills.</p>
        <p>''In order to get something like this done, given what we've gone through,'' she said, ''you need two people who always will be searching for solutions and who are willing to bang heads among their constituencies. Randy was always searching for ways to accommodate interests on both sides and was willing, when he thought he got to that point, to bang heads. None of their other chief negotiators brought those things to the table with such a passion.''</p>
        <p>One person who was not surprised by Levine's achievement was the man he worked for before he stepped into baseball's field of land mines.</p>
        <p>''Part of the problem the city used to have in labor relations was the unions didn't trust the city,'' Giuliani said. ''They felt the city was hiding money. The core of Randy's ability is a relationship of trust and confidence, trying to figure out what's the objective we want to reach and how to get there so everyone has confidence we're not trying to hide anything.''</p>
        <p>Giuliani cited two examples of Levine's work for the city: the workfare program in which people on welfare work for the city in return for their benefits and a severance and redeployment program in which the city bought out 23,000 municipal employees and transferred workers from one agency to another to fill resulting gaps.</p>
        <p>But, the Mayor said, ''What he had to accomplish in baseball was more difficult.''</p>
        <p>Levine, a graduate of Hofstra Law School, first became involved in baseball in 1990 as outside counsel to George Steinbrenner and the Yankees when he was a partner with Proskauer Rose Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn. In that role, Levine attended the owners' first meeting on revenue sharing in Kohler, Wis., in 1993.</p>
        <p>A lawyer with the Justice Department in Washington from 1985 to 1988, he worked in Giuliani's mayoral campaigns in 1989 and 1993, then joined the administration as labor commissioner, a post he held for about two years. Then baseball beckoned. ''I took this job because I love baseball,'' Levine said. ''I thought I could contribute to solving this nightmare. I never saw an industry where there was more mistrust -- on both sides. I think Don was skeptical at first, but as we took baby steps, then giant steps that weekend in August, I think we came to have a mutual respect.''</p>
        <p>That weekend, Aug. 9-11, was the turning point in the negotiations.</p>
        <p>''I think the key was late Friday night,'' Levine said. ''I told the union I was authorized to make a last and final offer and go to court if necessary. We both knew once we did that, it would be hard to make a deal. We had real serious discussions about what the issues were. After that, we started to break through on the tax threshold, the number of years on the luxury tax revenue sharing. We started to build momentum.''</p>
        <p>Despite his efforts, Levine found himself on the short end of the owners' Nov. 6 vote and prepared to resign. He may still leave the job sooner rather than later, but he said he has made no decision.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to take a nice long respite after the agreement is signed,'' he said. ''I'll take some time off, go upstate, smell the flowers a little bit and see where we go from there. We'll weigh all the opportunities, whether in baseball or outside, and see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Whether sooner or later, Levine will very likely return to the Giuliani administration, perhaps as deputy mayor. Asked yesterday about that possibility, Giuliani said, ''You can be certain, one way or another, we'll be working together again.''</p>
