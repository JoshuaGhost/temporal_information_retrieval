        <p>November and December are hot months for sample sales, with more than 70 this week. The fashion shows just ended so designers, manufacturers and middle men have time to open their doors to sell off their excess inventory to the public. Merchandise is generally at least half off the retail price, sometimes more. Biggest savings are on damaged merchandise, items from last season and those made in sample sizes (for men, small; for women, size 6 and 8).</p>
        <p>''The best time to go is the first day of the sale, but if you go on the last day, they generally mark the prices way down,'' said Ann Rizzo, editor of the S &amp; B Report, a monthly guide to the sales. Here are some of this week's top sales, according to The S&amp;B Report.</p>
