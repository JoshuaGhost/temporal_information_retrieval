        <p>For most of his coaching career in pro football, Bill Parcells has believed that a quarterback has two main functions:</p>

        <p>For most of his coaching career in pro football, Bill Parcells has believed that a quarterback has two main functions:</p>
        <p>A. Hand off the ball to the tailback.</p>
        <p>B. Hand off the ball to the fullback.</p>
        <p>If A and B fail, he may let the quarterback pass on third down so he can resume A and B.</p>
        <p>But the coach who used the running of Joe Morris and O. J. Anderson to win two Super Bowl titles for the Giants has done the unimaginable with the New England Patriots. He has his quarterback passing the ball -- 43 times a game last season, 40 times this season. He is passing more often than rushing.</p>
        <p>It is not a change in philosophy. Parcells just wants to utilize his best weapons, and his best is a 24-year-old, 6-foot-5-inch, 233-pound quarterback named Drew Bledsoe whose passing statistics for his first three pro seasons have surpassed those of even Dan Marino.</p>
        <p>At 1 P.M. Sunday at Giants Stadium, the ticket-holders who brave the cold and the wind and NBC viewers (Channel 4 in New York) will watch Bledsoe and the Patriots (6-3) take on the Jets (1-8).</p>
        <p>In Ben Coates, the Patriots have a premier pass-catching tight end. But Shawn Jefferson and the rookie Terry Glenn, the wide receivers, have come along so well that Bledsoe no longer has to force the ball to Coates on third down. The receivers are his best ever with the Patriots.</p>
        <p>On the last two Sundays, Bledsoe passed for 373 yards against the Buffalo Bills and 419 against the Miami Dolphins (the Patriots won both games). For the season, he is averaging 264 yards a game, with 15 touchdown passes.</p>
        <p>''I think he's starting to develop body language with his receivers,'' Jets Coach Rich Kotite said. ''I think he's playing with a lot more confidence.''</p>
        <p>The Patriots are not one-dimensional. Curtis Martin rushed for 1,487 yards last year as a rookie and has 698 yards this year. In his two games against the Jets, he has rushed for 166 and 148 yards.</p>
        <p>Even if the Jets contain Martin, Bledsoe is another matter. As Jets defensive tackle Matt Brock, ''Bledsoe is carrying their team now.''</p>
        <p>There is an obvious way to combat Bledsoe.</p>
        <p>''You try to get pressure on him and make him throw before he's ready,'' safety Lonnie Young said. ''Like anyone else, you get enough heat on him and he'll get nervous feet.''</p>
        <p>If there was a nervous time for the Patriots, it should have come in the first two weeks of the season. They started with road games against the Dolphins and the Bills, who figured to be their toughest division rivals. They lost by 24-10 to the Dolphins and 17-10 to the Bills.</p>
        <p>''We didn't panic,'' Bledsoe said. ''The Miami game was kind of a wake-up call because we really didn't play well. At Buffalo, we played better even though we lost. After that game, we thought we could be a good team. We actually are a good team.</p>
        <p>''Probably the biggest difference for us this year is the emergence of the two wideouts and the level at which they're playing. I put the ball out there and they come up with it. When you have that, you can take more chances.''</p>
        <p>Chances or not, Bledsoe has thrown only 6 interceptions in 363 pass attempts. ''Part of it is that I'm making better decisions,'' he said, ''and part is luck. When you put the ball in the air, sometimes they're going to make a great play. Right now, the strength of our offense is our passing game. For us to continue to win, we're going to have to do a better job running the football.''</p>
        <p>Until then, Bledsoe has to keep the Patriots winning, and he is doing fine so far. ''A lot of things used to bother him,'' Parcells said, ''but they don't bother him now. I think he's taking each game for what it is. He doesn't get distracted. He focuses pretty much on the task at hand. He's under tremendous scrutiny, but I think he has matured.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>In the last game before their bye week, the Jets beat the Arizona Cardinals, 31-21, for their only victory of the season as ADRIAN MURRELL rushed for 199 yards. . . . The Jets' defensive front gets back middle linebacker MARVIN JONES (knee), who missed four weeks, and defensive end HUGH DOUGLAS (ankle), who missed six. Both had good practice weeks. . . . When the Patriots' coaches arrive at the stadium, they must remember which locker room they want. Eleven of them have worked for the Giants -- BILL PARCELLS, BILL BELICHICK, RAY PERKINS, AL GROH, ROMEO CRENNEL, CHARLIE WEIS, MAURICE CARTHON, FRED HOAGLIN, MIKE POPE, MIKE SWEATMAN and JOHNNY PARKER.</p>
