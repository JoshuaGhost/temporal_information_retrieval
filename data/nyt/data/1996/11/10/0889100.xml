        <p>The labor movement didn't return Congress to Democratic control, but it still had one big thing to boast about last week: It won a contract from Bridgestone/Firestone, the tire maker that unions have been battling for 28 months.</p>
        <p>Through a campaign of picketing and ads that urged a boycott and embarrassed the tire company, the United Steelworkers of America, the parent union for the nation's rubber workers, pressured Bridgestone/Firestone into signing an agreement.</p>
        <p>The rubber workers walked out in July 1994, but the dispute escalated six months later when the company hired 2,300 permanent substitutes to replace the 4,200 strikers. Hobbled by this, the workers ended their strike in May 1995, and since then Bridgestone/Firestone has slowly rehired most of the strikers.</p>
        <p>Pending ratification, the company agreed to take back the 50 strikers still not rehired. It also agreed to increase holidays and pension contributions and grant the industry's first across-the-board raise since 1982. In exchange, the union accepted mandatory 12-hour days and called off its pressure campaign.</p>
