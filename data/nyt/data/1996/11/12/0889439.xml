        <p>Tepper has won praise for running a clean program with a player-graduation rate above 90 percent. His program to promote racial harmony among players has also earned him accolades.</p>
        <p>But Tepper has a 25-29-2 record in five seasons. The former defensive coordinator has produced teams with inconsistent offenses. The program has had three offensive coordinators under Tepper.</p>
