        <p>NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, met here today with Vice President Al Gore, a senior NATO official said, and came away with the conviction that the United States would agree to take part in a follow-on force in Bosnia after the current mandate ends on Dec. 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solana told Mr. Gore that a meeting was scheduled for Monday  to choose what form a NATO follow-on force would take, according to the official, who said that Mr. Gore did not dissuade Mr. Solana from going ahead with the meeting.</p>

        <p>NATO's Secretary General, Javier Solana, met here today with Vice President Al Gore, a senior NATO official said, and came away with the conviction that the United States would agree to take part in a follow-on force in Bosnia after the current mandate ends on Dec. 20.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solana told Mr. Gore that a meeting was scheduled for Monday  to choose what form a NATO follow-on force would take, according to the official, who said that Mr. Gore did not dissuade Mr. Solana from going ahead with the meeting.</p>
        <p>''They know very well what the majority consensus is within NATO,  and the military people all agree'' the official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Solana has been ''sure'' and remains sure that the Americans would not leave Bosnia now, the NATO official said.</p>
        <p>''It would be very difficult to abandon Bosnia now, and if the American forces leave, all the forces will pull out together,'' the official said.</p>
        <p>The NATO meeting on Monday in Brussels is intended to formally adopt ''option three'' for a follow-on force intended to deter any outbreak of fighting while helping to insure freedom of movement for all Bosnians. That option would involve some 25,000 to 30,000 troops, about half the  number in the current force. American troops, if the President chooses to send them, are likely to account for a quarter or a third of the force,  roughly the same proportion as in the current force.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's responses gave the Secretary General confidence that President Clinton would make an announcement on American participation by the end of the week, the official said.</p>
        <p>That information was further bolstered by a word from the White House. At a briefing today, Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman, said, ''There's a North Atlantic Council meeting that is upcoming on Monday that is going to really get more deeply into the question of what kind of force ought to be available in Bosnia after the expiration'' of the current NATO force.</p>
        <p>He said that the President has been addressing the issue of participation in Bosnia and in the refugee crisis in Zaire ''almost simultaneously.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton is leaving on Friday for a trip to Asia. Mr. McCurry said, ''I suspect some time before departing he may want to speak publicly on both of these issues.''</p>
        <p>A senior Administration official said that a recommendation on the matter must be agreed on by involved Cabinet officials, and that a plan to use troops might be harder to sell in Washington than in the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>The official explained that Mr. Clinton has to decide if the benefits of another year in Bosnia are worth the political and military costs.</p>
        <p>The President refused to make the decision on the issue before the election. However, at a news conference on Friday Mr. Clinton said he was  considering committting troops to a follow-on force.</p>
        <p>The NATO official, who insisted on anonymity, acknowledged that an American decision not to participate at this point would create a significant crisis in NATO just as the alliance, at Washington's urging, is preparing to expand. The official said he expected that the smaller force would have a different and less ambitious mission.</p>
        <p>As the next year goes on, the official said, it is possible that more troops could leave Bosnia if there was progress on the civilian side. After municipal elections, which are likely to take place between April and June, it is conceivable that many troops, including most Americans, could leave Bosnia. Some would be  stationed outside the border in case they were needed.</p>
        <p>The civilian side was addressed in Paris today where Secretary of State Warren Christopher pressed Bosnia's Serbs to live up to the Dayton peace accord and allow refugees to reclaim their homes.</p>
        <p>Meeting with representatives of Bosnia's three ethnic groups, Mr. Christopher and European officials sought today to chart a course toward peace and allow the West to withdraw its troops from Bosnia two years from now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher's diplomatic pleas appeared to have had little effect on the Bosnian Serbs' longstanding opposition to resettlement of Muslims in territory from which they had been ''ethnically cleansed'' during the war. Momcilo Krajisnik, the Bosnian Serb member of Bosnia's three-member presidency, had ''no immediate response,'' to Mr. Christopher's condemnation of a Serbian armed attack in northeastern Bosnia yesterday on Muslims who were seeking to reclaim their homes, Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said tonight.</p>
        <p>But officials in Washington and Europe have already made it clear that they do not intend to aggressively enforce key provisions of the peace plan, which guarantees refugees a right to return to their homes.</p>
        <p>''We are at a very critical stage in Bosnia,'' Mr. Christopher, perhaps on his last Bosnian-related mission as Secretary of State, said tonight at the Quai d'Orsay beneath a portrait of Cardinal Richelieu, the ruthless and cynical 17th-century French statesman whose talents would not have been lost on Bosnia.</p>
        <p>NATO military force could stop the fighting, but whether it can make the parties agree to get along with each other and build a civil society together -- the objective of this week's conference here -- is another question.</p>
        <p>However, French officials said that the fighting did not even come up during a luncheon that Foreign Minister Herve de Charette had today with Mr. Krajisnik and his colleagues elected two months ago to the Bosnian presidency, Kresimir Zubak, a Croat, and Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Charette said on Tuesday that the international military presence should be withdrawn step by step during the next two years.</p>
