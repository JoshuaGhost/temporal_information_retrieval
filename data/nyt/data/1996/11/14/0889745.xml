        <p>Growth in Germany stayed on track in the third quarter, but the country's recovery was still driven by foreign orders as domestic investment lagged, the Economics Ministry said yesterday. German gross domestic product probably rose 2 percent in real terms in the third quarter from the comparable period last year after an expansion of 1.2 percent in the second quarter, the ministry said in its monthly report.</p>
        <p>Independent economists said the figures showed that the recovery was intact, but they were concerned that the estimate came so soon after the release of weak September output and orders data, which were not yet revised.</p>
