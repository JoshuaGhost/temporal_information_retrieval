        <p>They are a little-known force among the city's many law enforcement agencies: a group of armed officers whose focus is not drug dealers or murderers but the 30,000 tons of garbage that New Yorkers produce each day.</p>
        <p>But the importance of the work of the city's 117-member Sanitation Police Department only came into sharp focus this week, when a sanitation worker was killed and another was injured by a corrosive acid that had been improperly discarded. One of the main duties of the sanitation police is to see that such highly toxic wastes do not enter the city's waste stream, an awesome challenge given the amount of industrial refuse produced in the city each day.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, members of the sanitation police force worked closely with the New York Police Department and the Department of Environmental Protection to find the people who illegally left the deadly hydrofluoric acid on the street with regular garbage.</p>
        <p>But while the force finds itself now involved in a high-profile murder investigation, its other duties can be more mundane: making sure homeowners do not mingle their tuna cans with last night's leftovers, catching illegal dumpers and nabbing the dog owner who does not clean up after his pet.</p>
        <p>The officers are trained much like other city police officers, told to always be on the lookout for confrontations that could suddenly turn violent. At a class of trainees this week at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, the potential danger of confronting violators was not lost on the recruits, even as they snickered as instructors acted out the stopping of a driver in traffic.</p>
        <p>''You pulled me over for littering?'' shouted Sanitation Police Officer John Spano, the instructor playing the sanitation scofflaw who had just lobbed a drink container out his car window.</p>
        <p>''What are you bothering me for?'' he continued with escalating attitude. ''Why don't you go arrest a drug dealer or something?''</p>
        <p>But the 26 fresh-faced recruits turned somber when another instructor, Sanitation Police Officer William Monjardo, showed them the finer points of frisking a suspect and told them how to stand to avoid getting shot. He stressed that pulling a car over, even for something as seemingly innocuous as littering, could turn into a life-threatening situation.</p>
        <p>The sanitation police, who undergo a six-week training period, bring to their law enforcement work a peculiar background: they all came from the ranks of the city's sanitation workers, having hauled trash or driven street sweepers. They can apply to the police force after two years on the job, and must have a strong record as sanitation workers to be chosen.</p>
        <p>Their more perilous duties involve having to stake out vacant lots to catch illegal dumpers or put on protective gear to investigate the criminal disposal of asbestos or toxic wastes. The officers are also sometimes called on to respond to domestic disputes, shootings and stabbings.</p>
        <p>''Wearing this uniform out on the street, these guys have to be trained for the unexpected,'' said Lieut. Anthony Colaianni, the lead instructor of new recruits.</p>
        <p>He noted that sanitation police wear the same uniforms and bulletproof vests and carry the same guns that New York police officers do. The only distinguishing feature is an arm patch that reads Sanitation Police.</p>
        <p>Inspector Richard Diffendale, who weeded through more than 60 applications from sanitation workers to choose the latest class of 26 recruits, said he sought out people with good work records and the right kind of personality.</p>
        <p>''When we interview people for police training, we look for someone who can use his head and who we're comfortable won't be a problem in the field because you never know what's going to get thrown at you,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Once on the street, most sanitation police officers patrol alone. Most of their work involves tickets to store owners who have neglected to sweep their sidewalks or clean the gutters in front of their businesses, and tickets to homeowners and apartment building managers who are not recycling properly. But special units investigate illegal dumping and hazardous waste problems, like the dumping that killed the sanitation worker. there is also a canine patrol to enforce the pooper-scooper law.</p>
        <p>Hector Marrero, 24, a trainee who has been with the Sanitation Department for three years, said he was glad to trade his garbage- hauling tasks for police work.</p>
        <p>''I've already heard all the wisecracks from my friends, like: 'Hey, you're a garbage cop, come and protect my garbage,' '' Mr. Marrero said. ''But I don't pay much attention to it because no matter what they say, this is important work.''</p>
