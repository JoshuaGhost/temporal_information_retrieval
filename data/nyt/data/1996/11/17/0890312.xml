        <p>THERE is the last rose of summer. There are the ubiquitous mums. There are sturdy asters. Collectively, these flowers mark the end of the season. Few gardeners would add anemones to the list, but it is time to give this overlooked flower its due.</p>
        <p>The venerable fall-blooming anemone was in full glory this year through early November. It bloomed in glorious white, unchallenged by unsightly faded stalks of perennials that had long since given up, until a truly hard frost hit. After enjoying this beautiful late fall scene, it was decided to give these stalwart anemones a plug.</p>
        <p>The plant is tall and stately, about three feet or so, and needs a background position to flourish. Known popularly as the Japanese anemone, this is a perennial with very mixed parentage. Most of the plants sold today are listed in catalogues as Anemone x hybrida. The plant was introduced to the garden world in 1844 by Robert Fortune of Scotland. (He was the first collector to enter China in 1842 after the Opium War.)</p>
        <p>There are many named cultivars of this fall-blooming type. Some have single flowers, others have semi-double flowers. Probably the most popular is an elegant white anemone called Honorine Jobert. It has been in cultivation since the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Incidentally, anemone flowers do not have petals. The showy part of the plant that we think are flowers are actually petal-like sepals. The styles of the flowers are those beautiful feathery parts that persist after fruit starts to develop. With some of the anemones, the stalks are left standing to be dried and used for flower arrangements.</p>
        <p>The anemone clan is a huge one, somewhere around 70 species. The common name is windflower, attributed to Pliny the Elder, who wrote: ''The flowers do not open unless the wind blows: hence the name.''</p>
        <p>Pliny may have been referring to Anemone coronaria, which is the biblical lily of the field, often grown by greenhouse hobbyists or sold as cut flowers, but not hardy in New England. Two popular strains are the St. Brigid and de Caen.</p>
        <p>A particular favorite windflower is the bulbous Anemone blanda, which appears in early spring. The natural species is a glorious deep blue color, but the bulb growers have been busy with this one and now there are pink, white, lighter blue and almost purple-colored flowers. This delightful spring harbinger grows low and can be a sprightly edging for paths, drives or flower borders. It is easy to plant in fall provided the tubers are soaked overnight in warm water to plump them up since they dry out quickly in storage and shipping.</p>
        <p>Blooming about the same time are the wood anemones. The native American species, A. quinquefolia has showy leaves and perky white flowers. The European anemone (A. nemorosa) is similar but considered a bit showier. Both are good semi-shade plants and spread easily if well situated. Their foliage disappears soon after bloom so it is essential not to dig them up by mistake.</p>
        <p>The European pasque flower (A. pulsatilla) is one of the more curious. It blooms before the leaves pop up, long after the flowers fade, the collar of leaves appear. They are equally attractive and the feathery plumes left by the faded flowers are coveted for drying and artistic displays.</p>
        <p>Because it has a bad reputation as an invasive, somewhat aggressive plant, the snowdrop anemone (A. sylvestris) has not often been recommended as part of a general border planting. Yet for its showy white blooms in spring followed by the consistent display of foliage, it does have its merits. In mass this can be quite an attractive addition to an area that needs some early spring color. The feathery fruit that poke up on the foot-high plants are also a plus.</p>
        <p>Lest there is some confusion, there is another early spring plant that has a similar name but it is not part of this clan, although all the plants mentioned are in the buttercup family. This one is the rue anemone (Anemonella thalictriodes). This is a native woodland wildling and quite delicate compared to the garden anemones. Common field marks for this plant are easy to remember: a foliage collar of three-lobed leaves just under the blooms and rather than single blooms per spike, there  are clusters of three, maybe more. This is an extremely delicate-looking plant that is often passed by if those seeking it are not looking carefully, but can be grown easily from seed.</p>
        <p>When the perennial and seed catalogues start to arrive in January, there will be plenty of time to study, and maybe there might be some space saved to incorporate an anemone or two.</p>
        <p>The plants' requirements should match their natural habitats. Wood anemones require generous amounts of humus in the soil and damp growing conditions. Fall-blooming sorts are splendid in a semi-shaded area where the soil is fertile but drains well. For the greenhouse growers, a good fertilization program is needed to bring the tuberous roots along to full flower.</p>
