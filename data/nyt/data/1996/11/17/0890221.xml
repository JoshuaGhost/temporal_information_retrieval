But the experience of working with that teacher remains.</p>
        <p>Teachers who are smart, passionate and knowledgeable, both about their topic and their students, who feel confident and valued and who themselves have been well educated are the key to a nation of well-educated children. If we could spend time, money and, most important, thought on how to create a population of great teachers, we would be a lot closer to having a well-educated nation.</p>
