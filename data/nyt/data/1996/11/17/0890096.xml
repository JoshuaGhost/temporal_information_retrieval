        <p>BRAISED meat dishes are immensely practical. They can be made in one pot and improve when cooked a day or more in advance. They give off comforting, rustic aromas of thyme, rosemary, wine and spices -- the sort of kitchen smells associated with fall.</p>
        <p>A leg of lamb comes out tender and flavorful when braised in white wine with olives and tomatoes. Anchovies chopped and added toward the end of cooking melt into the sauce, giving it another dimension (with none of the harsh taste associated with anchovies). Pork chops do not dry out when braised, and they are delicious cooked in wine and served on a bed of sauteed fennel. In Tuscany, a popular fall dish is rabbit cooked ''the hunter's way'' in a tomato sauce flavored with wine and herbs and dried porcini mushrooms and served over polenta.</p>

        <p>BRAISED meat dishes are immensely practical. They can be made in one pot and improve when cooked a day or more in advance. They give off comforting, rustic aromas of thyme, rosemary, wine and spices -- the sort of kitchen smells associated with fall.</p>
        <p>A leg of lamb comes out tender and flavorful when braised in white wine with olives and tomatoes. Anchovies chopped and added toward the end of cooking melt into the sauce, giving it another dimension (with none of the harsh taste associated with anchovies). Pork chops do not dry out when braised, and they are delicious cooked in wine and served on a bed of sauteed fennel. In Tuscany, a popular fall dish is rabbit cooked ''the hunter's way'' in a tomato sauce flavored with wine and herbs and dried porcini mushrooms and served over polenta.</p>
        <p>In ''From the Tales of Tuscan Women'' by Anna Bianchi (Ecco Press) from which the recipe below is adapted, the author talks of strolling in Torre del Lago Puccini, a town in Versalia named for the composer, with the daughter of one of his neighbors. The neighbor could remember nights when her mother would make extra polenta ''knowing that in some mystical way, the odor would filter across the street through Puccini's window,'' and before long, he would stride through the front door and sit himself down at the big table in the kitchen with the rest of the neighbor's family.</p>
        <p>''And there we would sit for hours,'' she writes, ''eating plate full after plate full, soaking up the sauce with thick slices of bread, and washing it all down with liters of strong red wine.''</p>
        <p>Braised Rabbit With Porcini and Polenta  Total time: 1 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>3 ounces dried porcini mushrooms</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1 medium onion, chopped</p>
        <p>2 ounces prosciutto, minced</p>
        <p>1 whole rabbit cleaned and cut into small pieces</p>
        <p>1 glass dry red wine</p>
        <p>A quarter of teaspoon of dried thyme</p>
        <p>Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1 35-ounce can of Italian tomatoes with the juice</p>
        <p>4 cups coarse-grain polenta</p>
        <p>3 quarts of water.</p>
        <p>1. Soak the mushrooms in warm water for a half-hour, then squeeze them dry, discarding all but two tablespoons of the liquid. Heat the butter in a skillet over medium heat; saute the onion, prosciutto and mushrooms until the onion is lightly browned.</p>
        <p>2. Add the wine, thyme, salt and pepper and cook covered over medium heat for 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, dice the tomatoes and add them to the rabbit. Lower the heat and cook, uncovered for another 30 minutes or until the sauce has thickened somewhat.</p>
        <p>4. In the meantime, make the polenta. Fill a large pot with three quarts of salted water, add the polenta in a steady stream and cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the spoon stands by itself in the center and the polenta pulls away from the sides of the pot. Serve the polenta in large bowls, topped with the rabbit.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Braised Leg of Lamb With Black Olives</p>
        <p>Total time: 2 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>1 3 1/2-pound leg of lamb, boned</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1 onion, chopped</p>
        <p>6 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed</p>
        <p>1 cup canned plum tomatoes with the juice</p>
        <p>8 branches of fresh thyme</p>
        <p>About a cup of dry white wine</p>
        <p>1/4 pound pitted Nicoise olives</p>
        <p>2 anchovy fillets, chopped.</p>
        <p>1. Cut away any loose bits of fat from the lamb. Heat the oil in a heavy casserole. Season the lamb with salt and pepper and brown it on all sides over medium heat.</p>
        <p>2. Remove the lamb from the casserole. Add the onion and cook until soft. Add the garlic, tomatoes and thyme and just enough wine to moisten. Return the lamb to the casserole and cover.</p>
        <p>3. Simmer the lamb over moderate heat for two hours, turning occasionally and moistening with more wine. After an hour and a half, add the olives and anchovies. Cook for another half-hour, basting frequently, until the lamb is tender. Slice the lamb, put the slices on a platter and cover them with the sauce.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Pork Chops Braised In White Wine With Fennel</p>
        <p>Total time: 1 hour</p>
        <p>2 bulbs fennel, tops removed and discarded</p>
        <p>6 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>4 boned double loin pork chops</p>
        <p>2 shallots, chopped</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon toasted fennel seeds</p>
        <p>1 cup dry white wine</p>
        <p>Rosemary sprigs for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Cut the fennel into slices half an inch thick. Steam the slices until tender (about 20 minutes). Heat four tablespoons of the olive oil in the skillet and add the fennel. Season with salt and pepper and cook over moderate heat until the fennel is lightly browned. Put it on a platter and keep it in a warm oven.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, trim the fat from the pork chops and wipe them dry with paper towels. Season them with salt and pepper and brown them in the olive oil. Remove the pork chops from the pan.</p>
        <p>3. Add the shallots, thyme and fennel seeds and cook for two minutes, stirring. Add the wine and return the chops to the pan. Cover and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the chops are cooked but not dried out (they should be pinkish in the middle).</p>
        <p>4. When the chops are cooked, put them on top of the fennel and keep them warm. Reduce the pan juices to a glaze over high heat and spoon the glaze over the chops. Garnish with rosemary sprigs and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Note: This is good served with mashed potatoes.</p>
