        <p>'Contemporary Art in Asia'  'Traditions/Tensions'</p>
        <p>Queens Museum of Art  New York City Building  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  (718) 592-9700  Recommended ages: 4 and up  Through Jan. 5</p>
        <p>The most talked-about piece of art in this three-part exhibition, which is also on view at the Asia Society and the Grey Art Gallery in Manhattan, is a 21-foot-long, yellow nylon inflated-balloon robot from a piece called ''About Being Irritated: Death of the Robot.'' Who is talking about it so much? Children.</p>
        <p>The robot is by Choi Jeong-Hwa, an artist based in Seoul, South Korea, who uses a spectrum of media in his work, from plastic molded animals to food. The robot doesn't eat but it does move, which is what makes it so appealing. But it doesn't move far. This inflated fellow lies on its back and tries to rise by pushing itself up with one hand. Its symbolic meaning involves issues -- Korea's political and social problems -- that children don't need to understand to enjoy the piece. The robot continuously tries to rise, as if doing a sit-up, but always fails.</p>

        <p>'Contemporary Art in Asia'  'Traditions/Tensions'</p>
        <p>Queens Museum of Art  New York City Building  Flushing Meadows-Corona Park  (718) 592-9700  Recommended ages: 4 and up  Through Jan. 5</p>
        <p>The most talked-about piece of art in this three-part exhibition, which is also on view at the Asia Society and the Grey Art Gallery in Manhattan, is a 21-foot-long, yellow nylon inflated-balloon robot from a piece called ''About Being Irritated: Death of the Robot.'' Who is talking about it so much? Children.</p>
        <p>The robot is by Choi Jeong-Hwa, an artist based in Seoul, South Korea, who uses a spectrum of media in his work, from plastic molded animals to food. The robot doesn't eat but it does move, which is what makes it so appealing. But it doesn't move far. This inflated fellow lies on its back and tries to rise by pushing itself up with one hand. Its symbolic meaning involves issues -- Korea's political and social problems -- that children don't need to understand to enjoy the piece. The robot continuously tries to rise, as if doing a sit-up, but always fails.</p>
        <p>Viewers can sit on pillows to watch the robot, which resembles a large-scale superhero, Korean-style. When the museum's docents talk about the piece, they suggest that children contemplate questions like: Who is your favorite superhero and why?</p>
        <p>The museum offers Sunday family art workshops, often related to pieces in the exhibition. These are in session from 1 to 4 P.M. and cost $2. Museum hours are Wednesdays through Fridays, 10 A.M. to 5 P.M.; weekends noon to 5 P.M.; closed Mondays and Tuesdays. Admission is $3 for adults; $1.50 for children 6 and up.</p>
        <p>Little Hands Play Cafe</p>
        <p>433 East Sixth Street  East Village  (212) 388-0957  Recommended ages: 6 months to 8</p>
        <p>The Lower East Side digs children.  A puppet theater at the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center had its debut last month, and now a cafe-cum-play-space for people under (and over) 12 has opened.</p>
        <p>Calling itself the ''funkiest playhouse in town,'' this cafe is like your own home at dinnertime. Indoor play spaces in the city meet the needs of many parents: this one is artier than most, and you don't get the feeling the owners are obsessed with the bottom line.</p>
        <p>Besides health-minded sandwiches, salads and cereals, Little Hands has an attractive wooden play area for toddlers and babies that is meant to resemble a garden. It is stocked with toys and a climbing area leading to a faux castle. Downstairs is a larger playroom, for all ages, with an art table, nylon tunnels and more toys. Twice a day, art and dance or music programs are offered. The latter, in the late afternoon, cost $6 an hour for each child. The art workshops, held earlier in the afternoon, are $4 an hour; for unlimited play upstairs, the fee is $2; unlimited play downstairs, when no workshops are going on, is $4. Children under 1 are free.</p>
        <p>The sandwiches for adults (about $5.50) are enormous. Peanut butter-and-jelly sandwiches are $2; grilled cheese in pita bread, $2. Hours are Mondays through Thursdays, 9 A.M. to 9 P.M.; Fridays and Saturdays, 9 A.M. to 11 P.M., and Sundays, 10 A.M. to 9 P.M.</p>
