        <p>Those are the key features of the winning design in an international competition to develop a waterfront park on the old Mitchell property in the North Fork community.

        <p>A familiar old schooner would sit in dry-docked splendor, its prow forming a gate to the Village of Greenport, L.I., and riders of an antique carousel would have a grand view of the harbor as they reach for the brass ring.</p>
        <p>Those are the key features of the winning design in an international competition to develop a waterfront park on the old Mitchell property in the North Fork community. The winner is James Corner, a professor of landscape architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, village officials announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>The winner, who will receive $10,000, was chosen from some 500 entries by a jury of professionals, village officials said. Professor Corner's design calls for the 140-foot schooner Regina Maris, built in 1908, to rest at the edge of Front Street.</p>
