        <p>Municipal Art Society pres Brendan Sexton letter deplores New York Stock Exchange's plan to expand by building eight-story structure over Broad Street; charges that Exchange is simply erasing public's property rights, and that public landmarks will be 'encapsulated' inside a new building</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>New York City's planning and civic groups were embarrassed to see that the New York Stock Exchange's plan to expand by building an eight-story structure over Broad Street (news article, Oct. 29; letter, Nov. 3) had scooped us, solving our city's problem of too little space at too high rent. Let's just build in the streets.</p>
        <p>Land use regulation was invented largely to deal with the competition between public and private interests produced by scarce real estate and unregulated avarice. The Stock Exchange's proposal promises to resolve the conflict by simply erasing the public's property rights.</p>

        <p>Land use regulation was invented largely to deal with the competition between public and private interests produced by scarce real estate and unregulated avarice. The Stock Exchange's proposal promises to resolve the conflict by simply erasing the public's property rights.</p>
        <p>As one final boon in this cornucopia of public weal, the proposal would protect the facades of the Exchange, the Morgan Guaranty Trust building and Broad Street. This would be accomplished by encapsulating these landmarks inside a new building and giant display case, cutting them off from all mischief that might come from, for instance, use.</p>
