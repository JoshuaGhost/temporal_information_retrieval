        <p>Arizona 83, North Carolina 72</p>
        <p>Arizona, with four players making their first collegiate starts, used a career-high 31 points from the junior Michael Dickerson and 22 from the touted freshman Michael Bibby to beat North Carolina, 83-72, last night in the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic in Springfield, Mass.</p>
        <p>Miles Simon, who was supposed to be the Wildcats' only returning starter from last season, sat out with academic problems. He watched Arizona, ranked 19th in the Associated Press media poll, pull away from a 29-29 halftime tie as Dickerson went 5 for 6 from 3-point range and Bibby scored 16 points.</p>
        <p>The loss ended a streak of 13 consecutive season-opening victories for the Tar Heels (No. 7 A.P.), who last lost an opener in the 1982 Tip-Off Classic against St. John's.</p>
        <p>Indiana 70, Saint Louis 54</p>
        <p>Led by the freshmen A. J. Guyton and Jason Collier, host Indiana defeated Saint Louis to reach the semifinals of the Chase Preseason National Invitation Tournament. Guyton scored 14 points and Collier added 13 for the Hoosiers (3-0), who will meet Evansville on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Evansville 44, Iona 41</p>
        <p>Justin Farley, who sat out Evansville's first game, hit two free throws with 17 seconds left to protect a narrow lead as host Evansville (2-0) beat Iona in the quarterfinals of the Preseason N.I.T.</p>
        <p>Duke 86, Vanderbilt 57</p>
        <p>Steve Wojciechowski and Ricky Price keyed a first-half run as host Duke (No. 10 A.P.) advanced to the semifinals of the Preseason N.I.T. The Blue Devils (2-0) will face the winner of last night's Oklahoma State-Tulsa game.</p>
        <p>Syracuse 106, Winthrop 51</p>
        <p>Otis Hill scored a career-high 23 points and Todd Burgan added 21 as host Syracuse opened its season by humbling Winthrop.</p>
        <p>New Mexico 94, Columbia 56</p>
        <p>Charles Smith scored 26 points, leading the host Lobos (2-0) over Columbia (0-1) in the semifinals of the Lobo Classic.</p>
        <p>IN OTHER GAMES</p>
        <p>Host BOSTON COLLEGE took care of BROWN, 89-72, scoring the first 13 points. . . . Justin Bailey scored 19 points to lead HARTFORD to a 63-62 victory over host YALE in the season opener for both teams. . . . No. 2 KANSAS downed host SANTA CLARA, 76-64.</p>
