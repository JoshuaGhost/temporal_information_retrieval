        <p>Everyone was in love with this beautiful gazelle of an actress, but none of her qualities -- innocence, freshness, unspoiled charm, grace, aristocratic bearing -- seem to entirely explain her popularity. Certainly not innocence, since she often played rather sophisticated and knowing young women, like Holly Golightly. The fresh beauty that everyone responded to was not quite it, either. Elegance comes closer -- that joyous lightness of touch and piquant slenderness that contrasted so tellingly with the heavier, more voluptuous Marilyn, Lana or Ava.</p>
        <p>Audrey was admired for her accomplishments -- poise, grooming, wit, style and a knowledge of foreign languages; she could probably play the piano too. We knew she had studied ballet, though she seldom danced. Her allure was not the boring virtue of girl-next-door types like Doris Day or Sally Field. Like a true princess -- and this was a time of real-life princesses (the not quite convincingly royal Grace of Monaco and the indubitably royal Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret) -- she had an unassailable qualification for our adoration: she was not American.</p>

        <p>Everyone was in love with this beautiful gazelle of an actress, but none of her qualities -- innocence, freshness, unspoiled charm, grace, aristocratic bearing -- seem to entirely explain her popularity. Certainly not innocence, since she often played rather sophisticated and knowing young women, like Holly Golightly. The fresh beauty that everyone responded to was not quite it, either. Elegance comes closer -- that joyous lightness of touch and piquant slenderness that contrasted so tellingly with the heavier, more voluptuous Marilyn, Lana or Ava.</p>
        <p>Audrey was admired for her accomplishments -- poise, grooming, wit, style and a knowledge of foreign languages; she could probably play the piano too. We knew she had studied ballet, though she seldom danced. Her allure was not the boring virtue of girl-next-door types like Doris Day or Sally Field. Like a true princess -- and this was a time of real-life princesses (the not quite convincingly royal Grace of Monaco and the indubitably royal Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret) -- she had an unassailable qualification for our adoration: she was not American.</p>
        <p>Young women in this country knew that they could not ''be'' Audrey Hepburn (and males could not ''have'' her) for one main reason: we were not Continental. Audrey Hepburn focused all our American longing for sophisticated worldliness. Any of us might grow up to be polite and pretty, and we might even become actresses. But nothing could make us into aristocratic Europeans, because we were American teen-agers, doomed by democracy.</p>
        <p>What's more, she was unsoiled by Hollywood. Most of the great stars had scrabbled to the top in a variety of sordid ways, dodging lecherous stepfathers and abusive uncles and negotiating the casting couch. If Audrey had to do any of that, it was not known. On the other hand, if in the classic Freudian opposition of Madonna and whore, she only represented the Madonna, young women would not have admired her so wholeheartedly, for it does not escape any woman, however unconsciously, that the Madonna role is both demanding and thankless.</p>
        <p>The other goddesses -- the Joan Crawfords and Lana Turners -- were interchangeable, expendable, discardable. The other goddesses took pills and tried suicide. Their allure arose not only from their beauty (indispensable) but paradoxically from their off-screen flaws: unwise sexual passions, poor judgment in men, an unnatural lack of sociability (Garbo); outsize seductiveness; even mannish independence, like Katharine Hepburn's.</p>
        <p>Whatever Audrey Hepburn's private life, it did not matter, though nothing that we knew of it disturbed our idea of her either, because her status ultimately derived from her roles in films like ''Roman Holiday,'' ''Charade,'' ''Funny Face,'' ''Sabrina,'' ''Love in the Afternoon'' and ''My Fair Lady.'' In these, she played valuable, prized females who prevailed. Sums had been lavished on her education. Sums had been lavished on her clothes by Balenciaga or Givenchy. The most important thing about her was not that she was ''radiant'' or ''untouched,'' it was that she was valuable and treasured(ital).</p>
        <p>It is a comment on our time that in the latest version of Pygmalion, ''Pretty Woman,'' Julia Roberts, like Audrey in ''My Fair Lady,'' is befriended by a super-rich man who does not value her for her vowels -- she's a whore. In a key scene Julia is watching TV alone in their hotel suite. It's been a day when snooty saleswomen refused to let a girl like her shop in their smart boutique, despite her unlimited clothes allowance. What's on TV? An Audrey Hepburn movie, of course, summarizing for Julia (and the viewer) the entire not-so-subliminal challenge of ''Pretty Woman.'' Aristocratic role model Audrey, exquisite in demure navy dress and white pillbox hat, is rewarding Cary Grant with her delightful smile for what he's just offered her: ''A marriage license!'' Can Julia Roberts learn to be like Audrey Hepburn -- beautiful Audrey with her big eyes, long neck, demure smile and perfect wardrobe? The very next day, Julia will buy some ladylike clothes and develop a new consciousness about forks. She'll never quite master them, though. When Audrey played Eliza Doolittle, she could not conceal that, deep down, she already knew about the forks.</p>
