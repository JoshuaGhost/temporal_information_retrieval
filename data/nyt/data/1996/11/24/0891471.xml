        <p>IN THE 1960'S A HANDFUL OF REBELLIOUS young artists left their mark on the landscape -- both geographical and cultural -- by making the first earthworks. These site-specific cuts, mounds, holes and jetties, created in places like the Mojave Desert in California or Massacre Dry Lake, Nev. -- far from Eurocentric culture and the world of museums and art galleries -- represent some of the most radical gestures in 20th-century art.</p>
        <p>The earthworks raised many new issues, including conservation; a work exposed to the elements undergoes major transformations sooner or later. But since earthworks are not in the public eye and because artists sometimes waver between abandoning and maintaining them, a quarter of a century later it is still not clear what will become of them and what, if any, preservation measures will be taken.</p>

        <p>IN THE 1960'S A HANDFUL OF REBELLIOUS young artists left their mark on the landscape -- both geographical and cultural -- by making the first earthworks. These site-specific cuts, mounds, holes and jetties, created in places like the Mojave Desert in California or Massacre Dry Lake, Nev. -- far from Eurocentric culture and the world of museums and art galleries -- represent some of the most radical gestures in 20th-century art.</p>
        <p>The earthworks raised many new issues, including conservation; a work exposed to the elements undergoes major transformations sooner or later. But since earthworks are not in the public eye and because artists sometimes waver between abandoning and maintaining them, a quarter of a century later it is still not clear what will become of them and what, if any, preservation measures will be taken.</p>
        <p>The principal artists who made works in and from the earth -- Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, Dennis Oppenheim -- considered the passage of time an integral part of their projects. Unlike traditional works intended to last, art in the land is paradoxical: monumental yet intrinsically frail.</p>
        <p>Since many earthworks are difficult to reach, the public has known them primarily through photography, text and film, their scale and tremendous physical presence curiously diluted. And because some works are disappearing through erosion, whether by intent or neglect, the documentation may be all that remains, a predicament that in itself raises important issues.</p>
        <p>''Photography and the media have become acceptable levels of reality for our culture,'' says Ronald Jones, a New York artist and professor at the School of Art at Yale University. ''But when the earthworks are gone, the important difference between representation and experience in the first person will be simply a story to tell.''</p>
        <p>Despite the anti-establishment origins of earthworks, a few institutions have stepped in to protect them. Probably the best-known earthwork is ''The Lightning Field'' (1977), Mr. De Maria's precise grid of 400 stainless steel poles on a 21-square-mile stretch of desert near Quemado, N.M. It is owned by the Dia Foundation, which organizes trips to the site. Dia's patronage enabled the artist to create the work and, since then, has maintained it, at a cost of $50,000 a year, according to the foundation's director, Michael Govan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heizer's ''Double Negative'' (1969), two 100-foot-long cuts facing each other across a canyon in Mormon Mesa, Nev., came out of the same desire to make art outside the gallery system. But since it was donated to the Los Angeles museum in 1985 by the earthworks patron Virginia Dwan, whose gallery in New York City supported these artists, the Heizer work has entered the realm of the art institution.</p>
        <p>''It was a very unusual thing to be offered, and it is slightly ironic to have an earthwork wind up in a museum collection,'' says Kerry Brougher, a curator at the museum. ''But, conceptually, it lends a stamp of approval and brings attention to it.'' The museum arranges trips to the piece and has agreed to follow the artist's instructions regarding any future conservation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Heizer is pleased with the decision. ''It's a huge statement that a museum would take a piece like that, but I don't want anyone to touch it,'' he says over a crackly radio phone at his home in a remote part of his native Nevada. Although the piece has been well documented in photographs, Mr. Heizer says, it should be experienced in person. The edges of ''Double Negative'' have softened a bit, but otherwise it is much as it was in 1969.</p>
        <p>The fate of Robert Smithson's work is less clear. Despite his enormous influence on contemporary art, he is neither widely known to the public nor heavily supported by cultural institutions. The most poignant example of this indifference concerns ''Amarillo Ramp,'' Smithson's last work (he died in 1973 at age 35 in a plane crash while surveying the site). The project was conceived and staked out by him but built posthumously by his widow, the artist Nancy Holt.</p>
        <p>A long, adventurous trip is required to reach the ramp, situated on the Amarillo, Tex., cattle ranch of Stanley Marsh 3d, who occasionally allowed artists to work on his property. ''Amarillo Ramp'' was completed as a 160-foot-wide crescent of red shale sitting in a cracked, dry lake bed or, if the basin was filled, rising from the water's surface. Anyone familiar with this image is in for a surprise. The ramp has eroded down to a semicircular lump and is so covered with scrub that it is indistinguishable from all the other lumps on the vast prairie.</p>
        <p>It's hard to say what Smithson would have thought of this deterioration. His contribution to art and to the intellectual discourse of the 1960's has made him one of this century's most original and sophisticated thinkers. A keen observer of postwar industrial culture, Smithson preferred sites like abandoned quarries or gigantic airport runways to the untouched backdrops favored by other earthworks artists. Smithson's writings, laced with dry humor and a penchant for dialectics, continue to be relevant today.</p>
        <p>Smithson was especially preoccupied with the idea of entropy, which he saw manifested in the landscape of the late 20th century, where suburban sprawl and the ugly side of industry look like ''ruins in reverse.'' The trouble is, no one can agree on what that means for the earthworks.</p>
        <p>''When things broke down and devolved, Smithson found that equally interesting,'' says Ms. Dwan. ''But seeing these works is important, not just for the scale but for the spirit of the thing.'' Caroline Jones, whose new book, ''Machine in the Studio,'' discusses Smithson at length, disagrees. ''I would like to think of Smithson just letting 'Amarillo Ramp' go,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Unlike other earthworks artists who used photography principally for documentation, Smithson's photographs were an integral part of the experience of the work. ''Spiral Jetty'' (1970), an enormous curl of rocks in the Great Salt Lake in Utah, can be visited in person, although most people have seen it only in photos or through Smithson's own film and essays. ''Even if there wasn't any 'Spiral Jetty,' it would still exist,'' Ms. Jones says.</p>
        <p>SMITHSON ALLOWED room for permutations but ''did intend his work to be permanent,'' Ms. Holtsays. For ''Partially Buried Woodshed,'' an earth-covered shack on the campus of Kent State University in Ohio, Smithson insisted that the university take out an insurance policy so maintenance workers would not destroy it accidentally. (Eventually arson and natural deterioration wore the work down to its foundations.) For ''Broken Circle/Spiral Hill,'' in an abandoned Dutch quarry, Smithson had left instructions that weeds on the sculpture be removed and that the sand jetty that is part of the sculpture be shored up with wood beams.</p>
        <p>In the case of ''Spiral Jetty,'' Great Salt Lake rose to unexpected heights, submerging the sculpture from 1972 until last year. As the lake began receding, a salt-encrusted spiral became visible. According to Robert Hobbs, who wrote a book on Smithson's sculpture, the artist would have built up the spiral if it had remained underwater too long. Ms. Holt, who controls the artist's estate and has a long-term lease on the jetty's land, acts as a kind of guardian. ''I would always make sure that there would be an entity to take care of it, even after I am gone,'' she says. But neither Ms. Holt nor the John Weber Gallery, which represents the estate, have any control over ''Amarillo Ramp.'' According to Mr. Marsh's office, which arranges access to the ramp, visits have waned through the years and there are no plans to restore the ramp.</p>
        <p>Most museums have been slow to respond to earthworks and to Smithson in particular. ''The museums have been negligent with regards to work in the landscape,'' Mr. Weber says. He adds, however, that he has never really offered ''Spiral Jetty'' to anybody. ''Because I would have a hard time putting a price on it,'' he says.</p>
        <p>While some earthworks are insured, Smithson's are not, although they could be quite valuable (a small Smithson sculpture is valued at $400,000). Robert Storr, curator of contemporary art at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, which owns a number of Smithson pieces, says his museum has never been offered an earthwork. ''And I'm not sure I would be for it,'' he says. ''It's too big a commitment financially, and we have a broad range of things to look after.''</p>
        <p>He adds: ''A lot of people dealing with ephemeral works hedge at the last minute and are not quite willing to let nature run its course. That's an understandable response, but I also think it may deprive the works of their poetry and meaning. The work was made to remind us of the small position we have in the natural world.''</p>
