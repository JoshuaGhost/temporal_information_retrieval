        <p>Reading about how the British knew that the Nazis were killing Eastern European Jews as early as 1941 (front page, Nov. 19) brought back memories of the day my father came home to tell us what had happened to his family in Slonim, Belarus. The few survivors had managed to get the news of the mass killings to the United States. His mother, sisters and my cousins were dead.</p>

        <p>Reading about how the British knew that the Nazis were killing Eastern European Jews as early as 1941 (front page, Nov. 19) brought back memories of the day my father came home to tell us what had happened to his family in Slonim, Belarus. The few survivors had managed to get the news of the mass killings to the United States. His mother, sisters and my cousins were dead.</p>
        <p>When the war ended and I grew to adulthood, I often wondered why so many politicians, heads of state and ordinary citizens contended that they did not know what I, a child in Brooklyn, had known in 1941. They did indeed know.</p>
