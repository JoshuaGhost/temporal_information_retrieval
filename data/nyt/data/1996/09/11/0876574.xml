        <p>Carrie K Monahan letter disputes John Cronin's Sept 7 Op-Ed article on threat to fish from hyrdoelectric plants (M)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Fish versus the electric company. That's the choice posed by John Cronin (Op-Ed, Sept. 7), who frames the debate as the environmentalists versus the big, greedy power companies. That makes for a good headline -- ''The Cost of Electricity Per Species'' -- but not necessarily good public policy.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Cronin is mainly concerned about power plants that use water for cooling, the narrow fish-versus-electricity debate also clouds the future of America's hydroelectric plants. Hydroelectricity, a clean, abundant, renewable resource, represents 10 percent of our nation's power generation. In the next 15 years, about one-quarter of that hydropower will come up for Federal relicensing.</p>

        <p>Fish versus the electric company. That's the choice posed by John Cronin (Op-Ed, Sept. 7), who frames the debate as the environmentalists versus the big, greedy power companies. That makes for a good headline -- ''The Cost of Electricity Per Species'' -- but not necessarily good public policy.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Cronin is mainly concerned about power plants that use water for cooling, the narrow fish-versus-electricity debate also clouds the future of America's hydroelectric plants. Hydroelectricity, a clean, abundant, renewable resource, represents 10 percent of our nation's power generation. In the next 15 years, about one-quarter of that hydropower will come up for Federal relicensing.</p>
        <p>Fish are an issue with hydro plants, too. But focusing mainly on fish ignores the interest of other stakeholders in hydroelectricity. They include residential and industrial consumers of electricity, who want reliable and affordable energy; those who use the lakes behind the dams for boating and camping; local communities that depend on those recreational activities, and everyone concerned about the air we breathe.</p>
        <p>In the relicensing process, these stakeholders need to have their voices heard to insure a balanced policy for operating hydro facilities. The issues are complex but manageable if all stakeholders are represented, negotiate in good faith and make honest efforts at compromise.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Cronin argues, fish are a legitimate concern. But so are the interests of the many people who benefit from hydroelectricity. Listening to the voices of a few isn't the way to make good decisions for the many.</p>
