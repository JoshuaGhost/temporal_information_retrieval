        <p>Can a black woman, a Caribbean immigrant who has lived in Italy for four years, be a symbol of Italian female beauty?</p>
        <p>If she is Denny Mendez, 18, who was crowned Miss Italy 1996 over the weekend, the answer is yes, although the question is still under heated debate.</p>
        <p>''How did a beauty contest turn into a mini-national psychodrama?'' the newspaper La Repubblica asked this morning, in one of the dozens of commentaries that have used Miss Mendez's victory to analyze racial tolerance in Italy, the relative nature of beauty and, above all, what it means to be Italian.</p>
        <p>The controversy began days before the final competition on Saturday. Two members of the Miss Italy jury were suspended for saying that Miss Mendez, as a black woman, could not represent Italian beauty.</p>
        <p>One, Alba Parietti, a television announcer who was later reinstated, defended herself against charges of racism, questioning whether China would accept a Miss China without almond-shaped eyes, or if a non-black African could become Miss Senegal.</p>
        <p>In what many say was a backlash of sympathy, Miss Mendez swept to victory in the judges' vote on Saturday, buoyed by a third of the call-in vote, which was phoned in by over a million of the 13 million Italians -- 81 percent of the viewing public -- who were watching the pageant live.</p>
        <p>Since then, Miss Mendez, a naturalized Italian citizen who moved here from the Dominican Republic when her mother married an Italian, has held her own.</p>
        <p>''I know that I don't represent Italian beauty, but they elected me, so what am I supposed to do -- refuse?'' she told one newspaper.</p>
        <p>But at the core of the continuing debate is Italy's changing identity -- from a relatively homogenous society (although that too is debatable) to a one that in recent years has accepted a growing population of non-European immigrants.</p>
        <p>Even Prime Minister Romano Prodi had a comment on the Miss Italy results. ''Italy is changing,'' he said. ''We also have black soccer players, and now this too is a sign.''</p>
        <p>Officially, there are just under one million foreigners living in Italy, a country with a population of 56 million -- although that figure does not include either naturalized Italians like Miss Mendez, or the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants here. Blacks are a small minority of immigrants, most of whom come from North Africa, Albania or the Balkans.</p>
        <p>Compared with Germany, with its long tradition of ''guest workers,'' or France or Britain, which have a history of taking in immigrants from former colonies, the number of foreign-born in Italy is relatively low. But as commentators have pointed out, Italy, which not long ago was a country of emigrants, is having trouble adapting to the notion that it has become a land of immigrants.</p>
        <p>''Italy became a land of immigration without ever deciding to, and, in some cases, without ever wanting to, ''Guido Bolaffi wrote in La Repubblica on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Some commentators have suggested that the vote to crown Miss Mendez was an attempt by the Italian judges and viewers to go out of their way to prove to themselves and others that Italy, too, is ready to accept a multi-ethnic identity.</p>
        <p>''The contest ended under a sort of blackmail,'' said Enrico Mentana, a judge who is a producer of one of Italy's main television news programs and who voted for another contestant. ''Not to elect Denny would mean looking like a Class-B country.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mentana argued that Miss Mendez was neither the most beautiful contestant, nor the most beautiful foreign immigrant. ''She is exotic,'' he said, ''like the women whom Italians who spend their vacations in Cuba find attractive.''</p>
        <p>But others have noted that few Italians complained about Fiona May, a British black athlete who won a silver medal competing for Italy in the long jump at the Olympic Games in Atlanta. Nor, they noted, do they challenge George Weah, a black Liberian with a French passport, who plays for the AC Milan soccer team.</p>
        <p>Commenting on the furor over the Miss Italy case, Gianni Vattimo, an Italian philosopher, said the test was not over whether Miss Mendez won the Miss Italy title, but over whether she was allowed to compete.</p>
        <p>''To dismiss a black soccer player because he is black is racist,'' he told the leftist newspaper L'Unita. ''To get annoyed because he plays well is less significant.''</p>
