        <p>MUCH of the fine print on the back of an air ticket concerns the Warsaw Convention, a 1929 agreement that governs many aspects of international flights, particularly liability in the event of a fatal accident.</p>
        <p>In 1966, the top liability limit was  set at $75,000, but with time and inflation, the figure has become unrealistically low. Efforts to raise it  by amending the Warsaw Convention have failed in Congress, which could not agree to ratify changes.</p>
        <p>But award limits may be removed by another means, as early as Nov. 1, if the Department of Transportation approves plans submitted to it by a group of world airlines.</p>
        <p>As it exists now, the $75,000 limit does not apply if the airline can be proved grossly negligent, a provision that is the source of tortuous trials.  Some relatives of passengers lost in the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 when it strayed into Russian air space and was shot down in 1983 still have cases in court. Others received $75,000. This history means the limit is acutely in mind as the investigation of the crash of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 on July 17 goes forward.</p>
        <p>If effective Nov. 1, the new policy would not be retroactive, meaning that the T.W.A. liability limit would remain at $75,000 a passenger. But experts say T.W.A. might find it easier to waive that limit than to explain how three months could make such a difference in the bereaved families' financial well-being. John M. McDonald, a spokesman for T.W.A., said that the line could not comment on this possibility so long as the cause of the crash remained under investigation.</p>
        <p>Virtually all relatives of air-crash victims file lawsuits, according to Gerard R. Lear of Speiser, Krause, Madole &amp; Lear in Washington and Lee S. Kreindler of Kreindler &amp; Kreindler in New York, two lawyers expert in the area. Sometimes, Mr. Lear said, the airline's insurance company will offer a settlement of $75,000 or more even before a legal filing, but Mr. Lear said that a plaintiff still needed a lawsuit to guard against expiration of the two-year statute of limitations after which no suit can be filed.</p>
        <p>As many as 30 percent of the cases  actually go to trial to prove damages, usually based on income lost to the families, if airline offers are considered too low.</p>
        <p>A Move Toward Change</p>
        <p>With efforts to amend the Warsaw Convention foundering, about two years ago, most of the world's airlines took steps toward ending the ceiling and letting passengers' families collect any damages they could prove they were entitled to in court, which can be as high as several million dollars. The awards might come through court trials, or through settlements as trials approached, but in either case, this would avert protracted proceedings over gross negligence, technically called ''willful misconduct.'' The Department of Transportation, in deploring such lengthy trials, said that they created ''particular hardship for those most in need of prompt compensatory awards.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kreindler said that the airlines began to see that such protracted disputes were damaging their reputations and creating ill will. The long suits are also costly to the airlines in dollars. Indeed, Hans Ephraimson-Abt of Ridgewood, N.J., whose daughter died in the downing of K.A.L. 007, said he believed that the Korean airline's legal costs now exceeded the amount it would have paid in settlements of all sorts. Mr. Ephraimson-Abt, who has not yet received any money in the case, which is still pending in New York, frequently acts as a spokesman for victims' families.</p>
        <p>Discussions have been held by the airlines, the aerospace industry, the Government, the American Trial Lawyers Association, the airlines' underwriters and the families of victims, with the United States Department of Transportation granting the airlines exemption from antitrust prosecution for the purpose.</p>
        <p>Late last year, the airlines agreed upon the goal of removing limits at a meeting of the International Air Transport Association in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At the end of July, the statements prepared by this organization were submitted to the Department of Transportation for approval. At this writing, 56 world airlines have signed the declaration of intention.</p>
        <p>Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said the agreements would be reviewed carefully to be sure they met the goal of ''reforming a system that has taken far too long to fix.''</p>
        <p>Removing the Ceiling</p>
        <p>The nub of the agreements removes all ceilings from awards made by courts, or settlements approved by courts, on the basis of damages proved by the plaintiffs:  loss of a wage earner's support, for example. A ceiling of $146,000 is established in cases where the airline demonstrates that it is wholly blameless.</p>
        <p>Four organizations have commented on the plan. The Aerospace Industries Association, which opposed Congressional amendment of the Warsaw Convention, supports this, as does the International Chamber of Commerce. The Association of Trial Lawyers of America would prefer that the United States withdraw from the Warsaw Convention, but supports approval of the plan as a step forward. The Victims Families' Associations considers the new proposals inadequate. It finds the $146,000 ceiling too low, and most of all, it wants American citizens and residents always to be able to take their cases against foreign airlines to American courts, and this is not embodied in the new proposals.</p>
        <p>The Warsaw Convention lists four jurisdictions where airlines may be sued: the domicile or the main place of business of the carrier -- usually the same -- the place where the ticket was sold, or the destination of the trip. Since most international tickets are for round trips, the families association says, the destination of the trip is likely to be the place where the ticket was bought.</p>
        <p>American companies can always be sued in American courts, the families association points out, but this is not true of foreign carriers, which resist responding in American courts, and do not need to under the Warsaw Convention if the ticket was bought in another country for a round trip to a foreign city. The trial lawyers' wish to abandon the Warsaw Convention arises from their eagerness for a new ''fifth jurisdiction,'' the residence of the passenger.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ephraimson-Abt outlines several situations where an American family could not sue in the United States. In one, a college student studying in Europe is seized with homesickness at Christmas and buys a round-trip ticket on a foreign airline to fly home for the holidays and is killed en route. The Warsaw Convention would not require this case to go to an American court.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Department of Transportation would not comment on whether it was going to approve the agreement or what it would do about airlines that do not accept it. In the past airlines that have not signed international airline agreements have been told that they may not land in the United States, or that if they do land, they will be treated as if they had signed the agreements anyway.</p>
