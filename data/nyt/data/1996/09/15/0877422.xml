        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>With more people swapping computers and attache cases for utensils and haute cuisine (''Out of the Rat Race and Into the Kitchen,'' Living Arts, Sept. 11), America is on the path to becoming a nation of cooks.</p>
        <p>People dissatisfied with dull corporate and technological careers are turning to the kitchen for solace, creative fulfillment and work satisfaction. It will only be a matter of time before we begin to see physicians, who are becoming dissatisfied with managed care, moving from hospital to kitchen. This may well be a plus for the public, since not only is there a surplus of physicians, but in these days of food-borne infections, it will be reassuring to know that, yes, there is a doctor in the house.</p>
        <p>There is another reason for this parade to the stove. An increasing number of highly trained technologists can no longer find employment in their expertise since higher-paying jobs have been moving overseas. These future chefs are looking to the kitchen for substitute employment since they realize that while it is possible for companies to move many of the software-related jobs to countries like India, it would be difficult to transfer the preparing of a souffle to Mexico.</p>
        <p>I can visualize an America in which food preparation is the only remaining industry and we are all cooking for one another.</p>
