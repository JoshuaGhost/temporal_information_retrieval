        <p>When Congressional Republicans barred Federally financed lawyers three months ago from suing the Government on behalf of large groups of poor clients, both the lawyers and their opponents predicted stark consequences.</p>

        <p>When Congressional Republicans barred Federally financed lawyers three months ago from suing the Government on behalf of large groups of poor clients, both the lawyers and their opponents predicted stark consequences.</p>
        <p>Some Democrats warned that if the Legal Services Corporation, which since 1974 has represented the poor in civil matters, could not hold on to its class action lawsuits or bring new ones, thousands of people would lose hard-won rights and benefits. From the Republican standpoint, liberals would lose one of their best weapons for promoting left-wing social policies.</p>
        <p>Both were wrong. For the moment, at least, the legal landscape remains undisturbed, despite a brief sandstorm from an insurgent New York office. All but 5 of Legal Services' 630 class action cases have been settled or handed off to other counsel.</p>
        <p>Alan Houseman, a Legal Services lawyer for 20 years, said that losing the right to bring the large-scale lawsuits had to be placed in perspective: ''There's an unfortunate notion in Legal Services that only experts like themselves can litigate these kinds of cases,'' said Mr. Houseman, who now runs the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington. ''But there's a broad range of public interest programs around the country that don't take Federal money that can do them. And we haven't even really begun to tap the private bar.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers for the poor have used class actions as a cost-effective means to spell out rights or enforce regulations for thousands of people. In New York City, for example, a Legal Services class action lawsuit brought wheelchair-accessible entrances to buses and subway stations. Pending cases seek to press Arizona to speed collection of child support payments from parents and to redress discrimination in a Brooklyn housing project.</p>
        <p>But the tactic, which typically involves years of litigation and many pounds of documents, became a focus of Republicans, who contend that Legal Services is run by liberal lawyers whose lawsuits are intended to change social policy.</p>
        <p>''There were so many class action lawsuits that I thought went beyond the pale,'' said Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who led a fight to abolish Legal Services.</p>
        <p>This spring, Congress made the financing of Legal Services contingent on a raft of restrictions, including the end of class actions. From now on, said Congress, which gave the agency $278 million, down from $400 million the previous year, the lawyers must stick to their standard diet: 1.6 million individual disputes involving Medicaid, housing, family farm debts and domestic violence.</p>
        <p>Alexander Forger, a Manhattan lawyer and president of Legal Services, said he regretted the loss of the class action at a time when spending has been sharply cut. ''We have less money, and a decreasing ability to reach an ever-growing number of eligible clients,'' he said. ''But I think we have stabilized for now.''</p>
        <p>So far, the biggest impact seems to have been felt by the lawyers themselves, who had ethical obligations to their cases and could not withdraw without the permission of a judge.  Throughout the summer, they performed remarkable letter-of-the-law contortions. One Legal Services lawyer became a solo practitioner one day a week to work, unpaid, on his class action. Many resigned outright from Legal Services to take their cases to poverty law programs that do not receive Federal support.</p>
        <p>''Leaving was very difficult,'' said Jane Greengold Stevens, a Brooklyn lawyer who had been with Legal Services for 27 years. ''But I didn't want to work in a situation where I wasn't able to offer my clients all the range of remedies they should have.'' Ms. Stevens took seven class action cases to Brooklyn Law School, where she is now an instructor.</p>
        <p>Other lawyers found substitute counsel from the private bar. In Oregon, Washington, Vermont, Maine and Connecticut, poverty law programs banded together, redistributed their files, and emerged as new entities, with those taking Federal funds now representing only individuals, and others with state and local money picking up the class actions.</p>
        <p>A few lawyers tried to keep their class actions within Legal Services, a move that many feared would blow up the fragile agreement with Congress. Last month, the Washington leadership of Legal Services went to court to block efforts by New York's Legal Services for the Elderly to retain two class action cases.</p>
        <p>The efforts of Jonathan Weiss, the director of Legal Services for the Elderly, to fight the restrictions,  which he argued would violate his duty to his clients, angered many in the legal services world. Supervisors in New York and Washington were so furious that his office came within a day of being shut down. But Mr. Weiss, a poverty lawyer since the 1960's, maintains that the Legal Services Corporation made a Faustian bargain, selling the ability of its lawyers to do their jobs fully in exchange for temporary survival. Given that the Republican platform recommends ending the program, he asked, why not go down fighting?</p>
        <p>''Either you believe that poor people have a right to a lawyer or you don't,'' Mr. Weiss said. ''But if you do, then poor people certainly don't have a right to just half a lawyer.''</p>
        <p>A Federal judge in Manhattan ordered new lawyers to be substituted in one of the lawsuits from Mr. Weiss's office, which seeks the speedy replacement of Social Security payments for recipients whose checks have been lost or stolen.</p>
        <p>But a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan allowed Legal Services for the Elderly to remain, at least for now, with a second case, which is in a monitoring phase of a settlement. That lawsuit, brought on behalf of homebound patients who are unable to come to court for Medicaid hearings, created the right to a hearing over the telephone or even at home.</p>
        <p>To lawyers like Valerie J. Bogart, who shepherded that case, the ban  means that she will not be able to reach the kind of client typically affected by her work: the old, the frail -- people like Thomasina Wheeler, who did not know she could turn to a lawyer. Ms. Wheeler, a quadriplegic Queens woman sent home from the institution where she had lived for 27 years, was denied a motorized stretcher by Medicaid. She asked for a court hearing. Incapable of attending, she sent a health care aide, who was not allowed to speak for her. Unknown to Ms. Wheeler, Ms. Bogart's class action for patients who could not get to court was nearing settlement. The lawyer received a list of patients, contacted Ms. Wheeler and got her a telephone hearing and her stretcher.</p>
        <p>Under the new regulations, Ms. Bogart could bring such a challenge, but a ruling would affect only the individual client. A class action she won this spring, for example, lifting the cap of four hours of home health care aide service for Medicaid patients, affected about 20,000 people.</p>
        <p>''Without the class action, I won't have the ammunition to make the city sit down at the bargaining table with me,'' Ms. Bogart said.</p>
        <p>Although Legal Services was able to disburse its cases, some critics  are not mollified. Mr. Burton said if private money can provide services for the poor, the Government should not have to use taxpayers' money to support Legal Services. ''If we keep the Republican majority,'' he said, ''there will be a real fight over Legal Services in the future.''</p>
        <p>The organizations that picked up Legal Services' cases say the cost has been great. To accept a dozen Legal Services lawsuits, the Legal Aid Society of New York had to turn away $1.5 million in Federal funds.</p>
        <p>Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York University Law School and a former legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said Legal Services' ability to get rid of its class actions did not mean there were plenty of lawyers to take on the legal burdens of the poor.</p>
        <p>''It's like a blanket on a winter night,'' he said. ''You can always pull it to cover one part of you, but what about the others? For every case they've pulled in a new lawyer, someone else won't get serviced.''</p>
