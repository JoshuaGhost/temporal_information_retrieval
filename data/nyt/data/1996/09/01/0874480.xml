        <p>While watching the recent Olympics on television, I was often reminded of a great American painting that dates from the golden age of pure sportsmanship. It was an age in which neither hype nor huckster had made its debut. Artificial aids to performance had never been heard of. As for endorsements, neither cap nor shirt, shorts nor shoes had ever borne a brand name.</p>
        <p>The painting in question, ''The Champion Single Sculls,'' is the summation and apotheosis of the kind of American plain dealing that made this country loved, admired and envied worldwide. Though normally in the Metropolitan Museum and therefore easily accessible to New Yorkers, it is at present on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington as a major element in the exhibition ''Thomas Eakins: The Rowing Pictures,'' on view through Sept. 29.</p>

        <p>While watching the recent Olympics on television, I was often reminded of a great American painting that dates from the golden age of pure sportsmanship. It was an age in which neither hype nor huckster had made its debut. Artificial aids to performance had never been heard of. As for endorsements, neither cap nor shirt, shorts nor shoes had ever borne a brand name.</p>
        <p>The painting in question, ''The Champion Single Sculls,'' is the summation and apotheosis of the kind of American plain dealing that made this country loved, admired and envied worldwide. Though normally in the Metropolitan Museum and therefore easily accessible to New Yorkers, it is at present on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington as a major element in the exhibition ''Thomas Eakins: The Rowing Pictures,'' on view through Sept. 29.</p>
        <p>As a show, it has both sharp focus and high definition. Its subject throughout is competitive oarsmanship at a high level, and it consists of exactly nine paintings, two watercolors and a group of perspective drawings. All of them date from the period between 1871 and 1874 when Eakins was still in his late 20's and had recently returned to his native Philadelphia after three and a half years of dedicated study in Paris. Eakins had learned from Jean-Leon Gerome in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts that painting could be an exact science in which nothing was left to chance and from which all trace of manual effort could be expunged.</p>
        <p>While still in Paris in 1867, Eakins had heard of the first-ever single-scull championship race on the Schuylkill River, which was no more than a few blocks from the Eakins house on Mount Vernon Street. The winner, Max Schmitt, was a young lawyer who had been a friend of his since childhood. Huge crowds had watched the race from every possible vantage point. Nobody paid to see it, and nobody got paid, either openly or on the sly, for winning it.</p>
        <p>Rowing at that time had a strong moral overtone. In competitive oarsmanship there was no place for sneaky or equivocal behavior. Straightforwardness was fundamental,  and as one enthusiast had lately written, ''Excellence as an oarsman is wholly inconsistent with dissipation or excess of any nature.''</p>
        <p>For a young painter who wanted to make his mark, Schmitt-the-straight-arrow was the great subject of the day. In France, Eakins had heard talk of the positivist philosopher Hippolyte Taine, who believed that great works of art should reflect both the essentials of their period and its essential human types.</p>
        <p>In 1868, Eakins had written to his father that the painter's job was to specify what time it was in the painting, what month it was and where the weather was heading. He should also specify ''what kind of people are there, and what they are doing, and why they are doing it.''</p>
        <p>That was Eakins's objective in ''The Champion Single Sculls,'' and he achieved every bit of it in a way that, to quote from Helen A. Cooper, the organizer of the show, ''had no precedent in fine art.'' This was not a formulaic ''sporting picture.'' It was an image refined and perfected, accurate in its every detail and owing nothing to the conventions and short cuts of the popular print.</p>
        <p>It was with this painting that Eakins made his re-entry into the Philadelphia art world in April 1871, a bare nine months after his return to this country. His friend Max Schmitt naturally had pride of place in the picture. But he is not seen in the heat of competition, as are the other fine oarsmen in this show. He is shown at a moment of total relaxation on the Schuylkill.</p>
        <p>As Eakins had watched Schmitt beat out three rivals over a three-mile course in October 1870, he could certainly have shown the oarsman as he blasted his way along the course. This is what he did with the Biglin brothers, a pair of formidable competitors. He painted them in close-up, with every last ligament done to perfection. He also showed how skillfully they dealt with the hazards of the course and the maneuvers of their rivals. Those paintings of the Biglins in action have a terrible immediacy.</p>
        <p>BUT IN ''CHAMPION SINGLE  Sculls,'' Schmitt takes it easy. His race is won, and he can sit in his boat with his oars feathered and his right hand at rest by his side. Drifting at center stage, he looks up toward Eakins.</p>
        <p>Neither man wanted a celebrity portrait. Eakins wanted Schmitt to be simply the most important element in a collective portrait of contemporary life, in which time present and time past become one beneath a huge and halcyon sky.</p>
        <p>As to why Eakins should have done this, Mrs. Cooper, who is curator of American paintings and sculptures at the Yale University Art Gallery, has all the answers. To begin with, the painting is not a transcription of something actually seen. It is a planned confection, worked up in the studio but based on perspective and other drawings that were worked out to the last fraction of an inch.</p>
        <p>Eakins began with the time of day (5 P.M.), the month (a remembered October)  and the weather (clear, with a glassy stillness on the broad river that allowed mirrored reflections to linger).</p>
        <p>Standing back from the scene, and a little above it, he opened it up, both ahead and sideways. Pertinent details turned up in pertinent places, filling in piece by piece the overall report that he wanted to present. Far behind Schmitt, a strikingly unathletic boat inches its way along. Mrs. Cooper points out that its two rowers and its coxswain, in old-fashioned Quaker garb, speak like the boat itself for an earlier day. In the far distance a spunky little steamboat makes fun of their labors. Where two bridges overlap above the river, Mrs. Cooper distinguishes the ancient Girard Avenue Bridge from its upstart neighbor, the Connection Bridge, which is the servant of the railroad. Fashions in real estate are also mapped with care.</p>
        <p>And then there is Eakins himself, rowing a little boat that bears his name upon its stern. If he is clearly struggling with the journey toward the opposite bank, that may be a metaphor for the difficulties (elsewhere so skillfully concealed) of his profession.</p>
        <p>This great painting is the American precursor of Georges Seurat's ''Sunday on la Grande Jatte,'' which was finished in 1886. But whereas Seurat's intentions remain enigmatic to this day, Eakins in his every touch of the brush was the American plain dealer in excelsis. There is no faking in his rowing pictures, and Schmitt would no more pretend to be warming up for a race than he would go around looking for endorsements. Everything in this painting is straightforwardness itself, once we know how to look at it.</p>
        <p>By a happy chance, the Corcoran Gallery, down the road, has, through next Sunday, an exhibition devoted primarily to another key work by Eakins, his ''Swimming,'' which was acquired not long ago by the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth. Dated 1885 and formerly known as ''The Swimming Hole,'' this is a tableau of six naked men, some swimming, others sunning themselves.</p>
        <p>As to what prompted it, speculation has recently run free, with results discussed at length in the catalogue by ranking scholars in the field. Eakins did not see why naked men should not have a natural place in art, just as they do in life. But Philadelphia in the 1880's was not ready for that.</p>
        <p>This show, initiated by Doreen Bolger, once of the Corcoran and now director of the Art Museum in the Rhode Island School of Design, allows the visitor to study this whole question afresh, in the light of oil studies and other related material. In concert with the ''Rowing Pictures,'' it makes a long and rewarding day for the Eakins enthusiast.  ART VIEW</p>
