        <p>Since Sandi Cote and Bobbi Whitacre opened their hilltop Village Green Grocer in Manchester, Vt., four years ago, it has become a gourmet's haven in a land of the stubborn Yankee tastebuds.</p>
        <p>''Cooking salmon tonight?'' Ms. Cote recently asked as she filled a shopper's request for fresh dill, reaching between the buckets of cilantro, rosemary, thyme, rosemary and mint behind the counter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cote, a former computer systems analyst, and Ms. Whitacre, a former accountant, left their jobs in Washington in 1990 to move to Vermont and make quilts. When that business failed, they set up a cart outside the Grand Union supermarket in Manchester and sold local produce.</p>
        <p>In 1992, they moved into their present hilltop store and slowly, as demand increased, added more exotic selections into their prepared foods. They won some customers over to yellow pear cherry tomatoes through their roasted vegetables; they offered sunflower sprouts next to croutons in the salad bar, and tossed bright orange nasturtiums into the baby lettuce.</p>
        <p>Their business grew into a market that specializes in fruits and vegetables ranging from corn picked each morning to daikon, lemon grass, white cherries and edible flowers. Their store is the first shop in the area to carry mesclun mix.</p>
        <p>What also pleases their customers is the personal touch -- and the basil. The owners give away fresh basil with every tomato purchase. And if patrons are not sure how to prepare an item, the owners offer their own recipes or lend a well-thumbed cookbook from their library.</p>
        <p>The store is also a local affair, serving chanterelle mushrooms from the nearby woods; oatmeal, wheat and garlic-knot loaves baked by Eric Mach, a Manchester stone mason, and horseradish relish, the store's most popular preserve, canned by Jack Stannard, ''who just happens to be the best plumber in town,'' Ms. Whitacre said.</p>
        <p>But not every introduction of a new food is a success. ''We tried it this way, we tried it that way, but no one would buy the jicama root,'' Ms. Whitacre said sadly.</p>
        <p>The Village Green Grocer is on Center Hill Lane in Manchester, Vt; (802) 362-3278. Hours: Monday through Friday, 9 A.M. to 7 P.M.; Saturday, to 5 P.M., and Sunday, noon to 5 P.M.</p>
