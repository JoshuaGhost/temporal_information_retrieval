        <p>Bosnia's election, which was intended to foster unity but was stained by accusations of intimidation and fraud, was certified today by the Western officials who ran it.</p>
        <p>The certification, by the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, was viewed by many as a landmark in the country's move toward stability. It allows for the installation of a new national government and legislature as well as legislatures in the country's two political entities. The results confirm that the three-member presidency will be led by a Muslim and that most legislative seats went to members of the three dominant nationalist parties.</p>
        <p>After validating the results, Robert H. Frowick, the retired American diplomat who leads the European group's mission in Bosnia, conceded that the elections were neither free nor democratic in the tradition of Western democracies, but he said they were acceptable considering that the country was emerging from a war.</p>
        <p>''The elections provided the mechanism to help overcome the centrifugal forces unleashed by the war,'' he said.</p>
        <p>European nations and the United States, which control the European group, are putting to the test their theory that it is better to have a government begin operating, even if it comes to power through flawed elections, than to wait until fairer elections can be held.</p>
        <p>After today's certification, the first step toward creating a functioning Government will be a meeting, expected as early as Monday, of the three-member national executive body called the presidency. The presidency is to consist of one representative of Bosnian Croats, one Serb and one Muslim, each of whom won office in the election on Sept. 14.</p>
        <p>With the election results now official, economic sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia and on the Bosnian Serbs, suspended earlier, can be lifted by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Diplomats and others who opposed going forward with the election say it has only legitimized rule by the three nationalist forces that brought the country to war in the first place.</p>
        <p>Those who opposed holding the elections in September fear that the new government will be deadlocked by conflict among the three dominant nationalist parties. Opposition parties won very few seats in the legislatures, where moderate voices could have an influence.</p>
        <p>Some Bosnian Serb leaders have contended that the victory, by about 40,000 votes, of Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, over Momcilo Krajisnik, a Serb, for chairmanship of the presidency, resulted from election fraud.</p>
        <p>Some Western officials and opposition politicians had been critical of the election preparations almost from the time the first international supervisors arrived in January.</p>
        <p>They complained about confusion and ineptness and about the failure to protect opposition members from intimidation and attacks by thugs supporting the nationalist parties in Muslim, Serb and Croat-controlled areas. But these complaints paled when compared with criticisms of how the voting and ballot counting were handled.</p>
        <p>A private monitoring group, the International Crisis Group, charged that the number of ballots counted was several hundred thousand higher than the number of possible voters. It contended that the only logical explanation was that ballot boxes had been stuffed by election officials, almost all of whom had been named by the governing parties.</p>
        <p>A judicial panel of the Organization for Security and Cooperation agreed that the number of ballots was suspicious, and on Friday it recommended that ballots be recounted.</p>
        <p>But a recount was rejected by the  commission of the European group that has overall responsibility for the election. The commission is dominated by senior members of the organization and representatives of the three Bosnian governing parties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frowick said that it was not known with certainty how many people were eligible to vote or how many had decided not to vote and that therefore there was no reason to suspect the number of ballots cast.</p>
        <p>He also said his view that the election was acceptable, even if flawed, was based in part on the reports of international monitors who observed the voting for the European group.</p>
        <p>The reports are favorable. But monitors visited polling places only periodically, going from one to another, leaving local election officials unsupervised most of the time.</p>
        <p>''These local officials were sitting there with blank ballots and the ballot boxes,'' said an official with the monitoring group, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''That's a big temptation.''</p>
        <p>Some leaders of opposition parties insist there was fraud, but while they predict it will lead to cynicism about the new Government, they take it as something they must accept.</p>
        <p>Zivko Radisic, the leader of a moderate Bosnian Serb coalition, said: ''We know the amount of manipulation was large, but we accept the results because we have no choice. There is no appeal if the West tells us to agree.''</p>
        <p>Haris Silajdzic, who had resigned as Prime Minister of the former Bosnian Government and who lost his bid for the Muslim seat in the presidency, said: ''The power is with the ruling parties and the international community. We can say nothing.''</p>
