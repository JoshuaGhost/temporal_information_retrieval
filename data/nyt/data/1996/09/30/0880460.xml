        <p>OF this column really does find its way into the paper this morning and these words are being read, consider it a triumph of will over destiny.</p>
        <p>It is being worked on during the waning days of Mercury's retrograde motion, and since Mercury is the planetary representative of the Greek god of communications, and computers now fall under his sway, not even the world of high technology is free from his influence, at least according to generally accepted astrological principles.</p>
        <p>Technology buffs who do subscribe to these principles are legion, and World Wide Web sites, Usenet groups and on-line astrology services have been offering warnings for weeks about the period of Mercury's strange motion in the heavens in which it seems to change direction and back up. Even the summertime crash of America Online was attributed to such planetary whimsy (though the accuser had his dates wrong).</p>
        <p>Mercury, to his credit, at least allowed the computer-borne warnings to filter through the chaos. These have been unrelenting. ''Telephone, transportation and mail strikes are common'' during the period just ended, according to one Web site, as are ''mix-ups, delays, misunderstandings and schedule changes.''</p>
        <p>Another site carried the scars of an earlier period of Mercuric poisoning: ''This article got up a bit late. Why? Because of a bad video card that was supposed to flawlessly power our new 20-inch monitor,'' because, well, ''because of Mercury Retrograde. That's why.''</p>
        <p>My editor probably would not have accepted such an excuse, but there were lots of dogs eating homework in cyberspace this month. One confessor on a Compuserve astrology forum realized Mercury was retrograde because ''suddenly all my friends were calling on me to fix their computers.''</p>
        <p>''Is it just me,'' asked a plaintive voice on the Forum last Tuesday, ''or is this Mercury retrograde a really serious one?''</p>
        <p>''The strongest advice I can give you,'' offered one correspondent, as if responding to a query asking for tech support, ''is BACK UP YOUR HARD DRIVE.''</p>
        <p>The Cosmic Muffin on America Online -- who is known in nonastrological circles as Darrell Martinie -- has posted almost daily warnings since Sept. 4 when the retrograde began. Phones, he said, will dial wrong; fax machines will fail; computers will crash. I'm sure he turned out to be right. And though the retrograde ended on the 26th, the Muffin avers that nothing is really safe until today.</p>
        <p>I may sound complacent, having made it through the retrograde unscathed. Some may even say I have been one of the rare beneficiaries of Mercury retrograde. After all, according to ''The Astrology Zone,'' on http://www.pathfinder.com, the period of Mercury retrograde can even lead to good things like parents finding lost children, prosecutors uncovering new clues or columnists happening on ideas.</p>
        <p>There are also some in the industry who may be skeptical about the issue. Scott Winkler, the vice president of the Gartner Group, the consulting firm, confessed, ''Those of us in the boring side of information technology have yet to see any effect of Mercury in retrograde, but I'll keep my eyes open.'' Nathan Myhrvold, a Microsoft group vice president who oversees the company's research efforts, thumbed his nose at potential trouble. ''I don't believe there's any problem,'' he said. ''I rejoice that Mercury is in retrograde motion.''</p>
        <p>It may be that the astrologers had it all wrong. The retrograde motion of Mercury may bear a peculiar relationship to scientific progress and technology: a positive one.</p>
        <p>The retrograde motion is actually an illusion of the heavens. Mercury (along with other planets) makes its way across Earth's sky and then seems to stop and turn backward, before heading forward again on its journey. The problem, in every cosmological theory before Copernicus, was to explain that peculiar motion which takes place three times a year.</p>
        <p>How could such motion be accounted for if all the planets were thought to move in a regular, circular fashion around the fixed Earth? The Roman architect Visuvius suggested that the planets were like ants crawling about a potter's wheel, moving against its motion and seeming at times, to be swept backward. A Greek philosopher suggested that the planetary orbits were on concentric spheres but in different planes, so the motion of one planet was tilted in reference to the other. And the most influential premodern cosmology, codified by Ptolemy, posited circular orbits mounted within other circular orbits, the planets whirling on tops within tops in the heavens.</p>
        <p>These explanations though, never fully accounted for the planetary retrogrades. Who knows? It may even be that, if it weren't for these strange reversals, there would have been almost no impetus to develop an alternate view of the universe. At the risk of overstatement, the retrograde motion of the planets may have been the single greatest inspiration for the development of modern consciousness. Copernicus's explanation of retrogression depended on a new kind of perception: The Earth was turned into another moving body, whose very motion could be sensed in the other planets' retrograde movements.</p>
        <p>That theory, of course, also helped undermine the authority of astrology, as Thomas S. Kuhn, the renowned historian of science, argued. Astrology developed under the premise that the particular movements of the heavenly bodies were causes and Reflections of the human condition. The sky was a metaphor whose every movement corresponded, magically, to the course of human lives. What priority could such a metaphor have once it became just a matter of perspective, one image among many other possible ones?</p>
        <p>Can't we, with a bit of license, imagine a Renaissance of scientific and technological inquiry beginning with that shift in perspective? And can't we imagine that even the invention of the computer and the evolution of cyberspace owe a distant debt in some fashion to the influence of Mercury in retrograde? This is a sort of inverse astrology: the stars helped humanity free itself from their sway. Mercury may be the guiding spirit over technology in more ways than the astrologers will admit. Its stumbling movement is the sign of autonomy, a harbinger of intellectual good fortune.</p>
        <p>And here's more evidence. Its retrograde motion even helped me write this column.</p>

        <p>Correction:  October 18, 1996, Friday</p>
        <p>The technology column in Business Day on Sept. 30 about astrology enthusiasts who attribute technological mishaps to the motions of the planet Mercury misspelled the name of an ancient Roman architect who described planetary orbits by comparing them to ants crawling on a potter's wheel. He was Vitruvius, not Visuvius.</p>
