        <p>The smile smacks of the Cheshire cat, a storybook character Martina Hingis has been far too busy to encounter in this lifetime; she does her prowling in tennis stadiums, not libraries.</p>
        <p>And although her cold-blooded backhand smacks of Chris Evert, an icon Hingis admires, she has confessed to having no interest in emulating Evert. What with her equally cold-blooded forehands, volleys and aces like the one that took her to match point in her first United States Open quarterfinal, Hingis is already far too evolved to look to the past for her role models.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the 15-year-old Swiss sensation is far more interested in becoming her own legend in her own time, and yesterday at the Open she took an already precocious story line one step further by upsetting seventh-seeded Jana Novotna, 7-6 (7-1), 6-4, to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal.</p>
        <p>In the day's other marquee match, Andre Agassi defeated Thomas Muster, 6-2, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2, to set up a semifinal showdown with Michael Chang. But Agassi could not overshadow the performance of the 16th-seeded Hingis.</p>
        <p>With a poise and prescience that enabled her to use the stadium court like a chessboard, she shocked the 27-year-old Novotna to advance against Steffi Graf, the Open's four-time and defending champion.</p>
        <p>Already a collector of top-10 scalps, Hingis, now the youngest Open semifinalist since Jennifer Capriati blasted into the semis in 1991, defeated Graf on clay in the quarterfinals of the Italian Open this spring a week after downing Novotna in Hamburg, Germany.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's occasion was far more important, but if anything, Hingis was far more composed than she had been in their first meeting, the one that showed her she had nothing to fear from the doyennes of the top 10.</p>
        <p>She gave Novotna fits right from the opening game, in which she stepped to the service line, got off to an amateurish 0-40 start and boldly captured the next five points with a mixed bag of restorative playmaking that included an ace, a volley winner and a blithe crosscourt forehand. Novotna was so distracted by the teen-ager's clever recovery that she promptly lost her own service game and fell behind by 2-0.</p>
        <p>''Today against me I felt she was good in all aspects, good at the net, good from the back; she basically knew what she was doing,'' said Novotna, who was most impressed -- and punished -- by the teen-agers's sophisticated court sense. ''She plays very effortless tennis, very light tennis, and she's guessing right for so many balls, so she's there always on time and that makes her good.''</p>
        <p>Even after Novotna calmed down and broke Hingis in the fifth and seventh games, Hingis calmly broke back for 4-4 by standing up to a first serve and rifling her forehand return down the line. In the tie breaker, Novotna served a double fault on the second point, a harbinger of breakdowns to come, and pumped out consecutive errors that put her into a 6-1 hole.</p>
        <p>Hingis converted her first set point with insouciance. She served and volleyed like her namesake, Martina Navratilova, and Novotna tightened up and sent her backhand passing attempt wide of its target.</p>
        <p>''She helped me a lot in the tie breaker, and that was very good for me,'' said Hingis, who then solved a 3-1 deficit in the second set.</p>
        <p>After holding at love for 4-4, Hingis broke Novotna at love, gained triple set point with a 97-mile-an-hour ace, her third of the match, and sealed the upset with a forehand pass on the third match point.</p>
        <p>''At my age you have nothing to lose,'' said Hingis, who won't be able to use that cliche much longer. She turns 16 at the end of the month, and her elders have already stopped thinking of her as anything but a serious threat.</p>
        <p>''She likes to have a target,'' said Novotna, who provided one.</p>
        <p>Novotna wasn't the only flustered player on the premises yesterday, but the other one went on to a better fate.</p>
        <p>Though the second-seeded Chang managed to advance, 7-5, 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 6-3, to his first Open semifinal since 1992, he seemed unusually rushed and rattled getting there. Not only did Chang seem unable to remember which Sanchez -- Javier, Emilio or Arantxa -- he had played, he couldn't recall if he had sneaked out a victory in the fourth set or in the nonexistent fifth.</p>
        <p>''I never have easy matches against the Sanchez brothers,'' Chang said. ''I mean, they're all great fighters, and I'm not just referring to Emilio and Javier; Arantxa is in the same category. They're just not easy players to play. I was fortunate to get a break in the fifth set -- or the fourth set, and hold things off.''</p>
        <p>Chang has never put his trust in tricky shots. He would rather win the hard way, settle into a five-set epic the way most people settle into a hammock, outwait his opponent over the long haul, put in overtime without a complaint.</p>
        <p>So it was surprising yesterday when he resorted to trickery against 67th-ranked Sanchez, a player who had stumbled in the first round of all three other Grand Slams this year and was burdened by an 0-3 record against Chang.</p>
        <p>Eager to take a two-sets-to-none lead after scrambling out of a 4-5 deficit in the first, Chang converted the set with a madcap flourish. He sent Sanchez a backhand drop shot that took a short standard hop on the Spaniard's side of the net and then, propelled by its underspin, hopped back over the net, with Sanchez leaping in pursuit, and bounced again on Chang's side. Chang, who pretended to be oblivious to the whole spectacle, had his lead.</p>
        <p>But Sanchez refused to be stumped in straight sets. Down two breaks in the third, he fought back and broke Chang in the fourth and eighth games, and suddenly what had seemed a sure thing for Chang grew as murky as the haze over the stadium.</p>
        <p>When the third set went to a tie breaker, Chang didn't go with it. Instead it was Sanchez, fueled by his 15-7 record in that specialty this year, who sprang out to a 5-0 lead.</p>
        <p>A wild backhand from Chang gave the Spaniard a set point at 6-2, and he put it to good use by belting a pair of forehands that caught Chang off balance and provoked a forehand reply into the net.</p>
        <p>Losing that set sobered Chang, and he closed out the match in the fourth set with a careful application on controlled aggression, much of it delivered in the form of court-opening forehands struck deep to Sanchez's backhand corner.</p>
        <p>This spotty quarterfinal wasn't the only blip on Chang's Open resume: though his 21-2 record on hardcourts leads the circuit this year, Chang, who reached the 1996 Australian Open final on similar hardcourts without dropping a set, has struggled to live up to his No. 2 seeding upgrade here.</p>
        <p>In his 3-hour-50-minute third-round encounter with Vince Spadea, the longest match of the event this year, Chang, who can become No. 1 in the world if he wins the Open, had to ambush Spadea as he served for the match. Yesterday's glitches left him thankful to get through.</p>
        <p>''Here I am up, 5-2, I have two match points, and he fights those off,'' Chang said, ''and I'm thinking to myself, 'When is this going to end?' ''</p>
