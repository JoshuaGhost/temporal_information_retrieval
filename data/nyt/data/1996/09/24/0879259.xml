        <p>Police officials said yesterday that they were investigating accusations that some male officers secretly watched their female counterparts through a two-inch hole at a women's locker room in a Manhattan police station.</p>
        <p>Investigators from the Internal Affairs Bureau began an inquiry into the allegations last week, interviewing scores of officers from the Traffic Control Division on West 30th Street to determine how many officers may have been involved.</p>
        <p>The case comes as the department has had to contend with other allegations of sexual misconduct. Six instructors from the Police Academy were dismissed last month for dating recruits in violation of the department's policy.</p>
        <p>In addition, the 38,000-member force faces a Federal sexual harassment lawsuit seeking changes in the department's treatment of women.</p>
        <p>And a female officer at a Bronx precinct has filed suit accusing her fellow male officers of sexually harassing her.</p>
        <p>While women hold high-ranking positions in the department, some female officers said that top-level police officials were slow to treat women as equals.</p>
        <p>''The department has been and will always be an all-male bastion,'' said a high-level female officer, who insisted on anonymity, ''and many of them don't see these things as what they are, degrading acts against women. The department has gotten better for women, but it's still not where it should be.''</p>
        <p>Investigators said they believed that perhaps only one female officer, a sergeant, was watched, because she is the only one who uses that locker room to put on her uniform. About 40 female officers share another locker room.</p>
        <p>Officials became aware of the situation after receiving an anonymous tip at the Internal Affairs Bureau, they said.</p>
        <p>When officials went to investigate, they found the tiny gap in the molding of a doorway in the wall separating the locker rooms for male and female supervisors, according to The Daily News, which first reported the story yesterday. Investigators said the hole resulted from faulty construction of the locker rooms about three months ago. Maintenance workers sealed the gap last week, officials said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, police officials said that if the accusations were true, the conduct was reprehensible.</p>
        <p>''It's the ultimate in boorish and sophomoric behavior,'' said Leonardo Alcivar, a police spokesman, ''and the department won't tolerate it.''</p>
        <p>George Cerrone, a lawyer who represents the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said that he could not comment on the allegations because the investigation was not finished. But Mr. Cerrone said that the association would give the sergeant legal help if she asked for it.</p>
        <p>''She's the victim, and whatever the union can do to help her, we will,'' Mr. Cerrone said. ''We support her 100 percent.''</p>
