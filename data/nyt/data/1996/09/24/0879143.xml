        <p>If you're lucky enough to have Della Reese as a guardian angel, it is a good idea to keep her around. ''Promised Land,'' a series spun off ''Touched by an Angel,'' leaves behind the very elements that make that show work: the gimmick of angels who prod people into reforming their lives, and Ms. Reese herself, whose tart delivery makes the otherwise sticky-sweet show palatable.</p>
        <p>In ''Promised Land,'' Gerald McRaney plays Russell Greene, the father of a family traveling across the United States in a camper. When the Greenes were introduced in ''Touched by an Angel'' last week, Russell was out of a job and out of ideas about how to support his family. By the end of the episode, Ms. Reese's angel convinced him to reclaim his 60's idealism and set out on the road and help others.</p>

        <p>If you're lucky enough to have Della Reese as a guardian angel, it is a good idea to keep her around. ''Promised Land,'' a series spun off ''Touched by an Angel,'' leaves behind the very elements that make that show work: the gimmick of angels who prod people into reforming their lives, and Ms. Reese herself, whose tart delivery makes the otherwise sticky-sweet show palatable.</p>
        <p>In ''Promised Land,'' Gerald McRaney plays Russell Greene, the father of a family traveling across the United States in a camper. When the Greenes were introduced in ''Touched by an Angel'' last week, Russell was out of a job and out of ideas about how to support his family. By the end of the episode, Ms. Reese's angel convinced him to reclaim his 60's idealism and set out on the road and help others.</p>
        <p>Now in its regular Tuesday night slot, ''Promised Land'' has become the story of a family traveling the country interfering in other people's business. They may not be angels, but the Greenes are so intensely good they make the Joads in ''The Grapes of Wrath'' seem like slackers. Even at his most relaxed, Mr. McRaney has a fierce, fire-and-brimstone delivery. His family, the most clean-cut in America, includes his wife, Claire (Wendy Phillips), an adolescent son and daughter, a newly acquired nephew whose missing father is bound to turn up eventually, and Grandma Hattie (Celeste Holm), who has a large wardrobe of ridiculous flowered hats.</p>
        <p>Tonight the show strains painfully to be contemporary. The family stops at a small-town festival dedicated to a 60's rock star named Graham Riley, who died of a drug overdose. In the public library, the Greenes' daughter, Dinah (Sarah Schaub), finds an old magazine photo of Mom and Riley passing around a joint. She is horrified. Mom gives a lecture on the evils of drugs, and along the way helps Riley's widow understand her musically gifted son.</p>
        <p>The Greenes are less a family than they are a walking, talking version of ''The Book of Virtues.'' But at least the show's scheduling is clever, setting it opposite the much less reverent, more credible families of ''Roseanne'' and ''Mad About You.''</p>
