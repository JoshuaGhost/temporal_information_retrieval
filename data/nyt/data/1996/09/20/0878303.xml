        <p>BEING a performance artist isn't easy and probably no one knows this better than Paul McCarthy, whose exhibition at the Luhring Augustine Gallery in SoHo is among the season's more notable openers.</p>
        <p>Starting in the early 1970's in Los Angeles, Mr. McCarthy gained a reputation for grueling, psychologically charged events in which suggestive foodstuffs -- ketchup, mayonnaise and hot dogs -- and intimations of bodily functions played big roles. Confrontational and disturbing, but also infused with the artist's own vulnerability, these works offended some and moved others. Largely improvised, they spared neither taboo nor sacred cow, desecrating the family, colonialism and painting while conjuring up masturbation, incest and the scatological, all with the goal, it seemed, of giving the collective unconscious a new and radical immediacy.</p>

        <p>BEING a performance artist isn't easy and probably no one knows this better than Paul McCarthy, whose exhibition at the Luhring Augustine Gallery in SoHo is among the season's more notable openers.</p>
        <p>Starting in the early 1970's in Los Angeles, Mr. McCarthy gained a reputation for grueling, psychologically charged events in which suggestive foodstuffs -- ketchup, mayonnaise and hot dogs -- and intimations of bodily functions played big roles. Confrontational and disturbing, but also infused with the artist's own vulnerability, these works offended some and moved others. Largely improvised, they spared neither taboo nor sacred cow, desecrating the family, colonialism and painting while conjuring up masturbation, incest and the scatological, all with the goal, it seemed, of giving the collective unconscious a new and radical immediacy.</p>
        <p>As with other performance artists of his generation -- Chris Burden and Vito Acconci come to mind -- Mr. McCarthy tested limits that often seemed as much physical and social as esthetic, and he tested them longer than most. But nearly every performance artist reaches a point of exhaustion where object-making becomes a very attractive option. Mr. McCarthy reached this point in 1985 and has since conducted his shock therapy mostly with sexually explicit mechanized sculptures and installation works that feature the artist performing at a remove, on video screen, if at all.</p>
        <p>For his third solo show in New York, which has been a little slow to attend to his bizarre achievement, Mr. McCarthy has created ''Yaa-Hoo Town,'' an antiheroic mechanized environment that depicts the Old West as a place of rampaging violence. In the process, it also lampoons the back lots of Hollywood, where western myth was forged in gold. One of the most elaborate installation pieces of his career, ''Yaa-Hoo Town'' is only his second large-scale work from which his presence is entirely absent. (The first, ''The Garden,'' was shown at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art's ''Helter Skelter'' exhibition in 1992, in Europe, and may be seen in New York sometime this season.)</p>
        <p>A Disneyesque walk on the wild side, ''Yaa-Hoo Town'' works better formally, in terms of scale and color, than narratively, usually Mr. McCarthy's strength. It is dominated by gleaming larger-than-life mannequins with enormous doll or animal heads who often commit or threaten unspeakable acts, mostly sodomy. These are cute in a vacant sort of Hollywood way (until you see what they're up to). They inhabit a seductive movie set of watering trough, corral, saloon and bunkhouse whose  cartoonish forms and nearly fluorescent colors underscore Mr. McCarthy's early years as a painter.</p>
        <p>There are some memorable moments and sights: a big blond, blue-eyed female head looming periodically above the swinging doors of the orange saloon, like a weird portent of the Barbies and television hostesses of the future. A dog-headed bartender laconically pours a drink while the blonde offers her bare bottom to a masturbating cowboy and gunshots ring out. Nearby, a two-faced (young and old) Indian maid drums listlessly on a tom-tom; her brown-stockinged legs are footless stumps. Conjuring up the violent progress of Manifest Destiny, Mr. McCarthy's Pocahontas is perhaps the most genuinely disturbing figure here. Also oddly effective are a boy and girl who toss and turn in their sleep in the red-orange bunkhouse while a roommate is sexually abused by a dog-headed cowboy.</p>
        <p>But for the most part, the shocks and innuendos tend to be more numbing and predictable than thought-provoking. (One problem, due in part to Mr. Mc.Carthy's own influence, may be that sex is so overdone in art these days that it is becoming ho-hum.) That the mythic Old West was a violent, racist, misogynist, imperialistic place where life nonetheless went on (people worked and slept) is nothing new, nor is the idea that its hypocrisy and barbarism may still be fundamental to our national character. Mr. McCarthy makes such ideas visually and comically vivid, but otherwise does almost nothing with them. What impresses one most is simply the sense of time, money and demented determination necessary to convert Mr. McCarthy's private compulsions, previously improvised in performance, into raucous sculptural tableaux that offer the grim prospect of going on forever. And while ''Yaa-Hoo Town'' may demonstrate Mr. McCarthy's considerable skills as a colorist, sculptor and mechanical engineer, it never compensates for the loss of the artist's own maniacal, improvising presence and the special sense of havoc that even on video it brings to the chain of events.</p>
        <p>Paul McCarthy's ''Yaa-Hoo Town'' remains at the Luhring Augustine Gallery, 130 Prince Street, SoHo, through Oct. 12.</p>
