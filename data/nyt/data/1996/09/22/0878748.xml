        <p>WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE: Original Stories About Growing Up. Edited by Amy Ehrlich. Candlewick. $15.99. (Ages 9 to 14) In answer to the plea ''Tell me about when you were young,'' 10 distinguished writers -- including Katherine Paterson, Walter Dean Myers and Francesca Lia Block -- contributed tales true to the time and place of their own childhoods, if not necessarily absolutely factual. Rich and rewarding.</p>
        <p>THE TRUTH ABOUT CATS. Written and illustrated by Alan Snow. Little, Brown. $14.95. (Ages 4 to 8) The manic companion volume to ''How Dogs Really Work'' is filled with loony diagrams and silly theories.</p>
        <p>COME SUNDAY. By Nikki Grimes. Illustrated by Michael Bryant. Eerdmans. Cloth, $15; paper, $7.50. (Ages 4 to 8) LaTasha spends Sunday at her neighborhood church, and the short verses and exuberant illustrations convey the joy and satisfaction she finds.</p>
        <p>WHEN BIRDS COULD TALK &amp; BATS COULD SING: The Adventures of Bruh Sparrow, Sis Wren, and Their Friends. By Virginia Hamilton. Illustrated by Barry Moser. Blue Sky/ Scholastic. $17.95. (All ages) These bird and bat stories, each with a moral, were first collected by Martha Young (1862-1941) and told in heavy Southern black dialect. They have been charmingly retold and illustrated.</p>
        <p>TREASURE ISLAND. By Robert Louis Stevenson. Illustrated by Francois Place. Viking. $23.99. (Ages 12 and up) In this edition from the ''Whole Story'' series of classic titles, the text is surrounded by marginal annotations, elaborate illustrations and supporting historical material (not unlike the text supports in some CD-ROM's).</p>
        <p>MELANIE JANE. By Susan Arkin Couture. Illustrated by Isabelle Dervaux. Laura Geringer/ HarperCollins. $14.95. (Ages 3 to 6) Everyone knows a Melanie Jane -- she's so spoiled that in a tantrum about the color of the sky she flies onto a cloud to sulk. She is finally ignored and at last comes down a sweeter girl.</p>
