        <p>Probably no European capital is as compact and intimate, as friendly to pedestrians and hostile to cars as Amsterdam. So our day will be entirely on foot. Never mind the marijuana culture and the beckoning of the city's lazy cannabis cafes. This itinerary will begin at the medieval core, the place where Amsterdam was born.</p>
        <p>The Dam Square is exactly that: the site where the River Amstel was dammed in the 13th century, giving the city its name and its permanently unruly heart. Here is the great Renaissance town hall, proof of the wealth of the 17th-century merchants (it later became a royal palace), and next door are the Gothic arches of the 15th-century New Church. It is remarkable that all this stony weight rests on thousands of wooden piles pegged into the unsteady sandy soil.</p>

        <p>Probably no European capital is as compact and intimate, as friendly to pedestrians and hostile to cars as Amsterdam. So our day will be entirely on foot.

        <p>The Dam Square is exactly that: the site where the River Amstel was dammed in the 13th century, giving the city its name and its permanently unruly heart. Here is the great Renaissance town hall, proof of the wealth of the 17th-century merchants (it later became a royal palace), and next door are the Gothic arches of the 15th-century New Church. It is remarkable that all this stony weight rests on thousands of wooden piles pegged into the unsteady sandy soil.</p>
        <p>We must see Our Lord in the Attic, an intriguing clandestine church from the 17th century, when the ruling Protestants would not let Catholics worship publicly. It is the only secret church left, occupying the upper floors of one large and two smaller homes. Visiting this house, beautifully preserved and furnished with original pieces, is like walking through a Vermeer painting.</p>
        <p>Another enticing, half-hidden place is the Amsterdam Historical Museum. A small, lopsided gateway on the Kalverstreet leads into the cluster of 17th-century buildings, once the city orphanage. It has an impressive display of documents and objects covering seven centuries, but I'm rather partial to its play-it-yourself carillon and the surprising outdoor (though glassed-in) art gallery with its images from the prosperous, bourgeois past: aligned here are large group portraits of the Civic Guards and the guilds, part of that popular painting tradition from which Rembrandt's ''Night Watch'' also sprang.</p>
        <p>A few minutes away is Spui, an enticing, leafy square and very much a local reference point. Here is the University Library, as well as many people's favorite pub, Hoppe, and next door, Atheneum, one of the country's finest book and magazine stores. In front of Atheneum is the statue of a boy, Lieverdje (Little Sweetheart), easy to overlook but a great Amsterdam icon. It was the rallying point for the student and anarchist movements of the 1960's and since then a symbol of rebellion.</p>
        <p>On Spui, hidden behind a low archway, is the Begijnhof, an enchanting courtyard lined with small 15th-  to 18th-century homes that were built for women who had taken religious vows. No. 34, dating from 1475, is said to be the city's oldest wooden house.</p>
        <p>Time to stop for lunch, in the Cafe Luxembourg, next to Hoppe. A sprawling, informal place, it is good for light snacks, browsing in the periodicals stacked on the reading tables and taking in the media crowd. My favorite snack: an order of ''croquettes,'' little hot meat rolls, crisp on the outside, perfumed with nutmeg and served with fried parsley and mustard.</p>
        <p>Our route now winds along the grand Herengracht to the Nieuwe Spiegelstraat, popular because of its art galleries and informal antique shops. Nearby is Amsterdam at its intimate best, a neigborhood of narrow canals with little arched bridges, house boats, cyclists, and charming gables. We stop at the small Museum van Loon, less for examining its family portraits than for but to exploreing the inside of one of the finest accessible canal mansions.</p>
        <p>At night, we will go to Ijsbreker, the center for contemporary and experimental music, which in mid-October offers a series of ''Concerts for the Future.'' And dinner will be devoted to rijsttafel, an Indonesian feast. Restaurant Bojo Speciaal is one of the finest of its kind. At least a dozen small dishes will appear, dressed in peanut or coconut or sweet vinegary sauces. We order lots of dark, bittersweet beer. Before leaving town, we will buy two delicious souvenirs: a ball of  ''old'' Gouda cheese, as tasty as Parmesan, and a pack of speculaas, superb Dutch biscuits, laced with ginger and cinnamon.</p>
