        <p>IN a small auditorium in lower Manhattan last week, the New York State Insurance Department held its final hearing on a new regulation intended to combat deceptive practices in the selling of life insurance policies, a longstanding problem that has cost consumers millions of dollars.</p>
        <p>At the same time, insurance regulators from a dozen other states have been drafting similar standards, which are expected to be endorsed later this month by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. They would become a model for regulation throughout the country.</p>
        <p>''Initially, everyone thought there were isolated cases of this just in their backyards,'' said Brian Atchinson, the president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the superintendent of insurance in Maine. ''Then we realized all of our backyards looked a lot alike. This was a problem clearly of national scope.''</p>
        <p>The practice, referred to as ''twisting'' or ''churning'' by unhappy customers, and by the less colorful term of ''replacement'' by the industry, has been a problem in New York, one of the biggest insurance markets in the country and the home of scores of insurance companies.</p>
        <p>Churning became widespread in the 1980's when interest rates were climbing. Some insurance agents persuaded customers to trade in their old policies for new ones at higher prices with no advantage to anyone but the agent, who received a commission, and his company, which increased its sales. The lure to the customer was higher returns on the new policies.</p>
        <p>Customers were often offered whole-life and universal life policies -- which pay a death benefit and offer an investment feature -- that could match the yields of 12 percent and higher that investors were getting from mutual funds and virtually risk-free money markets. For the many people who were holding old policies paying interest of, say, 6 percent, the new policies sounded attractive.</p>
        <p>But in many cases, zealous agents showed projections of the phenomenally high interest rates continuing for 20 or 30 years. They did not explain that what goes up most often comes down. Customers also say they did not realize they would lose some critical benefits provided in their original policies. When interest rates eventually fell, many policyholders were left worse off than when they started.</p>
        <p>''In fairness,'' Mr. Atchinson said, ''during the booming 80's a lot of very intelligent people lost sight of cyclical turns and didn't seem to realize that interest rates weren't going to stay high forever.''</p>
        <p>Some of the largest insurance companies in the country have settled disputes over churning. The Prudential Insurance Company of America agreed in July to pay a $35 million fine and to query 10.7 million policyholders for possible claims of improper sales practices that investigators say could cost the company up to $1 billion in compensation. (If all the policyholders file valid claims -- which is considered unlikely -- the average payout would be about $90.) The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company of Boston, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and New York Life have agreed to compensate some policyholders.</p>
        <p>Churning has been an embarrassment to an industry that sells itself on trust, and many insurance executives say they believe it has also hurt sales. In Washington last week, the American Council of Life Insurance, a group of 580 life and health insurance companies, announced the creation of the Insurance Marketplace Standards Association to write a code of conduct for the companies.</p>
        <p>In New York, hearings on regulations to aid consumers began last fall, and with the final hearing on Tuesday, Edward J. Muhl, the state Insurance Superintendent, said the new rules should be in place by the end of the year. They still must be reviewed by the office of Gov. George E. Pataki and posted publicly before taking effect.</p>
        <p>''The root of the churning and twisting problem is that policyholders often lack crucial information,'' Mr. Muhl said.</p>
        <p>One of the most significant of Mr. Muhl's proposals would require an agent who is selling a replacement policy to notify the company that issued the original policy so it can make a counter sales pitch, arguing why the original policy is better than the replacement. Agents would also be required to explain in writing why a replacement would be an improvement for the customer.</p>
        <p>In addition, the new regulation would give customers up to 60 days to change their minds after agreeing to a replacement. It would also require companies to appoint a senior executive to monitor the compliance of the company and its agents, although some companies are doing that voluntarily. New York Life, for example, has created a compliance group of 110 employees to guard against improper sales. Prudential follows up on new life insurance sales by an employee outside the sales force.</p>
        <p>In the Prudential case, investigators from state insurance departments around the country found that the company had provided agents with misleading sales materials and had failed to monitor sales practices. It not only failed to discipline agents who were reported to have relied on deceptive tactics, but repeatedly promoted many of them, sending a bold wink of the eye to its agents while maintaining a public policy of adherence to the highest standards of integrity.</p>
        <p>Robert DeFillipo, the company's director of public relations, said that while Prudential had accepted the findings of the investigation, it believes ''the vast majority of the 10.7 million policyholders were treated fairly.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''We are absolutely committed to resolving every legitimate customer complaint.''</p>
        <p>NEW YORK State Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, the chairman of the Assembly's committee on insurance, says the commission system gives agents the incentive to churn. At the close of a sale in New York, agents receive up to 55 percent of the first year's premium; in some states the commission is more than the total first-year premium. This keeps agents hungrier to find new business than to preserve old policies, even though the economics of life insurance make long-term arrangements best for most customers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grannis, who will hold a hearing on Oct. 10 in Manhattan on pending legislation concerning agent compensation, says one solution might be to reduce the commission in the first year and extend the payout to agents over a longer period, giving them a greater interest in keeping a policy in force. Another proposal by Mr. Grannis is to require agents to explain their pay system to customers, so they can see the agent's financial interest.</p>
        <p>In the insurance department hearing, Nathan M. Perlmutter, an insurance agent and son of an agent speaking on behalf of the National Association of Life Underwriters, an agents' group, argued that compensation is not a primary motive for churning. Even so, he said, as a gesture of good will, the organization proposed that the new regulation stipulate that no commissions be paid until after the 60-day period in which the customer may reject the replacement policy.</p>
        <p>Speaking in support of the proposed changes, Albert R. Dawson, a senior lawyer for the American Council of Life Insurance, said that ''few subjects arouse as much passion and anxiety in our business as does replacement.''</p>
        <p>In some cases, he said, it makes sense to replace an existing policy. But with churning and twisting, he said, a ''salesperson puts personal gain first and the client interest second.''</p>
        <p>''Invariably,'' he added, ''the client loses.''</p>
