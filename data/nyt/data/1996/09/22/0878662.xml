        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Samuel G. Freedman's article about the Goldwater campaign's documentary ''Choice'' $(''The First Days of the Loaded Political Image,'' Sept. 1$), brought back memories; the more so because, unlike many reporters who have written about ''Choice'' for the last 30 years, Mr. Freedman did his homework and got it right.</p>
        <p>As the producer of the documentary, may I offer one observation. Having a menacing black, luxury car careering down a dusty road with beer cans flying out the window symbolize Lyndon Johnson was not a fictional device. Johnson's high-speed chases around his Texas ranch at the wheel of his Lincoln Continental, accompanied only by a six-pack of Pearl beer and pursued by F.B.I. men, were a fact and widely reported at the time. The 1963 Continental used in the film belonged to me.</p>
        <p>Nancy Reagan did indeed send me Ray Massey, whose narration was just plain superb, as was the closing cameo by John Wayne. Since there were no credits on ''Choice,'' Hollywood was not only infuriated but consumed by an interest in just who had worked on this traitorous, high-octane salvo from the right. Surprisingly, they were among the industry's heaviest creative hitters: the writer Otis Carney, the director Henry Ludwin, the music coordinator Graham Mahan, and the editor Gene Fowler Jr.</p>
        <p>With due respect to the late Cliff White, who was the first to identify and advocate the issue, actually producing a documentary on the country's moral decline to illustrate and define the difference in the character of the two men running for President was the idea of the executive director of the Goldwater Citizen's Committee, Rus Walter.</p>
        <p>I'd like to produce ''Choice II'' today. There is plenty of material.</p>
