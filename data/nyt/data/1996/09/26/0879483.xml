        <p>George Greenberg, the creative director of Fox Sports, jogged across 72d Street yesterday with good news for the waiting film crew. ''Messier's asking what his motivation is,'' he said. ''Gretzky said, 'We're the Odd Couple.' ''</p>
        <p>The former Edmonton teammates, now Rangers, were filming Fox's recasting of ''The Odd Couple's'' opening sequence for a spot promoting its National Hockey League telecasts. Here, Gretzky, assuming the Felix Unger role, has ''left his place of residence'' -- the St. Louis Blues -- ''never to return.''</p>

        <p>George Greenberg, the creative director of Fox Sports, jogged across 72d Street yesterday with good news for the waiting film crew. ''Messier's asking what his motivation is,'' he said. ''Gretzky said, 'We're the Odd Couple.' ''</p>
        <p>The former Edmonton teammates, now Rangers, were filming Fox's recasting of ''The Odd Couple's'' opening sequence for a spot promoting its National Hockey League telecasts. Here, Gretzky, assuming the Felix Unger role, has ''left his place of residence'' -- the St. Louis Blues -- ''never to return.''</p>
        <p>''What I want to know,'' Gretzky said afterward, ''is why I'm Felix and he's Oscar. I'm an Oscar. My wife's always picking up after me.''</p>
        <p>Messier, perhaps contemplating the essence of Madisonian behavior, had nothing to say.</p>
        <p>As the ersatz Unger, Gretzky forlornly exited an apartment marked by the Blues logo and turned back to take a hockey stick from an anonymous hand, much as the actor Tony Randall was handed cookware when he left his place of residence.</p>
        <p>And there were Gretzky, stick in hand, and Messier, Ranger cap turned backward on his shaved dome, as the actor Jack Klugman wore a Mets cap as the slovenly Oscar did, walking east along 72d Street in their Ranger uniforms.</p>
        <p>Their presence attracted onlookers outside 322 West 72d, which had the awning address altered to read ''1049,'' the Park Avenue address where the TV roommates lived. A harried couple carrying luggage botched a take. Cyclists sped by. A police car double-parked in front, but without Murray the Cop.</p>
        <p>''Move those people out quicker,'' an assistant director shouted to the crew.</p>
        <p>Outside the high rise, Messier and Gretzky studied a tape of the sitcom's opening on a monitor to see how the TV characters left the lobby, how they eyed each other, and how Randall used the pointed end of his umbrella to pick up a cigar butt tossed blithely to the sidewalk by Klugman.</p>
        <p>In Fox's version, Messier dropped an apple core instead. Gretzky tried to flip it into a nearby garbage can with his stick but failed.</p>
        <p>Throughout the filming, the players had no lines. ''It's easier that way,'' Gretzky said, adding that his wife, the actress Janet Jones, gave him no acting guidance. ''I wish she had,'' he said with a smile.</p>
