        <p>Not far from the town hall in this farming community is a leafy grove of trees where young boys tend to fat cattle and a steady breeze stirs the fragrant air. Underneath the trees are two mass graves, ringed with flowers, where lie the remains of at least 2,000 people killed with machetes during the mass killing of Tutsi in 1994.</p>
        <p>The survivors in Taba say the man most responsible for horrors that occurred here is the former Mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu. As the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda begins genocide trials in Arusha, Tanzania, Mr. Akayesu is the first man in the dock.</p>
        <p>He has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges, including genocide, murder and crimes against humanity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Akayesu, a 43-year-old Hutu, is not the highest official in the former Rwanda Government to face charges. Nor is he considered to be the main architect of the horror that racked this Central African country from April to June 1994, in which at least 500,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed.</p>
        <p>But to the people who survived Mr. Akayesu's reign of terror, it hardly matters. They say he wielded absolute power in this commune, going to extraordinary lengths to hunt down and kill Tutsi.</p>
        <p>''He was giving the orders and he was writing the names of people who were supposed to be killed,'' said Emmanuel Ndavisaba, a 39-year-old Tutsi farmer who survived. ''Doctors, nurses, teachers, farmers. Many, many, many people died because of Akayesu.''</p>
        <p>Survivors said Mr. Akayesu exhorted Hutu militia members to hack thousands of Tutsi to death with hammers and machetes and to dump their bodies in mass graves just 50 yards from his office. Searching out Tutsi intellectuals, he tortured Hutu men and women who tried to hide people from the killers, they said.</p>
        <p>As the violence got under way in early April 1994, Mr. Akayesu, a former teacher, also rushed from place to place to deliver incendiary speeches to Hutu, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>''Akayesu said go and kill the Tutsi men, because they are the ones who make children, and if you come across a woman who is pregnant, rip the baby from her belly,'' said Bernadette Ntakirutinka, a 60-year-old Hutu who said she was tortured because she hid Tutsi. ''He said they have to go to each and every house, and kill them one by one.''</p>
        <p>$(As the trial opened on Thursday, a defense lawyer said he would ask for a postponement, arguing that he had not had the resources to prepare an adequate defense, The Associated Press reported. The court is to rule on the request on Friday.$)</p>
        <p>What happened in Taba opens a window on the inner workings of the mass killing throughout Rwanda in 1994. The Hutu militias -- known as the interhamwe -- were not the majority here, but they had the full backing of local politicians like Mr. Akayesu, survivors said.</p>
        <p>When the killings started, many of Taba's Tutsi flocked to the town hall to see Mr. Akayesu, believing he would stop the carnage, survivors said. Instead, they added, most of the people who sought refuge at his offices were slain in the parking lot while he watched, the survivors said.</p>
        <p>''When the killings started, the people believed the enemy was the interhamwe, the militia,'' said Ephrem Karangwa, the current Mayor of Taba. ''Mr. Akayesu gathered all the villagers and told them that the common enemy was no longer the interhamwe, but the Tutsi.''</p>
        <p>As a prominent Tutsi and a police investigator, Mr. Karangwa was among the first to be selected as targets by Mr. Akayesu's militia.</p>
        <p>Running from killers who burned his house to the ground, Mr. Karangwa said, he witnessed the deaths of his three brothers at the hands of Mr. Akayesu and the militia. Mr. Karangwa, who was hiding in a banana field nearby, later escaped by bribing a policeman to hide him.</p>
        <p>In addition to being mayor, Mr. Akayesu was the local head of the Democratic Republican Party, a Hutu party that opposed the Government of former President Juvenal Habyarimana, also a Hutu.</p>
        <p>On April 6, 1994, Mr. Habyarimana died in a suspicious plane crash after signing a power-sharing agreement with Tutsi rebels, who had been fighting a civil war with the Hutu-led Government since 1991. Hutu hard-liners seized control of the country that day and gave the militia the go-ahead to begin killing Tutsi civilians.</p>
        <p>Still, the mass killing did not start until 12 days later in Taba, which is in the central prefecture of Gitarama. At first, survivors said, Mr. Akayesu refused to allow the militia to operate in his township and even imprisoned some militia leaders.</p>
        <p>Then on April 18, after a meeting of local mayors in Gitarama, they said Mr. Akayesu abruptly changed his stance and became a vocal supporter of genocide. That night, a group of militiamen in Taba killed a prominent Tutsi teacher, Sylvere Karera. The next morning, Mr. Akayesu held a town meeting that turned out to be a turning point for the community, residents said.</p>
        <p>Instead of calling for peace, as many people had expected, the Mayor condoned the killing of Mr. Karera and called on Hutu to begin killing ''accomplices'' to the Tutsi rebels, residents recalled. He specifically named three prominent Tutsi for death, they said. One of them was Mr. Karangwa.</p>
        <p>For the next two days, survivors said, Mr. Akayesu was a one-man scourge. Dressed in a military uniform and armed with a pistol, they said he led gangs of killers in search of Tutsi families and gave speeches in which he promised land to Hutu who killed Tutsi.</p>
        <p>In the indictment, he is charged with torturing people accused of harboring Tutsi, of ordering the slaying of eight Tutsi men who fled to the town hall, and of overseeing the killings of five schoolteachers in the parking lot. He is also accused of personally shooting to death one of Mr. Karangwa's brothers.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Akayesu's urging, the militia set up roadblocks and killed scores of people every day for weeks, according to survivors. Some people, they said, were reduced to paying the militia for bullets to avoid being killed by machete.</p>
        <p>Mr. Akayesu fled Rwanda at the end of June 1994, just before a Tutsi rebel army rolled into Gitarama. He escaped to Zaire, then went to Zambia, where the authorities arrested him in Lusaka in October 1995. The tribunal indicted him in February, and he was extradited to Tanzania to stand trial.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ntakirutinka, 60, said she was tortured on the evening of April 19. A Hutu who was married to a Tutsi, Mrs. Ntakirutinka had hidden three Tutsi women and some children in her home.</p>
        <p>She said Mr. Akayesu showed up at 9 P.M. that night with several men. They dragged her out to the road, beat her, forced her face down on the ground, stood on her neck and wrenched her arms behind her back.</p>
        <p>Later they threatened to run over her with a car, unless she told where her Tutsi friends were hiding. She refused. Her friends escaped out the back of her house, but were later captured and killed.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ntakirutinka, whose husband and two grandchildren were killed, said she had decided to help the Tutsi women after hearing Mr. Akayesu's speech that morning.</p>
        <p>''I was born among human beings,'' she said. ''I am a human being. I have loved. I was loved. And I lived peacefully with the Tutsi people. I had no problems with them. Akayesu is an evil man.''</p>
        <p>Some survivors in Taba said that no matter what happens to Mr. Akayesu, it cannot undo the damage caused by the mass killings.</p>
        <p>''The pain is still there and it will not just leave like that,'' Mr. Karangwa said. ''There is a Rwandan saying that people who die are not buried in a field, they are buried in the heart.''</p>
