        <p>To The Home Section:</p>
        <p>A recent article (''A Few Curves Give an L Some Flair,'' Aug. 29) on a divorced executive's sleek Battery Park City condominium portrays the owner, David Wine, as a man on the brink of a new life. Not long ago, my 20-year marriage came to an end and, like Mr. Wine, my husband chose to leave most of his possessions behind and start fresh in a new apartment with new furniture.</p>
        <p>Reinventing one's life is great, but the reality is that after a divorce, both former spouses must start over.  People like Mr. Wine and my husband are the lucky ones: ensconced in brand-new surroundings, they can disown their pasts.</p>

        <p>How about an article on the spouses who face the task of fashioning a new life in the midst of child-battered sofas, walls of family photographs and all the other mementos of a marriage?</p>
