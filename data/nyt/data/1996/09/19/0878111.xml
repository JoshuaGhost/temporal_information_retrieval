        <p>The Yankees, who lost a lucrative date at the gate in the wake of Tuesday night's rainout, announced plans yesterday for those ticket-holders who lost out as well.</p>
        <p>Fans with rain checks from the postponed game against the Orioles can exchange them for any available seats to today's twilight-night doubleheader with Baltimore at Yankee Stadium, which begins at 4:05 P.M., or for any of the Yankees' remaining six home games -- four with Boston this weekend and two with Milwaukee next Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>

        <p>In addition, each fan from Tuesday night's rainout will receive for each rain check a complimentary reserved ticket to his choice of the games with the Brewers next week, the final two of the regular season at the Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Yankees cautioned fans seeking to use rain checks tonight that they probably would not get the identical seat they had on Tuesday but could expect a comparable one.</p>
