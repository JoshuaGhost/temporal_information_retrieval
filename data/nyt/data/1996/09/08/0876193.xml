        <p>As a candidate last spring, Benjamin Netanyahu lacerated Israel's Labor-led Government for negotiating with Yasir Arafat, making himself a rallying point for all those Israelis who recoiled at the recognition of Mr. Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization and the subsequent talks that had led to Israel's exchange of land for the hope of peace. It was the issue on which Mr. Netanyahu was elected Prime Minister.</p>
        <p>But for all his disdain of Mr. Arafat and promises of toughness in future talks, Mr. Netanyahu had also said he would respect agreements already reached, and last week he reminded Israelis of that when the inevitable moment came to shake hands with Mr. Arafat and sit down across a table from him, formally reopening negotiations. At a subsequent news conference, both men repeated their commitment to the Israeli-Palestinian peace.</p>

        <p>But for all his disdain of Mr. Arafat and promises of toughness in future talks, Mr. Netanyahu had also said he would respect agreements already reached, and last week he reminded Israelis of that when the inevitable moment came to shake hands with Mr. Arafat and sit down across a table from him, formally reopening negotiations. At a subsequent news conference, both men repeated their commitment to the Israeli-Palestinian peace.</p>
        <p>The next day, Mr. Netanyahu went on national television and faced his own Likud Party's leadership, warning his ministers to accept ''the principle of the continuation of the process according to our understanding, in the way we are directing it'' or leave. Two of the most prominent -- Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Science Minister Benny Begin -- spoke toughly to distance themselves from the new policies. But Mr. Netanyahu stressed that ''in the battle for peace, as in the battle for election or in war, there is only one commander,'' and most Israelis seemed to welcome or accept his dealing with Mr. Arafat.</p>
