        <p>A 13-year-old boy from France has admitted to painting swastikas along a nature trail in Mamaroneck this summer, the police said. But investigators said they do not believe the boy is responsible for several other incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism over the last eight months in the quiet Westchester town.</p>
        <p>The boy, whose name was not released, surrendered at the Mamaroneck police headquarters on Saturday, the police said. He was charged with several misdemeanors, said Officer Thomas Houlahan. The police described the boy as a former Mamaroneck resident who lives with his family in Manhattan and whose father works in the French consulate.</p>
        <p>Correction:  October 5, 1996, Saturday</p>
        <p>A brief article on Sept. 23 about a boy accused of painting swastikas on a nature trail in Mamaroneck, N.Y., referred incorrectly in some editions to his father's employer. The police did not specifically identify the family. According to the French Consulate General in New York, the father is not an employee of the consulate.</p>
