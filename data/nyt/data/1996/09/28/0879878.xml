        <p>When a fight broke out after a church service on Sept. 15 at the Essex County Youth Detention Facility, Joe Clark, the director, ordered 12 of the youths shackled for two and a half days, he acknowledged yesterday. ''It's time for us to step up and hold juveniles who are 16, 17 and 18 accountable for their actions,'' Mr. Clark, the former high school principal who inspired the film ''Lean on Me,'' said yesterday. But Mr. Clark's tough brand of discipline, which he said followed a series of violent episodes, has prompted an investigation by the state's Division of Youth and Family Services. Wendi Patella, an agency spokeswoman, said the shackling of minors for extended periods is prohibited.</p>
