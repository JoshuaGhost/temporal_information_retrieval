        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I believe the offer by John Cardinal O'Connor to take 1,000 poorly performing New York City schoolchildren into the Catholic Archdiocese's school system (news articles, Sept. 9-12) is well intentioned and of good will, but it bears not a small amount of competition -- pitting the public  against the parochial system.</p>
        <p>I am opposed to any such competition because I believe it would be a prelude to a strong move for a voucher system. Such a system would be the end of our public school system as we have known it.</p>

        <p>I believe the offer by John Cardinal O'Connor to take 1,000 poorly performing New York City schoolchildren into the Catholic Archdiocese's school system (news articles, Sept. 9-12) is well intentioned and of good will, but it bears not a small amount of competition -- pitting the public  against the parochial system.</p>
        <p>I am opposed to any such competition because I believe it would be a prelude to a strong move for a voucher system. Such a system would be the end of our public school system as we have known it.</p>
        <p>Fifty years ago, many Roman Catholic schools, if not most, were found wanting when compared with public schools. Now that situation is reversed, largely because the public schools have deteriorated. Under a voucher system, public schools will only deteroriate further. We all  know a good public school system is essential to this city and to this country.</p>
