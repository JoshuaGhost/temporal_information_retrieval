        <p>In a deal that joins two household names, Gillette agreed to acquire Duracell, the world's leading producer of alkaline batteries, for about $7 billion in stock. The agreement, which the companies announced jointly, ends a five-year search by Gillette for what Alfred M. Zeien, its chairman and chief executive, has called a ''new leg'' acquisition, one that would take the company that makes everything from razors to toothbrushes to pens into a new product category.</p>

        <p>In a deal that joins two household names, Gillette agreed to acquire Duracell, the world's leading producer of alkaline batteries, for about $7 billion in stock. The agreement, which the companies announced jointly, ends a five-year search by Gillette for what Alfred M. Zeien, its chairman and chief executive, has called a ''new leg'' acquisition, one that would take the company that makes everything from razors to toothbrushes to pens into a new product category.</p>
        <p>Analysts and investors were enthusiastic. ''There are not too many acquisitions that could be better for Gillette,'' said Andrew Shore, an analyst at Paine Webber. Probably the biggest winner in the deal is Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Company, the leveraged buyout firm that now owns 34 percent of Duracell but paid $1.8 billion when it bought the company from Kraft in 1988.</p>
