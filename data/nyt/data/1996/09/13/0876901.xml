        <p>LITTLE-KNOWN fact of the week: the Brooklyn Museum established the first photographic department in an American museum in 1889, some 51 years before the Museum of Modern Art (which ordinarily gets the credit) had a department of its own. Brooklyn, however, was primarily a museum of natural history and anthropology, where you were as likely to see butterflies and bones as paintings of the American West. The Department of Photography, rich in ethnographic material, was blissfully unaware of art. In 1974, Barbara Head Millstein, the present curator, discovered a closet that had been locked since 1957; inside was the photographic collection, a good deal of which had been magically transformed into art in the interval by changing tastes and markets.</p>
        <p>Since anthropologists and ethnologists, inveterate collectors by profession, had long been interested in the relatively accessible study sites of Latin America, photographs of sites and people found their way to Brooklyn. Then in the 1970's, Ms. Millstein, who was blissfully aware of art, began collecting recent work from the region before it became fashionable.  One way or another, the museum acquired some telling images: 107 photographic prints and books from the collection are on view until Jan. 19 in ''Latin American Photography: A Spiritual Journey,'' organized by Ms. Millstein with historical material provided by Deirdre Lawrence, principal librarian at the museum.</p>

        <p>LITTLE-KNOWN fact of the week: the Brooklyn Museum established the first photographic department in an American museum in 1889, some 51 years before the Museum of Modern Art (which ordinarily gets the credit) had a department of its own. Brooklyn, however, was primarily a museum of natural history and anthropology, where you were as likely to see butterflies and bones as paintings of the American West. The Department of Photography, rich in ethnographic material, was blissfully unaware of art. In 1974, Barbara Head Millstein, the present curator, discovered a closet that had been locked since 1957; inside was the photographic collection, a good deal of which had been magically transformed into art in the interval by changing tastes and markets.</p>
        <p>Since anthropologists and ethnologists, inveterate collectors by profession, had long been interested in the relatively accessible study sites of Latin America, photographs of sites and people found their way to Brooklyn. Then in the 1970's, Ms. Millstein, who was blissfully aware of art, began collecting recent work from the region before it became fashionable.  One way or another, the museum acquired some telling images: 107 photographic prints and books from the collection are on view until Jan. 19 in ''Latin American Photography: A Spiritual Journey,'' organized by Ms. Millstein with historical material provided by Deirdre Lawrence, principal librarian at the museum.</p>
        <p>This show of Latin photographers and foreigners who came and stayed a while lacks a few of the great names but introduces some new ones. It makes a case, as might be expected, for a strong spiritual tradition and a more complex argument for a hybrid of Old and New World cultures. Nineteenth-century photographers in Latin America generally focused on monuments, buildings and cities. Foreigners mapped the ancient monuments; as early as 1843, engravings were made after Frederick Catherwood's daguerreotypes of Uxmal, and Alfred Percival Maudslay studied Chichen Itza in 1889.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the century, as anthropology solidified into a science, photographers grew interested in indigenous customs. The Brooklyn Museum's scientists and curators lapped up whatever looked like good evidence of places and people and customs, an impulse that also accounts for the wealth of remarkable colonial art recently on view at the museum in ''Converging Cultures: Art and Identity in Spanish America.'' Much of the art in that show, originally picked up as documentary material rather than art, had been languishing in the museum's basement for years.</p>
        <p>In the 20th century, photographers took on art, economic struggle, spiritual matters and psychological life.  Hidden in this show -- it is not entirely obvious in many pictures or spelled out in the labels -- is a photographic lesson quite similar to that of ''Converging Cultures'': that Latin America took extensively from European art but married it to native culture, sometimes an unlikely match. This is clear enough in the near-miraculous interplay of religions. Two small photographs taken by Juan L. Arauz in 1939 picture colonial baroque altars, those prodigal extravagances of saints and angels and gilt and hosannahs that turned the swell of European exuberance into a virtual inundation. In 1991, an American named Peter Kloehn made color photographs of Umbanda altars that adapted this already adaptive style to religions of a different stripe. Umbanda is an African-derived religion brought over by slaves. In one of these altars' tumultuous gatherings, Jesus carries his cross at the peak of the composition; Mary looks suitably motherly; the saints, in brilliant garments, stand by; blacks attend in white suits; North American Indians proudly wear their headdresses, and drums and fancy jugs are thrown in for good measure.</p>
        <p>Then there are two girls standing near the door of a Roman Catholic church in feather, embroidery and paper-flower headdresses that are certainly not standard-issue Catholic (Mariana Yampolsky, 1980's); Javier Silva Meinel's recent pictures of Peruvian rituals, said to be tied to Catholicism, one with a man in a trance while an enormous poisonous spider crawls over his face, another of a woman wearing a necklace of fish as she invites the sea to provide a good catch; and Graciela Iturbide's 1980's photograph of a sad Mexican woman holding a baby and wearing a crown of thorns, or her picture of a proud woman selling sisal, which frames her body like a shining pair of wings. A persistent devotion also shines from images of deserted, shuttered or ruined churches impeccably kept up by people who can no longer pray there.</p>
        <p>Latin photographic styles tend to be hybrid as well, frequently welding local traditions onto foreign models.  Latin America has long had close ties to Europe. From the 19th century on, people traveled or studied abroad, and at least from the 1920's numerous Latin American cities had steady access to European magazines and books. They also saw the imagery of foreigners like Paul Strand who paid lengthy visits.</p>
        <p>So Hugo Brehme, a German who lived in Mexico, taught Manuel Alvarez Bravo, the dean of Mexican photographers, and Alvarez Bravo taught his wife, Lola, who taught other Mexican women. (Women are exceptionally well represented in this show, both in quantity and quality.) Alvarez Bravo looked hard at work by Man Ray and other Surrealists, and an elusive Surrealism suffuses many Latin American photographs that do not even tamper with reality, like Iturbide's picture of a woman carrying a chicken past a wall covered with dripped paint that might well be blood, or Renata von Hanffstengel's image of a stairway leading up to a blank wall. Magic realism, you might call it.</p>
        <p>Foreigners and natives apparently photographed much the same things.  Death looms large in their pictures:  Bastienne Schmidt photographed a Colombian exhumation where the mourners were dismayed to find only a heap of clothing in the coffin, Alvarez Bravo depicted the Day of the Dead, Rosalind Solomon pictured a man about to be buried with a bottle of Pepsi.</p>
        <p>Insiders and outsiders both seem to have shared a vision of what was significant in these cultures. To a certain extent, they seem to have shared styles as well. But perhaps this is yet another example of borrowed or imposed European traditions thoroughly reconfigured on new soil. The native learns whatever the worldly foreigner has to offer and invents a new world from this knowledge. The outsider looking in at another culture finds it staring back.  Sometimes, eventually, it stares him down.</p>
        <p>''Latin American Photography: A Spiritual Journey'' remains at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, through Jan. 19.</p>
