        <p>To the Editor: The article "First U.S. Consulate Will Close Its Doors" (Travel Advisory, Jan. 28), about the consulate in Bordeaux, reminded me of my experience. I had the dubious honor and distinct displeasure of closing another  of our long-term consulates -- in Izmir, Turkey -- in 1993, when I was consul general there.</p>
        <p>The consulate in Izmir, then Smyrna, was established in 1803, with the appointment by Thomas Jefferson of the first consul, William Stewart of Pennsylvania. His mission was to promote trade between Turkey and the United States, to render service to American ships calling at Turkish ports and to protect American seamen. For 190 years, American consuls had been performing these duties in Izmir.</p>

        <p>By eliminating scores of American consulates and even some embassies, the Department of State budget-cutters are undermining efforts to reduce our chronic trade deficit. Such closures also deprive travelers of the security of American  consular assistance. While help may be available from embassy-based consular officers, they are often some distance from centers of tourism or commerce.</p>
        <p>To promote United States business, a consul in centers of commercial activity, and one who speaks the language and has excellent local contacts, can  do more than high profile trips by Washington-based senior officials.</p>
