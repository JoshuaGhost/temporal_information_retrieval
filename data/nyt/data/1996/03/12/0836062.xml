        <p>Athena Neuroscience Inc. announced today that it had received contingent approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its drug Zanaflex, a potential new treatment for spasticity resulting from spinal cord injury.</p>
        <p>In a letter, the agency told the company that approval was contingent on making final the labeling for Zanaflex and on Athena's agreement to collect additional data after the company begins marketing the drug. Athena, based in South San Francisco, said it expected to have the drug ready to market by the end of the year.</p>

        <p>Athena Neuroscience Inc. announced today that it had received contingent approval from the Food and Drug Administration for its drug Zanaflex, a potential new treatment for spasticity resulting from spinal cord injury.</p>
        <p>In a letter, the agency told the company that approval was contingent on making final the labeling for Zanaflex and on Athena's agreement to collect additional data after the company begins marketing the drug. Athena, based in South San Francisco, said it expected to have the drug ready to market by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>The thumbs up comes a year after the F.D.A. dashed the young company's hopes with a letter saying Zanaflex was not approvable because Athena had not provided sufficient clinical data to prove its effectiveness. Athena is also pursuing regulatory approval of Zanaflex in Canada and Britain.</p>
        <p>The company disclosed the F.D.A. letter after the stock market closed. Earlier, Athena's shares gained $2.125, or 15.7 percent, to $15.625, a 52-week high, in Nasdaq trading.</p>
        <p>While Zanaflex is not likely to be a huge drug in terms of total sales, analysts said, it was important to Athena to show that it could successfully shepherd a product through clinical trials and the regulatory process.</p>
        <p>"This is not a huge product for Athena, probably a $20 to $30 million drug by the end of the decade, and had the difficulties with the F.D.A. been greater there would have been questions about whether it was worth it to proceed," said  Edmund Debler, an analyst with Mehta &amp; Isaly. Nevertheless, the F.D.A.'s letter  "is clearly a positive," he said. "It says their intelligence and reading of the F.D.A. was right on," he added.</p>
        <p>Zanaflex is one of several drugs that Athena has licensed from other manufacturers in order to produce sales while it pursues development of its own  drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. Zanaflex is Athena's name for tizanidine hydrochloride, which is marketed in more than 50 countries by Sandoz Pharma Ltd. and its affiliates under the brand  names Sirdalud and Ternelin.</p>
        <p>"The approvability of Athena's first new drug application is an important milestone in our evolution," John Groom, Athena's president and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
