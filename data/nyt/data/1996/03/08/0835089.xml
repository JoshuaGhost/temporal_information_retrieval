        <p>Chungking Express" was shown as part of the 1994 New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 26, 1994. The film opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Lurching, vertiginous camera work is one hallmark of Wong Kar-wai's "Chungking Express," a film from Hong Kong with a tirelessly capricious sense of style. While its slender, two-tiered plot links love affairs that happen largely by accident, the film's real interest seems to lie in raffish affectation. Mr. Wong has legitimate visual flair, but his characters spend an awful lot of time  playing impish tricks. A film in which a man talks to his dish towel has an overdeveloped sense of fun.</p>

        <p>Chungking Express" was shown as part of the 1994 New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Sept. 26, 1994. The film opens today in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Lurching, vertiginous camera work is one hallmark of Wong Kar-wai's "Chungking Express," a film from Hong Kong with a tirelessly capricious sense of style. While its slender, two-tiered plot links love affairs that happen largely by accident, the film's real interest seems to lie in raffish affectation. Mr. Wong has legitimate visual flair, but his characters spend an awful lot of time  playing impish tricks. A film in which a man talks to his dish towel has an overdeveloped sense of fun.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wong displays aggressive energy, but his material is slight. In the first vignette, a mysterious blond-wigged moll oversees a comically intense drug-smuggling operation while a policeman mopes about the loss of his longtime  girlfriend. These two strangers will eventually fall in love, we are told.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the film displays the first sign of its fixation on canned goods as the policeman looks for pineapple with a certain expiration date, thinking that eating it will bring him luck in love. "I wonder if there's anything in the world that won't expire," he muses.</p>
        <p>This sentimental soul would seem to be no match for the drug dealer, who's so tough that she simply carts off a little girl when the girl's father behaves recalcitrantly. (After an ice-cream sundae, the little girl is returned.) When the cop and the blonde do meet, the encounter is archly effective, but it still  seems less consequential than the edgy, hyperkinetic mannerisms used to tell the story.</p>
        <p>The film's second section concerns a different policeman, whose romance with  a stewardess has become star-crossed, perhaps because when they met for a tryst, he played with a toy airplane. A pretty cook at a fast-food restaurant becomes obsessed with supplanting the stewardess in the cop's imagination. She sneaks into his apartment, touching and rearranging things until she seems to know everything about him. Wherever she goes, she likes to bop along to "California Dreamin.' "</p>
        <p>Beyond the Mamas and the Papas, "Chungking Express" is filled with global-village references to fast food, video, convenience stores, Bruce Willis  and Demi Moore. While Mr. Wong's visual energy harks back to early New Wave experimentation, it also has a substantial rock-video component, which suggests  that the detritus of mass culture has a way of coming home to roost.</p>
