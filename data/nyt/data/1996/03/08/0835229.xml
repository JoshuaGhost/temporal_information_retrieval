        <p>Germany's economy shrank in the fourth quarter of last year, the Government said yesterday. The economy shrank five-tenths of 1 percent from a quarter earlier, when growth was flat. Growth for all of 1995 was 1.9 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said.</p>
        <p>The lackluster final two quarters could increase fears that Germany is entering a recession, although the Government insists that is not the case. "There can be no talk of a slide into a recession, nor of zero growth for 1996," the Economics Minister, Gunter Rexrodt, said in a statement. A day earlier, the Government said that joblessness last month hit a new postwar high  of 4.27 million people, or 11.1 percent of the labor force.</p>
