        <p>Each afternoon, when classes are dismissed at the Junior-Senior High School here, Debra Cavanagh, a math teacher, gathers her things and her class list and  heads into the streets of this village to the homes of students who have not been doing their homework. Last week, she vowed to hit two homes a day and persuaded a science teacher to do the same.</p>
        <p>"The kids are coming in and saying: 'They've gone crazy. They're knocking on  our doors,' " she said. "We're doing what we can to raise the standards. We've got to get the message across."</p>
        <p>Almost two months into the state takeover of the Roosevelt school system --  the first such action in New York history -- teachers, parents and students say  they see signs of improvement in a district long plagued by low student achievement, rock-bottom morale and a sense of defeat.</p>
        <p>"There is more hope than doubt," said David Carroll, a high school teacher and president of the Roosevelt Teachers' Union.</p>
        <p>Under special legislation passed last year, the state was given unusual powers to intervene in Roosevelt, and the Board of Regents appointed a panel to  oversee a recovery plan for the district. Last month, with panel members asserting that the local school board had resisted the plan and was guilty of flagrant mismanagement, the Regents ousted the Roosevelt board, authorizing the  panel to run the district until new school board elections on May 21.</p>
        <p>Since then, change has come quickly. Safety and fire-code violations at the high school have been corrected; classrooms have received more supplies, including $146,000 worth of new textbooks; fire extinguishers are back in their  places along the high school's shabby green hallways; security guards are patrolling the building, and parents are volunteering to clean restrooms and organize fund-raising events.</p>
        <p>Until new textbooks were bought with Federal and state grant money that previous school board had not spent, teachers had complained that books, when available at all, were often 20 years old.</p>
        <p>Students and teachers expressed optimism that they said they had not felt in  years.</p>
        <p>"The halls are clean, and people want to keep them that way," said Lashae Eason, an eighth grader. "If we have a problem, we can stay after school. It feels better."</p>
        <p>Last week, administrators who assumed control of the district started an after-school program intended to prepare high school students for Regents exams  in the spring. Before the takeover, few of the advanced courses that would have  prepared students for the Regents exams were offered. Only about 1 percent of students passed enough Regents courses to succeed on the exams and earn Regents diplomas.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the second day of the program, Diane Costa-Robinson took a dozen  10th graders through 2,500 years of history -- from Pericles to President Clinton -- to prepare them for the Regents exam in global studies in May. Around the building, clusters of students crammed for exams in physics, chemistry, biology and French.</p>
        <p>"It's a challenge," said Ms. Costa-Robinson, who, like many other teachers, will now be required to teach Regents-level courses. "It's going to be a lot of  work."</p>
        <p>The change has come "too fast for me," she acknowledged, but she added, "Whatever the public demands is what you have to do when you're a schoolteacher."</p>
        <p>The task the students face -- a major exercise in catching up -- is not unlike the challenge the state has taken on. The Roosevelt takeover is a high-stakes endeavor that, if successful, will undoubtedly become a blueprint for future interventions in troubled school districts, and officials are finding that beneath the cosmetic improvements and the morale boost, much hard work remains to be done. It will take more than a few months to reverse problems created by rapid teacher turnover, lack of curriculum and poor morale.</p>
        <p>"So far, everybody is pleased," said Daniel A. Domenech, who heads the state  panel. "But as we get the first set of circumstances under control and come up for air, we're confronted with the larger and more significant issues. We have a long, long way to go."</p>
        <p>While major violations have been corrected, he said, millions of dollars in repairs are still needed in the high school and other buildings. The district is facing a deficit of $1.5 million, and the residents of Roosevelt, one of Long Island's poorest communities, are unlikely to vote for a budget increase to offset the shortfall, which Mr. Domenech said would be compounded by cuts in state aid.</p>
        <p>And with the financial constraints, the school board election fast approaching and officials wary of the long-term interventions that have yielded  mixed results in several New Jersey school districts, it is unclear how much can be accomplished before the elections and how far the state is willing to go to rescue Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>"I prefer to act with urgency to get in quickly, do what has to be done and get out," said Richard P. Mills, the State Education Commissioner. "The training wheels have to come off the bike. The community has to become responsible for the schools."</p>
        <p>Under the legislation, the three-member panel that is now running the district will revert to an advisory role when a new school board is elected. But some officials, mindful of the bitter power struggle between the panel and the former board that prompted the state takeover, are urging the Legislature to amend the law and extend the panel's authority beyond the election.</p>
        <p>"Three months is not enough time to turn around any institution," said Robert Francis, chairman of a citizens' advisory council that works with the state panel. "What if there's disagreement again? What if we have the same troubles? If the progress is reversed, we'll never have community support again."</p>
        <p>State education authorities are studying the possibility of modeling the panel after the emergency financial control boards that were created during fiscal crises to monitor budgets in New York City, Yonkers and Troy. Officials said they expected to decide on this within a few weeks.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, two ousted school board members are seeking $8 million in a lawsuit against state education administrators, calling the removal of elected officials a violation of their civil rights. The state has not yet responded to  the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>"We should never have been thrown out," said Seretta C. McKnight, the ousted  board president, who regularly attends school board meetings now held by the state panel.</p>
        <p>Ms. McKnight, who has repeatedly asserted that the state acted out of racism  when it moved to take over the mostly black school district, added: "It's a tragedy that this is 1996 and people are acting like it's 1876. It's a plantation mentality."</p>
        <p>While all this tempers the enthusiasm some feel about Roosevelt's future, many teachers and parents say they are trying to put behind them the years of anguish and frustration that preceded the takeover.</p>
        <p>"We still have problems, but you can't carry around problems that existed for years forever," said Ms. Costa-Robinson, the history teacher, who graduated from the high school and has taught there for 16 years. "You have to unload them, solve them and move on. The children are the name of the game."</p>
        <p>She paused, took a deep breath and turned back to her students. "O.K., people," she said. "I want to see some essay writing."</p>
        <p>Missions Accomplished</p>
        <p>In the two months since New York State ousted the Roosevelt Board of Education, administrators running the district have made these changes:</p>
        <p>* Corrected fire and safety code violations in the Junior-Senior High School.</p>
        <p>* Secured certificates of occupancy for all schools.</p>
        <p>* Hired 15 security guards to patrol high school hallways.</p>
        <p>* Spent $146,000 on textbooks.</p>
        <p>* Secured and distributed $1 million in Federal and state grants, including $283,000 that had not been spent over the last three years.</p>
        <p>* Began after-school tutorials to prepare high school students for Regents exams, and preparation classes for Scholastic Aptitude Tests.</p>
        <p>* Appointed lead teachers at high schools in all subjects.</p>
        <p>* Dismissed the Marriott Corporation as maintenance superviser after charges  that the previous school board illegally awarded the $1 million contract.</p>
