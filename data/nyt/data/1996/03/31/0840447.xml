        <p>A NEW means of attaching child-safety seats in cars could result in seats that are safer and easier to install.</p>
        <p>Child seats now buckle into a car's regular seat belts, and safety experts say they are often misinstalled, putting children at risk. Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration convened a panel of experts to examine ways to make child seats and vehicles more compatible.</p>
        <p>The panel soon determined that a car's safety belts should not be used to anchor the child seats -- because installation varied widely from car to car and seat to seat -- and it advocated the adoption of a European system called Isofix. The Isofix child seats have built-in steel bars that snap into special brackets in a car. Child seat makers and some auto manufacturers, including Ford, had pledged to move forward with the Isofix system by the 1998 model year.</p>
        <p>But since then, General Motors; Evenflo, a child-safety-seat maker, and some  suppliers of seat belt components have developed a prototype seat and anchor system. Their new seat has belts with buckles on each side that attach to two soft anchors in the space where a car's back and bottom seat cushions come together. To install the seat, an adult simply buckles the belts into the special anchors and pulls the straps tight.</p>
        <p>In clinics of 400 consumers recently conducted by G.M., the double-strap seat was deemed the most desirable of five prototypes. The Isofix seat was judged least desirable because of its weight, complexity and cost -- estimated at $175, compared with about $100 for the dual-strap seat.</p>
        <p>The moderator of the safety administration panel, Phil Haseltine, president of the American Coalition of Traffic Safety, said that before the dual-strap seat could go into production, it would require further engineering and testing. He said he was optimistic that the system could be in 1998-model cars, if the agency gave its approval. An agency official, Barry Felrice, said, "We're elated they have come up with an alternative that appears to be more user-friendly."</p>
