        <p>When the Oklahoma City bombing trial starts here this fall, anyone who shows  an Oklahoma driver's license at La Petite Cleaners will get 50 percent off on pressing and cleaning.</p>
        <p>"My heart goes out to those people," Maryann Chumley, the owner, said of bombing survivors and victims' relatives who plan to attend the trial. "I felt those families are already so devastated, and they aren't real well-to-do. They're working class."</p>

        <p>When the Oklahoma City bombing trial starts here this fall, anyone who shows  an Oklahoma driver's license at La Petite Cleaners will get 50 percent off on pressing and cleaning.</p>
        <p>"My heart goes out to those people," Maryann Chumley, the owner, said of bombing survivors and victims' relatives who plan to attend the trial. "I felt those families are already so devastated, and they aren't real well-to-do. They're working class."</p>
        <p>Denver never asked to serve as host for the trial of the two men charged with carrying out the worst terrorist attack in American history. But when the presiding judge, Richard P. Matsch, announced on Feb. 20 that the trial would be transferred here to insure an impartial jury, it struck a deep chord.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of Denverites have called social agencies to offer meals, bedrooms,  baby-sitting and transportation to and from the courthouse downtown. To ease the stress of the trial for the Oklahomans, one family has offered weekend use of a  90-acre ranch, and another family has offered the use of a house in Vail.</p>
        <p>"A minute after the news was announced on TV, the phones started ringing," said Matthew Bertram, spokesman for the American Red Cross here. "The first call I took was from a woman who was crying. She wanted to make sure the people would be taken care of. She later called back and offered her house."</p>
        <p>In two weeks, the local chapter of the Red Cross has received 1,250 firm offers of help for Oklahomans who want to attend the trial. About 700 offers have been received at another aid group, the Denver Victims Service Center. About 500 more people filled out coupons for "The Home Away From Home Program,"  a wide-ranging aid project started last month by The Denver Post and KOA Newsradio.</p>
        <p>Dozens more offers have come through private connections.</p>
        <p>"My former boss called from Greeley," said Paul Heath, president of the Murrah Building Survivors Association, an Oklahoma group that represents 250 people who survived the bombing of the Federal Building on April 19, 1995. "He is 91, and he just had a pacemaker put in. He said, 'We have a bedroom, we are one hour from Denver, and we want you to stay with us.' "</p>
        <p>Dr. Heath is a psychologist with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which was housed in the Federal Building, and he saw the floor break away eight feet from his desk in the explosion. He attributed the outpouring of support to the sense of powerlessness that many Americans felt after the bombing, which killed  168 people and wounded about 500.</p>
        <p>"Terrorism of this magnitude stirs up feelings of hopelessness," Dr. Heath said. "The people of Colorado feel the opportunity to do something about April 19."</p>
        <p>In Oklahoma City, the United States Attorney's office has a list of 2,200 people who are registered as victims, either by personal injury or by relationship to someone who died or who was wounded. Only a small fraction of them is expected to attend the trial, which could start here in October and last for more than six months. In the coming days, national attention will shift to Denver when the two defendants, Timothy J. McVeigh and Terry L. Nichols, are transferred here from El Reno, Okla.</p>
        <p>To help family members travel to Denver, United Airlines, which has the only  scheduled air service between here and Oklahoma City, will offer victims' family members round-trip tickets for $108. The current one-way unrestricted fare for the 90-minute, 500-mile flight is $439. Conoco, which has large oil and gas operations in Oklahoma, has given the United Way of Oklahoma $50,000 to help defray the travel and lodging expenses of families.</p>
        <p>In Denver, the city bus company plans to offer free passes and the regional telephone company, US West, plans to give the Oklahoma visitors free cellular telephones, calling cards and voice mail.</p>
        <p>The hotel nearest to the Federal Courthouse, the Embassy Suites Downtown, plans to provide free accommodations to Oklahoma families in five suites during  the trial. And the Apartment Association of Metro Denver, a landlords' group, has received commitments from apartment owners to provide 20 one-month rentals in downtown at no charge.</p>
        <p>"Our goal is 100 units for a month," said T. Jan Wiseman, executive vice president of the association. "A furniture rental company has agreed to provide  furniture,"</p>
        <p>For assistance from the Federal Government, Attorney General Janet Reno has set aside $200,000 from the Crime Victims' Fund, a Justice Department program, to help defray costs of Oklahoma families visiting here for the trial. Under a 1990 law, Justice Department officials are required "to make their best efforts" to see that victims are accorded certain rights, including "the right to be present at all court proceedings related to the offense."</p>
        <p>Representative Patricia Schroeder, Democrat of Colorado, has asked the Army to make housing available at the Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center, a suburban Denver military site being deactivated this year.</p>
        <p>In the coming week, Denver social agencies plan to announce a coordinating group for most of the aid here, the Colorado/Oklahoma Community Council.</p>
        <p>"No one is going to go wanting," said Chuck Green, a Denver Post columnist and an organizer of the overall aid effort, who has received hundreds of letters from readers offering help. "Several people who had suffered the loss of a child thought they would be specially prepared to host a family from Oklahoma."</p>
        <p>Jack Micheletti, a 60-year-old video salesman who lives in nearby Broomfield, has offered a bedroom in his house. "They are in trouble, and if I can help, I can help," Mr. Micheletti said, adding that he had been moved by television coverage of the bombing. "It's the first time I ever did anything like this."</p>
        <p>Edith Brown, a 60-year-old homemaker with five grown children, said of her offer to host a family: "I just felt people needed it. You only go through this  life once."</p>
        <p>Jannie Coverdale, an Oklahoma County clerk who lost two grandsons in the bombing and who plans to attend the entire trial, called the offers of help "wonderful."</p>
        <p>"I had the feeling that the defense attorneys were asking for the change of venue to Denver to keep us from attending the trial," Mrs. Coverdale said by telephone. "But since the people of Denver are being so nice to us, opening their homes, and offering us so much, it backfired on the defense attorneys."</p>
        <p>Oklahoma's two Senators, Don Nickles and James M. Inofe, both Republicans, have written Ms. Reno, asking her to arrange for a closed-circuit television transmission of the trial to a Oklahoma where it would be seen by only family members and survivors, since commercial TV cameras are banned from Federal courtrooms.</p>
        <p>"For those who can't go to Denver to attend the trial, a closed circuit site  would allow them to follow the trial on television," said Rick Fugitt, president of the Oklahoma Crime Victims Center, an aid group that was established three months before the bombing. "That way they could stay home with their families."</p>
        <p>For the moment, many Oklahomans are resigned to making the trek northwest to  Denver.</p>
        <p>"We get calls from people in Oklahoma City," said Mr. Bertram of the Red Cross. "They say, if you get one of those calls, just thank them for us."</p>
