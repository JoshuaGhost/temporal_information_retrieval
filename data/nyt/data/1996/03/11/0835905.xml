        <p>Peter, Paul and Mary take over public television's "Great Performances" tonight for a show called "Lifelines," a celebration of folk music going back at least as far as their early days in Greenwich Village. For anyone who prowled the folk scene in the 1960's, this is a joyful remembrance of things past. Not too long ago, the trio and their accomplished friends might have seemed like nostalgic artifacts. With the current downsizing of America, however, their voices and messages have regained stunning relevance.</p>
        <p>"Lifelines" is the title of an album Peter Yarrow, Noel Paul Stooky and Mary  Travers released last year. Remembering the struggles of the past and floating visions for the future, they were joined by old friends and young acolytes. Some like Judy Collins, Pete Seeger, Emmy Lou Harris and B. B. King are not on this television special. Others are: Ronnie Gilbert, Richie Havens, John Sebastian, Odetta, Tom Paxton and Dave Van Ronk.</p>

        <p>Peter, Paul and Mary take over public television's "Great Performances" tonight for a show called "Lifelines," a celebration of folk music going back at least as far as their early days in Greenwich Village. For anyone who prowled the folk scene in the 1960's, this is a joyful remembrance of things past. Not too long ago, the trio and their accomplished friends might have seemed like nostalgic artifacts. With the current downsizing of America, however, their voices and messages have regained stunning relevance.</p>
        <p>"Lifelines" is the title of an album Peter Yarrow, Noel Paul Stooky and Mary  Travers released last year. Remembering the struggles of the past and floating visions for the future, they were joined by old friends and young acolytes. Some like Judy Collins, Pete Seeger, Emmy Lou Harris and B. B. King are not on this television special. Others are: Ronnie Gilbert, Richie Havens, John Sebastian, Odetta, Tom Paxton and Dave Van Ronk.</p>
        <p>What emerges from the session is a crackling sense of family. Ms. Gilbert, once of the Weavers, says of the gathering, "These are our kids." The younger Mr. Sebastian describes his generation as "the next guys over the trench." Mr. Yarrow says: "The secret is we were never alone. We are part of a very big group." And either in performance, at Sony Studios in Manhattan, or in interviews taped at homes and apartments, the participants exude a sense of indestructible community. Coming off the exclusionary rantings of a Pat Buchanan, this gathering is a positive tonic.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, the old favorites. There's a medley including "Down by  the Riverside" and "We Shall Overcome," which concludes with a moving close-up of Odetta brushing away her tears. Mr. Paxton joins the trio for a stirring interpretation of Woody Guthrie's "Deportee," a tale of farm laborers that is described as being "today even more important as America turns its face from its immigrants and its migrant workers."</p>
        <p>And there is the younger generation, represented by Sally Fingerett, whose "Home Is Where the Heart Is" is sung splendidly by Ms. Travers, and Buddy Mondlock, who gets to sing his own "The Kid" with Peter, Paul and Mary. The common thread throughout the evening is the very simple concept of love. The idealism of the 1960's, innocent no doubt, perhaps even seemingly sappy in today's cynical climate, lives vibrantly in this unapologetic celebration. As Ms. Travers laughingly observes at one point, the only thing missing is "a Chianti bottle with candle wax dripping down its side."</p>
