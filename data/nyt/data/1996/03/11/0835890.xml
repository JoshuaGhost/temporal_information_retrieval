        <p>You may want to stash a couple of floppy disks in your memorabilia collection, next to the vinyl LP's and eight-track tapes, to someday show your grandchildren the quaint storage devices once ubiquitous in computers. Demand for the 1.44-megabyte, 3.5-inch floppy is on the wane.</p>
        <p>Part of the proof is Microsoft's winding down of its Canyon Park floppy disk  assembly plant in the Seattle suburb of Bothell, where 120 workers were recently let go.</p>
        <p>People who were doing a very good job for us simply were not busy enough,"  said Ray Emery, Microsoft's vice president for worldwide operations. He said the layoffs had brought the plant's payroll to 500.</p>
        <p>While the headcount will probably continue to decline over the next few years, Mr. Emery sees no immediate shutdown for the Canyon Park plant. After all, Microsoft only last year stopped shipping software in the antique 5.25-inch format that had been around since the 1981 arrival of the original I.B.M. PC.</p>
        <p>He expects a similarly protracted phaseout of the 1.44 megabyte, 3.5-inch disk, even as alternatives like 3M's new 120-megabyte disk come to the market. "Many of our customers who have older equipment still demand those disks," Mr. Emery said.</p>
        <p>These days, the floppy disk and its hard plastic cartridge are primarily a product of Asia. But assembly of packaged software is still often performed by American companies -- whether by hundreds of small contractors or by the software publishers themselves. Assembly includes copying the software to the disks, boxing it with manuals and shrink-wrapping the kit into the package that appears on retailers' shelves.</p>
        <p>Contractors that specialize in these tasks "will have to readjust to new media or close up shop," said Phil Devin, chief analyst of the data-storage market at the research house Dataquest in San Jose.</p>
        <p>Demand for CD-ROM's and other higher-capacity storage media is the main reason that demand for floppy disks is slowing.</p>
        <p>"Our specific orders today are running about 64 percent for CD's rather than  floppies, where it was about 31 percent exactly a year ago," Mr. Emery said. "If you bought a shrink-wrapped Windows 95, you might have a choice of one CD versus 25 floppies."</p>
        <p>Other trends affecting demand for floppies include the preloading of software on the hard disks of new personal computers, as well as the inclusion of a CD-ROM drive as standard equipment on new machines. In the corporate market, most customers obtain a license that enables them to load copies of a program onto users' computers through a network, rather than buying multiple copies. Demand for the PC disk drives that run 3.5-inch floppies is also slowing -- with worldwide unit sales growing at only 8 percent last year, down from 20 percent in 1994, according to Dataquest.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Emery of Microsoft sees the layoffs at Canyon Park as the beginning of the end of an era, he is not wistful.</p>
        <p>"I've been through 8 or 10 technology shifts," said Mr. Emery, who spent 20 years in the automotive industry before joining Microsoft. He likened the changes in data storage technology to the advent of aluminum in automobile engines in the 1970's. "It obsoleted the iron industry," he said. "But once we got through it, we had a lighter, better, more efficient vehicle."</p>
