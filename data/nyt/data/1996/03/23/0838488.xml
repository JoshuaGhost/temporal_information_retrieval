        <p>Federico Restrepo's Puppets and Drummers Dance Theater includes human beings  as well as puppets. And many instruments, in addition to drums, were heard in the taped collage that accompanied "Aguirre, the Spiral of the Warrior," which the troupe from Bogota, Colombia, presented on Thursday night at La Mama.</p>
        <p>Puppets, dancers and fantastic scenery created an illusion of mounting hysteria in this production, which Mr. Restrepo directed and choreographed. The  work was inspired both by the life of Lope de Aguirre, a 16th-century Spanish Conquistador, and by "Daimon," a novel about him by the Argentine writer Abel Posse. While traveling through the Amazon jungle, Aguirre rebelled against the Spanish monarchy to establish his own kingdom, and his strange career was reflected in hallucinatory choreography.</p>

        <p>Puppets, dancers and fantastic scenery created an illusion of mounting hysteria in this production, which Mr. Restrepo directed and choreographed. The  work was inspired both by the life of Lope de Aguirre, a 16th-century Spanish Conquistador, and by "Daimon," a novel about him by the Argentine writer Abel Posse. While traveling through the Amazon jungle, Aguirre rebelled against the Spanish monarchy to establish his own kingdom, and his strange career was reflected in hallucinatory choreography.</p>
        <p>Mr. Restrepo, who portrayed Aguirre, moved as if possessed by demons. Grotesquely masked and costumed dancers represented jungle beasts and plants. The wildness of the Amazon and the fanaticism associated with certain forms of Spanish Catholicism were evoked in sultry undulations, grim Inquisitorial processions and an episode in which the Conquistadors forced a sensuous and independent-minded woman (played by Maria Paulina de Zubiria) to become a nun.</p>
        <p>"Aguirre" resembled a nightmare. This was its weakness as well as its strength, for some of its scenes seemed odd merely for the sake of oddity. Yet all were hypnotic. Mr. Restrepo devised his impressive theatrical effects in collaboration with his brother Luis Alberto Restrepo, Rodrigo Lalinde and Ivan Cardozo.</p>
        <p>"Aguirre" continues through March 31 at La Mama, 74A East Fourth Street, East Village.</p>
