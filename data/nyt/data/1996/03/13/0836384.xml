      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Thomas P. Pollock has resigned as vice chairman of MCA Inc., the company said yesterday. No reason was announced for the resignation. He was appointed vice chairman of MCA in July, after joining the company in September 1986 and serving as executive vice president of MCA and chairman of the motion picture group. He  was also a member of the company's board. As chairman of the motion picture group, Mr. Pollock was credited with bringing creative talents to the studio. When the Seagram Company acquired 80 percent of MCA last year, Mr. Pollock became vice chairman, hoping to assume broader corporate responsibilities. But Edgar Bronfman Jr., chief executive of Seagram, has been assembling a new team,  and Mr. Pollock chose to resign. He had been a partner in the law firm of Pollock Bloom &amp; Dekom before joining MCA.</p>
