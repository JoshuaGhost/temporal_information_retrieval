        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A March 17 news article states that most of Taiwan's inhabitants "speak Taiwanese, not Chinese."</p>
        <p>Linguists agree that Taiwanese is a dialect of the Chinese language. There are more than 30 dialects of Chinese, including Taiwanese, Cantonese and Mandarin (the official dialect for Taiwan, Hong Kong and the People's Republic)  that have historically been unified by one common written language.</p>
        <p>In fact, Taiwanese is so similar to Fujianese, the dialect spoken by the population of the mainland, that Taiwanese speakers would have no trouble making themselves understood if they were to cross the strait.</p>
        <p>A college student you quote refers to Taiwanese and mainland Chinese as "different races," and you seem to support this claim by suggesting that many Taiwanese have roots that are "distantly Chinese." This ignores a point of history.</p>
        <p>The student's ancestors most likely were Han Chinese who left mainland China  300 years ago as part of an exodus instigated by the fall of the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) to the Qing forces, which were made up of Manchus, an ethnic group considered to be distinct from the Han Chinese.</p>
        <p>Though many crossed the strait to escape the poverty pervading southern China at the time, many settled in Taiwan because they did not want to live as subjects of rulers they considered foreign.</p>
        <p>The recent brouhaha over allowing the shipping of imperial treasures representing a millennium of Chinese art from the National Palace Museum in Taipei for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition in New York belies your article's implication that only a minority of the Taiwanese consider themselves  Chinese.</p>
        <p>As young Americans with roots that go back eight generations on Taiwan, we are disappointed in the historical, linguistic and cultural obtuseness some of our generational counterparts in Taiwan are displaying.</p>
