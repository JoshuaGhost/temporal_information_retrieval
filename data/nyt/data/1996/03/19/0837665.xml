        <p>The dollar rose against most leading currencies yesterday, bolstered late in  the day by surges in American stock and bond markets.</p>
        <p>The dollar was also helped by comments by a Bundesbank official that pointed  to lower German interest rates ahead.</p>
        <p>In late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 105.99 yen, from 105.93 yen  on Friday. The dollar also rose to 1.4753 German marks, from 1.4725 marks. But the British pound rose sharply against the dollar, climbing to $1.5325 from $1.5265.</p>
        <p>Analysts said the dollar was bolstered by a rise of 98.63 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at a record high of 5,683.60. Gains in American markets suggested increased demand for dollars from foreign investors.</p>
        <p>But market watchers also said that Wall Street's performance was not as important as the relative strengths and weaknesses of the German and American economies along with a change in trade flows with Japan.</p>
        <p>Ernest Welteke, a German monetary official, noting the lack of strength in his country's economy, raised the possibility of an interest rate cut there eventually. Lower interest rates make a country's assets and currency less attractive to investors, so his statements hurt the mark and helped the dollar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Welteke said lower rates could encourage investment and job growth in Germany, which is suffering from its highest unemployment levels since World War II. But he equivocated about whether the central bank actually would lower rates. Analysts have been expecting such a move for several weeks.</p>
        <p>The dollar's rise against the yen was helped by the Japanese Government's report yesterday that the merchandise trade surplus fell for the eighth consecutive month in February, dropping 46 percent, to $6.13 billion.</p>
        <p>The imbalance with the United States, Japan's largest trading partner, fell 29 percent.</p>
        <p>Also, the continuing tensions between China and Taiwan made the dollar a safe haven against the yen.</p>
        <p>"There is a slight upward trend developing in the dollar," said Randolph L. Donney, director of capital markets research for the Pegasus Econometric Group.  "But it's been a fairly lethargic kind of market."</p>
