        <p>A four-story apartment building on the East Side of Manhattan partially collapsed yesterday afternoon, apparently the result of the recent demolition of the building next door. While no one was injured, the collapse left 10 people homeless, many of whom came home from work to learn that the building would be demolished, with their life's belongings falling victim to a wrecking crane.</p>
        <p>Shortly after 10 P.M., workers began demolishing the building at 349 East 54th Street after city officials deemed it unsafe.  Residents were told that they would only be able to save what they could retrieve from the rubble.</p>
        <p>My whole life is there," said Kelvin Widdoes, 47, who has lived on the third floor of the building for two and a half years. "My clothes, my letters from childhood, my school reports. I have furniture specially made for me by friends, artwork. I've lost my life."</p>
        <p>Until recently, the collapsed building was the middle structure of three like-sized buildings, all of which were more than 100 years old, abutting one another on the north side of the street near the corner of First Avenue. Because of the danger posed by the imminent destruction of the collapsed building, the building immediately to the west, at 347 East 54th, which holds five apartments  and a French restaurant on the ground floor, was also evacuated yesterday.</p>
        <p>Residents of the collapsed building, some of whom were placed in hotels by the Red Cross, said the building immediately to the east, at 351 East 54th Street, had been standing empty for years and had been torn down during the last two or three weeks. The city's Buildings Department said the owner of 351 was listed as the Alrose Holding Corporation at 344 East 63d Street. But the telephone company had no listing for the company; its principal owner, Alfred Caiola, has an unlisted phone number in Manhattan. The corporation had a valid permit for the construction of a seven-story building on the site, said Charles  Strucken, a Buildings Department spokesman.</p>
        <p>"The question is did they go beyond the scope of work authorized by the permit," he said.</p>
        <p>By the end of last week, residents said, only a cavernous hole was left where the long-vacant building had been. But yesterday, workers removed a boulder from the hole, which apparently undermined the stability of the foundation of 349, causing the fundamentally sound building to begin collapsing, said Jerry Hauer,  director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management.</p>
        <p>It was unclear how many residents of the building were at home at the time of the collapse, which, Mr. Hauer said, happened in three separate surges.</p>
        <p>Last evening, residents milled around, frustrated, staring at their former home, a huge empty space where part of the foundation used to be, an enormous arched gouge in the side of the building.</p>
        <p>"The big issue is do I get my stuff out or not," said Mike Revock, a 26-year-old engineer who returned home from work only to be kept from entering the building where he has lived for a year and a half. He listened, a bit dumbstruck, as police officers explained that a crane was on the way to begin destruction of the building, that the rubble would eventually be dumped in the street and that residents would then be allowed to salvage what was salvageable.</p>
        <p>The activity caused quite a spectacle on the residential street, particularly as a crane began knocking down the building last night, with people standing on  their nearby terraces to watch the demolition. City officials kept the street closed off last evening and it was expected to remain closed today, though with  little further traffic distruption.</p>
        <p>As the building was being knocked down, the Fire Department started drenching the rubble with water to contain the dust. Pam Russo, Mr. Revock's roommate, said they decided to watch the building's demise.</p>
        <p>"We have to stick aroud," Ms. Russo said. "We want to see our apartment destroyed."</p>
        <p>Mr. Widdoes, a lawyer at the United Nations, said that he returned home for lunch at about 12:30 P.M., and that there was no sign of trouble, but that there were several men digging in the cellar with pickaxes. A friend heard a radio report of the collapse at about 4:15 P.M. and told him, Mr. Widdoes said, and he raced home immediately.</p>
        <p>"I have basic insurance, but nothing's insured for what it's worth," he said. "I have nothing left."</p>
        <p>According to the City Finance Department, which maintains property records, the owner of 349 is listed as Lawrence Yasuyo. But residents said the owner's name was George Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence himself was on the scene. He said he  had owned the building, with eight apartments, for 27 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawrence said he had had no communication with the owners of 351 about the demolition.</p>
        <p>"I don't own his building and he doesn't own mine," Mr. Lawrence said. "But he does have to build his building wthout destroying mine."</p>
        <p>Under control but visibly angry nonetheless, Mr. Lawrence said he did not know whether his insurance would cover the collapse. "If I have somebody going crazy with a bulldozer next to me, I don't know whether that's covered," he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawrence said he received a phone call just before 3 P.M. from one of the building residents informing him of the collapse. He said that workers, who had  been digging in the foundation hole next door, had run into the building, knocking on doors and shouting, "The walls are going to come down."</p>
