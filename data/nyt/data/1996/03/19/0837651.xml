        <p>IN a step that completes the first phase of the huge project to catalogue the human genes, scientists have published two comprehensive maps of mouse and human DNA.</p>
        <p>"These two maps have already changed the face of human and mouse biology," Dr. Elke Jordan and Dr. Frances S. Collins of the National Center for Human Genome Research in Bethesda, Md., wrote in an editorial accompanying publication of the maps in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>

        <p>IN a step that completes the first phase of the huge project to catalogue the human genes, scientists have published two comprehensive maps of mouse and human DNA.</p>
        <p>"These two maps have already changed the face of human and mouse biology," Dr. Elke Jordan and Dr. Frances S. Collins of the National Center for Human Genome Research in Bethesda, Md., wrote in an editorial accompanying publication of the maps in the current issue of the journal Nature.</p>
        <p>Information from the maps that was made available to scientists well before  publication has greatly speeded searches for single genes that cause disease, said Dr. Jordan, deputy director of the center. Dr. Collins is director. The information has also made it possible to look for genes that act together to contribute to other diseases, Dr. Jordan said.</p>
        <p>The research, Drs. Jordan and Collins wrote, has provided promising leads on  where to find genes affecting such disorders as juvenile-onset diabetes, schizophrenia and learning disability.</p>
        <p>Genes lie along microscopic structures called chromosomes, and the new maps reveal landmarks along chromosomes that can be used to zero in on genes. The mouse map gives 7,377 landmarks, the human map 5,264.</p>
        <p>In the genetic maps, each chromosome is depicted as a line, and the landmarks are located along it.</p>
        <p>The map for mouse DNA comes from Drs. William F. Dietrich, Joyce Miller, Eric S. Lander and their colleagues at the Whitehead-M.I.T. Center for Genome Research at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., and scientists elsewhere. It is important because studies of mouse genes give leads about human genetics.</p>
        <p>The human DNA map is from Dr. Jean Weissenbach, scientific director of the gene laboratory Genethon in Evry, France, with colleagues there and elsewhere in France and Canada.</p>
        <p>The next phase of the project is to produce more detailed maps called physical maps. The ultimate goal is to identify all of the estimated 100,000 human genes and find the details of their makeup by 2005.</p>
