        <p>The Procter &amp; Gamble Company said yesterday that it would reduce prices for its tissues, paper towels and bathroom tissues by at least 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble said that beginning with the April 22 shipments, list prices for Charmin bathroom tissue would drop an average 8.6 percent and would be cut an average 8.5 percent for Puffs facial tissues.</p>
        <p>Beginning with the June 3 shipments, Procter &amp; Gamble plans to cut the price of Bounty paper towels an average 4.8 percent.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble said the recent decline of pulp prices had reduced the cost  of materials. The company said it raised prices twice last year, in response to  rising pulp prices.</p>
        <p>The Kimberly-Clark Corporation, the world's largest maker of tissue products, declined to comment on whether it would respond by cutting prices on its Kleenex tissues, Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Viva paper towels.</p>
        <p>If Kimberly-Clark cuts its tissue and towel prices by 6 percent, the company's per-share earnings would fall 25 cents on an annual basis, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Company analyst, James Brucculeri, said in a report.</p>
        <p>Based on that assumption, Mr. Brucculeri reduced his earnings estimate for Kimberly-Clark to $4.85 a share from $5 for 1996 and to $5.55 from $5.80 for 1997.</p>
        <p>Shares of Kimberly-Clark, based in Irving, Tex., fell $3.625, to $74.125, while shares of the Cincinnati-based Procter &amp; Gamble fell $1.625, to $85.75.</p>
        <p>Seperately, Kimberly-Clark said yesterday that it planned a $172 million expansion of its tissue manufacturing operations in Beech Island, S.C.</p>
        <p>Procter &amp; Gamble's Bounty is the best-selling paper towel brand in the United States.</p>
