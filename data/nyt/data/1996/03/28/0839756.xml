        <p>A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled today that the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 gives the Justice Department authority to review changes in the rules for state party nominating conventions that may make it more difficult for some voters to participate.</p>

        <p>A sharply divided Supreme Court ruled today that the Federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 gives the Justice Department authority to review changes in the rules for state party nominating conventions that may make it more difficult for some voters to participate.</p>
        <p>The 5-to-4 decision brings nominating conventions within Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which applies to Southern states and to parts of some Northern ones, and bars any changes in voting procedures without the approval of the Attorney General or the Federal District Court here.</p>
        <p>The change at issue in the case was the imposition of a registration fee --  $35 or $45, depending on the voter's district -- to attend the party convention  at which Virginia Republicans selected their 1994 Senate nominee, Oliver L. North.</p>
        <p>The convention was open to any registered voter who paid the fee and declared an intention to support the Republican nominees. The fee, which had not previously been charged, was challenged by three law students from the University of Virginia, two of whom refused to pay and did not attend the convention and one who was advanced the money by the North campaign.</p>
        <p>The students brought a lawsuit contending that the fee was invalid because it was the equivalent of a poll tax, which is illegal under the Voting Rights Act,  and because approval had not been sought from the Attorney General.</p>
        <p>A three-judge Federal District Court in Virginia dismissed the suit on the ground that the preclearance requirement under Section 5 of the act did not apply to party conventions, and that the anti-poll tax provision could be invoked only by the Government, not by a voter.</p>
        <p>The Court overturned both of those conclusions today without an opinion that  commanded a majority of the Court. The principal debate among the Justices was over the First Amendment implications of making a party's internal affairs subject to scrutiny and potential regulation by the Government.</p>
        <p>The two opinions comprising the Court's majority -- one by Justice John Paul  Stevens, which Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined, and the other by Justice Stephen G. Breyer, which Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and David H. Souter joined -- portrayed the decision as a rather straightforward application of the Voting  Rights Act, though in a context the Court had not precisely addressed in earlier cases.</p>
        <p>Party conventions must be subject to Voting Rights Act review, both opinions  said, in order to avoid a return to the days of the "white primary," when unofficial associations of white voters in the South got together in advance to  anoint the candidate, who would then run unchallenged in a primary. Justice Breyer said that at the time the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965, "to have  read this act as excluding all political party activity would have opened a loophole in the statute the size of a mountain."</p>
        <p>The dissenting opinions painted a very different picture of today's decision, with Justice Antonin Scalia describing the plurality opinions as "remarkable departures from the settled course of our First Amendment jurisprudence" that turned the Voting Rights Act into a "classic prior restraint" and "makes citizens supplicants in the exercise of their First Amendment rights."</p>
        <p>The decision threatened not freedom of speech as such, but freedom of association among members of a political party, Justice Scalia said.</p>
        <p>Justice Clarence Thomas signed Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion and filed  one of his own, which Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Scalia also signed and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined in part. Justice Kennedy also filed his own dissenting opinion, joined by the Chief Justice.</p>
        <p>The volume of writing, five opinions totaling 113 pages and including many nuanced shades of difference, explained why this case, argued on the day the current term began last Oct. 2, was not decided before now.</p>
        <p>The practical impact of the decision, Morse v. Republican Party of Virginia,  No. 94-203, may be limited because only Virginia and Alabama, among the states subject to the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act, authorize party conventions for choosing nominees. Most states use primaries, which are clearly  covered by the act. Republicans in Virginia are in fact holding a primary rather than a convention to choose their Senate nominee this year, under a state law that gives the choice to the incumbent.</p>
        <p>The incumbent, Senator John W. Warner, selected a primary, a choice widely regarded as one that enhances his chances of getting the nomination against the  opposition of some more conservative party leaders.</p>
