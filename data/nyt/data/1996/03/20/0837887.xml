        <p>The dollar held steady against the Japanese yen yesterday, but fell against the German mark as the market wavered between buying on tensions in the Taiwan Strait and selling on lackluster American stocks and bonds.</p>
        <p>The dollar rose to a high of about 1.4805 marks and 106.45 yen in morning trading in New York, but relinquished its gains as Treasury bond and stock prices retreated.</p>
        <p>Really, what we have here is a market that's stuck," said Mark Gargano, managing director of foreign exchange at First Union National Bank.</p>
        <p>American and Swiss banks that had amassed dollars earlier sold them against the mark and the Swiss franc after the dollar failed to pass a psychologically important level of 1.4800 marks, traders said.</p>
        <p>"In the morning the Dow and bonds were higher, so that supported the dollar,  but around noon the stock market was sold off and the bond market was quiet, so  the dollar-mark went a little lower," Tadatoshi Taso, chief dealer with Bank of  Tokyo said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 14.09 points.</p>
        <p>In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar settled at 106.17 Japanese  yen, up from 105.99 yen on Monday. The dollar fell to 1.4730 German marks from 1.4753 marks. The British pound rose to $1.5335 from $1.5325.</p>
        <p>Jitters over tensions between China and Taiwan continued to support the dollar against the yen, dealers said.</p>
        <p>In the morning, rumors of a military incident in the Taiwan Strait and news that a Chinese container ship sank near an area where China is conducting war games propelled the dollar to a high of around 106.45 yen.</p>
        <p>The dollar later retreated, dragged down by flat American stock and bond prices and a decline against the mark.</p>
        <p>"I think the market is concerned about the possibility of America and China having a conflict, whether it ends up being trade sanctions or some kind of out-and-out dispute," Mr. Gargano of First Union said.</p>
        <p>But some traders said the dollar-bolstering effects of the China crisis were  wearing thin and, barring trade sanctions against China by Washington or an outbreak of military hostilities, the dispute was likely to fade as a factor.</p>
        <p>"I don't think it's a huge factor. said James Kemp, chief dealer at Citibank  "If you keep shouting wolf, the market stops flinching after a while."</p>
