        <p>The United States airline industry, buoyed by higher fares and strong passenger traffic, is poised to show its first profit since 1979 for the first quarter of a year.</p>
        <p>The unexpected performance by the industry was underscored yesterday when the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, said it expected its first-quarter results to exceed the estimates made by industry analysts, who raced yesterday to raise their projections.</p>
        <p>UAL did not give a specific figure on what it expected its quarterly earnings to be. The company did say, however, that the number would be more than the $2.05 a share that had been the highest estimate among Wall Street analysts.</p>
        <p>The announcement prompted a rally in airline stocks, with UAL shares posting  the group's largest gain. The shares of UAL closed at $213.125, up $8.875, or 4.4 percent. UAL's performance led the Dow Jones transportation average in a rise of 30.46 points, to a record 2,215.21.</p>
        <p>Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst with Salomon Brothers, predicted yesterday that the industry would earn $320 million in the quarter, in contrast  to a loss of $190 million in the first quarter of last year. "This is a major surprise," he said.</p>
        <p>United executives said the airline had been able to raise fares four times this year, for a cumulative increase of about 8 percent. Passenger traffic from  both business and leisure travelers has also been greater than expected.</p>
        <p>Those increases were reflected in broader industry statistics, as well.</p>
        <p>The Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, said yesterday that a combination of higher fares and increased traffic would result in a 13.7 percent surge in revenues for the airlines in February. Higher fuel prices would only slightly offset that gain, industry executives said.</p>
        <p>Another measure of the industry's health is the average percentage of seats filled. In February, this figure, known as the load factor, was 65 percent, compared with 61.9 percent in the corresponding period last year.</p>
        <p>Even with the fare increases, most travelers are not paying more to fly because a 10 percent Federal tax on airline tickets expired on Dec. 31. The absence of the tax has more than offset the fare increases, so that passengers have effectively saved 2 to 3 percent on their travel expenses.</p>
        <p>The good news for the industry has a downside for some carriers, however. Some airlines, like the American Airlines unit of the AMR Corporation and USAir, have been trying for some time to convince their employees that concessions from workers are needed to help lower costs.</p>
        <p>Such appeals for help ring somewhat more hollow with the industry enjoying unexpectedly good times, said J. Randolph Babbitt, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, the largest pilots' union.</p>
        <p>"It's difficult to convince an employee group that we're making pretty good money right now, but nevertheless, the need remains to get our cost structure competitive," he said.</p>
        <p>UAL also said yesterday that it would redeem its 6 3/8 percent convertible subordinated debentures, reducing its gross interest expense by $38 million a year. The move is part of an effort to improve UAL's credit rating through debt  repayment and other moves. That effort began in July 1994, when employees made concessions in exchange for a majority stake in the airline.</p>
