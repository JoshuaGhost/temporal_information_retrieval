        <p>This pretty, rusting city beside the Mohawk River is going broke. A few months ago, it used $3 million set aside for a new courthouse and other construction projects to pay bills. This month, it managed to pay its employees  only because the state speeded up a chunk of aid.</p>

        <p>This pretty, rusting city beside the Mohawk River is going broke. A few months ago, it used $3 million set aside for a new courthouse and other construction projects to pay bills. This month, it managed to pay its employees  only because the state speeded up a chunk of aid.</p>
        <p>And so, facing a deficit said to exceed 10 percent of Utica's $36 million budget, Mayor Edward A. Hanna proposed the unthinkable. He proposed eliminating  spending on the Utica Public Library, the zoo and the children's museum. Even worse, to many here, he proposed laying off police officers and firefighters.</p>
        <p>The Mayor's prescription provoked such a storm of outrage that the city's Common Council basically ignored it and, last week, rolled back the cuts -- without, as even the Council president acknowledged, resolving the lurking deficit.</p>
        <p>"By August, we're going to be absolutely broke," the Mayor said after the Council's vote, voicing a fear his opponents say is exaggerated but one supported by fiscal monitors such as the state's Comptroller, H. Carl McCall.</p>
        <p>And Utica may not be alone. A fiscal crisis, like the one that racked New York City in the 1970's, has gripped the state's smaller cities, making this city's convulsions far from extraordinary.</p>
        <p>With alarming frequency, cities like Utica, Rome, Schenectady and Niagara Falls have found themselves staggering under the crush of budget deficits. In the last two years, the finances of Troy and Newburgh degenerated so badly that the state stepped in, creating fiscal oversight agencies like the ones that have monitored New York City and Yonkers for two decades.</p>
        <p>The crisis, simply, reflects the fact that the cost of providing municipal services has risen as rapidly as revenue from taxes and state and Federal aid has fallen.</p>
        <p>More broadly, however, it reflects the gnawing decline of the state's urban cores, as the economy lurches along, property values fall and companies, jobs and finally people pack up for the suburbs or other states. And that, according  to the cities' advocates, threatens to erode the state's overall economic viability.</p>
        <p>"It's not just an isolated problem in a few cities," said Peter A. Baynes, the deputy director of the New York State Conference of Mayors in Albany. "It's  really something that's happening across the state."</p>
        <p>The crisis has forced many cities to raise taxes, despite the prevailing antitax climate, or to make cuts in core services once thought politically untouchable. In some cases, they have done both, causing considerable voter anguish while barely denting the problem.</p>
        <p>Schenectady raised property taxes 4 percent and laid off 19 firefighters earlier this year. Last week, the new Mayor of Troy, Mark P. Pattison, let go eight police officers, including the entire mounted unit, despite having raised  property taxes 21 percent and water rates 38 percent. And Troy still faces a deficit.</p>
        <p>Cities' Declines Worse Than State's</p>
        <p>In a survey of 25 of New York's cities, released last Friday, Moody's Investors Service found that "most are struggling to maintain fiscal balance" and concluded that would continue.</p>
        <p>"While the state's economic growth has lagged behind that of the nation, cities' declines have been greater and more extensive than the state's," the credit-rating agency said in its weekly report, "Credit Perspectives." And, the  report said, "New York cities will likely continue to function under a high level of stress for at least the next several years."</p>
        <p>The scope of the crisis seems small compared with the more prominent woes of  the state's larger cities, particularly New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has had to wrestle down annual budget gaps of $2 billion to $3 billion. In many ways, however, the solutions are more elusive.</p>
        <p>While the crisis predates the current budget impasses in Washington and Albany, today's political realities have all but erased hope for a bailout from  above. Nor is there much hope that the state's economy will turn around soon. According to budget experts, the fiscal troubles in the smaller cities may hamper a recovery by forcing out more jobs and people.</p>
        <p>"That's really the fear," Mr. McCall said. "As you increase taxes and depress services, then you lose population. The downward spiral continues."</p>
        <p>New York's cities, like those throughout the Northeast, have been struggling  for decades, of course, as urban ills have spread and the middle class has fled. But the new crisis stems from two specific, related events in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>First, the state, under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, began to cut its aid to local governments, which relied heavily on it to supplement their budgets. The aid, known as revenue sharing, has fallen by nearly half since 1989, to slightly more than $500 million this year.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the state's economy fell into a recession from which it has not yet recovered. That has eroded property values, the major source of tax revenues, especially for smaller cities. It has also driven out factories and businesses, further cutting tax revenues by shrinking the tax base.</p>
        <p>64% of Cities Had Property-Value Fall</p>
        <p>In a report last month, the Conference of Mayors found that 64 percent of the state's cities had a decline in property values in the last year alone, accelerating the trend that began in the early 1990's.</p>
        <p>Edward C. Farrell, the group's executive director, said the erosion had forced cities to raise property taxes on the properties that remained to keep the same revenue level. With the reductions in state aid, he said, the cities can no longer raise enough to pay the rising cost of basic services, like garbage collection and public safety.</p>
        <p>Even with rising taxes and budget cutting, some cities have not been able to  keep up. In the last five years, six cities -- Gloversville, Jamestown, Newburgh, Rome, Troy and Utica -- have had to borrow money to cover operating deficits. Deficit financing, which requires approval from the State Legislature, provides an infusion of cash but at future costs and thus, to fiscal monitors, reflects grave instability.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki's new budget proposal offers little prospect of immediate help for the cities, although for a second year the Governor did not cut revenue sharing any further. Instead of aid, he proposed easing state mandates on things like construction projects and union arbitration. Those proposals, however, face opposition in the Legislature and, even if passed, might not produce significant savings quickly.</p>
        <p>The Governor's budget did include $25 million in emergency aid for "distressed" local governments, but he reduced it to $10 million when revising his budget this month. And it remains unclear which cities would get it. "All of our members," Mr. Farrell said, "assume they qualify as distressed."</p>
        <p>Utica's troubles are not unlike those facing most of the state's Rust Belt cities, the hubs that had thrived on industry since the 19th century. Since 1970, however, Utica has lost nearly 60 percent of its manufacturing jobs, according to the Moody's report, as well as 20,000 or so residents, leaving it with 68,000 today.</p>
        <p>Buildings Are Empty On a Main Street</p>
        <p>The outward signs of Utica's decline are everywhere. Along its commercial spine, Genesee Street, buildings stand empty, including the downtown's 14-story  pride, the Bankers Trust Building. The city has 300 abandoned buildings, many in need of demolition.</p>
        <p>Since the recession began, according to the Conference of Mayors, the city's  property tax base has eroded 7.2 percent. The result, city officials said, was a $2.6 million drop in property tax revenue, to around $15 million a year.</p>
        <p>All the while, the cost of services has continued to rise, mainly driven by salaries and benefits for unionized employees, including those for firefighters  and police officers, which are mandated by the state's binding arbitration process.</p>
        <p>Utica's fiscal problems, brewing for years, became more public last November, with the election of Mr. Hanna, an iconoclastic 73-year-old businessman who won  a three-way race for Mayor as an independent.</p>
        <p>After taking office in January, he declared the city on the brink of bankruptcy and proposed his painful budget for the fiscal year beginning in April, cutting the city's spending by $1.5 million in all.</p>
        <p>"Listen, a city is not a city without the library," Mr. Hanna said, referring to his plan to eliminate city support for the library on Genesee Street, cutting $483,000 of its $700,000 budget. "But that's how broke we are."</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanna's budget shocked almost everyone. Angry protests arose. A campaign  to save the library began. A petition to save the Utica Zoo went around. More important, the unions lobbied the Common Council to reverse proposed layoffs of  nearly 100 of the city's 600 employees.</p>
        <p>"The condition of the city is not great," said Anthony F. Zumpano, the president of the Utica Professional Firefighters Association. "But it's not time to throw in the towel yet."</p>
        <p>By the time it voted at a crowded meeting last Wednesday night, the Council had restored most of the Mayor's cuts. (The library still lost a little money and announced it would close its two neighborhood branches.) The Council did so  by doubling parking fines to $20, hoping to raise $200,000, and by tapping Federal grants set aside for community development.</p>
        <p>In approving the budget, however, Council members acknowledged that they had  still neither covered a $1 million deficit left from this fiscal year nor repaid the $3 million taken from the capital fund. What is more, the new budget did not take into account at least $1 million in expenses expected in the coming year.</p>
        <p>"We are human beings," Councilman Roger F. Amodio, a Republican, said, explaining the Council's reluctance to cut so drastically, even if holes remained. "We've done the very best we could with a bad budget."</p>
        <p>It may not be enough. Unless Utica soon finds a way to cover its deficit, it  may run out of cash to pay its bills, including those for the construction of its courthouse, for two new fire trucks to be delivered this spring and even for the payroll.</p>
        <p>Utica's scramble raises the specter of a state takeover, like the one in Troy last year. That city, on the Hudson near Albany, had run up deficits for six straight years until it accumulated a $12 million deficit, more than a quarter of its budget, and risked defaulting on its bonds.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, the Legislature created a board, headed by the State Comptroller, to review Troy's finances. Last year, with little improvement apparent, the board's powers were expanded to give it near-veto power, forcing the Mayor and Council to face up to the city's problems.</p>
        <p>With the creation of the Troy Municipal Assistance Corporation, like the one  that bailed out New York City in the 1970's when it could no longer borrow money to pay its bills, the city may manage to avoid a default. But it is not out of the woods. More cuts and higher taxes are likely.</p>
        <p>"I don't think people have a real sense of the depth of the crisis," said Mr. Pattison, a Democrat who became Mayor in January.</p>
        <p>Trying to avoid a repeat of Troy's near-collapse, the Comptroller has proposed legislation that would create a more uniform process for reviewing cities' finances, rather than leaving it to the Legislature to address case by case. Mr. McCall has said he hopes the process would identify crises in the making, like Utica's, and provide help before cities reach the brink.</p>
