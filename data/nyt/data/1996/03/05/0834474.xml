        <p>Gold prices fell yesterday to their lowest levels in two months as a New Year's rally that had carried the market to six-year highs faded, and disappointed investors scrambled to sell.</p>
        <p>"People were getting impatient, and the price of gold wasn't going anywhere," said Greg Drury, director of precious metals at Mitsui &amp; Company in the United States.</p>
        <p>At the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for April delivery tumbled $5, to $395.20 an ounce, the lowest since Jan. 3 and off nearly $25 from the six-year high of $419.60 reached on Feb. 2.</p>
        <p>With energy and grain prices also falling, the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 17 commodities dropped 0.85, to 243.61.</p>
        <p>Other precious metals prices also fell. May silver lost 12.3 cents, to $5.417 an ounce, and April platinum dropped $4.80, to $408 an ounce.</p>
        <p>Dinsa Mehta, managing director at Chase Manhattan, said the gold market seemed overbought recently, but traders and analysts said there was no fresh news behind the selloff.</p>
        <p>Bullish investors had focused on expectations that gold mine output would remain stagnant while buying in the fast-growing Asian economies would continue  rising. But the continuing strength in the stock market deflated expectations that investors would move into hard assets like gold.</p>
        <p>Crude oil prices fell further, casting doubt on whether the energy sector would mount a late winter rally.</p>
        <p>April crude lost 24 cents, to $19.20 a barrel, and April gasoline declined 1.02 cents, to 58.73 cents a gallon at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
        <p>Grain prices fell, hurt partly by moves by two large poultry producers to reduce output, partly because of the high cost of chicken feed made from corn and soybeans.</p>
        <p>The approach of the South American soybean harvest also weighed on prices, with March soybeans falling 8 cents, to $7.2025 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade. March corn fell 4 cents, to $3.8925 a bushel, and March wheat declined 3  cents, to $5.1225 a bushel.</p>
