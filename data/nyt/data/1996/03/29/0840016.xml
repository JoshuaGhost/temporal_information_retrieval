        <p>Dona Nelson 'Paradox Lake' Michael Klein 40 Wooster Street, near Grand Street SoHo Through April 6</p>
        <p>A survey of Dona Nelson's quarter-century pursuit of painting would be extremely interesting right now. Since the late 1960's, this idiosyncratic artist has zigged and zagged between abstraction and representation, cultivating an elliptical imagery and a physically explicit painting process while shunning  traditional notions of beauty with unusual techniques and materials.</p>
        <p>Her most recent paintings, gathered into a series titled "Paradox Lake," exude Ms. Nelson's characteristic homespun energy and hard-won sophistication. Often made with the canvas positioned on the floor, they contrast control and accident; luminous stains of color with thick, glossy, almost sculptural shapes. They may be finished off with skeins of thin skitterish pencil lines, or with crumpled bits of paper or fabric that may have been used to apply paint. (This seems to be the case with "Bell Bird.")</p>
        <p>In "Knight," a patchy gray sky, punctuated by moonlike circles of raw canvas, is contrasted with a flat floating blue shape pinioned by additional circles of  white, these smooth and raised, like milky hubcaps. It's like watching a circus  sneak into town at night, with the piece of fabric twisting across the gray suddenly suggesting a partly installed tightrope, as well as a bit of cloud. In  "Paradox Lake," a mintish green is broken by big, corroding blobs of lavender, as if bubbling up from underneath. And in "Night Ramble," a similar green has been dammed up by an undulating edge of cloth, forming a literal, if now dry, lake of color.</p>
        <p>Much of the power of Ms. Nelson's work lies in her ability to freeze-frame the painting process, revealing it as a series of discrete and nonlinear acts and decisions. This relates in some ways to the work of Jackson Pollock and David Salle. She seems to work with the conviction that there are numerous things Pollock never got around to doing, and others that may not occur to men as readily as to women.</p>
