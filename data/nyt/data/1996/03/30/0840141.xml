        <p>A document recommending the awarding of two city contracts to a Queens social service agency was signed last summer by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's top aide.</p>
        <p>It is not clear whether the aide, First Deputy Mayor Peter J. Powers, was aware of the problems with the contracts that resulted in their cancellation this week. Mr. Powers routinely signs many contract recommendation forms on the  Mayor's behalf, and other mayoral aides have said City Hall was unaware of the entire issue until asked about it by newspaper reporters.</p>
        <p>But City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi, whose office provided copies of the recommendation documents yesterday, said he believed Mr. Powers's signature showed that City Hall was aware last August that the Queens group was getting the $43 million contracts, which were part of an ambitious city effort to turn supervision of thousands of welfare recipients over to private agencies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers did not return phone calls seeking comment after messages were left yesterday with the Mayor's press office.</p>
        <p>The contracts, among the largest efforts by the Giuliani administration to privatize a government service, were canceled on Wednesday by Mr. Giuliani, after it was disclosed that officials had broken city bidding rules in awarding  them. Several former city officials and the son of one of the Mayor's oldest friends had also been hired by the agency that won the contracts.</p>
        <p>Some senior mayoral aides have said this week that they knew no details of the bidding for the contracts, which took place from February through August of  last year.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Schwartz, a senior adviser to the Mayor who oversees privatization efforts, changes in the welfare program and other attempts to re-invent government, said that he had no role in the awarding of the contracts to the Hellenic American Neighborhood Action Committee, or Hanac.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Giuliani said, while announcing the cancellation, that he had been unaware of irregularities in the contract competition until he had read about them in the newspaper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hevesi, a Democrat who has sometimes been at odds with the Republican Mayor, said that Mr. Powers's signatures, dated Aug. 28, 1995, suggested that he must have known something about the contracts.</p>
        <p>"The signature of the First Deputy Mayor on the cover sheets contradicts the  Mayor's assertion that City Hall was not involved in the decision-making process," Mr. Hevesi said.</p>
        <p>The City Charter requires the signature of either the Mayor or Deputy Mayor to approve the awarding of all contracts that are worth more than $2 million and that are not awarded through sealed, competitive bids. Under that provision, Mr. Powers or Mr. Giuliani would be required to formally approve, with their signatures, dozens of contracts a month.</p>
        <p>Federal and state prosecutors have begun investigations into how the two contracts were awarded to Hanac. Mr. Giuliani also asked the city's Department of Investigation to look into the contracts.</p>
        <p>Among the irregularities in the awarding of the contracts was that Hanac submitted the highest bid among the three finalists and was rated only second by four of five members of a city evaluation committee. City officials did not formally evaluate the competitors' final proposals, as required by city bidding  rules, nor did they conduct a financial analysis that would explain why Hanac's  bid -- $8 million higher than the next highest offer -- would be more cost-effective for the city.</p>
