        <p>Bevon Robin scored a game-high 24 points, including the winning basket with 1.3 seconds left in overtime, to help Rice pull off a stunning 64-63 victory yesterday over Christ the King, the nation's second-ranked team.</p>
        <p>The victory at Fordham University gave Rice (21-5) its second Catholic High School Athletic Association Class A basketball title in three years. It also earned the Raiders a trip to the New York State Federation Tournament in Glens Falls on Friday. Rice will take on Erasmus Hall (15-12), the Public Schools Athletic League Class A champion, in the state semifinals.</p>
        <p>For Christ the King (26-1), considered by many to be the best city basketball team in a decade, the upset was a bitter end to what had been a perfect season. Rice led from the opening tipoff against the team rated one place behind St. Anthony of Jersey City for the country's top spot. The Raiders  jumped out to a 12-2 lead and led most of the first half until Christ the King tied the score at 31-31. Rice escaped the half with a 33-31 lead.</p>
        <p>In the second half, the teams traded baskets as the lead seesawed and the game headed into overtime. Christ the King appeared to take the final lead when  Ira Miller (19 points) hit two foul shots to put his team up, 63-62, with 7.8 seconds remaining in overtime.</p>
        <p>But that is when Robin, the game's most valuable player, drove the length of  the court and banked in the winning shot.</p>
        <p>Tariq Kirksay added 17 points, 7 rebounds and 4 blocked shots for Rice.</p>
        <p>Christ the King's high scorers were Miller and Craig Claxton, who had 19 points apiece.</p>
