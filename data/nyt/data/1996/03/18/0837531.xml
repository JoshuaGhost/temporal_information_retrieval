        <p>THE high-tech marketer that urges computer users to insist on "Intel inside"  has unexpectedly consolidated its advertising at a global giant, but in a twist  will not leave its small American agency on the outside.</p>

        <p>THE high-tech marketer that urges computer users to insist on "Intel inside"  has unexpectedly consolidated its advertising at a global giant, but in a twist  will not leave its small American agency on the outside.</p>
        <p>The Intel Corporation, which dominates the microprocessor market with its powerful Pentium chip, named Euro RSCG in Paris to handle its worldwide account, with billings estimated at more than $100 million. Intel, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., selected Euro RSCG -- the world's seventh-largest agency company -- to handle the creative and media portions of the account in all countries except Japan, where Dentsu Inc. in Toyko will remain on the Intel roster.</p>
        <p>Intel has worked with Euro RSCG in the Asian and Pacific markets outside Japan since 1991 and recently began a relationship with it in Brazil. Intel now  becomes one of the five largest accounts of Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising that also creates campaigns for blue-chip clients like the MCI Communications Corporation, Philips Electronics N.V. and the Procter &amp; Gamble Company.</p>
        <p>"We wanted a unification of our worldwide efforts," Dennis Carter, vice president and director for corporate marketing at Intel, said in a telephone interview from Hanover, Germany, where he was attending Cebit, the giant information technology fair and trade show.</p>
        <p>"The products change very fast, and the marketplace changes very fast," he added. "One of our biggest challenges is keeping consistency worldwide in our positioning and overall brand values, so having a centralized agency approach feels very right."</p>
        <p>By consolidating its account, Intel joins a lengthening list of large marketers, ranging from Colgate-Palmolive and Eastman Kodak to Kimberly-Clark and I.B.M. Such consolidations typically result in smaller shops being supplanted by bigger competitors.</p>
        <p>But Intel will continue its six-year relationship with its small American shop, Dahlin Smith White in Salt Lake City, which helped transform computer chips from a commodity to a premium branded product by creating the "Intel inside" campaign. Dahlin Smith has billings of $130 million at the single Utah office, compared with Euro RSCG's billings of $6.2 billion at 62 offices in more than 30 countries.</p>
        <p>The reason Intel and Dahlin Smith will remain together is that Euro RSCG has  acquired a majority interest in Dahlin Smith, which was founded in 1986 to specialize in technology accounts. The agency -- which began with three employees and two PC's, according to a history compiled for Dahlin Smith's 10th anniversary -- now has 134 employees working for high-technology marketers  like Intel, Bay Networks, Iomega, Netscape Communications and Sybase.</p>
        <p>"This gives us the opportunity to continue using D.S.W., but in an international context," Mr. Carter said. "It's really great news." Some Dahlin Smith campaigns have already appeared overseas, he added. The alliance with Euro RSCG is likely to expose even more PC shoppers to the "Intel inside" sales pitch.</p>
        <p>Indeed, as Intel was announcing the consolidation, the company was introducing a worldwide consumer campaign by Dahlin Smith and Euro RSCG that carries the theme "Pentium processor: On the 'Net/Off the 'Net." The campaign features the redesigned Intel site on the World Wide Web of the Internet.</p>
        <p>Under the consolidation, Dahlin Smith has been designated as the regional brand management agency for Intel in North America. In Europe, Euro RSCG takes over from Publicis S.A. in Paris.</p>
        <p>In Latin America, the Euro RSCG office in Sao Paulo, Brazil, takes over from  DPTO Propaganda and Marketing in Sao Paulo and Adler Publicidad de Occidente S.A. de C.V. in Mexico City. And in Asian and Pacific markets outside Japan, the account will remain with Euro RSCG Ball Partnership Ltd. in Hong Kong.</p>
        <p>The terms of the agreement under which the privately held Dahlin Smith is selling the majority stake to Euro RSCG are not being disclosed.</p>
        <p>Mary Kay Lazarus, a spokeswoman for Dahlin Smith, said on Friday that John D. Dahlin, president, and Jon M. White, executive vice president for creative services, could not discuss the deal until today, after they had completed meetings in Paris with executives of Euro RSCG. Darrell H. Smith, executive vice president and account services director, was also unavailable, she added, because he was traveling.</p>
        <p>Usually, top managers who keep a firm grip on their largest client during a consolidation are quite willing to babble about their brilliance. But the reticence of Messrs. Dahlin, Smith and White should not be surprising; after all, their agency asserts that its initials stand for "Do Something Wild."</p>
        <p>In joining the Euro RSCG ranks, Dahlin Smith becomes a sibling shop of American agencies like Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG in New York, Tatham Euro RSCG in Chicago and the New York health care advertising agencies Robert A. Becker Inc. and Lally, McFarland &amp; Pantello.</p>
