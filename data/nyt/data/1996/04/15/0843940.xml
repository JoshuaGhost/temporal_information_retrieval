        <p>Taiwan plans to buy 300 more M60-A3 tanks from the United States to strengthen its defenses, a leading Taiwan newspaper reported today.</p>
        <p>The newspaper, United Daily News, quoted unidentified military sources as saying the American-made tanks, which are more than 10 years old, would replace older vehicles. The Defense Ministry was not available for comment.</p>
        <p>In a deal struck in 1994, Taiwan agreed to buy 160 M60-A3 tanks from the United States for $590,000 each. The tanks are due to be delivered by next month, the newspaper said.</p>
        <p>Tensions between Taiwan and China escalated last month when Beijing held war  games and missile tests in the narrow Taiwan Strait around the time of Taiwan's  presidential election on March 23.</p>
        <p>China has regarded Taiwan as a renegade province since the civil war between  Communist and Nationalist forces ended in 1949 with the Nationalists fleeing to  the island. Beijing's recent military exercises were intended to deter Taiwan from pursuing independence.</p>
        <p>Tensions have eased since after the election and both sides have talked of the need for greater dialogue.</p>
