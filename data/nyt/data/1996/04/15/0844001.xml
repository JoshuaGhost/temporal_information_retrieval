        <p>Bulls 98, Cavaliers 72</p>
        <p>The question has been following the Chicago Bulls all year: Are they the best ever? They could not have answered it any more emphatically yesterday.</p>
        <p>"We've come out and proven that we're the best of all time," Scottie Pippen  said after the Bulls reached the threshold of National Basketball Association history with their record-tying 69th victory, beating the host Cleveland Cavaliers, 98-72.</p>
        <p>Michael Jordan led the way with 32 points and 12 rebounds as the Bulls matched the 69 games won in 1971-72 by the Los Angeles Lakers of Wilt Chamberlain and Jerry West.</p>
        <p>"We felt we had a chance to win a championship and weren't thinking in terms  of 69 or 70 wins," Jordan said. "But when you go this far, you have a chance to  make a mark on history. Still, we don't want to lose our focus, and that's to win a championship."</p>
        <p>Chicago, which has four games left, could set the record tomorrow night at Milwaukee. The Bucks stunned Orlando last night in Milwaukee, 114-101, after the Magic's Anfernee Hardaway left just 2 minutes 45 seconds into the game because of his sprained right ankle.</p>
        <p>History aside, yesterday's game actually meant more to Cleveland, which dropped a game behind New York in a four-way race that includes Atlanta and Detroit for the fourth playoff seeding in the East and home-court advantage in the first round.</p>
        <p>Chicago swept the four games of the season series with Cleveland by an average of 22.25 points.</p>
        <p>"I don't know if I'm an authority on comparing teams, because a lot of the great teams of the past, I'm not sure I could tell you how good they were," Cleveland Coach Mike Fratello said when asked where the Bulls rank. "I've seen them up close for a number of years, so I can attest to their greatness."</p>
        <p>Pippen said comparisons with previous eras may not be meaningful.</p>
        <p>"For anyone 20 years old or so, they can look at this team and say it's the best basketball team they've seen," he said. "I don't think you can look back to the '70s and compare teams. But in my time of having knowledge about basketball, I can say it's the best team ever."</p>
        <p>The Bulls settled this game early, taking control late in the first quarter when Jordan capped a 7-0 flurry with a 3-point shot that made it 21-13.</p>
        <p>Hornets 94, 76ers 78</p>
        <p>Charlotte moved into a tie with idle Miami for the eighth playoff spot in the East by pulling away from Philadelphia in the fourth quarter at the Spectrum.</p>
        <p>Glen Rice scored 19 points, Larry Johnson had 18, Kenny Anderson 14 and Dell  Curry had 10 points and a career-high 11 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Pistons 105, Celtics 96</p>
        <p>Grant Hill had 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, helping Detroit clinch  its first playoff spot since 1991-92 with an overtime victory over Boston in Auburn Hills, Mich. It was Hill's 10th triple-double of the season. Allan Houston added 27 points and a career-high 11 rebounds for Detroit.</p>
        <p>It was the Pistons' second victory over Boston in nine games.</p>
        <p>Kings 101, Clippers 96</p>
        <p>Mitch Richmond scored 26 of his 30 points in the second half as Sacramento maintained its hold on the final playoff spot in the Western Conference with the victory over visiting Los Angeles. Richmond, who averaged just 12 points over his previous three games, scored 4 points in the first half before getting  17 in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>The Kings stayed one and a half games ahead of Golden State, which defeated visiting Utah by 93-82, and two games ahead of Denver, which beat the Timberwolves in Minnesota, 98-91.</p>
