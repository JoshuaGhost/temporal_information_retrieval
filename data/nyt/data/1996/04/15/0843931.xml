        <p>A study by the New York Division of Criminal Justice Services has arrived at  provisional but nonetheless alarming conclusions about discrimination in the courts. The study finds that members of minority groups are substantially more likely than whites to be jailed -- even when they commit the same crimes and have similar criminal histories. The study warrants close examination by criminal justice officials and, ideally, a more detailed sequel.</p>
        <p>The study looked at people arrested for felonies and sentenced to either local jails or state prisons. There were significant but relatively small differences in prison sentences, perhaps because the state sets mandatory minimums for serious crimes. But startling differences appeared in local jail terms, which are always less than a year. A big segment of African-Americans and Latinos, some 30 percent in all, received harsher sentences than whites who had  committed comparable crimes. Researchers estimated that, throughout New York State, about 4,000 African-Americans and Latinos are sent to jail each year for  crimes and circumstances that do not lead to jail terms for whites.</p>

        <p>The study looked at people arrested for felonies and sentenced to either local jails or state prisons. There were significant but relatively small differences in prison sentences, perhaps because the state sets mandatory minimums for serious crimes. But startling differences appeared in local jail terms, which are always less than a year. A big segment of African-Americans and Latinos, some 30 percent in all, received harsher sentences than whites who had  committed comparable crimes. Researchers estimated that, throughout New York State, about 4,000 African-Americans and Latinos are sent to jail each year for  crimes and circumstances that do not lead to jail terms for whites.</p>
        <p>The state's Department of Criminal Justice says the study's methods were flawed. But researchers at the Sentencing Project, a Washington, research group, describe the study as one of the most important and sophisticated of its kind. Most sentencing studies involve gross head counts of inmates by race. The more refined New York study includes other factors, like gender, criminal history and type of arrest.</p>
        <p>The harsher treatment of minority defendants is especially meaningful because the courts have broad discretion in lesser felonies. People who commit some burglaries, assaults or lower-level drug offenses, for example, can either be sentenced to state or local jails or released. The study suggests that judges and police may more often award the lenient options to whites.</p>
        <p>Several areas need further study. What accounts for the disparities? What role do petty drug offenses play in the sentencing gap? What percentage of whites who do not receive jail terms are sentenced to community service or drug  treatment? Are these options readily available to minorities, and if not, why not? Rather than dismiss the study, the Pataki administration needs to follow it up.</p>
