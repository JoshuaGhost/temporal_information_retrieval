        <p>David Cone acted like an indomitable and indestructible toy placed inside a room with inferior and ineffective toys who quickly started looking for somewhere to hide. Wind Cone up, watch him march confidently to the mound and observe as he dominated the hitters.</p>
        <p>Obviously, Cone is more than a toy. Obviously, the Texas Rangers were not running away from him. But it sure looked that way after Cone toyed with the team that had won its first seven games of the season before losing on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Another powerful effort by Cone last night guided the Yankees to a 4-3 victory at Yankee Stadium in a game that became tense only after Cone had departed and John Wetteland had allowed a mammoth two-run homer to Dean Palmer in the ninth inning.</p>
        <p>Whether Cone was pumping 91-mile-per-hour fastballs on the inside corner, dropping down and firing his sidearm slider, fooling hitters with his split-finger pitch or floating slow curveballp, he was incredibly impressive. Cone treated Yankee Stadium like his own room and bounced out any Rangers who tried to play along and have some fun.</p>
        <p>"He was great," Manager Joe Torre said. "That's about as perfect as you can gep. He didn't really give them a whole lot. That was one heck of an outing."</p>
        <p>Cone shoved the Rangers to their second straight loss by striking out nine and yielding only four hits and no earned runs in seven innings. Continuing to look like a pitcher who might well be worth $19.5 million, Cone (2-0) has yielded one earned run in 21 innings (0.43 earned run average) this season.</p>
        <p>Wetteland picked up his first save by retiring three straight batters after the hdmer. "I'm sorry that I made it interesting," he said.</p>
        <p>Ruben Sierra also resembles a modern wind-up toy when he flashes his way around the bases after a home run, which is precisely what he did three hours after Torre said he disapproved of the trot. Sierra's scorching two-run homer off Ken Hill in the third inning disappeared over the right-field fence and keyed a three-run Yankee inning.</p>
        <p>Derek Jeter added a run-scoring triple to boost the score to 4-0 in the fourth and help the Yankees win their third straight, as well as begin avenging  last weekend's three losses to Texas.</p>
        <p>If Cone were a toy, he would have a special button to push for whenever teams have punners on base because that is when he is especially stingy.  After Juan Gonzalez singled Will Clark to third in the first inning, Cone struck out Mickey Tettleton on a 1-2 cut fastball for the first of three strikeouts. He also retired the next 10 Rangers who batted with runners on b'se. When the situation  became tighter, Cone got tougher.</p>
        <p>"It's difficult to be able to feature all four pitches," Cone said. "I felt like I could throw any pitch for a strike at any point. That's a good feeling. That's rare."</p>
        <p>Once Palmer ended his career 0-for-15 drought against Cone with a single in the seventh and advanced to third when Rusty Greer's liner glanced off first baseman Tino Martinez's glove for an error, Cone still almost preserved his shutout. He got Mark McLemore to pop out and narrowly missed an inning-ending double play when the pinch-hitter Warren Newson beat the return throw to first.  Cone retired Darryl Hamilton on a flyout and called it a night.</p>
        <p>Torre claimed in a radio interview Thursday that he would "carry" Sierra around the bases as long as he smashed homers. But the manager changed his mind  yesterday and said he did not like Sierra's flashy trot. He asked the slugger about it but said he would not try to change it.</p>
        <p>Sierra was a bit more subdued after drilling Hill's 2-0 fastball for his second homer in two games. He still shuffled toward the dugout and shook his fist, but he did not tug at his jersey. Maybe that is progress.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have made progress. Six days ago, Cone stood beside his locker at the Ballpark in Arlington after his seven stout innings were wasted when the bullpen folded in a 4-1 loss and claimed there was no nee' to panic. Apparently, he was right. He had his fun last night.</p>
        <p>"I'll take this every time," Cone said.</p>
