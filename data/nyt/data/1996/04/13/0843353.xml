        <p>The Loral Corporation said yesterday that it would spin off Loral Space and Communications Ltd. on the expiration date of the Lockheed Martin Corporation's  $9.1 billion offer to acquire most of Loral. Investors will get one share of Loral Space for every share of Loral they hold before April 22, the company said. The distribution of Loral Space shares is subject to the completed purchase by Lockheed Martin of two-thirds of Loral's 180 million outstanding shares for $38 a share. Lockheed Martin will also pay $344 million, or $7.50 a share, for a 20 percent stake in Loral Space, which will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange beginning April 20.</p>
