        <p>Former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, who had been considering running for the Presidency as an independent, has decided not to enter the race.</p>
        <p>Thomas D'Amore, a Weicker adviser, said on Thursday that the decision had been purely personal. "He indicated that he just didn't want to give up control of his life," said Mr. D'Amore, chairman of the Doyle Group, a political consulting firm in Hartford and Washington.</p>

        <p>Former Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, who had been considering running for the Presidency as an independent, has decided not to enter the race.</p>
        <p>Thomas D'Amore, a Weicker adviser, said on Thursday that the decision had been purely personal. "He indicated that he just didn't want to give up control of his life," said Mr. D'Amore, chairman of the Doyle Group, a political consulting firm in Hartford and Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weicker did not return a reporter's telephone call to his health-care consulting business in Bethesda, Md.</p>
        <p>A politician known for his brusque and independent style, Mr. Weicker had been consulting for months with family members, friends and advisers about entering the race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weicker is still interested in supporting an independent or third-party candidate for President, Mr. D'Amore said. He declined to comment on whether Mr. Weicker would support Ross Perot of Texas should Mr. Perot decide to run.</p>
        <p>A Republican-turned-independent, Mr. Weicker spent three terms in the Senate  until his defeat in 1988, when voters, annoyed with his maverick streak, abandoned him for Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a conservative Democrat.</p>
        <p>As a freshman on the Senate committee delving into the Watergate scandal, Mr. Weicker received national exposure as one of then President Nixon's fiercest critics.</p>
        <p>In 1990, Weicker shed his Republican Party label and formed A Connecticut Party, then won in a three-way race for governor.</p>
        <p>The hallmark of his four-year term was the enactment of the state's first-ever income tax. Mr. Weicker opted not to seek a second term.</p>
