        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your April 5 news article on forthcoming elections in India says that "socialist economic policies adopted in the Nehru-Gandhi era . . . had virtually bankrupted India by 1991." Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi, were confronted with a fait accompli created by two centuries of colonial domination. India's state of underdevelopment is a result of a purposeful act of victimization. Britain underdeveloped India.</p>
        <p>The article suggests that the happy alternative to the Nehru-Gandhi "socialist rigidities" is a turn to free-market economic policies. But it was under the flag of "free trade" that India was deindustrialized by Britain in the first place.</p>
        <p>In 1750, India produced almost 25 percent of the world's total manufactured goods. By 1914, India's share had dropped to 2 percent. In 1750, India's largest export was cotton textiles. By 1850, its largest export was opium, which Britain used to balance its trade with China.</p>
        <p>India's current misery stems from its having been forced at gunpoint into an  international economic system that was completely stacked against it from the beginning and still is today. Plunging ever deeper into that world market system will not solve its problems. Indeed, quick fixes of International Monetary Fund  loans and foreign investment can only deepen its chronic poverty, dependency and degradation.</p>
