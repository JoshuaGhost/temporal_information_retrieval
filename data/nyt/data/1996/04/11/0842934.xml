        <p>The Walt Disney Company and the McDonald's Corporation, two of the defining forces in American culture, are negotiating exclusive arrangements to cross-promote their products well into the next century, a Disney executive said today.</p>

        <p>The Walt Disney Company and the McDonald's Corporation, two of the defining forces in American culture, are negotiating exclusive arrangements to cross-promote their products well into the next century, a Disney executive said today.</p>
        <p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the executive confirmed a trade report today that the two companies were working on a 10-year deal that would allow McDonald's to run as many as 17 promotions a year linked to Disney films, characters and theme parks.</p>
        <p>McDonald's, which is based just west of here in Oak Brook, Ill., would also  sponsor Disney's new Florida theme park, Animal Kingdom, and pay $100 million in royalties to Disney, which is based in Burbank, Calif.</p>
        <p>"They are in active negotiations," said the executive, cautioning that the deal first reported in Daily Variety, the entertainment industry newspaper, had  not been completed. The major delay appears to be that not every Disney division has approved the deal. Since Disney's recent $19 billion acquisition of Capital  Cities/ABC, the company's operations span a wide variety of entertainment channels, as diverse as cable, network television, film, video and theme parks.</p>
        <p>Declining to confirm the negotiations, Charles Ebeling, a McDonald's spokesman, said, "This is all pure speculation."</p>
        <p>McDonald's willingness to pay big money to stretch its golden arches over Disney's products reflects its dismay at the huge successes its archrival, Burger King, has scored by linking itself to hit Disney films like "Toy Story,"  "The Lion King," "Aladdin" and "Beauty and the Beast."</p>
        <p>Because the new deal would be exclusive, it would also squeeze the Pizza Hut  and Taco Bell units of Pepsico Inc. out of their relationships with Disney.</p>
        <p>For all its scope, the Disney link would be just one of a wide range of promotional activities McDonald's is pursuing in its quest to remain king of the fast-food mountain. Just last month, for instance, McDonald's signed an agreement with Score Board, a company in Cherry Hill, N.J., to create and market prepaid telephone and trading cards with scenes from famous McDonald's advertisements.</p>
        <p>Still, toys connected with popular movies are the single biggest promotional  draw for family-oriented fast-food restaurants. McDonald's ordered 750 million toys last year, more than any toy company.</p>
        <p>At Burger King, a unit of Grand Metropolitan P.L.C., the sales of its Kids' Club meals doubled during the "Toy Story" promotion last year, an increase that  was all the more welcome because those young customers are usually accompanied by adults who purchase more expensive food for themselves.</p>
        <p>Estimates of how much money a fast-food company might sink into a single movie-based campaign go nearly as high as $100 million. From the film maker's perspective, the campaigns can greatly extend the benefits of the tens of millions of dollars routinely spent to promote movies.</p>
        <p>The Disney-McDonald's deal may have grown out of the fierce competition between McDonald's and Burger King for the right to cross-promote on Disney's forthcoming "Hercules." That contract has not yet been settled.</p>
        <p>In January, Disney reported a 2.9 percent rise in earnings for its first fiscal quarter, to $496 million, or 93 cents a share, a penny or two above analysts' forecasts. McDonald's most recent earnings report, for the fourth quarter of 1995, was released in January. The company had an 18.7 percent gain,  to $366.8 million, or 51 cents a share.</p>
        <p>The new alliance would revive a Disney-McDonald's relationship that largely soured during a 1990 dispute over promotions of the "Dick Tracy" movie.</p>
        <p>"Cross-promotion between established American brands is going to be a very, very important part of fueling their growth over the next decade," Christopher Dixon, a Paine Webber entertainment analyst, said of Disney, according to The Associated Press. He added that Disney "had a targeted growth rate of over 20 percent, and as the company gets larger and larger, it's very difficult to sustain those levels."</p>
        <p>Discussing the trend toward cross-promotions, Mr. Dixon said: "You get a happy meal at McDonald's, and all of a sudden you see the hunchback of Notre Dame grinning at you. It creates an enormous amount of brand awareness, and that means that consumers say, 'Gee, Mom, let's go to see the hunchback.' "</p>
