        <p>HOLDERS of utility stocks, already skittish from cuts in dividends and drives to make electricity pricing more competitive, can now begin to worry about what  the industry calls stranded costs.</p>
        <p>Stranded costs are generally the cost overruns on nuclear plants built in the last two decades. So far, most utilities have have been paying them off gradually. But pressure to pay them off more rapidly has grown as many states have begun planning to open their closed utility markets to outside competition. By paying off the overruns faster, some utility companies would be better able to face rate competition in the future because the costs would no longer figure  in their pricing.</p>

        <p>HOLDERS of utility stocks, already skittish from cuts in dividends and drives to make electricity pricing more competitive, can now begin to worry about what  the industry calls stranded costs.</p>
        <p>Stranded costs are generally the cost overruns on nuclear plants built in the last two decades. So far, most utilities have have been paying them off gradually. But pressure to pay them off more rapidly has grown as many states have begun planning to open their closed utility markets to outside competition. By paying off the overruns faster, some utility companies would be better able to face rate competition in the future because the costs would no longer figure  in their pricing.</p>
        <p>Pacific Gas and Electric, the nation's largest utility, has become the first to decide to take this course at such a fast pace.</p>
        <p>Faced with a drive in California that would allow some customers to begin choosing to buy their electricity for less from other power providers, Pacific Gas and Electric has proposed to try to get its nuclear financial nightmare behind it quickly.</p>
        <p>It has proposed to the California Public Utilities Commission to pay off the  remaining cost overruns of its Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant in five years rather than 20 years.</p>
        <p>The catch is that to do so it will have to pay an additional $700 million a year, a move that will cut its earnings and may force it to reduce its high dividend payment of $1.96 a share.</p>
        <p>It will also mean that the utility's customers will have to settle for having their rates frozen until 2001 instead of seeing them go down because of greater  competition. But the alternative for the company is to close its Diablo Canyon nuclear plant because it cannot produce electricity cheaply enough to be competitive when customers are able to buy electricity from less costly producers.</p>
        <p>No date has been set by the commission to review the P.G.&amp;E. proposal, but shareholders have not waited for a hearing to voice their dismay.</p>
        <p>The utility's stock, which had already been in a decline, plunged $2.125 March 29, the day the proposal was announced, to $22.375, or 10 percent -- a huge drop for a utility stock, which is supposed to be a more stable investment. Yesterday, the stock closed at $22.50, off 37.5 cents.</p>
        <p>And there is more uncertainty ahead. There is doubt whether the utility can continue to pay its dividend if its earnings drop to about $2.05 a share, compared with the original projection of $2.75 a share for next year, said Dan F. Ford, the utility analyst for Merrill Lynch.</p>
        <p>Barry Abramson, a utility analyst for Prudential Securities, said that other  utilities might decide to speed up the process of paying off the cost overruns for nuclear plants that will have a difficult time competing after deregulation. He said they included Northeast Utilities, the Public Service Enterprise Group of New Jersey, PECO Energy of Philadelphia, Ohio Edison, Centerior Energy of Cleveland and Unicom of Chicago .</p>
        <p>Mr. Abramson said that the proposal by Pacific Gas and Electric "is the best  strategic move to protect themselves." However, he added, "it's not necessarily  the best for the stockholders." Such trade-offs, he said, are going to become more common.</p>
        <p>For all its early problems, the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant, which is near the coast halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles, has become one of the best-run nuclear plants in the country, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The plant, built in the 1980's, was supposed to cost $350 million but after long delays and mistakes ended up costing $5.8 billion.</p>
        <p>But in the changing world of the utility industry the plant, despite its good operating record, could end up a fossil unless the company's strategy is successful.</p>
