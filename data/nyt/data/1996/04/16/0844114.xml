        <p>Even as the Giants' draft microscope focuses on the Illinois linebacker Simeon Rice, the team continues to take care of other business by signing its own free agents. The Giants have come to terms with defensive end Stacey Dillard and linebacker Marcus Buckley.</p>
        <p>Dillard has agreed to a two-year deal for $1.25 million. The Giants did not announce his agreement, but are expected to do so in a few days. The Giants announced signing Buckley for two years, but not the terms.</p>

        <p>Even as the Giants' draft microscope focuses on the Illinois linebacker Simeon Rice, the team continues to take care of other business by signing its own free agents. The Giants have come to terms with defensive end Stacey Dillard and linebacker Marcus Buckley.</p>
        <p>Dillard has agreed to a two-year deal for $1.25 million. The Giants did not announce his agreement, but are expected to do so in a few days. The Giants announced signing Buckley for two years, but not the terms.</p>
        <p>Dillard is a solid and consistent player who is an excellent run stopper and good team player. He played in 15 games, with three starts, last season and finished with 33 tackles and one sack. As inconsistent as the defensive line has been at times, with the exception of end Mike Strahan, it is good news for the Giants that they held onto a consistent player.</p>
        <p>Buckley has talent, but has been played mostly out of position at strong side linebacker, where he takes on the tight end, instead of the weak side, where he  would mostly pass rush. He replaced Corey Miller as the starter, but was eventually replaced by Miller toward the end of the season. Buckley finished with 20 tackles, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery.</p>
        <p>The Giants, with the No. 5 pick over all in the draft on Saturday, are concentrating on Rice. He has been described by scouts as a player who could be  another Charles Haley if he works hard and becomes more motivated. The 6-foot-5-inch, 259-pound Rice was dominating at times in college, and although he is listed as a linebacker, he is really a pass rushing defensive end.</p>
        <p>But if the U.C.L.A. left tackle Jon Ogden slips down to the Giants, they will think long and hard about taking him. Also, if rumors are true -- and around draft time teams change their minds when the wind blows -- and Jacksonville backs off the Illinois linebacker Kevin Hardy, he could slip to the fifth pick.  If he did, the Giants would snap him up in a heartbeat. But neither Ogden nor Hardy will probably slide that far, which is why the Giants have centered their  attention on Rice.</p>
