        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Pretending to Be Poor" (editorial, April 14) does not explain why many middle-class elderly are using Medicaid to pay for nursing home care. The average cost of nursing home care is $35,000 a year, with many middle-class families losing their lifetime savings after just two years of a spouse's nursing home stay.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>"Pretending to Be Poor" (editorial, April 14) does not explain why many middle-class elderly are using Medicaid to pay for nursing home care. The average cost of nursing home care is $35,000 a year, with many middle-class families losing their lifetime savings after just two years of a spouse's nursing home stay.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, Congress enacted provisions to allow elderly spouses to protect small parts of their assets and homes so they would not become impoverished when their mates were placed in nursing homes. Proposals to penalize spouses who refuse to support their mates in nursing homes could push thousands into poverty and not substantially reduce the cost to government.</p>
        <p>The nation needs to consider all options for financing long-term care services. The insurance option you mention, costing $2,500 a year in New York City, is not an option for elderly living on small fixed incomes. However, other steps, like lowering the estate tax exemption from $600,000, would furnish funds for services to the elderly without forcing anyone into poverty.</p>
