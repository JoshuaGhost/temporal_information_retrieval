        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is ironic that John Allen Paulos, who has written on misuse of numbers, should base his musings about mathematics and "Luddites" (Op-Ed, April 7) on one among thousands of Ph.D's.: Theodore J. Kaczynski, who left mathematics 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>The Unabomber's manifesto, he says, has the signature of a mathematical paper. Mathematicians are "radical" thinkers in that they get to the root of the matter, he says, and "it is easy to see how one trained in such reasoning and in thrall to an ideal could come to justify murderous acts as a nebulous 'good.' "</p>
        <p>On what evidence does Mr. Paulos base his absurd analogy between the thinking of a mathematician -- as compared, say, with that of a philosopher -- and a bomber?</p>
        <p>Mathematicians, in applying mathematics, make contributions to society. In that sense, its ideals are the antithesis of those embraced by the Unabomber. It is not that the suspect was a mathematician that is relevant, but rather that he turned his back on mathematics before apparently embarking on a criminal career.</p>
        <p>JOSEPH LIPMAN STEVEN H. WEINTRAUB West Lafayette, Ind., April 9, 1996</p>
        <p>The writers are professors of mathematics at, respectively, Purdue University and Louisiana State U.</p>
