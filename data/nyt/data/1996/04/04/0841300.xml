        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re "Imperial Russia" (editorial, March 31), on serious talk in Moscow of reconstituting the Soviet Union or some variation of it, and the widespread view that Moscow must do something to protect the interests of "30 million ethnic Russians who remained behind in the former Soviet republics when the union collapsed in 1991":</p>
        <p>Your numerical reference represents an exaggeration of what was an inaccuracy in the first place. The more oft-cited figure of 25 million ethnic Russians finds its origin in the Soviet census of 1989, conducted by a Government that spent decades directing a campaign of Russification of the many  non-Russian nations it controlled. Many "ethnic Russians" are merely Russian-speakers.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the "25 million" figure is embraced by the Russian Government, as it serves to legitimize interference in the independent countries around its periphery.</p>
        <p>In Ukraine, that Russian-minority trump card has been ineffective as Russian-speakers enjoy state-sponsored Russian-language schools, television, printed press and official documentation. Virtually none of the ethnic Russians  in Ukraine have availed themselves of the opportunity to obtain Russian citizenship.</p>
        <p>In addition, polls find that despite this year's acute economic hardship, there has been no change in how Ukraine's major ethnic groups view their situation vis-a-vis their rights as distinct nationalities: Ukraine's Russian community feels at home along with their fellow Ukrainian citizens.</p>
        <p>Of those 25 million ethnic Russians, 11 million are residents of Ukraine. The vast majority are Russified Ukrainians who have forgotten their mother tongue (or prefer to communicate in Russian) but whose livelihood and family heritage are tied to Ukraine, most for centuries.</p>
        <p>Ukraine's first census, devoid of the ethnic manipulation that plagued Soviet policy, should go far in shooing away a significant number of those 25 million or 30 million paper tigers.</p>
