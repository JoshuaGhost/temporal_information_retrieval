        <p>Siebe P.L.C. offered yesterday to buy the 75 percent of Unitech P.L.C. that it did not own for L520 million ($796 million) in a move that would help its growth in Asia. Unitech's board agreed to back the offer. Siebe bought 25 percent of Unitech in mid-March. The new purchase would make Siebe the world's biggest manufacturer of power-supply converters, which are used in electronic equipment, with 6 percent of the market.</p>
