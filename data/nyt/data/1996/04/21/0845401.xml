        <p>It is one of a handful of businesses on West 72d Street that have not had a makeover in decades. But not even Eclair, the "Russian Tea Room of the Upper West Side," is immune to change.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1939, the flagship bakery and restaurant of the Eclair chain has long been a gathering place for refugees from Europe, offering a reminder of Vienna in the 30's. But that clientele has steadily dwindled, and Alan Sloan, who bought Eclair from its founder, Alexander Selinger, three years ago, is planning to remodel the restaurant for Manhattan in the 90's.</p>
        <p>The move is antagonizing some of Eclair's regulars, and it may put the restaurant, which is between Broadway and Columbus Avenue, at odds with the neighborhood's landmark preservationists. Concerned about how to satisfy one generation without alienating another, Mr. Sloan has set up a suggestion box. "The old people unanimously say stay the same," he said. "The young people say get a cappuccino maker and some jazz."</p>
        <p>"The concept of the renovation is a lot of wood and glass, a lot of wicker and glass," Mr. Sloan added, saying this was in keeping with Eclair's three other bakery-cafes in Manhattan and one to open soon on Fulton Street in Brooklyn. He also talked about painting the red flocked walls creamy white and changing the ornate, angular glass light fixtures.</p>
        <p>He says he has not decided on specific changes to the facade; such changes could incur preservationists' wrath. "If he realizes he has a nice, unique thing on his hands," said Francoise Bollack of Landmark West, a preservation group, "if he just restored it and spruced it up he would have something wonderful.People get worked up and say it's dirty and rundown, we should tear it down. It's sort of in the spirit of 'the ashtrays are full, we have to move.' "</p>
        <p>Lisa Schwarz, director of Aufbau, a 62-year-old German-language newspaper on  the Upper West Side, remembers Eclair's glory days. "It used to be fabulous," she said. "For all the European actors and artists, it was the place to meet." Ms. Schwartz said the paper was currently in litigation with the restaurant over payment for advertising.</p>
        <p>Some regulars have stopped coming for good. "The very old ones have died," said Hilde Massari, a waitress for 11 years. "Not a little, a lot of them." But  a handful still order a hot lunch each weekday. One woman wouldn't reveal her name but said she had been coming for 50 years and calls the Eclair her second home. "I got used to this place," she said in heavily accented English. "It is always friendly and welcoming."</p>
        <p>At a nearby table, Valerie Walls, a regular for 25 years, downed a meal of meat and potatoes. "It's not one of those run-of-the-mill hamburger places," she said with delight. "If they would leave it just the way it is, that would be fine."</p>
