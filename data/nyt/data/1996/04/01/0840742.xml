        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I recognize the lack of understanding of historical background among Roman Catholic clergy and lay members in Nebraska, where Bishop Fabian W. Bruskewitz threatens to excommunicate members of groups who disagree with church doctrine (news article, March 26).</p>
        <p>An example from the mid-19th century might help. At that time in Quebec, Bishop Ignace Bourget of Montreal placed under interdict the Institut Canadien, which included in its library some liberal books that were on the index of prohibited books.</p>
        <p>In 1869, Joseph Guibord, a member of the institute, was denied burial in consecrated ground, causing a religious and legal conflict that lasted five years. After the highest court ruled that he deserved burial in the Catholic cemetery, armed escorts enforced the ruling. Then the Bishop de-consecrated the  burial place. In 19th-century terms, he had the last word after reams of publicity that worsened religious tensions of that day.  Does a church official  today want the publicity that comes with comparable action?</p>
