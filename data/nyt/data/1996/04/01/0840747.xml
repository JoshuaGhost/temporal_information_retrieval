        <p>A year ago this department erred slightly when it credited Steve Stanton of Stuart, Fla., with the honor of being the oldest male club director in North America. He is 88, and must give pride of place to Al Perkins of the Bay Ridge Club in Brooklyn, which gathers at 12:30 P.M. each Wednesday at the Church of the Good Shepherd, 74th Street and Fourth Avenue. He has been directing there for 19 years, and on Wednesday, his players honored him on his 90th birthday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perkins came to this country 70 years ago from Barbados. He is an old-fashioned, courtly man who runs an old-fashioned, low-key game, different in two respects from most other clubs: the director is little troubled by contentious players during the game -- he was not summoned once on Wednesday to  give a ruling at any of the 14 tables -- but works harder when it is over. Having no truck with modern electronics, he takes the score slips home and wrestles happily with the challenge of manual match-pointing.</p>

        <p>A year ago this department erred slightly when it credited Steve Stanton of Stuart, Fla., with the honor of being the oldest male club director in North America. He is 88, and must give pride of place to Al Perkins of the Bay Ridge Club in Brooklyn, which gathers at 12:30 P.M. each Wednesday at the Church of the Good Shepherd, 74th Street and Fourth Avenue. He has been directing there for 19 years, and on Wednesday, his players honored him on his 90th birthday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perkins came to this country 70 years ago from Barbados. He is an old-fashioned, courtly man who runs an old-fashioned, low-key game, different in two respects from most other clubs: the director is little troubled by contentious players during the game -- he was not summoned once on Wednesday to  give a ruling at any of the 14 tables -- but works harder when it is over. Having no truck with modern electronics, he takes the score slips home and wrestles happily with the challenge of manual match-pointing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perkins played on Wednesday, and his first deal, as East in the diagram, proved challenging. South, pushed to five spades, won the club lead with the ace, ruffed a club, and led a trump. If he had finessed, he could have emerged with an overtrick, but he played the ace in the hope of dropping a singleton king. When this failed, he led the heart ten, a slight error, and finessed the queen when West covered with the jack. He then surrendered a spade to East, leaving this position:</p>
        <p>NORTH</p>
        <p>8</p>
        <p>A 7 4</p>
        <p>K 6 4 3</p>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>WEST</p>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>K 9 6</p>
        <p>A J 10 7</p>
        <p>K</p>
        <p>EAST</p>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>5 3</p>
        <p>Q</p>
        <p>10 9 6 4 3</p>
        <p>SOUTH</p>
        <p>Q J 10 6</p>
        <p>8</p>
        <p>9 8 2</p>
        <p>--</p>
        <p>East returned his diamond queen, and West, helpless, took the ace and played  the jack. The declarer, Leonard Irish, took the king and ran his trumps to squeeze West and make his game.</p>
        <p>Ducking the diamond queen to force the king would not have saved West, for the run of the trumps would have squeezed him in a more subtle fashion. Mr. Perkins had the last word on the contract: "I should have returned a heart and beaten it," he pointed out, quite correctly. Removing dummy's heart ace would have cut off a vital entry.</p>
