        <p>The General Motors Corporation is exploring the possibility of spinning off part of its Hughes Electronics Corporation, an article in The Detroit Free Press said on Saturday. G.M. declined to comment on the report today.</p>
        <p>The article said G.M. was considering the creation of a separate stock for the rapidly growing Hughes satellite and communications business, which includes the DirecTV satellite television service.</p>
        <p>Analysts told the newspaper that G.M. was expected to discuss the issue in a document scheduled to be filed on Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
        <p>"It's our policy not to comment on such speculation," a G.M. spokesman, Mark  Tanner, said.</p>
        <p>Under the current structure, G.M. owns a majority of class H shares, which reflect the financial performance of Hughes Electronics. On Friday, the stock jumped $1.875 to close at a 52-week high of $63.25 while G.M.'s shares lost 87.5 cents, to $53.25.</p>
        <p>Under one possible plan, G.M. would buy all the class H stock outstanding and spin off 20 percent of the new company in a public offering.</p>
        <p>David Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities Inc., said it was not likely that G.M. would spin off Hughes entirely. "The only thing G.M. has said today is they like Hughes very much and want to keep it," he said.</p>
