        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The bigotry New York City Councilwoman Julia Harrison displayed when analyzing Asian immigration to Queens is not surprising, but her hypocrisy is (front page, March 31).</p>
        <p>According to Mrs. Harrison, her grandfather had the right to come here because he was fleeing persecution in a foreign land, but today's Asian immigrants are only here to make money and break the law.</p>
        <p>Obviously, Mrs. Harrison is not aware of the massive human rights violations  occurring in Asian countries, most prominently in China. Immigrants come here because the United States offers things that they cannot have in their home countries, such as freedom.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Harrison also forgets that her own immigrant population of Jewish Europeans settled here speaking languages the old-timers couldn't understand and selling foods they had never tasted. Moreover, such Jewish immigrants as Meyer Lansky became criminals, yet I would hope outsiders would not brand all Jewish immigrants as criminals, as Mrs. Harrison has done with the Asian population.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Harrison's remarks are repugnant and misinformed. I hope that like the racists of 100 years ago, she will lose her fight to keep immigrants out.</p>
