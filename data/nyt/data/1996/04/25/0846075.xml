        <p>Just days after welcoming leaders from major industrial nations to Moscow, President Boris N.

        <p>Just days after welcoming leaders from major industrial nations to Moscow, President Boris N. Yeltsin arrived in Beijing today for three days of high-profile meetings that both he and President Jiang Zemin of China appear to  view as a chance to play to important constituencies at home.</p>
        <p>With the Russian presidential election less than two months away, Mr. Yeltsin has sought opportunities to demonstrate his stature as a statesman and display his vigor, no small concern for a 65-year-old candidate with a heart ailment.</p>
        <p>For the Chinese President, the visit is a face-enhancing sign of his international standing, helpful in the subtle succession politics as China awaits the death of Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader.</p>
        <p>Top aides accompanying Mr. Yeltsin said he planned to sign several agreements, from the sale of a new reactor to a border agreement. But some of the economic accords fall short of contractual commitments and others have been  in the works for some time.</p>
        <p>The potential electoral payoff for Mr. Yeltsin is a matter of pride and imagery. While Russian voters are not preoccupied with foreign policy, nationalism and a sense that Russia has been taken advantage of by the West have become important themes. The visit provides Mr. Yeltsin with an opportunity to demonstrate that Moscow is not unduly beholden to the West.</p>
        <p>It is part of a busy schedule of foreign activities for Mr. Yeltsin that have been dutifully, even extravagantly reported by Russian television and include a trip to Norway and the signing of mostly symbolic "integration" agreements with the former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan.</p>
        <p>These agreements were intended to outflank the Communists, Mr. Yeltsin's chief opponent in the election, who have called for the restoration of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>Casting himself as a defender of Russian interests, Mr. Yeltsin has also argued successfully for Russia's inclusion in the Council of Europe, and he has  castigated NATO for its plan to accept new East European members.</p>
        <p>Russia also has policy reasons for a China visit. The earlier hope of Russian reformers to build ties with Japan has been hampered by territorial disputes.</p>
        <p>"There has been a clear shift to mainland Asia in the last two or three years," said Andrei V. Kortunov, a foreign policy analyst. "China is Number 1 in terms of Russian policy in Asia."</p>
        <p>There are also trade issues. Cheap Chinese goods are common in Russia, and Russia has found in China a fertile market for military equipment, most recently SU-27 fighter planes.</p>
        <p>Viktor Mikhailov, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy, said that the two sides planned to sign a "framework" agreement covering Russia's sale of a new nuclear  power plant in the northeastern Liaoning province. But he said the final price of the plant, which has been under discussion for years, was not yet agreed.</p>

        <p>Action on Nuclear Ban</p>
        <p>BEIJING, Thursday, April 25 (Reuters) -- President Jiang Zemin said today that China backed a nuclear test ban treaty by the end of this year, President Yeltsin told reporters after talks with Mr. Jiang.</p>
        <p>China has said it is ready to sign a test ban treaty with the four other nuclear powers, but only at the end of 1996. China is believed to have plans for at least two tests this year.</p>
