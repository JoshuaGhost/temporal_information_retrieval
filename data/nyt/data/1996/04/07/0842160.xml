        <p>THE 1990's have proven a grim time for foreign aid as we know it -- the grants and loans that are the traditional form of international development assistance. Everywhere these days, it seems, support for such aid is dwindling,  and once-generous donors are focusing their energies inward.</p>
        <p>It hasn't helped, of course, that three decades of foreign development assistance in the third world has failed to lift the poorest of the poor in Africa and Asia much beyond where they have always been.</p>
        <p>Alarmed by the downward spiral of their budgets, and chastened by the lack of results, many of the world's leading aid agencies have begun the most serious rethinking of their efforts since the boom days of the development aid business  began in the 1960's.</p>
        <p>Two New Approaches</p>
        <p>Most dramatically, they are beginning to suggest something that once was heard only from outright enemies of foreign aid: that big cash outlays to central governments may only pave the way to corruption.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for this shift is competition from another approach to development altogether. The United States has moved far from the original notion of shipping money to governments (in competition with Moscow) so they could finance showpiece projects. For a decade and a half now, budget-conscious officials in Washington have been putting far more emphasis on revising trade rules and promoting direct investmant by American companies.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, direct grants and loans are coming from other countries, such as Japan and Germany, or from pooled sources like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (often with strings attached). And in those quarters, illusions of quickly transforming an entire country's economy from the top down  through aid have faded.</p>
        <p>At the same time, a tendency to lend money for big projects -- visible things like bridges and dams, which often prove ruinous even though they mean fat supply contracts for companies in the donor countries -- is giving way to a new  emphasis on projects to improve the welfare of ordinary people.</p>
        <p>In the future, lenders see themselves spending more on skill-building projects, like professional training programs and basic education. The World Bank and its wing, the International Finance Corporation, for example, are lending money and training people to create local credit unions and small businesses.</p>
        <p>One of the most frequently heard buzzwords in this emerging discussion is "capacity building." The underlying philosophy is that development has been held back in the world's poorest countries by a lack of qualified local officials and entrepreneurs. Implicit in this change, too, is the idea that working through central governments is a recipe for waste.</p>
        <p>Many donors say they want to encourage decentralization and reinforce democratic practices, to which most lenders have paid only lip service in the past.</p>
        <p>"For too long development cooperation has focused on the economy and not on the polity," said James Gustave Speth, administrator of the United Nations Development Program, which has just launched a $25 billion development program for Africa that is is driven by a "capacity-building" ethic. "Without a functioning political system and effective governance, the best-laid economic plans are not going to succeed."</p>
        <p>Fattening the Elites</p>
        <p>Many critics of international development assistance are far from certain that this shift will make aid "work" in the future. But what is certain, they say, is that the approaches of the past have mostly failed.</p>
        <p>In a research paper published last fall, Peter Boone, a professor at the London School of Economics, concluded that development assistance had fattened political elites and spawned a thriving global community of non-governmental organizations, but had done little to improve living standards in poor countries. "In terms of human development, I looked at things like primary school enrollment, infant mortality and life expectancy in 97 countries between  1970 and 1990, and there was no correlation between these sorts of indicators and development assistance," Mr. Boone said.</p>
        <p>The study also compared French-speaking West Africa with its English-speaking neighbors. Although the Francophone countries have consistently enjoyed higher levels of foreign support, Mr. Boone's study indicates that they have little to  show for it.</p>
        <p>What most separates countries that lift living standards of the poor and those that don't, Mr. Boone concludes, is not the amount of funds, but rather the dedication of third-world governments to resolving basic quality of life issues. "If you look at Chile, they reduced infant mortality by 70 percent because they decided they were going to make that their priority," Mr. Boone said. "A leftist government in Kerala state in India did the same thing."</p>
        <p>A Source of Anger</p>
        <p>In the developing world, calls to bypass central governments and impose closer scrutiny on the use of aid funds have already brought one unexpected type of response: anger at the perceived cynicism in how the West has used development monies in the past for the good of companies and privately-run groups known as non-governmental organizations (like the Red Cross or Church World Services) back home.</p>
        <p>"Experience in many places suggests that there are many who are jumping on the N.G.O. bandwagon for reasons that have nothing to do with development as such," said Kwesi Botchway, a former Ghanaian minister of finance who spoke at a major international conference on development in Maastricht, Holland in November. "Some promote narrow sectarian interests even as they purport to advance popular aspirations. Some see N.G.O.'s as plain business."</p>
        <p>Other advocates of profound reforms in foreign aid see a self-interested West as the root of many past failures as well. "A lot of the aid given in the 70's and 80's was fueled by cold war competition or by the ambitions of the French,"  said Mats Karlssen, Sweden's Under Secretary of State. "If you really wanted to  make an impact on things like child mortality or illiteracy, I could have told you from the beginning that that kind of aid would not have any impact." He also said donors shouldn't continually impose their own thinking about development, and instead need "stronger policies from the borrowers themselves."</p>
        <p>Where these two schools of thought come together is in the need for foreign donors to give greater encouragement to countries where real democratization is  taking place -- places. Mr. Boone said, where "the poor are more empowered," and where "this induces governments to provide more basic services."</p>
