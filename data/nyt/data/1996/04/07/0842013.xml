        <p>TOGETHER WE WERE ELEVEN FOOT NINE The Twenty-Year Friendship of Hall of Fame Pitcher Jim Palmer and Orioles Manager Earl Weaver. By Jim Palmer and Jim Dale. Andrews &amp; McMeel, $21.95.</p>
        <p>The pitcher Jim Palmer signed with the Baltimore Orioles in 1965 and remained with them, through numerous injuries, threats and disputes, until his retirement in 1984. He won 245 of his 268 major league victories and three Cy Young Awards, and claimed all eight of his 20-win seasons, under the feisty, pugnacious Orioles manager Earl Weaver, who like Mr. Palmer ended up in the Hall of Fame. Throughout, as Mr. Palmer recounts in "Together We Were Eleven Foot Nine" (written with Jim Dale, a former advertising executive), player and manager cultivated an intense, highly publicized love-hate relationship based on their shared obsession with winning. It's difficult to think of an odder professional  couple: Mr. Palmer, tall and handsome, became famous to non-baseball fans as the sexy but clean-cut model for Jockey underwear; Mr. Weaver was short and stocky,  and his dugout language was so salty that it's almost impossible to find a quotation anywhere in the book suitable for reprinting here. The outward conflicts, however, belied a deep mutual respect that allowed the two men to squabble constantly, yet still go on and win the next game. Mr. Palmer's ironic, self-mocking style makes this book a winner.</p>
