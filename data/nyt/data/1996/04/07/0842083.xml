        <p>A heroin addict faces constant peril. Not only are half of New York's 200,000 intravenous drug users H.I.V.-positive, but addicts also run the risk of buying  tainted heroin that can lead to overdose or death.</p>
        <p>While there's no such thing as a consumer protection agency for drug users, the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center has begun a modest campaign to keep tabs on the heroin that has made its clients sick. On the wall of its needle exchange storefront at 39 Avenue C hangs a chalkboard that lists street brand names like "Nynex," "La Bomba" and "Satan" and a warning that they may be dangerous.</p>
        <p>We've become an information clearinghouse," said Mark Gerse, director of the needle exchange program. "If we didn't get the word out, it would take a series of deaths to get people's attention." Mr. Gerse said the number of suspect brands had at least tripled in the last month, all reported by clients who had bad experiences.</p>
        <p>Many of the 700 people who go to the center each week to exchange syringes check the board. Some addicts are actually drawn to potentially deadly mixes, which they dilute to attain a stronger high than from untainted heroin. But most, said Mr. Gerse, heed the warnings. The number of overdoses has plummeted since the bulletin board went up.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, 12 people died in Manhattan after injecting a lethal batch of  heroin sold under the name China Cat. One addict, who has been mainlining for more than a decade, said he had had many close calls with toxic heroin. "It's good to know that there's someone actually looking after us," he said. "Because truth is, nobody else cares if we kill ourselves with bad dope."</p>
