        <p>Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has urged that school principals be stripped of  their tenured job security and that local school boards lose their power to hire and fire. Both reforms are vital to the improvement of New York City's schools.  Principals are the crucial force in determining whether a school succeeds or fails. Those who perform poorly must be ousted, not held in place by an outmoded tenure system. School boards, meanwhile, have too often used their hiring powers for patronage and, in some cases, graft. They must be reined in and refocused on education issues. Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders need to work hard to make both reforms happen.</p>
        <p>The 32 local school boards were created in the 1960's to give communities greater influence over education. But the local boards control hundreds of jobs, from principals to teaching aides, in each district. The arrangement invites favoritism in hiring. Investigations in some districts have shown that teachers  and principals are routinely approached for political contributions and kickbacks.</p>

        <p>Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has urged that school principals be stripped of  their tenured job security and that local school boards lose their power to hire and fire. Both reforms are vital to the improvement of New York City's schools.  Principals are the crucial force in determining whether a school succeeds or fails. Those who perform poorly must be ousted, not held in place by an outmoded tenure system. School boards, meanwhile, have too often used their hiring powers for patronage and, in some cases, graft. They must be reined in and refocused on education issues. Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders need to work hard to make both reforms happen.</p>
        <p>The 32 local school boards were created in the 1960's to give communities greater influence over education. But the local boards control hundreds of jobs, from principals to teaching aides, in each district. The arrangement invites favoritism in hiring. Investigations in some districts have shown that teachers  and principals are routinely approached for political contributions and kickbacks.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature granted principals tenure early in this century to prevent them from being dismissed for expressing unpopular views. But whatever value such protections may have, tenure is now interfering with good management. Principals are first and foremost managers, who run large staffs and carry out education policy. Their union has repeatedly used both tenure and union status to avoid responsibilities inherent to the job and accountability for a school's  performance.</p>
        <p>The case of the school custodians is a prime example. The custodians go largely unsupervised and control enormous budgets. Some have used their position for personal gain. Yet many principals have resisted accepting responsibility for the custodians, for fear of being reclassified as management.</p>
        <p>Speaking before a forum of business leaders last Friday, Chancellor Crew condemned this approach, saying it was time to "reinvent the New York City public schools so that they are performance-driven." To do that, he said, we must hold both principals and local school boards to higher levels of accountability. Dr. Crew's proposal has yet to be spelled out. But he is thinking of replacing tenure for principals with three- or four-year contracts that spell out specific criteria for rehiring. The criteria might include student achievement and the principal's leadership skills, ability to manage resources wisely, and success in involving parents and the community. The Chancellor would also remove local school boards' hiring power, giving it to district superintendents.</p>
        <p>The State Legislature is ambivalent about Dr. Crew's proposals. Several legislators have offered blueprints that would either abolish or cut the power of local boards. Though the proposals vary, most agree on one key point -- local boards need to concentrate on community service and broad policy aims.</p>
        <p>Like many of his peers, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver is against abolishing tenure. The Speaker has instead offered a halfway proposal that allows the chancellor to remove principals whose schools are academic failures. Many in the Legislature argue that, in a system as political as this one, tenure is needed to protect principals from vendettas. The answer to that is to get politics out  of the system altogether, and evaluate officials at every level on the basis of  professional performance.</p>
