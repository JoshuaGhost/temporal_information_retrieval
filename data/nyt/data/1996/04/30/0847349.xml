        <p>A pipe bomb packed with three-inch nails exploded in a doorway of Spokane City Hall before dawn this morning, the police said. The building was unoccupied, and no one was injured.</p>
        <p>Residents of nearby apartments reported hearing a boom about 3 A.M., and workers discovered damaged doors about 6:30 A.M., Chief Terry Mangan of the Spokane police said. Shrapnel in the area appeared to be from "a fairly large pipe bomb," he said.</p>
        <p>The building's heavy oak doors apparently deflected the blast away from the  building, and nails ended up more than a block away in Riverfront Park, Chief Mangan said.</p>
        <p>"If this had been a crowded day, if we had had a lot of people out here, we would have had very, very serious and very, very many injuries," he said.</p>
        <p>No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, but Chief Mangan said the police were investigating some graffiti on the building.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month there were bombings at a newspaper office and a bank in the Spokane area.</p>
        <p>A bomb squad searched City Hall for other explosives today while people who work there were sent to wait at the Spokane Arena about three blocks away.</p>
        <p>The Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were called in, and the authorities searched other municipal buildings, bridges and communication sites as a precaution. No other devices were found, Chief Mangan said.</p>
        <p>On April 1, men in ski masks and fatigues set off a small bomb while robbing  a bank in suburban Spokane Valley. Minutes earlier, another pipe bomb had exploded outside a nearby office of The Spokesman-Review.</p>
