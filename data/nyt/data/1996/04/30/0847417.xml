        <p>"They're home," Dean Katz, a Microsoft spokesman, said yesterday. "Everybody's fine."</p>
        <p>It's the first child for the couple, who were married in 1994. Mr. Gates, 40, is reported to be worth an estimated $14.8 billion. But he has said that he  doesn't want his children to be raised with enormous wealth and has announced his intention to give away 95 percent of his money rather than pass it on to his heirs.</p>
