        <p>Down on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, a lot of high-priced talent is just standing around in the frenzy. Henry B. Schacht, the chairman of Lucent  Technologies, is part of the crowd, and so are Richard A. Grasso, the exchange chairman, and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of Italy, who is at the exchange to give a speech. Messengers push through the gawkers to deliver buy or sell orders to Michael La Branche, the specialist at Post 7-N.</p>
        <p>Lucent is going public, a spinoff of AT&amp;T. And even those who are not trying  to buy shares in the $3 billion deal, the largest initial public offering in American history, want to witness it.</p>
        <p>Most excited of all, perhaps, is Nellie Perkins, who works the second shift  at a Lucent plant in Oklahoma City. She has never before set foot in New York City, let alone on the floor of the Big Board, but on this particular day, April 4, Lucent has flown her in to buy the first 500 shares.</p>
        <p>Finally, at 10:44 A.M., 74 minutes after the opening bell, Mr. La Branche matches orders and bundles them into one trade. Ms. Perkins, whose purchase is part of the package, announces the inaugural transaction: "15,887,800 Lucent shares to trade at 31 7/8." Cameras click. There are smiles, hugs, even tears in the Lucent crowd.</p>
        <p>In one variation or another, that scene has been repeated hundreds of times in the last year, as companies increasingly make going public into an event, hoping to stand out in the crowd. And what a crowd it is. If current trends hold up, April will be the hottest month ever for raising money in new issues.</p>
        <p>Wall Street's roaring bull is allowing a throng of companies to tap the market for money. But as a few recent sharp declines suggest, the market's strength -- based in part on a five-year-old economic expansion -- will not last forever. At some point, investors will undoubtedly have their fill of these newly minted companies, and the window for new stock issues will close. That prospect is making the current rush to the starting gate all the more jammed.</p>
        <p>New York, as the capital of capitalism, makes it all happen. Wall Street orchestrates, and lives off, these stock offering deals, through which shares in private companies are made available for sale to the public for the first time.</p>
        <p>The blockbuster fees generated by mergers and acquisitions get more attention because the deals are bigger. But securities firms typically collect 7 percent of the value of a stock offering, compared with 1 percent of a merger, said Richard J. Peterson, an analyst at the Securities Data Company. Only once in the last dozen years, 1989, have merger fees surpassed stock offering fees, which already exceed $700 million this year. Lucent rained $117.6 million on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>From the pockets of investment bankers, that money gets sprinkled around. Some wends its way to printers, hotel and restaurant workers, chauffeurs and even unemployed actors on some recent occasions. The money shows up in everything from a generous tip to the shoe-shiners downtown to box seats at the  Metropolitan Opera. And a lot goes, too, into Park Avenue co-ops and summer homes in the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>In a trend likely to fatten the bonanza, some recent stock offerings are being celebrated in ways that go beyond the traditional exclusive breakfasts and dinners for executives and investment bankers. Now companies are using the occasion to create a public image, to foster esprit de corps among employees and to spread the action around -- as well as to forge an identity with Wall Street  brokers and traders.</p>
        <p>Along with the ubiquitous Lucite-block gewgaws for deal makers, companies like Lucent, which makes telecommunications equipment, are handing out baseball  caps at the exchange. Revlon brought the models Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford to spice up its debut in February. It also put their photos on the traditional giveaway lapel pins, instantly turning what are normally throwaways  into hot items.</p>
        <p>Cartoon character appearances -- like Spiderman for Marvel Comics and Mr. Peanut for Nabisco -- are becoming so common that last fall the Boston Beer Company did not just bring an actor playing Samuel Adams, the namesake of its label, but re-enacted the Boston Tea Party, sort of, on Broad Street.</p>
        <p>Boston Beer deployed employees and actors on a ship-shaped float. Dressed in  colonial garb, they dumped cases of imported beer into the street "to dramatize  the declaration of beer independence," C. James Koch, the chief executive, said.</p>
        <p>These antics are spreading as the number of new issues soars. Ever since the  bull market that began in the early 1980's got its second wind in 1991, private  companies with great ambitions and a need for capital have been running to investment bankers. They size up the company's prospects with investors and determine the price the shares may fetch.</p>
        <p>Lately, investors have been snapping up virtually every company on offer. Companies with a link to the Internet, no matter how tenuous, are the stars, commanding prices in the ionosphere. When one of them -- Yahoo -- went public last Friday, it soared from an offering price of $13 to $43 and closed at $33.</p>
        <p>But restaurants, makers of luxury goods, retailers and manufacturers are feasting on the market's plenty, too -- even some that have failed before. On Wednesday, for example, Donna Karan International, the fashion house that found little interest in a stock offering in 1993, said it would try again later this year.</p>
        <p>So far in 1996, 198 companies have sold $12.6 billion worth of new stock, more than double the money raised in the corresponding period in 1995, according to Securities Data. The pace so far this year is running ahead of 1993, when a record $34 billion was raised.</p>
        <p>The numbers add up to good news for the economy, simply because initial public offerings fuel dreams. By allowing companies to raise money, usually to pursue growth and invest in new ideas, they help drive innovation, technological advances and productivity gains.</p>
        <p>For a long time, Wall Street has kept mum on how new stock offerings actually happen, partly in fear of running afoul of Federal regulations that forbid anyone involved to hype a stock, partly out of reluctance to demystify the process.</p>
        <p>But the move to make the offerings into events is changing that. Although each stock offering is different, there are certain traditions and rituals. When a company goes public on the New York Stock Exchange, its chief executive normally rings the opening bell. He usually makes the first trade, too, though some companies delegate the tasks.</p>
        <p>Most companies, however, go public on Nasdaq, an electronic market that has no trading floor. So the scene takes place on the trading floor of the lead investment firm. A banker there balances the initial buy and sell orders, while  the company's executives watch and then head out for a lunch.</p>
        <p>With so many deals, some on the trading floors take a jaundiced view of the hoopla. "We want them to get out of here so we can get back to business," said one investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "This is a big important event in their life, and they're fascinated. But we want to declare victory and get on with it."</p>
        <p>Some people with long memories or a sense of history also find much of the hoopla a bit hard to countenance. Robert Sobel, a business historian at Hofstra  University, pointed out that as recently as 40 years ago, common stocks were considered too speculative for the average person.</p>
        <p>It was not even until 1984 that the New York Stock Exchange began to trade in new issues. By then, the business was too big to ignore.</p>
        <p>Today, the issues that go public on the Big Board generate the most folderol. The day typically begins with breakfast in the private dining rooms of the exchange's high-ceilinged Luncheon Club. Lucent had to give a lunch, thanks to the long-scheduled breakfast appearance by President Scalfaro of Italy.</p>
        <p>Whether it is breakfast or lunch, the two chairmen -- of the exchange and the company -- bring gifts. Mr. Grasso gave Mr. Schacht the traditional bronze medallion depicting a bull and a bear. Mr. Schacht handed over what he called "the obligatory hat that goes with the obligatory T-shirt and a sweater," all bearing Lucent's red logo.</p>
        <p>As the culmination of weeks or months of work, those involved in stock issues are glad it is over. The so-called dog-and-pony shows, a routine of speeches, videos and slides that executives make to countless potential investors, end the night before opening day.</p>
        <p>Big issues like Lucent generate so much attention that three teams traversed  the country for 11 days, three or four cities a day, on the roadshows. More than 400 people packed the Terrace Room of the Plaza Hotel for the biggest.</p>
        <p>Luckily for Lucent's weary executives, Morgan Stanley, the lead investment banker, cut the schedule short. With demand for the stock high and the market looking volatile, the bankers decided to go on April 4, rather than later in the month.</p>
        <p>The night before, they huddled with executives from AT&amp;T, which was spinning  off Lucent as part of its plan to split into three companies, to agree on the offering price of $27. The deal signed, "everyone drank champagne," one participant said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schacht and the rest of the roadshow teams were still calling on customers. They did not return to the area until 10 or 11 P.M.</p>
        <p>The next day, the big suspense was the price at which Lucent would open trading. Investment bankers consider the job well done if the stock begins trading at 5 to 20 percent above the offering price. Lucent fell within the range at $31.875, without going too high. "They'd be disappointed if it ended up at $36," a veteran said. Too much money would have been left on the table.</p>
        <p>For Carleton S. Fiorina, an executive vice president at Lucent, the process was "exhausting and chaotic, but also exhilarating." Ms. Fiorina, who piloted Lucent's efforts to go public, added, "I feel like I've given birth here, literally."</p>
