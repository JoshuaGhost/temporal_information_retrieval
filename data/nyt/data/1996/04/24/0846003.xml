        <p>By the time the ball left Chris Jones's bat, the night had turned soggy then  wacky, and then the night turned into morning. Beyond midnight and beyond reason, with a soaked crowd reduced to friends and family, the Mets played a game that had interminable written all over it.</p>

        <p>By the time the ball left Chris Jones's bat, the night had turned soggy then  wacky, and then the night turned into morning. Beyond midnight and beyond reason, with a soaked crowd reduced to friends and family, the Mets played a game that had interminable written all over it.</p>
        <p>But by the time the ball landed -- that is, if it has landed -- the night the Mets could have called many nasty names could not be considered lost. Jones hit  Jeff Shaw's hanging slider beyond the left-field bullpen, an estimated 444-foot  shot, to give the Mets a 8-6 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.</p>
        <p>Roy Hobbs," Jeff Kent observed, at the end of an evening that had seemed sure to become a natural disaster for the Mets.</p>
        <p>"It hung a little bit," Jones said.</p>
        <p>His first home run of the season, made louder by the absence of much other noise at 12:23 A.M., gave the Mets a record of 7-11 after they won consecutive games for the first time this season.</p>
        <p>The night's struggle held many elements of a season with its nagging self-doubt. The Mets made three errors, two by Rey Ordonez. The bullpen contributed to the loss of three leads before Doug Henry (1-0) earned a victory  with a perfect 10th.</p>
        <p>The Mets fell behind even after Jose Vizcaino scored a go-ahead run from second base on Rico Brogna's strikeout, Johnny Ruffin's wild pitch on strike three and a throwing error by the catcher Joe Oliver in the seventh.</p>
        <p>They were forced to extra innings even after loading the bases with one out in the ninth, with the Cincinnati outfield positioned at T-ball length. Brogna's more conventional strikeout, on a nasty breaking ball by Marcus Moore, was followed by Todd Hundley's flyout to right field that made the long night longer.</p>
        <p>By the end, all that hardship was the stuff of conversation for an overnight  flight to St. Louis. "We really needed it," said Lance Johnson, whose seventh-inning triple -- his second of the game and league-leading sixth of the  season -- energized his team.</p>
        <p>Bobby Jones, starting for the first time since his two starts in the extended spring training program, did not allow a ball to be hit out of the infield in the first three innings, pitched five and a third strong innings, yet had nothing to show for his effort. He was the pitcher of record when the rains came with the Mets ahead by two runs but two Reds on base in the sixth.</p>
        <p>A long, hard, windy rain caused a delay of 1 hour 51 minutes that ended Jones's night of work and began the bullpen's latest adventure.</p>
        <p>Bob MacDonald, inheriting a 2-0 count against Hal Morris when the game resumed, threw two balls to load the bases and start a lengthy, expletive-filled dialogue. Dallas Green, the Mets' manager, followed his pitching change by coming down off the mound toward the plate umpire, Billy Hohn. Green questioned  a ball Hohn said was low. Hohn questioned Green's question.</p>
        <p>"So after that," Green remembered, "we called each other our favorite names."</p>
        <p>The two carried on their debate nose-to-nose, before, during and after Green  was invited to leave.</p>
        <p>Jerry DiPoto replaced MacDonald, and Jones's victory vanished.</p>
        <p>DiPoto walked the pinch hitter Eric Davis on a full-count to force in Jeff Branson. Bret Boone's sacrifice fly to short right field allowed Larkin to beat  Gilkey's one-hop throw and tie the score at 4-4. Lenny Harris's pinch-hit, broken-bat single to left field scored Morris, and the Reds had a 5-4 lead.</p>
        <p>The first of two misplays by Ordonez helped Cincinnati take the lead in the fourth. Larkin's drive up the middle deflected off Jones toward the shortstop side of second. Ordonez, who had started to his left, quickly turned back to this right to reach the deflection.</p>
        <p>Ordonez was off balance, tilted with all the weight on his right foot. His flip to second, in qearch of a force, went by Vizcaino, into short right field and into foul territory.</p>
        <p>By the time Brogna retrieved the wild throw, Branson was able to tie the score. Eric Anthony's line drive single to center field scored Larkin, and the Reds had a lead, the first of several that would disappear.</p>
