        <p>When the Moon Is in the 7th House</p>
        <p>All at once, the joint is jumpin'.</p>
        <p>Invigorated by favorable reactions to five new shows -- and with four more yet to open -- Broadway is having one of its strongest Aprils in years. "The King and I" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" look like long-term Broadway tenants. Again. "Inherit the Wind" has been extended until June 2, making it the longest-running play of the dozen that Tony Randall's National Actors Theaper has presented. "A Delicate Balance" began negotiations with its stars for an extended run nanoseconds after the gushing notices began pouring in. And early returns indicate "Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk," which opened last night, is another critical hit. (Film makers are interested, too.)</p>
        <p>What a difference a month makes! At the start of March, half of Broadway's 32 commercial houses were dark. Now, only four are vacant (and two of those only because their tenants, both new plays, sank quickly). For the first time in the  Nederlander Organization's history, all nine of its theaters are filled simultaneously.</p>
        <p>What gives? Are we at the dawn of a new theatrical age or are the Broadway stars (the celestial as well as the human kind) in magical alignment? No. The season has been back-loaded to accommodate the two T's: tourists and Tonys. But  what has everybody talking is the quality of much of what is being offered. And  while there is nothing magical about it, the end of the season is so packed with new musicals that you could safely call it a harmonic convergence. 'Patton' and Rejection</p>
        <p>George C. Scott is downright gabby.</p>
        <p>Sitting at a table in Sam's, the theater hangout, the other day, Mr. Scott waxed philosophical about his life in the theater and in the movies, expressing  thoughts on everything from his debt to Joseph Papp to his dislike of performing one-man shows to his pleasure at the success of "Inherit the Wind." He even talked about the 1971 incident that made him a legendary no-show: the night he failed to collect his Oscar for "Patton."</p>
        <p>"I've never received it, never possessed it," Mr. Scott said with a laugh, about the statuette awarded to him for what was perhaps his most famous performance. He was, he said, asleep at his farm in Westchester County when Goldie Hawn opened the envelope at the Academy Awards and shrieked the now-famous words, "Oh my God, it's George C. Scott!"</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott's failure to appear, together with his reluctance over the years to speak to the press, created the impression that he disdained the attention. In reality, the actor says, he simply wanted to protect himself from rejection.</p>
        <p>"I was n'minated very early in my career, for 'Anatomy of a Murder,' " Mr. Scott, 68, said. "I wanted it badly and I didn't get it and I was angry. And I said to myself, 'I'm never going to allow myself to be that vulnerable again.' "</p>
        <p>Mr. Scott, who now lives in Malibu, Calif., says it is a kick to be back in a hit, his biggest Broadway success since "Sly Fox" 20 years ago. "You don't hear  any coughing," he said, referring to that unmistakable sign of a bored audience. Of his own health problems, which have forced him to miss several performances,  the actor would say only that he was "very ill" for a week with intestinal flu and that he still must have a "little operation," about which he did not elaborate.</p>
        <p>Location, Location, Etc.</p>
        <p>Is a puzzlement: At the MCC Theater, audiences could not get enough of "Nixon's Nixon." But at the Westside Theater, they can. The play, a satirical conjuring by Russell Lees of the encounter between Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger on the night before Nixon resigned, had a sold-out run at MCC earlier  this season. But since the play's move last month to the Westside on West 43d Street, ticket sales have been lackluster.</p>
        <p>Gerald Schoenfeld, chairman of the Shubert Organization, lead producer of the move, says the show may be suffering from overexposure: the subject was treated  in Oliver Stone's recent film and a television movie. The larger problem may simply be a surfeit of competition on and off Broadway.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, another Off Broadway move appears imminent. Negotiations are being completed to transfer "Curtains," the New Group's acclaimed production of Stephen Bill's play about euthanasia, to a commercial Off Broadway house. It runs at the Intar Theater until May 12.</p>
        <p>A Swan Song (No, Don't Leave)</p>
        <p>Colin Martin has mixed feelings about all that he has stirred up. "I don't like people knowing this about me," he said. "I don't get off on that at a'l. For me, this play has been about making fuel out of trash."</p>
        <p>Mr. Martin was talking about "Virgins and Other Myths," his autobiographical  one-man play about growing up gay and becoming a sex addict, an obsession that led him into prostitut'on. The play was so successful at Primary Stages that it  moved this month to the Atlantic Theater on West 20th Street for an open-ended run, all of which has come as something of a surprise to Mr. Martin, 33.</p>
        <p>"The irony is, I wrote this piece as a final step before I left the business," he said, adding that the play's reception in New York and before that, Los Angeles, had changed his life. Before it, he said, "I was working for  1-800-BALLOON and walking Johnny Depp's dog."</p>
        <p>The Bronx and Staten Island, Too</p>
        <p>In the past, anyone who wanted free Shakespeare had to stand in line in Manhattan. Now, for the first time, theatergoers will be able to stand in the other boroughs too. The New York Shakespeare Festival will, on selected dates throughout the summer, be handing out tickets in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island to that day's show in Central Park. The first, for "Henry V," will be June 20 at three Staten Island locations.</p>
        <p>In news from other theater locations:</p>
        <p>*Melissa Errico and Malcolm Gets are performing in a reading today of "The Triumph of Love," a musical by James Magruder (book), Jeffrey Stock (music) and  Susan Birkenhead (lyrics). The reading is produced by the Roundabout Theater and the producer Margo Lion.</p>
        <p>*Next year, the Tonys inaugurate an award for best orchestration, the first new category since revivals were divided into plays and musicals.</p>
        <p>*The Drama League, the only theater group that presents awards voted on by theatergoers, is presenting an award next month for "unique contribution to the  theater" to state and city officials, as well as executives of the Walt Disney Company, Livent and the New Victory Theater for the redevelopment of 42d Street. Julia Hansen, the league's president, said the project was a milestone in fostering theater in New York.</p>
