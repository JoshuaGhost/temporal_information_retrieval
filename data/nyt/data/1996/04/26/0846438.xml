        <p>The Swiss Reinsurance Company said yesterday that its net income rose 17.4 percent in 1995 as investment income rose, claims payouts fell and a one-time gain helped earnings. Profit of the company rose to 1.095 billion Swiss francs ($887 million), the highest in its history, from 932 million francs a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Swiss Re, the world's second-largest reinsurance company behind Munich Re of Germany, said after-tax profit before extraordinary items and payments rose 53 percent, to 1.09 billion francs from 709 million francs. The company said it had a one-time gain of 11 million francs. Swiss Re said it planned to pay a dividend of 22.5 Swiss francs a share, up from 15 a year earlier.</p>
