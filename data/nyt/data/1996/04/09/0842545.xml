        <p>Elisa Izquierdo's five siblings have been placed in foster homes, where they  seem to be doing as well as could be expected, child-welfare officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The five have been evaluated and, in the words of the New York State Department of Social Services, "are not exhibiting post-trauma effects." The five visit one another regularly but have no contact with their mother, Awilda Lopez, or her husband, Carlos Lopez, both of whom have been charged with beating Elisa, 6, to death in their Manhattan home last November.</p>
