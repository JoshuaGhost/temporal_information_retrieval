        <p>Jessica Foschi, the Old Brookville, L.I., swimmer who tested positive for steroids last summer in a case that intensified the debate over testing procedures and penalties, has been cleared of all charges by an arbitration panel.</p>
        <p>The American Arbitration Association decision means that the 15-year-old Foschi can compete with a clean slate and without undergoing periodic drug tests as part of a two-year suspension by United States Swimming. Foschi was put on probation, then suspended, then put back on probation, enabling her to compete in the Olympic trials last month. She did not qualify.</p>
