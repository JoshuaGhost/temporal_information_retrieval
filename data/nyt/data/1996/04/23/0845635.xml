        <p>I liked the reed dude," a casually dressed young man sitting near me remarked after the Ensemble Modern's concert on Saturday night at Alice Tully Hall. I think he meant the bassoonist. It was a different audience from the usual crowd that attends New York contemporary-music concerts. The likely explanation was the presence of four short classical compositions by Frank Zappa. The late rocker's fans were out in force, delivering a huge roar of approval when the manically clever "G-Spot Tornado" closed the concert with a stroke of a giant gong.</p>
        <p>But the Zappa-heads were not sole ly responsible for the electric atmosphere. The Ensemble Modern, on its first North American tour, confirmed the impression  of extreme virtuosity, fervent commitment and bewildering versatility that new-music fans have gained from this German group's numerous recordings. If any  avant-garde diehards in the audience bemoaned the inclusion of Zappa as a commercial ploy, they misunderstood both the earnest intent and playful spirit of the effort.</p>

The late rocker's fans were out in force, delivering a huge roar of approval when the manically clever "G-Spot Tornado" closed the concert with a stroke of a giant gong.</p>
        <p>But the Zappa-heads were not sole ly responsible for the electric atmosphere. The Ensemble Modern, on its first North American tour, confirmed the impression  of extreme virtuosity, fervent commitment and bewildering versatility that new-music fans have gained from this German group's numerous recordings. If any  avant-garde diehards in the audience bemoaned the inclusion of Zappa as a commercial ploy, they misunderstood both the earnest intent and playful spirit of the effort.</p>
        <p>John Adams was the engaging, precise conductor. He led pinpoint performances of Varese's "Octandre," Conlon Nancarrow's Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Studies (orchestrated by Yvar Mikhashoff) and his own Chamber Symphony. There were also  two brand new works, written for the current pour: Mr. Adams's "Scratchband" and Wolfgang Rihm's "Gejagte Form."</p>
        <p>Having achieved considerable, well-earned fame with "Harmonielehre" and "Nixon in China," Mr. Adams has traveled more obscure avenues in recent years. The Chamber Symphony, written for nearly the same ensemble as Schoenberg's work  in that genre, delves into thickets of dissonance, thorny instrumental textures and conflicting layers of rhythm (showing the clear influence of Mr. Nancarrow's visionary experiments). Its best movement is the "Aria With Walking  Bass," a spacious tone picture vaguely reminiscent of Bruckner's Fifth Symphony.</p>
        <p>T'e danger elsewhere is a tendency toward nervous fidgeting. Sixteenth-note runs in the winds make a fine display for the Modern virtuosos but soon begin to sound mannered. That tendency came even more to the fore in the frantic, curiously static "Scratchband," more Minimalist than any of Mr. Adams's other recent pieces. There is some ingenious blending of classical and rock instrumentation, with electric guitars scurrying in treble and bass (at one point flirting with Paul McCartney's "Helter-Skelter"). In time, slow, sumptuous brass harmonies make a welcome contrast, but then the work abruptly ends. What has become of those glorious "Nixon" themes?</p>
        <p>The true revelation was Mr. Rihm's "Hunted Form," a bold drama in sound from  the leading younger figure in German music. The work begins with a barrage of bustling triplet figures in the winds, fractured to the point of anarchy. But this is purposelessness with purpose. Increasing repetition of patterns and rapid drumbeats (bongo, conga, tom-tom) create a delirious momentum, above which the brass shouts out complex progressions of clusters and plain triads interlocked. Glimpses of a noble order flash against chaos; sudden silence resumes the mystery. Mr. Rihm is a Romantic at heart, and he has the means to realize his grand, obscure visions.</p>
        <p>And yes, the Zappa pieces were great fun.</p>
