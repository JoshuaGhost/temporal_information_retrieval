        <p>In recent years, there have been many concerts at the Beacon Theater at which long lines at the ticket pickup window have kept fans waiting outside as the performance began. There have also been many shows at which ushers too proud to  whisper have disrupted songs as they've moved people in and out of seats. But before this weekend, there hadn't been a show at the Beacon that this critic has seen, not even those of Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, at which nearly every person stood through the entire concert, hanging on to the singer's every word and cheering loudly for almost every other lyric and line of dialogue. That was  the case, however, when Ani DiFranco performed on Friday night at the theater, demonstrating the power of music to bring a community together and mobilize it to thought and, perhaps in some cases, action.</p>
        <p>Ms. DiFranco is a self-made star. At 18, after three years of performing, she began releasing her own albums (taking care of everything from producing to song publishing herself) and financing her own tours. Now 25, on the verge of releasing her eighth album, Ms. DiFranco has become one of the country's most successful completely independent musicians, strumming folk songs that mix experience and opinion with the energy and vehemence of punk-rock.</p>

        <p>In recent years, there have been many concerts at the Beacon Theater at which long lines at the ticket pickup window have kept fans waiting outside as the performance began. There have also been many shows at which ushers too proud to  whisper have disrupted songs as they've moved people in and out of seats. But before this weekend, there hadn't been a show at the Beacon that this critic has seen, not even those of Bob Dylan or Bruce Springsteen, at which nearly every person stood through the entire concert, hanging on to the singer's every word and cheering loudly for almost every other lyric and line of dialogue. That was  the case, however, when Ani DiFranco performed on Friday night at the theater, demonstrating the power of music to bring a community together and mobilize it to thought and, perhaps in some cases, action.</p>
        <p>Ms. DiFranco is a self-made star. At 18, after three years of performing, she began releasing her own albums (taking care of everything from producing to song publishing herself) and financing her own tours. Now 25, on the verge of releasing her eighth album, Ms. DiFranco has become one of the country's most successful completely independent musicians, strumming folk songs that mix experience and opinion with the energy and vehemence of punk-rock.</p>
        <p>Like Alanis Morissette, Ms. DiFranco expresses her anger not with a scream but with a slightly quirky warble. But she speaks to her mostly female audience  more directly and frankly than Ms. Morissette does. During her two-hour concert, Ms. DiFranco drew life lessons from sexual molestation, her first period and experiences at other concerts.</p>
        <p>"I'll just tell you why I'm here," she sang in "Willing to Fight." "Because I know the biggest crime/Is just to throw up your hands/Say this has nothing to do with me." To back up her points, Ms. DiFranco strummed her acoustic guitar with long false fingernails, insuring that every attack was as sharp and abrasive as her lyrics.</p>
        <p>Though the audience seemed to adore Ms. DiFranco for her strengths, many of her songs were about her weaknesses: the man or woman she shouldn't let back into her life but does, the burnout she encounters while on the road, her insecurities and frustrations. "I think the reason I created this job," she said during the show, "is so I can stomp around and be strong for two hours."</p>
        <p>Of course, it is precisely Ms. DiFranco's ability to be realistic about the limits of music's transformative powers and to tie her desire for change to her  own life experiences that enable her to make music that can be inspirational without being overly sappy, insincere or self-pitying.</p>
